   President Bush on Wednesday ended the nation's
last price controls on natural gas and announced his administration
will travel the country soliciting suggestions for an energy policy
keyed to market forces.
   ``Our task ... is to build the national consensus necessary to
support this strategy,'' the president said in signing a bill
ending the last wellhead price controls on natural gas, 35 years
after they were begun.
   The law Bush signed before a White House audience of members of
Congress from oil producing states and industry representatives
removes controls on the remaining one-third of natural gas supplies
subject to price ceilings. The ceilings will be abolished by
January 1993 for existing wells and by May 1991 for wells drilled
from now on.
   The end of price controls is expected to have little or no
effect in consumer markets since gas is selling well below the
current ceilings.
   Years of price controls proved bad for producers and consumers,
Bush contended, and were responsible for ``the damaging natural gas
shortages of the '70s and for gas market distortions that exist to
this very day.''
   Natural gas supplies one quarter of the nation's energy. A 1978
law permitted the decontrol of most supplies starting in 1985, but
the bill Bush signed was necessary to free the rest.
   Gas prices have fallen from a peak average of $2.69 per thousand
cubic feet at the wellhead in 1984, when homeowners paid an average
of $6.12, to $1.71 last year, when homeowners averaged $5.46.
   Bush called the natural gas deregulation his administration's
``first major energy initiative.''
   ``Experience shows that deregulation works to serve consumers
and to serve an expanding economy,'' Bush said in a bill-signing
ceremony in the East Room. ``It's a tribute to the American
political system that after decades of disagreement over the merits
of gas decontrol we can gather here today to state a clear message
for all to hear.
   ``We have learned form the past. We are united in the conviction
that the best way to deal with our energy problems and serve the
American people is to let our market economy work.''
   Bush announced he was directing Energy Secretary James Watkins
to come up with a national strategy that will seek to balance the
nation's need for reasonably priced energy supplies, commitment to
a safer and healthier environment, a strong economy and reduced
dependence on foreign energy suppliers.
   Bush said he would continue pushing for tax incentives to prop
up declining domestic oil production, although he acknowledged he
was unlikely to win action in Congress this year.
   Many in the industry have advocated protective tariffs or import
quotas to support domestic production, now only 62 percent of
consumption, but both the Bush and the Reagan administrations have
resisted on the grounds such protection, by raising prices, would
cost more jobs than it would preserve _ 400,000 vs. 120,000,
according to a 1987 Energy Department study of a $10 per barrel
tariff.
   The administration's policy drafting comes when
environmentalists are increasing their attacks on the use of fossil
fuels, which worsens the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the
globe, and when the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in Alaska has
prompted Congress to expand the areas of federal offshore waters
that are closed to oil and gas exploration.
   Later, before skeptical members of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, Watkins defended the need for new hearings.
   ``With the lack of credibiity my department has right now, I
don't think we can pontificate on what the energy policy should
be,'' Watkins said.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., noted that national energy issues have
been studied for a decade and ``it seems like we're kind of
stirring the broth again.''
   ``This is no time for complacency,'' Bush said said. ``Our
energy security problem continues. Conservation achievements are
leveling off, domestic oil production continuing its downward
trend. And petroleum imports are increasing. And our need for a
cleaner environment is obvious to all.''
   Watkins cited several administration concerns: Domestic oil
production is at its lowest point in 25 years while imports, still
almost 20 percent below the 1977 peak, are 65 percent higher than
in 1985.
   ``Environmental concerns are putting new pressures on our
ability to use our most abundant domestic fuels like coal.
Electricity reserve margins are shrinking across the country,''
Watkins said.
   Further, he said, public confidence in the energy industry ``is
at a new low,'' aggravated by Alaska spill.
   Even as Watkins was speaking, utilities in the P-J-M power pool
serving 21 million people in most of New Jersey, Maryland and
Pennsylvania and all of Delaware and the District of Columbia
imposed a 5 percent voltage reduction, the third this year, to
preserve generating capacity on a hot day of heavy electricity
demand when seven generating plants were out of service.
   Watkins said his department will hold public hearings, beginning
Tuesday in Washington and followed by sessions in Tulsa, Okla. on
Aug. 8, Boise, Idaho on Aug. 23; Seattle on Aug. 30 and Louisville,
Ky. on Sept. 8, all aimed at producing a draft plan by April 1.
   He said the administration had no ``central preconceived focus''
for the strategy and would evaluate every energy source, including
conservation. But he indicated he will be pushing for renewed
emphasis on nuclear power.
   He said he would be taking unspecified steps to keep New York
State from dismantling the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long
Island, a fully licensed plant that has never operated commercially.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who attended the ceremony, said
decontrolling natural gas ``takes this wet blanket that has crushed
incentive off the industry'' and, with environmental concerns
increasing the attractiveness of gas, ``opens up the ability to
have a full-blown exploration boom.''
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement: ``Everybody is a
winner.''

<HEAD>American Takes Record for Fastest Trans-Atlantic Sea Crossing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. MARY'S, Isles of Scilly (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American powerboat racer Tom
Gentry set a record Thursday for the fastest trans-Atlantic
crossing.
   The wealthy 58-year-old property developer from Honolulu and his
five-man crew aboard the Gentry Eagle crossed the finish line at
Bishop Rock lighthouse off the Isles of Scilly at 3:56 a.m. (10:56
p.m. EDT Wednesday).
   Their voyage from Ambrose Light, New York, to Bishop Rock took
two days, 14 hours and seven minutes.
   The previous record was held by British business tycoon Richard
Branson.
   In June 1986, Branson and his team completed the 3,386-mile
crossing aboard the 72-foot powerboat Virgin Atlantic Challenger II
in three days, eight hours and 31 minutes.
   Gentry tried the break the record in July 1988, but equipment
aboard his 110-foot powerboat Continental Proud Bird was damaged in
heavy seas and he was force to abandon the crossing after traveling
1,500 miles.
   Branson, whose business interests include the airline Virgin
Atlantic and a records and entertainment empire, tried to claim the
150-year-old Blue Riband trophy for his 1986 crossing, which cut
two hours and nine minutes off the speed record held since 1952 by
the American liner United States.
   But the U.S. Merchant Marine Museum at King's Point, New York,
refused to hand over the trophy. Museum curator Frank Braynard said
at the time that it was for ocean liners, not ``little toy boats''
like Virgin Atlantic Challenger II.
   Branson then offered his own Virgin Atlantic Challenger Trophy
to anyone who could beat his record, saying he wanted to ``promote
and encourage new technology.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Drug Addicts Rounded Up In 48 Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of drug addicts have been
rounded up and sent to labor camps with the expiration of a
six-month grace period that abusers were given to kick the habit,
Tehran radio reported.
   The deadline expired Sunday and drug addicts are now being
arrested as common criminals, said the broadcast, monitored Tuesday
in Nicosia.
   Mokhtar Kalantari, head of an intensive anti-narcotics campaign
launched last year, told the radio that every Iranian province will
have a hard labor camp to house the addicts.
   Iran has 50 million people and an estimated 2 million drug
addicts.
   Reports in recent days said 40 percent of the divorces in the
country are caused by drugs.
   Kalantari said that in the initial stage of the crackdown,
15,000 drug abusers will be sent to labor camps and another 40,000
will be cared for by the prison system.
   The fierce anti-narcotics campaign was launched following the
August cease-fire in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war.
   In the first phase of the crackdown, authorities focused on
stamping out drug traffickers: About 800 alleged drug smugglers
have been hanged since December.

<TEXT>
   For a country still with a monarchy after more
than a thousand years many Britains are dunces about their kings
and queens, according to a survey released today.
   The Gallup Poll said six out of 10 people interviewed did not
know who won the Battle of Hastings.
   Half of those questioned did not know how many wives King Henry
VIII had.
   Six out of 10 did not know which monarch was beheaded by
parliamentarians, eight in 10 could not name the king in power
during the American revolution and just three people in 10 knew who
would follow Prince Charles to the throne.
   Comments on the poll results said more men than women knew about
the violent aspects of the monarchy, including beheadings and
battles, but more than half the women knew that Queen Elizabeth I
was known as the Virgin Queen while only four men in 10 had the
right answer.
   Of the 917 people across the country were interviewed last month
for the survey, those who displayed the greatest ignorance were in
the 16-to-24 age group. No margin of error was given for the survey.
   The answers:
   Duke William of Normandy defeated King Harold II at Hastings in
1066 and then had himself crowned King William I in Westminster
Abbey. The modern monarchy is dated from William but he was
preceded by 17 Saxon and three Danish monarchs.
   King Henry VIII had six wives. He divorced two, had two
beheaded, one died and one outlived him.
   King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 by parliamentarians led by
Oliver Cromwell.
   King George III was the king when the American colonies defeated
the British and became the United States.
   Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles, is second in
line to the throne following his father, who is to succeed Queen
Elizabeth II.
   The survey was commissioned by Royal Britain, a permanent London
exhibition about British royal history. The exhibition opened last
year near the Barbican subway station.

   It's so hot in Britain that an overheated hedgehog
got its head caught in a water tap, and shrimp are mysteriously
turning up in Cheshire tap water.
   It's hot enough to fry a cliche on the sidewalk, though it must
be said that the sunnyside-up egg commissioned for Tuesday's
editions of the tabloid Daily Mirror appeared distinctly
undercooked and runny.
   It was _ have mercy! _ a scorching 88 degrees in Great Malvern
on Tuesday. A sizzling 86 in London.
   Saturday's high of 93.5 degrees at Heathrow airport was the
hottest temperature recorded on the sceptered isle since a 96.6
reading on July 3, 1976.
   If that sounds like blessed relief to residents of Bullhead
City, Ariz., where it was 117 on Monday, bear in mind that this is
Britain, where 99 is the all-time high.
   This is the island, Vladimir Nabokov once joked, where spring
and summer come nearly every year.
   Keep in mind, too, that Britain isn't designed for summer.
Commuter trains don't have fans, only windows that provide a
cooling breath if the train happens to be moving.
   Ice is a rare commodity in stores, air conditioning is spotty
and refrigerators are often puny little things.
   It's also been dry, with places in the southwest getting less
than one inch of rain since May.
   To judge by London's tabloids, the suffering is intense.
``Baking Britain put the world's hot spots in the shade,'' The Sun
reported Tuesday, appending a highly selective list of places that
happened to be cooler. Bullhead City wasn't mentioned.
   The heat wave was believed to be a factor in the strange
appearance of shrimp, some half an inch long, that were an
unexpected bonus in tap water in Cheshire. The North West Water
Authority said the shellfish were harmless though some customers,
it conceded, might be put off.
   Businessmen dared to go bare _ ``A lot of men are wearing shorts
to work,'' said Janice English of the British Clothing Industry
Association _ and a plumber was seen strolling into the prime
minister's residence at 10 Downing St. wearing only his shoes and a
pair of cutoff jeans.
   In neighboring Ireland, ice cream sales are up 30 percent or
more from last summer, according to the Valley Ice Cream Co. But
all the sunshine has been murder on the trout, with hundreds
reportedly dying in depleted streams.
   The hot days have been especially miserable in West London,
where hundreds of homes lost their water supply. Authorities had
shut down part of a treatment plant to deal with a mayfly
infestation, the customers having found the fly larvae unacceptable
in their tea or bath.
   It was the heat, according to firemen in Lincoln, that drove
that hedgehog to stick its snout too far into a garden tap.
   It was hot Tuesday, so hot that the Forestry Commission was
thinking gloomy thoughts about Christmas. The heat, the commission
said, was stunting the Christmas tree crop in Sherwood Forest.

   A tearful Miss Idaho was crowned
Miss Teen USA 1989 on Tuesday in a pageant televised in two dozen
countries.
   Brandi Sherwood, 18, of Idaho Falls, was chosen from among 51
contestants, representing each state and the District of Columbia.
   The seventh annual show was held at the National Orange
Showgrounds in this city 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   She received a crown and a bouquet of flowers on stage from her
predecessor, Mindy Duncan, 17, of Newberg, Ore., pageant officials
said.
   Ms. Sherwood wins nearly $150,000 in cash and prizes, including
a car, jewelry, one-year scholarship and three-week European
``fashion study tour.'' Various sponsors supplied the prizes.
   The runner-up was Miss Teen Kentucky, Kristi Dawn Hicks, 17, of
Bardstown, Ken.
   Second runnerup was Miss Teen Vermont, Kara Quinn, 15, of
Rutland, Vt. Third runnerup was Miss Teen Texas, Kristi Wright, 16,
Del Rio, Texas, and fourth runnerup was Miss Teen North Dakota,
Heidi Jo Lanseth, 17, of Fargo, N.D.
   The show, which aired on CBS, was hosted by talk show host Wil
Shriner and Marcia Strassman, who appeared in the movie ``Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids.''
   The contestants, ages 15 to 18, were judged on the basis of two
days of interviews, an evening gown competition and a swimsuit
contest, said Mary Chervenak, a pageant spokeswoman.

<HEAD>London Festival Ballet Opens with `Romeo'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The London Festival Ballet opened for two weeks
at the Metropolitan Opera House with Sir Frederick Ashton's ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' and the evening was a triumph for Peter Schaufuss as
Romeo.
   Schaufuss, at 40, looked youthful and single-mindedly ardent
about Juliet, danced Tuesday by 20-year-old Susan Hogard. A native
of Australia voted ``best newcomer'' by a dance magazine two years
ago, Miss Hogard is very good but her Juliet stopped short of being
incandescent.
   Miss Hogard seemed more comfortable with the later part of the
ballet, when Juliet is making more mature decisions about how to
keep from marrying Paris, than in the beginning, when the character
is more girlish.
   Schaufuss has been the company's artistic director since 1984.
One of his first moves was to talk Sir Frederick into helping stage
his ``Romeo'' for this company. Sir Frederick choreographed it to
Prokofiev's music in 1955 for the Royal Danish Ballet, where
Schaufuss' mother, Mona Vangsaa, was the original Juliet and his
father, Frank Schaufuss, was the original Mercutio. The company
dropped the ballet in 1965 and Schaufuss didn't want it to be lost.
   It is more spare, in numbers of dancers, scenery and general
ambiance, than Sir Kenneth MacMillan's 1965 ``Romeo and Juliet''
for the British Royal Ballet.
   Niels-Bjorn Larsen, the original Tybalt, helped stage this
production. On Tuesday, Frank Schaufuss was the Prince of Verona,
who tries to keep the peace. The well-known British dancers
Alexander Grant and Lynn Seymour were Lord and Lady Capulet. Graham
Bond conducted the evening, which was dedicated to the memory of
Sir Frederick.
   One high point of the opening night performance was the trio,
showing happiness and friendship, of Romeo, Mercutio (Maximiliano
Guerra) and Benvolio (Matz Skoog). Guerra, a native of Argentina
who won a gold medal at the Varna International Ballet Competition
last year, was a charming, fleet, light-hearted Mercutio.
   His opposite, the heavy-handed, arrogant Tybalt, was danced with
aplomb by London-born Nicholas Johnson, a company member since 1975.
   The London Festival Ballet changed its name to the English
National Ballet on June 1 but appeared last week in Washington and
now in New York under the old name. Its last American tour was 11
years ago.
   Princess Margaret, who has been the company's patron for 13
years, was in the audience Tuesday night, making her last official
appearance as patron. Her suggestion that the Princess of Wales
succeed her when the name changed has been taken.

   Scores of reinforcements moved into
central Idaho's Gospel Hump Wilderness on Tuesday in a second day
of battling two raging wilderness fires, one of which doubled in
size for the second day.
   Meanwhile, smoldering embers from last week's series of
dry-lightning storms sparked another blaze to the south in the
Boise National Forest.
   Additional manpower was added to the 340 firefighters on the
Johnson Butte Fire after it broke through containment lines again
Monday to sweep across grass and scattered stands of ponderosa
pine, doubling in size to 1,000 acres in steep, rugged terrain.
   The target for containment was pushed back two days to Saturday,
and officials predicted the fire would cover 5,000 acres before it
was finally reined in.
   Nez Perce National Forest fire bosses also hoped to bring
manpower up to as many as 300 on the smaller but more intense Cape
Horn Fire, burning on 170 acres of heavier fuel in an almost
inaccessible canyon about 12 miles to the east.
   No private property was threatened by either fire.
   Meanwhile, far to the northeast, hundreds of fires had blackened
more than 2.2 million acres of forest in northern Manitoba and
Saskatchewan. Canadian officials said the flames had forced the
evacuation of more than 19,000 people.
   Thousands of gallons of chemical retardant were dropped by
aerial tankers in an unsuccessful bid to stop the Johnson Butte
blaze Monday. Flames overran a break on the northern fire line and
began spreading south to the main Salmon River.
   The Johnson Butte Fire grew from 1,000 to 2,000 acres on Tuesday
as crews worked to establish lines of defense against the flames
burning through grass and scattered stands of ponderosa pine.
   ``The fire moved more quickly than they estimated so they had to
abandon that line,'' spokeswoman Elayne Murphy said. ``It's just
real steep, rugged terrain and inaccessible, so in order to fight
this fire what they're doing is identifying places that are
accessible and digging in there.''
   Ground crews, backed up by five helicopters, had three miles of
fire line but had to carve six more miles.
   Crews had to hike four miles just to get to the perimeter of the
Cape Horn fire, and began work on a landing zone to make that blaze
more accessible. Three helicopters were prepared to ferry
firefighers in and out.
   No containment target was set yet.
   To the south, firefighters on Monday contained the 230-acre
Trail Fire near Sun Valley in central Idaho's Sawtooth National
Forest. The resort area was not threatened.
   ``What really saved us was that they already had an air tanker
in the air yesterday and they diverted it to us,'' spokeswoman
Barbara Todd said. ``Those four or five retardant drops helped
out.''
   Elsewhere in Idaho, the situation was improved from last week,
when a series of storms hit western and central Idaho forests with
hundreds of dry lightning strikes.

   With seven of the top 10 shows, NBC dominated
the A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings for the 56th consecutive
week, and Fox Television managed a strong showing on Sunday night.
   NBC had an overall rating of 10.8 and a 21 share for the week
ending July 23, followed by ABC with a 9.0 rating and a 17 share,
and CBS with 8.7 and a 17.
   The ratings are a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
in the United States with television. The share is the percentage
of sets in use.
   Fox Television's ``Totally Hidden Video,'' briefly shaken by the
dismissal of a producer and tossing of segments that were staged
instead of spontaneous, rebounded from 34th place to 29th place
with a 10.8 rating on Sunday night.
   It was preceded by ``America's Most Wanted,'' which also had a
10.8 rating. The two shows helped the network lead the ratings for
the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. time slot on Sunday.
   The week's Top 10: A first-place tie between NBC's ``Cheers''
and ABC's ``Roseanne,'' followed by ``A Different World,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``Dear John,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest''
and ``Hunter,'' all NBC; ``The CBS Sunday Night Movie,'' and ABC's
``The Wonder Years.''
   The five lowest-rated network shows were NBC's ``Jim Henson
Hour,'' followed in ascending order by four parts of the spoof
``Fresno'' miniseries on CBS.
   CBS won the nightly news show ratings with an average of 9.3,
followed by ABC with 9.2 and NBC with 8.6.

   Space shuttle Columbia could be
launched on a secret military mission in about two weeks if NASA
officials turn up no problems during today's flight readiness
review.
   One possible hitch could be a valve problem the cause of which
engineers have been seeking for two days. If the valve must be
replaced, it could add two to three days to the launch processing
time.
   The space agency said last week it hopes to launch Columbia
during the week of Aug. 7 with five astronauts and a Defense
Department payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   A firm launch date announcement was expected late this afternoon
after the valve problem has been thoroughly assessed and the
readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the global tracking network
and all other mission elements have been evaluated.
   The decision will come at the conclusion of a two-day review
headed by Bill Lenoir, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's acting associate administrator for space flight.
   The valve problem was detected early Monday following a brief
test firing of Columbia's three auxiliary power units, which
provide hydraulic power for moveable control surfaces such as wing
flaps, rudder and speed brake.
   Radio data indicated a hydrazine fuel valve serving one of the
units was stuck open when it should have been closed.
   Initial analysis indicated the valve worked properly and that a
bad sensor might have given a faulty reading. Engineers continued
studying the situation to learn exactly what went wrong.
   Columbia's crew members are Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, the
commander; Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr. David Leestma,
Air Force Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.

   A man's dispute with his estranged wife led
him and his half-brother to open fire on church members during a
Bible study class, killing the wife's cousin and an elderly woman,
police said Tuesday.
   Albert Lewis Jr., 33, and his half-brother, Anthony Oliver, 27,
were arrested at 7 p.m. Monday for investigation of murder in the
Friday night shooting by two hooded gunmen at Mount Olive Church of
God in Christ, said Cmdr. William Booth. They were held without
bail.
   Just hours before the attack, a judge ordered Lewis to remain
more than 100 yards from the church and several family members
after his wife, Cynthia Worthen-Lewis, claimed he had abused her,
according to court records.
   Mrs. Worthen-Lewis said that Lewis had called her earlier in the
week and said ``he was going to kill me,'' according to her court
declaration to obtain a restraining order.
   Mrs. Worthen-Lewis is the cousin of gospel singer Patronella
Worthen Luke, fatally shot in the attack that also killed
76-year-old Mae Lee and wounded Mrs. Luke's husband in the leg,
Booth said.
   ``We want to assure the public that this was not gang-related,''
Booth said. ``Detectives ... believe the shooting stemmed from a
domestic dispute.''
   Clergy members and parishioners had voiced fear that the
killings were committed by gang members or drug dealers in the
church's neighborhood.
   Ms. Lee appeared to be a bystander hit by gunfire as she went
toward the church door, but police were investigating whether she
was linked to the Luke or Lewis families, said Lt. Charles Massey.

<HEAD>State Judges Upholds Shoreham Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge on Tuesday upheld Gov. Mario
Cuomo's agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company to have the
state buy the Shoreham nuclear power plant for $1 and have it
dismantled.
   A group of Long Island residents, taxpayers, business groups and
labor unions had challenged the deal on the grounds that Cuomo had
usurped the Legislature's power.
   Last year, Cuomo and LILCO officials had negotiated a similar
Shoreham closing deal only to see it fall apart because the
Legislature wouldn't give it's required approval.
   Cuomo, castigating the Legislature for being afraid of potential
political fallout, reached a new agreement with LILCO officials in
February that he said did not require legislative input or approval.
   Lou Lewis, a Poughkeepsie, N.Y., lawyer representing the Long
Island opponents of the agreement, said Kahn's ruling would be
appealed.
   ``I feel the judge made some serious errors of fact and law,''
said Lewis. ``I find this (decision) very surprising.''
   Lewis said he had no fear of Shoreham quickly being torn down.
He noted that in addition to his lawsuit, a group of pro-nuclear
scientists, represented by the conservative Atlantic Legal
Foundation, also has a suit against the agreement pending in state
court. And he noted that the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission
still must approve the transfer of the Shoreham license from LILCO
to the state.
   Under the Shoreham agreement, already approved by LILCO
shareholders and several state agencies involved, the completed
$5.5 billion plant on the eastern end of Long Island would be sold
to the state for $1 and then the state would tear it down at
LILCO's expense.
   In return, LILCO has won agreement from the state for a series
of annual electric rate increases of about 5 percent that are
expected to go on for a decade or more. LILCO customers already pay
among the highest electric rates in the nation and the agreement to
have even higher rates is what had some legislators upset about
backing any such deal.
   Cuomo has maintained that it is cheaper to close Shoreham than
to allow it to operate. He's also argued that it's unsafe to
operate the plant because the area surrounding it couldn't be
safely evacuated if there was an emergency.
   Should the agreement be completed, it would mark the first time
in this nation's history that a completed nuclear power plant has
ever been dismantled before going ``on line.'' The Shoreham plant
has never operated at anything above a 5 percent testing level.

<HEAD>Fathers' Genes Different From Mothers' Genes, Study Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many puzzling cancers and inherited
diseases might be explained by a radical new finding that not all
genes are created equal: Genes passed on by fathers may be
different from those passed on by mothers.
   Researchers are beginning to accept evidence that began to
appear in the early 1980s suggesting that mothers and fathers each
``imprint'' genes with different signals before passing them on to
their children.
   The findings contradict one of the principles of genetics
established in the last century by Gregor Mendel _ that it made no
difference to a child whether it inherited a genetic trait from its
mother or its father.
   That now seems wrong. Genetic imprinting by mothers and fathers
may be responsible for many kinds of cancer and inherited diseases,
said Dr. Judith Hall of the University of British Columbia in
Canada.
   ``This is just absolutely mind-boggling,'' Hall said during a
meeting of geneticists at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor.
``It's a new way of thinking. Nobody believed this stuff until just
about now.''
   She said that only about one-third of inherited diseases are
explained by conventional Mendelian genetics.
   ``The problem has been how to explain the other things,'' she
said.
   Imprinting may be the answer.
   For example, children have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and they
normally get one set from each parent. But children who mistakenly
get two copies of chromosome 7 from their mother and no copy from
their father can have severe growth retardation before and after
birth.
   Conventional genetics says that shouldn't happen; all you need
is two good copies of the chromosome, and it shouldn't matter which
parent they came from.
   In another example, Hall listed, children who get a defective
copy of chromosome 15 from their fathers and a normal one from
their mothers can inherit a disease called Prader-Wili syndrome,
marked by muscle disorders and extreme obesity.
   Children, who get a defective copy of chromosome 15 from their
mothers and a normal one from their fathers, get an entirely
different disease. It is called Angelman syndrome and is marked by
bizarre, inappropriate laughter and jerky movements.
   Hall's hypothesis is that the defective chromosome 15 from the
father had a different genetic imprint than the defective
chromosome 15 from the mother.
   John Shire, a geneticist at the University of Essex in England,
said experiments with mice also have shown evidence of imprinting.
   Genetic engineering can be used, for example, to create a
fertilized mouse egg that has two sets of normal maternal
chromosomes and no paternal chromosomes.
   The egg has the appropriate number of chromosomes, but its
development is severely arrested. The egg develops into a fetus
when implanted into a mouse, but it does not produce a healthy
placenta, and the embryo dies.
   When researchers make a mouse egg with two sets of normal
paternal chromosomes, the placenta develops nicely but the fetus
doesn't, and again it dies.
   ``It takes a set from mom and a set from dad in mammals to be
viable,'' said Hall.
   This seems to be true only in mammals, not in birds or other
animals, she said.
   Cancer research has shown that in some cases losing a chromosome
from a mother is more likely to cause cancer than losing a
chromosome from a father.
   In most spontaneously arising cases of a kidney cancer called
Wilms tumor and a bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a mother's
chromosome has been lost, not a father's.
   Researchers do not know why imprinting occurs. One guess is that
it has something to do with allowing a fetus to grow inside a
mother _ a phenomenon peculiar to mammals _ without being rejected
or taking over the mother's body, Hall said.
   Some evidence of imprinting has existed since the early part of
the century, Shire said, but scientists couldn't explain it.
   ``When you get odd results, the natural feeling is to put them
on the back burner and hope one day you'll understand them,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   As Japan reels from a sex scandal
that helped topple a prime minister, the ``sexcapades'' of
Philippine lawmakers are providing Filipinos with what has turned
into a political soap opera.
   On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced he will
resign over his party's loss of 33 upper house seats, due in part
to published reports alleging Uno had kept several paid mistresses.
   Meanwhile, Philippine newspaper and radio commentators have been
titillating their audiences for weeks with rumors of affairs by
their own senators and members of the House of Representatives.
   The only casualty so far has been Sen. Orlando Mercado, who
resigned this month as Senate majority leader after rumors that he
was involved in a sex scandal. Mercado denies the allegation.
   Mercado's resignation followed newspaper reports that an
undisclosed senator had impregnated the daughter of an upper house
colleague.
   On Friday, columnist Julie Yap Daza wrote in the Manila Standard
that according to the latest rumor, an unnamed woman senator was
having an affair with her chauffeur.
   That rankled the two women in the 23-member Senate: Sen. Leticia
Ramos-Shahani and Sen. Santanina Rasul, both well into middle-age.
   They demanded an investigation by the Senate ethics committee to
put a stop to the rumors.
   According to another rumor, the chauffeur of a prominent male
senator quit his job because of the pressure of trying to keep
track of his bosses' multiple mistresses.
   In a Roman Catholic country that forbids divorce, keeping
mistresses, referred to here as ``second wives,'' is not uncommon.
Some prominent figures make little attempt to hide their ``second
wives.''
   But some commentators fear the rumors cheapen the government
institutions, which were supposed to have elevated political life
after the 1986 ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The obsession with sex scandals also distracts public and
legislative attention from pressing national problems such as
poverty, the communist insurgency and the breakdown in law and
order.
   ``The point is that sex gossip about Congress members have
become conversation pieces no longer because of their serious moral
implications but for their comic relief,'' wrote Hern Zenarosa in
the Philippines Journal.
   Senate President Jovito Salonga has resisted an investigation
into his colleagues' sex lives. The Constitution provides for
censure of congressmen guilty of ``disorderly behavior.''
   Salonga suggested that whatever happens in the bedroom ``cannot
be considered disorderly except by your mate.''
   The rumors are fueled by a practice in Philippine newspapers of
printing thinly veiled accusations, often with no source at all for
the information.
   Such allegations rarely include names. Nonetheless, they are
often accepted as gospel by a public that still distrusts
government after 20 years of misrule under Marcos.
   ``Who is that ranking congressman who regularly takes his
girlfriend via government-owned helicopter to an island mountain
resort,'' wrote columnist Emil Jurado in The Manila Standard.
   ``Would you believe that an illegitimate son of a ranking member
of Cory's (President Corazon Aquino) Cabinet has been appointed to
a very juicy position in his father's department,'' he added.

   A Continental DC-9 skidded to an emergency
landing Tuesday night at Newark International Airport after a
hydraulic failure, but none of the 89 people aboard was injured,
officials said.
   In another incident Tuesday, a United Airlines pilot who thought
his jet had lost its hydraulic system switched to a backup system
and diverted the plane to a landing at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   Flight 354 from Chicago to Newark made the emergency landing
shortly after 8 p.m., said Vincent Bonaventura, the general manager
of the airport.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker said in a telephone interview
from Houston that the plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one
of its hydraulic systems, and a partial loss of the other.
   The plane blew four of its six tires upon landing, Walker said.
Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, said the plane dumped an undetermined amount of fuel
before landing to reduce the possibility of a fire.
   ``The captain had full control of the aircraft at all times,
full control of the landing gear and flaps,'' Walker said. He said
that on a DC-9, the operation of certain controls is improved by
the hydraulics systems, but they continue working if the hydraulics
are lost.
   He said the tires blew out because the captain, following
established procedures, turned off the anti-skid system which is
designed to prevent the wheels from locking up.
   The plane ended up perpendicular to the runway after using about
three-quarters of the runway, Port Authority officials said.
   The flight's 82 passengers, who were told to brace themselves
for the emergency landing, went down an emergency ladder from the
plane along with the seven crew members.
   Passengers said they were shaken by the accident after last
week's United crash in Iowa.
   ``I realized I didn't want to die this way,'' passenger Trent
Webb said. ``You think about the crash before.''
   Sgt. Anthony Infante, who works on the Port Authority's rescue
squad, said there have been 320 hydraulic alerts this year at
Newark. But he said that inlcudes everything from a stuck light to
something as serious as Tuesday's incident.
   In the second incident, United Flight 275, en route from Chicago
to Houston's Hobby Airport, made its landing at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport late Tuesday afternoon, the airline said.
   ``It was not an emergency landing, it was a precautionary
landing,'' said United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker.
   The Boeing 737 was carrying 64 passengers, two pilots and three
flight attendants. None was injured, she said.
   The pilot suspected the jet had a hydraulic problem when a
warning light flashed on.
   ``The aircraft was checked out and the mechanics found no
problem with it,'' Ms. Dornacker said. The flight resumed at 5:30
p.m. and landed in Houston at a little more than an hour later.
   A complete hydraulic failure forced the emergency landing last
Wednesday of United Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa. The DC-10
somersaulted, broke apart and burst into flames, killing 111 people.
   An engine apparently blew itself apart on Flight 232 and severed
all three hydraulic systems, depriving the pilot of controls other
than the throttles.

<HEAD>Anti-Boredom Month Ending With a Yawn</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As National Anti-Boredom Month draws to a
close, thousands of Americans are flocking to Congress in search of
some excitement. But, alas, they are looking in the wrong place.
   At one point Tuesday, exactly 254 tourists sat in the Senate
visitors' gallery awaiting a thrilling debate. They peered down on
a nearly empty chamber where only two senators _ Sam Nunn of
Georgia and John Kerry of Massachusetts _ chatted amiably.
   ``It was kind of boring to me,'' said Bob Duax of Davenport,
Iowa, who waited five minutes for something to happen and then left.
   ``I expected to see all the senators debating a bill and sending
runners here and there to pick up something,'' he said. ``But then
I figured it's 12 o'clock and they're all at lunch.''
   Duax thought a moment and added, ``We pay them enough. They
ought to be working.''
   ``I was disappointed,'' schoolteacher Karen White of Detroit
said later. ``They were not the great orators I'd imagined.'' She
complained particularly about Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill. ``He spoke
poorly. He wasn't prepared. The analogies he drew were
elementary,'' she said.
   On the other side of the Capitol, visitors found themselves
groping through a rhetorical vegetable soup of acronyms _ MIRV,
ABM, START, TOW, HARM, MLRS _ as House members debated a $295
billion authorization bill for the Defense Department. In contrast
to the Senate, where the proceedings tend to be somnolent all year
long, the House proceedings were noisy and confusing.
   ``It was very undisciplined, it was a zoo,'' said Dave
Livingston of Nokomis, Fla., who was accompanied by his wife,
Vicki, and three daughters.
   ``No one would sit down and no one would listen. They'd bang the
gavel and 25 minutes later they were still hollering for order. I
tried to show the girls why hardly anything gets done up here.''
   When they weren't talking about stealth bombers and Star Wars
this week, legislators were saluting Little League baseball,
deploring cheap steel imports, congratulating baseball Hall of
Famer Carl Yastrzemski, urging farm belt drought relief and hearing
plaudits for Mary Brooks of Idaho, former director of the Bureau of
the Mint.
   So much for excitement in the sauna-like heat of Washington, as
Congress gasps through the summer blahs toward its month-long
summer recess starting late next week.
   July was designated National Anti-Boredom Month by the Boring
Institute of Maplewood, N.J., a tongue-in-cheek organization
founded by Alan Caruba, a free-lance journalist, public relations
consultant and presidential candidate of the Boring Party.
   The purpose of Anti-Boredom Month is to ``remind Americans, old
and young, that boredom is a silent killer of dreams, a
too-frequent precursor of depression and suicide,'' Caruba says.
   Asked if the institute recommended any special events in
Washington, he replied, ``Congress is in session.''
   Said Caruba: ``The deliberate `feel good' effort of the Reagan
years and the current `everything's fine and getting better'
message of the Bush administration is designed to lull, i.e., bore,
Americans into a docility which results in HUD scandals, savings
and loan debacles and a future spent paying for stealth bombers.''
   Americans have gotten so bored that barely half of all
registered voters cast ballots in last fall's elections, Caruba
says, and boredom is a prime suspect in school dropouts, drug
abuse, troubled marriages, declining TV audiences and low
productivity.
   America the beautiful, he says, has become ``America the bored.''
   Caruba's prescription: get a hobby, read a good book, turn off
the television when it's boring, join a community group, see your
friends, go back to school, enjoy doing routine chores and make a
``wish list'' of interesting things to do or see.
   ``Vice is nice, but in moderation,'' he says.

as many as 3,000 patients may have died prematurely after taking
heartbeat control drugs that were found to increase risk of sudden
death among some types of patients.
   Dr. Joel Morganroth, professor of medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania, said he estimated the toll after surveying 1,000
cardiologists to learn how many prescribed encainide or flecainide
for patients who had mild heartbeat irregularities after recovering
from a heart attack.
   Morganroth, who also is director of cardiac research at Graduate
Hospital in Philadelphia, said the estimate of 3,000 premature
deaths was a rough number.
   ``Let's call that the worst scenario,'' he said.
   None of the surveyed doctors were involved in drug trials that
tested encainide and flecainide, but the physicians were
prescribing the drugs for the same type of patients in the trials.
   Encainide and flecainide were approved in 1987 for preventing a
type of cardiac arrhythmia that features extra ventricular beats.
   A national study of the drugs, called the cardiac arrhythmia
suppression trial or CAST, began in June 1987. It was halted
abruptly in April when data showed sudden death rates increased
among patients taking the drugs.
   Morganroth said he conducted a random survey to determine how
many premature deaths outside the study could be associated with
the drugs.
   He said 250 cardiologists responded to his survey, half saying
they had prescribed the drugs. Based on these results, Morganroth
said he extrapolated the number of premature deaths by factoring in
national heart attack death rate statistics and the prescription
record for the two drugs.
   ``Fifteen hundred to 2,000 died, if all the assumptions are
appropriate'' in the year before the CAST study was revised, he
said. For the previous year, when the drugs were not as widely
used, he estimates the premature deaths at 750 to 1,000.
   Physicians' Weekly, which reported on the survey, called the
drug trials a ``sudden-death debacle.''
   ``Before a trial found that two drugs to block sudden death
actually triggered it, thousands may have died prematurely,'' the
magazine said.
   Patients in the CAST studies, which were initiated by the
National Institutes of Health, had suffered a heart attack and then
experienced very mild irregular ventricular heart beats. These
arrhythmias caused no noticeable problems to the patient and were
thus called asymptomatic.
   Morganroth said it was known that the sudden death rate among
such patients was 1.5 to 2 times greater than among heart attack
patients who had no such arrhythmias.
   ``CAST's objective was to take people with these arrhythmias,
give half of them sugar pills and half a drug that suppresses (the
irregular heartbeats),'' he said. ``It was hoped that the group
getting encainide and flecainide would have less death than the
people who got sugar pills.
   ``It turns out, these two drugs paradoxically, surprisingly,
unexpectedly, had the opposite effect.''
   Use of encainide and flecainide in the CAST trials ended after
an NIH panel discovered that 57 of 730 patients taking the drugs
died of cardiac arrest, while only 22 of 725 patients taking the
placebos died of cardiac arrest.
   Dr. Thomas Bigger, a Columbia University heart researcher who
was chairman of the CAST studies, said the episode with encainide
and flecainide ``is such a startling finding that everybody is
rethinking'' the use of drugs to control irregular heartbeats.
   Encainide, marketed as Enkaid by Bristol-Myers, and flecainide,
sold as Tambocor by 3M Riker, are still being prescribed, but only
for patients who have life-threatening levels of irregular
heartbeat, said Dr. Lawrence Friedman, the NIH director of the CAST
studies.
   The drug companies have sent out revised labeling on what type
of patients should receive the medication.
   ``There certainly is a place for these drugs,'' Friedman said.
``But from our study it is clear that people with mild arrhythmias
should not be treated with these drugs.''

<HEAD>Bush Talking Tough on Steel Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush hopes tough talk will force
foreign governments to stop subsidizing their domestic steel
industries, but lawmakers in U.S. steel states remain skeptical.
   After months of internal debate in his Cabinet, Bush said
Tuesday he was extending steel-import restrictions for 2{ years.
The steel industry had sought a five-year extension.
   The voluntary import quotas, which cover 29 countries, were due
to expire Sept. 30. They will be extended to March 31, 1992, if
Congress, as expected, agrees.
   Bush said the extension would give U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills time to negotiate an end to unfair steel subsidies
provided by other countries.
   If the subsidies aren't removed, foreign producers will be
vulnerable to having unfair trade complaints lodged against them,
which could boost the cost of their products in the United States,
Bush said.
   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., complained that Bush's decision
undercut Hills' negotiating position by fixing a date when the
quotas would end.
   ``The chances are slim to none that even the most determined
U.S. negotiators can end a generation of government subsidizing and
unfair practices in a mere 2{ years,'' he said.
   Under the voluntary restraint agreements, 29 countries,
including Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the 12-nation European
Community, had agreed to limit their imports of steel to 18.4
percent of the U.S. market.
   The quotas were imposed by the Reagan administration in 1984
after an intense campaign waged by steel companies and unions
representing steel workers.
   There was never any question that Bush would support some quota
extension because he had promised to do so in a letter to Heinz
four days before November's presidential election.
   But Bush's advisers were deeply split on the issue, with some
arguing that the U.S. steel industry, which enjoyed profits of $2
billion last year, no longer needed protection.
   Bush's announcement was greeted favorably by steel users, who
praised the president's commitment not to extend the quotas beyond
30 months. The coalition against the quotas ranged from U.S.
automakers to farmers, who must buy farm equipment made from steel.
   Tim Elder of Caterpillar Inc., one of the companies lobbying
hardest against the quotas, said the 2{-year limit was ``the light
at the end of the tunnel for steel consumers.'' After that time, he
said, the market would determine steel availability and prices.
   Bush's action was expected to have little trouble winning
congressional approval.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, whose
committee has jurisdiction over the measure, praised Bush for
striking a ``careful balance'' between producers and consumers.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said the decision was
``in the best interests of our steel companies, our steel users and
American workers and consumers.''
   But Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of
America, said Bush's action fell short of his campaign promise to
Heinz.
   ``Our members have already made deep concessions to help the
industry survive,'' Williams said, ``but we have found the
government to be unwilling to respond to a systematic malaise of
unfair (foreign) steel practices.''
   Howard M. Love, the chairman of National Steel Corp., the
country's sixth-largest steel company, said he was disappointed
with the administration's decision because 30 months was a short
time to try to ``eliminate the unfair and illegal subsidies of
foreign steel producers by their governments.''
   Hills said the administration would try to get the foreign
subsidies eliminated both in country-by-country negotiations and in
the 96-nation trade talks aimed at liberalizing the world trading
system.
   Bush's quota extension will allow the foreign market share to
rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are phased out
entirely. Hills said that yearly increase would be allocated to
countries that exhibit the most willingness to stop subsidizing
their domestic industry.
   When the steel quotas were imposed in 1984, imports accounted
for 26.5 percent of the American market. Last year, that dropped to
20.7 percent.

<HEAD>Order Says Marines Fight Better When They Fight Smarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Marines fight better when they fight smarter,
says the commanding officer, so the order of the day mandates more
reading.
   For sergeants, a book list starts by saying: ``Read a minimum of
two books (ideally four) annually ...'' The mandate for colonels is
three to start, with ``six ideally.''
   The idea to tote books, not just guns, comes from the commandant
of the Marine Corps, Gen. A.M. Gray.
   ``I firmly believe that professional reading is essential to the
professional growth of our leaders,'' Gray said in a recent message
to all Marine barracks. ``The profession of arms, in particular,
has a profound body of knowledge which requires constant study if a
leader is to remain proficient.''
   All of the books on the list give some military lessons, whether
it be leadership qualities from E.B. Hubbard's ``A Message to
Garcia'' or tactics taken from Mao Zedong's ``On Guerrilla
Warfare.''
   The Marines can select from biographies such as ``The Patton
Papers'' or ``The Years of MacArthur.'' Leo Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace'' is on the list, along with Alexander Solzhenitsyn's
``August 1914,'' Von Clausewitz's ``On War'' and Neil Sheehan's
Pulitzer Prize winner, ``A Bright Shining Lie.''
   ``The study of our profession through the selected readings will
assist each Marine's efforts to achieve operational competence and
to better understand the nature of our `calling' as leaders of
Marines,'' Gray said.
   The reading program is part of an overall educational update for
the corps, explained Chief Warrant Officer Eric Carlson, a Marine
Corps spokesman, who added: ``Marines already do a lot of reading
on their own.''
   Carlson said the educational program also calls for setting up
the Marine Corps University at the Combat Development Command at
Quantico, Va., starting Aug. 1. He said the university will act as
an umbrella for the corps' four officers' training schools at
Quantico and ``will provide uniform training.''

<HEAD>Wives Gaining on Husbands, But Still Earn Much Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's wives are bringing home a lot more
of the family bacon than they used to, but still trail their
husbands by a wide margin, the Census Bureau reports.
   Wives earned just 57 percent of what their husbands brought in
as of 1987, although their income had increased nearly twice as
fast as the men's during the decade.
   Between 1981 and 1987, the average earnings of wives rose 23.3
percent, while husbands' income climbed 11.8 percent, according to
the study, ``Earnings of Married-Couple Families: 1987.''
   That brought average income of all wives _ including those not
employed outside the home _ to $13,245 in 1987, compared with
$29,154 for all husbands.
   A major reason for the gain by women was that ``more of them are
working year-round, full time, instead of part time,'' Census
statistician Robert W. Cleveland said Tuesday. In past years, he
said, women were more likely to accept part-time jobs, resulting in
lower average income.
   ``Also, more women are in professional and technical jobs which
tend to have better pay,'' Cleveland said, adding that one factor
in the change is the tendency of women in recent years to pursue
more education.
   ``I think there is more equal treatment, things are not as
discriminatory for women. The opportunities are more available for
them now than in the past,'' Cleveland said.
   Wives working full time at least 50 weeks per year averaged
$18,929 in 1987, only 57 percent of the average $33,005 annual
earnings of husbands who worked full time 50 weeks or more.
   Recent government statistics for all men and women showed women
averaging 65 percent of men's income, somewhat more than the 57
percent for full-time working wives.
   Wives are more likely to have to take time off to tend children,
or to have delayed careers during child rearing, than women in
general.
   Indeed, the effect of children may be noted in the incomes of
wives by age, as reported in the study.
   The most rapid income rise between 1981 and 1987 was among wives
aged 35 to 44, who saw their average jump 31.5 percent, more than
triple the 9.8 percent increase for husbands in the same age group.
   ``In that age bracket, the kids are grown, the women can enter
the labor force and ... start working full time,'' Cleveland said.
   For all wives, those with no children averaged $14,256 in 1987
compared with $13,067 for women with children aged 6 to 17; $12,163
for those with children under age 6 and just $10,732 for those with
children in both age groups.
   Husbands averaged $31,636 for those with children aged 6 to 17;
while those with some under 6 and some 6 to 17 averaged $29,564.
For those with children under 6 average income was $28,181, and it
was $27,755 for husbands without children.
   While husbands may bring home most of the bacon for a majority
of families, that isn't a universal situation.
   About 5.3 million wives earned more than their husbands in 1987,
about 18 percent of the 29.1 million married couples in which both
husband and wife had earnings, the report said.
   In many cases, husbands were 55 or older and often partly
retired, Cleveland said, while their wives tended to be slightly
younger and still working full time. Wives who earned more than
their husbands were more likely than other wives to have attended
college and to have no children at home, the report found.

<HEAD>Third World Debt Hinders U.S. Ag Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The emerging Third World was once viewed
eagerly as one of the American farmer's best hopes of staying in
the export big-time, a foreign market that grew by huge leaps and
showed little sign of slackening.
   But that was before huge debt problems settled on the Third
World. Today, Brazil leads the list with foreign debts totaling
$120 billion, and Mexico is not far behind at $107 billion _ and
there are others.
   ``The debt problem has proved to be highly intractable, and will
probably limit growth in the world economy for years to come,''
says Agriculture Department economist Matthew Shane.
   Estimates indicate that Third World debt has reduced U.S.
agricultural exports by about $3 billion a year since 1982, Shane
said in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine published
by the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Before the debt problem, developing countries were the fastest
growing market for U.S. agricultural exports,'' said Shane, deputy
director of the agency's agricultural trade analysis division.
``During the 1970s, developing countries increased their purchases
of U.S. farm products by nearly 11 percent per year, after
inflation.''
   But in the 1980s, purchases dropped at an annual rate of 4
percent. Even so, the Third World's share of U.S. commodity exports
has risen to more than 40 percent.
   ``The debt problem has constrained imports (of Third World
countries) in two ways,'' he said. ``First, governments' immediate
response to a debt repayment problem is to reduce imports, freeing
foreign exchange earned from exports for additional debt payments.
   ``Second, in the longer term, debt payments compete with
investment for national savings. Reduced investment lowers
long-term economic growth, and thereby shrinks demand for U.S.
agricultural products.''
   Shane said that between 1973 and 1981, U.S. agricultural exports
to countries now considered ``problem'' debtors climbed an average
of 15.4 percent a year.
   But from 1981 through 1987, exports to those countries fell an
average of 10 percent annually.
   Although Brazil and Mexico head the list of debt-burdened farm
customers, other problem debtors include Argentina, Chile, Morocco,
Nigeria and the Philippines.
   A problem country in the context of U.S. agricultural exports
was defined as one with foreign debt over $10 billion and having
repayment problems since 1982.
   ``The share of total agricultural exports going to problem
debtor countries rose to 14 percent in 1980 but has since fallen to
10 percent,'' Shane said. ``Without substantial debt relief, these
countries will become stagnant markets for U.S. farm products.''
   Shane said that in contrast to the debt-burdened countries,
there are ``four tigers'' in East and Southeast Asia _ Hong Kong,
South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan _ that have used expanding export
earnings to increase imports.
   From 1986 to 1988, U.S. agricultural sales to the four increased
54 percent, compared with a 34 percent growth in overall U.S. farm
exports, he said.

   Consumers soon may be enjoying home-grown
cocoa from Puerto Rico instead of relying entirely on foreign
production, according to a team of Agriculture Department
scientists.
   Cocoa, the raw ingredient of chocolate, was tried in the 1940s
as a crop in Puerto Rico but failed because of disease and insect
problems, said agronomist Edmundo Rivera of the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   However, he said in a report Tuesday by the agency, Puerto Rico
has been free of black pod fungus, the disease that threatens
production in other areas. But problems still persist, including
the ability of cocoa crops to tolerate acid soil and resist insect
damage.
   Last year, the United States imported more than $800 million
worth of cocoa beans, powder and cocoa butter _ the nation's entire
supply _ from Brazil, the main exporter, and other producers,
including West Africa, Central America and the Dominican Republic.
   Heber Irizzary, an agency horticulturist, said cocoa can be an
alternative crop that Puerto Rican farmers can grow on steep,
marginal soils or on land once used for sugar cane.
   Cane, once a staple of the island's economy, has become less
profitable because of low yields, higher costs of production and
lower market prices.
   Irizzary and Rivera, who work at the USDA agency's tropical
crops and germplasm research laboratory in Mayaguez, for the past
eight years have been studying cocoa hybrids from many countries to
adapt them to Puerto Rico.
   Experimental trials of cocoa strains from Costa Rica in the
early 1980s last year produced a yield potential of 3,500 pounds to
4,000 pounds per acre from 6-year-old trees, they said. Yields of
2,000 pounds per acre are considered marketable.
   Also, the agency said, cocoa from the test trees has been
evaluated favorably by four of the largest U.S. chocolate
manufacturers.
   Rivera said cocoa would meet the need for crops in Puerto Rico
that are suited to small family operations, since it can be grown
with a minimum amount of tillage and doesn't require expensive
machinery.

   Egg production last month was estimated 5.48
billion, down 2 percent from June 1988, according to the
Agriculture Department.
   Figures released Tuesday by the department's National
Agricultural Statistics Service showed the reduction reflected a
cutback in the number of birds in the U.S. laying flock, which
averaged 266 million in June, also down 2 percent.
   The rate of lay in June was reported at 2,060 eggs per 100 hens,
compared with 2,053 in June 1988.

<HEAD>Capital Gains Squabble Grows As Lawmakers Move 6 Spending Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tax deadlock between Congress and President
Bush is dampening hopes for a 1991 budget deal, but lawmakers are
pushing ahead with six multibillion dollar spending bills for the
coming fiscal year.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Tuesday that Bush's
aggressive campaign to cut the capital gains tax is troubling and
may result in Democrats leaving the president with the task of
proposing how to slash the 1991 federal deficit to $64 billion.
   The budget blueprint for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, calls
for $5.3 billion in new tax receipts.
   To raise most of that money, Bush has been trying to persuade
wavering Democrats on the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee to join Republicans and cut the capital gains tax paid
when property is sold at a profit.
   The administration says a lower rate would stimulate sales of
property, and thus generate money for the government. Democrats say
the cut would mainly put money in the pockets of the rich and cost
the government revenue in the long run.
   Coupled with Bush's continued refusal to raise taxes, the
president's effort is annoying growing numbers of Democrats. Among
the angry lawmakers are some who hope to negotiate a budget deal
for fiscal 1991 in talks later this year, including House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Panetta said it would be hard for him to hammer out a
deficit-cutting agreement with the White House if it's seen as
``purely a political operation that doesn't want to work out a
resolution on substance.''
   On more immediate business, congressional committees approved
six fiscal 1990 spending bills Tuesday. With less than six weeks of
congressional business left until Oct. 1, the House has passed five
of the appropriations bills needed annually to keep the government
functioning, and the Senate has approved none.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved an $18.4 billion
measure for the Treasury, Postal Service and a slew of other
agencies, a $155.2 billion bill for the departments of Health and
Human Services, Labor and Education and a $5.8 billion package for
the departments of commerce, justice, state and the federal
judiciary.
   Across the Capitol, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed
bills containing $44 billion for agriculture programs, $18 billion
for energy and water projects and $10.5 billion for the Interior
Department and for federal cultural programs.
   The Senate Finance Committee also approved adding $60 billion to
the amount the government can borrow, enough to see it through Oct.
31. The $2.8 trillion debt limit is expected to be breached
sometime next month, and lawmakers want to add some leeway before
they leave Aug. 5 for their four-week recess.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis walked off the stage after his
final debate with George Bush and told a top aide, ``I blew it,''
according to a new book about the presidential race.
   Dukakis knew he had committed a serious error by responding
without emotion to a question about the possibility of his wife
being raped and killed, political columnists Jack Germond and Jules
Witcover write in ``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars? The
Trivial Pursuit of the Presidency 1988.''
   Aides were baffled at Dukakis' fumbled answer because the
Massachusetts governor had rehearsed an effective answer to a
soft-on-crime question 13 times during debate preparations.
   Advance copies of the book, published by Warner Books, drew
notice earlier this month for critical comments about Vice
President Dan Quayle attributed to Quayle's campaign aides.
   President Bush said he was offended by Republican advisers,
quoted by Germond and Witcover, who called Quayle a ``lightweight''
and described him as having a childlike immaturity.
   Dukakis' debate response, widely criticized at the time, was to
a question by moderator Bernard Shaw of CNN, who asked if he would
favor the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered.
   Germond and Witcover write that the three other journalists on
the panel were told of Shaw's question in advance and tried
unsuccessfully to talk him into softening it.
   Dukakis' response began: ``No, I don't, Bernard. And I think you
know I've opposed the death penalty all of my life. I don't see any
evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and
more effective ways to deal with violent crime. We've done so in my
own state.''
   Dukakis' answer was flat and bloodless, and it was remembered by
voters because it ``captured the candidate's most glaring
vulnerabilities,'' according to the book.
   The authors say Dukakis walked off the stage in Los Angeles and
told top aide John Sasso, ``I blew it.''
   The book also describes the Bush campaign's successful focus on
a handful of issues used to create negative feelings about Dukakis.
Those issues included Dukakis' veto of a bill requiring students to
say the pledge of allegiance, his support for a law allowing
convicted murderers to be furloughed from prison and opposition to
the death penalty.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
DC-10 airliners are safe, and that there's no need for federal
intervention as a result of last week's crash in Sioux City, Iowa.
   Skinner said Tuesday that he based his decision on the record of
the more than 400 triple-jet DC-10s in service. Its manufacturer,
Douglas Aircraft, says DC-10s have flown 745 million passengers 7
billion miles over two decades.
   However, DC-10s have been in some of history's worst air
disasters, including a 1979 Chicago crash that killed 275 people.
That crash was blamed on a faulty maintenance procedure by American
Airlines.
   Nothing in the plane's record indicates it's either inherently
unsafe or that ``anything needs to be done that hasn't been done,''
Skinner said.
   If evidence is uncovered during the National Transportation
Safety Board's investigation of the July 19 Iowa crash that killed
111 people that indicates a problem, action will be taken, Skinner
said.
   Investigators are focusing on evidence that the tail engine of
the United Airlines DC-10 blew up, disabling its hydraulic steering
system. But they are still trying to determine what caused the
explosive engine failure.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has the power to ground an
airplane, as it did with the DC-10 after the 1979 crash.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole says
partisan differences over a Democratic-backed disaster-relief bill
could scuttle chances of getting quick assistance to farmers who
have lost crops.
   However, Democrats say Dole is exaggerating the dispute over the
$955 million measure, which the Senate Agriculture Committee
approved Tuesday on a party-line vote.
   The legislation costs at least $300 million less than the House
version, but that's $70 million more than President Bush wants to
spend. Republicans say the measure covers too many crops, more than
500.
   ``We've got to find some way to bring (the two sides) together
or there may not be a drought bill,'' said Dole, concerned about
getting help to drought-stricken wheat farmers in his home state of
Kansas.
   Calling the legislation ``a disaster itself,'' Dole said
differences may not be resolved in time to get drought relief to
the president's desk before the August congressional recess.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said the differences between committee
Republicans and Democrats were ``almost indistinguishable.''
   Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., had postponed a vote
last week in the hope of reaching a bipartisan accord. He brought
the bill to a vote Tuesday after it became apparent Republicans
would insist on targeting disaster relief to soybeans and crops in
the government's farm program _ primarily wheat, corn, rice and
cotton.
   Wheat and other crops have been damaged because of the lingering
drought across much of the Great Plains, from Texas to North
Dakota, and flooding has destroyed rice and cotton in the South.
   The Senate Democrats' bill would cover the same crops as the
House legislation, but farmers would have to show a bigger loss to
qualify for disaster relief and the government payments would be
smaller.
   The administration is trying to limit disaster relief to $870
million, but Senate Democrats argue that an additional $85 million
could be made available if some of the payments come from this
year's budget instead of next year's.
   The administration insists all the drought relief come from the
1990 budget.
   Under the committee bill, farmers who grow wheat, corn and other
program crops could qualify for relief if they lost at least 40
percent of the grain. Farmers of other crops would have to show a
45 percent loss to qualify.
   The minimum loss required by the House bill is 35 percent.
   Democrats say that the GOP position that crops in the farm
program should get first crack at drought relief is unfair to
farmers who grow other commodities, discourages farms from
diversifying and makes it politically more difficult to pass the
legislation.
   The debate spilled onto the Senate floor after the committee
vote Tuesday when Dole denounced the Democratic bill.
   ``The American farmer doesn't expect us to shovel out money
every time something happens,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>New Tracking Law Won't Reduce Medical Waste, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most medical waste that washes up on the
nation's beaches comes from illegal drug users and individuals, not
hospitals, according to a new study.
   The Medical Waste Policy Committee said in its report that a
federal law that took effect last month won't do much to reduce the
used needles, syringes and other medical trash plaguing the
nation's shoreline.
   Legislators have said the law will prevent a repeat of last
summer, when waves of medical waste washed up along popular East
Coast beaches.
   ``Laws and regulations specifically aimed at medical waste, such
as the Medical Waste Tracking Act, are unlikely to have a
significant effect on the amount of medical waste found on the
beaches,'' said Richard A. Bernstein, head of General Medical Corp.
and chairman of the committee.
   The problem, Bernstein said, isn't with hospitals but with home
health uses, which account for nearly 1 billion syringes annually.
   The committee, under the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute
of Government at the State University of New York, encouraged
public education programs on proper disposal of used medical items.
   Bernstein presented the results of the six-month study Tuesday
to the House Small Business subcommittee on regulation and business
opportunities.
   Authors of the measure defended it.
   ``There is no reason why medical waste shouldn't be tracked in
the same way other hazardous waste is tracked. That was a hole in
the law,'' said Jason Isaacson, spokesman for Sen. Christopher J.
Dodd, D-Conn., a chief backer of the legislation.
   ``Did it finally resolve all present and future problems with
medical waste? Of course not? Is there room to do more? Of course
there is, but it was a substantial first step,'' Isaacson said.
   Robin Woods, of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the
law would help because it regulates, for the first time, small
health-care providers such as clinics, laboratories and doctors'
offices.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the subcommittee, said the
research ``shows that this country badly needs a clear, uniform
policy that creates incentives for safe, cost-effective management
of this waste.''
   ``One year after needles on our beaches were front-page news,
the bulk of this waste remains largely unregulated and
uncontrolled,'' Wyden said.

<HEAD>Panel Wants Outside Counsel to Review Gingrich Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee wants to hire the
same outside counsel that investigated Speaker Jim Wright to look
into complaints against GOP Whip Newt Gingrich.
   The panel said Tuesday it had asked the House Administration
Committee to hire the Chicago law firm of Phelan, Pope &amp; John Ltd.
at a cost of $150,000.
   Wright resigned from the House last month after the ethics
committee charged him with 69 violations of House rules.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., accused Gingrich in an April
complaint of violating campaign finance laws, House limits on
outside income and a House rule preventing acceptance of gifts from
those with a direct interest in legislation.
   Gingrich, the second-ranking House GOP leader, called
Alexander's charges ``baseless,'' and said ``any serious review of
the allegations would indicate how politically motivated they
were.''
   Alexander's complaint focused on the COS Limited Partnership,
which consisted of 21 investors who contributed $5,000 each to
promote ``Window of Opportunity,'' a book written by the Georgia
Republican, his wife and a third author.
   Gingrich was not an investor, but his wife was paid for running
the partnership, formed in 1984.

<HEAD>Drug Policy Takes Aim at Crack</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William J. Bennett says his national
drug program will focus on the battle against crack.
   ``It's crack that is responsible for the disorder in many of our
cities,'' Bennett said Tuesday, describing the strategy his Office
of National Drug Control must unveil by Sept. 5.
   ``It's crack which is endangering the lives of so many innocent
civilians because of the tendency for violence. It's crack which is
appearing with terrible frequency as the drug sought out by
pregnant addicts.''
   Crack is a cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine that is
smoked.
   While programs focusing on other illegal drugs also are
important, the campaign against crack takes precedence because it
presents ``the clearest, most immediate danger to the largest
number of people,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett also told reporters that states that fail to impose
strict anti-drug policies may risk losing federal funds.
   ``We will expect states to do certain things if they want
federal funds,'' he said. ``We will expect educational institutions
to finally do certain things if they want education funds.''
   He did not give any details.
   A draft of the drug strategy, which Congress has required be
completed by Sept. 5, is being reviewed by the various agencies
affected, including the National Security Council, Bennett said.
   President Bush, who is to announce the program, will have the
final say.
   ``It is his strategy,'' Bennett said.
   Also Tuesday, Bush announced that he will nominate U.S. Marshals
Service Director Stanley E. Morris as deputy director of Bennett's
office in charge of drug supply reduction.
   The long-awaited announcement, following by a week the
nomination of the other top deputy _ Herbert Kleber _ rounds out
the top appointees in the office. The associate director in charge
of state and local affairs, Reggie Walton, was confirmed six weeks
ago.

<HEAD>Bush Plan Favors Rich Less Than Ways and Means-Backed Plan: Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional economists say the capital-gains
tax cut favored by a majority of the House Ways and Means Committee
is tilted more toward high-income Americans than the measure backed
by President Bush.
   Eighty cents of every dollar of benefit in the capital-gains cut
that has become the major issue in the committee would go to those
with incomes above $100,000 a year, according to figures prepared
by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   Bush's proposal would earmark slightly less _ 79.7 cents of
every dollar _ for the over-$100,000 group. But it would give 2.5
percent of the total tax relief to those with incomes under $30,000
a year, compared with 1.8 percent under the bill being debated in
Ways and Means.
   Either plan would cut taxes for about 7.9 million couples and
individuals who would be expected to have profits from the sale of
stocks and other assets in 1990. Capital gains are taxed as
ordinary income, at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent,
depending on total income.
   Bush's proposal, which would result in a top capital-gains rate
of 15 percent, would produce a tax cut of $30,820 for the average
investor with over $200,000 of total income. The other proposal,
which would have a top 20 percent rate for two years and then a 28
percent rate, would be worth $24,906 a year to the average $200,000
investor.
   Bush and other supporters of a capital-gains cut say it would
boost the economy by encouraging saving and reducing U.S. business
costs of investment.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, told reporters Tuesday that any capital-gains cut to
temporarily raise revenue would be gimmickry that would complicate
the future deficit picture.

<HEAD>Company Files Suit Against Comsat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Connecticut company alleges in a $1.5
billion antitrust suit that a congressionally created corporation
is fixing prices and blocking competition for international
satellite communications services.
   Pan American Satellite of Greenwich, Conn., alleges that
Communications Satellite Corp., or Comsat, is blocking ``cheaper
and better satellite communications services in order to line its
own pockets and protect an outmoded monopoly.''
   Comsat sells U.S. companies access to Intelsat, the 117-nation
consortium of satellite telecommunications users.
   PAS Chairman Rene Anselmo said Comsat had ``illegally
monopolized the market by price fixing and conspiring to block
competition. We want to bust open their monopoly.''
   The suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, seeks $500 million in actual damages
_ which would be trebled under U.S. law _ and a permanent
injunction enjoining Comsat from engaging in alleged illegal
activities.
   PAS is the first privately owned international satellite
communications company. It launched its PAS-1 satellite in June
1988 at a cost of about $100 million and began service in September
to Latin America and Europe.
   But PAS alleges that Comsat has tried to put it out of business
by supporting a boycott of separate satellite systems,
misrepresenting facts to PAS customers, using predatory pricing
tactics and conspiring with foreign telecommunications companies to
block PAS business opportunities.
   Comsat spokesman Bob Hunter said the PAS suit ``has absolutely
no merit,'' describing it as another in a ``series of actions taken
by Pan American Satellite to find every opportunity to lodge
complaints and in fact attempt to impede and or harass Comsat in
its own mission.''
   Congress created Comsat in the Communications Satellite Act of
1962. Until 1971, Comsat oversaw Intelsat's growth. Comsat owns 26
percent of Intelsat and accounts for more than 50 percent of all
Intelsat traffic, PAS said.
   Comsat is a private, publicly traded company that leases
Intelsat circuits to companies such as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., MCI, US Sprint and television networks.

<TEXT>
   Human rights activists say their campaign to
abolish the death penalty when this British territory is handed
back to China has a new sense of urgency after Beijing's executions
of pro-democracy protesters.
   ``We certainly are intensifying our efforts,'' said Andrew
Stables, a former chairman of the local Amnesty International
branch.
   Amnesty today submitted a petition to local lawmakers urging the
abolition of capital punishment, saying that events in China had
heightened concern of local residents over the issue.
   ``It doesn't require too much imagination to think of
possibilities'' of abuse of the death penalty in Hong Kong after
1997, when the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty, Stables said.
   Murder and treason are capital crimes under Hong Kong law, but
the colonial governor has commuted all of the more than 230 death
sentences since 1966 _ usually to life imprisonment _ because
executions are not allowed in Britain.
   When Hong Kong is returned to China, laws previously enforced in
the territory will be kept on the books. While capital punishment
may remain, there is no guarantee the automatic commutation of
sentences will continue.
   ``After 1997, we are not sure whether this tradition (of
commutation) can be respected,'' said Rev. Louis Ha, spokesman for
the local Catholic Church, which has long opposed the death penalty.
   What human rights campaigners find particularly worrisome is, in
the words of Stables, the ``fairly liberal use'' of the death
penalty in China.
   Several dozen executions are known to have occurred in China
since the pro-democracy movement was crushed by troops June 3-4,
but Beijing authorities have linked just 12 of those reported to
the protests.
   Many Chinese believe the number is far higher.
   Hong Kong government officials say they have not removed the
death penalty statute because the public supports the law. They
claim there is no evidence that recent executions in China have
swayed local opinion.
   ``So far we haven't seen any change in the mood yet,'' said
Nancy Law, a top official in the government Security Branch,
although acknowledging that no survey has been done.
   Ngai Shiu-kit, a member of the lawmaking Legislative Council,
says he remains a staunch supporter of the death penalty and
believes executions should resume in Hong Kong, where more than 100
people were put to death from 1946-66.
   ``There's an old Chinese saying, `Blood for blood,''' Ngai said.
``We must maintain this severe punishment ... to maintain law and
order.'' He said he believes the death penalty for murder should be
kept after 1997, although he seemed less certain about executions
for treason.
   Other Hong Kong residents may be questioning their earlier
support of the death penalty.
   ``Whatever one's view about morality or the efficacy of the
death penalty, I think it would be naive to believe that Hong Kong
people would not have revised their opinions in the last few
months,'' said Raymond Wacks, head of the Law Department at the
University of Hong Kong.
   Wacks noted that since the bloody Chinese crackdown, Hong Kong
people have been preoccupied with seeking the right to live in
Britain and securing passports to other countries.
   He expressed surprise that there has been little debate about
retaining the death penalty, but believes interest will pick up.
``I suspect this is just one of many issues that will be discussed
in the next few months,'' he said.
   Perhaps the death penalty will generate more interest when the
government unveils later this year a Bill of Rights for Hong Kong,
one of the actions being taken to restore confidence in the colony.
   Stables said Amnesty International will urge that the document
outlaw capital punishment in the territory.

   Rose Douglas' son played with a
yellowish resin near their mobile home and ate vegetables grown
from her garden.
   On Tuesday, the federal government confirmed what she had feared
for most of the 9{ years she'd lived at the Forest Glen trailer
park: The site is heavily polluted with carcinogenic chemical
wastes.
   Like the situation in nearby Love Canal 10 years ago, the
government said the site poses ``a significant risk to human
health.'' It is offering to pay to relocate temporarily some 51
families under a voluntary program.
   Echoing the comments of many of the 150 or so people living on
the 11-acre site, Douglas wants out. But she wants the government
to pay for a permanent move.
   ``If it's that bad that they have to temporarily relocate us,
why not just buy us out?'' she asked.
   A Federal Environmental Protection Agency spokesman, Richard
Salkie, said the contamination is so pervasive he thinks every
resident eventually will have to leave for good.
   ``Any further remedial action could not be performed without
totally disrupting the trailers that might remain,'' he said.
   The trailer park is located just north of a landfill operated by
CECOS International Inc., a hazardous-waste disposal company.
   Toxic wastes and carcinogenic industrial compounds such as
aniline, phenothiazine and benzothiazole have been found in the
soil and ground water at the site. Officials described the
materials as cancer-causing byproducts of chemical production.
   EPA official Joseph Rotola said no evidence exists that Forest
Glen was a recognized landfill at any time, but aerial photos and
the accounts of longtime residents indicate the land was previously
used to bury chemical wastes.
   Before residents can be permanently relocated, the site must be
placed on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List, Salkie
said. He said the EPA will ask the federal Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry to issue a public health advisory,
the first step toward inclusion on the list.
   On Tuesday, that agency released a preliminary assessment that
found ``significant'' health risks in the park.
   Forest Glen is several miles from the Love Canal neighborhood,
which was declared a national environmental disaster in 1978.
   State health officials originally evacuated 237 families whose
homes were built on or adjacent to Love Canal. The state later
offered to buy homes in a 10-block area around the former
Occidental Chemical Corp. dump.
   Salkie refused to identify which of a half-dozen chemical
companies near Forest Glen are being investigated for contaminating
the site, saying officials haven't determined who put what in the
ground.
   Federal officials predicted there would be considerable
resistance to temporary relocation.
   Douglas agreed, saying residents were ``very upset, scared and
very confused'' at being offered only temporary help.
   Douglas said residents are asking: ``Where are they going to put
these people, how long is it going to be and who's going to take
care of our homes while we're gone?
   ``They are our homes. They may be trailers to everybody else who
reads this, but this is our life's savings invested here.''
   Officials had few answers Tuesday. Salkie said it would be
months before a decision was made on the site's fate.
   Douglas said residents have been aware of contaminants for
years, particularly after sewer and power lines were dug into the
site.
   ``We came across yellow resins, an actual clump that when heated
by the sunlight would really smell,'' she said. ``We've thrown
clothes away. My oldest, when he was a baby, played with it like
clay.''

   White House officials aren't saying much about
Felix Bloch, the State Department diplomat being investigated as a
possible spy, but that doesn't mean they aren't thinking about him.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, fielding a question Tuesday
about another matter, said President Bush has repeatedly
``expressed his outrage'' about influence-peddling at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and ``talked to
Secretary Bloch on a number of occasions about remedying the
situation.''
   ``Secretary Kemp, I'm sorry,'' Fitzwater quickly added, this
time getting the name of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp right.
   Later, Fitzwater said he didn't know about reports that the
United States had warned the Soviets not to spirit Bloch out of the
country.
   ``As near as I can tell, the entire FBI and the Soviet Embassy
is living with the guy,'' Fitzwater quipped. ``I don't think he's

   The Energy Department is suspending commercial
shipments of tritium from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee because European customers have complained of short
weights.
   The department said Tuesday that measurement and loading
operations are being reviewed.
   Tritium, a radioactive gas, is a major component of many nuclear
weapons, but it also has commercial, research and medical uses.
Tritium is used in luminous signs, such as aircraft exit signs, and
for runway markers in remote areas such as Alaska.
   The department's production of tritium is shut down because of
safety and management problems with the nuclear reactors used to
produce it at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

   Congressional efforts to force communities
into cleanups they can't afford won't work and are a cheap
substitute for a real environmental policy, a representative of the
National League of Cities said.
   ``You cannot build ... treatment plants with a thousand points
of light,'' John Bullard said Tuesday before a joint session of the
Environment and Public Works subcommittees on environmental
protection and on superfund, ocean and water protection.
   Bullard, mayor of New Bedford, Mass., represented the National
League of Cities before the subcommittees, which are considering a
variety of clean water legislation.
   Bullard said the federal government must be able to ``walk this
fine line'' between ``punishment and partnership'' if it is to be
serious about environmental issues.
   An ``irresistible force'' of public demand for a clean
environment is running up against an ``immovable object'' of scarce
financial resources that threatens ``an impending explosion that
could consume some cities,'' he said.

   A survivor of United Flight 232 praised
the flight attendants for maintaining calm and helping passengers
escape from the wreckage of the DC-10 after it crashed.
   Helen Hayes of Denver said a flight attendant whose name she
doesn't know helped prevent panic. Ms. Hayes was sitting in the
ninth row in the jetliner's middle cabin section.
   ``Her voice was very soothing,'' Ms. Hayes, 27, said Tuesday
from her Sioux City hospital room. ``She prevented the passengers
from going into complete hysteria.''
   Seven of the eight flight attendants on the plane survived the
tumbling crash at the Sioux Gateway Airport last Wednesday. Of the
296 people aboard, 185 survived and 111 perished.
   United spokesmen said they would wait for investigators to
determine why such a high number of the cabin crew survived. United
spokesman Rob Doughty said flight attendants sit in jump seats
which are bolted to bulkheads in reinforced sections of the cabin.
   That's so they can help passengers get out of the airplane, he
said.
   Ms. Hayes said she could see the fear on the flight attendant's
face. She said flight attendants issued instructions on what
passengers should do right up to the time the crippled jumbo jet
hit the ground.
   ``It must have been very difficult for them to do that,'' she
said.
   Ms. Hayes said passengers were calm but tense before the crash.
   ``People were very quiet, you could feel the fear in the air,''
she said. ``People were very tense.''

   Re-enactments of real-life events, once
limited to racy, crime-stopping television shows like ``America's
Most Wanted,'' have arrived on network news, startling some eminent
broadcast journalists.
   By showing a brief re-enactment Friday, ABC's ``World News
Tonight'' has drawn criticism even from some staffers.
   ``We were wrong with what we did,'' Sam Donaldson, a veteran ABC
correspondent, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   ABC anchorman Peter Jennings apologized in his Tuesday newscast
for the network's failure to identify the segment as a simulation.
   The controversy was sparked by an ABC News report using two
staged images to intimate that veteran U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch
had handed a briefcase to a Soviet agent.
   Bloch has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
   Donaldson said ABC's depiction of the alleged transaction easily
could have led viewers to ``believing that they had actually seen
the event. And ... they might say, `Well, I saw the dirty
sonofabitch pass the briefcase ... to a dirty Commie spy....' Well,
no, they didn't. They didn't see that at all.''
   Fred Friendly, a former CBS News president, said: ``This fooled
everybody. A friend of mine looked at (ABC's Bloch story), and said
he had no idea it was a simulation.''
   In the version of ``World News Tonight'' seen by most of its
nearly 20 million viewers, the 10-second re-created scene was not
labeled as staged.
   Richard Wald, senior vice president of ABC News, defended the
network's use of the re-enactment earlier this week. He did say the
network made ``a terrible mistake'' in failing to label them
consistently as simulations.
   But other news officials said ABC's mistake wasn't just its
failure to describe the segment as fabricated, but its decision to
use a news re-creation in the first place.
   ``I think it's very dangerous. I think it was particularly
unfortunate that they tried to fake the look of an FBI surveillance
film,'' said Lawrence Grossman, a former NBC News president. ``I
just don't think the news divisions should be in the business of
creating fiction, or fiction based on fact.
   ``The (broadcasting) techniques are beginning to overwhelm the
old standards.''
   Ed Turner, executive vice president of the Cable News Network,
said that CNN doesn't do ``theater in the round. We don't do drama
with actors.''
   Said Turner: ``There's enough real drama that we don't have to
re-create it. ... It is the function of the reporter on the story
to tell the tale, to relate the events in narrative fashion, rather
than to use some form of dramatic re-enactment to try to sustain
viewer interest.''
   Yet sustaining viewer interest, especially in a tightly
competitive television environment, has become crucial.
   NBC News' ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' will use two news
re-creations when the show debuts Aug. 2, and news simulations are
among the options being weighed for CBS News' ``West 57th,'' which
will be redesigned for the fall with Connie Chung as host.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner said Tuesday that
``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow,'' a prime-time news-oriented
program, will use re-enactments only ``when there is no existing
video or film footage of the events.''
   Gartner said he ``cannot conceive of an example where we would
use re-creations or simulations on `NBC Nightly News.'''
   ``It's not television journalism,'' Friendly said. ``It's
television carnival. ... There are people who have dedicated their
lives to the concept that what you see on the air or hear on the
radio is what happened, not what got simulated.''
   Grossman said NBC's ``Today'' show has already started
manipulating stories without other broadcast technologies, adding
``mood music'' to some news reports for added emotional appeal.
   ``When you start mucking up reality, even though it may be
justified in a particular instance, it really creates a very
dangerous pattern,'' Grossman said.
   Defenders of re-enactments liken them to artists' courtroom
sketches and animated simulations of lunar landings.
   But as Donaldson pointed out in the case of the ABC simulation
about Bloch, people ``weren't watching an artist who did see it,
who said, `I was there.'''
   Ernie Leiser, the former executive producer of Walter Cronkite's
newscast, said much depends on how re-enactments are used.
   ``If it is made clear that it is a simulation, and if it's done
because you don't have pictures, and it clarifies the story you're
trying to tell, I see nothing wrong with it in principle,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Dismisses Two Charges Against Poindexter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter no longer faces theft and wire fraud charges in the
Iran-Contra case.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene ordered permanent dismissal of
the charges Tuesday, also outlining the procedure prosecutors could
use to narrow a broad conspiracy charge against Poindexter.
   If prosecutors file a motion, Greene said he ``will strike from
the indictment'' portions of the charges they want to eliminate.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh wants to reduce the scope of
the case against Poindexter, who faces trial later this year, to
avoid problems involving classified information. Such problems
plagued the Iran-Contra case against Oliver North.
   In the North case, prosecutors ultimately had to abandon the
entire conspiracy charge against the former White House aide to
protect national secrets and save the remainder of the criminal
case.
   Prosecutors in the Poindexter case want to cut the portions of
the indictment dealing with the diversion to the Contras of
proceeds from arms sales to Iran.
   The remainder of the conspiracy charge accuses Poindexter of
obstructing inquiries by Congress and making false and misleading
statements to government agencies. His alleged conspirators were
North, retired Air Force Major Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-born
businessman Albert Hakim.
   Poindexter also is accused of obstructing a congressional
inquiry into secret Contra resupply operations and obstructing
Congress in connection with a false chronology about a shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran. In addition, he faces two charges of making
false statements to Congress about the shipment of Hawk missiles.

<HEAD>Walesa Refuses Role In Governing Coalition, Says He'll Form Own Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After rejecting President Wojciech
Jaruzelski's offer to join a governing coalition, Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa said he intends to form a shadow Cabinet and prepare
for ``inevitable'' control of the government.
   He said he told Poland's Communist chief during a two-hour
meeting Tuesday that the ``bold solution'' to Poland's leadership
crisis would be for the ruling Communists to let the free trade
union movement govern.
   Solidarity-backed candidates won all but one of the seats they
were allowed to contest in June parliamentary elections.
   Walesa said ``everything indicates'' the Communists are still
unwilling to surrender power to the popular movement they tried to
crush in December 1981 with martial law.
   ``For my part, I intend to form a shadow Cabinet to prepare for
the solution that sooner or later will become inevitable,'' he said
in making public a statement he gave Jaruzelski.
   Walesa said his private talks with Gen. Jaruzelski were ``very
interesting'' but did not produce any agreement.
   He said Jaruzelski, who has led the country for eight years as
Communist Party first secretary and was elected by parliament last
week to the newly powerful presidency, has not yet decided what
government to nominate.
   Walesa said he would not stand in the way of Solidarity members
accepting appointments as government ministers, but that they would
be acting as individuals.
   He told reporters the union fears it would not have enough
strength within a governing coalition to force through its own
policies, but would be held accountable by the public for
government decisions anyway.
   ``We are remaining an opposition that will ensure that the
government does not leave the path of reforms,'' Walesa told a
brief news conference.
   He added: ``It will be more comfortable for us in the opposition
because we will focus on making sure that the path of reforms is
kept, and not on other things for which we are not yet mature.''
   Tuesday was not the first time Communist authorities had asked
Solidarity to join a governing coalition.
   The government negotiated Solidarity's April reinstatement, many
believe, because it desperately needs to cooperation of the
opposition if it is to revive the country's crippled economy.
   Inflation is running at 160 percent and Poles are beset by
worsening shortages of food and other consumer goods.
   In June, Solidarity won 99 out 100 seats in the freely elected
Senate but was allowed under the April accords to contest just 35
percent of the 460 seats in parliament's more powerful lower house,
the Sejm.
   Walesa referred to Solidarity's electoral victory when asking
for control of the government.
   ``The continuously deteriorating economic situation ... and
growing social tensions make necessary bold and decisive solutions
concerning the formula of exercising power.
   ``The only reasonable decision would be to hand over the
government to those forces which enjoy the support of the majority
of society,'' his statement to Jaruzelski said.
   ``Only such a bold solution would have a chance of convincing
society of the irreversible nature of the changes and the necessity
for quick and thorough economic reforms which inevitably carry
costs,'' he said.
   Solidarity lawmakers were to meet today to discuss the next
government.
   Parliament elected Jaruzelski president last week with the bare
minimum number of votes required, thanks to the tacit support of
some Solidarity lawmakers who deliberately absented themselves from
the balloting.
   As president, he is required to nominate a prime minister to
assemble the next government subject to parliamentary approval.
   Jaruzelski has said the government should be formed as quickly
as possible.

<HEAD>Cuba Rejects U.S. Charges That It's Soft on Drug Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMAGUEY, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba has a better record than the United
States of punishing narcotics smugglers, the country's deputy
foreign minister said in response to U.S. charges that his
government is soft on drugs.
   The diplomat, Ricardo Alarcon, told a news conference Tuesday
that while U.S. officials accused of narcotics trafficking go
unpunished, Cuba has acted decisively against officials guilty of
the same crimes.
   Two weeks ago, Cuban authorities executed Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and
three colleagues after a court-martial found them guilty of drug
smuggling and other charges.
   Alarcon said U.S. authorities refused to act on information
several years ago suggesting that high-level American officials
were involved in cocaine trafficking from Central America to
Florida. He said former National Security aide Oliver North was
among those involved.
   U.S. officials have said those allegations have little
credibility partly because they were based largely on comments made
years ago by convicted drug smugglers.
   American skeptcism of Cuba's commitment to fighting the drug
trade was reaffirmed Tuesday during a House hearing in Washington.
   Melvyn Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said there was a sharp increase in drug
shipments through Cuban territory in the first six months of this
year.
   ``Some evidence suggests that Cuba simultaneously facilitates
the flow of drugs in selected cases while prosecuting other cases
to conviction,'' Levitsky told the House Foreign Affairs Committee
narcotics task force.
   Alarcon said Cuba will not ``tolerate the least flexbility, the
slightest concession toward this vice nor toward any person related
to this vice.''
   He also said that ``tons and tons'' of marijuana packages have
washed ashore in Cuba over the years, indicating that American
traffickers were responsible.
   Given the magnitude of the overall drug problem, Alarcon said
both countries could benefit from a cooperative effort in combating
drug trafficking.
   Alarcon spoke to reporters on the eve of tonight's speech by
President Fidel Castro marking the 36th anniversary of his first
armed attack against the military dictatorship he ousted in 1959.
   Hours after Alarcon spoke, an official of the Department of
Revolutionary Orientation, Jorge Gomez Barata, protested Bush
administration plans to beam television broadcasts to Cuba.
   He said Cuba has the technology to jam the broadcasts.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Wednesday,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended lower after
morning gains.
   The dollar closed at 141.43 yen, down 0.92 yen from the previous
day's 142.35-yen finish. It opened at 141.50 yen and moved between
141.33 yen and 141.58 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 23.07
points, or 0.07 percent, ending the day at 34,515.83. The index had
gained 445.57 points Tuesday, reaching a record high of 34,538.90,
and gained another 159.69 points Wednesday morning before turning
down.
   Dealers said stock buying by investment trust companies pushed
the index up in the morning, then investors began selling to take
profits after gains for five consecutive trading days.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's movement followed trends in
New York and European markets, falling because of expectations that
the second quarter U.S. gross national product figure, to be
announced Thursday, would show little economic growth, traders said.
   Such an indication usually discourages foreign investors from
buying dollars because of the possibility it might lead to interest
rate cuts.
   Securities firms and investment trust companies bought dollars
for U.S. bonds to be issued in early August, said one dealer with a
commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other traders said investors still were reluctant to buy the yen
due to Japan's political uncertainties.

   Two PTL aides convicted of tax evasion
harbored no bitterness over ministry founder Jim Bakker's decision
not to testify in their defense, their attorney says.
   Brothers David and James Taggart were convicted Tuesday of
evading $525,000 in income taxes on $1.2 million they took from the
television ministry to buy condominiums, furs, jewelry and nearly
$100,000 worth of shoes.
   Bakker invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination last week when the defense called him to the
stand. Bakker and former PTL Executive Vice President Richard
Dortch are scheduled to go on trial Aug. 28 on wire and mail fraud
and conspiracy charges.
   ``Obviously we would have preferred it if he testified,'' said
defense attorney Ben Cotten.
   He said his clients were not bitter at their former boss.
   ``They recognized he followed his constitutional rights, just
like we have,'' Cotten said. ``He's going to face some of the same
things we faced in this trial.''
   Federal prosecutor David Brown said he would recommend a stiff
sentence. Each Taggart faces a maximum of 25 years in prison and
more than $1 million in fines. A tentative sentencing date was set
for Aug. 25.
   ``Greed doesn't pay. No matter how rich you are, you've got to
pay your taxes,'' Brown said.
   A U.S. District Court jury found David Taggart, 32, and his
35-year-old brother, James, guilty on identical charges: conspiracy
to impede the IRS in collecting income taxes and filing false tax
returns for the years 1984 through 1987.
   Brown said the verdict was not a statement about PTL, the
televangelism empire started by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker in the
early 1970s. The ministry was well known for the Bakkers' tearful,
televised pleas for money.
   ``It was a statement about David Taggart and James Taggart's
obligations to pay their taxes no matter how much they own and what
kind of lifestyle they live,'' he said.
   The Taggarts joined PTL in 1978 as piano players. By 1980, David
was Bakker's top personal aide. James became the interior designer
at PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat just south of Charlotte.
   Both Taggarts were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at PTL in
early 1987 following Bakker's resignation.
   The Taggarts were charged with tax evasion after they allegedly
spent nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personal luxuries such as
condominiums _ including one at Trump Tower in New York City,
jewelry and designer clothes.
   Cotten said the money was approved by Bakker.
   Brown said the Taggarts used their credit cards to make the
purchases and over four years took out about $750,000 in cash from
PTL to pay off the bills.
   The Taggarts declined to comment following the verdict.
   Cotten still maintained his clients were innocent.
   ``They were innocent going in and they are innocent coming
out,'' he said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Bakkers' home in
Orlando, Fla., said there would be no comment from the Bakkers. She
declined to give her name.
   Bakker and Dortch were indicted Dec. 5 on charges they diverted
more than $4 million to support lavish lifestyles. If convicted on
all charges, each man could be sentenced to more than 120 years in
prison and fined more than $5 million.
   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal brought
on by his confession of a sexual liaison with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.

<HEAD>Student Wins Legal Fight Over Dissecting Animals In Biology Class</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high school biology student who refused
to dissect animals claimed vindication when officials agreed to
recalculate her failing grade, but she said her religious beliefs
still cause problems at school.
   School officials agreed to honor Maggie McCool's beliefs and
recalculate her biology grade of a D on Tuesday, hours before an
administrative law judge was to begin a trial on the girl's lawsuit.
   ``I learned that it's worth it, in the end, to act on your
convictions,'' the slight, soft-spoken 16-year-old said.
   Miss McCool had charged that the Woodstown-Pilesgrove Board of
Education violated her freedom of religion by giving her failing
grades for refusing to dissect frogs, worms or a fetal pig in her
10th-grade biology class last year.
   Board attorney Michael Jordan said the district decided to
settle because Miss McCool probably would have proved at trial that
her refusal to cut up dead animals stemmed from sincere religious
beliefs. The district also agreed to pay $12,500 in legal fees,
which will go to the American Civil Liberties Union.
   A federal judge dismissed a similar lawsuit one year ago in
California when high school officials agreed to let the student, a
vegetarian, use photographs of a frog that was killed by natural
causes.
   Miss McCool said her battle has not been without its trials, and
many classmates have ostracized her because they think her
convictions are ``weird.''
   She recounted one incident when a classmate spotted a mouse
running across steps outside the school. When he saw Miss McCool
was only a few feet away, he ran over and stomped the rodent to
death.
   ``The fact that he took a life to torment me was very
upsetting,'' she said.
   Jordan said it was unclear early in the case when Miss McCool
first informed her adviser she would not dissect animals and that
her objections were grounded in religious convictions.
   ``We thought we were dealing with a curriculum dispute,'' he
said.
   But a lawyer for the girl maintained from the beginning that her
spiritual doctrine bars her from harming animals.
   ``They should have known, absolutely. If they had asked Maggie
the question, she would have answered it _ that it was a religious
belief,'' said E. Elizabeth Sweetser, her lawyer.
   Jordan said that on the eve of the trial, the board voted
unanimously to settle the legal fight.
   Miss McCool, who will enter the 11th grade at Woodstown High
School this year, said she refuses to wear leather or wool or drink
milk. She also shuns makeup, which is often tested on animals.
   She likens many of her beliefs to those followed in Jainism, an
ancient Hindu religion that emphasizes asceticism and reverence for
living things, although she does not consider herself a member of
the religion.
   Her household has been vegetarian since she was a small child.
The rest of the family does not adhere to as strict a system of
beliefs, but her father, Joseph McCool, said he and the other
family members believe in a doctrine of ``harmlessness.''
   Jordan said that in future cases, the board will accommodate
other students who refuse to dissect or observe dead animals based
on religious beliefs. But little deference will be given to
students who refuse just because they're squeamish.
   ``If a kid says they don't feel like touching dead worms and
fetal pigs, they're going to have to learn to deal with dead worms
and fetal pigs. There are very few people who have lived the kind
of life Miss McCool has lived, and we feel this is a sincere
religious belief,'' Jordan said.
   Even with the recalculation, Miss McCool figures her D grade
will only be boosted to a C.
   ``Science is not her strong suit,'' Ms. Sweetser said.

   Fourteen Indian peacekeeping soldiers
were killed and three injured when Tamil rebels detonated
remote-controlled explosives in northeastern Sri Lanka, military
officials said today.
   The Indian soldiers were travelling in a truck when the
explosion occured Tuesday at Mullipothnai, about 160 miles
northeast of Colombo, the Sri Lankan officials said.
   Indian diplomats said they had no immediate information on the
report.
   The Sri Lankan military officials said 17 Indian soldiers were
in the truck when explosives, buried in the road, were detonated.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
blamed the attack on the dominant Tamil rebel group, the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   Tamil rebels started a violent campaign in 1983 to carve out a
separate homeland, claiming their ethnic minority was being
discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils form 18 percent of the island's 16 million people, while
Sinhalese make up 75 percent and dominate the government and
military.
   Neighboring India sent a peacekeeping force to Sri Lanka nearly
two years ago to disarm Tamil guerrillas and oversee a peace
accord. But the Tamil Tigers refused to surrender their weapons.
   India got involved in the conflict because it is the dominant
power in the region and because of the sympathies of its own 60
million Tamils.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has demanded that the India
withdraw its troops by the end of July, but Indian says a premature
pullout would lead to even more violence. About 15,000 people,
including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed in the past six
years of ethnic violence.
   Work in almost all state and commercial banks and some
government and private offices in Colombo came to a standstill
today as workers heeded a call by the Workers Action Front for a
three-day protest against the Indian presence.
   The front, a shadowy group whose orders are issued through wall
posters and leaflets, organized the transport strike that crippled
most of the country from mid-June to mid-July.
   Sri Lankan military officers say the Workers Action Front is
linked to a Sinhalese extremist group, the People's Liberation
Front, which accuses the government of making too many concessions
to Tamils and not being firm enough in getting rid of the Indian
soldiers.
   The government blames Sinhalese extremists for 4,000 political
killings in the past two years, including 3,000 since Premadasa
took office as president in January. Most of the victims were
Sinhalese government officials or supporters.
   Fourteen people, including three soldiers and two policemen,
were killed by Sinhalese extremists Tuesday and early Wednesday in
the Sinhalese heartland of southern and central Sri Lanka,
officials said.

   Federal Judge Alcee Hastings, fighting
impeachment charges before a Senate panel, already has convinced
one panel member that wiretap charges are too weak to warrant
removing him from the bench.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., surprised his fellow panel members
Tuesday when he said that even if the wiretap evidence were viewed
in the most damaging way, it would be too weak to warrant removing
Hastings from the U.S. District Court bench in Florida.
   Hastings testified before the panel Tuesday that he never leaked
wiretap information to the mayor of Dade County, Fla., and was not
offered money to fix a case.
   ``I did not tell Mayor (Steve) Clark anything about anything,
anytime on earth,'' Hastings said, appearing as a witness before
the 12-member panel hearing evidence in the case. ``I take great
stock in my ability to keep a secret.''
   The wiretap charges contend that Hastings compromised three FBI
investigations by leaking wiretap information over which he had
jurisdiction.
   Hastings, 52, also is accused of plotting with Washington
attorney William Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff.
   The panel is hearing evidence to report to the full Senate,
which will decide whether to remove Hastings, who is paid $89,500 a
year.
   Gorton told fellow lawmakers his conclusion did not apply to the
other articles of impeachment against Hastings approved by the
House a year ago. No other lawmakers joined in his statement.
   ``Sen. Gorton, as he said, was speaking for himself,'' Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told reporters, adding that he preferred to
wait until all the evidence was presented to decide.
   Hastings is expected to return to the witness chair later to
testify on the bribery allegations.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., however, asked the judge Tuesday if
money to fix a case had ever been offered by Borders, once an
influential figure in Washington who was convicted of bribery
conspiracy in 1983 and now is refusing to answer questions before
the panel.
   ``None whatsoever,'' Hastings replied.
   Hastings told the panel that when he was confronted by two Miami
reporters concerning rumors that he had disclosed the wiretap
information ``I was absolutely livid in the way this information
was coming to me.''
   ``It was rife in the courthouse and it was bouncing all over the
place,'' Hastings said. ``It is hard for me to control my rage as I
speak now.''
   He acknowledged under questioning from lawmakers that he did not
cooperate at first with the Justice Department's investigation of
the wiretap leak.
   He said that was because he felt officials treated him unfairly
in connection with the bribery conspiracy case and that he thought
they were likely to do so again.

   A Jamaican drug dealer nicknamed ``Uzi'' who
helped introduce crack into the city was convicted of killing six
people and injuring more than a dozen others to further his empire.
   Delroy ``Uzi'' Edwards, a 30-year-old illegal alien from
Jamaica, glowered at the jury in federal court in Brooklyn Tuesday
as the foreman announced guilty verdicts to all 42 charges against
him.
   The panel expressed concern for their safety before delivering
their verdict. U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie ordered
marshals to escort jurors from the courthouse and assured them
their names would not be revealed.
   Edwards was convicted of participating in four murders in
Brooklyn and one each in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore to get rid
of rival drug dealers and maintain discipline in his own ranks.
   He also was found guilty of 17 assaults, one maiming, kidnapping
and weapons charges and running a continuing criminal enterprise.
   The murder victims included four of Edwards' employees, a rival
drug dealer and an innocent bystander. They occurred during a
12-month period ending in December 1987.
   ``I assume he's going to appeal. Other than that I have no
comment,'' said Edwards' court-appointed lawyer, David Gordon. He
faces several life sentences on the convictions.
   Edwards also faces a state murder charge for a July 4, 1987,
slaying in a Brooklyn discotheque. Edwards, who has been in jail
since he was arrested on the murder charge in March 1988, was
returned to his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
Manhattan.
   During the six-week trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonny J.
Frank described the brutal methods of the 50-member gang of
Jamaicans headed by Edwards that sold marijuana, crack and cocaine
in New York and later extended its operations to Washington,
Philadelphia and Baltimore.
   In an indictment handed up last December and in the
prosecution's presentation to the jury, the government told of a
drug operation that brought in up to $100,000 a day.
   Innocent bystanders were not immune to the rage of a man known
on the street as ``Uzi'' because he frequently carried one of the
small machine guns under his trench coat.
   Some of Edwards' victims were ``people who happened to be at the
wrong place at the wrong time,'' Frank said.
   Those who testified included Edward's second-in-command, a
30-year-old murderer and drug dealer named Kenneth Manning,
described to the jury how he participated in the grotesque
Edwards-ordered murder of an errant co-worker, ``Egghead,'' who was
beaten with bats and then doused with boiling water.
   Prosecutors said Edwards made ``mountains of money'' after
introducing crack, the powerful cocaine-based drug, in a poor
Brooklyn neighborhood in 1985.
   He owned luxury cars, real estate, fancy clothes and once paid
$150,000 in $10 and $20 bills to purchase a home in Amityville,
they said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules INS Improperly Dismissed Asylum Applications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYLER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that immigration
officials acted improperly in denying political asylum to six
Salvadorans, casting doubt on the method used to curb the influx of
Central American refugees.
   Regulations require the Immigration and Naturalization Service
to adjudicate requests for work authorization from any alien who as
filed an application for asylum that is ``non-frivolous.''
   But in a ruling that suggests that the INS has been dismissing
asylum applications as frivolous without fully considering their
merits, U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice ordered the
agency to readjudicate work authorization requests for six
Salvadorans.
   The ruling, signed Friday but only released to lawyers in the
case Monday, also ordered the INS to consider a work authorization
request from a seventh Salvadoran.
   The ruling is particularly significant in south Texas, where the
INS detains refugees and considers most applications frivolous,
according to Robert Rubin, a San Francisco lawyer who represents
the Salvadorans.
   ``The INS sees the denial of work authorizations as a means to
discourage persons from pursuing their asylum claims,'' Rubin
claimed Tuesday.
   The New York Times today quoted Rubin as saying he had already
filed a petition to make the judge's ruling apply to all asylum
applicants in Texas.
   The newspaper also said government lawyers arguing the case had
told the judge the country would face a ``flood of illegal aliens''
if the policy for considering work authorization requests was
struck down.
   ``The ruling relaxes the burden of proof placed on the alien
seeking asylum and it imposes a new standard for determining
whether an asylum application should receive work authorization,''
James Reynolds, counsel for the Dallas INS office, told the Times.
   The agency was reviewing the decision and hasn't decided yet
whether to appeal, he said.
   Immigration attorneys have accused the INS of denying
applications for political asylum by improperly assuming that
refugees seek it only for economic reasons.
   A report issued Tuesday by an American Bar Association committee
said the INS is unjustly denying people the opportunity to apply
for asylum.
   The Texas ruling went against U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, whose office represented the INS in the case.
   ``From the evidence adduced to date, it appears that the
defendant misapplies its interpretation of the term frivolous with
respect to its review of both the factual allegations and legal
theories underlying claims for asylum,'' wrote Justice.
   ``The inability to work for the extended period during which the
asylum application is considered by the INS and federal courts may
compel an applicant to abandon his or her asylum application and
return to his or her native country,'' he wrote.
   ``Not only would this deprive the applicant of the opportunity
to urge his or her application through the entire review process,
but would, in substantial likelihood, subject the applicant to even
more persecution upon return to the country that he or she has
attempted to flee.''

<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A landslide triggered by torrential rains
buried a small village in the western state of Maharashtra and all
37 inhabitants were feared dead, police said today.
   The landslide, which occurred Monday in Bhaji village, was set
off by a fierce storm that has been blamed for at least 455 deaths
this week.
   The casualties are believed to be the highest during the monsoon
in recent years, authorities said. The Press Trust of India news
agency estimated the damage to crops and livestock in the millions
of dollars.
   Bhaji is about 165 miles southeast of the state capital, Bombay.
   Large boulders and tons of mud crashed down on houses built on
the hill during the storm, said a police official in Pune, the
closest town to Bhaji.
   ``It is highly unlikely that survivors will be found,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers were working to remove the debris but little progress
has been made because the boulders were very heavy, he said.
   At least 315 people have died in Maharashtra during three days
of incessant rain that set off landslides and flash floods and
uprooted trees and houses, authorities said.
   Elsewhere in India, at least 140 people died in the storm that
originated in the Bay of Bengal and traveled across the country to
the western coast.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers considering a challenge to Georgia's
156-year-old anti-sodomy law said a man's prison sentence for
having sex with his wife shows the statute could be abused in
bitter divorce fights.
   James Moseley, a 34-year-old carpenter, was convicted of one
sodomy charge after admitting on the witness stand that he engaged
in oral sex with his common-law wife of four years, Bette Roberts.
   Sodomy is a felony in Georgia, even if the parties are
consenting husband and wife.
   Moseley was charged with two counts of rape, two counts of
aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated anal sodomy
stemming from two February 1988 encounters with Ms. Roberts.
   In May 1988, a jury acquitted Moseley of five of the six
charges, but convicted him of one sodomy charge because of his
admission on the stand. Moseley was sentenced to five years in
prison. The couple is divorced.
   The American Civil Liberties Union is considering asking the
state Court of Appeals to accept a late appeal on Moseley's behalf
or filing a habeas corpus action directly challenging his
incarceration, said Judd Herndon, an ACLU attorney.
   ``Heterosexuals today do not perceive themselves to be at risk
(under the sodomy law). ... They felt themselves immune. Mr.
Moseley has rudely found out that husbands and wives are not
immune,'' Herndon said.
   ``The Georgia sodomy law now becomes a weapon that can be used
by feuding spouses in a divorce action, and that ought to scare
every husband and wife in this state.''
   There are sodomy laws in 25 states, and seven of those apply the
law only to relations between homosexuals, according to the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   Steven Lister, Moseley's lawyer at the trial, said he had no
idea Moseley's confession would be used against him.
   Superior Court Judge William H. Ison told the jurors that they
had the option of finding Moseley guilty of the lesser crime of
simple sodomy.
   State Rep. Charles Thomas, chairman of the Georgia House
Judiciary Committee, said he doubts lawmakers will attempt to
change the sodomy law in 1990 unless the courts tell them to do so.
   Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers said Tuesday his office
isn't involved in the case yet and declined to say what stand he
would take on an appeal.
   He also noted that the state argued in an earlier case involving
homosexuals that the sodomy law could not be applied to consensual
acts within a heterosexual marriage.
   In the earlier case, Michael Hardwick of Atlanta was arrested
for engaging in oral sex with another man.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in 1985 that
the law violated Hardwick's right to privacy. On appeal, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in 1986 that the Constitution does not
protect homosexual relations between consenting adults, even in the
privacy of their homes.

<HEAD>Shares Fall From Record High; Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index declined today
from its record high, and the dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 34,515.83, down
23.07 points, or 0.07 percent, from the record high of 34,538.90 it
reached Tuesday with a gain of 445.57 points.
   ``The index was higher in morning trading as investors were
reassured by the yen's strength against the dollar,'' Nomura
Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said.
   But in the afternoon, investors were selling to take profits
after five days of gains, he said. He added that uncertainties over
U.S. second quarter gross national product figures to be released
Thursday contributed to the index's decline.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 1
billion shares, unchanged from the previous day.
   Housing-related issues gained after a news report that the Labor
Ministry would reduce income taxes related to rents, Inoue said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 141.43 yen, down 0.92
yen from the previous day's 142.35-yen finish. It opened at 141.50
yen and moved between 141.33 yen and 141.58 yen.
   Minori Takeuchi, a Chemical Bank dealer, said, ``Although many
investors were inclined to sell the dollar, they bought it back
whenever the rate went down near the 141-yen line.''
   Ms. Takeuchi said the market was awaiting the U.S. GNP figures
as an important indicator od whether the United States would relax
its monetary policy. Lower U.S. interest rates make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.

   Scattered thunderstorms today lingered in the lower Mississippi
Valley and southeast Texas, and fog covered much of the Northeast.
   On Tuesday, storm winds blew down trees and power lines in
southern Atlantic Coast states.
   In several northern Georgia communities, wind felled trees,
including two that landed on an automobile in Marietta, north of
Atlanta. The thunderstorms brought large hail to the area.
   Winds also toppled trees and power lines in Asheville, N.C.
   A small tornado moved through Beaumont, Texas, on Tuesday, but
it did little damage. One large building lost its tin roof.
   A cold front moving across the northern Plains and central
Rockies dropped temperatures to as low as 50 degrees early today
and brought thunderstorms to Wyoming and North Dakota.
   Fog developed this morning over much of the Atlantic Coast
states, the upper Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from northern Illinois
into northern Indiana, central West Virginia and over Maryland and
southern New Jersey.
   The high temperature in the nation Tuesday was 116 degrees at
Bullhead City, Ariz., and Lake Havasu City, Ariz.
   Today's foreceast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast region into Florida, as
well as from the southern and central Appalachians across the upper
Ohio Valley into northern New England. Showers and thunderstorms
also were forecast this afternoon and evening across the southern
Rockies into the southern Plateau.
   Predicted highs: 60s and 70s along parts of the Pacific Coast;
70s in the southern Rockies; 80s along the western half of the Gulf

<HEAD>Klan Leader Says Race Relations Course Won't Change His Attitude</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Ku Klux Klan leader who agreed to
attend a race relations course to settle a lawsuit over a clash
with civil rights marchers says the classroom sessions won't change
his attitude toward blacks.
   ``I will sit through that course, but I will leave with the same
opinion I walk in there with,'' Roger Handley said Tuesday.
   Handley, former grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,
was one of 10 people named in a federal lawsuit stemming from a
1979 clash between robed Klansmen and black civil rights marchers
in Decatur.
   Under a settlement filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the
defendants agreed to pay $11,500 in damages to the marchers,
perform community service and refrain from harassing blacks or
joining any Klan or white supremacist group for up to five years.
   The Klansmen also agreed to take a race relations course taught
by civil rights leaders. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said he would help lead
the two one-hour sessions, probably next year in Birmingham.
   Handley told the Birmingham Post-Herald the settlement ``was
just a way of getting out of the lawsuit.''
   ``We could have been in court for six weeks, and with attorneys'
fees, we'd be getting into thousands of dollars just to defend
me,'' he said.
   ``But I haven't changed my opinions whatsoever. I know
race-mixing is wrong,'' he said, adding, ``I don't believe God
meant for any two races to live in one nation.''
   Lowery said he was hopeful the course would ease racial tensions.
   ``This workshop will be an opportunity for these people who are
acting out of racial prejudice to understand themselves a little
more, and for us to understand their motives and what misled them,
and we hope they can see the need to accept the oneness of the
human family,'' Lowery said from SCLC headquarters in Atlanta.
   Handley, however, said the class could serve another purpose.
   ``I've always felt like the more you know about an enemy, the
better off you are. It's possible I may get some very valuable
information that I'll use later on,'' he said.
   Handley said he would abide by the part of the settlement
requiring him to refrain from joining any white supremacist group,
including the Klan, for two years.
   The civil lawsuit was filed after investigators from the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery uncovered evidence that
prompted the Justice Department to reopen its investigation of the
May 26, 1979, incident in Decatur.
   The blacks, led by Lowery, were protesting the conviction the
year before of a 19-year-old mentally retarded black man for raping
three white women. Two Klansmen and two blacks were wounded by
gunfire in the ensuing struggle.
   Handley and nine other Klan members were indicted in 1984 on
civil rights charges. All either pleaded guilty or were convicted.
   Earlier this year, Handley and six others drew federal sentences
ranging from two months to two years for their roles in the
violence. One of the 10 has died.
   Handley, a 44-year-old disabled sheet metal worker, spent four
months in jail earlier this year. But he said he committed no crime
and pleaded guilty on the advice of his attorney.
   The civil case was to have gone to trial next week. The
settlement still must receive court approval.

<HEAD>Council President Says Witnesses Should Be Under Oath in Mayor Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council president said he wants to
put witnesses under oath to get to the truth about murky financial
dealings that have been linked to Mayor Tom Bradley.
   John Ferraro also said Tuesday that the council should have the
power to issue subpoenas and hire special counsel, an apparent sign
of impatience with other investigations of the mayor's affairs.
   City auditors, meanwhile, revealed more details about
alterations to the city's financial records, saying certain details
in bids for city deposits submitted by a savings and loan had been
blotted out with typewriter correction fluid.
   Bradley denied any knowledge about the alterations and dismissed
speculation that he might resign.
   ``To anyone who has any such thoughts, I'll be around here four
years from now, as mayor of this city,'' Bradley told repvestments. ``Nor
have I in any way tried to cover up.''
   But Rittenberg was unable to satisfy council members about the
alterations during his second day of testimony.
   He said two staff members have accused each other of ``whiting
out'' the reference to the mayor on the Far East form. Those two
staff members were expected to be called to testify later this week.
   ``This whole thing reeks,'' Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky told the
treasurer.
   Bradley said he would not comment on the matter until City
Attorney James Hahn has completed an investigation.
   ``Nobody wishes that that thing would be over faster than I
do,'' Bradley said.
   But Ferraro, the council president, complained about the pace of
the attorney's probe. ``Jim Hahn talks rather slowly and I think
the investigation is moving rather slowly, too,'' he said.
   The committee also heard reports of other altered documents.
   Typewriter correction fluid often was used to blot out interest
rate details on bids submitted by Gibraltar Savings and Loan for
city deposits, said John Pearson, an auditor for the City
Administrative Office. Bradley personally held a bond that earned a
favorable interest rate from Gibraltar.
   In one case, Pearson said, a Gibraltar bid of 7.6 percent was
blotted out and a revised bid of 7.5 percent was entered. In
another, the bid dropped from 7.8 percent to 7.4 percent.
   The difference of a few tenths of a percent represents tens of
thousands of dollars in interest payments to the city, Pearson said.
   Gibraltar, an ailing Beverly Hills thrift, was seized by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which declared the institution
unsound on March 31.
   A statement issued by the thrift Tuesday said an internal review
showed Gibraltar received no special benefit from its transactions
with the city.
   ``We will continue to cooperate fully with city investigators
and will readily comment further when the investigation is
complete,'' Gibraltar's statement concluded.

<HEAD>Plane Makes Emergency Landing at Newark Airport After Hydraulics
Fail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Continental Airlines DC-9 suffered partial
hydraulic failure and fishtailed in an emergency landing at Newark
International Airport. None of the 89 people aboard the flight were
injured, officials said.
   A light indicating a hydraulic problem lit up in the cockpit of
Flight 354 about 20 minutes before its scheduled landing at Newark
Tuesday evening, spokesman Ned Walker said in a telephone interview
from Continental's headquarters in Houston. The flight was coming
from Chicago.
   The plane appeared to have suffered a loss of one of its
hydraulic systems, and a partial loss of the other, Walker said.
But unlike the DC-10 that crashed in Iowa last week, the DC-9
doesn't require hydraulics for maneuverability, he said.
   Four of the DC-9's six tires blew out and the plane fishtailed
as it skidded three-quarters of the way down the 9,800-foot runway
shortly after 8 p.m. It ended up sitting perpendicular on the
runway.
   ``The captain had full control of the aircraft at all times,
full control of the landing gear and flaps,'' Walker said. Control
of a DC-9's landing gear and flaps is improved by the hydraulic
systems, but they continue working if hydraulics are lost, he said.
   The tires blew out because the captain, following established
procedures, turned off an anti-skid system designed to prevent the
wheels from locking up, Walker said.
   Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, said the plane dumped fuel before landing. About
six fire trucks and ambulances were waiting at the runway, she said.
   Tom Broyles, a passenger from Houston, said his first thoughts
flashed to last week's United Airlines crash in Sioux City that
killed 111 people.
   ``I've been flying about 40 years and this was the worst,'' he
said. ``While my head was down between my legs, I took the
opportunity to say my prayers.''
   Walker said the 82 passengers were instructed to brace for the
landing. They and the seven crew members disembarked on an
emergency ladder.

   The dollar fell sharply against all major
currencies in thin European trading early today as the market
focused of cross-trading between other currencies. Gold prices were
mixed.
   Dealers said the dollar was likely to fluctuate within a narrow
range before Thursday's release of the first estimate of U.S. gross
national product figures for the second quarter.
   The British pound was little changed against most currencies in
nervous dealings before today's release of British merchandise
trade figures for June. But, against the dollar, it jumped to
$1.6369 from $1.6185 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.92 Japanese yen to a closing 141.43 yen.
Later, in London, it fell further to 140.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8820 West German marks, down from 1.9085
   _1.6168 Swiss francs, down from 1.6440
   _6.3775 French francs, down from 6.4600
   _2.1260 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1490
   _1,358.50 Italian lire, down from 1,374.75
   _1.1867 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1890
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $372.45 a troy ounce, up
from $372.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $371.50.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $371.90, up from $371.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to a closing bid of
$372.44.
   Silver bullion edged up in London to a bid price of $5.21 a troy
ounce, up from $5.20 bid late Tuesday.

   The State Bar wants to make something
perfectly clear _ the language of its 117,000 members.
   The bar's Board of Governors voted at a weekend meeting to
``promote and foster the use of plain English'' among lawyers, who
are prone to legalese.
   ``Even simple questions such as `Is that what the house looks
like?' can be tortured into `Is this a fair and accurate depiction
of the premises alleged to be located within the confines of Modoc
County?''' observed San Diego attorney John Seitman in a background
paper for his fellow board members.
   Several other states, but not California, have passed laws
requiring plain English in legal documents, Seitman said.
   The board voted to urge lawyers to simplify forms and language
used in the practice of law. The plan also tells bar staff to
develop ``simple-language guidelines'' for communicating with the
public and for helping lawyers communicate with clients.
   The governors took the first step themselves, removing the word
``hereby'' from the resolution establishing the program.

he quickly found out they stuck out like tumbleweeds in Manhattan
with their preppie attire.
   ``We came in with L.L. Bean shoes, Brooks Brothers shirts,
little checked chefs pants _ I always work in chefs pants,'' Elgort
said. ``Now they're quietly hanging in my room.''
   The entourage was barred from some sections of the rodeo arena
because they didn't have proper western wear.
   Organizers of the ``Daddy of 'Em All'' are used to the dilemma
and have a closet full of plaid, check and fringed shirts along
with a stack of straw cowboy hats. But the Vogue crew decided only
a shopping spree could solve their problem.
   ``Everyone in our group must have spent $300 in Western
Outfitters today _ and that's the joke of its all _ it will even go
over well in New York,'' Elgort said.

up 6th pvs, `Underlying the ...' ^By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Talks among warring Cambodian factions will resume
Thursday, two days after they broke up in disarray over the Khmer
Rouge's future role, resistance coalition leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk announced.
   But the talks will now be limited to the single issue of
establishing who will represent Cambodia at an important
international peace conference scheduled to open Sunday, Sihanouk
told a news conference today.
   Sihanouk insists on a single Cambodian delegation, including all
four factions: the Vietnamese-backed government of Prime Minister
Hun Sen, the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the non-communist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front and Sihanouk's own group.
   Hun Sen wants two delegations, one for his Vietnamese-installed
government and one led by Sihanouk, representing the rebel
coalition. He blamed the presence of the Khmer Rouge for blocking
all chance of agreement.
   Underlying the dispute is a disagreement over the Khmer Rouge
participation in the negotiations and in any post-war coalition
government after the promised Sept. 27 withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops.
   ``The Khmer Rouge are monsters. It's understood,'' Sihanouk
during today's news conference at a hotel near Charles de Gaulle
airport. ``But that is no reason that we should become a
protectorate of Vietnam.''
   The strongest rebel group, the Khmer Rouge was responsible for
nearly 1 million deaths as it tried to radically restructure
society during a three-year reign that ended with the Vietnamese
invasion in 1978.
   The Khmer Rouge armed force of 45,000 men has not been beaten by
the Vietnamese Army and is the strongest of the resistance factions.
   After Tuesday's meeting _ the first official encounter between
the four factions _ the participants said they had reached an
impasse.
   ``It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot
continue its journey,'' Hun Sen said. He blamed the Khmer Rouge for
the breakdown in talks.
   ``I will not change my position, it is clear. There is no use
meeting again,'' Sihanouk told reporters Tuesday as he left the
18th century chateau west of Paris where the four-hour meeting took
place.
   But further discussions behind the scenes Tuesday night were
able to get the talks restarted. The prince said French officials
had asked him to keep trying ``so that there might be at least a
few small steps toward a solution.''
   Sihanouk met Hun Sen separately on Monday and on Tuesday was
joined by the other members of the resistance _ Son Sann, a
moderate former prime minister and head of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front, and Khieu Samphan, the nominal chief of
the Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk has contended that not including the Khmer Rouge would
lead to civil war. Vietnam, the Soviet Union, the United States and
most of the international community want to make sure the Khmer
Rouge never takes power again in Cambodia.
   Two of the issues to be discussed next week are how power will
be shared and how to verify that Vietnamese troops have gone home
and not just changed into Cambodian uniforms.
   Resistance forces maintain that more than 30,000 Vietnamese
troops have been integrated into Hun Sen's army.
   Sunday's conference will include the participation of India,
Japan, Canada, Australia, the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France. Also attending is the six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations: Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia, Philippines, Brunei and Singapore.
   The talks have coincided with a surge in fighting between
Cambodian guerrillas and Vietnamese-backed government troops along
the Thai-Cambodian border, Thai and Western officials there said.
   Several thousand Khmer Rouge guerrillas have taken part, the
Western analysts said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Today, Cambodian government gunners shelled at least four Thai
villages as part of an intensified campaign against Cambodian
guerrillas along the Thai-Cambodian frontier, Thai military
officers said.
   Last week, shelling believed to have been conducted by
pro-Vietnamese troops forced the evacuation of nearly 40,000
refugees from a Khmer Rouge border refugee camp known as Site 8.
Most have since returned.

<HEAD>Property Value Plunge Blamed on China Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today announced a winning bid
for a key downtown property that was far below original
expectations, the latest gauge of how China's bloody crackdown has
shaken this territory.
   Great Eagle Co. bid $346 million for the 95,000-square-foot lot,
the last major tract of downtown land expected to be sold by the
government before 1997, when Britain returns Hong Kong to China.
   Hong Kong government property sales are carefully scrutinized
because of the importance the real estate market plays in the
colony's economy and the disproportionate significance property
groups have on the stock exchange.
   The property had been expected to fetch perhaps as much as $641
million before Chinese troops on June 3-4 crushed the pro-democracy
movement, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   But China's suppression has increased fears about the colony's
future under Chinese rule and, since the crackdown, estimates on
the winning bid had been around $385 million or slightly higher.
   Bob Pope, acting director of the government's Buildings and
Lands Department, said he was ``satisfied'' with the winning bid in
view of recent events in China, even though it was below his April
estimate of $513 million.
   ``I regard it as a vote of confidence in the future,'' he said
of the winning bid, noting that the entire project involves an
investment of about $641 million. Great Eagle is expected to build
two office towers on the site.
   ``The sort of returns that are expected probably equate to a
drop in the market somewhat, but not as great as indicated in the
press,'' he said.
   The stock market fell sharply on Friday when news began to leak
about the bids for the lot. It closed today at 2489.03, a modest
drop from Tuesday's 2517.02 closing.

<TEXT>
   A company sold millions of cases of orange juice
as 100 percent pure but had substituted beet sugar, waste water and
other products in violation of federal law, the goverment said in
an indictment.
   The government said those substitutes accounted for 15 percent
to 40 percent of the orange juice concentrate sold by the now
defunct Bodine's Inc. of Chicago from 1978 to 1985.
   The federal indictment announced Tuesday charges two former
owners and a top executive of the orange juice company with
conspiracy.
   The indictment cites 18 instances in which beet sugar, corn
sugar, monosodium glutamate, grapefruit solids and other
substitutes were used in the orange juice concentrate in violation
of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, said U.S. Attorney
Anton Valukas.
   The company increased its annual sales from $5 million to $100
million over the same period, the indictment said. About the same
time, concentrated orange juice solid cost $1.29 per pound,
compared with 29 cents a pound for beet sugar.
   The Food and Drug Administration began its probe of the company
in the early 1980s, after a customer suffered a negative reaction
to the sugar content in a can of juice, Valukas said.
   Between 1983 and 1985, about 7 million cases of products were
produced for sale nationwide to more than 150 supermarket chains
and wholesalers under 50 different labels. Among the best know
labels were Scot Brand, Heritage House and Red Owl.
   ``There are no allegations that consumers were at risk as a
result of the substitutions ... even though they used, at times,
the waste water stream from a distillation system,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Pierre Talbert. ``Obviously, though, they were able
to undersell their competition.''
   Named in the indictment were Bodine's former owners, Edward
Boden Sr. and Edward Boden Jr., both of Chicago; and Roger Walsh
Jr., formerly vice president of finance and now a Texas resident.
If convicted, all three face a maximum of 57 years in prison and
$4.75 million in fines.
   Roger Walsh Sr., a former chief executive officer of Bodine's
who held a 20 percent share of the company, also was named as an
unindicted co-conspirator.
   The manufacturing operation, located on the city's West Side,
was sold in 1985 to McCain OJ Inc. Talbert said McCain was not
connected to the scheme alleged in the indictment.

<HEAD>Tax Writers Disagree on Catastrophic Illness Financing</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf, The most, to CORRECT percentage who pay surtax
to 40 sted 60 percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House tax-writers disagree about whether the
hard-fought changes they voted in the financing of catastrophic
illness insurance for older Americans will stop the complaints of
those who have to pay.
   As a rule, couples with incomes below $25,000 and singles with
incomes under $15,000 would pay slightly more than under current
law. Except for those with highest incomes, most others would pay
less.
   The most important change is cutting by half the surtax paid by
about 40 percent of those 65 and older.
   ``It's a major gain for middle-income seniors'' who would pay a
lower surtax under the amendments approved Tuesday by the House
Ways and Means Committee, said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
   But people with incomes under about $20,000 a year will have to
pay a higher flat monthly premium, said Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mich.
   ``That's regressive,'' he said, adding that he will continue
efforts to repeal the program.
   The committee's amendment, approved in a closed-door session by
a 19-17 vote, would allow older Americans a one-time chance to turn
down catastrophic coverage _ but only if they also give up Medicare
Part B, which covers doctors' bills.
   Because of that condition, Donnelly said, the program ``is about
as voluntary as a prison sentence.''
   The panel reversed itself and agreed to retain the law that
permits individuals to deduct 10 percent of interest on credit
cards, education loans and car loans next year. To help pay for
continuing a special tax benefit for banks and corporate
executives, the committee had voted earlier to end the writeoff
after this year, when a 20 percent deduction is permitted.
   Resolving the catastrophic issue left the committee with one
major issue: whether to reduce the tax on capital gains, which
applies to profits from sales of stocks and other property.
   President Bush wants a reduction to stimulate the economy,
saying it would raise revenues. Democratic leaders, including
Speaker Thomas Foley and committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of
Illinois, oppose a cut because the bulk of the benefit would go to
high-income Americans. Democrats also insist a cut would lose money
after a year or two.
   A majority of the committee _ 13 Republicans and six Democrats _
backs a capital-gains cut, but Rostenkowski has delayed a vote
while he attempts to change some minds.
   On the catastrophic illness issue, the committee voted to:
   _Cut the surtax in half. Current law requires anyone eligible
for Medicare to pay a surtax of 15 percent of federal income tax
over $150, but no one with less income pays the surtax. About 60
percent pay some surtax, but fewer than 6 percent pay the maximum,
which this year is $800.
   Under the committee action, the surtax would be cut to 7.5
percent this year and 12.5 percent next year. It would rise to 14
percent by 1993.
   _Raise the flat monthly premium that all but the poorest
retirees pay for catastrophic coverage. Current law sets that
premium at $4 in 1989, $4.90 next year, and $10.20 by 1993. That is
in addition to the monthly premium, now $27.90, paid for Part B
Medicare coverage. The charge is scheduled to rise to $29 next year
and to $33.40 by 1993.
   The committee voted to raise the total monthly premium to $38.40
in 1990, with additional increases of 50 cents in 1991 and 10 cents
in each of the following two years.
   _Increase the prescription deductible, the annual amount of
out-of-pocket expenses for drugs that a beneficiary must pay before
catastrophic reimbursement begins, to $650 in 1991 and $950 in
1992. Those figures are $200 and $300, respectively, above current
law. Most of the drug coverage does not begin until 1991.

   It is now illegal in France to tie an elastic band
to your feet and jump off into the void.
   The practice had become a minor fad, with the courageous or
reckless flinging themselves off, for example, the Eiffel Tower and
bouncing headfirst several times in midair.
   The government issued its temporary ban last week after a third
death this year resulting from the fad.
   Emmanuel Bottin, a 27-year-old Frenchman, was killed July 18
when the elastic band attaching him to a bridge in the Alps snapped
on the third bounce, dropping him into the rocks 100 feet below.
   ``This is a new and dangerous physical activity,'' the French
Interior and Sports Ministries said in a joint statement late last
week. ``Such an activity cannot continue without serious guarantees
for the safety of the participants being required of organizers.''
   There was no indication how long it would take to draw up
regulations under which the sport could resume.

<TEXT>
   ``Why the moon? Why Mars?'' asked President
Bush. ``Because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to seek, to
find.''
   And, he might have added, ``not to yield.''
   That, at least is how Tennyson phrased it in ``Ulysses,'' the
poem that served as a source of inspiration for Bush's
speechwriters on the 20th anniversary of man's first steps on the
moon.
   Bush enunciated lofty goals for a U.S. space program fallen on
harder times since its Apollo glory days.
   First a space station, then back to the moon, ``and then a
journey into tomorrow ... a manned mission to Mars,'' declared the
president, standing beside the graying heroes of Apollo 11, Neil
Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.
   If royalties were payable on 19th century poems, the heirs of
Alfred, Lord Tennyson would be raking in money. ``Ulysses'' is one
of the most widely quoted poems in the language, a favorite of
politicians and English teachers alike. Its ringing rhetoric fits
many occasions from high school graduations to affairs of state.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used the phrase _ ``to
strive, to seek, to find'' _ in welcoming Ronald Reagan back from a
summit in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts borrowed the same words in
a dramatic speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New
York conceding victory to Jimmy Carter.
   Had he but time enough, there was more that Bush might have
borrowed from this archly romantic poem about the wily warrior of
Greek myth.
   It is a poem about Ulysses not in his prime, not in his myriad
of misadventures on the circuitous, 20-year route home from the
Trojan wars, but about the ennui that settled in after he has been
back in Ithaca for a few years.
   ``It little profits that an idle king,
   By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
   Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole
   Unequal laws unto a savage race,
   That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.''
   Like the peripatetic Bush, who has traveled the world in his six
months as president, this senescent adventurer cannot wait to hit
the road again.
   ``I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
   Life to the lees ...
   Much have I seen and known; cities of men
   And manners, climates, councils, governments,
   Myself not least, but honor'd of them all.''
   This Ulysses _ having outwitted the Cyclops, navigated Scylla
and Charybdis, escaped the clutches of Circe and rescued his wife,
the faithful Penelope, from her overbearing suitors _ wants to
leave the dull business of running the island to son Telemachus,
whose disposition apparently was more suited to bureaucratic
affairs.
   ``He works his work, I mine,'' said the father.
   As the poem builds to its stirring climax, Ulysses summons
former comrades to join him in pursuit of new adventure:
   ``The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
   Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
   'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
   Push off ... for my purpose holds
   To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
   Of all the western stars, until I die.''
   Scholars differ on whether Tennyson intended to lionize this
geriatric adventurer _ or debunk his dreams.
   On Capitol Hill, where Bush said ``our future as a spacefaring
nation will be decided,'' the presidential rhetoric rang hollow to
many.
   Democrats said the soaring speech failed to address how much
Bush's space goals would cost or where the money would come from to
pay for them.
   ``The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can
marshal the words but the resources to restore America's
preeminence in space,'' chided House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri.
   Gephardt didn't resort to verse but he got his point across.
   ``In sum, Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free
launch.''

<HEAD>Lightning Causes New Forest Fires in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lightning has ignited new forest fires
in central Canada, and 23,000 people were kept from returning home
in three provinces.
   ``We're not making any plans to move anybody back,'' Ryan Kustra
of the Manitoba Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday night.
``Until the situation is stablized and safe, we're not going to
move them back and then move them out again.''
   The fires, the region's worst in memory, have destroyed more
than 3.7 million acres of forest in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Ontario.
   However, no injuries or deaths have been reported.
   Light rain cooled some fires Tuesday, but lightning caused
others. More showers were expected today.
   In northeastern Saskatchewan, rain dampened two fires
threatening the community of Sandy Bay. But spokesmen for the
provincial forest fire management center said the fires still were
burning.
   ``It's too large to be brought under control in one day,'' said
duty officer Darryl Rowland. ``We'd need a lot more rain to put it
out.''
   At least 200 firefighters are battling the area's blazes. One
crew cut through more than a mile of brush with axes as it tried to
halt approaching flames.
   Fred Bear of Sandy Bay has been cooking for a 10-man crew
fighting fire in the area for the last week. Flames came within 60
yards of their camp.
   ``The smoke was so thick that we had to wrap wet towels around
our faces to breathe,'' he said Tuesday.
   Since Thursday, more than 23,000 people had to leave homes in
remote northern communities as flames advanced. They are staying in
hotels, schools, churches and privates homes.
   About 225 fires were burning in Manitoba, 150 in Ontario, and
about 165 in Saskatchewan, officials said. Most have been caused by
lightning.
   Roads in the fire areas are virtually shut down.
   Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon has said firefighting efforts there
and the massive evacuation will cost more than $30 million.
   In Ottawa on Tuesday, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney promised
``every conceivable support'' from the federal government.
   In northern Ontario, rescuers on Tuesday airlifted out 44 people
stranded in the community of Kasabonika. The area was blanketed in
smoke from five forest fires.
   Almost 600 people _ mostly elderly people with breathing
problems and mothers and children _ have fled northwestern Ontario
in the last week.

   Two ranking editors at the New York Post left

   No replacements have been named for James A. Fabris, one of the

said Post spokesman Gary Lewi. ``It is my understanding that is was
mutually agreed that it was time for them to pursue other careers
outside the Post,'' he told The New York Times.
   Fabris came to the Post under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch,

year. He shared the managing editor title with Lou Colasuonno.
Belsky had worked 19 years for the newspaper.

<TEXT>
   The government has ignored its own warnings to
improve defenses against spies, the Senate Intelligence Committee
says in a report that comes as embassy security undergoes new
scrutiny in the Felix S. Bloch espionage case.
   In unusually harsh language, the committee said ``bureaucratic
infighting'' has paralyzed the new Security Evaluation Office,
established last year under CIA Director William Webster to bolster
anti-spy efforts at U.S. embassies around the world.
   ``It has failed to achieve its objectives,'' the panel said in
an assessment written before last week's public revelation that
Bloch, once the No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was
under investigation for allegedly passing secrets to the Soviet
Union. Ranking committee members had been informed of the Bloch
case, absent his name, in late June.
   While the report deals mainly with technological efforts to
thwart spying at U.S. posts abroad, it highlights the State
Department's longstanding reputation among intelligence
professionals for giving short shrift to security.
   The panel noted, for example, that the State Department has
failed to create a top-level office for a director of diplomatic
security, despite the administration's own recommendation for such
a position following a series of studies ending in 1987.
   But several former diplomats and counterintelligence officials
said in interviews Tuesday that the department has tried to improve
anti-spy efforts.
   James Nolan, the recently retired head of the department's
Office of Foreign Missions and longtime deputy FBI
counterintelligence chief, said several FBI experts have been hired
by the department.
   And George A. Carver, Jr., who was deputy for national
intelligence for two CIA directors, said ``one of the toughest
things to do is have counterintelligence in an open society. I'm
not suggesting we become a police state, but I think we do need to
review our policies.'' Carver supports lie detector tests for
foreign service officers, like those given regularly to
intelligence officers.
   Since the ``year of the spy'' in 1985, when 12 Americans were
arrested for spying, espionage cases have ``not abated, either in
terms of their number or their seriousness,'' the Senate committee
said.
   In a bill authorizing intelligence activities for the two years
beginning Oct. 1, the panel has mandated that the FBI be given
primary responsibility for investigating spying by anyone
associated with the U.S. government.
   The move follows criticism of the Naval Investigative Service's
initial investigation of reports that Marine security guards at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow let Soviet agents roam the building after
hours.
   But the document's recommendations also can be read as
applicable to initial moves n the Bloch case, where the first
interviews with him were conducted by State Department security
officers.
   Bloch was suspended with pay and his State Department clearance
lifted on June 22, but government sources said he had been tipped
earlier by the Soviet KGB spy agency that he was under surveillance.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, asked at a news
briefing in Moscow today whether Bloch was ever connected to the
KGB or other East bloc intelligence agency, said ``that is pure
speculation.'' Told by reporters that he could end the speculation,
he said ``the speculation has not been confirmed.''
   Congressional intelligence officials, who declined to be
identified by name, said Tuesday it is odd that the government has
not yet been able to pull together enough information to arrest the
diplomat. Ranking members of the congressional intelligence
committees typically are briefed about such cases only when an
arrest is likely within hours or days. In the Bloch case, such
briefings took place roughly a month ago.
   The Senate committee last week cut the Bush administration's
request for the Security Evaluation Office from $9 million to $4.5
million ``because of lack of cooperation demonstrated by both State
Department and the intelligence community.'' The money will be
restored if the organizations can learn to work together, it said.
   The office was intended to assemble intelligence experts to
evaluate security ``threats, vulnerabilities and countermeasures,''
the committee said. But the State Department has failed to consult
the office on embassy security, and intelligence officials have
been unwilling to recognize legitimate department concerns, the
report said.
   The panel reserved its strongest language for a warning against
trying to salvage the partially completed new U.S. Embassy building
in Moscow, which is riddled with KGB listening devices the CIA
still does not completely understand.
   President Reagan concluded the structure should be demolished,
but the Bush administration is reconsidering. ``Reversing that
decision would invite another security disaster and confirm signs
that the executive branch is incapable of effective action in this
field,'' the committee said.

<HEAD>Priest Goes to North Korea to Escort Back Radical Student</HEAD>

   A Roman Catholic priest flew to North
Korea today to escort a radical student from the South back across
the border. The government in Seoul threatened to arrest them both.
   Government prosecutors said the nation's intelligence agency
also would launch an investigation of dissident Catholics.
   South Korea bans unauthorized trips to communist North Korea
such as the one made by the 20-year-old student, Im Su-kyong.
   The government has also declared the border crossing would
violate the cease-fire accord that ended the Korean War and said
both the student and priest will be arrested after entering South
Korea.
   The Association of Priests for Justice, a Catholic dissident
group, said Moon Gyu-hyon, a Philippines-based priest, flew to
North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, via Tokyo and Beijing. The
association sponsored the trip.
   Moon was recently assigned to the Philippines after he finished
studies at New York's Maryknoll Seminary.
   ``The church has the duty to protect its lamb,'' said a
statement from the Seoul-based group.
   It said the group believed Ms. Im had made the trip ``in a move
representing the patriotic sentiments of young students for
unification.''
   ``She is a Catholic. It is our duty to support her,'' said the
statement.
   While in North Korea, Ms. Im attended an international youth
festival July 1-8.
   The Catholic group's statement said Moon holds a South Korean
passport and a permanent U.S. residence permit. It said he was
expected to return with Ms. Im through the border village of
Panmunjom on Thursday.
   That day marks the anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the
1950-53 Korean War between the North and South. The crossing would
carry symbolic value for radicals and dissidents who are demanding
Korean reunification.
   The Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's official news
service, said today that Ms. Im had arrived in the town of Kaesong
near Panmunjom. The report, monitored in Tokyo, said she was
traveling as part of a group of 30 anti-nuclear peace marchers who
favor reunification. It quoted her as telling a rally in Kaesong
that the peninsula should be united.
   Radical students and dissidents in South Korea said rallies
would be held to welcome her home, but attempts to hold protests in
recent weeks have been thwarted by police. National Police Director
Kim Woo-hyun said authorities will block any attempts by protesters
to reach Panmunjom to greet Ms. Im.
   The Joong-ang Daily News said 20,000 riot police would be placed
on alert for demonstrations in Seoul.
   Government prosecutors said the Agency for National Security
Planning, the intelligence agency, would investigate 16 Catholic
priests who belong to the standing committee of the Association of
Priests for Justice.
   The prosecutors said the priests would be investigated in
connection with laws that prohibit unauthorized visits to the north.

   Heavy rains drenched South Korea's
southern coast, spawning floods and mudslides that killed at least
36 people and forced thousands from their homes, officials said
today.
   Another 50 people were reported missing in the flooding, which
disrupted air, land and sea travel, the National Disaster Center
said.
   South Korean newspapers, gathering their own statistics,
reported at least 93 people killed or missing and more than 55,000
people driven from their homes.
   By this evening, up to 17.2 inches of rain had fallen in a
two-day period, the center said. Center officials said 34,500
people were homeless because of flooding.
   The disaster center said 7,880 homes and buildings were
inundated or destroyed and estimated losses from damaged crops,
highways and other public facilities at $15 million.
   Most of the homeless were taken to schools, churches and other
makeshift shelters and the government rushed in blankets, food and
other relief supplies, the officials said.
   Hardest hit was South Cholla, which received an average of 13
inches of rain on Monday and Tuesday, the officials said. Thirty
people were killed and 29 others were reported missing in the area.
   Most of the victims were killed in landslides or drowned in
rain-swollen creeks or rivers, they said.
   An emergency evacuation order was issued for about 30,000 people
because of the rising waters of the Youngsan River, they said.
   Weathermen in Kwangju, the capital city of South Cholla, said
the Youngsan's level passed its danger point of 31 feet early
today, the first time it reached that level since the are weather
bureau opened 60 years ago.
   Military helicopters rushed to rescue about 500 people isolated
by the bloated river, officials said.
   Rescuers continued to try to evacuate several hundred people
marooned in the towns of Changsung and Pulkyo, which were virtually
submerged.

<TEXT>
   The four-year-old ``Night Stalker'' serial
killing trial of Richard Ramirez is nearing its finale as the fate
of the 29-year-old drifter is submitted to jurors who will weigh 13
murder charges.
   In the final hours of closing arguments, a prosecutor called for
Ramirez to be convicted of gruesome crimes he called ``consummate
acts of cowardice.''
   A defense attorney urged jurors to bring in verdicts of
innocent, claiming there was reasonable doubt that Ramirez really
was the devil-worshipping ``Night Stalker'' who murdered, raped and
robbed his victims while forcing some to ``swear to Satan.''
   Ramirez once shouted ``Hail Satan'' in court and displayed a
pentagram _ the inverted star symbol associated with devil worship
_ drawn on his palm.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan planned to instruct jurors in
the law today, then submit the case for deliberations.
   The tall, shaggy-haired Ramirez, of El Paso, Texas, is charged
with 13 murders and 30 related felonies during a series of slayings
in the summer of 1985. Witnesses have identified him as the
intruder who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors.
   ``These were murders of men in their sleep, rapes and sodomy of
women after their husbands were dead,'' declared Deputy District
Attorney P. Philip Halpin. In the final moments of his reply to
defense arguments Tuesday, the prosecutor reminded jurors of
physical evidence found at several murder scenes that linked
Ramirez to the killings. Among the items were pentagrams.
   ``Some of these cases are carbon copies of each other,'' said
Halpin.
   ``You have all the evidence in the world to reach the logical
and reasonable conclusion that the defendant is guilty as
charged,'' he concluded.
   Earlier, defense attorney Ray Clark suggested there was
reasonable doubt about Ramirez' guilt, that witnesses wrongly
identified him as the ``Night Stalker.''
   ``I'm asking you to go in, take a look at all the evidence,
discuss it among yourselves and come back with 43 not-guilty
verdicts,'' he told the jury.
   He acknowledged that Ramirez confessed he was the ``Night
Stalker'' but insisted he did it because he thought such
``bravado'' would impress other prisoners.
   ``Jail is a dangerous place to be,'' Clark said, ``and in the
pecking order the murderers get the most respect.''
   Halpin, in his reply, stressed that Ramirez has no contact with
other prisoners.
   ``If murderers are treated better (in jail) it doesn't matter,''
he said, ``because he's kept segregated. He's off in a room alone
for obvious reasons.''
   Two witnesses have said Ramirez told them: ``I am the Night
Stalker.''

<HEAD>Ships Sail into Besieged Christian Ports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cargo ships sailed into Christian ports
today to deliver food to the besieged Christian enclave, drawing
only light fire from Syrian gunners. A newspaper said an informal
truce was in effect.
   A police spokesman, said two of the vessels dropped anchor at
Beirut port in the city's Christian sector and three arrived in the
port of Jounieh, in the Christian heartland.
   The spokesman refused to give any information about the ships.
   He said Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west Beirut, fired
``only six howitzer shells'' at the Christian-controlled coastline
as the ships steamed slowly into dock.
   He said no casualties were reported and noted it was ``very
unusual of the Syrians not to fire heavily'' at ships heading for
ports in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   The daily newspaper An-Nahar said an ``undeclared truce'' had
taken effect in the 19-week confrontation between Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian forces and Moslem militias allied with Syrian
troops. The report could not be confirmed.
   The Syrian land and sea blockade imposed March 8 has left the
Christian community desperately short of fuel, food and other
supplies. It was imposed after Aoun blockaded illegal militia-run
ports south of Beirut.
   A spokesman for Aoun's headquarters who refused to be named
confirmed that ``several vessels'' anchored at Christian ports
overnight and said the Syrians ``fired a only few rounds... I don't
know why their barrage was not as intense as it usually is.''
   Also today, Syrian and Christian forces skirmished with
automatic rifles across Beirut's dividing Green Line, wounding nine
people.
   That raised the overall toll to 453 killed and 1,869 wounded in
the current round of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   An-Nahar said a three-member Arab League committee had won a
temporary truce after ``discreet contacts'' with the warring sides.
   The paper said the ``combatants agreed to give the committee
another chance to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict.'' It
did not elaborate.
   An-Nahar noted, however, that in the absence of any official
truce announcement ``it is not known how long the cease-fire would
last.''
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid were asked at an Arab League
summit in May to settle the Lebanese conflict by November.
   The Kuwaiti daily newspaper Al-Qabas, in a front-page report,
said the Arab committee has decided to freeze its mediation due to
Syria's refusal to accept Aoun as a negotiating partner.
   The paper quoted Syrian President Hafez Assad as telling the
Saudi, Moroccan and Algerian foreign ministers during a recent
meeting in Damascus: ``If our Lebanese allies accept Aoun as a
negotiator on behalf of the other party, we will not accept him.
This is a final and irreversible decision.''
   ``Accordingly, the three-member commitee has decided to freeze
its activities for a short period of time, pending a solution to
this snag,'' the report added.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, declared a ``war of liberation''
against Syria's 40,000 troops, who were deployed in predominantly
Moslem sections of Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate.
   The Christians contend the Syrian troops betrayed their mandate
by fighting on the Moslem side in the civil war.

<HEAD>Nominee Won't Push For Abrupt Cut Of Amtrak Funding</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 3rd graf, The Reagan, to include Amtrak
funding request.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee to head the Federal
Railroad Administration says he supports phasing out Amtrak funding
rather than abruptly cutting it off as proposed in the president's
budget.
   Gilbert E. Carmichael said during a Senate hearing Tuesday that
if confirmed, he would not push for a cutoff of Amtrak funding next
year.
   The Reagan administration tried for several years to get
Congress to drop the subsidy of the increasingly successful
passenger rail system, but Congress has kept the funding. The cut
also is proposed in Bush's fiscal 1990 budget.
   Amtrak is seeking a $656 million subsidy for fiscal 1990, which
begins Oct. 1. The railroad took in a record $1.1 billion in
revenue on its own last year.
   Sen. James Exon, who chaired the hearing, praised Carmichael's
position and said his nomination has wide support among committee
members. The hearing was held by the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee.
   ``I'm pleased to recognize your support for Amtrak,'' said Exon,
D-Neb.
   Carmichael said he agreed with Exon's assessment that his
position meant he would seek self-sufficiency for Amtrak ``a few
years down the road,'' rather than in the next year.
   Carmichael is a Meridian, Miss., automobile dealer and real
estate developer with wide experience in regional rail issues.
   Carmichael has served for the past four months as a consultant
in the Transportation Department, preparing for approval of his
nomination.
   ``I am committed to the preservation of a national rail
passenger network as part of a balanced transportation system and
helping it to be self-supporting and a vital part of the 21st
Century,'' he told the committee.
   He said he also wanted to play a key role in developing
high-speed trains to go up to 300 mph and trains operated by
magnetic levitation.
   Carmichael said that with gridlock on some roads and in the
skies over big cities, America's railroads are the one
transportation mode with excess capacity. He said only about 25
percent of the nation's rail capacity is being used.
   Carmichael has lost Republican races in Mississippi for
governor, lieutenant governor and the U.S. Senate. He served in
1976 as a federal commissioner for the National Transportation
Policy Study Commission.
   He also was chairman of the Sunbelt Rail Commission in 1985 and
has been a member of the Mississippi Advisory Committee of the
Civil Rights Commission.

<HEAD>Officials Want to Talk With Call Girl About Bloch Spy Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian officials investigating a senior
U.S. diplomat suspected of spying want to question a call girl with
whom he was involved, a senior government official said.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov today
ducked questions about the U.S. diplomat, who is suspected of
spying for the Soviets.
   The Austrian official, who spoke Tuesday on condition of
anonymity, confirmed a newspaper report quoting Interior Ministry
officials as saying the envoy, Felix S. Bloch, was involved with a
call girl.
   ``There is a woman with whom Mr. Bloch has maintained a long
relationship in Austria,'' the official said.
   ABC News reported from Washington last weekend that during
initial questioning by U.S. authorities, Bloch claimed at one point
that he spied because he fell into a Soviet sex trap, but the
network said investigators have discounted that story.
   The Austrian official told The Associated Press that the woman
is on vacation and believed to be out of the country.
   ``We have no reason to look for her abroad, but when she comes
back from her vacation we are going to talk to her to find out
whether she had any suspicions (of spying) in any direction,'' he
said.
   ``She is a source of information for us, but there is nothing
pending against her,'' he said, adding that the woman, who was in
her 30s, was an Austrian citizen and a Vienna resident.
   He emphasized this was just one of the lines being pursued by
the Austrian and American officials probing the Bloch affair.
   At a news briefing in Moscow today, Gerasimov was asked if Bloch
was ever connected to the KGB or any East Bloc intelligence agency.
He called such reports ``pure speculation.''
   Pressed by reporters who suggested that an explicit answer could
end speculation, he said only: ``The speculation has not been
confirmed.''
   In Washington, State Department officials declined to discuss
the report about the call girl. They have refused to respond to all
questions that could have a bearing on the investigation.
   Formerly the No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, the
54-year-old Bloch was placed on leave with pay on June 22. He has
surrendered his diplomatic passport and State Department
credentials, but he has not been charged with any crime nor has his
travel been restricted.
   Former U.S. ambassador to Austria, Helene Von Damm, has said
Bloch had the same top clearance as an ambassador for top-secret
information and thus knew the identities of CIA agents in Vienna.

   Blacks will seek medical care
at eight whites-only hospitals next week as part of a defiance
campaign protesting discrimination and segregated national
elections, anti-apartheid leaders announced today.
   The activists detailed the first phase of the campaign a day
after Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok threatened to crack down
on ``revolutionaries and radicals'' who were organizing the
protests.
   Vlok contended that the civil disobedience campaign, as well as
terrorist attacks, had been ordered by the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement in an effort to disrupt the
Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. Parliament has chambers for
whites, Asians and people of mixed-race, but the black majority is
excluded.
   A coalition of anti-apartheid groups, in statements issued at a
news conference, accused Vlok of trying to foster paranoia among
white voters and said the defiance campaign would be non-violent.
   ``It is our right to defy the criminal and illegal apartheid
regulations, which are denying our people the right to health care,
education, housing,'' one statement said. ``The government claims
to be dismantling apartheid. Our experience tells us otherwise.''
   Saki Macozome, an official of the South African Council of
Churches, said non-whites who required medical care would seek
treatment starting Aug. 2 at four white hospitals in Transvaal
Province and four in Natal Province.
   ``We will consider all hospitals to be open to all people from
Aug. 2 onwards,'' said a statement endorsed by the church council
and several leading anti-apartheid groups. These included the Black
Sash civil rights organization and the Congress of South African
Trade Union, the country's largest black labor federation.
   The groups gave no details about other planned actions during
the defiance campaign, but they confirmed that segregated
recreational facilities would be targeted. Activists denied Vlok's
allegation that the campaign would include fire-bomb attacks on the
homes of parliamentary candidates.
   Health Minister Willie van Niekerk said the authorities would
not allow health care to be disrupted by protesters.
   ``Any patient suffering from an acute illness will not be turned
away before receiving the necessary treatment, regardless of their
population group,'' van Niekerk said, adding that such patients
would be charged standard fees.
   People not requiring urgent care ``will be requested to leave
the premises in an orderly fashion,'' he said.
   Vlok, in a speech Tuesday, said disruptions of the election
campaign must be stopped ``at all costs.''
   However, the anti-apartheid groups said a crackdown on peaceful
protests could trigger a backlash.
   ``While the white leaders are campaigning to be elected, they
are once again planning to place the black leadership behind
bars,'' the statement said. ``Such actions by the state are
precisely what would precipitate the kind of uncontrolled violence
which Vlok is accusing us of planning.''

   Ethnic Russians stopped operations at 19
industrial plants in Estonia today and held protest meetings about
legislation they say favors the republic's ethnic Estonian
majority, strikers and news reports said.
   The walkouts, which began at seven plants on Tuesday, escalated
as Soviet officials ended a potentially disastrous strike by
roughly half the nation's 1 million miners.
   As many as 25,000 workers in Estonia stopped working, halting
operations at enterprises from electronics plants to a defense
industry factory, said Yevgeny Kolekhnik, chairman of the strike
committee at the Baltic Shipyard in Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
   Tens of thousands of workers attended protest meetings this
morning, said Yaroslav Tolstikhov, head of the economics section at
Sovietskaya Estoniya, Tallinn's Russian-language Communist Party
daily.
   ``Thousands, tens of thousands of people took part. It's hard to
say just how many,'' Tolstikhov said in a telephone interview.
   ``The strike isn't having a great economic impact,'' he added.
``It is mostly psychological.'' Many Tallinn industries are closed
for routine summer vacations.
   Strikers are complaining about a proposed law requiring that
people live in the republic two years before they can vote,
according to Rahve Haal and Sovietskaya Estoniya, two Communist
Party dailies in Estonia.
   They see the law as one more Estonian assertion of power. In
1988, thousands of ethnic Russians migrated to Estonia because the
republic enjoys a higher living standard than other parts of the
Soviet Union. Therefore, the law making people wait before voting
would primarily affect them.
   The Estonian strike comes as more miners returned to work. They
began striking July 11 and the unrest eventually closed mines from
the Ukraine to the Arctic.
   Miners began returning to work Thursday after officials agreed
to most of their demands, including increases in deliveries of meat
and soap and rights to share management of their industry.
   Many miners who had refused to return went back Tuesday after
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
signed a letter guaranteeing pay raises, longer vacations and other
benefits, said Yuri A. Bolderev, a strike leader from the Donetsk
basin, the biggest Soviet coal field.
   Coal Ministry officials said Tuesday that 79 mines remained
idle, most in the Donetsk basin, 550 miles south of Moscow in the
Ukraine, Tass reported.
   The national parliament, the Supreme Soviet, appealed Tuesday to
Soviet workers not to strike.
   Lawmakers said they would adopt laws by autumn giving workers
more control of management and profits and ensuring democratic
elections of local government officials. Kremlin leaders and the
miners have accused local authorities of insensitivity to workers'
problems.
   The coal strikes crippled coke and steel plants in much of the
Soviet Union, and meeting the miners' demands will cost an
estimated $4.6 billion to $8.6 billion, said Viktor G. Kurcherenko,
head of the parliamentary budget commission.
   The Estonia strike appeared minor in comparison.
   But it signals a possible increase in ethnic tension in Estonia,
which leads the drive in the 15 Soviet republics for greater
economic and political autonomy from Moscow.
   Estonians, who make up 65 percent of the republic's 1.6 million
people, have pushed through their parliament a law making Estonian
the official language, causing protests among Russians who comprise
28 percent of the population.
   It was unclear whether the national parliament would allow the
proposed election law to stand. The central newspaper Komsomolsaya
Pravda reported from Tallinn that just 58 of 244 deputies present
in parliament Monday opposed the law, virtually guranteeing its
passage.
   But the parliament decided to withhold final passage for at
least 10 days, said Tarmu Tammerk of Tallinn's weekly newspaper
Kodumaa.
   In October, the national parliament vetoed an Estonian law
giving the republic wide autonomy, but on Monday Gorbachev said he
would allow regional authorities greater latitude in carrying out
local elections scheduled for spring.
   The Estonian strike was organized by the Union of Soviet Working
Collectives, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda and press reports
read by Tammerk.
   Sovietskaya Estoniya carried photographs showing signs plastered
on the gates of the Dvigatil defense industry plant and one of the
shipyards saying, in Russian, ``We are on strike.''

   Former Beatle Ringo Starr, on his first U.S. tour
in more than a decade, has succeeded in blocking the release of an
album that he's displeased with.
   The album, due to be released this week, was put on hold Tuesday
for 30 days by a Superior Court judge while lawyers for the rock
star and a Memphis producer try to settle the issue.
   Judge Ralph Hicks continued a temporary order Starr had obtained
Monday, after he said he didn't like his drum performances and
wanted to redub them before the album's release.
   Starr also balked at a demand by CRS Records of College Park and
producer Chips Moman of Memphis, Tenn., that he pay them $146,239
to prevent release of the recordings, which Starr made in February
and April 1987. Moman had rejected Starr's offer of $100,000.
   Starr's lawyers accused Moman of trying to release the album on
an ``unheard-of label'' to take advantage of the former Beatle's
concert tour, which began earlier this month.
   Attorney Jane Stevens said CRS Records, which Moman formed with
a partner in April, could not handle the album ``in a manner
befitting an artist of (Starr's) stature.''
   Moman acknowledged that the label is new and operates out of his
lawyer's offices. But he said he wants to put the album out before
Starr has a chance to put out a live recording from his tour and
``kill any chances I got of getting anything off this product.''
   He also said he was frustrated by repeated efforts to reach the
singer and by Starr's refusal to use any song from the album during
his tour.
   Starr contended in his lawsuit that the original recordings'
quality was not up to his standards because Moman brought alcoholic
beverages to the recording sessions.

<HEAD>IRS Confiscates Money Found on Soul Singer in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown, already in
trouble for having an unauthorized $40,000 in his prison cell, has
lost the money to the Internal Revenue Service.
   The IRS seized $40,000 in certified checks and almost $600 cash
to pay back-taxes he owes, Corrections Department spokesman Francis
X. Archibald said today.
   Brown, serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault and
failing to stop for a police officer, could lose credit for good
behavior for having money in excess of the $50 prisoners are
allowed.
   The IRS claimed the money Thursday after officials saw news
reports about Brown's money last week, Archibald said.
   The singer's attorney, Buddy Dallas, said Brown's trouble with
the IRS dates to the early 1970s, when a Baltimore business the
singer owned was mismanaged.
   Neither the lawyer nor Archibald know why Brown had so much
money. He was moved from the State Park Correctional Institution to
the medium-security Stevenson Correctional Institution while the
incident is investigated.
   ``I'm told this man has been an exemplary prisoner,'' Dallas
said. ``Free James Brown and put the man back to work. I think
there's been a lot of good that's come out of this man and there's
a lot more to come.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today appointed four
bishops in Czechoslovakia, marking another breakthrough in Vatican
relations with the Soviet bloc.
   The appointments were made after years of negotiations with
Czechoslovakia's Communist government, which maintains rigid
controls on organized religion. The Vatican estimates that 60
percent of Czechoslovakia's 15 million people are Catholic.
   The pope's special envoy for Eastern Europe, Archbishop
Francesco Colasuonno, took part last week in the latest in a series
of talks in Czechoslovakia.
   The announcement came a day after the papal appointment of the
first bishop in the Soviet republic of Byelorussia in more than 60
years and the recent re-establishment of diplomatic relations with
Poland.
   ``These appointments do not mean that everything has been
resolved for the church in Czechoslovakia. We are still in the
initial stages,'' said deputy Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni
D'Ercole.
   Appointed were Monsignor Jan Sokol, 55, promoted from apostolic
administrator of Trnava to archbishop of that city; the Rev. Josef
Koukl, 62, a theology professor, as bishop of Litomerice; the Rev.
Frantisek Tondra, 53, a parish priest, as bishop of Spis; and the
Rev. Frantisek Vanak, 73, a parish priest, as apostolic
administrator of Olomouc.
   A written statement by D'Ercole said Vanak has all the powers of
a residential bishop and is expected to be given the rank of
archbishop soon.
   With the appointments, the church has now filled six of the 13
dioceses with bishops.
   The pope has often lamented the lack of bishops and the advanced
age of church officials who are led by 90-year Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, the archbishop of Prague.
   D'Ercole said negotiations are continuing to fill all the posts.
``We hope this is a question of months and not years,'' he said.
   The Vatican has refused to appoint any bishop who is a member of
the government-sponsored organization of clergy called Pacim in
Terris, and the D'Ercole said none of the four appointed today
belonged to it.
   In the first step forward in 15 years, the pope named three
bishops in May 1988 but none held the rank of residential bishop.
   The papal envoy, Colasuonno, has been negotiating with Vladimir
Janku, head of the government's religious affairs office.

   A Democratic politician has urged James
Garner to run for governor, saying he shares a trait with another
actor who once held the job.
   ``Everybody knows him,'' state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal said,
adding that his approach to Garner was rebuked.
   ``He said, `I'm making $6 million a year, what do I need that
for?' or words to the effect,'' Rosenthal said Monday.
   Garner's publicist, Pat Kingsley, confirmed the actor turned
down the informal proposal. ``He doesn't feel politics is the right
field for him,'' she said.
   Garner, once dubbed the ``last real man'' in America by People
magazine, has been active in environmental causes.
   Rosenthal said he approached Garner because the 61-year-old
actor is widely recognized thanks to his TV series ``Maverick'' and
``The Rockford Files'' and movies like ``Murphy's Romance,'' which
earned him an Academy Award nomination.
   Garner also looks good on a horse, something that never hurt
Ronald Reagan, said Rosenthal. The former president's first general
election victory was in the 1966 California gubernatorial race.
   Rosenthal said he began looking for a ``non-politician''
candidate after deciding that state Attorney General John Van de
Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein weren't likely
to beat Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who has declared his candidacy.

   The government acknowledged today that
Vietnamese asylum-seekers have complained of rough treatment by
police guarding their detention center and promised a thorough
investigation.
   The police assaults, first brought to light by the U.N. agency
for refugees, allegedly occurred during a weekend disturbance at
the Sek Kong detention center, where more than 7,000 Vietnamese are
kept in tents.
   They are among the 50,000 Vietnamese languishing in this British
colony after fleeing their Communist hommeland by boat.
   Authorities claim the violence began when about 200 Vietnamese
hurled stones Sunday night at guards who were trying to prevent
detainees from slipping through holes cut in the barbed wire
fencing around the camp. The unrest flared again several hours
later.
   Police originally said only four Vietnamese requested treatment
for injuries after the incident, including three who said they were
hurt accidentally. Police also said the death of a Vietnamese man
that night was not due to natural causes but provided no further
details.
   A police spokesman said today that the police have not received
any formal complaints since the unrest.
   However, Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said in a
statement today, ``There have been complaints from detainees of
unduly rough handling by the police. All allegations against the
government staff concerned will be fully and swiftly investigated.''
   The statement did not say how many complaints had been received,
although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees office
has said a ``considerable number'' of Vietnamese were injured.
   Robert Van Leeuwen, the head of the U.N. agency in Hong Kong,
told government-funded radio that similar incidents on a smaller
scale have occurred in the past at other centers where Vietnamese
are kept.
   ``Perhaps a more general look at the management of certain
centers would be in order,'' said Van Leeuwen, who was expected to
submit a report to Hong Kong authorities on complaints of police
behavior.
   The Vietnamese at Sek Kong are among the boat people who must
prove they fled political persecution or face repatriation.
   Local media have reported growing tension in the detention
centers amid signs that Britain and Vietnam are near agreement on a
program of forcefully repatriating boat people who do not qualify
as refugees.

<HEAD>House Democrats Push Flag-Burning Bill Instead of Amendment</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tops 13 grafs new with committee action; picks up at pvs 7th

<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats today pushed ahead with a bill
to ban flag burning after overruling Republican demands for a
constitutional amendment as the only way to overcome a Supreme
Court ruling legalizing that form of protest.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, squelched a GOP attempt to substitute an amendment for
his proposed statute outlawing desecration of the flag, including
burning, with penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine.
   Brooks ruled that the amendment, backed by President Bush and
offered by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was non-germane to the
committee's business today.
   ``Keeping the constitutional amendment from a vote is going to
come back soon enough to haunt those who made the decision,''
because a statute would never work, Sensenbrenner argued.
   Committee debate brought out strong views on both sides of the
issue.
   Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., said he thought the Supreme Court
was correct when it protected flag burning as a means of protest.
   It was only an issue in Congress, he said, because the flag was
used as a weapon by Bush in the 1988 campaign and Democrats were
``running scared whenever the question of the flag has been
raised.''
   But Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., said the American people were
demanding action and the Democrats claiming they were protecting
the First Amendment by blocking a constitutional amendment reminded
him of repression in Poland and Hungary.
   ``Those who scream First Amendment the loudest are the one's
shutting off debate,'' he said.
   The Democratic-controlled committee's meeting today was cut
short because the House Republican leadership has refused, unless a
constitutional amendment is also voted upon, to waive a rule
barring committees from voting on bills when any legislation is
being considered on the House floor.
   The panel was to resume its work Thursday.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and the other top
Democrats contend the statute can pass constitutional muster
because it doesn't take into account whether the flag burning or
other mutilation was part of a protest or similar act.
   Brooks' bill also makes an exception so that veterans groups and
others can continue to dispose of old, worn-out flags, for which
burning is the traditional method.
   The bill also provides for the law to get expedited review by
the Supreme Court, which started the political fire last month when
it threw out, by a 5-4 vote, a Texas statute against flag burning.
The court said the statute banned political expression, which is
protected by the Bill of Rights.
   The ruling was widely condemned by lawmakers in both parties,
but President Bush made it an intense political fight when he said
he would support only the constitutional amendment approach to
overcoming it.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that Bush
remained ``adamant'' in his belief that the flag should be
constitutionally protected.
   The Justice Department concluded that no simple statute could
accomplish the goals of those who want to protect the flag,
Fitzwater said.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on constitutional rights heard
testimony from the Justice Department and from scholars, including
Harvard University constitutional expert Laurence Tribe, who said
the court might OK a regular statute.
   The Democratic leadership has tentatively scheduled a vote on
the statute next week in the hope support for a constitutional
amendment will cool during Congress' August recess.
   The Senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and a
statute in October.

   Police arrested 74 people and seized scores of
weapons in Georgia's Abkhazia region, where tensions between rival
ethnic groups remain high, Tass said today. Two bombs exploded, but
no injuries were reported.
   Ethnic tension also was reported in the republic of Estonia,
where ethnic Russians stopped operations at 19 industrial plants to
protest legislation they say favors the ethnic Estonian majority,
strikers and news reports said.
   Tens of thousands of workers attended protest meetings this
morning, said Yaroslav Tolstikhov of Sovietskaya Estoniya, the
Communist Party daily in the Estonian capital, Tallinn.
   Abkhazia, in the southern republic of Georgia, has been the
scene of fighting between ethnic Abkhazians and native Georgians
since July 15. At least 21 people have been reported killed.
   ``The situation in Abkhazia and western Georgia is still
tense,'' Tass said. ``Unsanctioned meetings, involving 300 to 3,000
people, were held in Tbilisi, Chiatura and Akhaltsykha in the past
24 hours.''
   Tass said 70 people were detained for curfew violations Tuesday
and today and four others were arrested for taking part in illegal
demonstrations.
   Each side blames the other for the ethnic strife. Abkhazians,
who are a minority in the so-called autonomous region, want greater
economic independence and cultural rights, while the majority
Georgians want the fertile enclave, with its Black Sea resorts,
retained as part of the Georgian republic.
   Some Georgians also demand secession of the republic from the
Soviet Union, and thousands have been demonstrating daily in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, according to Tass and a Georgian
activist, Mamuk Tasagareli.
   Tasagareli, in a telephone interview, said 60,000 people
demonstrated there Tuesday night. Tass reported that 18,000 people
demonstrated in Tbilisi in favor of Georgian independence on Monday
night.
   About 30 major enterprises were on strike in Tbilisi, said
Tasagareli. His reports could not be independently confirmed.
   In Abkhazia, Tass said, police confiscated firearms stolen from
government security forces.
   ``A total of 199 firearms have been confiscated or surrendered
in the past 24 hours,'' the news agency said. It said 5,103 weapons
have been seized since the unrest began.
   The news agency said that on Tuesday, an explosive device was
thrown into the yard of a house belonging to D. Dolbadze, a teacher
at Gorky State University in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia.
   It also reported an explosion in the yard of a repair and
building organization. A truck was damaged, but there were no
injuries in either incident.
   Mass transit in Sukhumi, 880 miles south of Moscow, paralyzed
since the strife began, was partially restored, Pravda said.
   Radio and television broadcast funeral dirges Tuesday for those
who died in the violence and black bunting was draped from
government offices, the Communist Party daily reported.
   In Estonia, as many as 25,000 workers were reported off the job,
halting operations at enterprises from electronics plants to a
defense industry factory, said Yevgeny Kolekhnik, chairman of the
strike committee at the Baltic Shipyard in Tallinn, the Estonian
capital.
   The walkouts there began Tuesday.
   Strikers are complaining about a proposed law requiring that
people live in the republic two years before they can vote.
   They see the law as one more Estonian assertion of power. In
1988, thousands of ethnic Russians migrated to Estonia because the
republic enjoys a higher living standard than other parts of the
Soviet Union. Therefore, the law on voting primarily would affect
them.
   Estonia leads the drive in the 15 Soviet republics for greater
economic and political autonomy from Moscow.
   Estonians, who make up 65 percent of the republic's 1.6 million
people, have pushed through their parliament a law making Estonian
the official language, causing protests among Russians who comprise
28 percent of the population.
   It was unclear whether the national parliament would allow the
proposed election law to stand.
   The Estonian strike escalated as coal miners began ending a
series of strikes that began July 11.
   Miners began returning to work late last week after officials
agreed to most of their demands, including increases in deliveries
of meat and soap and rights to share management of their industry.
   Coal Ministry officials said Tuesday that 79 mines remained
idle, most in the Donetsk basin, 550 miles south of Moscow in the
Ukraine, Tass reported.

<TEXT>
   Entrepreneur Steve Rubell, the Studio 54
co-owner who presided over New York nightlife when disco was at its
peak, died early today at age 45.
   Rubell died in a Manhattan hospital of complications from
hepatitis and septic shock, said his publicist, Dan Klores.
   Rubell and partner Ian Schrager became the crown princes of
Manhattan nightlife when they operated Studio 54 in the late 1970s,
luring Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Liz Taylor, Liza Minnelli and a
slew of celebrities to their exclusive club.
   Rubell worked the door of the club after its April 26, 1977,
opening, deciding who would and would not be admitted. During those
heady days, he failed to recognize John Kennedy Jr. and Warren
Beatty, sending both away.
   Rubell and Schrager's reign was cut short by a 1979 conviction
for tax evasion. In January 1980, they were sentenced to 3{ years
in prison. By turning in several other club owners, they reduced
their sentences and were released from an Alabama prison a year
later.
   They sold Studio 54 soon afterward and channeled their efforts
into the hotel business. Within four years of their prison release,
Rubell and Schrager were operating Morgans hotel in Manhattan and
running another nightclub, the Palladium.
   Once again, Rubell became a fixture in the club scene. Opening
night at the Palladium attracted singer Boy George, actor Matt
Dillon and other celebrities.
   The partners also continued their hotel work, renovating and
reopening the Royalton hotel in midtown Manhattan. They also were
renovating a hotel off Times Square and had purchased a third on
the East Side.
   Rubell is survived by his father, Philip, and mother, Ann; his
brother, Donald, and sister-in-law, Mera; and a niece and nephew. A
private funeral service will be held Thursday.

<HEAD>Military Rulers Said to Have Released Nearly 4,000 Criminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers have released
nearly 4,000 convicted criminals under a recent government amnesty,
the state newspaper reported today.
   Under an amnesty announced July 20, death sentences were
commuted to life imprisonment, life sentences were reduced to 10
years, and other punishments were cut by two-thirds. The order said
criminal cases still being heard are to be closed.
   The amnesty applies only to those who committed offenses before
Sept. 18 1988, the day the military moved to crush a nationwise
pro-democracy uprising. It does not apply to cases of high treason
or breaches of martial law stipulations imposed since then.
   Martial law is aimed at preventing an upsurge of popular
discontent against authoritarian rule similar to that seen last
year. Gatherings of more than five people are forbidden, and
freedom of speech is greatly curtailed.
   On July 18, the eve of a planned opposition rally, the military
tightened martial law and threatened death sentences for offenders.
   In five days since the amnesty was announced, the Working
People's Daily, the English-language edition of the only legal
newspaper in Burma, said 3,944 prisoners had been released.
   A total of 155 people on death row at the time of the
announcement had been given reprieves, the paper said.
   The amnesty was announced the same day the military put under
house arrest the country's two leading opposition figures, Aung San
Suu Kyi and Tin Oo of the National League for Democracy. It accused
them of ``attempting to destroy the military and create anarchy in
the country.''
   A British Embassy spokesman in Bangkok said today that Michael
Aris, the British husband of Ms. Suu Kyi, is under effective house
arrest with her.
   Burma's foreign minister, Ohn Kyaw, denied that Aris was under
detention but said he was not permitted to see British Embassy
officials under the terms of his wife's house arrest.
   ``He (Aris) is under house arrest as far as we are concerned.
His liberty is being curtailed. Maybe he is only under half house
arrest but that is like being only slightly pregnant,'' he said. He
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with British custom.
   The spokesman said the Foreign Office had summoned the Burmese
ambassador in London and ``protested strongly'' about the treatment
of Aris.
   ``How can they forbid a British subject with a valid visa for
Burma to see someone from the embassy in Rangoon. He is a British
subject and he has every right to go to the embassy,'' the
spokesman said.
   The Foreign Office said Britain's charge d'affaires had been
prevented from seeing Aris, an Oxford University professor and
expert on Tibet, since he arrived at Rangoon airport Saturday.

   A three-alarm fire destroyed the
historic but shuttered El Mirador hotel today, fire officials said.
   The fire broke out shortly after midnight with flames licking
through the roof of the vacant structure, said Robert Morgan,
spokesman for the Palm Springs Fire Department.
   Cathedral City and Riverside County firefighters also responded
to the blaze. The cause of the fire was under investigation, Morgan
said.
   The Mirador, built in 1927, was owned by the Desert Hospital,
which uses its tower as a logo. Morgan said the hospital had
planned to restore the 200-room building to its original
Morrocan-Spanish design.
   A damage estimate was not immediately available, Morgan said.

<HEAD>Lonetree Accuses Lawyers Of Using Case For Publicity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Marine ever convicted of espionage
has accused his former lawyers, including civil rights attorney
William Kunstler, of keeping him in the dark about government
offers to plea bargain.
   In an appeal asking for a new trial or a reduction in Sgt.
Clayton J. Lonetree's 25-year sentence, new attorneys for the St.
Paul native have accused Kunstler and co-counsel William Stuhff of
ignoring plea-bargain overtures. They contend the attorneys hoped
to continue the case as a forum for publicity to embarrass the
military.
   The appeal was filed with the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of
Military Review one week ago but has not been publicized until now,
the Star-Tribune reported today.
   Lonetree, who was a guard at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was
convicted in 1987 of providing floor plans of the embassy to the
Soviet Union in a sex-for-secrets deal. He was sentenced to 30
years, later reduced to 25 years.
   Lonetree fired Kunstler and Stuhff after his conviction.
   ``If it helps the client, they can say anything they want about
the lawyers,'' Kunstler said Tuesday. ``I almost wish they were
right.'' Kunstler said he cannot recall any government offers that
were not communicated to Lonetree.
   The appeal claims Lonetree was not told by Kunstler or Stuhff
that, early in the case, the government would have agreed to a
five-to-10-year sentence in return for cooperation.
   The appeal, filed by Washington lawyers Lee Calligaro and Daniel
Johnson, also said a military attorney representing Lonetree was
rebuffed by Kunstler and Stuhff when he sought to pursue
plea-bargaining negotiations before trial.
   Stuhff said the appeal's characterization of his efforts on
Lonetree's behalf are ``completely dishonest.'' He said plea
bargaining was aggressively pursued, the government never offered
to settle for as little as five years, and Lonetree was informed of
all offers.

   A United Airlines pilot declared ``there
is no hero'' in the fiery DC-10 crash in which survivors
outnumbered fatalities, and said he learned a new way of flying in
the final minutes of Flight 232.
   ``It was just a group of four people who did their job,'' said
Capt. Al Haynes, in his first public comments since the July 19
crash. ``It was an unusual circumstance but we put our best
resources and knowledge together and did what we felt was best.''
   Haynes said the flight crew never doubted the stricken jetliner
would make it to Sioux Gateway Airport, where the jetliner
crash-landed short of a runway, flipped and broke apart. Of the 296
aboard, 185 people survived.
   ``We must not forget that 111 people perished in this accident.
This crew ... is dedicated to finding the cause of this accident so
we can maybe never have it happen again,'' said Haynes, a 33-year
United pilot.
   Later, he and his wife, Darlene, flew home to Seattle to
applause and hugs from family and neighbors outside their small
yellow house a few blocks east of Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   ``It's just great to be home,'' the 57-year-old pilot told a
crowd of reporters outside. ``If you can give me a few days, maybe
we can all get together and talk about this.''
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said, however, it might be a month
or more before the crew would give any interviews.
   At Tuesday's news conference, Haynes said he heard a ``very loud
report'' as the DC-10 flew over northwest Iowa on a flight from
Denver to Philadelphia via Chicago. He immediately began shutting
down the jetliner's No. 2 tail-mounted engine.
   ``It was very shortly after this that we realized we had more
than just an engine failure,'' said Haynes. ``It was apparent to us
that we had lost all of our hydraulic fluid.''
   When he asked flight engineer Dudley Dvorak ``for the procedure
for that, he said there isn't one. So we made it up as we went
along,'' Haynes said.
   The hydraulic systems allow pilots to set key wing and tail
panels that control the DC-10's altitude and direction. Without
them, the pilot has little control over the airplane other than his
throttles.
   Aviation experts have credited Haynes with keeping the craft
aloft until he reached the airport, where hundreds of emergency
workers were waiting.
   Asked about passengers who characterized him as a hero, Haynes
said: ``I'm not so sure I know how to answer that. There is no
hero.''
   Haynes appeared with Dvorak at the news conference, but United
officials said in advance that Dvorak would have no comments.
Dvorak, 51, returned home to Tacoma, Wash., on Tuesday.
   Haynes had scars from the crash on his face and hands in
addition to casts on his broken ankles. He appeared relaxed and
joked occasionally with the horde of reporters who showed up for
the hospital news conference.
   He wouldn't answer questions about details of the crash, his
suspicions of its cause and the reasons for his decisions, citing
the ongoing probe by the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Investigators are attempting to piece together the tail system
in an airport hangar. They theorize that pieces hurled from the
engine may have shattered the jets hydraulic lines. The probe,
however, has been hampered because key sections of the engine
haven't been found.
   Despite the damage to the aircraft, Haynes said, the thought of
a crash didn't enter his mind as he focused all his attention on
the stricken craft.
   ``I really didn't think about it,'' he said. ``We were just
going to go in and land and that's what we tried to do.
   Haynes also credited other crew members, co-pilot William R.
Records and Denny Fitch, an instructor pilot who works for United
but was a passenger on Flight 232. Records and Fitch remain
hospitalized.
   ``We became a four-man crew instead of a three-man crew,'' said
Haynes.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner said that nothing about the crash indicates that other
DC-10s are unsafe or that anything more now needs to be done to
make them safer. He defended new Federal Aviation Administration
head James Busey, who declared the DC-10 a safe aircraft even
though the cause of the crash has not been determined.
   NTSB inspector Jack Young arrived today at a General Electric
Co. jet engine plant in the Cincinnati suburb of Evendale to
examine the manufacturing records for the engine that blew apart.
The plant made all three of the DC-10's engines.

<HEAD>Violeta Chamorro Would Accept Presidential Nomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, editor of
the opposition newspaper La Prensa, says she will accept the
presidential nomination if she is chosen by a coalition of
opposition parties.
   The National Opposition Union, or UNO, a coalition of 14
opposition parties spanning the ideologial spectrum, was to meet
tonight to decide on a single opposition candidate.
   ``If UNO decides that I am the best candidate to win the battle
for democracy, I could not say no,'' Mrs. Chamorro said Tuesday
night.
   The opposition alliance, whose members include conservatives,
moderates and communists, will choose a candidate to challenge the
Sandinistas in the February 1990 presidential elections.
   Since coming to power in 1979, the Sandinistas have frequently
censored and closed the La Prensa daily and other opposition media.

<HEAD>Jury Picked for Trial of Reputed Cocaine Kingpin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed cocaine kingpin whose forced
extradition from Honduras last year sparked rioting in that country
is going on trial this week amid unusually tight security.
   Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 44, is accused of heading a
network that in seven months moved more than a ton of cocaine
valued at $70 million into the United States.
   According to his indictment, officials confiscated 114 pounds of
cocaine and $1.9 million in cash in one raid on the operation. He
was charged in April 1988 with conspiracy, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute and running a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   Attorneys selected a jury Tuesday in U.S. District Court. People
entering the courtroom had to pass through a metal detector added
for the case.
   Opening arguments were to begin Thursday before Judge Pamela A.
Rymer.
   Matta was arrested aboard a U.S.-bound plane in April 1988 after
he was whisked out of Honduras and taken to the Dominican Republic
by Honduran officials.
   The arrest touched off anti-U.S. rioting in Honduras. The
country's constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran citizens.
   U.S. marshals said an arrest warrant was issued for Matta after
he escaped from Florida's Eglin Federal Prison Camp in 1971. He had
been held there on charges of entering the United States with a
false passport.
   Matta refused to enter a plea at his arraignment, saying his
arrest violated his constitutional rights of due process. Martin
Stolar, his attorney, claimed Matta was tortured while in custody.
   Gurule said a medical examination confirmed that reasonable
force was used to subdue Matta, who resisted arrest. That force
included a hood placed over his head, secured with a cord around
his neck.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp today pledged not
to overlook his department's duties to the poor and elderly as he
tackles the ``Herculean task'' of cleaning up the scandal-plagued
agency.
   ``We are going to both clean up HUD and make it work while
moving forward on goals that Congress and President Bush have laid
out,'' Kemp told the House Select Committee on Aging during a
hearing on housing for the elderly.
   Alluding to recent allegations about fraud and
influence-peddling under his predecessor at HUD, Kemp said it was
appropriate that he address the aging committee because ``there is
no secretary in the Cabinet who is aging faster.''
   He pledged that ``as we go about the Herculean task of cleaning
out the Aegean stables ... I feel quite confident that we can move
forward on policy, programs, reports to meet the great goals of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.''
   On Tuesday, Kemp said in an interview on CBS-TV he believes
``there'll be some people that go to jail,'' and some ought to go
to jail for their roles in the scandal. He did not identify any
individuals he had in mind.
   Kemp said he was ``shocked at the extent'' the scandal ``reached
into the management of HUD'' in the previous administration.
   Kemp's predecessor, Samuel Pierce, won't have to return until
September to testify before a panel investigating alleged fraud and
influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Pierce had been scheduled to testify Aug. 3, but the House panel
investigating the HUD case granted an extension to give him more
time to prepare.
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, said in a letter
to Pierce he agreed to the delay ``based on your apparent
difficulty in retaining counsel to represent you at the
subcommittee hearing.''
   Pierce had been scheduled to face questions on his role in HUD
approval of more than $15 million in grants and subsidies for a
North Carolina project that was supported by a former law partner
of Pierce.
   In his prior appearance before the subcommittee, Pierce said he
took no direct role in HUD funding decisions.
   Since then, however, there have been a number of indications
that Pierce was more active in HUD projects than his testimony
indicated, including sworn testimony from a former HUD official who
said Pierce personally ordered her to approve funding for the North
Carolina project.
   Also on Tuesday, the Justice Department said it is sending two
attorneys to Denver to help federal prosecutors in Colorado
investigate cases of fraud against HUD.
   William C. Hendricks III, head of the department's fraud
section, said HUD fraud in Colorado is so extensive that a large
number of foreclosed properties on the market has depressed the
building market.
   Denver will become the second city where Washington-based fraud
prosecutors have been detailed to investigate HUD cases. Three
Justice Department prosecutors have been working for the past year
in Oklahoma City, assisting in the prosecution of HUD and
bank-fraud cases in Oklahoma.
   So far, the Oklahoma City task force has obtained 16 felony
convictions.
   Also, The New York Times reported today that HUD documents
provide the latest Republican luminary to be tied to HUD lobbying:
Former Sen. George Murphy of California lobbied on behalf of Boston
housing projects that later received millions of dollars in
assistance.
   The documents, the newspaper said, also show that Murphy
discussed potential business deals with former HUD official Deborah
Gore Dean, including a proposal for her to serve as a book agent on
his memoirs. Murphy was quoted as saying in an interview that the
book deal was not pursued and that his contacts with Ms. Dean were
proper.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   July 19
   The Item, Sumter, S.C., on the B-2 bomber:
   For taxpayers, the B-2 stealth bomber is the best and worst of
defense items. Even if production of the fleet of planes stays on
budget _ which is unlikely _ it is by far the most costly plane in
history. That's the bad news.
   Yet its promised capability to replace the U.S.'s aging
long-range bombers make it one of the key components to defending
America into the next century.
   Lines are being divided in Congress with most of the division
coming over the cost of the plane, not whether it is a reliable
deterrent to war.
   Unlike industry, which can do testing and market research in
private, U.S. defense is developed out in the open. That is how it
should be.
   But it unfortunately allows decisions to be based on factors
other than need. While the need for Star Wars defense has always
been open to debate, the need for a new bomber system is not.
   Congress should continue full funding for research and
development of the B-2, and be ready to fund it if the tests
results are positive.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   July 20
   Philadelphia Daily News on the B-2 bomber:
   The B-2 flew the other day. It didn't go far or fast, but it
flew.
   Under ordinary circumstances, this would not be impressive.
After all, the least a $500 million airplane should be able to do
is fly a little. But these are not ordinary times.
   Some people are presenting this unimpressive feat as vindication
of $22 billion already spent on the B-2 and an excuse to spend
another $70 billion.
   Jimmy Carter canceled the troubled B-1 program in 1980 on the
ground that we could wait for the B-2. Reagan decided to do both.
The B-1 works sometimes. The B-2 may never work. Neither has a
mission, at least one that makes any sense in the modern world.
   Instead of wasting more piles of money, it would be more useful
to revive the old idea of the Marshal Plan. Send all that B-2 money
to places like Poland and Hungary, where it can be put to use
curing a dreadful pollution problem and rebuilding an industrial
base.
   That would go a lot further toward ensuring the security of the
United States than a fleet of incredibly expensive warplanes with
no reason for existing.

   The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D., on campaign reform:
   At long last, a step has been taken in the right direction on
the issue of campaign reform.
   If President Bush has his way, most political action committee
contributions to Congress members would be eliminated, personal use
of campaign funds would be prohibited, and carrying over funds from
one campaign to the next would be barred. The proposal would also
mandate the disclosure of indirect campaign contributions called
``soft money.''
   Bush's bid is long overdue, and the public should be pleased
that steps are being taken to end the backstage financing of
Congress members.
   Money, says former Sen. Les AuCoin, D-Wis., is ``endangering the
form of government and the democracy we have,'' and he decries the
``endless ... virtual hourly pursuit of money'' by members of
Congress.
   And so do we.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on President Bush's clean air
bill:
   President Bush last week proposed a weaker air pollution bill
than he'd led Americans to expect.
   Last month, when ... Bush announced that he supported a tougher
federal clean air law and outlined what provisions he thought such
a law should have, he seemed ready to take on the nation's largest
pollution source: the car.
   But (his) proposal ... actually could increase auto pollution in
some regions. ...
   Bush at least is on board. And Congress is desirous of updating
the woefully inadequate Clean Air Act passed in 1977.
   Chances are good, in brief, that a better bill than ... Bush
proposed will come out of the congressional pipeline. ...
   The process is off to a good start.

   Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on protecting the environment:
   Environmentalism has come a long way in the last two decades.
Americans now generally accept the notion that society has a
responsibility to defend the environment just as it defends
citizens and the country.
   The business of defending against ecological crimes has become
much more intricate since the infancy of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Since the inception of the EPA's Office of Criminal
Investigations in 1982, the government has had considerable success
in catching polluters in the act. It has convicted 145 corporations
and 375 people.
   Up until recently, however, the effect of such convictions was
lessened by the fact that generally companies faced only fines,
since few of the crimes had felony status.
   However, in recent times Congress elevated violations of the
Clean Water Act and Superfund law to felony status, meaning prison
for the executives who oversee the crime.
   That's as it should be. When a company uses illegal dumping as a
practice and can afford to risk the fine levied against it, the
management will hardly be deterred. However, when its executives
know they can go to prison for illegal dumping, they will stop and
think.
   Americans have come to behold crimes against the environment as
crimes against themselves. It makes sense to have punishment that
fits such a crime.

   Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald on the space program:
   If America wants to lead the way in space exploration, as it
should, now is the time to start. ...
   On the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing July 20,
President Bush called on the United States to build a permanent
base on the moon in the next century and then to send explorers to
the planet Mars. These are worthy goals, and they can be met. But
they can't be met the way things are going now. ...
   The government in the 1960s could afford an ambitious space
program. Today it can't. ...
   A space program to colonize the moon and strike out for the
planets might cost around _ to take a wild guess _ $100 billion a
year to start. ...
   Bush, Congress and the American people ought to make up their
minds to overcome the present hurdles and to tackle this project.
   To start, tens of billions of dollars going to the Pentagon for
expensive and unlikely-to-work weapons should be diverted to NASA
instead.
</TEXT>

   July 21
   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on the space program:
   The question is not whether America should renew and extend its
commitment to space exploration. It must do so.
   The essential questions are about the priority this commitment
should have, relative to other national purposes, and about the
goals the program should accomplish.
   A manned flight to Mars, as suggested by President Bush, would
be a challenge equal to the moon flight. But the $30 billion cost
would be staggering, and a project of that magnitude should require
more specific justification than the desire to demonstrate our
virtuosity in space.
   What are the specific scientific goals? What are the practical
benefits, either now or in the future?
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should not
have the last word on such a project. It is a vast bureaucracy that
needs an new mission to justify future expansion.
   The president and Congress should consult the best scientific
minds in the country before making irrevocable decisions on the
issues.
   It would profit us little to conquer Mars while losing our base
on Earth to poverty, crime and pollution.
   A sense of proportion is needed, as well as the desire for
adventure and discovery in space.

   The Seattle Times on offshore drilling:
   To hear Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. tell it, the answer
to the nation's energy needs lies ``just several miles off our
shores and in Alaska.''
   Since imported oil accounts for a significant part of the
country's total energy requirements, Lujan said, we're still
vulnerable to a paralysis like the one created by the Arab oil
embargo of the 1970s.
   The speech gave off disturbing signs that the Bush
administration is no more sensitive than its predecessor to the
serious environmental issues involved in expanding offshore
drilling in areas such as Alaska's Arctic National Refuge and
fragile sections of the Washington and Oregon coasts.
   Lujan's remarks also signified that the administration is
totally out of touch with the hot anger still being felt by most
Americans over the oil spill outrages of recent months. ...
   Lujan is right to remind Americans that the nation's domestic
energy suppliers do not meet demand. But a long-term solution to
the problems of U.S. dependence on foreign oil will be found
elsewhere _ a greater emphasis on conservation, for example.
   The Bush administration ought to be more aggressive in
stiffening the timetable for fuel-efficient vehicles and
encouraging a faster search for environmentally safe alternatives
to the burning of fossil fuels.

   The Leaf-Chronicle, Clarksville, Tenn., on changing U.S. coins:
   Does Abraham Lincoln need a ``facelift''?
   The image of Mr. Lincoln, as well as of the other former
presidents who appear on the obverse of U.S. coins, will be
revamped if Congress has its way. The flip side of the coins will
be completely changed.
   The director of the U.S. Mint, Donna Pope, testified before a
House committee that she hasn't heard any demand from the public
that the coins be altered. In fact, she said that the only people
who seem to be calling for new coins are coin collectors.
   Regardless, Congress appears ready to go ahead with the
redesign. Pending legislation would give the former presidents a
new look and replace the ``tails'' images of the Lincoln Memorial,
Monticello and the bald eagle with themes and freedoms guaranteed
in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
   Coins would continue to be the same size, weight, color and
metal content. All current inscriptions would also remain,
including ``In God We Trust.''
   Congressional supporters of the change have pointed out that
other Western countries alter their coinage every few years. In
contrast, Mr. Lincoln's face on the penny has been the same since
1909.
   Well, so what? With the United States falling behind some
nations in vital areas such as the production and export of
technology, should Congress be worrying about keeping up on pocket
change?
   In the end, the legislative debates promise to be time consuming
and the redesign procedure costly.
   To recoin a phrase: The penny's image saved is a penny earned.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside County, Calif., on the trade
deficit:
   Any way they're read, the trade statistics for the month of May
are not good news.
   The nation seems to be exporting its manufactures about as fast
as it can. In April, American exports amounted to $30.76 billion,
the most ever. And in May, they were off a bare 1 percent; call it
a wash.
   Going as fast as it can, the nation still lost ground like mad.
April's trade deficit of $8.29 billion may sound like a lot on its
face, but in fact it was the best month of the young year. In May,
it's now reported, the deficit puffed up to $10.24 billion.
   Imports were up on every front, but where consumers usually get
the blame, the fingerprints of American businessmen are all over
this deficit. Imports of capital goods, as opposed to consumer
goods, led the parade. ...
   It's one thing, the (experts') reasoning goes, to have consumers
splurging on VCRs, CDs and video cameras. There is a reasonable
expectation that binges like these have to end sooner or later.
   It's another thing to have businesses importing supplies and
equipment. That probably means that these materials are not being
made in this country; at least, not any more.
   That dovetails uncomfortably with the fact that a lot of popular
consumer electronic items no longer are made in America. That all
represents a competitive failure _ and nothing says that has to be
a temporary condition.

   The Tobacco Institute led all contributors of honoraria (special

   In addition, RJR@Nabisco, Philip Morris and the Smokeless

$138,000.
   These are representatives of the same government that tells us
smoking is the chief avoidable cause of death _ the same government
supposedly worried about the thousands who want to kick the habit,
but can't.
   It's a betrayal of public health.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on raising taxes:
   The House Ways and Means Committee, which every year gets the
first chance to tell Americans how heavily they will be taxed the
year after, is having a hard time keeping its eyes on the target.
   It is true that taxpayers might applaud the committee if it does
not pass a tax bill at all _ but the members do have a job, and
they should do it.
   Yet, rather than addressing such issues as capital gains tax
cuts and reductions in the levy on the retired elderly for
catastrophic health insurance, the panel has voted $16 billion to
fund a child-care bill yet to be enacted.
   The tax panel has already spent a lot of time finding taxes and
fees to increase _ that is, slicing the sausage thinly in order not
to alarm President Bush who, during the presidential campaign,
pledged to hold the line.
   Until the Democrats on Capitol Hill face up to the election
returns, talk of comity in Congress will remain largely rhetorical,
disguising policy differences that eventually will explode if the
voters' message is spurned.

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe on the cause of the Alaska oil spill:
   A 110-page report to the National Transportation Safety
Commission by Alaska concludes that poor management by Exxon
Shipping Co. was responsible for the nation's worst oil spill when
the Exxon Valdez went aground March 24 in Alaska's Prince William
Sound.
   In fact, said the man who headed the state's inquiry, management
lapses and failures were so numerous ``that it is a wonder the
Exxon Valdez was the first tanker grounded.''
   That condemnation should come as no surprise. It was apparent in
the first hours after the tanker struck the reef and began losing
11 million gallons of oil that no one really had any idea of what
to do. Vital equipment reportedly was out of service. Emergency
plans for dealing with a spill of such magnitude were either
nonexistent or fantasy. ...
   Oil spills simply must not be considered a risk of doing
business. Congress must ensure that the oil companies have in place
the methods and means for handling future calamities as well as for
preventing them, and Exxon Shipping Co. and Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co. must be required to pay dearly for their failures.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the Oregon lottery:
   Starting in September, Oregon will sell betting sheets. People
can try their luck at picking the winning teams each week in the
NFL. State officials say they expect their take to be $4 million to
$9 million annually, which would then go to support athletic
programs at the state's universities and colleges.
   But before Oregon starts counting its source of revenue, it
would be wise to take another look at its odds for success. Smart
money says the NFL will file a lawsuit ... (which) is likely to
involve years of costly delays.
   Then there is the matter of bookies. For one thing, they pay a
higher return than the state, and they never ask bettors to report
their winnings to the Internal Revenue Service. The football
lottery may be something less than a smash hit with the public.
   Some bettors will like the convenience of one stop shopping that
allows them to pick up butter, eggs, and the Seattle Seahawks at
plus three points at the local supermarket. But is this really the
best way to fund college sports? Not by a long shot.

<HEAD>Investigation Into Arsenic Poisonings Expands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of alleged arsenic
poisonings by a woman charged with killing her former husband and a
boyfriend has expanded to eight cases.
   Detectives have added the deaths of three acquaintances to the
probe of Blanche Taylor Moore, 56, police Lt. Steve Lynch revealed
Tuesday.
   The retired grocery clerk is charged with murder in the 1973
death of her first husband, James Taylor, and in the 1986 death of
her boyfriend, Raymond Reid. She is charged with assault in the
arsenic poisoning of her present husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore,
54, who is under treatment.
   Mrs. Moore, who is scheduled for arraignment Aug. 28, says she
is innocent.
   Investigators previously disclosed they were looking into the
1966 death of Mrs. Moore's father, Parker Kiser, and that of a
longtime co-worker, Mabel Parsons, who died in 1988 at age 61.
   Added to the list of deaths under investigation were those of
Joseph Mitchell, Ina Vinson and John Reiber, all Burlington
residents described by Lynch as acquaintances of Mrs. Moore.
   Refusing to provide details, Lynch said his department was
conducting a preliminary inquiry into the death of Mitchell, a
grocery store butcher whose death in July 1985 was attributed to
arterial hypertension and lack of blood to the brain stem.
   Mitchell's wife, Anne, said that prior to her husband's death,
his hands and feet were numb and surgery to restore the feeling was
unsuccessful. Numbness is a symptom of arsenic poisoning.
   Ms. Vinson, 74, a retired Southern Bell worker, died Aug. 24,
1977, at her home of heart failure, according to her death
certificate.
   Reiber, 77, was a retired hosiery mill worker and a member of
the church at which Mrs. Moore's husband preached. Reiber died Feb.
12, 1988, in his home. His death certificate cites heart failure
and says his condition became acute one to two weeks before his
death.

<TEXT>
   A chemical fire in a derailed tanker car
burned into a fifth day today after firefighters failed to snuff
it, and an estimated 1,000 residents were forced to spend another
night away from home.
   Officials decided to let the fire burn itself out after attempts
on Tuesday to smother it with sodium bicarbonate powder were
unsuccessful, said a Tittabawassee Township Fire Department
dispatcher, who refused to give his name.
   Authorities met again this morning to discuss whether there is
any way to get the fire out quicker. They have said they cannot
predict how long it will burn because they don't know how much
chemical the car contained.
   The car has been burning since a train owned by CSX
Transportation Inc. derailed around midday Saturday about 90 miles
northwest of Detroit.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, four cars of another CSX train derailed in
Chatham, Ontario, about 80 miles east of Detroit, police said.
Authorities evacuated about 400 residents from a 1-square-mile area
as they unloaded butane and propane gas from the tankers, none of
which were ruptured.
   In Freeland, at least 3,000 people were forced to evacuate
initially, but most of them were allowed to return Monday when the
evacuation zone around the accident site was reduced from 15 square
miles to 4 square miles.
   The area wouldn't be decreased further until the chemical
chlorosilene in the car burned off and two other derailed cars
containing toxic plastic ingredients are removed, CSX spokesman R.
Lindsay Leckie said.
   The other cars remained near the burning car, but neither was
leaking or burning, Leckie said.
   Hydrochloric acid fumes from the burning chlorosilene were
dissipating in the air, CSX officials said.
   Officials have reported no serious injuries from the accident,
but many residents have experienced eye and skin irritation.
   Four people were released from St. Luke's Hospital in nearby
Saginaw following treatment Monday for eye and skin irritation and
nausea, hospital spokeswoman Sally Meter said.
   Alex J. Sagady, environmental health expert with the American
Lung Association of Michigan, said elderly people and those with
asthma or other respiratory problems had the greatest risk of
problems from the fumes.
   ``It was like spraying Raid in your face,'' said Tina Hartung,
recalling the sensation as she was hustled from her home 10 minutes
after the derailment. ``You could smell it. You could taste it.''
   One of the train's derailed cars jumped the tracks twice in
April, had brake problems and recently left service for repairs,
Jim Burnett of the National Safety Transportation Board said.
   ``This car has had two previous derailments on the CSX railroad.
I don't know what its accident experience may have been on other
railroads,'' Burnett said of the car, which is owned by the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe rail line.

   District of Columbia police ordered two dozen
women to walk more than a mile from a downtown street frequented by
prostitutes to the Virginia line, and lawmakers from the state are
not amused.
   ``This is the fourth commodity the district exports to Virginia.
We get all the sludge, all the garbage, most of the prisoners and
now their prostitutes,'' said Republican Rep. Stan Parris, a
frequent critic of how the nation's capital is governed.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., went to the Senate floor today to
denounce the predawn Tuesday incident as ``an indignity to the
Commonwealth of Virginia.'' He demanded that district Mayor Marion
Barry investigate the circumstances surrounding the police action
and discipline those involved in ``this incredible, almost
unbelievable episode, in law enforcement.''
   District Deputy Police Chief Edward J. Spurlock said Tuesday
that he would investigate the incident.
   ``It's definitely not something I would approve,'' he said. ``It
sounds awful bizarre to me. I assure you that's not the kind of
thing we encourage.''
   Police spokesman Reginald L. Smith added, ``This is not standard
operating practice. ... It is not a sanctioned effort.'' The
commanders of two police districts also denied their officers were
responsible for the forced march.
   The angry women were rounded up about 1:30 a.m Tuesday and
forced to walk through the business district and across the Mall.
   ``They said they were taking us to Virginia, that we could work
over there,'' said a woman who identified herself as a prostitute
named Toni. ``They said we'd go to jail if we stopped.''
   Police, who escorted the women with flashing lights on their
squad cars, made no arrests.
   A Washington Post reporter and photographer recorded the
incident.
   Half an hour after the march, most of the women had returned to
the Washington street corners police had ordered them to leave.

<HEAD>Suspects Nabbed After Asking Police To Send A Cab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBERTY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men have been arrested after they
mistakenly called police instead of the cab company they needed for
their getaway after allegedly comitting a burglary.
   ``We don't know how or why they called the Liberty Police
Department unless they knew they were being chased by police and
dialed it subconsciously,'' said Chief Edward Eisely.
   He said police received a report Tuesday that someone had been
robbed of $40 by two men.
   Shortly after the dispatcher alerted local taxi companies, a man
called, saying he needed a cab right away for a ride to Loch
Sheldrake, a village 3 miles away.
   The dispatcher ``advised them that they ... were talking to the
police department _ and they immediately hung up,'' Eisely said.
   Cab companies were again notified, and police followed and
stopped a taxi that picked the suspects up, Eisely said.
   The two men were charged with second-degree burglary.
   ``The only other time I can think of something like this
happening was a few years ago in New York City when these guys
tried to rob a bank during FBI payday,'' Eisely said. ``They asked
the teller for money, and they heard about 15 guns clicking behind
them.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 65-mile-per-hour speed limit adopted for
some rural interstate highways caused 550 additional deaths last
year, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said today.
   In a report to Congress, the institute said highways with the
higher limit had a 30 percent increase in fatalities _ twice the
increase recorded by the institute and the Transportation
Department for 1987.
   Brian O'Neill, president of the research institute, which is
financed by insurance companies, said states that kept the maximum
speed limit at 55 mph had no significant increase in road deaths.
   The speed has been increased to 65 on rural interstate highways
in 38 states. Maximum speed elsewhere has remained 55 mph for 15
years.
   O'Neill said the conclusion that fatalities had increased 30
percent on roads where the speed limit had been increased was based
on an institute analysis of Transportation Department highway
fatality records. The department has not released its own
interpretation of the data.
   ``It's a much greater increase in deaths than would have been
expected if speed limits hadn't been changed,'' O'Neill told a
Science, Space and Technology Committee transportation subcommittee.

<HEAD>Americans Arrested for Allegedly Smuggling Marijuana into Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Wednesday they have arrested two
Americans on charges of using U.S. military mail to smuggle into
Japan two pistols, 125 cartridges and 9.9 pounds of marijuana
valued at $158,000.
   Police also have arrested another American and three Japanese
for allegedly buying the drugs and pistols, smuggled from the
Philippines, authorities said.
   Air Force Sgt. Robert N. Barber, 27, and Edwin M. Griffin Jr.,
34, a former serviceman, bought the drugs and pistols while in
training or on private visits in the Philippines.
   Barber then mailed the items to his base, Kadena Air Base in
Okinawa, through a U.S. military base in the Philippines, according
to a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Japanese police investigators first arrested Joji Heshiki, 40, a
Japanese restaurant manager in Naha, Okinawa, for allegedly
possessing marijuana and used information from Heshiki to arrest
two other Japanese and the third American, identified as U.S. Air
Force Senior Airman Wayne K. Wickliffe, the official said.
   Wickliffe also is assigned to Kadena, the official said, but
declined to disclose the hometowns of the three Americans.
   U.S. military spokesman Marine Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues said
he could not confirm the report immediately because of the late
hour Wednesday night.
   The maximum penalty for smuggling marijuana into Japan is seven
years in prison and that for violation of the weapons control law
is 10 years in prison.

   A vagrant suspected in the fatal
shootings of a bus driver and passenger Sunday was arrested today
in Nebraska after diving for a gun when officers awoke him in a
stolen car, police said.
   Joseph Alexander Besaraba, 44, was asleep in a parked car off
Interstate 80 near Brule, Neb., when officers approached to inspect
the car.
   Beseraba was asked to get out of the car while officers ran a
license check, and they learned the vehicle had been stolen in
Florida.
   As officers took him into custody, Hollywood police spokesman
David Steele said, Beseraba dove into the car to reach for a gun.
The officers subdued him, found identification in the car and took
him to jail.
   Two Hollywood detectives left today for Nebraska to interview
Beseraba, a naturalized American citizen from Ballendorf, West
Germany.
   He was charged in a Florida arrest warrant with boarding a
municipal bus in Hollywood Sunday and fatally shooting the driver
and a passenger with a 9mm pistol.
   The gunman commandeered a getaway car and critically wounded its
driver, Scott Yaguda, 31, of Alexandria, Va. Yaguda was in stable
condition today with gunshots to his back and legs, said Memorial
Hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Wine.
   Beseraba was found sleeping in Yaguda's car, Steele said.
   Police said they have not determined a motive for the shootings.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have found human bones near a large ``SOS''
spelled out with white birch branches on a mountain in northern
Japan, officials said Wednesday.
   Two people have been reported missing since 1984 in climbs on
7,514-foot Mount Asahidake, said Sgt. Koichi Kasahara, a spokesman
for police on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido.
   He said he wouldn't dismiss the possibility a climber in
distress set out the ``SOS'' and died before any help arrived.
   He said the SOS was seen Monday by the crew of a police
helicopter searching for another missing climber. Rescuers said the
SOS arrangement looked old, with some of the birch buried in dirt
or grass, he added.
   The subject of Monday's search _ a climber from Tokyo _ was
rescued by the helicopter about 2 miles from the distress sign,
halfway up the mountain. But he told his rescuers he knew nothing
of the English SOS letters, each measuring about 16 feet long and
10 feet wide.
   On Tuesday, Kasahara said, the helicopter returned to Asahidake
in central Hokkaido and set down four searchers who found human
bones and a knapsack, containing a tape recorder, a towel, soap and
other articles, near the SOS.
   Kasahara said police were examining the bones and belongings to
determine the victim's identity. None of the articles carried any
names or initials, he added.

   Three horses that escaped from a pasture when
someone unlatched a gate led police on a hair-raising ride against
traffic on busy highways before stopping to graze with other horses.
   ``We had the horses going one way at 30 to 35 mph, and cars
going 55 mph the other way,'' Lakewood police Sgt. Ernie Wolf said.
``It really showed how Denver drivers can react, and I was really
impressed.''
   The horses _ two geldings and a mare valued at $13,000 _ led
police and animal-control wardens from Denver and suburban Lakewood
around a 7{-mile loop Tuesday until they finally were captured 2{
miles from their pasture.
   The horses wandered to a busy intersection, ran eastbound on
westbound lanes. Police cleared the freeway ahead of the horses to
Interstate 25, where the horses headed north in the southbound
lanes.
   Police managed to direct them onto a service road, and they
finally were herded onto a street.
   One horse fell, giving pursuers a chance to collar him. The
other two continued west until they saw other horses grazing in a
field and joined them.
   The animals' owner was cited with three counts of animals
running at large.

   Highway workers have posted a road
sign to warn motorists of a haunting hazard: ghosts crossing.
   The red and white triangular sign, illustrated with a specter,
warns drivers of a supernatural hazard some workers say exists
along a southern Norway secondary road, near a highway department
cabin, reports said Wednesday.
   ``Some of our people have experienced so many strange things at
the cabin that they swear there are ghosts in the area,'' state
highway department spokesman Geir Hasle told the Norwegian news

   The cabin, formerly used by highway watchmen, is reputed to be
the site of many unexplained incidents.
   Hasle said the sign, which meets national standards, was made by
the highway office to mark the 100th anniversary of the Geiranger
Highway. The idea wasn't cleared with the highway department main
office, he said.
   ``The road isn't used much anymore so we didn't see any problem
with posting the sign,'' Hasle told Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang.

   The United Auto Workers and Nissan made
last-minute appeals to 2,400 workers, and both sides prdicted
victory today in balloting to decide if their plant will become the
first union shop owned solely by a Japanese automaker.
   The UAW aired radio commercials Tuesday echoing its theme that
the fast work pace at Nissan has increased injuries.
   ``The significance to us has to do with the problems that Nissan
employees have. They're suffering a very brutal line speed and high
injury rate,'' union spokesman Maxey Irwin said.
   The company has disputed this, although it drew a $5,000 fine
from Tennessee authorities _ now under appeal _ for refusing to
show its injury log to a group of workers.
   Nissan, meanwhile, reportedly warned workers on closed-circuit
videos that UAW representation could mean a loss of benefits for
production line workers.
   At a news conference today arranged by Nissan, anti-union
employees predicted the UAW would be defeated.
   ``I think it's going to go fairly heavily for the plant against
the union _ maybe 75 percent,'' Ken Roden, a 28-year-old worker in
the trim and chassis department.
   UAW organizer Jim Weaver had the opposite view.
   ``I think it really looks great. The momentum's building. And
people were coming out of the plant all excited this morning,''
Weaver said.
   The company has declined to talk publicly about the campaign.
``We don't want to conduct this election in the media,'' President
Jerry Benefield said earlier this month.
   Benefield addressed about half of the plant's work force
Tuesday. Pro-union workers said the speech was interrupted with
chants of ``Union! Union!'' They added that some employees gave
Benefield a standing ovation.
   The speech was closed to reporters, and Nissan officials
declined to comment on it.
   Workers at Nissan Motor Manufacturing Co. U.S.A.'s
auto-and-truck plant south of Nashville were to begin voting today
in an election that's crucial for the UAW.
   Reflecting an overall decline in union strength, UAW membership
has fallen from more than 1.5 million in the late 1970s to about 1
million today. Hopes of stopping the decline rest largely with the
growing number of plants operated by Japanese automakers.
   The union has organized workers in three joint ventures _ a
Mazda-Ford plant in Flat Rock, Mich., run by Mazda Motor Corp.; the
New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. factory in Fremont, Calif., a
venture of General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.; and the
Diamond-Star Motors Corp. plant in Bloomington, Ill., a venture of
Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   But workers at Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., plant, at Honda Motor
Corp.'s Marysville, Ohio, facility and at Nissan's Smyrna plant
aren't unionized.
   An effort to organize the Honda plant failed badly three years
ago, and labor observers say another defeat could cripple UAW hopes.
   Voting at Smyrna is scheduled to end early Thursday.
   Union spokesman Irwin played down the vote's importance.
   ``Within the UAW, it's not a question of if Nissan or the other
Japanese assembly plants ... will be organized,'' Irwin said
Tuesday. ``It is simply a question of when they will be organized.''
   Nissan's messages to workers reportedly blamed the union for
layoffs at General Motors and promised tough negotiations if the
UAW wins.
   The Nashville Banner reported today that it obtained an audio
copy of a company tape in which a voice says that a UAW victory
would mean the company would have to negotiate with the union, not
the workers.
   ``Who wins in negotiations is usually decided by who is in the
strongest position. So at Nissan you start out knowing the company
will not be easy in bargaining,'' the tape said.
   The tape also said employees should be concerned about strikes
and that a strike could hurt them more than it could Nissan.
Television reports of strike violence and unsuccessful strikes are
included in the videotape, the newspaper reported.
   Union spokesman Frank Joyce said the tape was an inaccurate
attempt to intimidate Nissan workers.
   ``The idea that somehow Nissan is currently in a bargaining
relationship on an individual basis with workers is pretty absurd.
Nissan employees do not set their own wages, benefits or working
conditions,'' Joyce said. ``If they want to declare in advance that
they will be hard to bargain with, we're used to that.''

   DAT equipment uses the same digital technology employed by
compact disc players, resulting in recordings that are close to

fear that they could be used to make high-quality copies of CDs and
damage their sales.
   The sources, who spoke Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said
U.S., European and Japanese record and electronics industry groups
had agreed on an international standard that would allow sales of
DAT recorders that can make a direct digital recording from a
digital source such as a CD.
   But the DAT machines would not be able to make copies of the
copy, the sources said, because of an inaudible electronic signal
added to the tape by the DAT recorder. Such protection would
prevent the multiple creation of low-cost pirate copies of
expensive CDs.
   The accord will be publicized on Thursday through press releases
and private briefings, Trish Heimers, a spokeswoman for the
Recording Industry Association of America in Washington, said
today. She declined to give any details in advance.
   Represented in the working group that reached the agreement are
15 Japanese and European manufacturers; the Washington-based
Electronic Industries Association; and two recording industry trade
groups, the Recording Industry Association of America and the
London-based International Federation of Phonographic Industries,
according to Ron Petty, a Sony Corp. of America spokesman in Park
Ridge, N.J.
   The copy protection system is one devised by NV Philips of the
Netherlands and known as Solo, said Albert Ruttner, a vice
president of North American Philips Corp. in New York.
   It is expected to take several months for the manufacturers to
add the copy-protection circuitry to the machines and bring the
devices to market.
   DAT machines are now being sold in Japan and parts of Europe.
But the equipment currently on the market cannot make direct
digital recordings from CDs. They must convert the digital signals
first into analog mode and then reconvert them to digital,
resulting in a slight audio degradation.
   The sources said the industry groups plan to apply to their
governments for approval of DAT sales under the new standard.
   Japanese electronics makers, which manufacture most DAT
equipment, have refrained from actively selling DAT machines in the
United States because of opposition from the U.S. record industry.
   The agreement is expected to result in the beginning of
widespread U.S. sales, but the sources said they did not know
exactly when marketing would start.

<HEAD>Norwegian DC-10 Survivor Fights Fear, Flies Back to Oslo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Norwegian student who survived the DC-10
crash in Sioux City, Iowa, had vowed to take a boat home but
changed her mind and arrived by plane Wednesday.
   ``The flight home cured some of my fear, but there's still some
left,'' Gitte Skaanes told the Norwegian news agency NTB upon her
arrival from New York. She said she might even become a flight
attendant.
   Miss Skaanes spent a year in Cheyenne, Wyo. as an exchange
student. She suffered only a bump on the head July 19 when the
United Airlines DC-10 crashed while trying to make an emergency
landing in Sioux City.
   Of the 296 passengers, 185 survived. Miss Skaanes turned 18 the
day after the crash and called her survival a birthday gift.
   For several days after the accident, Miss Skaanes said she would
take a boat home rather than board another plane.
   She eventually decided that flying home beside her father, Jarle
Skaanes, was the only way to overcome her fear.
   After talking with reporters at Fornebu Airport, Miss Skaanes
boarded another plane for the short flight from Oslo to her
hometown of Trondheim, NTB said.

<HEAD>Woman Shoots Man She Accused of Rape, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman angered over the dismissal of a rape
charge shot and critically wounded the man she had accused, police
said today.
   Elizabeth Gooden, 26, was being held without bail for
investigation of attempted murder. Her brother, Leroy Gooden, 31,
was booked on the same charge for allegedly fleeing the scene of
the shooting with the gun, police said.
   Wilson Picquet, 38, who lived in the same apartment complex as
the Goodens, was in critical condition today at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said police Detective John Bunch.
   Ms. Gooden told police Friday that she had been raped by Picquet
after a night of drinking in his apartment, Bunch said. Picquet was
booked for investigation of rape the same day.
   Miss Gooden, Picquet, detectives and a deputy district attorney
met Tuesday to examine the case. Picquet said Miss Gooden had
agreed to have sex with him, but the couple argued later.
   The deputy district attorney dismissed the case, saying it
hinged on Gooden's word against Picquet's.
   Bunch said the woman had given no indication she was upset
enough to attack Picquet. But as he returned to the apartment
complex about Tuesday night, Gooden fired one shot at close range
into Picquet's chest, then stood over him and fired seven more
shots from a .380-caliber automatic pistol, Bunch said.
   She also threw a beer bottle at him, the detective said.
   She then allegedly handed the gun to her brother, who was
arrested a few blocks away, without the weapon, said Bunch.

<HEAD>Romanian Leader Says Living Standard Rose in Last Decade</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Ceausescu throughout.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's president, indirectly denying
widespread reports of economic hardship, said in an interview
published Wednesday that living standards in his country rose
greatly in the last decade.
   President Nicolae Ceausescu told the rightist daily newspaper
ABC that living standards and state investment increased at the
same time that Romania managed to pay off its foreign debt. Romania
first announced in April that the debt _ at $11 billion in 1981 _
had been eliminated.
   ``In this manner the repayment of the foreign debt not only did
not affect our projects but economic development and the standard
of living increased,'' said Ceausescu.
   Romania used to be known as the breadbasket of central Europe
before World War II, but agricultural production decreased by the
1950s after the communist leadership decided to invest
predominantly in heavy industry.
   Shortages increased with Ceausescu's decision in the 1970s to
funnel most of Romania's foreign currency earnings into debt
payments. As a result, agricultural and manufactured goods needed
at home frequently were exported. Investment went into now-outmoded
industries, and Western experts generally agree that industrial and
agricultural production figures are below pre-World War II levels.
   Western journalists who traveled to Bucharest this month for a
meeting of the Warsaw Pact nations reported that most staple
commodities were rationed.
   Answering nine questions accepted from a list presented by the
newspaper, Ceausescu said Romania's industrial output had increased
135 times since 1945 and agricultural production has increased
tenfold.
   The subject of Ceausescu's succession was not included in the
list of acceptable questions. Ceausescu, 71, came to power in 1965.
   He said sanctions imposed by the European Parliament _ the
12-nation Common Market's legislature _ for alleged human rights
violations didn't represent general opinion in Western Europe, and
``business goes on.''
   The newspaper said the Romanian leader asked those comments be
off the record, but it published them anyway.
   Ceausescu said there is no restriction on emigration but the
government discourages Romanians from leaving. His comment
contrasted with claims of harassment by those who have applied to
leave and documented cases of border shootings of others trying to
flee.
   ``We believe people should not leave the country of their birth,
that they should remain and work to create a better future,'' he
said.
   Each year, 11,000 ethnic Germans born in Romania are allowed to
emigrate to West Germany in exchanged for hard-currency payments by
Bonn.

   On the cover is a half-naked woman, blood
trickling from her mouth.
   Inside are 110 pages of small type and pen-and-ink sketches of
men with cigarettes clenched in their teeth and women with tears
streaming down their faces and dresses sliding off their shoulders.
   It must be the writing that makes ``The Demon Couple'' sell:
   ``A tall shadow comes through the door. She wants to cry out,
she wants to struggle, but everything is so sudden. The shadow sits
on the edge of the bed ... and undoes her buttons.''
   It is the kind of sexually explicit, sensationalist story that
officials and editorial writers have condemned as ``spiritual
drugs'' as they conduct a national magazine and book banning and
burning campaign to root out alleged Western liberal influences.
   But ``The Demon Couple'' and similar short-stories, all
unthinkable in the more puritan atmosphere of a decade ago, remain
on the market, their lurid covers framing many private bookstalls.
Hard-core pornography is available too, only slightly less boldly
displayed.
   The China Daily said Tuesday that authorities had seized 236,000
pornographic books and magazines nationwide this year, but
booksellers say most of what seized is political: books with somber
titles such as ``America As a Riddle'' by journalist Liu Binyan and
``A 10-Year History of the Cultural Revolution.''
   Booksellers keep these hidden under their tables.
   When Yan, former head of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences'
Political Science Institute, published his book several years ago,
it gained popularity among students for its insights into past
factional fighting. But Yan spoke out in support of student
pro-democracy protesters this spring, and fled the country to
escape arrest. Now, he is referred to in the official media as
``the wanted Yan Jiaqi.''
   Liu was in the United States during the protests, but he
condemned the crackdown, putting himself in the ranks of the
ostracized.
   He has become so taboo that an editor at a publishing company
who put out a book about him was arrested, and copies of the book
were ordered burned.
   The State Press and Publications Administration said last week
it had made a list of 60 banned books, but did not identify them.
These can only be deduced from what the Culture Ministry has seized
from private stalls and what has disappeared from the shelves of
state-run stores.
   They include biographies of ousted Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and several histories of modern China.
   It is almost impossible to buy the narrative from the popular
television program ``River Elegy,'' which stirred up controversy
when it was shown last year for disparaging such Chinese cultural
totems as the Great Wall.
   Aging revolutionary veterans reportedly were incensed, but Hu
Qili, the top party official in charge of the arts, said at the
time: ``Leading cadres may comment on literary and art works but
their remarks should not be regarded as mandatory. At no time
should such questions be handled by launching a political
movement.''
   The veterans have won the day, however. Hu was purged in June
along with party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and one of the
authors of ``River Elegy,'' Su Xiaokang, is reported arrested. The
People's Daily recently devoted one-third of its front page to a
bitter attack on the show. Stations are barred from airing its
sequel, and Su's other writings are banned.
   The China Daily said Monday that authorities in southwest
China's Sichuan province shut down the provincial Academy of Social
Sciences' publishing company, accusing it of printing an book that
``curses the Communist Party, party leaders and workers'
movements.'' The book was not named.
   Tales of illicit love and crime, meanwhile, sell briskly to
Chinese seeking escape from their drab workaday lives.
   The plots vie in sensationalism. Women are seduced by evil
gamblers, drugged and raped by city slickers, forced into
prostitution by factory bosses. Many commit suicide. Young men
slide into lives of crime and end up as murderers.
   The Communist Party is promoting alternate summer reading:
senior leader Deng Xiaoping's statements on quelling the student
protests, and compilations of newspaper editorials arguing that
socialism is China's only hope. At least three special books on the
protests have been issued or announced so far.
   But store clerks say the chief purchasers are work units,
ordering by the dozen for political study classes.
   The masses of readers seem to prefer stories of the kind the
party has dubbed ``spiritual opium.''
   ``The stories are bizarre and they draw you in,'' said a young
woman reader. ``They are not real-life, but if you come home from
work and are tired, you sit down and read one and you can't put it
down.''
   What about Deng's speech? ``Meiyisi'' _ ``It's boring.''

<HEAD>U.S. Connection Enriches Salvadoran Town</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INTIPUCA, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every morning at 6 o'clock, when
many homes in eastern El Salvador listen to guerrilla-run radio,
this town's 2,000 families tune in a social service program to hear
if their U.S. dollars have arrived.
   ``Paulina Cabrera, you have correspondence from the United
States. Please come pick it up,'' says an announcer 20 miles away
in San Miguel while reading the list of residents favored by the
latest international courier delivery.
   Every single family here has at least one relative living in the
Washington area. One resident says almost as many Intipuquenos have
gone to Washington as remained behind.
   The chain-reaction from one resident's journey 22 years ago has
made Intipuca an island of prosperity in a sea of backwardness.
   It also underscores the dependence of tens of thousands of
Salvadoran families _ and the national economy as a whole _ on
money sent by relatives working in the United States.
   The amount sent back to this tiny, war-ravaged Central American
country from about 500,000 Salvadorans who emigrated northward is
believed to roughly equal annual U.S. economic aid to El Salvador,
which stands at $433 million.
   The signs of Intipuca's properity are everywhere. Television
antennae sprout from almost all its red tile roofs, which sit atop
decorous, brightly painted homes. Even late-model Japanese pickups
and four-wheel drive vehicles _ some with Virginia or District of
Columbia plates _ are parked on the streets.
   The land around Intipuca, in the easternmost province of La
Union, is no more fertile than elsewhere in El Salvador.
   It provides enough corn and beans to keep hunger at bay.
However, there is no way to escape the poverty, unemployment,
disease and ignorance that characterize the lives of most rural
Salvadorans.
   This town is better off than its neighbors for one main reason:
Sigifrido Chavez ventured to Washington in 1967.
   Things went well there for the industrious young man, who
started out washing dishes, moved on to construction and eventually
started a small business.
   He returned to Intipuca a year after leaving, but only to visit,
show off his new wardrobe and take back his brother to Washington.
Before long, young men and women were taking advantage of the era's
freely granted visas and emigrating there by the score in hopes of
getting ahead.
   Most of them did.
   ``It's because of the unity, the solidarity among Intipuquenos
that they have done well. One helps another, he helps the next, and
so on,'' said Maximiliano Arias.
   Arias, who heads the town council that decides how to spend
communal funds sent by a Washington committee of Intipuquenos, said
Intipuca's latest census shows a population of just over 11,000.
   ``That's about how many Intipuquenos we calculate are in
Washington,'' said Arias, who has two sons there.
   He said the U.S. connection provides an estimated $100,000 a
month family-to-family and several thousand dollars more a year in
funds for community projects.
   The Intipuca community in Washington holds dances and barbecues
at which donations are made for the hometown.
   Such contributions paved the town's streets and renovated the
church and school. Current projects include construction of a
basketball court and establishment of a rehabilitation center for
handicapped children.
   In September 1983, the town was overrun and held for a day by
leftist guerrillas. Nearly 10 years of revolution have provided
other reasons to emigrate.
   Domitila Blanco's daughter, Flor, and her son, Julian, left in
the six months after the guerrilla raid. The period marked a surge
in emigration.
   Mrs. Blanco runs a dry goods store and letter-forwarding service
in Intipuca. She praises the U.S. connection.
   ``Before, people were so poor here they would go to the sea to
fish for crabs. Now they walk around in coats and ties,'' she said.
   Her daughter married a U.S.-born son of an Intipuqueno couple
and lives in condominium in Arlington, Va.
   However, she still misses her departed children and says her two
children still at home will not go north. ``As long as I have life
in me, I'll not let them go to the United States,'' she said.
   In an case, visas are nearly impossible to obtain these days.
Town council member Julio Benitez says the flow of emigrants from
Intipuca slowed dramatically since the 1986 reform of U.S.
immigration laws.

   The shooting death of the suspect in the slaying
of the daughter of late soul singer Jackie Wilson means the case
will go unresolved.
   Gary Johnson, 28, was shot several times early Sunday as he
entered a Detroit home, police said.
   Johnson was charged with second-degree murder in the death of
Jacqueline Wilson 37, last year. Police believe she was hit by
gunfire Johnson intended for another man.
   Johnson, who faced an Oct. 2 trial, had been free on $50,000
bond.
   Detroit detectives declined to discuss a possible motive, but
said the shooting was unrelated to Wilson's death.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
on Wednesday watched a thunderous display by Britain's most
advanced jet fighters during a visit that he said reflected the
easing of East-West tensions.
   ``We are learning more about each other,'' said Yazov, the first
Soviet defense minister to visit a NATO country since the end of
World War II.
   ``If we are more open, we are hoping that peace will be provided
and strengthened,'' the general said after watching the display at
Leuchars, a Royal Air Force base.
   He grinned as a Harrier fighter-bomber showed off its special
capabilities by flying backward.
   Yazov, on the second day of a four-day official visit, later
visited the British aircraft carrier HMS Invincible off the
Scottish coast.
   At an impromptu news conference in Leuchars, Yazov said that
during a meeting Tuesday with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the
discussion focused on the dangers of modern weapons.
   Britain's outgoing defense secretary, George Younger,
accompanied Yazov. Younger resigned this week to resume a business
career but is staying on until Friday to serve as a host to the
Soviets.
   Yazov flew aboard a Royal Air Force plane from London and was
greeted at Leuchars by a kilt-wearing bagpiper.
   With the sun trying to break through dark clouds, Yazov
inspected the newest model of the Tornado jet fighter, the F-3. It
is an all-weather aircraft to be used to intercept unidentified
aircraft entering British airspace.
   About 40 of the long-range planes, built by a British, German
and Italian consortium, will be stationed at Leuchars this year to
replace older Phantom F-4s.
   Yazov also saw the attack version of the Tornado loaded with
bombs and missiles. Four of these planes burst over the horizon to
simulate an attack on a runway.
   During a deafening display by a Tornado F-3 and a Harrier, Yazov
and his aides passed up the earmuffs provided for them, even when
the Harrier hovered directly in front of them.
   ``It was strange to have the Soviet defense minister standing
next to me,'' Group Capt. A.J.C. Bagnall, the base's commanding
officer, said later. ``It was only sad that we only had two hours
to show him how we do business.''

   Police said they confiscated 77 rocks of

   Gregory, who has been waging a personal war on drugs in
Shreveport, said at a July 4 celebration that A.B. Palmer Park had
been cleared of drug traffic.
   Police said they chased two suspects from the park Friday and
found 26 rocks of crack on a picnic table. There were no arrests.
On Sunday, police said, they arrested a suspect on drug charges and
found 51 rocks of crack in a water bottle on a bicycle.
   They said they also seized more than $2,000 in cash and a pager.
   ``It happened in a corner of the park where most of our
attention has not been focused,'' Reginald Toran, a spokesman for
Gregory said.
   Toran said the finding of drugs didn't reflect negatively on
Gregory's effort to rid the area of drugs. ``If you had known the
park beforehand, you would understand why I say that,'' he said.

   A week of heavy rains and flooding has left 197
people dead in Zhejiang and Hebie provinces, and 21 people are
missing, official reports said Wednesday.
   More than 1,700 people have died in flooding this summer across
China.
   In the coastal province of Zhejiang, which was hit by Typhoon
Hope last week, 122 people died, 901 people were injured and 21
people were missing, the Xinhua News Agency said. It said the
province had suffered losses of $286 million.
   The storms that hit central and southern Hebei last week killed
75 people, injured 1,184, and destroyed 240,000 homes, the People's
Daily said. The rain flooded 7 million acres of farmland, washed
away 220,000 tons of grain, and cut off power, telecommunications
and transport, the newspaper reported.
   In central Hebei's Baoding prefecture, about 95 miles south of
Beijing, 220,000 people were stranded after about 22{ inches of
rain fell. In the city of Cangzhou, nine inches of rain fell in
three hours.
   While parts of China are suffering from too much rain, a severe
drought has hit western China's Xinjiang province and parts of
central Liaoning province, in the northeast. Xinhua said rain in
Xinjiang is down by 25 percent to 46 percent.
   Locusts destroyed 5 million acres of crops and rats damaged 3.2
million acres, the news agency said.

<HEAD>EDs: Inserts graf 4, President Bush, with president prepared to make

<TEXT>
   William Lucas gained ground today in his
campaign for confirmation as the nation's chief civil rights
enforcer, winning support from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who had
been viewed as a key undecided vote.
   ``I do not support William Lucas because he is black but I do
believe his background will give him special insights into the
civil rights laws,'' Specter told the Senate one day after a
meeting with the candidate.
   Specter, until now seen by Lucas critics as perhaps the only
Judiciary Committee Republican who might oppose confirmation, said
he was convinced the nominee is ``conversant with the civil rights
laws'' and would be able to draw expertise from ``a battery of
attorneys available to him.''
   President Bush is prepared to make personal telephone calls to
drum up votes for Lucas, White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said
today. ``The president ... has not made any phone calls, but he
may,'' if his involvement is seen as important, Cooper said.
   The Judiciary Committee could vote as early as Thursday on
whether to recommend Lucas' confirmation to the full Senate. The
panel is believed to be sharply split with a few undecided
lawmakers holding the balance.
   The issue has become a political tug-of-war between the Bush
administration and a number of civil rights groups which oppose
Lucas, even though he is black, on grounds he lacks experience.
   Specter told the Senate it ``has become a great American sport
to use nominees as target practice in Washington, D.C..''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., declared that ``the
media and the liberal establishment have stabbed Bill Lucas in the
back'' and that ``frankly, it's a disgrace.''
   ``Bill Lucas is a profile in courage _ what we are seeing with
the Bill Lucas nomination is a profile in liberal politics,'' Dole
said.
   Lucas, in written responses Tuesday to questions from Judiciary
Committee members, stressed his commitment to civil rights but said
there has not been enough time to assess recent Supreme Court
rulings on the issue.
   ``I agree with the president and the attorney general that it is
still too early to assess the practical impact of these rulings,''
Lucas said.
   Lucas' answers on Tuesday followed his refusal at a committee
hearing last week to criticize recent Supreme Court decisions that
have come under fire from civil rights groups.
   However, Lucas said, ``I will not tolerate the misuse of any law
or court decision to deny rights guaranteed by this nation's civil
rights laws.''
   Lucas' promise to fight misuse of court decisions came in answer
to Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who is believed to be leaning in
favor of confirmation. The senator cited two recent civil rights
decisions by the Supreme Court, City of Richmond vs. J.A. Croson
and Patterson vs. McLean.
   The first case overturned automatic municipal contract
set-asides for minority-owned firms without some finding of
previous discrimination, and the second forbade the use of an 1866
civil rights law to sue over alleged racial harassment on the job.
   ``I believe these cases have erred in upsetting the proper
balance between private actions and government enforcement
actions,'' DeConcini said in asking what Lucas would do to enforce
civil rights law.
   ``The attorney general and I recognize that some people may in
fact use the recent Supreme Court decisions in an attempt to
discriminate or to challenge legitimate affirmative action and
set-aside programs,'' Lucas said.
   ``It is my commitment to investigate and prosecute those
individuals or entities and to prevent such efforts to roll back
the hard-earned gains of the civil rights movement,'' he said.
   Lucas said he would ``lead the charge in obtaining appropriate
relief'' for anyone who suffers discrimination as a result of the
rulings.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked whether Lucas believed
affirmative action laws have aided blacks and whether he thought
such policies could result in tokenism or reverse discrimination.
   ``I feel a special obligation to enforce laws which have
benefited me,'' Lucas said.
   ``Where you have a persistent pattern of discrimination, I think
that it is entirely appropriate to order that minorities be hired
and promoted,'' he said. He added that he also approved of
voluntary affirmative action efforts by employers ``to overcome a
manifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category.''
   ``On the other hand, I think there is a danger that some
programs, under the label of affirmative action, can in certain
cases be implemented in a way that amounts to improper quota
hiring,'' he said.

   China's trade balance is good and it is able to
pay its debts, a trade official said Wednesday, but he acknowledged
that crushing the pro-democracy movement may decrease foreign
investment.
   Liu Xiangdong told reporters said China had a trade surplus
equivalent to $2.29 billion in the first half of 1989. Customs
figures issued earlier this month, which cover a broader range of
transactions, showed a large deficit.
   ``Our statistics indicate that the balance of foreign trade is
good. The payment ability of China's foreign trade is no problem,''
said Liu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade.
   He granted that stagnant exports and rising imports could
produce a deficit in the second half, and said joint ventures for
which contracts had not yet been signed could suffer. Many foreign
businessmen fled China after the army put down the student
demonstrations in June.
   ``I think some foreign businessmen are worried about the
situation, so we will have to wait and see for some time,'' Liu
said.
   His comments conflicted with earlier government reports of a
deficit trade balance and speculation about an impending shortage
of foreign exchange that would cast doubt on China's ability to pay.
   The State Statistical Bureau issued customs figures earlier that
showed a $5.79 billion trade deficit for the first six months, up
from $1.22 billion in the first half of 1988.
   A report on the customs statistics by the official Xinhua news
agency quoted Chinese analysts as saying the deficit could reach
$10 billion by year's end.
   Liu's statistics showed exports at $19.76 billion in the first
six month, virtually unchanged from the same period last year, and
imports of $17.47 billion, an increase 11.8 percent.
   Unlike those from the ministry, customs figures include imports
of raw materials for processing and such some non-trade financial
transfers.
   China has borrowed $33.1 billion from abroad in the past 10
years and another $12.1 billion has entered the country in direct
foreign investment. The government has sought in the past year to
curb excessive borrowing.
   One reason for confidence in China's ability to repay is that
more than 70 percent of the outstanding debt bears medium or low
interest rates, Liu said. He said the average annual debt-service
rate _ the ratio of repayment to total export earnings _ remains
below 10 percent, compared with rates in other countries of 20
percent to 25 percent. The debt burden will rise substantially in
the next few years, however, as loan principal comes due for
repayment.
   China has said it will apply for $500 million in new loans from
the World Bank by early next year, but the climate does not seem
receptive. After the crackdown, the bank postponed consideration of
$780.2 million in loans for which the Chinese already had applied.
   The bank, the main source of aid to developing countries, is
under pressure from the United States and other Western nations to
stop new loans because of China's harsh action against dissent.
   Most lenders to China have frozen aid or postponed consideration
of new loans, and Liu said his government was prepared to do
without further assistance if necessary.
   ``We would like to develop economic relations with all countries
... and utilize loans from those countries, but we will not accept
their using those loans as a condition to interfere in China's
internal affairs,'' he said.
   He said China is committed to an open policy on trade and the
number of Chinese companies authorized to conduct foreign trade
will be reduced from the current 5,000 to make the system more
efficient.
   ``Businessmen in both foreign and Chinese enterprises have
complained a lot about confusion in management of foreign trade,''
Liu said. ``In the future, we will be very strict in approving
those companies.''

<HEAD>Radical Student and Priest Prepare To Cross Border Under Threat of
Arrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A radical South Korean student on an
illegal trip to North Korea arrived in a border town Wednesday and
prepared to return home across the heavily militarized frontier
despite warnings she will be arrested.
   Pyongyang radio broadcasts, monitored in Tokyo, said Im Su-kyong
arrived in Kaesung, North Korea, and plans to return home Thursday
through Panmunjom, a border village in the demilitarized zone
separating the two Koreas.
   North Korea's official news agency said Miss Im was accompanied
by pacifists from 30 countries and told a rally:
   ``This land from (northern) Mount Paedku to Mount Halla (in the
south) is one country. The international peace march should be
continued to Mount Halla, not just to Panmunjom, at any cost.''
   Authorities in Seoul said they are deploying 20,000 police in
the South Korean capital and along the road leading to Panmunjom to
block radical students who have threated major anti-government
protests and a march to the border to greet Miss Im.
   The radicals hailed her as ``a national unification heroine.''
Her crossing is timed to coincide with the 36th anniversary of the
cease-fire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War and is symbolical for
radical students and dissidents who are demanding unification of
the divided peninsula.
   Government officials said Miss Im, 20, will be arrested when she
crosses the border. She faces up to seven years in prison under
security laws that ban visits to a hostile nation without
government permission.
   Seoul says any dialogue on unification must go through official
channels and accuses North Korea of fomenting unrest by encouraging
unofficial gestures.
   Miss Im, a French major at Seoul's Hankook University of Foreign
Studies, traveled to North Korea via Japan and East Germany to
attend the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students on July 1-8.
   Her defiance won support Wednesday from a South Korean priest
based in the Philippines, who flew to North Korea to accompany her
across the border, according to the Association of Priests for
Justice, a dissident Roman Catholic group in Seoul.
   It identified the priest as the Rev. Moon Gyu-hyon and said he
studied at New York's Maryknoll seminary and holds a South Korean
passport and permanent U.S. residence permit.
   ``The church has the duty to protect its lamb'' on a trip
``representing the patriotic sentiments of young students for
unification,'' the group said in a statement.
   South Korean authorities said the priest will be arrested with
Miss Im.
   Government prosecutors said they will investigate the group for
dispatching Moon.

<HEAD>Governing Party Intends to Find Uno Successor Quickly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Governing party leaders set a mid-August deadline
for swearing in a successor to resigning Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno, news reports said Wednesday.
   The deadline indicates they want to move quickly after recent
party setbacks.
   An opposition Socialist official said, however, that his party
will fight any attempts to convene Parliament too soon to name a
new prime minister.
   The news reports, based on comments by Liberal Democratic party
elders and government officials, said the party hopes to elect its
next president Aug. 8 and have the Parliament swear him in as prime
minister before mid-August holidays.
   Uno, who has been in office less than two months, said Monday he
will resign to take responsibility for his party's heavy losses in
Sunday's elections for half the seats in Parliament's upper house.
Uno's party lost 33 seats, mostly to the Socialists, the leading
opposition party.
   Uno himself has been plagued by charges he paid geishas for sex.
   It took more than a month after former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita announced his resignation April 25 for the party to
settle on Uno as a replacement. Takeshita announced that Uno would
be his successor on May 27, and Uno took office June 2.
   At the time, party leaders struggled to find someone untainted
by the scandal that brought down Takeshita. He resigned to take
responsibility in the face of reports the Recruit Co. publishing
conglomerate tried to buy influence with large political donations
and cut-rate stocks. Kyodo News Service, quoting an unidentified
top government official, said Wednesday that Uno's successor will
be sworn in Aug. 15.
   However, several other reports said the Liberal Democrats have
decided to convene a special five-day session of Parliament on Aug.
7. The mass-circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said an election
among party lawmakers will be held while Parliament is in session
and a new prime minister will be sworn in before the session ends.
   A Liberal Democratic official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the party's lower house Steering Committee met for
about an hour Wednesday to set a date for the session. But the
official added that the matter was still being negotiated with
opposition leaders.
   A Socialist Party official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said his party will fight proposals to hold the session
soon. He said it needs more time to work on a bill to abolish an
unpopular new 3 percent sales tax. He did not say exactly how long.
   The tax, forced through Parliament last year by the Liberal
Democrats, was a key issue in Sunday's elections that deprived the
governing party of a majority in the upper house for the first time
in the party's 34-year history. By law, Parliament must convene
within 30 days after an election and appoint the prime minister. It
is expected to approve the Liberal Democrats' choice because of the
governing party's large majority in the more powerful lower house.
   The party's Election Management Committee was to meet Thursday
to decide the method and timing of elections to name the next party
president.
   A party reform committee recommended Wednesday that Uno's
successor be picked by a ballot of party lawmakers instead of by
back-room negotiations, the party official said.
   Uno was virtually hand-picked by Takeshita, and many people
criticized the secretive process.
   A top contender to replace Uno, governing party Secretary
General Ryutaro Hashimoto, said Wednesday that as the party's No. 2
executive, he shares the blame for the election defeat.
   ``We have experienced defeat for the first time, and it was
while I was in charge, so I am responsible,'' Hashimoto said. He
made no reference to resigning, however.
   Hashimoto, 51, is the youngest secretary general in the party's
history.

   High on a living-room window sill in a
second-floor apartment sits a house plant with a mistaken identity.
   A week ago, Anthony Scilipoti, 26, awoke to loud banging at his
door about 6:20 a.m. He opened the door and found three state
police officers who asked if they could come in.
   ``They sort of cleared their throats and said they were there
because `You have a marijuana plant growing in your window,'''
Scilipoti recalled.
   Scilipoti was actually relieved at first, because his wife was
traveling and he thought when he first saw the officers that she
had been in an accident.
   ``At that point I started to laugh,'' Scilipoti said. ``It was
like a comic opera. It was really silly.''
   ``I just laughed, and said, `Go in and look,''' he said. ``All
three of them stood around the plant and stared at it.''
   As far as Scilipoti can remember, he bought his ``dwarf
Hawaiian'' plant in a garden or grocery store about a year ago. It
is about 18 inches tall, he said, and does not have serrated leaves
like a marijuana plant.
   Trooper Christopher Reinfurt had spotted the plant as he was
driving by one day and believed it was marijuana, said Sgt. William
H. Merritt.
   ``Chris is very experienced in this and has had a lot of prior
experience in marijuana eradication,'' Merritt said. ``From the
view that they had of the plant, I don't think anyone would be able
to differentiate it.''
   After a three-day investigation, police obtained a search
warrant July 18.
   ``Any reasonable person would understand, hopefully, that we
acted in good faith,'' Merritt said. ``In this case, it was purely
a case of mistaken identity.''

   Diego Henao has inspected hundreds of
cars, but nothing prepared him for what he found under the hood of
a new Toyota Corolla.
   Coiled around the battery was a 5-foot-long boa constrictor.
   ``Diego drove the car over from the lot, popped the hood to
check the fluid levels and there was this snake,'' said Mark Vlash,
assistant parts manager at Toyota of Stamford. ``He almost had a
heart attack.''
   It turned out the boa, whose name is Samantha, had escaped from
a cage at Jack McGraw's home a month earlier. Alerted by a radio
report about the discovery of the snake, McGraw came to take his
pet home Tuesday, to the relief of many at Toyota of Stamford.
   But parts manager Joe Munro took a shine to the snake during its
brief stay. He fixed up a box for it, with with leaves and and old
radiator hose to imitate a fellow reptile, and even sent workers
out for mice to feed Samantha.
   ``It really is a cute little thing,'' Muro said. ``He must have
been handled a lot because he is so at home being held.''

   When fashion photographer Arthur Elgort
came to town with two models and a crew of 10, the New Yorkers
found their clothes made them stick out of the rodeo crowd like
cacti in Manhattan.
   The visitors, who planned to use the 93rd annual Cheyenne
Frontier Days celebration as a backdrop for a fashion shoot,
quickly ditched their L.L. Bean shoes and Brooks Brothers shirts
for jeans and other cowboy duds.
   ``Everyone in our group must have spent $300 in Western
Outfitters today _ and that's the joke of it all _ it will even go
over well in New York,'' Elgort said recently.
   But no matter what they wore, models Cindy Crawford and Charlene
Short weren't able to disappear into the crowd.
   ``I had huge hair and a sexy top on,'' explained the 23-year-old
Crawford. ``The cowboys were screaming and shouting.''
   The photographer hopes the Wild West theme will be as big a hit
in European fashion magazines as his models were with the cowboys.
   ``To them,'' he said of the Europeans, ``Wyoming is more of
America than going to New York.''

   Former Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton
and movie star Chuck Norris are out to make names for themselves in
a new field _ power boating.
   The pair will roar across Lakes Michigan and Huron on Thursday
in a 46-foot power boat in an attempt to break a speed record set
in 1983 by another celebrity boater, Michael Reagan, son of Ronald
Reagan.
   On a 605-mile course that begins and ends in Chicago, the beefy
stars and two crew members will try to best Reagan's time of 12
hours, 34 minutes and 41 seconds.
   Norris set a record for diesel-powered boats in a 440-mile race
from San Francisco to Los Angeles last August. Payton has been
racing automobiles since retiring from the NFL after the 1987
season.
   The record try is a benefit for the United Way.

he's happy young people are joining the '60s nostalgia crowd at the

   ``You have to have a lot more instat music today,'' Lodge said.
``Perhaps people don't want to find out for themselves what a song

   Authorities have arrested two Thai
fishermen who confessed to robbing a group of Vietnamese boat
people and raping the women aboard, a police officer said Wednesday.
   The Vietnamese boat, apparantly heading from Vietnam to
Indonesia, was attacked June 7 in the Gulf of Thailand, said Lt.
Col. Prakob Benjapong of the Thai Maritime Police. He said 32 of 35
people aboard are still missing.
   Fishermen Sompong Nakmas, 33, and Thanom Pathumsuwan, 19, were
arrested Tuesday after confessing to the attack, Prakob said.
   Attacks on boat people, who sometimes flee with gold or other
valuables, have become increasingly violent in the past year and
have left scores _ if not hundreds _ dead.
   Western officials believe most attacks are carried out by
``pirates of opportunity'' _ fishermen who chance upon the
Vietnamese boats.
   The two latest fishermen under arrest were identified by three
Vietnamese women who are the only known survivors of the attack,
Prakob said. The women came ashore in the southern Thai province of
Pattani on June 25, he said.
   They told authorities the two fishermen had threatened the men
in the Vietnamese boat with knives and iron bars before taking 11
women aboard their own boat. The women said the men raped them
while keeping them prisoner, Prakob reported.
   The fishermen later freed three women, but the whereabouts of
the eight others and the 24 Vietnamese men are unknown, he said.
   Prakob said the fishermen told him they allowed the men to go
free with their boat and later let the eight other women swim
ashore.
   The police officer said authorities are seeking up to nine other
fishermen in the attack.
   It was the fifth time since June 22 that police have arrested
Thai fishermen for pirate attacks involving murder, rape or robbery
of Vietnamese boat people, he said.
   Last month, police said four other Thai fishermen were arrested
and confessed to killing 130 Vietnamese refugees April 16 off the
Malaysian coast.
   Prakob said Friday that police arrested three Thai fishermen who
confessed to killing 56 Vietnamese boat people in an attack March
26.
   More than 1.5 million Vietnamese have left their homeland since
the communist takeover in April 1975.

   The foreign ministers of Belgium and Zaire
signed an agreement Wednesday to normalize relations and forget a
bitter 18-month dispute over the Central African nation's debt to
its former colonizer.
   As part of the agreement, Belgium canceled about $285 million in
debts owed by Zaire, delegation sources said.
   It also agreed to a 14-year period during which interest
payments on $370 million in outstanding Zairean commercial debts
will be made to a fund for development projects in Zaire.
   The agreement was reached late Tuesday between Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens of Belgium and President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire, who attended the signing ceremony at the royal palace.
   They applauded as Zairean Foreign Minister Nguza Karl-I-Bond and
his Belgian counterpart, Mark Eyskens, signed the accord.
   The signing ceremony originally was scheduled for Tuesday but
was postponed following last-minute difficulties over details of
the accord.
   Officials said the main obstacle was Belgian insistence on
mentioning the International Monetary Fund as the umbrella
organization for carrying out the agreement.
   The Zaire delegation refused to accept reference to the fund on
grounds the agreement ``was strictly a bilateral matter between
Zaire and Belgium,'' delegation sources reported.
   The two delegations met Tuesday night at a dinner put on by
Morocco's King Hassan II, who helped resolve the dispute.
   A communique issued after the signing ceremony said the two
governments had ``put an end to the crisis in their relations ...
and removed all obstacles to their continued good relations on the
basis of legality.''
   The communique said both governments expressed their gratitude
to the king for his ``invaluable aid.''
   Belgium and Zaire, which used to be the Belgian Congo, have been
at odds since December 1987, when Mobutu rejected Brussels' offers
to ease the debt burden and denounced the treaty of friendship
between the two countries.

<HEAD>County Offers to Fill in For Kennebunkport Police During Bush Visits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   York County officials say they will provide
security assistance for presidential visits to Kennebunkport,
following the town's decision that police protection cost too much.
   ``This commission was most concerned and distressed by the
decision of Kennebunkport municipal officials to discontinue
providing security assistance'' for visits by George Bush to his
coastal vacation home, the three county commissioners wrote.
   The commissioners told Secret Service Director John Simpson that
``we have directed the York County Sheriff's Department to provide
continuing security services as may be necessary and requested.''
   Last week, in ``the most difficult letter I have ever written,''
Kennebunkport Town Manager Jane Duncan informed the White House
that town police would no longer be available for traffic control
and similar duties assisting the Secret Service and state police.
   ``This difficult decision was made solely on the basis of our
budgetary limitations,'' she said. Officials had said the special
security details were costing about $1,500 a day.
   The county commissioners voted unanimously Monday to pick up the
local duties. Their letter to Simpson was mailed Tuesday, said
County Administrator David Adjutant.
   ``While we too as elected and responsible officials have
financial concerns, we are committed that the security of the most
powerful man in the world be given priority over monetary issues,''
the commissioners wrote.
   The commissioners also told Simpson the county would be ``most
appreciative of any reimbursement.''
   Adjutant said the county had already spent $4,800 as part of its
participation in cooperative policing efforts for presidential
visits. He declined to project how much more the county might have
to spend.
   The president was last in Kennebunkport for an extended Fourth
of July weekend. He plans a three-week visit next month.

region Solidarity leader.
   ``That's why the answer to the question how can we help
Czechoslovakia enter the road of reforms is very important to us,''
Bujak said in an interview published Tuesday in the opposition's
Gazeta Wyborcza daily newspaper.
   Communist leaders in Poland and Hungary have moved toward
increased political plurality. In contrast, Czechoslovakia's
leadership has refused to hold talks with opposition groups and
consistently has condemned activists.
   Bujak was one of five Solidarity members in Czechoslovakia for
meetings with dissidents and with Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the
leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia, Cardinal
Frantisek Tomasek.
   Leading the delegation was Parliament deputy Adam Michnik, a
longtime Solidarity activist who this month met with advocates of
reform in the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies.
   Bujak said Polish activists would like to participate in the
Czechoslovak opposition's observance next month of the 21st
anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. He said Czechoslovak
dissidents also may be invited to visit Poland later in the year.
   The 1968 invasion ended the reformist policies of Alexander
Dubcek, which resembled some of the changes now being implemented
in the Soviet Union. Three members of the Solidarity delegation met
Monday with Dubcek in Bratislava.
   The visit was criticized in Warsaw by the Communist Party daily
Trybuna Ludu as potentially harmful to ``good and friendly''
Polish-Czechoslovak relations.

<TEXT>
   A man being held in New Mexico was
charged with murder today in the July 19 slayings of two
convenience store clerks.
   Gregg Francis Braun, 28, of Garden City, is already charged in
Sunday's shooting death of a New Mexico store clerk. The shootings
are similar to slayings in Ardmore, Okla., and Pampa, Texas, in
which another suspect has been charged.
   Braun, the son of a Garden City lawyer, was charged in the
slaying of Barbara Kochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, clerks at
convenience stores in this southwest Kansas town.
   He was charged in Finney County District Court with two counts
each of murder, robbery and kidnapping, said police Capt. Stan
Wojdylak. Bond was set at $1 million.
   Wojdylak said evidence gathered from a house in Garden City and
from New Mexico was taken to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation
Laboratory in Topeka today for analysis.
   ``As a result of the evidence, an arrest warrant was issued,''
the police captain said. He would not describe the evidence.
   Michael Frank Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., is being held in
Ardmore on charges of killing clerks in Oklahoma and Texas. He had
been considered a prime suspect in the Kansas slayings before
Braun's arrest.
   Asked if Greene remained a suspect in the slayings, Wojdylak
said only that ``the scope of the investigation is not limited to
Mr. Braun.''
   Asked if there was any connection between the two men, Wojdylak
said, ``That's why we're continuing our investigation. ... We need
to see if there is a possible link.''
   Wojdylak said he would release no information about ballistics
tests conducted in New Mexico on a .25-caliber handgun found in
Braun's car when he was arrested at a roadblock Sunday near
Cimarron, N.M. The five victims in four states were all believed to
have been killed with a .25-caliber gun.
   New Mexico officials also said they wouldn't release results of
ballistics tests until a court hearing Aug. 2.
   Braun was arraigned in Raton, N.M., Monday on a murder charge in
the death of Geraldine Valdez, 48, a Springer convenience store
clerk who was shot twice in the head.
   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon reported today that employees of
the Grain Bin, a Garden City nightclub, knew both Greene and Braun,
but there was no immediate indication the two men knew each other.
   Braun had been a maintenance employee at the S-Bar Ranch Feed
Yard near Garden City. Feed Yard manager Galen Wright said Braun
came to work Thursday, the day after the Garden City slayings,
picked up his paycheck and said he wouldn't be back.
   Greene had been staying at the Wheat Lands Motor Inn this month
in Garden City but left without paying a $295 bill, motel officials
said.
   Part of the bill was for drinks at the Grain Bin, which is
affiliated with the motel. Motel officials said they moved his
belongings out of his room July 17, two days before the killings.
   Greene was arrested without incident Sunday when he sought
treatment for a back injury at a Lawton, Okla., hospital.
   Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham said a survivor
of one of the Oklahoma shootings had identified Greene from
photographs as the assailant. Prosecutors said Tuesday another
photo lineup will be conducted, this time with Braun's picture.
   Pampa police have charged Greene with capital murder in the
shooting of a photo shop owner.

<HEAD>European Nations Criticize U.S. Decision to Extend Steel Quotas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community said Wednesday
that President Bush's decision to extend U.S. steel import quotas
was unnecessary because the American industry has made an
impressive comeback.
   Bush said he took the measure, announced Tuesday, to try to
press negotiations to end other countries' unfair trade practices
and give the U.S. industry more time to modernize.
   But the European Community, West Europe's 12-nation trading
bloc, complained about the decision.
   ``After an uninterrupted period of protection ... a renewal of
these accords in the steel sector is not necessary considering the
remarkable progress registered by American steel,'' it said.
   The industry has improved both financially and competitively in
recent years, and the world outlook for steel has brightened, it
said.
   In a response to the criticism, Thomas Niles, the U.S.
ambassador to the European Community, said the U.S. action was
designed to give more time to come up with a trading system based
on freer markets.
   ``We should try to turn steel trade into a market-driven
operation rather than one that is driven largely by government
subsidies and interventions by governments in the market,'' he said.
   He predicted European officials will take a closer look at the
program and ``will see it as in their interest to join with us in
this effort to move toward a market-based system.''
   The community also complained that the quotas have limited
European steelmakers more than other foreign producers in gaining
access to the U.S. market.
   The European bloc's share of the American steel market tumbled
from 8 percent before the quotas to 5.6 percent afterward,
according to its figures.
   The trading bloc exported 5.9 million metric tons of steel
products to the United States in 1988. A metric ton is equivalent
to 2,205 pounds or 1.1 short tons.
   The quotas were first imposed by the Reagan administration in
1984. They were due to expire Sept. 30.
   They set annual limits on the amount of steel that could be
brought into the United States from 29 countries, including those
of the European Community, Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
   The quotas were imposed at a time when the U.S. industry was
suffering heavy losses. Steel manufacturers complained foreign
producers had an unfair advantage because of government subsidies
and import restrictions.
   American steelmakers acknowledge the U.S. import quotas have
helped their giant industry become profitable again. But they argue
they still need time to modernize their operations without
competition from subsidized foreign products.
   In his announcement, Bush said he had asked U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills to negotiate a 30-month extension of
voluntary restraint agreements that limit the 29 countries to 18.4
percent of the U.S. market. The European Community's share of the
total quota is 27 percent.
   Bush's quota extension will allow the overall foreign market
share to rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are
phased out entirely. Hills said that yearly increase would be
allocated to countries that exhibit the most willingness to stop
subsidizing their domestic industry.
   Bush said the restrictions will end on March 31, 1992.

<HEAD>Along With Cabinet Shuffle, Ministerial Mansions Are Swapped</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the political trauma of this week's Cabinet
shuffle by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lies a house-swapping
drama on a grand scale.
   Bumped from his post as foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe
lost both his magnificent London residence and his weekend retreat,
a 115-room country mansion.
   Fit for a king _ indeed once owned by Prince Charles _ the $8
million Chevening House, its gardens, maze and 3,500 acres now make
up the country retreat of the new foreign secretary, John Major.
   But Howe, a seasoned international negotiator, bargained with
Mrs. Thatcher to soften the blow and came away with a consolation
prize: the country house allocated to the treasury chief,
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   Howe emerged from the sweeping shake-up of the 22-member Cabinet
as deputy prime minister, a post widely seen as a demotion and
carrying no official accommodation.
   Lawson yielded the country home, Dorneywood, apparently
reluctantly after reportedly hearing of the decision when Howe
mentioned it on a morning radio program.
   He is staying with this wife and two children for a summer
holiday at the $6.5 million red-brick residence northwest of London
where the amenities include a heated pool, squash courts and
billiard rooms.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmakers were also not amused, calling
the mansion-swapping exercise an embarrassment.
   ``With millions of homeless without money sleeping in cardboard
boxes, to witness Cabinet ministers squabbling over the possession
of luxury homes is disgraceful,'' said Max Madden.
   It was not clear as the dust settled where Lawson would spend
his weekends, although he retains his No. 11 Downing Street home,
next door to Mrs. Thatcher at No. 10. He also personally owns a
$400,000 former vicarage in Leicestershire, central England.
   Howe, who flew to France on vacation, is houseless for the
summer. He has only a small apartment in a less-than-trendy area.
   Major, who grew up in a two-room apartment, also receives Howe's
London house on historic Carlton House Terrace.
   Sir Roy Strong, a trustee of Chevening and former director of
the Victoria and Albert Museum, said both Howe and his wife,
Elspeth, were sure to miss the mansion, designed by the 17th
century master architect Inigo Jones.
   He described the house as a ``country house of the greatest
comfort, luxury and elegance.''
   Flanked by two wings and fronted by a Palladian facade, the
house in southeastern England was left to Britain 20 years ago by a
great landed family, the Stanhopes. It was originally to have been
Prince Charles' but the heir to the throne gave it back to the
state in 1980.
   ``The Howes used it a great deal,'' Strong told BBC radio.
``They did a lot of entertaining at the weekend, they held family
Christmases there. I'm sure they're absolutely desolated that
they're going.''
   Strong said Howe used a tapestry room, filled with lacquer
furniture, as his study and his desk overlooked a lake.

   A murder victim's mother and brother
were found guilty of contempt for a courtroom brawl that erupted
when a convicted murderer smirked as deputies led him away.
   Jeffrey Edgar Tucker, 17, was being led from the courtroom
Tuesday when his victim's brother lunged, punching Tucker in the
face and dragging him and a bailiff to the floor.
   The ensuing fistfight halted Superior Court proceedings for the
day.
   As officials struggled to bring Brian Todd Logan, 24, under
control, Logan's mother punched Tucker twice in the chest.
   People climbed over chairs to get away, a bailiff got punched
and Superior Court Judge W. Douglas Albright later said he had
pounded his gavel so hard he dented a desk.
   Albright sentenced Tucker to 50 years in prison for the shooting
death of Donald Ray Logan, 32. Tucker had pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder.
   Logan was riding his moped to work the night of Dec. 20, 1988,
when he stopped to respond to Tucker and two other men who were
challenging him to fight. Logan's family said Tucker smirked at
them as he left court, according to High Point Detective Lindsay
Royal.
   Albright found Brian Logan and his mother, Patricia Logan,
guilty of criminal contempt of court.
   Logan was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500. When Mrs.
Logan stood for sentencing, she collapsed and the judge delayed her
sentencing to Sept. 18.

<HEAD>Magazine Alleges Rhodesians Burned Bodies of Black Nationalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading black magazine says the former
white Rhodesian government secretly burned the bodies of black
nationalist guerrillas in an incinerator that it likened to the
ovens of Nazi Germany.
   The August issue of the independent Parade magazine said the
incinerator is hidden in thickly wooded grounds at Chikurubi
maximum-security prison, near Harare, where scores of guerrillas
were executed.
   It said the now-idle incinerator was used to dispose of bodies
of an unspecified number of guerrillas executed during the
seven-year war that forced independence and brought the black
majority-ruled nation of Zimbabwe into existence in April 1980.
   Former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith, the last white ruler
of this ex-British colony, denied there were covert executions and
said his government burned only papers in incinerators.
   The magazine, which claims a readership of more than 1 million
in this southern African nation of 9 million people, said the
incinerator was Rhodesia's equivalent to the ovens the Nazis used
in World War II.
   Parade described the incinerator as the size of a small house
with a 10-yard chimney extending through the roof. According to a
stamp embossed into its heavy iron casing, the incinerator was
called ``Macro-Burn'' by its makers in Johannesburg, the magazine
said.
   ``It must be one of the most efficient crematoriums in southern
Africa,'' said Political Affairs Minister Eddison Zvobgo, who is
campaigning for it to be declared a national memorial.
   ``We think the incinerator should become a national monument
like those in Germany today,'' he said.
   The incinerator is equipped with fan-assisted oil-fired burners
and at one end features a high-walled ``sluice yard'' where
truckloads of corpses allegedly were dumped, said Zvobgo, who was
Zimbabwe's first justice minister.
   He said that in 1980, President Robert Mugabe's new government
found no accurate records of guerrilla executions and believes most
were destroyed by outgoing Rhodesian authorities.
   Between 1976 and 1979, Zvobgo said, an unknown number of
guerrillas were tried summarily by military courts and were
executed with no legal recourse to appeal the death sentence.
   The war had reached a stage when the level of killings made it
impractical to bury or keep records of the dead, Zvogbo charged.
   About 30,000 Zimbabweans, mostly black civilians, died in the
war.
   Smith told a news conference that guerrillas were tried and
executed under anti-terrorism laws.
   The retired politician, who ruled from 1965 until independence,
said he believes the report was timed to distract attention from
the government's political woes.
   It is the latest in a series of attacks against the nation's
remaining 100,000 whites, he charged.
   ``I do recall we had incinerators for burning papers and I
believe we had a big clean up of a mountain (of papers) which
required burning when the change of government took place,'' said
Smith.
   Recently, the government has been criticized for corruption and
policies that have led to record unemployment, commodity shortages
and rising inflation.

<TEXT>
   It's like a World Series of weeds, a Hula
Bowl of herbicides, with agriculture students from U.S. and
Canadian universities competing to identify problems in farm fields.
   This year, Iowa State took top honors in the Collegiate Weed
Science Contest, which tests students' ability to identify weeds
and the right chemical to kill them and diagnose herbicide failure.
   ``They need to be able to recognize weeds when they are tiny,''
said James Worthington of Western Kentucky University, president of
the North Central Weed Science Society. ``When they get big enough
that anybody can recognize them, it's too late to do anything about
them.''
   The society sponsored its ninth annual competition for 64
students Tuesday at the FMC Corp. research farm in Champaign County.
   Students twisted yellow nozzles onto a portable chemical rig,
calibrated an application rate and sprayed liquids into measuring
beakers. Judges timed their work and evaluated their decisions.
   Students scattered into a field where 96 plastic rings circled
patches of weeds, some so tiny they were almost invisible. Brian
Otteson of North Dakota State occasionally used a magnifying glass
to detect tiny clues to their identity.
   ``It is really good experience identifying all these weeds so
you know what to expect across the country,'' he said. ``Also, you
are able to recognize the chemical-injury symptoms on the plants.''
   Plots of crops and weeds were sprayed with various herbicides
and contestants were asked to identify the chemicals based on the
plants' response.
   Finally, students went into a small field and were confronted by
a contest official playing the role of an upset farmer. In one
case, a herbicide had allowed weeds to thrive. In another, a
chemical had damaged the cash crop.
   ``On the `goof plot' you have to be decisive and defend your
diagnosis,'' said Nebraska coach Dave Mortensen, who thought that
might be the toughest task for students. ``It can be very
intimidating. They need to learn to be confident and assertive.''
   A grumpy, cigar-chomping David Lamore met Kirk Reese of Ohio
State in a sunflower field.
   ``I used almost 3.5 pounds of the stuff, and it should have
controlled the crab grass,'' said Lamore.
   Reese, taking the role of a chemical company representative,
said the herbicide killed most of the weeds it was designed for,
suggesting it be applied at a higher dosage in future.
   Joel Rissman, a University of Illinois senior who plans to farm,
said the contest provided valuable experience.
   ``I am worried about the overuse and the misuse of chemicals,''
Rissman said. ``You have to learn to use the right chemical for the
job and use it at the right rate.''

<HEAD>New President Wants More Power for European Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baron Enrique Crespo, the new
president of the European Parliament, called Wednesday for more
power for the 518-seat assembly.
   ``If we aspire toward a united Europe, someone must administer
this union, and someone must monitor those who administer the
union,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that national governments of the 12 European
Economic Community member states view the demands for greater power
with ``suspicion and distrust.'' But, he said, national parliaments
of the EEC nations ``must see us as partners in the democratic
monitoring of institutions.''
   The European Parliament, the only one of the EEC's institutions
to be democratically elected, is frequently dismissed as no more
than a debating chamber.
   Specifically addressing this point, the 45-year old Spanish
lawyer said the parliament should make its ``debates more serious
and to the point, always and in all circumstances.''
   He was alluding to the body's propensity to adopt resolutions
and reports on human rights abuses or natural catastrophes on the
other side of the globe.
   Crespo said the parliament's ``prime concern must be the
immediate problems which directly affect European citizens.''
   For the time being it can amend or reject the EEC's budget,
which only becomes operational once the parliament's president has
signed it.
   It also can dismiss all 17 members of the EEC's Executive
Commission, which drafts community laws, and can prevent or delay
legislation from going into force by sending drafts back to the
commission.
   The parliament must also be consulted on certain measures aimed
at creating a single market by the end of 1992.
   It can veto or delay some EEC treaties with other countries, and
new applications for Common Market membership must gain at least
260 votes in the parliament to be accepted.
   However, the parliament cannot initiate legislation, and in
economic and monetary affairs its opinion does not have to be taken
into account _ a situation Crespon criticized.
   ``We are entitled to demand parliament's full participation'' in
the work of the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and
Monetary Union, he said, referring to a plan to create full
monetary union among the 12 member states.
   Parliament should also be involved in the ``drawing up of the
new texts which are to regulate Community economic and monetary
union in the future,'' he said.
   Also on Wednesday, British legislator John Tomlinson accused the
French government of ``bribery'' in giving each parliamentarian an
expensive, leather-bound personal organizer, a color TV set, a fax
machine and a paging system.
   France, Belgium and Luxembourg have been fighting for years over
where the parliament should be located.
   It now holds its monthly week-long plenary sessions in
Strasbourg, has its committee meetings a five-hour train ride away
in Brussels, Belgium, and has its administrative headquarters in
Luxembourg, midway between the two.
   ``In my vocabulary there is only one word for this: bribery,''
said Tomlinson, a socialist, implying the gifts were an attempt to
swing sentiment in favor of the Strasbourg location.
   He introduced a motion calling on the EEC governments to fix a
permanent Brussels base for the assembly.

<TEXT>
   Ponies weren't the only ones to get wet
at the 64th annual wild pony swim Wednesday.
   Some people in a crowd of about 30,000 waited more than five
hours in rain, mud and swarms of mosquitoes to get the best view of
the ponies being herded across the channel from Assateague Island
to Chincoteague on Virginia's Eastern Shore.
   Lonnie Poling of San Antonio, Texas, got to the marshy shore
about 5 a.m.
   ``Just in time for the thunder and lightning and rain,'' he said
as he pressed against a fence.
   The Polings and others stood through the brief downpour and
stayed put as the mosquitoes came out and temperatures headed into
the 80s.
   Finally low tide arrived, and at about 10:15 a.m. the ponies
made the 10-minute swim. Tourists applauded and snapped pictures of
the animals' heads bobbing above the water.
   The ponies seemed oblivious to the excitement as they calmly
walked ashore and munched on marsh grass before they were herded
through the streets to the town's carnival grounds to be auctioned
off.
   Members of the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department hope to
sell 30 to 50 of the ponies Thursday to thin the herd and raise
money for the animals' upkeep during the winter.
   The roundup, made famous in ``Misty of Chincoteague'' and other
children's books by Marguerite Henry, began in 1925 to finance the
volunteer fire department.
   Firefighters now use the money to support the herd of ponies on
Assateague, located just off the Atlantic Ocean side of the
peninsula that forms Chesapeake Bay.
   No one is sure how the ponies got to Assateague. The most
commonly accepted theory is that they are descendants of horses
hidden on the island by early settlers who wanted to avoid paying
taxes on the animals.
   A more romantic story holds that the ponies escaped from a
Spanish galleon that was wrecked off the coast more than 300 years
ago.
   The auction usually raises $12,000 to $18,000, said Everett
Lewis, who was president of the fire department last year.
   ``They never do pay for themselves. It costs us more to keep
them,'' he said.
   He said the firefighters will make up the difference with money
raised at their two-week carnival that ends Saturday.
   Barbara Andrews of Rochester, N.H., won a raffle for the first
young pony that emerged from the channel Wednesday. But she asked
that the animal be returned to its island home.
   ``He belongs here,'' she said, momentarily forgetting she had
won a female pony. ``We don't want him to be separated.''
   Tim Huddleston of Cookeville, Tenn., said he came to show the
ponies to his horse-loving children, Tiffany, 9, and Chad, 6.
   ``They read the books and came in town and saw the movie and
been over here since 5 o'clock this morning,'' he said.

   A Senate panel on Wednesday approved
legislation to limit civil contempt-of-court jailings in the
District of Columbia, but one senator said he may try to make the
bill apply only to the woman whose case prompted it.
   The Governmental Affairs Committee voted 13-0 to set a 12-month
cap on civil contempt-of-court jailings in child custody cases in
the district.
   However, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said he may introduce an
amendment on the Senate floor to limit the bill to the case of Dr.
Elizabeth Morgan.
   ``I don't want to limit the power of a judge, and that is what
this is all about,'' Rudman said. ``This would never have come
before the Congress if Dr. Morgan had not been in jail.''
   Morgan, a plastic surgeon, was jailed in August 1987 by a local
judge who said she would remain confined until she produced her
daughter Hilary for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich,
her ex-husband and the girl's father. Morgan has alleged that
Foretich has sexually abused the girl, but he has denied it.
   The child custody dispute has become a rallying point for
women's rights groups and organizations concerned with child abuse
who have come to Morgan's defense, while Foretich has won the
support of various men's groups.
   Rudman said he was reluctant to interfere with the district's
court system and expressed concern that capping all child custody
contempt-of-court jailings could eventually allow persons guilty of
child abuse to go free.
   However, Rudman said he would drop his plans for the amendment
if he felt it would prevent the bill from being passed before
Congress goes into recess on Aug. 5.
   Should the bill pass the Senate, it will have to go before a
House-Senate panel to work out differences between a version that
passed the House last month and the more narrowly drawn Senate
measure.
   The House bill would set a 12-month cap on all civil contempt
jailings, but the Senate version, introduced by Utah Republican
Orrin Hatch, would establish the limit only for civil contempt
child custody jailings.

   Democrats on Wednesday blocked a
Republican-proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning as
they pursued passage of a regular statute they say can do the same
thing without altering the Bill of Rights.
   The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, ruled out of order an attempt by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., to bring before the committee the amendment backed by
President Bush.
   Supporters of the amendment contend that changing the
Constitution is the only way to overcome last month's ruling by the
Supreme Court that flag-burning was a protected form of free
expression.
   Democratic leaders, including Brooks and House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., are pursuing a regular statute designed to meet the
court's objections.
   Their strategy is aimed at avoiding damage to constitutional
rights and demonstrating that Democrats abhor flag burning. The
symbolism of the flag was used by Bush in last year's presidential
campaign against the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   Brooks scheduled another meeting of the panel for Thursday to
take action on his proposed bill to outlaw desecration of the flag,
including burning, with penalties of up to a year in jail plus a
fine. The bill could come before the full House next week.
   ``It is my firm believe that a statute punishing flag burning...
can be drafted in a way that is consistent with the Supreme Court's
decision,'' said Brooks. A statute could be approved much more
quickly than an amendment, which requires ratification by the
states, he said.
   However, Sensenbrenner pointed out that even some opponents of
amending the Constitution don't believe a regular statute can undo
what the court decided.
   ``This is nonsense, and a ridiculous way to solve the problem
and a cop-out on our legislative responsibilities,'' he said. The
issue won't ``go away,'' he said, and blocking the constitutitonal
amendment ``is going to come back soon enough to haunt those who
made the decision.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the committee's
constitutional rights subcommittee, said he was convinced from mail
he was receiving that the public was becoming less enthralled with
the idea of a constitutional amendment.
   ``I believe we must act in the way that causes least violence to
the First Amendment, least damage to the Bill of Rights that for
200 years has made us the envy of the world,'' he said.
   The assertion by Democratic leaders that public support for an
amendment was beginning to lag in recent days was challenged as
``self-deception'' on Wednesday in the Senate by Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``The simple truth is that the vast majority of the American
people want a constitutional amendment,'' Dole said, citing 400
letters and petition he has received on the issue.
   The Senate has scheduled action in October on both a statute and
a constitutional amendment on flag burning.

   The PLO is ready to accept Israel's plan for
elections in the occupied lands if the government agrees to certain
conditions, including the principle of trading land for peace,
legislators said today.
   The new PLO position is a considerable softening of the
organization's earlier policy of rejecting the peace plan unless
Israel first withdraws its forces from the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Lawmaker Avraham Burg of the left-leaning Labor Party said
Israel learned of the PLO's latest views from a U.S. government
document outlining the organization's reaction to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's election plan.
   The document was relayed to Israel by Soviet envoy Gennady
Terrasov, who met an aide to Vice Premier Shimon Peres this week in
Paris, said an Israeli official who insisted on anonymity.
   In Washington, Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, denied there is such a document. But she said:
``Obviously we have been working with all sides to support the
election concept and to initiate a dialogue between Israelis and
Palestinians... We are pressing for movement in this regard.''
   Another Labor legislator, Aryeh Eliav, said the PLO's positions
were also relayed by two aides to PLO chief Yasser Arafat during a
conference in Vienna this month.
   ``At this conference, I definitely heard from the PLO
representatives that they are ready for elections if Israel will
say in one way or the other that at the end of the process, Israel
is ready to trade territories for peace,'' Eliav told The
Associated Press. ``They said this very clearly.''
   The PLO demands also include allowing Arab residents in
Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem to vote in the elections.
   Ms. Tutwiler said, ``The PLO has told us privately, as it has
said publicly, that it supports the election concept as part of a
comprehensive peace plan. However, the PLO has put a number of
conditions on its support for elections which would prejudge the
outcome of a negotiated solution.''
   She said the conditions include an independent Palestinian state
as a guaranteed outcome and that such conditions ``are not
acceptable to us. This is a key issue which we continue to discuss
in our dialogue with the PLO.''
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes the land-for-peace
formula and allowing Arabs in east Jerusalem to vote. The
left-leaning Labor Party accepts those conditions.
   Israel's peace initiative calls for electing Palestinians in the
occupied territories to negotiate with Israel on an interim
self-rule plan, with talks to be held later on the final status of
the territories.
   On Tuesday, a pro-PLO Palestinian lawyer, Jamil Tarifi, said he
had met with Shamir to discuss the plan. Shamir has denied meeting
with pro-PLO Palestinians.
   Leftist legislator Yossi Sarid said Tarifi was a PLO member.
Tarifi refused to say if he was a PLO member.
   Tarifi said he told Shamir to deal with the PLO.
   ``The PLO will accept it (the plan), or it will not be
acceptable to the Palestinian people,'' he said he told Shamir.
   Shamir maintains the government has no contacts with the PLO,
but a leading Labor Party official said today Israel already was
negotiating indirectly with it.
   ``The fact that there are negotiations on this subject with the
PLO is clear and it has one aim, to get a green light from the PLO
for elections in the territories,'' Yossi Beilin, an aide to Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, said on Israel army radio.
   He said the contacts were through the United States, Egypt and
Romania.
   According to Israeli sources, the PLO already has proposed
forming a delegation of 10 residents from the territories and two
Palestinian-Americans to meet with Israeli officials to discuss the
elections proposal.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the team
would eventually emerge as candidates in the elections and be
assured victory because of PLO backing.
   According to the sources and newspaper reports, other conditions
set by the PLO included:
   _Army withdrawal to predetermined positions on election day.
   _Allowing international observers to watch the voting. The
Jerusalem Post said a new element was PLO agreement to an
Egyptian-American ``coordinating team'' fulfilling this role
instead of U.N. supervision.
   _Israeli assurance that Palestinian candidates would have
freedom of speech and immunity from prosecution.
   _Acceptance by Israel of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242
and 338, which call on Israel to give up occupied land, and
Israel's recognition of the political rights of the Palestinian
people.

   A bus filled with gamblers bound
for Atlantic City's casinos overturned this morning, injuring at
least 10 people seriously, police and hospital officials said.
   The Saddle River Tours bus overturned shortly before 11:30 a.m.,
blocking both southbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway, Trooper
John Zulawski said. He said troopers at the scene counted 37 people
aboard.
   But paramedics said 47 to 50 people were taken from the bus to
five hospitals with injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to
broken ribs.
   Sherry Spatz, a spokeswoman for Atlantic City Medical Center's
mainland division, said 10 people suffered serious injuries, but
she could not provide details.
   The passengers were mostly elderly people who had boarded the
bus at Rutherford in northern New Jersey and were bound for Caesars
Atlantic City casino hotel, police and hospital officials said.
   There was no immediate explanation of what caused the bus to
turn on its side.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the Lodi-based bus company
would not talk about the incident. She hung up before giving her
name.
   Zulawski said traffic was being diverted off the parkway at the
Smithville exit, just north of the Atlantic City exit.

   Tired and buffeted by
strong winds, paraplegic mountain climber Mark Wellman was on the
verge today of conquering El Capitan.
   Wellman and his climbing partner, Mike Corbett, began their
final ascent at 7:30 a.m. after spending the night tied into
sleeping bags on Chickenhead Ledge about 300 from the summit of the
sheer granite mountain.
   By 9:30 a.m., the two had scaled 125 feet, said park spokeswoman
Lisa Dapprich. Wellman, whose legs are paralyzed, and his longtime
friend Corbett expected to pull themselves over the top by
mid-afternoon today, the eighth day of their climb, said Dapprich.
   In radio conversation with the men this morning, Dapprich said
Wellman remarked, ``We're looking forward to getting on top and
getting a hot meal.''
   Dapprich said she asked the climbers Tuesday how they were
feeling and Wellman said, `We're feeling OK, just tired and sore.'''
   Wellman, who pulled himself up six inches at a time on ropes
placed by Corbett, tried to become the first paraplegic to make the
climb.
   The biggest problem the climbers faced was the wind, which they
noted had been gusting from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day, sometimes
blowing them 10 feet out from the cliff face.
   ``After five or six days, you get summit fever _ all you can
think of is the top,'' said Corbett in a radio conversation with a
park ranger Tuesday. ``I think when we get to the top, it will feel
like I received a gold medal.''
   Wellman said his powerful hands were swollen but that he was not
injured during his quest. He estimated it would take 7,000 pullups
to reach the summit.
   Wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50
feet during a climb of the 13,700-foot Gables Peak south of
Yosemite in 1982. He was in the hospital for seven months but has
since been active, staying in shape with sports such as kayaking
and directing the park's program for disabled visitors.
   Corbett had a record 41 ascents of El Capitan before the climb
with Wellman, a world record for climbing the 3,200-foot face of
the rock outcropping.
   He said he was unable to go to sleep Monday night after hearing
that members of his estranged family in Houston would arrive in
Yosemite sometime this weekend.
   The family heard about the climb and recognized Corbett, who
last talked to them in 1981. His younger brother said in a
television interview Tuesday that he considers his brother ``a
hero.''
   ``I named both of my sons after him - that should give an idea
of how I feel about him,'' Tony Corbett, of Houston, told NBC news.
   Corbett told his girlfriend that he left his family in Houston
after a ``really traumatic'' divorce by his parents.

   Police said Wednesday they were investigating the
death of a man who was fatally injured after being hit by a turnip
that was thrown from a passing car.
   The attack apparently was carried out by a gang who toss
vegetables at random at passers-by. Another man suffered stomach
injuries in April after being hit by a cabbage, police said.
   Leslie Merry, 56, died Sunday, nine days after he was hit in the
back by a turnip that knocked him to the ground as he walked near
his home in London's East End, Scotland Yard said. He had a broken
rib and ruptured spleen and died from respiratory problems.
   ``It sounds very amusing but clearly it is not because a man has
died and we are treating this very seriously indeed,'' police said.

<TEXT>
   Africa's leaders called Wednesday
for Western nations to emulate the United States and France and
write off the continent's official foreign debt.
   The leaders, closing the annual summit of the 50-nation
Organization of African Unity, also urged the international
community to develop ``a more comprehensive strategy to address all
aspects of Africa's debt problems, both official and commercial
loans, on an enduring basis.''
   Heads of state and ranking ministers of 42 member states had
made Africa's foreign debt of $230 billion the dominant theme of
their meeting in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.
   Africa's economy, never healthy, has been in decline for the
past decade.
   Leaders said the industrialized nations should follow the
example of Washington and Paris, which have written off large sums
of African debt.
   While unanimous on the need for an urgent bail-out, some
delegates, including Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, noted a
lot of past financial help has been squandered through corruption
and waste.
   The summit's resolution on debt also called for special relief
from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. They called
for the Western-funded institutions to create and direct an agency
to purchase outstanding African debts at discount rates.
   Also Wednesday, Tanzania's Deputy Prime Minister Salim A. Salim,
was elected secretary-general of the organization.
   Salim, who also is defense minister, defeated a bid by Idi
Oumarou of Niger to serve a second four-year term in a tight
contest that threatened to split the organization.
   Under a pre-arranged agreement, Oumarou withdrew after a second
secret ballot showed Salim with a four-vote edge.
   In other resolutions Wednesday, Africa's leaders:
   _ Called for creation of an African Economic Community, an idea
they have discussed for years with little result.
   _ Urged President Bush's administration to end military and
financial aid to rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   They also approved a long list of resolutions adopted by foreign
ministers in a preliminary meeting last week.
   Among other things, those resolutions reiterated the
organization's demands for mandatory, worldwide sanctions against
South Africa and condemned Israel for its occupation of southern
Lebanon and for what the Africans termed its aggression and
terrorism against Palestinian residents of the occupied Gaza Strip
and West Bank.

<HEAD>Military Cuts Drug Use, Moves Into Domestic Drug Interdiction Arena</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military has sharply cut drug use in its
own ranks and made significant progress in aiding drug interdiction
efforts in the United States, a Pentagon official said Wednesday.
   Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen M. Duncan said drug use
among U.S. military personnel has dropped from 27 percent in 1980
to 4.8 percent last year, largely due to drug testing.
   Duncan, the department's coordinator for drug enforcement policy
and support, also said the Pentagon is helping National Guard units
across the country to detect and monitor drug activities and using
its own resources for domestic interdiction efforts.
   But Duncan skirted questions at a news conference about the
military's possible future role in fighting cocaine at its South
American origins.
   ``We've had no guidance from the president yet,'' Duncan said.
When pressed, he added: ``We're not going to do anything without
the knowledge and support of the host government.''
   A National Security Council report on drugs reportedly
recommends an increased role for the U.S. armed forces in drug
interdiction in South America.
   President Bush, in pre-election speeches, pledged to fight
domestic cocaine use by taking action in Peru and Bolivia, where
the majority of the world's coca grows in the Andes mountains.
   But Peru's Maoist guerrillas presented a ``security threat'' to
American workers, the State Department said, and the programs have
been all but stopped since February. The tough coca plants continue
to produce four harvests a year, most of which ends up as processed
cocaine on U.S. streets.
   An administration source recently described direct U.S. military
involvement in drug interdiction in South America as ``effectively
a dead issue'' because none of the drug-producing nations would
``invite'' American troops.
   A comprehensive plan expected to include the military's overall
role in fighting drugs is due in September from the office of drug
policy coordinator William Bennett.
   Under a recent law, the Defense Department is the lead agency
for detecting and monitoring all air and sea drug activities. The
actual interdiction is done by other agencies, primarily the
Customs Service and the Coast Guard.
   Duncan noted the Pentagon's assistance to the National Guard for
drug interdiction, saying 52 plans submitted by the governors of
states and territories had received approval for part of a $40
million parcel earmarked for such programs.
   The guardsmen have been working mostly along the Southern border
with civilian law enforcement agencies to detect and monitor drug
smugglers. But states from Maine to Missouri as well as Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands have set up acceptable drug programs.
   ``This is the first time the Guard has been used in this way,''
Duncan said.
   Duncan also said the armed forces supplied 28,000 flight hours,
2,000 ship days and $300 million in equipment loans for its new
role in drug interdiction.
   ``I believe we've made significant progress,'' he said. ``I
think the American people need to understand, while there's a lot
we can do, we're not a law enforcement agency.''
   The General Accounting Office in June issued a report
criticizing the Pentagon's air effort, with its harshest comments
about the aerostat ballons intended to detect incoming planes. The
report said the ballons have trouble distinguishing the low,
slow-flying planes used by drug traffickers from ``surface
clutter.''
   Duncan said the Pentagon would ask Congress to increase its drug
budget from $308 million to $317.6 million for drug interdiction
assistance and from $112 million to 117.5 million for demand
reduction.

   Sixty-two children were rushed to hospitals
Wednesday, complaining of stomach cramps and nausea after eating
lunch at a youth center, officials said. Some were driven on
commandeered city buses.
   Hospital officials at Orlando Regional Medical Center, Humana
Hospital and AMI Medical Center reported no life-threatening
problems.
   The children reportedly ate a lunch of ham and cheese sandwiches
and pears provided by a food service company contracted by city
schools.
   Dave Hurley, field coordinator for the Department of Emergency
Services, said the children _ ages 4 to 16 _ were primarily treated
with fluids in efforts to contain possible dehydration.
   Joe Brown, spokesman for Orlando Regional Medical Center, said
29 children were treated there. They were brought in by public
transit buses commandeered by rescue personnel called to the
Frontline Outreach youth center.
   Seventeen children were taken to Humana Hospital, and 16 to AMI
by emergency vehicles.
   Most were expected to be released to their parents, officials
said.
   Frontline Outreach sponsors a series of athletic, social,
counseling and education programs for young people.

   The House voted today to slow the costly
stealth bomber program but refused to scrap the radar-evading
warplane altogether.
   Choosing between competing amendments, lawmakers adopted,
257-160, a measure by Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and Mike Synar,
D-Okla., that would limits the administration to fund production of
only two bombers in 1990 and 1991. The Pentagon had sought eight
bombers.
   The amendment to a defense authorization bill would meet the
full request for research and development work over that period but
imposes ``a cold-turkey fence of the procurement money until
Congress acts again,'' said Aspin, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   Essentially, the amendment puts off for a full year a final
decision on whether to fully fund the program until more evidence
is in on the effectiveness and cost of the bomber.
   The Senate voted 98-1 Tuesday to back the $530 million B-2
stealth bomber if it meets flight test and radar-evasion standards
and trimmed President Bush's $2.1 billion stealth request by a
relatively modest $300 million.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Bush was pleased with
that action but would continue to push for full funding of the
plane in the final version of the defense bill that Congress
produces.
   Present plans call for production of 132 stealth bombers. The
estimated $70 billion price tag of the program became the focal
point of the debate.
   ``There's no way, no chance to go ahead with the program the way
it's laid out,'' Aspin told the House. ``This amendment tells the
Air Force, go back restructure the program and come up with a
cheaper program with less than 132 aircraft. It gives us a chance
to test this plane enough to know whether we want to go to full
production.''
   A total of 208 Democrats and 49 Republicans voted for the
amendment, while 38 Democrats and 122 Republicans voted against it.
   Before that vote, the House rejected amendments that would have
the effect of either scrapping or backing the stealth program.
   It defeated, 244-176, an amendment by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,
which endorsed the program, adopted an $800 million cut approved by
the House Armed Services Committee and imposed flight-testing and
radar-evasion standards and restrictions.
   On a 279-144 roll call it defeated an amendment sponsored by
Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and John Kasich, R-Ohio, which would
complete research and development work on the stealth program but
stop further production.
   In debate, foes of the radar-evading plane attacked it as an
overly expensive and unneeded weapon whose only purpose is ``to
make the rubble bounce'' after a nuclear exchange.
   But defenders of the project said the stealth is an essential
component of the U.S. drive to negotiate deep cuts in Soviet and
American missiles. They said the weapon system will stabilize
East-West tensions because, unlike a missile, it can be recalled
after it is launched.
   As debate opened today, Aspin told the House: ``We've hardly
tested this plane. What this amendment does is say, slow down the
program, do the research and development and fence the program.''
   He said this approach would provide time to ``come up with a
program that is politically acceptable and more affordable.''
   Rep. Joseph Brennan, D-Maine, contended the stealth would be
used only after an exchange of nuclear-armed missiles resulting in
devastation in both the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``By that time the war would be lost,'' Brennan said. ``A
mission to make the rubble bounce does not justify this spending,''
Brennan said.
   But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the purpose of a
second-strike radar-penetrating, second-strike weapons such as
stealth is to deter the Soviets from launching a first strike.
   ``The bomber gives you flexibility,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks,
D-Wash. ``You can't do it with cruise missiles because many of
those (Soviet) targets are mobile targets. It's the combination of
a penetrating bomber and the stand-off cruise missile carriers
which makes obsolete the $400 billion Soviet investment in air
defense.''
   Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., predicted cost overruns will push
the price of the stealth from $500 million each to $1 billion each.
   ``Let's vote yes for sanity,'' he said, urging support for
killing the program.
   Also pending were amendments to eliminate the MX mobile missile
and the competing single-warhead Midgetman missile. The
administration has requested $1.1 billion to place MX missiles on
railroad cars and $100 million to develop the Midgetman. Both the
Senate and House Armed Services committees approved the
administration's request.
   The Senate was to resume full debate on the defense bill
Thursday.

<HEAD>Critics Say Sanctions Fail to Pressure Noriega Regime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. economic sanctions against Panama are so
riddled with exceptions and loopholes that they have failed to put
decisive pressure on the regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega,
congressional critics of the policy said Wednesday.
   The administration opponents pointed to a study by the General
Accounting Office, Congress' investigating arm, that found the
sanctions policy poorly planned, relatively unenforced and porous
enough to let millions of dollars continue to flow to Noriega's
regime.
   ``There can be no doubt that our policy has been
counterproductive,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs economic policy subcommittee.
   Because of fear of harming U.S. businesses still operating in
Panama, the Reagan and Bush administrations have granted numerous
exceptions to rules intended to bar payments to Noriega's
government, he said. The aim was to protect business while forcing
the military strongman from power.
   ``Since the administration was not fully committed to either
goal, we have failed to accomplish either one,'' Gejdenson said.
``We still have Noriega, and we have severely damaged both U.S. and
Panamanian businesses and the economy of Panama.''
   But Republicans on the subcommittee objected, saying any talk of
ending the sanctions would only strengthen Noreiga. And they said
the sanctions have had some effect, denying the regime some $125
million in revenues last year, according to the GAO report.
   ``The purpose of the sanctions was never to punish U.S.
companies,'' said Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif. ``Exceptions
were made to prevent undue hardship on Americans living and working
in Panama.''
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., dismissed the entire hearing as ``a
Bush-bashing expedition by this committee.''
   The sanctions grew out of riots in the summer of 1987, when the
U.S. Embassy was damaged and U.S. military and economic aid to
Panama were suspended. Later, Panama's lucrative quota for selling
sugar in the United States at subsidized prices was suspended, and
Washington weighed in against new loans to Panama by international
development banks.
   Noreiga was indicted on drug charges in Florida early in 1988
and the United States recognized Eric Arturo Delvalle as the
country's legitimate president, and gave him control over frozen
Panamanian funds in U.S. banks.
   In June 1988, the administration sought to escalate the
sanctions by barring payments by U.S. firms to the Noriega
government. Tax and trade-related payments were to be diverted
instead to a Federal Reserve Bank escrow account.
   But even before the regulations for the new rules were
announced, exceptions were being drafted. Eventually, some 46
exceptions were granted that had the effect of letting more than
half the payments flow through to the Noriega regime, the GAO said.
   In a related matter, the GAO also found that a mysterious $1
million payment was released to Delvalle from a Federal Reserve
Bank account in New York after it was requested by Elliott Abrams,
then the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which had
control over the money, had objected to Abrams that the payment
fell outside the scope of a budget permitting the account to be
used to pay operating expenses for Panama's U.S. Embassy and five
consulates.
   But the money was permitted to flow after Abrams in effect took
responsibility for the release of the funds, assuring Treasury
cryptically that it was ``for appropriate official use by the
recognized government of Panama.''
   The GAO was unable to get from Abrams or the State Department an
explanation of the purpose of the money, said Frank C. Conahan,
assistant comptroller general for national security and
international affairs.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flour, salt, cheese and other staples are
in such short supply that one newspaper printed a woeful shopping
map of Poland and another listed the difficulties under the
headline, ``City on Vacation, People Remain.''
   Lines are longer and supplies even shorter because of the stores
closed for lack of staff, due in part to long summer vacations _
many Polish workers are entitled to six weeks _ and in part to
employees simply giving up their jobs because the pay is so low.
   Residents of one Warsaw neighborhood were told to pick up their
own mail at the post office for several days because there weren't
enough mail carriers.
   The shortages have grown worse this summer as Poland's economic
turmoil continues, inflation soars and a price freeze for some
products empties the shelves in anticipation of more expensive
goods while lowering production.
   Supplies of fruit and vegetables appear plentiful at Warsaw
stands but prices are high, since most come from private farmers
rather than state-regulated enterprises.
   The deteriorating market situation comes as the Common Market
prepares for an Aug. 1 meeting to coordinate emergency food
shipments to Poland, intended to provide the government with
breathing room to pursue economic and political reforms.
   These including shifting Poland toward a ``market-oriented
economy,'' reducing the government subsidies needed to bridge the
gulf between prices of many basic products and the cost of making
them.
   Some changes are supposed to begin Aug. 1, when a freeze on
wages and prices is to be lifted _ as well as a possible
elimination of meat rationing _ expected to lead to enormous demand
and much higer prices.
   Under the headline ``Where There is None _ An Economic Map of
Poland,'' the opposition daily Gazeta Wyborcza plotted the course
of shortages.
   In industrial southwestern Poland, according to the map, there
is no meat, sugar, salt, oil, vinegar or cotton wool. In the
northeastern vacation area, there is no sugar, tea or cheese.
   In the northwest, ``There is sugar'' the map proclaims.
   Around the port city of Gdansk, ``Nie Ma Nic,'' _ ``There's
nothing.''
   The official Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawa offered Wednesday's
readers a front-page litany of closed stores, shortages and long
lines waiting hours for possible meat deliveries.
   In one neighborhood, four out of five groceries were closed due
to shortages, lack of staff or ``water pipe repairs,'' and the open
one had little to sell.
   There were 120 people on line for meat at one market, 60 in the
regular line and an equal number in the ``privileged'' queue for
the elderly, pregnant women and others with special needs.
   ``We know about the difficulties with supply and we know about
shortages, although we don't understand them, especially if they
concern sugar, flour, not to mention salt,'' the newspaper said.
   ``But we also know that we feel the horrible lack of
organization and imagination of the people who are responsible for
trade, starting with the minister.''
   All of this ``leads us to the edge of endurance,'' the article
said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher on
Wednesday defended the Bush administration against congressional
criticism that consumers could be hurt by the administration's
efforts to modify antitrust laws.
   Mosbacher said the administration would ``very soon'' present
Congress with its recommendations for ways to change the antitrust
laws to allow American companies to compete globally in the field
of high-technology products.
   The administration is considering a major relaxation of
antitrust laws that would allow companies to jointly produce
high-technology products, such as high-definition television sets.
   This would expand on an action taken by Congress in 1984 when it
changed the antitrust laws to allow companies to engage in joint
research efforts.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, told
Mosbacher that he had reservations about the need to further weaken
the antitrust statutes by allowing joint production as well as
joint research.
   Brooks said this was a ``more difficult question because it
raises issues about concerted behavior in the marketplace, not the
laboratory.''
   Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., called the proposal for an
antitrust exemption for manufacturing a ``much more radical
approach'' than the research exemption and he predicted that it
would encounter substantial congressional esistance.
   Smith said such an approach could allow American companies to
form giant monopolies that would boost prices to the detriment of
consumers.
   But Mosbacher said these arguments missed the point that
American companies were being forced to compete globally in the
development of new technology with foreign businesses that faced
for fewer antitrust restrictions.
   ``The entire industrial world is now in competition. We will
either adjust to that reality or we will not survive as a great
power,'' he told the committee.
   Mosbacher said that the administration was still considering
exactly what types of antitrust changes to propose to Congress.
   ``I think we will be pulling our act together very soon,'' he
said.
   In response to a question, Mosbacher said he did not think it
was proper to exclude foreign-owned companies from participating in
joint ventures in the United States.
   He said any antitrust exclusions should also be applied across
the board, rather than limited to just smaller firms, as some in
Congress have proposed.
   Mosbacher said it was crucial to America's future prosperity to
allow more joint ventures as a way of allowing companies to spread
the risks and costs of developing complex new technologies.
   ``Legislation aimed at reducing antitrust uncertainty could
allow American firms to move confidently into new technological
fields, thereby enhancing U.S. competitiveness,'' he said.
   Mosbacher said the administration's proposal would not be a
``backdoor attempt to undermine the antitrust laws and the
competitive, free enterprise economy they seek to protect.''

<HEAD>Developer of Artificial Heart Needs Money for Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dentist who designed an experimental
artificial heart that was used in a human without federal approval
says he's improved his air-driven Phoenix Heart but needs money for
further development and testing.
   Kevin Cheng believes his latest versions are superior to
anything else in use.
   But he is unable to finance costly animal testing to prove his
devices work, which could bring federal approval for experimental
use in humans, or to develop a fully implantable and internally
driven heart.
   Cheng said he needs at least $300,000 for animal testing and may
have to try to find foreign backers for testing overseas,
mentioning Japan and the Republic of China.
   Cheng, who has sought federal and private grants without
success, says his last best hope for testing in the United States
rests with the University of Arizona in Tucson. But while he has
supporters there, federal support is unlikely for another
air-driven heart pump because it involves old technology.
   Such devices, including current Jarvik hearts, are powered by
external machines that pump air through tubes that pass through the
patient's chest wall. The patient is tethered and susceptible to
infections because of the tubes.
   Cheng, 46, achieved notoriety in March 1985 when an earlier
Phoenix Heart intended for calf testing was used at University
Medical Center, which is affiliated with the Tucson school, in an
emergency without the federal Food and Drug Administration's
authorization.
   The Phoenix Heart kept a patient whose body had rejected a donor
heart alive for 11 hours before a second transplant. The man died
of complications unrelated to the device.
   Dr. Jack G. Copeland, the UMC surgeon who arranged its use,
afterward acquired FDA-approved Jarvik-7s and pioneered their use
as bridges to keep patients alive until transplants are available.
Jarvik hearts, which were permanently implanted in five recipients
in the United States and Sweden, have since been used as transplant
bridges about 150 times in the United States.
   Between 1983 and 1987, Cheng implanted his devices in 10 calves
for as long as 10 days, but expenses forced their shutoff. Each
polyurethane heart costs $15,000.
   In the meantime, Cheng is at a standstill with virtually no
testing accomplished on his new designs, elliptical, polyurethane
Phoenix-7 and -8 models.
   He insists his design is superior to the Jarvik hearts, with
greater blood volume per stroke and slightly smaller size.
   The Phoenix Heart's three pumping membranes, versus the Jarvik's
one, will effectively remove all blood from the ventricle, ``and no
one else has done that yet,'' said Dr. Willem J. Kolff, one of the
nation's most respected artificial heart researchers.
   Kolff developed the first successful kidney dialysis machine and
is chief of the University of Utah's Division or Artificial Organs,
where the Jarvik heart was developed.
   Cheng's heart ``is novel, it's promising, it's unusual,'' Kolff
said. ``I see no reason why it should not work. It should be
tested.''
   If the Phoenix Heart were available and fully tested today,
``I'd say we could put it in instead of the Jarvik'' in bridge
situations, said Richard Smith, chief biomedical engineer at UMC.
But he said he thought it would be more useful for Cheng to work
toward a permanent, totally implantable heart with an internal
motor.
   Cheng's ultimate goal is a completely implantable
electro-hydraulic artificial heart, using currently available
technology, to provide patient mobility and a quality of life
lacking when tethered to an air-driven pump.
   Cheng, who worked at the Texas Heart Institute while in dental
school, said he wants to complete his 12-year-old project, which
has cost him $200,000, ``to save some human life.''

   Thousands of rail workers on Wednesday broke
Britain's sixth national rail strike in six weeks, British Rail
said, but most commuters still had to get to work without trains.
   The work stoppage halted service on much of the national rail
network. In addition, the 12th one-day walkout in 16 weeks by
London subway workers shut down the London Underground.
   The strikers are demanding higher wages.
   Thousands of commuters walked, cycled or jogged to work.
Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson walked 1{ miles to Parliament.
   Two royal parks in London, Hyde Park and Regent's Park, served
as emergency parking lots.
   British Rail said Wednesday that 12,500 of the National Union of
Railwaymen's 75,000 employees showed up for work, but just 400 of
its normal 16,000 rail services operated.
   The union said British Rail's figures on strikebreakers were
inflated, but it did not offer estimates of its own.
   The first three trains into London carried just 15 passengers,
and rail union leader Jimmy Knapp mocked British Rail's attempts to
break the strike.
   ``It's a pitiful return for the amount of money, time and effort
they spent over the past week trying to persuade, cajole and
threaten people back into work,'' Knapp said.
   Commuter Douglas Wallace said he was the only person to board
the train at his local station at Hither Green, seven miles
southeast of London.
   ``I was the only passenger standing at the station, and when it
arrived, they said, `This is a train for you. Get on it,''' he said.
   The rail union paid for advertisements in several newspapers
Tuesday seeking to boost flagging support among its members.
   The Financial Times business daily quoted some rail workers as
saying they wanted to accept management's offer of an 8.8 percent
increase in basic pay. The union is seeking a 10 percent increase
in the basic wage of $188 a week.
   The 8.8 percent offer has been accepted by two other railway
unions.
   Subway workers are seeking a $103 weekly pay raise to operate
subway trains without conductors. Management has offered $48 a week
plus extra vacation time, but it is demanding increased production.
   About 9,400 dockworkers at London ports have been on strike
since July 10. Port officials say the strike is crumbling, with
only 37 of the 60 ports involved still idled.
   The dock strike began after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government abolished a jobs-for-life guarantee,
enacted in 1947, for dockers at the 60 ports.
   A major cause of the labor unrest has been Britain's annual
inflation rate of 8.3 percent, the highest in the 12-nation
European Economic Community.

<HEAD>Fugitive Nazi War Criminal Discovered in Switzerland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WUPPERTAL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nazi war criminal known as the
``William Tell of Auschwitz'' for forcing prisoners to balance tin
cans on their heads before shooting them has been arrested in
Switzerland, officials said Wednesday.
   Gottfried Weise, 69, was arrested at a hospital in the Swiss
community of Thun, where he had sought treatment for a stroke, said
Horst Rosenbaum, Wuppertal's chief prosecutor. Weise had
disappeared from West Germany three months earlier.
   The head of the Thun regional hospital, Beat Straubhaar, said
Weise had been in the facility's care for two weeks under the name
of Sieber.
   The hospital chief said Weise disclosed that he was sought in
West Germany, and hospital authorities summoned police. Weise
indicated to hospital workers that he would voluntarily return to
West Germany without extradition, Straubhaar said.
   Weise was transferred to a prison hospital in Bern after his
arrest.
   He was convicted on Jan. 28, 1988, by a Wuppertal court of
killing at least five prisoners in 1944 while a guard at the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   Weise had been allowed to remain at his home near Wuppertal
pending appeal to care for his sick wife. His disappearance was
discovered April 20 when police went to arrest him to begin serving
his sentence.
   Rosenbaum said it was a mystery how Weise was able to make his
way to Switzerland, as his passport had been confiscated.
   ``We suspect he stayed with Swiss or German friends in the area
of Thun,'' Rosenbaum said.
   During his trial, Weise became known as the ``William Tell of
Auschwitz.'' Witnesses testified that he forced an 8-year-old boy
and a 17-year-old girl to balance tin cans on their heads _
apparently making them believe that he would aim at the cans _ and
then fired shots at the two, killing them.
   He was convicted of their deaths and of killing two male
prisoners who tried to escape by hiding in a supply truck. Weise
also was convicted of killing an inmate for responding too slowly
to orders.

<TEXT>
   Iran's main radical figures urged their
countrymen Wednesday to participate in this week's presidential
elections, even though their main rival, Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, is expected to win.
   Their declarations suggested they want to avoid a head-on
collision with Rafsanjani, who has emerged as the country's most
popular leader.
   State-run Tehran Radio quoted Ahmad Khomeini, the son of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as saying that if his father were
alive, he would have been the first to cast a vote in Friday's
elections.
   ``God willing, on July 28, the dear people of Iran will throng
to the polls with steady stride,'' the broadcast quoted Khomeini as
saying.
   ``In doing so, they will gladden the hearts of our friends and
send our enemies to the dust of dismay,'' he said.
   Khomeini's son is considered the leader of Iranian radicals. His
group has been jockeying for power with pragmatists, led by
Rafsanjani, since the ayatollah died June 3.
   There had been speculation Khomeini would declare himself a
candidate for president against Rafsanjani, leading to an open
fight for power. However, radicals have shown more flexibility in
recent weeks in an apparent effort to avoid a direct challenge of
Rafsanjani.
   Hard-line Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, interviewed separately
by the radio, called for a ``massive turnout.''
   ``The government of the Islamic Republic considers voting in the
elections as a divine and national duty and will mobilize all its
capabilities for better holding of them,'' he said.
   Polls published by some newspapers predicted Rafsanjani will
take 86 percent of the votes.
   The same polls gave his only challenger, Abbas Sheibani, 11
percent while saying 3 percent of the Iranians questioned intend
not to vote.
   Iran's electorate was estimated at 25 million at last year's
parliamentary elections.
   Sheibani, 58, is a French-trained doctor and parliament deputy
without a national political base.
   The presidential elections were originally scheduled for Aug. 18
but were advanced to accelerate the transition of power after
Khomeini's death.
   A national referendum will be held with the presidential voting
on proposed constitutional amendments. The changes would increase
the president's powers, making him head of government and scrapping
the post of prime minister.
   The proposals are expected to win approval.

<HEAD>House GOP Whip Facing Questions About Payroll Practices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, already
awaiting a possible ethics investigation into a book promotion
deal, is facing new questions about large temporary pay raises he
gave to aides, including some who briefly resigned to become
campaign workers.
   Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the House
ethics committee, said Wednesday the panel will look into
``anything we see,'' including the possibility of payroll
irregularities, if it approves a formal investigation of Gingrich.
   Gingrich said temporary, yearend raises are commonly used by
House members to reward hard-working staffers, and he said his
decision to award such raises is not influenced by whether an aide
takes time off from the staff to work in his campaign.
   A spot check of Gingrich's House colleagues from Georgia found
that four of nine gave aides large temporary raises last year, and
one, Rep. John Lewis of Atlanta, gave an aide a 27 percent pay
increase 15 days after he returned from a two-month campaign leave.
   The disclosure of Gingrich's practice, first made in an Atlanta
business publication, comes at an awkward time for the combative
House GOP whip who submitted the ethics complaint that led to
former Speaker Jim Wright's resignation.
   Myers said the committee could meet as early as next week, and
may be ready to decide then whether to begin a formal investigation
of Gingrich. sparked by a complaint about the book deal.
   ``If we vote for a preliminary inquiry, we would look at
everything,'' Myers said when asked if the panel would investigate
Gingrich's payroll. ``As in the Jim Wright case, we would look into
anything we see.''
   House payroll records show that Gingrich gave temporary raises
to 15 staffers last fall, including two aides who took leaves for
campaign work. He gave similar raises to 13 aides in both 1987 and
1986, including two in 1986 who took leaves to work in his
re-election campaign.
   Myers said he did know whether it was a widespread practice for
House members to give aides who worked on their campaigns a
temporary raise after they returned.
   ``If true it would be troubling,'' he said. ``It would violate
the spirit of the House. We do not want to use government funds to
fund our campaigns.''
   House personnel rules state that ``yearend raises should be made
only on a permanent basis and only when the services of the
individual warrant.'' Federal law and House rules also prohibit
members from rewarding staff members for campaign work.
   The two Gingrich aides who took leaves for the 1988 campaign
were press secretary Sheila Ward, and executive assistant Sarah
Grewe. During the one-month leaves, the campaign paid Ward $1,612
and Grewe $1,262. At the pay rates in effect when they took the
leaves, Ward would have earned $1,606 and Grewe $1,500 if they had
stayed on the congressional payroll.
   After returning to the congressional payroll in mid-November, a
temporary raise gave Ward $1,979 more than she would have made the
rest of the year at her old rate. Grewe earned an additional $1,986.
   In the final quarter of the year, Ward's total salary from both
the campaign and the congressional office was $6,804, or $1,984
more than she would have made if her October pay rate had been in
effect the rest of the year. Grewe's total salary for the quarter
of $6,348, also was about 41 percent, or $1,848, more than she
would have earned at the October rate.
   The other 13 permanent members of Gingrich's congressional staff
also received large temporary raises during the final quarter of
1988, boosting their overall pay by amounts ranging from 9 percent
to 44.9 percent, or from $400 to $3,392.
   The salaries of all 15 staffers were reduced on Jan. 1, 1989,
though their new levels still ranged between 4 percent and 33
percent higher than the salaries the previous October.
   During the 1986 campaign, the two aides who took leaves were
Catherine Brock, assistant state administrator, and Katherine
Watson, a legislative assistant. During the 10-week leaves, the
campaign paid Brock $3,588 and Watson $2,141. Had they stayed on
the congressional payroll at their pre-leave pay rate, Brock would
have earned $4,140 during the 10 weeks and Watson would have earned
$4,600.
   After returning to the congressional payroll in mid-November,
temporary raises gave Brock $2,820 more in salary for the remainder
of the year than she would have earned at the pre-leave pay rate,
and Watson $2,520 more.
   In 1986, Gingrich began dispensing the temporary raises to his
staff in August. For the rest of the year, the temporary raises
boosted the total pay of the 11 other permanent staffers by amounts
ranging from $1,280 to $5,000, or from 13 percent to 67 percent.

<HEAD>Report Troops and Civilians Uncover Hidden Explosives in Kabul</HEAD>

   Afghan security forces Wednesday
discovered an 11-pound bomb hidden in a crowded Kabul vegetable
market, the government said.
   Twenty-four hours earlier, people at a state store discovered a
briefcase that also contained a cache of explosives, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   The discoveries, which could not be confirmed independently,
were reported at a time of increased rocket attacks and a car
bombing that have killed more than 200 people in Kabul this month.
Nearly all victims were civilians.
   Moslem guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-backed government
have been firing long-range rockets from behind the hills that ring
the mile-high capital.
   Also Wednesday, Amani said, security forces discovered two
rockets positioned for attack on Kabul in the northwestern
foothills.
   ``Extremists, faced with serious defeat, to save face are
resorting to terrorist activity, and a lot of innocent civilians
are falling victim to the attacks,'' he said.
   He said the explosives in the market were left in a bag beside a
shop.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas claim responsibility for rocket
attacks but not for planting explosives or car bombs.
   Security forces conducting house-to-house searches discovered
``a large quantity of arms and ammunition,'' Amani said.
   In another incident, security forces arrested a man carrying
$12,000 in forged notes, he said. Amani said this is part of the
guerrillas' ``economic sabotage'' against the government.
   Outside Kabul, he said, government forces recently killed more
than 280 guerrillas, including Pakistani army officers and six
Saudi Arabians. The two countries admit aiding the guerrillas but
deny having fighters in Afghanistan.
   Amani said government troops are pushing the guerrillas into
retreat southeast of Jalalabad, toward the town of Torxam, near the
Pakistani border. In that fighting, soldiers killed 27 guerrillas
and captured two tanks, five mortars and a large quantity of arms
and ammunition, he said.
   Jalalabad has been the scene of the fiercest fighting since
Soviet troops backing the government withdrew February under a U.N.
agreement.
   Amani said another 74 guerrillas were killed in a July 23
operation against followers of guerrilla leader Gulbaddin
Hekmatayar in western Maidan Shahr, capital of Wardak province.
   Government troops repulsing an attack outside the city by
Hekmatayar's followers killed 180 guerrillas, Amani said.
   Both sides often exaggerate reports of fighting and casualties
that are impossible to verify.

   Only one-third of President Bush's embassy
appointments are political, a White House official said Wednesday
in response to complaints that the administration is handing out
plum ambassadorial assignments as political payoffs.
   Bush's list of nominees contains the names of several people who
gave six-figure contributions to Republicans in the last election,
but White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said they were chosen on
the basis of their qualifications.
   Cooper said Secretary of State James A. Baker III is using a
formula to ensure that 67 percent of the appointments are career
government officers and 33 percent are political appointees,
brought in by the president.
   He said there is currently a greater percentage of political
appointees because some now serving are carryovers from the Reagan
administration, when the ratio was 60 percent career officers to 40
percent political appointees.
   Some Bush appointments have raised a firestorm of criticism in
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings to confirm the
ambassadors.
   Sens. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and other
Democrats have complained that the appointees lack sufficient
qualifications beyond their financial and political connections.
   At least six of the people Bush appointed to ambassadorships
gave $100,000 or more to the Republican National Committee. Their
names are listed in the RNC's so-called soft money files, which
means their donations are not subject to the $1,000 limit on
contributions to individual federal campaigns.
   Those six include Nicolas Salgo, the former ambassador to
Hungary whom Bush named to the rank of ambassador to negotiate
property issues in his job as director of the State Department's
Moscow Embassy building control office. He gave the RNC just over
$500,000 last year.
   The others who gave $100,000 are Joy Silverman, who has no job
history and was named as ambassador to Barbados and four other
Caribbean island nations; Florida real estate magnate Joseph
Zappala, named as ambassador to Spain; Louisiana oil company
executive John Giffen Weinmann as ambassador to Finland;
Mississippi developer Melvin Sembler as ambassador to Australia;
and Washington attorney Joseph B. Gildenhorn as ambassador to
Switzerland.
   Zappala narrowly won confirmation on Tuesday in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, with Sarbanes vowing to continue the
fight against him and others on the Senate floor. Zappala reported
to the committee that he gave $126,000 to Republican political
causes last year and $17,900 in the two years before that.
   Many other appointees named to ambassadorships or other
high-level administration posts were members of Bush's campaign
finance committee or gave contributions of $10,000 or more to the
RNC soft money fund.
   Cooper said Wednesday that all will make ``excellent
ambassadors'' and that each one was chosen on the basis of specific
qualifications they bring to their posts.

   An American rabbi who was beaten by Polish
workers while protesting the presence of a convent at Auschwitz
said Wednesday he will press charges against the attackers and
police who did nothing to stop them.
   Rabbi Avraham Weiss and six U.S. Jewish students were removed
from the camp in Poland and kicked and beaten by the construction
workers during a July 14 demonstration to protest the presence of
the Carmelite convent on the camp grounds.
   The international Jewish community considers Christian symbols
on the perimeter of the camp a desecration of the memory of those
who died at the Nazi concentration camp. An estimated 2.5 million
Jews were among the 4 million people killed at Auschwitz.
   ``The convent is offensive to the Jewish people. It is part of
the larger Vatican attempt to Christianize the Holocaust,'' Weiss,
of Riverdale, N.Y., said at a news conference.
   Weiss dismissed claims the convent was meant as a memorial to
Christians who died in the camp.
   ``Jews were murdered because they were Jews. Christians were
murdered because they were Polish political prisoners who happened
to be Christians,'' he said.
   Jewish groups are demanding the Carmelite nuns respect an
agreement to move. That agreement was reached by church officials
and representatives of international Jewish organizations in 1987
and originally called on the nuns to leave by February.
   They were to move to a convent that has yet to be built.
   Polish news reports have said work on the new convent will begin
next year.
   Weiss said he arrived in Israel after meeting New York Cardinal
John O'Connor, who promised to write an article supporting the
Jewish cause within the next 10 days.
   Weiss said he will be pressing charges through the Polish
representative in Israel against the Polish assailants and police
who he claimed stood by and did not intervene during the beatings.
   ``We have hired lawyers ... and we are going to be asking the
Polish representative to press charges against those citizens who
beat us. We know who they are. Their pictures were on front pages
of newspapers throughout the world,'' Weiss said.
   He added he wanted an investigation into what role the nuns
played in the incident. ``After all,'' he said, ``these
construction workers came from the convent.''
   Weiss also demanded that Israel take charge of Auschwitz as a
symbol of the Holocaust.
   ``Unless Israel is going to administer and oversee Auschwitz, it
would be impossible for Auschwitz to retain its unique message of
being ... that place where the Nazis tried to exterminate Jews.''

<HEAD>Some D.C. Ladies of the Night Rounded Up and Marched Toward Virginia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The march was short, the apparel was shorter
and tempers in neighboring Virginia were shortest.
   It seems some enterprising Washington police officers tried
something new early Tuesday to rid the downtown area of prostitutes
_ by herding 24 ladies of the night across the Potomac River toward
suburban Arlington.
   This army, more of a platoon, really, marched not on its
stomach, but on spiked heels. Not to the beat of drums, but to the
muffled rustle of vinyl hot pants and leather miniskirts.
   Still, it was like a shot heard 'round the commonwealth, which,
notwithstanding the ``Welcome to Virginia'' sign on the far side of
the river, was mightily displeased by this latest export from the
city bearing the name of the state's favorite son.
   ``This is the fourth commodity the District (of Columbia)
exports to Virginia,'' snapped Rep. Stan Parris. ``We get all the
sludge, all the garbage, most of the prisoners and now their
prostitutes.''
   A fellow Virginia Republican, Sen. John Warner, took to the
Senate floor to denounce the forced march of the prostitutes as
``an indignity to the Commonwealth of Virginia.'' He demanded that
Mayor Marion Barry discipline those involved in ``this incredible,
almost unbelievable episode, in law enforcement.''
   ``This isn't for real, is it?'' said Arlington Police Chief
William K. Stover. ``I've been in this business for 33 years, and I
never heard of such a thing in my life. I don't know how in the
world you get the authority to parade a lot of prostitutes in front
of a police car. That's like herding cattle. I feel now like I
ought to shore up my boundaries.''
   Barry's office declined comment, and no official of the
Washington Metropolitan Police accepted responsibility for the
bizarre roundup and 1{-mile march. It began, at about 1:30 a.m.
Tuesday, just seven blocks from the White House, and ended less
than an hour later on the 14th Street Bridge, the main artery
spanning the Potomac between Virginia and downtown Washington.
   The women were gathered from sidewalks near the intersection of
14th and L streets, the hub of the red-light district, and ordered
to hoof down the left lane of 14th to the Virginia border. A police
scout car, with red and blue lights flashing, led the assemblage,
while another brought up the rear.
   ``They said they were taking us to Virginia, that we could work
over there,'' said a woman who identified herself only as Toni.
``They said we'd go to jail if we stopped.'' None of the women was
arrested.
   ``It was like a perverted Memorial Day parade,'' said a
dumbfounded Treasury Department officer who witnessed the march
from his post at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
   The marchers had just started up the approach to the bridge when
a Washington Post reporter and photographer happened on the scene.
According to the Post, two officers grabbed the photographer when
he starting taking pictures and ordered him to stop. ``You're going
to ruin what we're trying to do,'' the officer was quoted as saying.
   When the photographer continued taking pictures, the newspaper
said, the four officers involved in the procession piled into their
cars, made U-turns, and drove against one-way traffic back into
town, leaving the weary women sitting on the sidewalk, rubbing
their sore feet.
   The officers had declined to identify themselves, and one, when
asked who was in charge, replied ``Nobody's in charge,'' the Post
said.
   Three police districts intersect at 14th and L, and spokesmen
for two of them denied any involvement. The commander of the other
one, Deputy Chief Edward J. Spurlock, promised an investigation and
said ``It's definitely not something I would approve. It sounds
awful bizarre to me. I assure you that's not the kind of thing we
encourage.''
   ``I hope the police department doesn't take this as a joke,''
said Arthur B. Spitzer, legal director of the local American Civil
Liberties Union. ``There's no law that allows police officers to
deport people.''
   Others weren't so critical. ``We'd be thrilled if they'd drive
them to Omaha, and we'd contribute for gas,'' said Barbara
Rothenberg, vice chairman of the neighborhood's citizens advisory
council.
   The shorter excursion apparently had little effect. When the
march ended, the women shared cabs back into town and most returned
to the same sidewalks whence they began.

   A village in southern Sudan where 8,000
people starved to death last summer could see a repeat of the
disaster because of insufficient food stocks for its surging
population, a relief official said Wednesday.
   The Western official said relief donors are studying
possibilities for sending more food to Abyei, the village 500 miles
southwest of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
   The official, who spoke in a telephone interview from Khartoum,
declined to be identified by name or organization because of the
sensitivity of the relief issue with the Sudanese government.
   The United Nations estimates that 250,000 people died as a
result of starvation and civil war in the southern Sudan during
1988. The world body says 100,000 more could die this year unless
its huge relief operation to send 105,000 tons of food into the
south succeeds.
   About 70,000 tons of supplies will have been moved by the end of
July, relief officials say.
   The Western official said Abyei received 3,000 tons of food,
enough to get 26,000 inhabitants and refugees through the June to
November rainy season. During that time, heavy rains isolate many
areas.
   However, the official said in the past few weeks up to 20,000
more refugees have arrived in Abyei, and ``the food is no longer
enough to last them through the rainy season.''
   The official also said many refugees were streaming in daily to
nearby Aweil, where 4,000 other people starved last year. However,
he had no details on food supplies there.
   Sudan's civil war started in 1983. Christians and animists are
fighting for more autonomy from the Arab Moslem majority government
in the north. The rebels claim to control up to 95 percent of the
southern countryside.
   The fighting has forced up to 2 million southerners to flee
their homes and livelihoods, making them dependent on relief food.
About 23 million people live in all of Sudan.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar expressed concern Wednesday about the possibility of
thousands of people being held in Angola by the South-West Africa
People's Organization.
   At a news conference on the last day of a summit by the
Organization of African Unity, Perez de Cuellar also said the U.N.
peacekeeping force is adequate to ensure free elections scheduled
in the former South African colony this fall.
   South Africa occupied the territory during World War I and began
to administer it in 1920 under a mandate from the League of
Nations. The league's successor, the United Nations, revoked the
mandate in 1966, called for an end to South African rule and
declared SWAPO the legitimate representative of the Namibian people.
   SWAPO still has bases in Angola, which borders on Namibia,
although its members are being repatriated to participate in the
pre-independence election campaign scheduled to lead to
parliamentary balloting in early November 1989.
   Perez de Cuellar said he discussed the matter of detainees with
SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma in Zambia last week.
   ``I think it is not only a concern of the South African
government, but the population would like to know the whereabouts
of 2,000 men,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Botswana's United Nations ambassador
and the secretary-general's special representative for Namibia,
noted that SWAPO released 201 detainees a few weeks ago and claims
those were all it held.
   He emphasized that there was no hard evidence to support claims
of thousands more in detention, ``but ... rumors are rife in
Namibia that there are still 2,000 to 2,500 detainees in Angola.''

<HEAD>Public Waiting Game Around Felix Bloch Masks Secret Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI appears to be engaged in an unusually
public waiting game with Felix S. Bloch, the diplomat suspected of
spying, illustrating the nature of espionage cases that regularly
produce long periods where agents ``sweat bullets.''
   For five days since the first news report on the case,
photographers and reporters have camped outside Bloch's Washington
apartment and his daughter's Chappaqua, N.Y., home. A caravan of
reporters and the FBI trailed Bloch and his daughter on a drive
into New York City on Tuesday.
   The State Department has publicly acknowledged that Bloch, a
senior U.S. diplomat, was put on paid leave and his diplomatic
passport was lifted June 22 while the FBI investigated ``illegal
activities'' involving ``agents of a foreign intelligence service''
_ shorthand for spying. Since then, he attended a private think
tank's European relations seminar in Washington where colleagues
assumed he was still at work in State's European bureau.
   The Justice Department has maintained its traditional stone wall
of silence about pending investigations and is reported to be upset
that State said so much.
   A few details of the government's evidence have leaked from
unidentified sources: There is said to be a videotape of Bloch
passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris and the same agent
is said to have been monitored later giving Bloch what appeared to
be a telephone warning that he was under suspicion.
   Given the government's knowledge, questions arise as to why
Bloch has not been arrested.
   ``Actually, it's not uncommon at all'' for considerable time to
pass between the first FBI interview with a spying suspect and an
eventual arrest, said James Nolan in an interview Wednesday.
Bloch's first FBI interview was said to have occurred June 22
though he was questioned earlier by State Department security
officers.
   Nolan, who retired in 1988 from his post as ambassador in charge
of State's Office of Foreign Missions, spent 20 years catching
spies for the FBI, rising to deputy chief of the bureau's
intelligence division.
   ``Between David Barnett's confession to us and his indictment,
it was over a month and he was walking around Washington free,''
Nolan said. ``Willam Bell of Hughes Aircraft was walking loose for
a couple of weeks between the time he confessed and his arrest.''
   ``In both cases, we had 24-hour surveillance and we were
sweating bullets'' for fear of an escape, Nolan said.
   Barnett, a former CIA agent, pleaded guilty in 1980 to selling
secrets to the Soviet KGB on three continents for $92,600. Bell, a
radar engineer for Hughes in southern California, pleaded guilty in
1981 to selling defense secrets to a Polish spy for $110,000.
   Government counterintelligence officials explain that covert
surveillance, such as telephone taps, is designed to catch spies in
errors, like a telephone warning. But they say deliberately visible
surveillance, like that on Bloch, is designed to discourage flight
while other agents try to assemble enough evidence for an arrest
warrant.
   Some observers have suggested the unusual publicity in Bloch's
case is designed to apply psychological pressure to produce a
confession. But Nolan said, ``It's a lot easier to make an arrest
outside the glare of publicity.''
   Why were Barnett, Bell and other spies not arrested the moment
they confessed? Because ultimately a suspect's attorney may well
try to have the confession thrown out so agents must prove it is
credible and will stand up in court.
   ``He's told you he's an agent and he's been paid,'' Nolan said.
``You have to go find a specific classified document he turned over
and someone in the government who will testify in court that it is
classified.''
   Nolan said U.S. espionage law requires proof that national
security information was given to a foreign power with intent to
harm the national defense.
   Sources say the government does not know what was in the
briefcase Bloch is said to have handed over. They say if the
material was classified it would be easy to prove intent to harm
because Bloch like all diplomats has been trained that the
classification system is designed to protect national security.
   In the case of confessions, Nolan added, ``You confirm every
part of the statement you can. You've got to look for the money. If
he says he met alone with the Soviets on such-and-such a night,
you'll never prove that. But if he says it was in Vienna and he
stayed at a particular hotel, you get the airline ticket and the
hotel receipt.''
   And when there's merely a suspicious contact with a foreign
agent but no confession? ``You've got an even longer case,'' said
Nolan, who emphasized that he had no information about the Bloch
case itself.
   ``Most spies get paid,'' Nolan said. ``If they don't confess,
you go through their bank accounts.''
   ``That takes an awful long time,'' he added.
   There's contradictory word from unidentified government sources
about whether Bloch has made any kind of confession.
   ABC News has reported that during his initial questioning by
U.S. authorities Bloch claimed at one point that he spied because
he fell into a Soviet sex trap, but the network said authorities
discounted that because the 54-year-old diplomat had not behaved
like a blackmail victim.
   Other government sources, also demanding anonymity, have played
down suggestions that he confessed to anything. They say that he
has a lawyer now and is refusing to cooperate with the FBI.
   Nevertheless, Austrian officials in Vienna, where Bloch served
as the No. 2 officer in the U.S. Embassy for five years, said
Tuesday they want to question a Viennese prostitute they say had a
relationship with Bloch.
   It could not be learned whether this was an effort to check some
statement he made or merely a hunt for anything useful to the
investigation.

   An alarming number of peregrine falcon
eggs failed to hatch this year in southern Oregon and northern
California, say scientists who fear chemical contamination is to
blame.
   Falcon eggs taken from the same area last year after they failed
to hatch found deadly chemicals, including dioxin, said Joel
``Jeep'' Pagel, a U.S. Forest Service falcon specialist.
   Tests on eggs laid this year are incomplete, but Pagel said
Tuesday that he fears the chemicals are killing the embryos before
they mature enough to hatch.
   ``At the beginning of the year, I had 28 aeries (falcon nests) I
monitored,'' Pagel said from his office in Happy Camp, Calif. ``I
had 22 of those 28 aeries fail this year, which is astronomical.
It's a little above 78 percent.''
   Pagel normally finds and bands 25 or 30 young falcons a nesting
season. This year he found only 11. This year's jump in nesting
mortality was the biggest Pagel has seen since he began watching
the birds in 1983.
   Damage to falcon eggs by the now-banned pesticide DDT reduced
the population to just two pairs in California and none in Oregon
by 1975. But since then, the population has recovered to the point
California has 85 pairs and Oregon has 13 pairs.
   Dioxin, a deadly chemical found in the Vietnam-era herbicide
Agent Orange and used in industry, has been found in peregrine
falcon eggs from the central coast of California the past couple of
years. But Pagel thought northern California and southern Oregon
birds were isolated enough to escape contamination.
   ``So much for our little haven,'' he said.
   Pagel turned over seven of the eggs that failed to hatch this
year to Wally Jarman, a graduate student at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, for testing. Results are due in September.
   Last year, Jarman's tests on failed eggs found dioxin and
related chemicals, as well as a compound related to cancer-causing
PCBs. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, come from a fire
retardant that used to be added to the oil in electrical
transformers.
   Jarman has found the same chemicals in failed peregrine falcon
eggs laid between 1983 and 1988 in nests in the Big Sur area on
California's central coast.
   In the Big Sur eggs, he also found DDE, which is formed in the
tissues of animals exposed to DDT. DDT hasn't been used in this
country since 1972, but it is extremely slow to break down in the
environment, and it lingers in the animals who consume it.
   ``The big question was why such a pristine area would have high
levels of pesticides, PCBs and dioxins,'' Jarman said.
   Jarman said the poisons don't seem to be coming from any one
source. Since the falcons are predators, they accumulate chemicals
consumed by their varied prey, which ranges from small birds like
the titmouse to larger ones like ducks and gulls.
   Brian Walton, coordinator of the Predatory Bird Research Group
at the University of California, Santa Cruz, theorized that the
aging of the birds Pagel has been watching may account for their
newfound nesting failure.
   ``It may be that after they are five or six years old they build
up sufficient levels (of toxic chemicals) that they start
failing,'' Walton said. ``They can breed while they're young, but
when they get old, they fail.

   The four Democratic candidates for mayor accused
one another of incompetence and even outright lawbreaking Monday
during their first debate.
   Among the sharpest barbs at the 1{-hour affair:
   _Mayor Edward I. Koch flatly accused Manhattan Borough President
David Dinkins of tax evasion. Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin
suggested Dinkins was unfit to be mayor because of his four-year
tax lapse in the early 1970s.
   _Dinkins and Goldin scored corruption in city agencies,
describing Koch's administration as among the most corrupt New York
has known.
   _Koch described Goldin as ``the most-investigated comptroller in
the city's history,'' and declared: ``There have been no criminal
charges filed against him _ so far.''
   _Former transit chief Richard Ravitch, once a Koch adviser,
portrayed the mayor as an egotistical bully who made his aides sit
through videos about himself. ``We weren't asked for new ideas and
new visions,'' Ravitch said. ``We were asked how he was doing.''
   That remark prompted laughter, but onlookers in the
standing-room crowd of 500 more often drew their breaths at the
sharpness of the onslaughts. The four men are vying to face a
Republican nominee who is expected to be Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
popular former federal prosecutor.
   The debate in a midtown Manhattan auditorium was sponsored by
the New York Post.
   Much of the criticism was leveled at Koch, whose third term has
been scarred by corruption scandals. Dinkins charged him with
heading ``perhaps the most corrupt administration since Jimmy
Walker,'' the flamboyant, crooked mayor from 1925-32.
   Goldin was even harsher, slowly pronouncing the names of seven
Koch commissioners who lost their jobs over charges of wrongdoing.
   ``They haul 'em off in manacles. They throw 'em in jail. You've
had to dismiss them in disgrace. That's a record that you can't
laugh away. ... It is a record of the worst corruption in a
municipal administration in this city's history. And it's your
fault.''
   Koch defended his stewardship of the city and counterattacked
with gusto. He said investigations of Goldin's office had found
``incompetence, the appearance of impropriety and grave concern
about his personal integrity.''
   The mayor, who seeks a fourth four-year term, was equally direct
with Dinkins, the leader in most polls. On Dinkins' failure to file
tax returns for four years, Koch said: ``I believe that he
committed tax evasion.''
   Dinkins sought to defuse the issue, noting that he paid his back
taxes with penalties and was not charged criminally. ``No one has
ever accused me of tax evasion. Tax evasion is not something of
which I am guilty,'' he said.
   Ravitch took the least confrontational tone, saying Dinkins was
``an honorable man,'' Goldin was ``a good controller,'' and Koch
was ``personally honest'' and an effective mayor in his earlier
years.
   But Ravitch _ who never has held elective office _ painted his
three opponents as the agents of a failed city government.
   ``The public doesn't want to see the tires on the car rotated.
They want the engine changed,'' Ravitch said. He added later: ``If
you want more of the same, elect one of these three. But if you
want change, elect me.''
   Among his proposals, he said he would add 6,000 police officers
to street patrols, paying the $360 million bill by eliminating
10,000 workers in other city agencies in which the mayor controls
hiring.
   Goldin stressed his plan to criminalize drug use, in addition to
the crimes of drug possession and sale. He also urged mandatory
drug treatment at boot-camp style jails for criminals found to have
used drugs.
   Dinkins said he would improve a variety of programs including
education, health care and drug treatment. He proposed seeking
individual and corporate donations to fund drug-education programs
in the schools.
   Koch maintained that his record _ including efforts, he said, to
root out corruption at city agencies _ established him as best
qualified. ``If you're a candidate, you talk,'' he said. ``If
you're the mayor, you do.''

<HEAD>Too Much American TV on European Sets? Congress Hears Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British media executive Robert Maxwell urged
Congress on Wednesday not to go to ``war'' with the European
Community over a proposal to limit how much U.S. programming may be
shown on European TV.
   Maxwell appeared before a House subcommittee that is considering
a possible U.S. response if the European Community limits American
programming to about 50 percent of what is shown on European TV. He
said Europe is determined to limit U.S. imports one way or the
other.
   But Hollywood representatives at Wednesday's hearing of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and
finance said they could not live with a quota system that threatens
to erode the $2.5 billion balance of trade surplus the U.S. film
and television industry has overseas.
   The European Community proposal is part of a plan to lower trade
barriers between the 12 European nations in 1992. The ``Television
Without Frontiers'' proposal calls for a ``majority proportion'' of
transmission time, ``where practical,'' to be reserved for works of
European origin with the 12 member nations.
   It would replace a patchwork of existing restrictions that range
from tough, mandatory quotas in France to none at all in Denmark
and Greece.
   Maxwell, who has extensive publishing and cable TV holdings in
Britain, France and elsewhere, told the subcommittee that rather
than making ``saber-rattling'' threats of trade retaliation, the
Bush administration and Hollywood producers should try to negotiate
a more favorable quota system with the 12-nation European Community.
   Otherwise, Hollywood will face even harsher restrictions if the
European countries are left to impose quotas individually, he said.
   He said the European proposal, because it wasn't mandatory, was
a compromise ``soft quota'' system that was considerably less
stringent than that being sought by France, Belgium and the
Netherlands. Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain will not accept
mandatory quotas, he said.
   He said he was here to open a ``dialogue'' with Hollywood
executives to try to reach an accord, but ``but that dialogue
cannot be no quotas.''
   He urged the subcommittee not to ``blindly support this (U.S.
film-TV) industry if it leads to war with Europe.''
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he welcomed negotiations, but if talks fail, the
Hollywood community will ask Congress to ``help protect a national
asset.''
   ``When quotas come in the front door, consumer choice goes out
the back,'' Valenti said.
   American shows such as ``Dallas'' are very popular overseas, and
they are relatively inexpensive to buy. But Maxwell said just 5,000
hours out of 105,000 hours of movies and tapes shown on European TV
are produced in Europe, with the rest mainly coming from the United
States.
   That makes it an issue of money and jobs _ and preserving
Europe's ``cultural diversity,'' Maxwell said. ``European citizens
will not sit in their parlors watching their culture replaced by
images made in Hollywood, Mexico City or Tokyo.''
   But subcommittee Chairman Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., told
Maxwell there was strong bipartisan feeling in Congress that the
United States would do what it had to keep markets open overseas.
   He said the proposed quoto was ``strongly opposed by the
adminstration, which has criticized it as violative of
international trade agreements and aimed at reducing a $2.5 billion
trade surplus in one of the very few remaining sectors where the
United States enjoys a trade surplus.''

<TEXT>
   A herd of Chinese hogs has been officially
admitted into the United States for breeding experiments, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The 140 hogs were released after four months of quarantine and
testing at the department's animal import center on Fleming Key
near Key West, Fla., said James W. Glosser, administrator of the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   The Chinese animals were described as ``unusually prolific'' and
that their twice-yearly litters average 16 to 20 newborn, with a
record of 33. That compares to an average of 10 to 12 young for
most U.S. breeds, he said.
   Three breeds with exotic names are involved: Meishan, Ming and
Feng-Jing. The animals were obtained through a contract between the
department's Agricultural Research Service and the Chinese National
Animal Breeding Stock Import and Export Corp.
   Under the agreement, the USDA research agency, the University of
Illinois, and Iowa State University are equally sharing costs of
the imported hogs and will share the animals for study.
   Glosser said the hogs will next reside at USDA's meat animal
research center, Clay Center, Neb.; the University of Illinois,
Urbana; and Iowa State University, Ames.

<HEAD>Lucas Wins Undecided Senator Specter In Confirmation Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Lucas won over a key undecided
lawmaker Tuesday in his drive to become the nation's chief civil
rights enforcer, putting him a step closer to gaining the blessing
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   ``It's more important to have someone who understands Supreme
Court decisions from personal experience, knows it so to speak in
his gut, as opposed to someone who knows where to put all the
commas and semicolons,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in
endorsing Lucas.
   His endorsement of the embattled nominee came the day before a
scheduled committee vote on whether to recommend the nomination.
Specter said support and opposition for Lucas were nearly equal
``at this precise moment.''
   Civil rights groups contend Lucas, 61, a former Wayne County,
Mich., sheriff and county executive who is black, lacks the
experience to serve as assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   The nomination is on the Judiciary Committee agenda for
Thursday, although any member of the panel could force a
postponement and Specter said a quick vote following last week's
hearings would be unusual.
   Specter had been considered the one committee Republican who
might oppose Lucas. His decision put the spotlight on Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., as a possible swing vote with power to send the
nomination to the Senate floor with the panel's blessing.
   Eight votes are needed for a favorable recommendation. It
appeared that Lucas could rely on all six of the committee's
Republicans plus Sen. Dennis DeConcini, although the Arizona
Democrat has never quite finalized his support.
   A number of lawmakers remained undeclared, but the nominee
appeared likely to face opposition from six other Democrats on the
committee with Heflin a lingering question mark.
   Even if Heflin voted against Lucas, the nomination could still
go to the floor without a recommendation or even with an
unfavorable one, although that could make it even harder for Lucas
to win confirmation in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
   President Bush, in an interview with Knight-Ridder on Tuesday
that was released Wednesday, dismissed most of the arguments
against Lucas as motivated by ``pure politics.''
   ``I am convinced that a lot of the opposition... came because he
made the mistake of changing to the Republican Party,'' Bush said,
referring to Lucas' switch before a 1986 run for Michigan governor.
``I strongly support him.''
   The position Lucas is seeking entails supervising 151 attorneys
and a much larger support staff that is charged with enforcing the
nation's civil rights laws through the courts. He would succeed
William Bradford Reynolds, who was at odds with civil rights groups
throughout much of the Reagan administration.
   The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, whose past
presidents include attorneys general, law school deans and leading
lawyers, recommended Wednesday that the Judiciary Committee reject
the Lucas nomination.
   ``On the basis of Mr. Lucas' lack of substantive legal
experience and his lack of understanding of both basic civil rights
law and civil rights decisions of the United States Supreme Court,
we cannot support Mr. Lucas,'' the group said in a letter to
committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Right, said his group was disappointed by Specter's decision
``but we remain confident that the Senate will not confirm Mr.
Lucas.''
   David Runkel, an assistant to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
said he was ``confident and even more confident with Senator
Specter's announced support'' that Lucas will win a favorable
recommendation. ``We're hopeful there will be a vote tomorrow.''
   Following the appearance of Lucas before the Judiciary Committee
last week both Biden and Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said they were
disturbed by the nominee's answers to questions about civil rights
issues.
   He repeatedly sidestepped invitations from the lawmakers to be
critical of recent Supreme Court decisions that are under fire from
civil rights groups.
   Specter scoffed at this criticism, however, telling reporters
that Lucas was politically bound to agree with the positions
already expressed by Bush and Thornburgh.
   ``Had he deviated from what either of his bosses had said, he
could have been in a lot of hot water,'' Specter said. He said
Lucas' experiences as he rose from dishwasher to major public
official would help him do the civil rights job.

<HEAD>FDA Allows Wider Use of Experimental Drug for Premature Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday
authorized wider use of an experimental drug to treat and prevent a
respiratory disorder that is the leading cause of death and
disability among premature infants.
   Respiratory Distress Syndrome, also called hyaline membrane
disorder, afflicts as many as 50,000 of the 250,000 infants born
prematurely each year in the United States.
   About 5,000 of them die from the condition, which occurs when
immature lungs are not yet producing an inside coating that keeps
them from collapsing when the infant exhales, the FDA said. A son
born to then-President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy in 1963 died of the
disorder, the agency said.
   The drug, a synthetic surfactant, is licensed by Burroughs
Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   It will be made available under an FDA category used for drugs
shown to be safe and effective for a serious or life-threatening
disease but not yet approved for commercial marketing.
   The FDA said the drug can be administered as a single dose
immediately after birth to help prevent death in high-risk
premature infants of 1.5 to 2.5 pounds, or as two doses to treat
infants of more than 1.5 pounds who have the syndrome.
   The drug has been associated with an increase in episodes of
apnea, a temporary cessation of breathing that is not fatal and is
correctable, the FDA said.
   The agency said Burroughs Wellcome will make the drug available
at no cost to U.S. hospitals and other health-care facilities that
can provide state-of-the-art care to high-risk mothers and infants.

   Christian and Syrian gunners unleashed
barrages of artillery and rockets on Beirut's residential districts
Wednesday, killing five people and shattering a two-day lull in
their 19-week-old confrontation.
   Police said 20 people were also wounded in the attacks, which
began shortly after nightfall.
   The thuds of exploding shells shook the city, and orange flashes
of exploding rockets illuminated the skies over Beirut, which was
in total darkness because of fuel oil shortages at power plants.
   Ambulances, their sirens wailing, raced through the city streets
and radio stations blared appeals to residents of the divided
capital to hurry to basements and bomb shelters.
   The radio stations later reported several fires burning out of
control in Beirut.
   Long-range artillery guns in the Christian heartland blasted
east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, targetting the Syrian army's supply
routes from Damascus. They also hit west Beirut and hills to the
southeast with 155mm howitzers and 130mm mortars.
   The Syrians blasted east Beirut and dozens of villages and towns
to the north and northeast, using mortar guns and Soviet-designed
BM-21 multi-barreled rocket launchers which spit out 40 projectiles
per minute.
   The sudden nighttime escalation capped day-long skirmishes with
automatic rifles across Beirut's dividing Green Line in which nine
other people were wounded. It shattered hopes of a temporary truce
until a political settlement could be worked out.
   The new casualties raised the toll to 458 killed and 1,889
wounded since the current round of fighting in the 14-year civil
war broke out March 8.
   Earlier Wednesday, five cargo ships carrying food supplies
docked at ports in the besieged Christian enclave north of the
capital, and reports said an undeclared truce was in force.
   A police spokesman said Syrian batteries fired only six
howitzers at daybreak as two vessels sailed slowly into Beirut Port
and three into Jounieh, 12 miles to the north.
   Previously, hundreds of shells and rockets would rain on the
coast when a vessel was seen. Syrian gunners have hit at least six
ships since March.
   The police spokesman said Lebanese army Gen. Michel Aoun's
gunners retaliated with four artillery rounds at Syrian batteries
on west Beirut beaches. He refused to disclose the ships' names,
flags or owners.
   They carried ``canned food supplies, including meat and
vegetables,'' the spokesman said.
   He said it was ``very unusual of the Syrians not to fire
heavily'' at the ships.
   Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian soldiers and a 6,000-strong
coalition of right-wing Christian militias control a 28-mile
stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean coast.
   Syrian and allied Moslem forces have trapped 1 million
Christians in the enclave for four months. They enforced the siege
in retaliation for a blockade Aoun ordered on illegal ports run by
Moslem militias.
   The prestigious daily newspaper An-Nahar earlier reported an
``undeclared truce.'' It said an Arab League peace committee
mediated the cease-fire after ``discreet contacts'' with Aoun and
the Syrian leadership.
   The ``combatants agreed to give the tripartite committee another
chance to bring about a peaceful end to the conflict,'' An-Nahar
said, but added: ``It is not known how long the cease-fire would
last'' without an official declaration.
   The committee, comprising Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid,
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and King Hassan II of Morocco, has been
criticized severely for failing to make progress a month after it
was formed.
   Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily, in a front-page report said the
committee has decided to ``freeze its activities for a short period
of time'' while it considers Syria's refusal to negotiate with Aoun.
   ``The key hurdle blocking the work of the three-member
committee... is the recognition of Aoun as a negotiating partner,''
the newspaper said.
   It quoted Syrian President Hafez Assad as saying: ``If our
Lebanese allies accept Aoun as a negotiator on behalf of the other
party, we will not accept him. This is a final and irreversible
decision.''
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive Syria's
40,000 troops out of Lebanon for violating their Arab League
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems.

   The last Buick, shimmering in a fresh
coat of white paint, rolled out of the 41-year-old General Motors
Corp. plant here Wednesday, marking the end of the line for 1,300
workers.
   Some workers are turning down a company buyout, holding out hope
that the plant might open again some day. But most were resigned to
the idea there would be no reprieve for the plant.
   ``We've done a lot of deep thinking about what we're going to do
with our lives,'' said supervisor Robert Biscotti. ``There has been
a grieving period, but after a while you realize: `What can you
do?'''
   GM is closing the plant because demand for the Buick Century and
Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera it produces isn't keeping up with the
company's capacity to build them.
   Dee Allen, a Detroit-based spokesman for the automaker, said
there is little chance the plant would be reopened.
   ``We haven't precluded the option of opening again, but we have
more than enough facilities without Framingham,'' he said.
   The plant has had two other layoffs, including about 1,200 this
spring, and some temporary closings during the last several years.
About 500 workers are staying on temporarily to help put the plant
in mothballs.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who worked to keep the plant
open, concedes there is little that can be done if people aren't
buying cars.
   The plant's manager, J. Russell McCarthy, drove the last car off
the line and into the loading yard.
   ``We've had good years where we've worked six days a week and
then days where we don't work at all,'' said Roland Cole, a 20-year
plant veteran and United Auto Workers member.
   ``It's been a home to a lot of us. We've been like brothers,''
says Joao DeCruz, a native of Portugal who plans to go on
unemployment.
   Dominic Miele, a 28-year plant veteran, was less philosophical:
``We've got a president who wants to give Poland $100 million when
we can't take care of our own at home.''
   Many of the senior employees have opted for early retirement.
Some have taken advantage of GM, state and federally funded
retraining programs or relocation.
   Others have accepted a company buyout that union officials say
they can't discourage because the prospects for getting rehired are
nil. GM offered one-time payments of $40,000 to workers with 10 or
more years service and $65,000 to those with 25 years on the job.
   Dukakis recalled Wednesday how he met with GM President Roger
Smith and other top company officials about sparing the plant after
the company announced the closing plans in February.
   ``All I can tell you is what he (Smith) said to me, and that was
that they didn't invest a quarter of a billion dollars to modernize
the plant so (GM could) walk away from it,'' Dukakis said.
   The company plans to bring down costs by building A-cars like
the Cutlass Ciera and Century only at its plants in Oklahoma City;
St. Therese, Quebec, and Ramos Aripze, Mexico.
   The plant, Framingham's largest employer, last year paid
$830,000 in local taxes, spent $19 million on local suppliers and
had a payroll of $59 million.
   The city of 65,000 is likely to suffer the blow better than many
factory towns because of its diverse economic base, which includes
computer manufacturing, stationery production and a 375-room hotel.

   Congress was told Wednesday that Internal
Revenue Service inspectors in charge of keeping employees honest
should be separated from the rest of the agency so they aren't
compromised by personal relationships.
   ``While nominally independent today, inspection is dependent on
other IRS functions to operate on a daily basis,'' said Frank
Rippetoe, former inspector in Los Angeles.
   ``This sometimes leads to attempts by IRS managers to influence
internal security activities,'' he told the House Government
Operations subcommittee on on commerce, consumer and monetary
affairs.
   IRS officials were to testify Thursday at the hearings into
accusations involving the agency. But in testimony released in
advance, Commissioner Fred Goldberg said steps are being taken to
minimize employee misconduct.
   IRS officials have said they would not comment on specific cases
because of privacy laws concerning tax returns.
   Initial witnesses on the second day of hearings were formerly
employed at the tax agency's Los Angeles office, where the
subcommittee's probe began.
   They told of an internal investigation of the former head of the
Criminal Investigative Division in Los Angeles which they believed
was compromised by personal relationships.
   ``The chief of CID was Ron Saranow and he did not encourage
cooperation by his agents unless it was to resolve a problem for
him,'' said Rippetoe. ``Mr. Saranow and several of his managers
cultivated a friendship with one of the inspection managers in
L.A., Debbie Jones, and led his agents to believe that she could be
approached to assist them if they had a problem with inspection.''
   Witnesses said that in the Los Angeles office Saranow had
considerable control over what was said about him.
   Former inspector Russ Davis said Saranow and Jones were commonly
believed to have a ``close, personal relationship.''
   As a result, when Saranow became the subject of an internal
probe, agents were reluctant to talk because they felt everything
they said would get back to Saranow, said Davis.
   The office in general was divided into the ``front office
favorites'' and the ``lunatic fringe,'' said Chuck McCalmont,
former group manager for the CID in Los Angeles.
   ``Agents were reluctant to report employee conduct violations to
the inspection service if it involved a manager or one of the front
office favorites,'' said McCalmont. ``The agents also felt if the
allegation involved a so-called lunatic fringe agent, inspection,
with the backing of our front office, went all out to prove the
allegation.''
   Though Saranow, who retired from the IRS without being charged
with misconduct, was interviewed by subcommittee investigators, he
was not scheduled to testify at the hearings which continue
Thursday.
   The investigators said Tuesday that Saranow would have exercised
his rights under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination if
he were called to the hearings.
   Ms. Jones remains in her position with internal security at the
Los Angeles office. She was not scheduled to testify. When The
Associated Press attempted to reach her by telephone at her office,
a public affairs spokeswoman for the IRS said she would call back
later.
   Also testifying Wednesday were three IRS auditors who said they
reported suspected misconduct by an inspection manager in Chicago
and found it detrimental to their careers.
   ``We were threatened, harassed and retaliated against by top
inspection executives,'' said George Ecola.
   The witnesses said the manager they blew the whistle on was
eventually suspended for 12 days for accepting illegal gratuities,
though his friends in the agency took up a collection to make up
for his lost salary. He has since resigned from the IRS.
   They said the complaint, however, caused one whistle-blower to
be removed from management, another demoted and the third
threatened with a downgrade.

   A former Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. president
whose conviction for intentionally distributing phony apple juice
for babies was dismissed will be tried again in federal court, a
judge said Wednesday.
   The executive, 55-year-old Niels L. Hoyvald, was convicted in
February 1988 in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on some 350 counts
of willfully violating the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   He was accused of marketing as pure apple juice what was really
sugar water containing little, if any, apple.
   In March, a three-judge panel in the 2nd U.S. Circuit of Appeals
threw out the conviction, ruling that technically those violations
were tried in the wrong jurisdiction.
   The judges, in a 2-1 decision, said the prosecution failed to
prove the case should have been heard in the district where the
trial was held.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Platt ruled that a
retrial on the charges that were overturned would open Aug. 21.
   During the original trial, the jury was unable to reach a
verdict on a conspiracy charge and 18 counts of mail fraud against
Hoyvald, and prosecutors said they would retry him on those charges
in Brooklyn.
   ``The government is determined to see this case through to the
finish,'' said Thomas H. Roche, the lead government prosecutor.
``The conduct that he engaged in is not something you just wink at
and say good-bye.''
   A second Beech-Nut official, John F. Lavery, 57, a former vice
president for manufacturing at the Beech-Nut plant in Canajoharie,
N.Y., was convicted with Hoyvald of knowingly marketing the phony
juice.
   The appeals court also reversed some 400 counts against Lavery,
but allowed conspiracy and mail-fraud convictions to stand. Lavery
said he would take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both men,
sentenced to a year and a day in jail, are free pending appeal.
   Beech-Nut pleaded guilty in 1987 to 215 counts of shipping
mislabeled products and paid a $2 million fine.
   The Fort Washington, Pa., company is the nation's second-largest
baby-food maker after the Gerber Products Co.
   Leonard Borrino, a Beech-Nut spokesman, said Nestle stopped
paying Hoyvald's legal expenses in October and fired him in
December.
   In a similar case, three men were charged Tuesday in Chicago
with conspiracy for selling millions of cases of orange juice that
allegedly were diluted with beet sugar, waste water and other
products. The federal charges accuse two former owners and a top
executive of the now-defunct Bodines Inc. of mislabeling juice sold
from 1978 to 1985.

<HEAD>Former von Bulow Butler Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Louis Biastre, the former butler to
Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow who testified in the attempted murder
trial of Claus von Bulow, died of an apparent heart attack. He was
63.
   Frances Ann Biastre, a sister-in-law, said Tuesday she
discovered Biastre, who was taking heart medication, on the floor
near the kitchen sink, holding nitroglycerin pills in his hand.
   He was pronounced dead at the scene by Fire Department rescue
workers.
   Biastre retired in November after Clarendon Court, the von
Bulows' 8.3-acre estate in Newport, was sold to Glen and Patricia
Randall of Washington for $4.2 million.
   Biastre testified during von Bulow's first trial in 1982 that
Mrs. von Bulow was not a heavy drinker, discrediting the defense's
claim that she induced her own coma by drinking and taking drugs.
But he also said Claus von Bulow ordered all sweets from the house
because of his wife's hypoglycemia, or low sugar count.
   Mrs. von Bulow, 57, has been in a coma at Columbia Presbyterian
Hospital in New York for nine years. Claus von Bulow was convicted
of attempted murder in his first trial, but that conviction was
overturned and he was acquitted at the retrial.
   A lifelong resident of Newport, Biastre worked for the von
Bulows from 1973 to 1988.
   Claus von Bulow, 62, agreed in 1987 to divorce his wife and
relinquish all claims to her money in an out-of-court settlement of
a lawsuit filed by two of Mrs. von Bulow's three children.
   Biastre is survived by a brother, Albert A. Biastre, and several
nieces and nephews.

<HEAD>Bus Shooting Suspect Arrested in Nebraska</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drifter accused of killing two people
on a municipal bus was arrested Wednesday in Nebraska as he lunged
for the suspected murder weapon in a car stolen from the shooting
scene, police said.
   In Nebraska, Keith County Judge Lloyd Kaufman set bond for
Joseph Alexander Besaraba, 44, at $1 million in a hearing by
telephone. Arraignment was expected Thursday in Ogallala.
   He was being held on a Florida arrest warrant in Sunday's bus
shooting, as well as suspicion of attempted assault on a peace
officer and possession of a stolen vehicle in Nebraska, both
felonies, said Keith County Attorney Deborah Gilg.
   Besaraba was found sleeping in the back seat of a car beside
Interstate 80 near Brule, Neb., said Hollywood police spokesman
David Steele.
   Keith County sheriff's officers investigated the parked car
because the vehicle lacked a front license plate, Steele said. Such
plates are required on Nebraska vehicles, although front plates
aren't issued in Florida.
   Besaraba was asked to get out of the car while officers ran a
license check, and they learned the vehicle had been stolen in
Florida.
   As officers took him into custody, Besaraba dove into the car to
reach for a 9mm German Luger, ``which has been described as the
murder weapon through witnesses at the crime scene,'' said
Hollywood police Sgt. Darron Castiglione.
   Officers subdued the man, found identification in the car and
took him to the Keith County Jail, Steele said.
   Besaraba was wearing the same plaid shirt and blue jeans
described by shooting witnesses and carried $500 in traveler's
checks purchased in Miami six days before the shooting, Castiglione
said.
   Two Hollywood detectives left for Nebraska to interview
Besaraba, a naturalized American citizen who came to the United
States from Ballendorf, West Germany, in 1970.
   He was accused of boarding a municipal bus in Hollywood and
fatally shooting driver Sydney Granger and passenger Wesley B.
Anderson with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.
   Besaraba then allegedly commandeered a getaway car, critically
wounding driver Scott Yaguda, 31, a bakery manager from Alexandria,
Va., with gunshots to his back and legs. Yaguda was in stable
condition at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, said spokeswoman
Cynthia Wine.
   The Florida warrant charges Besaraba with two counts of
first-degree murder, one of attempted first-degree murder and armed
robbery.
   He was described in Florida as a drifter who stuffed his pockets
with cash earned by participating in medical research projects. He
also frequented libraries _ his photograph was recognized by
library workers in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood.

<HEAD>Encainide and Flecainide Heart Drugs Important for Some, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two heart drugs that were dropped from a
federal study earlier this year are still important in the
treatment of patients with life-threatening irregular heartbeats, a
Food and Drug Administration expert said Wednesday.
   Dr. Robert Temple, director of one of two FDA offices of drug
evaluation, said that although the drugs encainide and flecainide
are no longer recommended for use with patients with mild heartbeat
problems, the drugs give doctors another way to possibly control
very serious cardiac irregularities.
   ``The drugs are useful for those people who are in a fairly
desperate situation,'' he said in an interview. ``There are a lot
of drugs (to treat heart disease) and none of them work all the
time. You need a full complement of drugs in that situation.''
   Encainide is marketed by Bristol-Myers under the brand name
Enkaid, and flecainide is sold by 3M Riker under the name Tambocor.
   The two drugs were used in a National Institutes of
Health-directed study called the cardiac arrhythmia suppression
trials, or CAST.
   In this study, encainide and flecainide were given to patients
who had suffered heart attacks and then experienced mild or
asymptomatic extra heartbeats.
   The drugs were dropped from the trials last April after the NIH
found that more of the CAST patients taking the medication were
dying suddenly than were patients in the study who were taking only
sugar pills.
   A board monitoring CAST found that among 730 patients receiving
encainide or flecainide there were 57 cardiac arrests, while among
725 patients in the study taking only placebos, 22 died of cardiac
arrest.
   ``The study was designed to see if reducing those extra beats
that are known to be associated with excess risk would improve
survival,'' said Temple. ``Obviously it didn't.''
   CAST continues, however, using a third drug, moricizine, which
was not associated with increased numbers of premature deaths. This
drug is not now on the market.
   Temple said the medical logic of CAST _ combatting the disease
by controlling the symptoms _ has been applied successfully in many
medical studies. For instance, he said, it been shown that
controlling high blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart attack.
   The FDA doctor said encainide and flecainide remain in wide use
because ``they work well with some patients.'' He said no patient
taking the drugs should change medication without physician
approval.
   A Philadelphia physician, Dr. Joel Morganroth of Graduate
Hospital, said that a survey he took of cardiologists before CAST
was modified showed that about half of the 250 doctors who
responded were prescribing the drugs to control heartbeat
irregularities in patients like those in the NIH study.
   He said in an interview that, based on data from this survey and
from other statistical studies, there may have been up to 3,000
persons who died prematurely while taking these drugs.
   For a brief period on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported
erroneously that these deaths were connected to the CAST studies.
Morganroth said he surveyed only doctors who were not in the drug
trials. He said, also, that his estimate of the number who may have
died while taking these drugs was only a rough number based on
statistical assumptions.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Wednesday
promised to revive an improved version of a retirement center
program he suspended, saying the needs of the poor and elderly
would not be slighted as he cleans house at his department.
   Kemp, whose Department of Housing and Urban Development has been
tainted by allegations of fraud and influence-peddling under his
predecessor, said he is engaged in a ``Herculean task of cleaning
out the Augean stables.''
   ``We are going to both clean up HUD and make it work while
moving forward on goals that Congress and President Bush have laid
out,'' Kemp told the House Select Committee on Aging.
   In a light-hearted reference to the problems dogging HUD, Kemp
said it was appropriate that he appear before the aging committee
because ``there is no secretary in the Cabinet who is aging
faster.''
   Kemp, who has suspended, restricted or revised several federal
housing programs because of alleged abuse and mismanagement,
promised the Retirement Service Center program would be ``reopened,
retargeted, tightened up.''
   The program was designed to provide housing to elderly people
who can live on their own and pay market rates for special services
such as central dining and recreation. However, because the centers
often were too expensive, buildings were slow to fill and defaults
mounted.
   ``We are currently evaluating this program to determine if it
can be redesigned so that it produces housing for those who need
it, rather than producing empty buildings and losses as experienced
in the past,'' Kemp told the committee.
   Kemp also said he was shocked that because of policies of the
previous HUD administration, 30,000 or more proposed rental housing
units for the elderly and handicapped ``never left the drawing
board'' even though federal financing had been approved.
   ``I have ordered a speedy review of the policies that caused the
delays and after review with my appointees, we will take immediate
actions to get this clog out of our pipeline,'' he said.
   Kemp, who spoke at a hearing on the housing needs of the frail
elderly, voiced support for proposals to help people stay out of
nursing homes by linking government housing aid with programs that
offer home-care services.
   ``Without extra help, some elderly folks facing needs with daily
living could be forced to leave their homes and become prematurely
institutionalized in our hospitals and nursing homes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Asian-Americans Ask Bush for Help</HEAD>

   Asian-American leaders appealed to President
Bush for help Wednesday for a variety of causes, from speeding
reparations for Japanese-Americans interned in World War II to
guarding against discrimination in admission to elite universities.
   They also lauded Bush's measured response to the Chinese
government's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Many of the 17 Asian-Americans who met privately with Bush were
Republican party activists, including Anna Chenault, head of the
National Republican Asian Assembly, and Cindy Shinga Daub, who was
national director of Asian-Americans for Bush-Quayle.
   Bush said he intends to nominate Ms. Daub as the new chairman of
the Copyright Royalty Tribunal effective Sept. 27. He also told the
group that John B. Tsu will head the secretary of education's
regional office in San Francisco.
   Cressey Nakagawa, national president of the Japanese American
Citizens' League, appealed for Bush's help to speed reparation
payments to the World War II internees.
   Former President Ronald Reagan signed legislation last Aug. 10
authorizing payments of $20,000 each to the 60,000 survivors of the
120,000 Japanse-Americans interned during the war. But Congress and
the administration have been slow to come up with the funds to
actually make the payments.
   Tsu, who teaches at John F. Kennedy University in Orienda,
Calif., said he raised the issue of discrimination in admissions,
and ``the president was very much concerned.''
   Bush noted how many high school valedictorians are
Asian-Americans, and said admissions ``should be equal and fair,''
according to Tsu.
   Asian-Americans have charged some elite universities limit
admissions of their children and hold them to higher entry
standards than other students.
   Tsu said the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of
Education is currently conducting compliance surveys at the
University of California, Los Angeles, and Harvard University.
   On the China situation, Mrs. Chennault said, ``I have suggested
to our president we should be firm and yet be positive'' toward the
government in Beijing.
   ``I think the president, looking in the long term, is taking a
very reasonable, realistic position,'' said Mrs. Chennault, who
said ``top leaders'' in China have invited her to visit.
   Frank Yining Liu, president of the Organization of Chinese
Americans and law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,
said they also urged Bush to ``preserve the principle of family
unification'' in U.S. immigration policies.
   John K. Lim, president of the Federation of Korean American
Associations of America, said Bush had a chance to ``open the door
to North Korea,'' as former President Nixon did with China.
   Heng Cheng, a former president of Cambodia now living in
Houston, said he asked for Bush's support to get a chance to
participate in talks in Paris on settling the strife in Cambodia.
   Krishna Srinivasa, co-chairman of Indian-Americans for
Bush-Quayle '88, said, ``We are very delighted. ... It is the first
time in the history of the United States where a president has
taken special interest to call'' such a meeting of Asian-American
leaders.
   The Korean-born Ms. Daub is a former official of the Department
of Health and Human Services. Her husband, Hal Daub, is the former
Republican congressman defeated last year in a Senate race in
Nebraska.

<HEAD>New Forest Fires in Canada</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scattered rain and cooler temperatures
helped bring some fires under control in central Canada on
Wednesday, but 27,000 people were kept from their homes in three
provinces.
   The rain also brought more lightning strikes and new blazes in
far northwestern regions.
   The fires, the region's worst in memory, have driven people from
remote communities in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario
and destroyed 3.7 million acres of forest. No injuries or deaths
have been reported.
   Cooler weather and light rain Wednesday followed temperatures in
the 90s, providing relief for crews and clearing the air of choking
smoke.
   ``The cooler temperatures seem to hold the fires closer to the
ground,'' said Bob Johnston of the Manitoba Natural Resources
Department. ``If we had another three or four days like this we'd
be looking pretty good, I think the panic would be over, but the
forecast is not for that.''
   Instead, warmer, dry weather was expected to return to the
province.
   The fires began several weeks ago and became a serious problem
last week. At last count, about 225 fires were burning in Manitoba,
150 in northern Ontario and about 165 in Saskatchewan. Most have
been caused by lightning.
   In all three provinces about 4.2 million acres of forest have
been destroyed this year, and 3 million acres in Manitoba alone.
   Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon has said the firefighting and
evacuation will cost the local government $30 million.
   The provincial government has declared a state of emergency.
   In Ottawa on Tuesday, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney promised
``every conceivable support'' from the federal government.
   On Wednesday, stranded vacationers and businessmen were driven
south accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police escorts, but
local residents were forced to wait out the blazes in makeshift
dormitories.
   ``We want to be sure that when it is time to go home, it is time
to go home to stay,'' said Mark Tessier, an official of the
Emergency Measures Organization in Thompson.
   The population of the northern mining city has jumped from
15,000 to about 20,000 in the past week as evacuees streamed in
from outlying communities.
   Rainfall in the provinces varied. One region received up to 1.6
inches, while in others it merely drizzled or didn't rain at all.
   In many cases, a north wind helping to blow fires back over
burned out ground instead of pushing them over fresh timber.
   But the bad weather, which in some cases included lightning,
grounded exhausted pilots, who had been flying 12 water bombers
over affected areas on an almost non-stop basis. A few of the more
than 50 helicopters remained in the air.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi's
efforts to get out of jail and back to the style to which he is
accustomed were halted Wednesday when a federal appeals judge put a
stay on his release.
   A lower court had granted Khashoggi a $10 million bail package
Tuesday, his 54th birthday, but prosecutors appealed before he
could post bond.
   Khashoggi, who had been a fugitive until his arrest in
Switzerland on April 18, is charged with helping Ferdinand and
Imelda Marcos in the alleged plunder of the Philippines government
treasury. He has been in jail in New York since his July 19
extradition.
   Judge Lawrence W. Pierce of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals granted the stay pending a ruling on a prosecution appeal
of the bail package. He did not indicate when the ruling might be
made.
   The government's appeal cited Khashoggi's ``unverifiable''
wealth as a reason not to grant bail. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Charles LaBella attached to the appeal a 19-page summary of
Khashoggi's assets that Khashoggi presented to the court last week.
   Khashoggi, once one of the world's wealthiest men, valued his
assets at $141.8 million but said he had $88 million in
liabilities, bringing his estimated net worth to $53.85 million.
   He is said to have been the main financier and middleman of the
Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of illegal U.S. arms sales to
Iran went to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   Calls to Khashoggi's lawyer, Robert Morvillo, were not returned.
Morvillo said Tuesday evening he had raised enough money to meet
the bail.
   Khashoggi had been expected to move to an apartment he owns in
the luxury Olympic Tower building on Fifth Avenue.
   LaBella said Khashoggi should be required to give a detailed
financial disclosure under oath before bail is even considered.
   ``No one can say with certainty what Khashoggi's net worth is _
something that Khashoggi continues to conceal,'' he said.
   Khashoggi's financial summary named 73 companies based in a host
of countries, including Panama, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
Lichtenstein, Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and the
Netherlands _ but it said only 12 were active. The others were
described as dormant, in liquidation or bankruptcy.
   In addition to the New York apartment, it listed a home in Saudi
Arabia and an estate at Malaga, Spain.
   His personal and business debts included an $81,000 credit card
bill and $378,033 in lawyers fees.
   Khashoggi said he had $643,746 in bank accounts in Switzerland,
France, Monte Carlo, Singapore and Canada _ but said the balance in
the Monte Carlo account was only 47 cents.
   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi, the
Marcoses, five other people and the California Overseas Bank in Los
Angeles last October. The ousted president and his wife were
charged with stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets as a cover, was indicted on charges of racketeering,
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. However, the
Swiss government extradited him on the last two charges only.
   He faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on each of
the two charges of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Trial of Khashoggi and his co-defendants is scheduled for early
next year.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Corpses _ Mystery Fungus at Work?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mystery fungus, perhaps from Japan, has
riddled gypsy moths in the Northeast this summer and may turn into
a new weapon against the destructive pests, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   ``This is the first time a fungus has been known to cause a
massive die-off of gypsy moth caterpillars in North America, said
entomologist Ann Hajek of the department's Agricultural Research
Service. ``I saw single trees with thousands of caterpillar
corpses.''
   Hajek, who is based at the agency's laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y.,
has been working to identify the fungus, which was found in the
western Connecticut towns of Wilton and Hamden. She said the same
fungus probably killed the pests in areas of Massachusetts, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Hamphshire.
   ``Whatever the fungus is, it's definitely an addition to our
arsenal of weapons against gypsy moths,'' she said. ``It could
provide a new method for biological control for these pests.''
   Hajek said it's possible that the fungus is Entomophaga
maimaiga, a fungus imported from its native Japan for testing
against gypsy moth caterpillars. But she said no releases of the
Japanese fungus were made in the areas where the ``mystery'' fungus
has been found.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to Recall a Second Generic Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York pharmaceutical company said
Wednesday it will recall a second generic drug because the firm may
have misrepresented a sample of the product to a Food and Drug
Administration inspector.
   Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., has agreed with
an FDA request to recall its generic versions of Orphengesic, a
muscle relaxant, and Orphengesic Forte, the same drug in an
extra-strength formulation, said Barbara Manners, a Par vice
president and general counsel.
   On Monday, Par said it was voluntarily recalling its generic
version of the high-blood-pressure drug Maxzide. The company said
an internal investigation found that product samples given to an
FDA inspector were ``intentionally drawn from a production batch
other than that represented to the inspector.''
   In the case of generic Orphengesic and Orphengesic Forte, the
company ``may have misrepresented'' to the inspector the size of
the production batch from which the sample was taken, Manners said.
   ``Given the fact that it's not clear (whether the batch was
misrepresented), it has to be recalled,'' Manners said.
   She said the company sees ``no immeditate health or safety
problems'' with either the generic Orphengesic drugs and the
generic Maxzide.
   Par pleaded guilty last week in U.S. District Court in Baltimore
to paying illegal gratuities to FDA employees. The charges were
unrelated to the circumstances that led to the product recalls,
Manners said.
   Generic drugs are lower cost but chemically equivalent versions
of brand-name drugs whose patents have expired.

<HEAD>Lonetree Lawyer Says Bloch Cited for Leaving Safe Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix S. Bloch, an American diplomat suspected
of spying for the Soviet Union, was cited for leaving his safe open
in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, according to an attorney who
represented a Marine convicted of espionage.
   Michael Stuhff, an attorney for Marine Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree,
said Wednesday that in late 1986 Lonetree, on a routine patrol,
found Bloch's safe open in his office at the embassy.
   Lonetree, who is serving a 25-year sentence for espionage, wrote
out the security violation in triplicate, sending copies to Bloch,
the embassy security chief and the head of the Marine detachment,
Stuhff said.
   Stuhff said the information about Bloch was brought out at
Lonetree's court-martial.
   Frank Matthews, a State Department spokesman, said security
citations are not common, but most bureaucrats have received at
least one over the course of their careers. The department
generally takes disciplinary action of some sort if more than one
citation is issued.

   The Quebec provincial appeals court Wednesday
upheld an injunction that prevents a 21-year-old woman from having
an abortion, and her attorney said she would appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   The ruling was the latest in a series of legal decisions that
has riveted attention on the issue and increased pressure on the
government for an abortion law.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. interrupted its programming with
the announcement that the Quebec Court of Appeals voted 3-2 to
uphold the injunction barring Chantal Daigle from having an
abortion.
   A former boyfriend, Jean-Guy Tremblay, had sought the
injunction. ``We've won,'' Tremblay told reporters at the Montreal
courthouse where the decision was announced.
   The lawyer for Ms. Daigle, a secretary who is in her 21st week
of pregnancy, said she would appeal to the federal Supreme Court.
``Our client doesn't have seven months to wait,'' lawyer Daniel
Bedard said.
   Defying the Quebec appeals court by seeking an abortion in the
United States could bring a two-year prison sentence and a $42,000
fine.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since January 1988, when
the nation's Supreme Court said the cumbersome procedure required
for approval infringed on women's rights. That ruling and a
decision in a second case last January decriminalized abortion and
said the issue was for a woman and her doctor to decide.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has said legislation will be
introduced this fall when Parliament returns from summer recess.
   ``The government will be responding in what I hope will be an
appropriate way,'' he said recently. ``There are events that have
brought it to the front burner more than has been the case. But I
think nobody would want us to be stampeded by this.''
   Three provincial court decisions issued this month have resulted
in public pressure for a law.
   An Ontario Supreme Court decision threw out an injunction
preventing Barbara Dodd, 22, from having an abortion, and she went
ahead with the procedure immediately.
   But last week Ms. Dodd appeared publicly with Greg Murphy, 23,
who had sought the injunction claiming a father's right, and
criticized abortion rights groups for encouraging her.
   Pro-choice activists who helped advise Ms. Dodd before her
abortion deny that she was encouraged to go ahead against her will.
   In Manitoba, a woman went ahead with an abortion after her
former boyfriend failed to obtain an injunction.
   The Quebec decision involving Ms. Daigle was based on the
province's Charter of Rights.
   ``The child that has been conceived but not born is a reality
that must be taken into account. He is not an inanimate object nor
the property of anyone, but a living human entity distinct from the
mother ... and has the right to life and protection from those who
conceived him,'' wrote Justice Yves Bernier, one of the three who
voted to reject Ms. Daigle's appeal.
   ``Pregnancy is not in itself an attack on a woman's physical
well-being or an interference in her body but a function which is a
fundamental part of her nature. The rule of nature is that
pregnancy must lead to birth,'' Bernier wrote.
   In one of the two dissenting opinions, Justice Christine
Tourigny, the only woman on the panel, said the Quebec Superior
Court erred in upholding the injunction because ``the general
provisions of Quebec law cannot be interpreted as restricting or
forbidding rights guaranteed by the Canadian Constitution.''

   Property tax bills 50 to 200 percent higher than
last year's have provoked an angry outcry that on Wednesday sparked
a petition drive to overhaul the Cook County tax system.
   The petition launched by Patrick Quinn of the Coalition for
Political Honesty seeks a property tax reduction and a limit on the
amount taxes can be increased.
   ``I think people have had it up to here with a system that needs
reform,'' said Quinn. ``It's a soak-the-average-person system and
it's not fair.''
   If the group collects 155,000 signatures, a non-binding
referendum will be placed on Chicago's March 20 primary election
ballot. An additional 130,000 signatures would place it on the Cook
County ballot.
   ``If they raise it any more, I don't know what I'm gonna do,''
said Michael Galgano, a 74-year-old former construction worker who
owns his Northwest Side home. ``I don't have much left in my
savings.''
   Galgano, one of the first to sign the petition, said his bill
was less than $1,000 three years ago, $1,300 two years ago, and is
about $2,000 this year.
   On Monday, 350 angry protesters stormed one alderman's office
demanding property-tax relief.
   ``We're the ones who are most in danger of losing our homes,''
said protester Frank Greco, 72, who lives on a fixed income in a
hard-hit ward. ``We want to send the message that unless they roll
back taxes, people are going to fight forever.''
   The county must share property tax revenues with the school
board, city colleges, streets and sanitation, etc., but it has
demanded an increased share for this year. And county board
president George Dunne has said he needs another increase to expand
crowded jails and hospitals next year.
   The petition calls for a reduction of at least 5 percent in the
1990 property tax levy, a $1,000 homestead exemption and a ceiling
on taxes of no more than 2 percent of the home's market value.
Quinn said some are now paying up to almost 3 percent of their
home's assessed value.
   That percentage of assessed value varies among the county's 108
taxing districts. Officials said the county's share of that is
1.128 per cent of assessed value, up from 0.913 in 1987.
   The plan is based on measures approved by voters in California,
Massachusetts, Missouri and Michigan, Quinn said.
   ``Benjamin Franklin said death and taxes are inevitable, but he
didn't say it's inevitable to be taxed to death,'' said Quinn, a
former member of the county Board of Tax Appeals.
   Quinn contends county tax collecting is based on a 19th century
system that is unfair, confusing and not based on ability to pay.
   He blamed Dunne, saying the county government is inefficient and
padded with patronage jobs.
   Dunne said his hands are tied by an antiquated system he would
like to see reformed. He said he spends 76 cents of every dollar
for a criminal-justice system that demands more every year.
   ``I won't make a promise of reducing something unless I can see
where that can be done, and I don't see it right now,'' Dunne said.
   Jean Lee said her taxes had doubled since the last time she was
billed.
   ``I worked really hard to get the home we have, and now I've got
to give it up'' if rates keep rising, said Ms. Lee, 58, who lives
with her retired husband on the South Side and was among the first
to sign the petition.
   In 1988, Illinoisans paid $7.4 billion in property taxes, equal
to the amounts generated by state income and sales taxes, said
Douglas Whitley, president of the Taxpayers Federation of Illinois.
   ``The problem is the system itself,'' Whitley said.

   Thousands of people demonstrated in
ethnically troubled Soviet Georgia Wednesday, and strikes inspired
by ethnic legislation were reported at 19 factories in Estonia.
   In Latvia, thousands of people demonstrated to press demands for
the republic's sovereignty from Moscow, a journalist in the Baltic
republic said.
   As ethnic conflict increased, a two-week nationwide coal strike
that involved half the nation's 1 million miners drew to a close.
   The official news agency Tass said only 31 coal mines remained
on strike Wednesday. The strikes had threatened to cripple Soviet
industry but most miners returned to work after President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov guaranteed them more
pay, longer vacations and other benefits.
   More than 2,000 people demonstrated Wednesday night outside the
Academy of Sciences building in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital.
Speakers discussed the ethnic violence in the Abkhazia region of
western Georgia and demanded independence and the removal of Soviet
troops stationed in the republic.
   ``Freedom for Georgia,'' read one banner.
   In a report on ethnic violence in Abkhazia, Tass said someone
threw a bomb Tuesday into the yard of a teacher's home in Sukhumi,
capital of the Black Sea resort area, and an explosion at a repair
shop damaged a truck. It said no one was injured.
   At least 21 people have been killed in western Georgia since
July 15, when fighting began between Abkhazians and Georgians.
   ``The situation in Abkhazia and western Georgia is still
tense,'' Tass said. ``Unsanctioned meetings, involving 300 to 3,000
people, were held in Tbilisi, Chiatura and Akhaltsykha in the past
24 hours.''
   It said 70 people were detained for curfew violations Tuesday
and Wednesday and four were arrested for taking part in illegal
demonstrations.
   Abkhazians, a minority in their own region, want more economic
independence and cultural rights. Georgians insist that the fertile
enclave, with its seaside resorts, remain part of the Caucasus
republic, but many also want independence from Moscow.
   Sergei Dandurov, a Georgian dissident who frequently telephones
Western news organizations with reports of unrest, said 10,000
demonstrators in Tbilisi marched past KGB secret police
headquarters Tuesday night. He said some shouted ``The KGB is
Gestapo!'' and a few struck the building's windows.
   Rioters seeking weapons have attacked and looted dozens of
police and military posts in the area.
   Tass said Wednesday that 199 weapons were ``confiscated or
surrendered'' in the previous 24 hours and that authorities had
seized 5,103 since the unrest began.
   Georgian activists are promoting a general strike to support
independence and protest the ethnic violence, but Yuri Goldman of
the official Georgian news agency Gruzinform said only a few
factories were affected.
   A factory engineer, who would not give his name, said workers
showed up at his plant in Tbilisi but ``would rather talk about
politics than work.''
   In the Estonian capital, Tallinn, strike leader Yevgeny
Kolekhnik said about 25,000 people had walked out at 19 plants in
Estonia. Kolekhnik, who works at the Baltic Shipyard, spoke via
telephone to Moscow.
   Tass put the number of striking businesses at about 10.
   Non-Estonians are protesting a proposed election law that would
limit the vote to people with two years of residency in Estonia. It
also would require a candidate to have lived in his electoral
district for five years or in the republic for 10.
   No other Soviet republic has such strict requirements.
   Soviet TV reported that workers at some plants voted to return
to their jobs while the issue is negotiated with the republic's
leaders. The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' showed pickets
outside the huge defense factory Dvigatel carrying signs that read,
``We Demand a Democratic Election Law.''
   Estonia has led the campaign among the Soviet Union's 15
republics for greater economic and political autonomy, and
Estonians complain about the large number of Russian and other
non-Estonian workers brought in to operate major factories.
   Native Estonians are 65 percent of the republic's 1.6 million
people. Many accuse the Russians of destroying Estonia's culture
and language, and the factories of polluting the environment.
   In Riga, the capital of the Baltic republic of Latvia, an
estimated 16,000 people demonstrated Wednesday night to demand that
the local legislature declare the republic's sovereignty,
journalist Alex Grigoriev said in a telephone interview. The
Latvian Supreme Soviet is to consider the issue Thursday, he said.
   The Kremlin has rejected similar declarations by Estonia and the
third Baltic republic, Lithuania.

<HEAD>Officials Say HUD Has Been Reimbursed $72,970</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development has been reimbursed $72,970 owed by the widow and
estate of a one-time broker for the agency's Buffalo, N.Y., office,
officials said Wednesday.
   The department last week collected a check for $24,831 from the
estate of Bernard S. Brady and another for $48,139 from
Manufacturer's and Trader's Trust where Brady had maintained a HUD
escrow account, the Buffalo HUD office said in a release.
   ``Case closed,'' said Joseph Lynch, manager of the Buffalo
office. ``Thanks to the cooperation of Mrs. Brady, Harold Fein (her
lawyer) and Robert Wilmers at M&amp;T, we have recouped HUD monies and
restored Bernie Brady's reputation.''
   The reimbursements came less than a month after The Associated
Press obtained an internal HUD audit which showed Brady had
withheld payments, overbilled HUD and paid himself advances while a
real estate broker and appraiser for the department.
   When Brady died of cancer in 1987, his widow, Maureen, wrote
$20,100 worth of checks on the account, which was in her husband's
name, according to the audit, obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   From 1983 until his death, Brady had been under contract to act
as management broker and closing agent when HUD sold foreclosed
single-family houses _ 70 to 80 a year in Erie County, according to
the Buffalo office. Brady was supposed to forward money and
documents to HUD within 48 hours but his reports were frequently
delinquent, according to the release.
   Discrepancies in the escrow account were reported to HUD in
October 1987 by Fein, attorney for the estate, and Lynch
immediately requested an investigation. But the audit was not
completed until Jan. 19, 1989, which HUD attributed to ``delays
encountered by the competing priorities.''
   When contacted by the AP last month, Lynch and A. Paul Kane,
HUD's regional inspector general for audit, said HUD was still
having trouble collecting the money.
   Brady was one of many closing agents who apparently took
advantage of lax controls at HUD under Secretary Samuel Pierce. The
new secretary, Jack Kemp, has been tightening controls in the wake
of reports that some agents took millions of dollars for their own
use.
   But Lynch said he did not believe Brady had any criminal intent.
   ``He may have kept lousy records but I am convinced Brady was an
honest man,'' Lynch said.

<HEAD>NTSB Probing Engine Records at GE Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators Wednesday began
examining records at the General Electric Co. plant that made the
engines for United Flight 232, while GE awaited the arrival of the
jet's shattered tail engine.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jack Young is
studying GE's manufacturing and maintenance records for the tail
engine. Its fan section apparently disintegrated about 45 minutes
into the July 19 flight from Denver to Chicago. The DC-10 crashed
at Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 people.
   ``The engine was assembled back in 1972, so there are many
records to review,'' said Dwight Weber, spokesman at the plant in
suburban Cincinnati.
   The remains of the tail-mounted No. 2 engine are to be shipped
next week from the crash site to the Evendale plant for dismantling
and inspection under federal supervision, Weber said.
   The plant, which produces engines for commercial and military
jets, has the facilities for such an inspection, while Sioux City
does not, he said.
   ``It will be inspected thoroughly and, I'm sure, torn down and
inspected piece by piece,'' Weber said.
   Weber said he did not know when the engine would arrive, what
its condition is or how long the NTSB would need to complete the
inspection. NTSB's Washington office did not return a telephone
call Wednesday.
   The CF6-6 engine was tailor-made for DC-10 series 10 jets,
including the one that crashed last week. Weber said GE produced
the engine from 1971 to 1981, when McDonnell Douglas sold the last
DC-10 series 10 jets. GE now makes a successor engine _ the
CF6-80C2 _ for wide-body jets.
   The CF6-6 engine established a record of reliability during 17
million flight hours in commercial service, Weber said.
   In Boston, FAA spokeswoman Gail Lattrell said FAA records showed
that the CF6-6 has been involved in 14 accidents or incidents. The
FAA defines an accident as one that causes injury or at least
substantial damage to an engine. An incident involves lesser damage
to an engine, Ms. Lattrell said.
   She said she had no details of the 14 occurrences.
   Weber said the CF6-6 had never been involved in a major accident
before the Iowa crash. The FAA's Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma
City reported no record of any service problems with the No. 2
engine on United's Flight 232.
   Those accompanying Young to GE-Evendale included representatives
of the Federal Aviation Administration, GE, United Airlines,
McDonnell Douglas and the Airline Pilots Association and
International Association of Machinists unions, the NTSB said. The
group is one of eight teams set up by the NTSB to investigate
various aspects of the crash.

<HEAD>Woman Angered Over Dismissal of Rape Case Shoots Man She Accused</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman enraged by the district attorney's
refusal to prosecute a rape case shot her alleged attacker eight
times, then bludgeoned him with a beer bottle, police said
Wednesday.
   The man was in critical condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Elizabeth Gooden, 26, and her brother, Leroy Gooden, 31, were
booked for investigation of attempted murder and held without bail,
detectives said. Police allege the brother ran off with the gun
used in the attack.
   Miss Gooden called police Friday and alleged that she had been
raped by Wilson Picquet, 38, after a night of drinking in his
apartment, Detective John Bunch said. Picquet was booked for
investigation of rape.
   Miss Gooden, Picquet, detectives and a deputy district attorney
met Tuesday to examine the case. Picquet said Miss Gooden had
agreed to have sex with him, but that the couple then argued.
   The deputy district attorney dismissed the case, saying it
hinged on Miss Gooden's word against Picquet's.
   Bunch said the woman gave no indication that she was upset
enough to take any action against Picquet, who lived in the same
apartment complex.
   Later, when Picquet walked through the gates of the apartment
building, Bunch said, Miss Gooden fired one shot at close range
into his chest.
   She then stood over him and fired seven more shots from a
.380-caliber automatic and finally pitched the beer bottle at him,
the detective said.
   Miss Gooden allegedly handed the gun to her brother, who ran
from the area. He was arrested a few blocks away _ without the gun,
Bunch said.

   A federal judge Wednesday approved portions of
a drug-testing program at the Department of Education but blocked
random testing for 88 data processors at the agency.
   U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Green said that although the
government claims the data processors have access to sensitive
data, the department ``has not concretely identified the nature of
this information nor the safeguards that would prevent its improper
dissemination.''
   She approved random drug testing for 13 employees with access to
top secret information and gave the go-ahead for drug testing of
nine motor vehicle operators as well as a guard for the secretary
of education.
   In ruling on a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of
Government Employees, Green also approved testing when there is
reasonable suspicion that any employee is using drugs. She rejected
the labor union's request for a restriction that prior to such
testing, a supervisor must have individualized suspicion that an
employee is impaired while on duty.

<HEAD>Knocking Aluminum, Durbin Goes to Bat for Wood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crack of a wooden baseball bat is far more
appealing to Democratic Rep. Richard Durbin of Illinois than the
ping of an aluminum stick, and he revealed his feelings in a speech
to the House on Wednesday.
   ``I rise to condemn the desecration of a great American symbol.
No, I am not referring to flag burning; I am referring to the
baseball bat,'' Durbin said in a brief speech.
   Durbin, who represents the Springfield area, a district
populated by fans of the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs,
bemoaned the ``extinction'' of the wooden baseball bat.
   ``Are we willing to hear the crack of a bat replaced by the
dinky ping? Are we ready to see the Louisville slugger replaced by
the aluminum ping dinger? Is nothing sacred?'' Durbin asked.
   The congressman said baseball fans have been forced to endure
``countless indignities by those who just can't leave well enough
alone.''
   ``Designated hitters, plastic grass, uniforms that look like
pajamas, chicken clowns dancing on the baselines, and of course the
most heinous sacrilege, lights in Wrigley Field,'' he said.
   Durbin concluded that ``if we forsake the great Americana of
broken-bat singles and pine tar, we will have certainly lost our
way as a nation.''
   The congressman's comments were prompted by a recent cover story
in Sports Illustrated on the increased use of aluminum baseball
bats.

   A bus filled with gamblers bound
for Atlantic City overturned Wednesday on a highway, injuring
nearly 40 people, 10 of them seriously, officials said.
   Passersby stopped along the Garden State Parkway to help
passengers, many of them elderly, off the bus through emergency
exits. By the time state police arrived, two people remained on the
bus screaming for help.
   Twenty ambulances and paramedic units carried 38 people,
including the bus driver, to four hospitals, medical officials said.
   ``A majority of people have minor cuts and bruises and back
pains,'' said Dr. James Bagnell, director of emergency services for
Atlantic City Medical Center. He said most of the serious injuries
were broken bones.
   The driver, not immediately identified, complained of a
mechanical problem with the bus.
   ``It appears the brakes locked up and in an attempt to gain
control, she tipped the bus,'' said Trooper David Smith. Smith said
investigators were trying to determine how fast the bus was
traveling.
   Much of Atlantic City's casino business depends on buses that
arrive hourly, bringing gamblers for several hours or a day in the
casinos.
   On Nov. 29, a bus to Atlantic City carrying elderly people, most
from New York City, flipped onto its side, injuring 49 people. In
August, a bus taking gamblers home from Atlantic City struck a New
Jersey Transit bus, injuring 21 people.
   There were 14 people at the Atlantic City hospital, 10 at
Galloway Township, nine at Shore Memorial Hospital at Somers Point
and five William B. Kessler Memorial Hospital in Hammonton, Bagnell
said.
   Bagnell said he expected most of the injured to stay in the
hospital overnight. Officials at Shore Memorial said only five of
the nine people brought there would need to stay overnight.
   State police said the passengers boarded the Saddle River Tours
bus at Rutherford in northern New Jersey and were bound for Caesars
Atlantic City casino hotel.
   The accident caused a traffic backup of eight to 10 miles.

<HEAD>Angolan Ambassador Says Plane Crash Should Not Hinder Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A plane crash that killed 42 people in
Angola should not stop the peace process there, even though the
government blamed the crash on a rebel missile, the Angolan
Ambassador was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Earlier, the Portuguese news agency, Lusa, quoted an
unidentified military source in Luanda as saying the plane attack
and a recent increase in rebel activity, might force the government
to postpone peace talks, scheduled to resume Monday in Zaire.
   Rui Mingas, recently appointed ambassador to Lisbon, said in an
interview that the crash ``should not hinder the continuation of
negotiations'' with the rebels.
   An excerpt from his Tuesday interview with state television was
published Wednesday in the state-owned daily Diario de Noticias.
   A military official in Luanda, the Angolan capital, said the
Soviet-built plane, a twin-propeller Antonov 26, was forced to
crash-land in Angola on Sunday after being hit by a missile.
   He said the missile was fired by the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rebels
were surrounding the crash site Wednesday and were shelling
government troops to prevent them collecting what he called
``irrefutable evidence'' that the plane was shot down by rebels
with a Stinger missile.
   In Washington, UNITA issued a statement denying its forces shot
down the plane. The group said it suspects a government faction
mounted the attack to undermine the peace talks by throwing the
blame on rebels.
   The statement said the rebels were still committed to reaching a
permanent settlement to the country's 14-year war.
   At a Jun. 22 African summit in Zaire, Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi sealed a truce in
Angola's 14-year civil war with a historic handshake.
   Both sides have accused the other of violating the ensuing
cease-fire, which lasted only a week. According to a Lusa dispatch
Wednesday, UNITA attacks in the past week have left 115 soldiers
and civilians dead, 218 injured, and 31 missing.
   But both went back to the negotiating table anyway. The last
round of talks ended Saturday under the mediation of Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko.
   UNITA, with Western support, has been fighting to force the
Cuban-backed Angolan government to share power since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The rebels still receive between $15 million and $18 million in
U.S. military assistance a year. The aid is said to include stinger
missiles.

   A probate judge has upheld a will that
left custody of a 17-month-old boy to the mother's female companion.
   However, a lawyer for the child's grandparents said they will
continue to fight for guardianship.
   ``The decision and the hearings really dealt only with the
admission of the will. There really wasn't any attempt to evaluate
the fitness of the candidates for guardianship. We think there
ought to be complete and professional evaluation,'' said Patrick
Monaghan Jr., who is representing Elsa and Philip Hamilton of
Montvale, N.J.
   Susan Hamilton died in a May 15 car accident. Her will names her
companion of 12 years, Susan Bellemare, as guardian of Collin
Philip Hamilton, a son she conceived by artificial insemination.
   Hamilton's parents had contested the will, saying Bellemare
exerted ``undue influence'' on their daughter. They also claimed
Bellemare's roles as guardian, as well as trustee and executor of
the estate, presented a conflict.
   But a judge upheld the will Tuesday, in a case that lawyers
believe could set a legal precedent in Vermont by defining the
rights of two people of the same sex who raise children together.
   Judge L. John Cain of Chittenden Probate Court ruled the will
was executed in accordance with legal requirements.
   ``Susan Bellemare was examined and is found to be mentally
competent and physically able'' to be Collin's guardian, he also
wrote in a four-page decision.
   Bellemare, who has had custody since last month, could not be
reached for comment. Her lawyer, Susan Murray of Middlebury,
declined comment.
   Hamilton and Bellemare were nurses at the Medical Center
Hospital of Vermont in Burlington, where Bellemare still works.
They also owned a house together in Waterbury.
   Both women and the child were involved in the May 15 accident.
Collin had been in New Jersey with his grandparents since the
crash, but Bellemare gained custody after a hearing June 30. The
grandparents were allowed visitation rights.

   Steve Rubell, the co-owner of Studio 54 who
reigned over New York's nightlife at the height of the disco craze
until his arrest for skimming club receipts, died Wednesday. He was
45.
   Rubell, who was convicted of tax evasion at the height of his
club's popularity, died of complications from hepatitis and septic
shock at Beth Israel Hospital, said publicist Dan Klores, who would
not elaborate. Septic shock is the term for shock, involving
lowered blood pressure and other symptoms, that develops in the
presence of severe infections.
   Rubell befriended celebrities from Liza Minnelli to Madonna
during his 25 years of business dealings with college buddy and
longtime partner Ian Schrager.
   The pair became the toast of Manhattan nightlife after opening
Studio 54 on April 26, 1977, playing host to Andy Warhol, Bianca
Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor and Cheryl Tiegs night after night.
Rubell's activities earned prominent mention in ``The Andy Warhol
Diaries,'' a current best-seller.
   Rubell, the extrovert of the pair, could often be found hanging
out inside, being seen with the stars while checking out business.
His mother counted the club's receipts in the basement.
   Rubell often worked the club's front door, selectively admitting
celebrities and night-crawlers, spurning others queued outside.
Among those he failed to recognize and refused: John Kennedy Jr.
and Warren Beatty.
   The high life ended with a 1979 tax evasion conviction after
authorities discovered $300,000 in cash in the trunk of Schrager's
car.
   The pair tried to avoid prosecution with a deal to testify
against President Jimmy Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan,
claiming the official had snorted cocaine in their club. That deal
went nowhere and Jordan was never charged.
   In January 1980, Rubell and Schrager were sentenced to 3{ years
in prison but reduced their sentences by turning in several other
club owners. They were released from prison on Jan. 30, 1981, and
sold Studio 54 a short time later.
   Rubell and Schrager returned to New York, channeling their
efforts into the hotel business. Within four years, they were
operating Morgans hotel and running another nightclub, the
Palladium.
   Once again, Rubell became a club scene presence. On opening
night at the Palladium, Boy George, actor Matt Dillon and other
celebrities turned out and the club took off.
   The pair continued their hotel work, renovating and reopening
the Royalton hotel in midtown Manhattan. They were in the process
of renovating the Century Paramount hotel off Times Square and also
had bought the Barbizon Hotel.
   Rubell also discussed plans to develop a resort in Florida or
the Caribbean.
   Rubell is survived by his parents, a brother, a niece and a
nephew.
   A private funeral service was planned Thursday.

   Raymond Buckey, the chief defendant in the
McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, took the witness stand
Wednesday and denied that he ever molested children or played
``naked games'' with preschool students.
   Buckey, beginning what was expected to be lengthy testimony,
also immediately denied he had ever molested the child whose
allegations led to the first charges in the marathon molestation
case.
   ``Did you ever hold (the child)?'' asked Buckey's attorney,
Danny Davis.
   ``No,'' Buckey said firmly.
   ``Did you ever touch (him)?'' asked Davis.
   ``No,'' said Buckey.
   Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are
charged with more than 60 counts of molestation and a shared count
of conspiracy. Now in its 27th month, their trial has been the
longest criminal trial in Los Angeles history. The case has been in
the court system for more than five years.
   Buckey answered no to a series of questions about whether he had
molested the child or sodomized him. He testified he has never
sodomized anyone.
   ``Have you ever touched a child ... to obtain sexual
gratification?'' asked Davis.
   ``Never,'' said Buckey.
   Denying the accusations of another child who testified against
him, Buckey said he could not have molested the child because he
had never met her and did not work at his family's preschool when
she was a pupil.
   ``The preliminary hearing is the first time I ever saw (her) in
my life,'' he testified.
   Outside court, Buckey was asked why small children would testify
to molestations if they never happened. ``I think adults have had a
lot of influence on these children. That's where it's coming
from,'' he said.
   Buckey described to jurors his work as an aide to teachers at
the family-owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. He said he worked
there until the end of summer 1983, when it was first alleged that
he had molested children.
   He was arrested in August 1983 and released when charges were
dropped, he said, but then rearrested March 22, 1984.
   In the six years since he was first accused, Buckey said he has
never been asked by any law enforcement officer whether he molested
children.
   ``Were you ever questioned by anyone in law enforcement about
what did or did not happen in the preschool?'' asked Davis.
   ``Never,'' said Buckey.
   The defendant, who was recently released on bail after spending
some five years in jail, was deeply tanned and wearing a dark blue
sports jacket and khaki-colored slacks.
   He appeared nervous and at first answered in such a soft voice
that Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he could not hear
the witness. After his microphone was adjusted, Buckey sat back and
began to answer in a stronger voice.
   The defense, in its ninth month of presentation, has featured
testimony from former teachers and students from McMartin
Pre-School who said they never saw children molested or animals
killed.
   Mrs. Buckey took the stand to say she never did anything
improper and believed her son was innocent.
   The prosecution spent 14 months presenting testimony from 61
witnesses, including nine children who claimed they had been raped,
sodomized or forced to have oral copulation at the now-closed
McMartin school.
   Pounders said recently he saw no end to the trial before 1990.
   He has voiced repeated concerns about the toll the case has
taken on jurors. The trial started with 12 jurors and six
alternates. Today, only one alternate remains.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
said Wednesday that warring Cambodian factions will meet again to
try to resolve differences over how they should be represented an
an international conference.
   Sihanouk said the leaders of the four factions would meet
Thursday at the chateau in suburban La Celle-Saint-Cloud where
talks broke down Tuesday.
   However, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said no meeting
would take place there. It was not immediately clear whether the
factions could meet at another location.
   The conference begins Sunday, two months before Vietnam is to
complete its troop withdrawal from Cambodia, where fighting
continues.
   Along the Thai-Cambodian border Wednesday, Cambodian government
forces shelled at least four Thai villages as part of an
intensified campaign against Cambodian guerrillas in the area, Thai
military officers said.
   Buddhist monks ran into bunkers around a monastery in Ban Noan
Sao Aee as shells fell on the area. Other villages shelled were
Klong Nam Saay, Ban Nung and Ban Tote Charoen. There were no
reports of deaths.
   France, the former colonial ruler of Cambodia, and Indonesia are
co-chairing the conference in Paris, which will involve nearly 20
nations.
   Negotiations between leaders of the warring Cambodian factions _
Sihanouk's three-party guerrilla resistance and Prime Minister Hun
Sen _ broke down Tuesday in a dispute over the composition and
seating of the Cambodian delegation.
   Hun Sen is demanding that Cambodia be represented by two
delegations: his Vietnamese-installed government and the guerrilla
coalition. That would deny the communist Khmer Rouge, the strongest
guerrilla faction, an independent voice.
   The other two guerrilla factions are the non-communist forces of
Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   Sihanouk wants Cambodia to be represented as a single unit.
   ``We definitely refuse to let the world see that we are two
Cambodias,'' Sihanouk told reporters at a news conference
Wednesday. ``We let France know that in such a case, we will not
attend the conference ... (and) the results of the conference will
not be valid.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to topple the Khmer
Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of people in a more than three-year reign of terror.
   Sihanouk insists the Khmer Rouge be included in the peace
process, saying such a move will contain them and ensure security.
He maintains the real danger is Vietnamese ``colonization'' of
Cambodia.
   ``The Khmer Rouge are monsters. This is understood,'' he said.
``But that is no reason for us to become a protectorate of
Vietnam.''
   Sihanouk claimed that Hun Sen wants two separate Cambodian
delegations to give his own government legitimacy.
   The majority of nations recognize the Coalition Government of
Democratic Kampuchea, of which Sihanouk is president. It holds
Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.
   The disagreement over representation at the conference also
includes how Cambodia's leaders should be seated at the huge
rectangular table at which the foreign ministers of the
participating nations will gather.
   Sihanouk said he will propose that the four parties be seated as
separate units, in alphabetical order, under the banner of Cambodia.
   Barring an accord, Sihanouk and Hun Sen have indicated the
conference could proceed without a Cambodian delegation, dealing
with international aspects of the Cambodian conflict. In such a
case, ``I will go, but as an observer,'' Sihanouk said.

   Wearing shiny pilot's wings and praising airline
food, 106-year-old Mary Elam fulfilled a 20-year-old wish to ride
in an airplane Wednesday as she landed here amid a throng of
applauding travelers.
   Miss Elam was presented with a dozen roses as she disembarked
from a Delta Air Lines flight at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport. She was accompanied by her guardian, Charlotte King, and
Bill Edmiston, a nurse at the nursing home where Miss Elam lives in
Xenia, Ohio, southeast of Dayton.
   She arrived in Atlanta at mid-afternoon, and returned to Dayton
on another flight within a couple of hours.
   ``I'm all right,'' she told her guardian and traveling
companion, Charlotte King, upon leaving the plane.
   Passengers waiting to board their flights gathered around the
arrival gate to greet Miss Elam, who seemed startled by all the
attention.
   ``The least you could do is smile, Mary!'' said Edmiston.
   Miss Elam began her daylong adventure at Dayton International
Airport, where she boarded her flight and took a window seat. She
said the best part of her flight was ``when we got way up high.''
   ``I liked the flight. I liked all of it,'' she said. ``The food
was very good.''
   Was the ride everything she expected?
   ``Yes,'' Miss Elam said. ``And more.''
   Miss Elam said she wanted to fly because she ``just wanted to
try anything anyone else does.'' She said she wants to fly again
but hasn't decided where she wants to go.
   Miss Elam, a nurse during World War I, said the plane ride was
her first major trip since about 1910, when she traveled to
California by train for a world fair.
   Mrs. King, a friend of Miss Elam's for about 50 years, said the
elderly woman had been expressing a desire to fly for the past 20
years. ``She said, `I want to fly before I die,''' Mrs. King said.
   Miss Elam brought up the subject again one recent Sunday, ``so I
thought, `Well, why not?' And after getting her doctor's approval,
we proceeded,'' Mrs. King said.
   So Mrs. King's sister, Mary Anne Howe, arranged the one-day trip
through Delta, which is based in Atlanta. Mrs. King's son, Keith, a
painting contractor in Xenia, paid for the tickets and arranged for
a limousine to take Miss Elam to the airport in Dayton.
   Delta spokesman Mike Detrick said the airline arranged an
economy ticket for Miss Elam, but he said he did not know how much
it cost.
   Once in Atlanta, Miss Elam met another Mary Elam, a Delta Air
Lines employee. The two embraced briefly.
   ``I thought, `Someone with my name? 106 years old?''' said Ms.
Elam, 37. ``I want to know the secret of her success.''

   The Democratic-controlled House voted
Wednesday to sharply limit production money for President Bush's
costly stealth bomber, pressing the Pentagon to come up with a
program cheaper than the current $70 billion.
   ``The B-2 bomber is in serious trouble,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., prior to House approval of the measure, which put off a
decision on the final fate of the radar-evading bomber until next
year.
   The crucial vote Wednesday was 257-160, with 49 Republicans
joining 208 Democrats to limit production of the
half-billion-dollar plane.
   The House action, part of its work on the $295 billion military
budget, was a setback for Bush, who personally lobbied lawmakers
for the aircraft.
   The administration suffered another budget cut later in the day
when the House approved an amendment to reduce by $502 million the
$1.1 billion in spare missiles and for a rail basing system Bush
requested for the MX missile. The vote, which was 224-197, does not
affect the nearly $800 million earmarked for the missiles.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on Capitol Hill to meet with
lawmakers, said House passage of the B-2 amendment ``creates
problems for the program.''
   ``But at least it lets us get through the House with the program
having been approved and now we'll go to conference, hopefully with
a stronger position from the Senate,'' said Cheney, a former
congressman from Wyoming.
   ``Anything that's done by way of delay or stretch-out is simply
going to raise the cost of the program,'' he added.
   The production-limiting amendment, sponsored by Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Synar,
allows the administration production funds for only two new bombers
in 1990 and 1991. The Pentagon had sought eight bombers.
   The action sets up a confrontation with the Senate, which voted
98-1 Tuesday to back the bomber if it meets flight test and
radar-evasion standards.
   The Senate trimmed Bush's $4.7 billion B-2 request for the next
fiscal year by a relatively modest $300 million.
   Once the House and Senate complete their versions of the defense
bill, the two chambers will meet in conference to work out a final
measure. The administration expressed the hope that a B-2 program
resembling the White House request will still prevail.
   ``The Aspin amendment regrettably delays the program. It weakens
our negotiating position (in arms-reduction talks) since it shows
less than a full commitment to the manned bomber leg of our
triad,'' said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk. ``We hope to
restore the program in conference.''
   The House amendment on the bomber would meet the
administration's full request for research and development work
over the next two years but would limit procurement money and then
cut it off unless Congress acts again.
   Aspin argued Wednesday that the Air Force, which wants 132
aircraft, has ``hardly tested this plane.''
   ``What this amendment does is say slow down the program, do the
research and development and fence the program,'' said the
Wisconsin Democrat, who described his approach as one that would
provide time to ``come up with a program that is politically
acceptable and more affordable.''
   Following the vote, Synar said, ``The message today is that
Northrop, the Air Force, the administration have got to get this
program in order.''
   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., said bluntly of the B-2, ``We didn't
ground it but we sure clipped its wings.''
   Aspin said that in the next year the administration must ``make
the argument about where the Soviets are going with their air
defenses ... convince us that it's worth spending some money on
this program.''
   The manned, bat-winged bomber, which costs $530 million a copy,
is built to penetrate Soviet air defenses.
   Earlier in the day, the House rejected an even harsher amendment
sponsored by the odd coalition of liberal Democrat Ron Dellums of
California and Republicans John Kasich of Ohio and Rowland. It
would have stopped production after the 13 planes now in the
pipeline are completed, with no new ones started in 1990 or 1991.
   Rowland reminded members that the Pentagon is seeking more than
$24 billion over a three-year peak spending period in the 1990s for
the bomber. ``Does anyone in this chamber believe we'll spend $8
billion in one year?'' he asked.
   But the House rejected that argument by a vote of 279-144.
   The House also rejected an amendment that would have effectively
endorsed the administration's overall $70 billion program, though
cutting $800 million from Bush's request of $4.7 billion for the
program in fiscal 1990. The vote was 244-176.
   The House approved an amendment extending the current law
limiting deployment of the MX missile to 50 to all deployed MX
missiles.
   But the House turned down an amendment to cancel the MX mobile
missile and single-warhead Midgetman missile, rejected a measure to
cancel the Midgetman only and turned back a provision that would
have prohibited the Air Force from using research and development
money on moving the existing 50 MX missiles from fixed silos to
railroad cars.
   The House Armed Services Committee had endorsed the
administration's request of $1.1 billion for the MX missile and
$100 million for the Midgetman.

   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission task force
said Wednesday the nation's nuclear power plants have enough
storage space for highly radioactive spent fuel until 2025, even if
the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada is rejected.
   In a report to commissioners, the commission's Waste Confidence
Review Group said a new site could be selected and put into
operation by then if necessary.
   A deadline of 2025 would push back the previous deadline of
2007-2009 for an ``off-site storage solution'' that the commission
gave in its previous ``Waste Confidence Decision,'' a
court-required assurance that spent fuel will find a permanent
storage place.
   The review group told the commission that the original dates
were set to meet the requirements of the original court case, and
are ``not a requirement for (protection of) safety or (the)
environment.''
   Group leader Robert Bernero, director of nuclear materials
safety and safeguards for the commission, said new, safer storage
technology for spent fuel and the trend toward longer use of
nuclear reactors will help relieve some pressure to find a central
storage site.
   Spent fuel can be safely stored on site at least 30 years after
a plant is mothballed, Bernero said. A plant could be licensed for
40 years of operation, and then extended for 30 years, with fuel
being stored for 30 years on top of that, allowing storage up to
100 years before the spent fuel would have to be stored permanently.
   Yucca Mountain, the site mandated in the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act Amendment of 1987, could prove unsuitable, the task force said.
It noted that Congress has banned detailed studies of any other
site.
   The other two possible sites being considered were the Hanford
nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash. and a site in Deaf Smith
County, Texas.
   Initial construction work on shafts aimed at detailed
investigation of the Nevada site is supposed to begin in November.
Under the present timetable, spent fuel would start moving into the
site in the year 2003. The site is limited by law to 70,000 metric
tons.
   Figures supplied Wednesday project 100,000 metric tons of spent
fuel by the year 2025.
   The Nevada governor opposes the project, questions have arisen
about geological faults and potential volcanic activity at the
site, and the NRC staff is concerned that Environmental Protection
Agency standards may be unusable or untimely.
   Should the Yucca Mountain project have to be scrapped at the
turn of the century, that would give 25 years for a new site to be
screened and put into operation, the group said, citing Energy
Department projections.
   Insisting that he was describing a ``very pessimistic
assumption'' and not making a prediction, Bernero said the group
decided, ``Let us postulate the maximum sort of delay one can
envision.''
   The commission must reaffirm its ``Waste Confidence Decision''
every five years. The commission will ask for public comment on the
present report.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Issues Subpoenas in Probe of Fauntroy, Savage's Son</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: INSERTS graf 6: ``Justice Department,'' with no comment from
Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has issued subpoenas to
several former employees of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., as part of an
investigation into D.C. Del. Walter Fauntroy's employment of
Savage's son, sources familiar with the case said Wednesday.
   The Justice Department is investigating whether Thomas John
Savage, son of Rep. Savage, regularly reported for work while he
was on Fauntroy's payroll for most of the period between September
1987 and June 1988.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said
three of the people under subpoena worked in Savage's Chicago
office during that period. The three have indicated they frequently
saw the younger Savage in the office, the sources said.
   All of those who received subpoenas are scheduled to testify
before a grand jury in Washington during the next two weeks, said
the sources.
   The grand jury was convened in May, a month after the Justice
Department expanded an investigation to examine all of Fauntroy's
hiring practices over the past five years.
   Justice Department David Runkel said he could not comment on the
case.
   The younger Savage, who now works as an affirmative action
officer for the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District, was not in
his office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment.
   Rep. Savage did not return three phone calls to his Washington
office.
   Fauntroy spokeswoman Livonia Perriman-Fairfax said none of
Fauntroy's current employees has been subpoenaed.
   The subpoenas are the latest step in a probe that began last
December after The Associated Press reported that Thomas Savage was
frequently in Chicago while he was on Fauntroy's payroll.
   For part of the time in question, he was a candidate for the
Illinois Legislature, and also was on leave from Fauntroy's payroll.
   Fauntroy says Savage took an unpaid leave from his job for 10
weeks between Jan. 1 and March 15, 1988, to wage the campaign.
House payroll records obtained by the AP show Savage was paid
$1,459.50 in January 1988, an amount equal to nearly three weeks'
pay. In all, he earned $21,398 while on Fauntroy's payroll.
   Illinois election records show that Savage swore he had resided
continuously for two years in his Chicago home, including the
period he was on Fauntroy's payroll. The records also include
numerous affidavits the younger Savage filed in Chicago on behalf
of his father's 1988 reelection campaign.
   The younger Savage told the AP he was in Chicago ``for a couple
of weekends'' and during holidays during the period he was on
Fauntroy's payroll.
   Fauntroy says the younger Savage worked diligently on an effort
to gain statehood for the District of Columbia. The younger Savage
has said publicly that he did not regularly report to Fauntroy's
office and did little more than stuff envelopes when he was there.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military leader indicated
Wednesday that the 6-year-old civil war in the south would be
brought to an end soon.
   ``Some bright news will be heared in the upcoming few days'' Lt.
Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir told reporters at Khartoum airport,
according to the official Sudan News Agency. He returned from a
summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
   The civil war has partly been blamed for starvation in the
south, and a relief worker said that a village where 8,000 people
starved to death last summer faces a similar crisis this year
because of insufficient food stocks.
   El-Bashir said President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt had conferred at
the summit with John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army, and explained the ``orientations'' of el-Bashir's
regime.
   He said Mubarak asked Garang to ``cooperate'' with el-Bashir's
government to put an end to the civil war, which began in 1983 when
the rebels took up arms to demand greater regional autonomy and
economic and administrative reforms.
   Mubarak and el-Bashir also met in Khartoum on Sunday when the
Egyptian leader was on his way to the African organization's annual
meeting. Mubarak and other African leaders tried to arrange a
meeting between el-Bashir and Garang, but sources at the conference
said the rebel leader declined.
   Egypt has a historical interest in Sudan because the Nile river
runs through both countries on its way to the Mediterranean Sea.
   El-Bashir said putting an end to the civil war was among his top
motives in launching his June 30 military coup that toppled the
civilian regime of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi.
   A Western relief worker said donors were studying possibilities
for sending more food to Abyei, a village 500 miles southwest of
Khartoum.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United Nations estimates that 250,000 people died as a result of
starvation and civil war in southern Sudan in 1988. The world body
says 100,000 more could die this year unless its huge relief
operation to send 105,000 tons of food into the south succeeds.
   About 70,000 tons of supplies will have been moved by the end of
July, relief officials say.
   The Western official said Abyei received 3,000 tons of food,
normally enough to get 26,000 inhabitants and refugees through the
rainy season, from June to November. During that time, heavy rains
isolate many areas.
   However, the official said in the past few weeks up to 20,000
more refugees have arrived in Abyei, and ``the food is no longer
enough to last them through the rainy season.''
   The official also said many refugees were streaming in daily to
nearby Aweil, where 4,000 other people starved last year. However,
he had no details on food supplies there.
   Sudan's civil war started in 1983. Christians and animists are
fighting for more autonomy from the Arab Moslem majority government
in the north. The rebels claim to control up to 95 percent of the
southern countryside.
   The fighting has forced up to 2 million southerners to flee
their homes and livelihoods, making them dependent on relief food.
About 23 million people live in all of Sudan.

<HEAD>Jurors Begin Deliberations In Long-Running Night Stalker Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in the
``Night Stalker'' serial murder case, weighing whether a lanky
drifter from Texas committed 13 slayings that terrorized California
four summers ago.
   Richard Ramirez, 29, faces 43 separate verdicts, including 30
non-murder felonies, and he could be sentenced to death if
convicted. The same jury will consider a penalty recommendation for
the El Paso, Texas, native.
   The 12-member panel heard testimony in the courtroom of Superior
Court Judge Michael Tynan from Jan. 30 to July 10, following six
months of jury selection for the highly publicized case.
   Witnesses testified that one victim's eyes were gouged out. A
survivor identified Ramirez as her attacker and said she was raped
and sodomized after her husband was murdered. She alleged that
Ramirez told her during the attack to ``swear to Satan.''
   There also was testimony of inverted pentagrams left at some of
the murder scenes and of Ramirez's own claims during the trial and
preliminary hearing that he was indeed the Night Stalker.
   Defense attorney attorney Ray Clark called his client's
statements jailhouse bravado.
   Courtroom arguments covered more than 8,000 pages of transcript,
some of it concerning arguments over the demeanor of one of
Ramirez's attorneys, Daniel P. Hernandez of San Jose.
   Most recently, Hernandez disappeared from the court for an
afternoon session. He later said he simply failed to tell Clark of
his plans.
   During the trial, the prosecution called 138 witnesses while the
defense called 38 people. There were 654 exhibits admitted into
evidence _ 574 for the prosecution, 80 for the defense.
   When jurors reach verdicts, they will have 106 verdict forms to
fill out, including those asking about findings of facts that could
enhance penalties for the non-murder charges and bring a death
penalty for the slayings.
   Clark told jurors there was enough reasonable doubt raised in
the case to keep them from convicting Ramirez.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin reminded the panel of
the similarity of the crimes and the several surviving victims who
identified Ramirez as the man who entered their homes through
unlocked doors and windows during hot summer nights in 1985.

   A former bank officer pleaded guilty Wednesday
in federal court to conspiring with ex-Illinois congressman Robert
Hanrahan to violate currency reporting requirements in a
money-laundering operation.
   Roger C. Schultz, who was a senior vice president at the
National Bank of Washington, entered the plea to a charge of
conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by helping
Hanrahan and another man evade the requirement of reporting
currency transactions of more than $10,000.
   Hanrahan pleaded guilty previously in the matter and is awaiting
sentencing.
   A central figure in the case was Charles LeChasney, a political
consultant who testified as a government witness in last month's
criminal trial of former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga.
   Schultz advised LeChasney and Hanrahan in 1987 about the bank's
capability of detecting related accounts, according to a criminal
information filed by the U.S. attorney's office. LeChasney and
Hanrahan used Schultz's advice by setting up three corporate
accounts in such a way as to avoid the bank's detection ability.
   LeChasney and Hanrahan then laundered $300,000 in cash supplied
to them by an undercover IRS agent posing as a representative of a
criminal organization and LeChasney and Hanrahan received more than
$10,000 in commissions for their efforts, according to a statement
issued by the U.S. attorney's office.
   Schultz faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine
when he is sentenced Sept. 20. He entered the plea before U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   LeChasney, an admitted con man convicted of money laundering,
was a government witness last month against Swindall, who was
convicted of 10 counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his
1987 dealings with LeChasney.
   The lies concerned an $850,000 loan deal from LeChasney's Gulf
Coast Mortgage Corp.
   Swindall lost his congressional seat last November.

   A man already accused of killing a New
Mexico store clerk was charged Wednesday with the shooting death of
two convenience store clerks in his hometown.
   Gregg Francis Braun is also a suspect in a similar slaying in
Ardmore, Okla., and prosecutors there announced Wednesday they had
dismissed a first-degree murder charge filed against another man in
that case. The charge against Michael Frank Greene was dropped in
part because evidence turned up that he could not physically have
been at the shooting scene last week.
   Braun, 28, son of a Garden City lawyer and brother of the Ellig
County attorney, is a suspect in the Oklahoma slaying as well as
the killing of another store clerks Texas. Greene also has been
charged in the Texas killing.
   Braun was charged Wednesday in the July 19 shooting deaths of
two women who were abducted from separate stores in Garden City and
shot in the head. Their bodies were dumped three miles apart north
of the city in southwestsern Kansas.
   Braun, arraigned Monday on a charge of murder in Sunday's
shooting death of a store clerk in Springer, N.M., was charged in
Kansas with two counts of murder, aggravated robbery and aggravated
kidnapping.
   He was being held in New Mexico on a $1 million bond. Kansas
authorities also set his bond at $1 million.
   Police also describe Braun a suspect in the July 20 shooting
death of a man at a photo processing shop in Pampa, Texas, and the
July 21 slaying of a clerk in a flower shop at Ardmore, Okla.
   Greene, 37, of Inola, Okla., and Braun are described as very
similar in appearance. ``They could almost pass for brothers,''
Garden City Police Capt. Stan Wojdylak said.
   District Attorney Fred Collins in Ardmore said he was dismissing
the charges against Greene without prejudice, meaning they could be
refiled at a later time if prosecutors feel they should reopen the
case against Greene.
   Collins cited the preliminary ballistics and fingerprint tests
as well as evidence that Greene had been in a Wichita Falls, Texas,
hospital Friday as reasons for dismissing the charges. He said it
was physically impossible for Greene to have been in Ardmore at the
time of the shootings.
   Collins said he is waiting for the final fingerprint and
ballistics tests before considering charges against Braun.
   Asked Wednesday after charges were filed against Braun if Greene
was still a suspect, Wojdylak said only that ``the scope of the
investigation is not limited to Mr. Braun.'' He said other
possibilities have not been ruled out.
   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon reported Wednesday that
employees of the Grain Bin, a Garden City nightclub, knew both
Greene and Braun, but that there was no immediate indication the
two men knew each other.
   Braun had been a maintenance worker at the S-Bar Ranch Feed Yard
near Garden City. Feed Yard manager Galen Wright said Braun came to
work the day after the Garden City slayings, picked up his paycheck
and said he wouldn't be back.
   Greene had been staying this month at the Wheat Lands Motor Inn
in Garden City but left without paying a $295 bill, motel officials
said.
   Motel officials said they moved his belongings out of his room
July 17, two days before the Garden City killings.
   All five victims were believed to have been shot with a
.25-caliber weapon, and New Mexico authorities found a .25-caliber
handgun in Braun's car when he was arrested Monday. The killings in
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were believed to have been carried out
with the same weapon.
   Ballistics tests have been completed, but New Mexico authorities
said they would not release results until Braun appears in court
next month.
   Wojdylak said evidence gathered by officers in Kansas, Oklahoma
and New Mexico resulted in the arrest warrant associated with the
Garden City charges.
   He would not describe the evidence, but search warrants returned
to Finney County District Court showed that blood-stained jeans and
a shirt were recovered from Braun's Garden City house Monday.
   The warrant on file Wednesday indicated authorities were also
looking for women's clothing, a .25-caliber weapon or ammunition,
cash and coin trays and an identification badge from one of the
Garden City stores.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorneys Convicted 1,067 Public Officials in 1988</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. attorneys won corruption convictions
against 1,067 public officials in 1988, and prosecutors in Chicago
had the best record with 119, the Justice Department said Wednesday.
   ``These totals reflect nearly a three-fold increase in the
average number of corruption convictions obtained annually by
federal prosectors over the course of the past decade,'' Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said.
   They ``demonstrate how dramatic results can be obtained when a
strong emphasis is placed on rooting out corruption,'' he said.
   Federal prosecutors got convictions against 529 federal
officials, 69 state officials, 229 local officials and 240 private
citizens tied to public corruption, Thornburgh said in a report to
Congress.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago had 119 convictions in
1988, followed by 89 in the Eastern District of New York, covering
the Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island boroughs of New York City
and the suburban counties on Long Island, 49 in Massachusetts and
48 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
   The Chicago prosecutors put away aldermen, judges, attorneys and
court officers who took and paid bribes for favors. One
investigation, dubbed Operation Deadfall, snagged corrupt police
officers who accepted money to steer bodies to certain funeral
homes.
   ``There are those who believe that taking bribes is a
gratuity,'' said Anton Valukas, the government's top prosecutor in
Chicago. ``That attitude is amazing. Those who are there are
supposed to be assisting citizens, not looting.''
   Since 1978, the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District
of New York, covering the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and
The Bronx and suburban counties north of the city, has the most
convictions involving public officials, 477. Chicago is second at
412.

<HEAD>Castro Says U.S. Dreams of Hitler's Empire of 1,000 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Castro addressing nation; no pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMAGUEY, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro said Wednesday that
the United States, sensing the demise of socialism, is dreaming of
establishing a ``1,000-year empire,'' as Adolf Hitler did a half
century ago.
   Castro said that although the socialist world _ particularly
Soviet bloc nations _ faces serious difficulties, the United States
will be no more successful in creating a global empire than was
Hitler.
   ``Imperialist circles are dreaming about an empire of 1,000
years, as in his times Adolf Hitler dreamed,'' Castro said,
addressing a crowd of tens of thousands of rain-soaked listeners.
   The Cuban people have overcome difficulties before and can
survive any challenge the United States might pose, be it a war of
attrition, an occupation, an invasion, or a total blockade, Castro
said.
   The occasion for Castro's speech was the 36th anniversary of his
debut as a guerrilla fighter. Cubans packed Camaguey plaza to hear
their revolutionary leader.
   Rain fell during much of his speech, which lasted one hour and
50 minutes and was one of the briefest he has delivered at such a
ceremony.
   Castro was not protected against the rain, and his green
military uniform was soaked through by the time he finished.
   Castro was sharply critical of President Bush, ridiculing his
``triumphant'' attitude concerning difficulties the socialist cause
is now experiencing.
   Castro warned of an American effort to ``recolonialize'' the
world in the event of the complete demise of socialism.
   During Bush's visit to Poland, placards appeared in crowds that
greeted Bush, saying ``The best communist is a dead communist,''
Castro said.
   He described this sentiment as ``fascist'' and said that
socialism's enemies ``should know that we communists won't let
ourselves be killed easily.'' The remark was received with long
applause.
   Castro raised the possibility that his countrymen might someday
wake up and learn that a civil war has broken out in the Soviet
Union or that the country has disintegrated altogether.
   ``In this event, Cuba will continue fighting and will continue
struggling,'' he said.
   He recounted the drift toward capitalism in Poland, reflected in
recent electoral setbacks for Communist Party candidates.
   He suggested that perhaps it would be a good thing for Polish
youth to know how ``egotistical, brutal and inhuman'' capitalistic
societies are.
   It was Castro's first public speech since the execution two
weeks ago of an honored comrade and three other military officers
on corruption charges, but he made no reference to the scandal.
   The speech marked July 26, 1953, when the young Castro led an
attack on a military barracks that launched his long campaign
against dictator Fulgencio Batista, who fled the island on Jan. 1,
1959.
   President Castro uses each anniversary for a major address.
Interest was heightened this year by the trials of the four
high-ranking officers.
   They were convicted of drug smuggling and other offenses in the
biggest corruption scandal of Castro's time in power.
   Among them was Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who was with Castro from the
beginning and was made a Hero of the Revolution for his performance
as a commander of Cuban expeditionary forces in Africa. Lesser
sentences were given to several other officials.
   Except for a speech to the Council of State last month, excerpts
of which have been made public, Castro generally has been silent on
the subject.
   Lower-ranking officials who met with reporters Tuesday, however,
made a favorable comparison between Cuba's record in combatting
drug smugglers with that of the United States.
   Castro, who will be 63 next month, toured the area around
Camaguey on Tuesday, visiting projects built since this
agricultural center 300 miles west of Havana was chosen for this
year's July 26 festivities.

   A tanker rammed the side of a lock on the
St. Lawrence Seaway on Wednesday, spilling up to 3,000 gallons of a
flammable chemical and halting ship traffic for the day, Seaway
officials said.
   The spill, contained inside the lock chamber, did not leak into
the open water of the St. Lawrence River, said Shelley Beaudry, a
Seaway Development Corp. spokeswoman said. There were no injuries
reported.
   The chemical was cleaned up by Wednesday night and the waterway
was to reopen once tests were completed, said Dennis Deuschel, the
corporation's director of communitions. Seven ships were delayed
passing through the Snell Lock because of the spill, he said.
   The Lake Anne, a 569-foot-long tanker owned by Arne Blystad of
Norway and registered in Singapore, hit the lock wall about 5:15
a.m., spilling xylene into the lock area, said Beaudry. Xylene is a
petroleum-based substance often used as a solvent in the paint
industry.
   The accident caused an 18-inch cross-shaped rupture above the
waterline of the tanker. It appeared damage was not serious to the
ship, she said.
   The tanker was en route from Sarnia, Ontario, to Montreal,
Quebec, with a final destination of England, she said. It has a
crew of 27.
   The Snell Lock is about 90 miles downriver of Montreal, near the
border of the United States and Canada.

   An inmate at a mental health center who allegedly
wrote threatening letters to Olivia Newton-John and dozens of other
celebrities could be ordered released at a court hearing next
month, his attorney said.
   The possible release of Ralph Nau was enough to prompt a
prosecutor who handled his murder trial to write warning letters to
40 prominent women with whom Nau has allegedly had imagined
relationships.
   Prominent among Nau's infatuations is actress-singer Olivia
Newton-John, said Randall Stewart, an assistant Lake County state's
attorney. The prosecutor said Nau twice traveled to Australia in
pursuit of Miss Newton-John.
   Attorneys at a hearing Wednesday worked out details on what
evidence can be presented in Kane County Circuit Court in August on
Nau's petition for release from Elgin Mental Health Center.
   Lake County public defender David Brodsky, who represented Nau
at his murder trial, said the hearing could determine whether Nau
is released from the mental health center.
   Nau was acquitted in May of murdering his 8-year-old stepbrother
after the judge refused to allow a purported confession into
evidence. Nau lived in Antioch, where the boy's body was found.
   Stewart said Nau confessed to killing his stepbrother in 1984
and that he wrote hundreds of letters, many of which are clearly
threatening.
   Stewart said Nau believes that Miss Newton-John was killed by an
evil double, and he has threatened to avenge this imagined crime by
killing the supposed impersonator.
   The prosecutor refused to release the names of other celebrities
he had warned, saying they had requested anonymity.
   Stewart said he wrote in his 40 warning letters that ``we
strongly feel he could be a potential threat to you and your
family's safety upon his release.''
   Celebrities have been occasionally threatened by infatuated
fans. Last week, actress Rebecca Schaeffer was shot dead at the
door to her Los Angeles apartment building, allegedly by a man said
to be obsessed with her.
   Brodsky said that although Nau is mentally disturbed, he never
admitted killing anybody and never threatened the life of any stars.
   ``He's written love letters and fan letters, maybe some people
think excessively,'' said Brodsky, who represented Nau in the
murder trial.
   ``He had delusions of grandeur and believed he was famous, but
never threatened anybody,'' Brodsky said.
   The purported confession, he said, was put in his mouth by
police officers during 12 hours of questioning.
   Prosecutors had Nau committed involuntarily to the Elgin Mental
Health Center for a psychiatric evaluation after his murder trial.
   The center is located in Kane County, where his petition for
release is being heard.
   Brodsky declined to speculate on whether Nau would be a threat
to anyone if he is released.
   ``That's impossible to say,'' he said, but added, ``Ralph
deserves to have his rights adjudicated in as fair a manner as
anybody.''

   Convicted murderers sentenced to life
imprisonment in New South Wales will stay in jail until they die,
the state government decided Wednesday.
   ``The community has become cynical about life sentences,'' said
state Premier Nick Greiner. ``The public, and relatives of victims
in particular, are entitled to know that when people are sentenced
to life for murder, they will spend the rest of their natural life
in prison.''
   Greiner said the new law will not be retroactive and those
currently serving life terms will still be eligible for parole,
which is usually granted after 12 years.
   The legislation drew criticism from the Council for Civil
Liberties, which accused the state government of ``pandering to
vindictive elements.''
   Civil Liberties President Ken Horler said the new law offered
little chance of rehabilitation of inmates.

   An explosion ripped through the Kansas Army
Ammunition Plant on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring four
others.
   The cause of the 4:20 p.m. explosion was not immediately known,
said a spokeswoman for Day and Zimmermann Inc., the private
contractor in charge of manufacturing. The plant, which is owned by
the U.S. Army, makes several types of munitions.
   Employees who refused to be identified said the explosion
occurred on a production line where components for cluster bombs
are made. The company would not confirm that the line was the site
of the blast.
   The names of the dead were not immediately released.
   Jerry Lilley, administrator at Labette County Medical Center,
said three people were treated for abrasions and discharged. One
worker was listed in good condition, being treated for abrasions
and shrapnel wounds in his arms, trunk and face.
   Manager Carl Wilson said the 1,400-employee plant stopped
operation Wednesday evening. Most of the plant would resume
operating Thursday morning, the company said.

   A dairy farm worker was overcome by

and four others died trying to rescue him, authorities said.
   ``It appeared they were cleaning it and the first victim just
happened to slip,'' said Dr. Paul Haupt, county medical
examiner.``One man accidentally slipped down the inclined plane; a
second went down in and was overcome also. Then another went down
to get the other two, and so on and so on.''
   One man was dead when deputies arrived at the Elm Brook Farm in
Menominee Township in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, said Menominee

   Three others died later Wednesday morning at Bay Area Medical
Center in Marinette, Wis., and the fifth was pronounced dead at

he said. Menominee is near he Wisconsin-Michigan line.
   The names of the victims, ages 18 to 60, were not released while
relatives were notified.
   Methane is a colorless, odorless gas formed by the decomposition
of vegetable matter.
   The accident occurred in a 6-foot-high unventilated tank with
about 1 foot of manure in the bottom, said Haupt.

<TEXT>
   Residents of a trailer park that the
Environmental Protection Agency says is contaminated with toxic
chemicals expressed outrage Wednesday at talk of a temporary
relocation program.
   ``They're not relocating me,'' said John Morreale, one of the
150 residents of the Forest Glen mobile home park. ``They've got to
buy me out, give me a reasonable price for my property.''
   More than 90 residents showed up at a meeting with federal
officials at a fire station Wednesday night to voice similar
sentiments.
   ``Why can't you declare an emergency like they did in Love Canal
and move us out immediately?'' Robert Barclay asked at the meeting.
   Barclay and others said the amount of monetary assistance the
government was offering was not enough.
   ``My wife and I can't afford it. We're on social security,''
Barclay said.
   Robert Salkie, an EPA official, said the government would rush
the site onto a Superfund priority list and that the families would
be permanently relocated perhaps in as few as two months.
   But residents said that was too long. Terry Friermuth said,
``It's too long to wait. It's too much of a disruption for the
family. You don't realize what you're putting us through.''
   The federal Emergency Management Agency began contacting Forest
Glen residents Tuesday to advise them of the findings and canvass
them about whether they wish to stay or relocate.
   Residents choosing to move temporarily will be provided with
three months' rent by the agency, Gerald Connolly, a senior
Emergency Management representative, said before the meeting.
   The agency will also provide food and utility stipends for
relocating residents and in some cases pay for rental insurance and
the cost of kenneling pets, Connolly said. Paying mortgages on
homes in the Forest Glen neighborhood will remain the
responsibility of the owners, he said.
   The EPA said Tuesday that the discovery of five industrial
chemicals in the soil and groundwater beneath the trailer park's 11
acres posed a significant risk to the health of the 51 families
that live in the neighborhood.
   Authorities think the ground on which the mobile home park was
built may have been used as a chemical dumping ground. The site is
near a hazardous waste landfill and a few miles from Love Canal,
which was declared a national environmental disaster a decade ago
because of extensive chemical contamination.
   A spot check of the residents showed that most were opposed to
temporary removal but would accept permanent relocation if the
government would help pay for it.
   Officials said it is too early to discuss plans for a buyout,
however. They have recommended that the evacuation remain in effect
until the health risk is ``eliminated or substantially mitigated.''
   The contamination may be bad enough to force the eventual
abandonment of the entire neighborhood, said the EPA's Richard
Salkie.
   ``We are talking about temporary relocation, but it seems to me
that the long-range answer is permanent relocation,'' he said.
   Salkie said the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry has agreed to issue a public health advisory, which is a
first step toward placing the community on the national Superfund
priorities list for cleanup and permanently relocating residents.
   The EPA's enforcement division, meanwhile, is investigating who
may have dumped the chemicals in the area, he said.
   Among the chemicals identified so far are aniline,
phenothiazine, benzothiazole and polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
substances officials said are byproducts of industrial processes,
including chemical making.
   Despite health risk from exposure to the chemicals, which are
believed carcinogenic, no illnesses in the mobile home park have
been traced to contamination, officials said.

<HEAD>Teachers Picket, Mail Piles Up as Strike Drags on</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mail piled up and teachers blocked the
streets of the capital on Wednesday, and President Vinicio Cerezo
said he was losing patience with a weeks-old strike by an estimated
50,000 public employees.
   Cerezo reiterated his opposition to giving the strikers, most of
them teachers and postal workers, a raise this year. He told a news
conference the government does not have the money.
   He also said strikers would not get their July paychecks.
   The walkout has been marked by a series of marches and other
demonstrations, including almost daily traffic blockages.
   On Wednesday, strikers blocked most of the main roads into
Guatemala City, and authorities also reported blockages in the
north at border crossings into Mexico.
   Meanwhile, emergency workers sorted air mail and domestic mail
piled up in warehouses.
   The strike has hurt many Guatemalans who rely on money sent by
relatives working in the United States and other countries.
   The U.S. Postal Service this week declared an embargo on mail to
Guatemala because of the strike. Officials in Washington said
Tuesday that the Guatemala postal administration requested the
embargo.
   The strike began May 31 with a slowdown by teachers. By early
June, the nation's 36,000 teachers had walked out, and by mid-June
the 5,000 postal workers had joined in.
   Several smaller groups of government employees have joined the
walkout, which now involves an estimated 50,000 of the government's
200,000 employees.
   Telegraph workers, who struck with postal workers, went back to
work earlier this week after the Communications Ministry agreed to
negotiate a raise next year.
   Cerezo has maintained from the outset that the government cannot
afford a raise and urged workers to wait until next year. He met
personally with the teachers for the first time on Tuesday.
   The strikers want a monthly raise of $80. Teachers and postal
workers now earn from about $125 to $250 per month.
   In a nationwide television address July 19, Cerezo told the
strikers they were being manipulated by the extreme right and the
extreme left and said their demands were unjust. As the speech
began, the transmitting tower of one television station was knocked
off the air by a bomb.

   The government has ignored its own warnings to
improve defenses against spies, the Senate Intelligence Committee
says in a report that comes as embassy security undergoes new
scrutiny in the Felix S. Bloch espionage case.
   In unusually harsh language, the committee said ``bureaucratic
infighting'' has paralyzed the new Security Evaluation Office,
established last year under CIA Director William Webster to bolster
anti-spy efforts at U.S. embassies around the world.
   ``It has failed to achieve its objectives,'' the panel said in
an assessment written before last week's public revelation that
Bloch, once the No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was
under investigation for allegedly passing secrets to the Soviet
Union. Ranking committee members had been informed of the Bloch
case, absent his name, in late June.
   While the report deals mainly with technological efforts to
thwart spying at U.S. posts abroad, it highlights the State
Department's longstanding reputation among intelligence
professionals for giving short shrift to security.

   A survey of cardiac specialists suggests that
as many as 3,000 patients may have died prematurely after taking
heartbeat control drugs that were found to increase risk of sudden
death among some types of patients.
   Dr. Joel Morganroth, professor of medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania, said he estimated the toll after surveying 1,000
cardiologists to learn how many prescribed encainide or flecainide
for patients who had mild heartbeat irregularities after recovering
from a heart attack.
   Morganroth, who also is director of cardiac research at Graduate
Hospital in Philadelphia, said the estimate of 3,000 premature
deaths was a rough number.
   ``Let's call that the worst scenario,'' he said.

diseases might be explained by a radical new finding that not all
genes are created equal: Genes passed on by fathers may be
different from those passed on by mothers.
   Researchers are beginning to accept evidence that began to
appear in the early 1980s suggesting that mothers and fathers each
``imprint'' genes with different signals before passing them on to
their children.
   The findings contradict one of the principles of genetics
established in the last century by Gregor Mendel _ that it made no
difference to a child whether it inherited a genetic trait from its
mother or its father.
   That now seems wrong. Genetic imprinting by mothers and fathers
may be responsible for many kinds of cancer and inherited diseases,
said Dr. Judith Hall of the University of British Columbia in
Canada.

   President Bush hopes tough talk will force
foreign governments to stop subsidizing their domestic steel
industries, but lawmakers in U.S. steel states remain skeptical.
   After months of internal debate in his Cabinet, Bush said
Tuesday he was extending steel-import restrictions for 2{ years.
The steel industry had sought a five-year extension.
   The voluntary import quotas, which cover 29 countries, were due
to expire Sept. 30. They will be extended to March 31, 1992, if
Congress, as expected, agrees.
   Bush said the extension would give U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills time to negotiate an end to unfair steel subsidies
provided by other countries.

   Two PTL aides convicted of tax evasion
harbored no bitterness over ministry founder Jim Bakker's decision
not to testify in their defense, their attorney says.
   Brothers David and James Taggart were convicted Tuesday of
evading $525,000 in income taxes on $1.2 million they took from the
television ministry to buy condominiums, furs, jewelry and nearly
$100,000 worth of shoes.
   Bakker invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination last week when the defense called him to the
stand. Bakker and former PTL Executive Vice President Richard
Dortch are scheduled to go on trial Aug. 28 on wire and mail fraud
and conspiracy charges.
   ``Obviously we would have preferred it if he testified,'' said
defense attorney Ben Cotten.

   In the cramped and cluttered back office
of his wife's video rental store, Bill Anderson surrounds himself
with how-to books on farming during the turn-of-the-century, and
produces the magazine of his dreams.
   ``A lot of people out there like to read about old-time
methods,'' he said, as he showed off his 1885 edition of ``The
American Standard Poultry Book.''
   ``This is the book that turned me on.''
   Anderson's wistful longing for the days when a man could grow
his own food and raise a family with 40 acres and a mule is the
heart of Living Among Nature Daringly magazine, which he edits and
publishes in this small farming town on the northern end of
Oregon's verdant Willamette Valley.
   Printed on newsprint at the local newspaper, LAND is filled with
tips on tanning hides, trapping muskrat, building log cabins,
brewing herbal teas and getting rid of ear mites on rabbits.
   It's a personal project for the 36-year-old Anderson, who shares
with readers his latest battles with his personal computer, and
advice from some of his 3,000 U.S. Department of Agriculture
pamphlets. He dedicates each issue to people he admires, such as
Wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody (``He's a shirt-sleeve
relative''), actor Tom Laughlin (``Billy Jack'') and John
Shuttleworth, who founded Mother Earth News.
   Anderson is trying to re-create the magic he found in those
early issues of Mother Earth News, which became a handbook for the
back-to-the-land movement.
   ``I and other readers of the Mother Earth News felt abandoned
when they started publishing it for yuppies,'' he said. ``It seemed
the slicker it became, the more disgruntled (the early subscribers)
became.
   ``There was nothing for me to read in it anymore and I took a
gamble that others would feel the same way.''
   He launched his venture in 1986 from the kitchen of his mobile
home while living in Oakland, typing and photocopying the first few
issues, and gluing color photographs to the pages when it turned
out they wouldn't reproduce clearly on the photocopier.
   ``They cost $5 an issue to make,'' he said. ``But I only had a
few subscribers, so it didn't break me.''
   He kept it going even when he moved to Cairo, Egypt, on a
construction job, and continued it when he returned to Oregon.
   Last year, he only had 22 paid subscribers when Library Journal
chose it as one of the best new magazines in the country. Using the
membership list from the American Rabbit Breeders Association, and
the addresses of people writing letters to such magazines as
Trapper and Fur-Fish-Game, he increased subscriptions to 220.
   The last issue, the 10th so far, was a run of 5,000 copies,
which Anderson had stuffed in the local newspaper and mailed to
libraries and names he has picked up along the way.
   Advertising is still meager, but increasing. Issue No. 10
contained display ads for wildlife videos, knives, books and Water
Street Books and Videos, his wife, Tesi's, store. It also had
classified ads for such things as armadillo repellent, an
escargot-raising kit, catfish traps, fox pups and a newsletter to
find caretaker positions.
   ``I want the magazine to be a conduit for eye-opening and
heart-opening communication,'' Anderson said. ``We purposely set
the price for the magazine ($2 an issue, $9 a year) to meet the
low- to middle-income group. My personal conviction is the low- to
middle-income group of society is the bedrock of society. Any
grass-roots change of life is there. The environment, the future of
the Earth, depends on them.''
   In choosing topics, he asks himself, ``Is it interesting? Then,
is it useful? Then, is it wholesome? That's about what I look for.''
   Anderson first came to Oregon from Southern California in 1974
looking for the kind of life his father had in Lynwood, Calif.,
before it was absorbed by the urban sprawl around Los Angeles.
   ``He grew up in the ideal we are tring to achieve, the people
who keep their own cow, raise a pig or two and harvest their own
eggs from their own chickens,'' said Anderson.
   ``My goal was always to to have 40 acres. I always wanted to
homestead. By the time I got out of high school, they had closed
the homesteading in Alaska, so I joined the Navy.''
   Like many others who have come to Oregon chasing similar dreams,
Anderson has had a hard time finding it. After trying to raise
Holstein heifers, hogs and rabbits, he is trying to start a small
dairy as he and his wife support themselves with his manufacturing
quality control inspection business and her video rentals.
   ``I call myself a liberationist,'' Anderson said. ``I like to
see people pursue their own dreams.''

   Paul Linke sits for an hour and 18 minutes
and talks about his wife's losing battle with cancer in the HBO
special ``Time Flies When You're Alive.''
   It is a mesmerizing, mind-blowing experience. Linke talks of
hope and despair and love, and it is the latter that binds the
special together and makes the painful moments bearable.
   Francesca Draper Linke, the mother of three children, died in
1986 at the age of 37. The one-man piece, which Linke first
presented on the stage, will be shown on Home Box Office on Sunday.
   As he sat down in a restaurant to discuss the special, Linke was
affected by a rush of emotion.
   ``We had a tradition of pre-Christmas lunches for the whole
family,'' he said. ``The last lunch we had when `Chex' was still
alive in 1985 was in this restaurant and at this same table.''
   Linke, who had not selected the site, paused, then added, ``I
had an inkling it would be her last Christmas. Being here brings it
full circle. That's what I was going to call the show at first,
`Full Circle of Love.'''
   ``Once she had breast cancer and had the mastectomy and started
alternative healing, I told her I thought there was a book in our
experiences,'' he said. His wife refused all conventional means of
treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy.
   It took some time, and some persuasion, before Linke, who has
appeared in movies and in the television series ``CHiPs,'' was
ready to go onto a stage with the story.
   ``I wrote an outline,'' he said. ``As I did I realized I had not
completed her dying. She wanted her ashes scattered on Mount
Shasta. I rented a van and we all went up and scattered her ashes.
After that, I decided I should really go forward with the show.''
   First, he did a short version at a fund-raiser. ``A man in the
audience said later a friend had died of cancer 13 years earlier
and he had never come to grips with it. ... As I performed I saw
that I was tapping into people's hearts and there was a real need
for it. It brings dying out of the closet.''
   Linke is probably best known for his comic relief role of Artie
Grossman on ``CHiPs.''
   The character, Linke said, was like a baseball relief pitcher.
``He's called in late in the game, delivers a few lines and goes.
My part grew.''
   The series casting director had seen Linke in the movie ``Moving
Violations.'' He has another comic role in the movie
``Parenthood,'' but plays a slumlord in the movie pilot for the
upcoming ABC series ``Capital News.''
   A ``CHiPs'' reunion movie is also being planned. Larry Wilcox,
who played one of the officers, purchased the rights to the series.
   ``In all my years in `CHiPs' I got maybe a hundred fan
letters,'' Linke said. ``I wasn't the pubescent girl's fantasy. But
this (one-man show on life, cancer and death) generates so much fan
mail I can't tell you.''

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's new ``Prime Time Live'' promises no
gimmicks, no re-creations, no sensational stories, but it will have
distinct differences from other prime-time news programs: Diane
Sawyer, Sam Donaldson and a studio audience.
   It's been a struggle for TV critics meeting here to get any kind
of handle on the three networks' new newsmagazines. CBS didn't
bring anyone in to discuss the revamping of ``West 57th,'' and the
three stars and producer of NBC's ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow''
spent most of their time fending off questions about their intended
use of ``re-creations.''
   And with all the competition, the news divisions don't want to
reveal formats or planned stories for fear of someone stealing
their brilliant ideas.
   ABC News' ``Prime Time Live'' will premiere Aug. 3. In the
meantime, co-hosts Sawyer and Donaldson described what sounds like
part ``Nightline,'' part ``60 Minutes'' and part ``Donahue.''
   ``We're not going to do just another program in which we have
pieces that have been prepared for months, weeks, long-form,
perfectly shot, perfectly scripted, put together right,'' said
Donaldson, trying to explain what the show isn't ``... We hope that
you'll see some pieces like that on our broadcast. But in addition
to that, you're going to see us do a live broadcast on the topic
and on the subject, so that we are not just putting on another
magazine show.''
   ``And it's a little bit looser format,'' said Sawyer, trying to
explain what it is. ``I mean, apart from the technologies, we all
know that in the end, after the cameras have gone on and the
satellites work and don't work, and the people show up or don't
show up, it has to rest on what you say and what kind of
information you're bringing.''
   Sawyer said that test runs of the show included some on-location
reporting, but also interviews in the studio, ``and some of it did
have some of the components that Ted Koppel (on `Nightline') uses,
done in a slightly different way on our broadcast.''
   ``Or that (David) Brinkley uses,'' said Donaldson.
   ``Or that Brinkley uses,'' agreed Sawyer.
   ``Or that `60 Minutes' uses,'' said Donaldon.
   ``That's right,'' confirmed Sawyer.
   ``Or that `20-20' uses,'' Donaldson added.
   This is not just another newsmagazine?
   No, it isn't.
   One reason is the studio audience. Other news shows have had
audiences, notably Koppel's on-the-road ``Nightline.'' But this is
the first time in recent memory there's been one for a prime-time
news program.
   Donaldson promised he would not become Sam Donahue. ``I'm not
going to run up and down the aisle of the studio audience (asking),
`Sex in the morning? Do you like it?' `Yes.' `Oh, how about you?' ''
   Donaldson said the audience that witnessed the run-throughs
``added energy by its presence.''
   The real heart of the show, however, is the pairing of Sawyer
and Donaldson, though Donaldson argued that is not the case. ``If
we don't have the interesting topics, and if we don't have the wit
to do them in a way that will interest you, we're not going to make
the program.''
   True, Donaldson was hired for the new broadcast before he left
the White House beat earlier this year and no co-host had been
selected. But when Sawyer was hired away from CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
the new ABC newsmagazine became instantly known in the TV community
as ``The Sam and Diane Show.''
   Despite what Donaldson says, the program's success will rest on
the chemistry between its two stars. They will engage in live
banter on the subject of the evening, with Sawyer, once an aide to
President Richard Nixon, on one side and Donaldson, thorn in the
side of the Reagan White House for eight years, on the other.
   Sawyer hinted, however, that those who ascribe assumed political
posiions to the two would be surprised to learn their true
leanings. ``If you're expecting us to square off in some
color-coded political corners, it's really not going to happen that
way.''
   Donaldson has been a fixture in round-table discussions on
``This Week with David Brinkley'' for years, usually squaring off
with conservative columnist George Will.
   ``George Will and I do disagree at least half the time, and
that's fine, two aging, white males slapping each other around
verbally,'' said Donaldson. ``But, I thought to myself, how will
the audience react if I turn to Diane someday, we're talking about
something, and I say, `Diane, that's nonsense. I mean, that's
ridiculous.' Here is this guy beating up on a very elegant, very
classy woman. Well, I got into these tests with her, and I'm going
to tell you something, I'm going to get the sympathy vote.''
   But after 45 minutes of Donaldson's exchanges with the TV
critics, Sawyer got the sympathy. ``I just want you all to remember
that you get to go home after this,'' she said. ``I go back with
him. I mean, I get a little sympathy for this.''

   After converging here late this week, a
convoy of 27 supply-laden trucks called the ``Pastors for Peace''
caravan was scheduled to head for Nicaragua to help meet needs of
its people.
   Driving a pickup truck loaded with items ranging from medical
supplies to musical instruments, the Rev. Robert Holmes of Helena,
Mont., a retired United Methodist minister, said:
   ``It's a cooperative venture and an effort to build bridges with
people we do not believe are in any way a threat to the United
States.''
   The convoy, sponsored by the Interreligious Foundation for
Community Organization, is carrying an estimated $1 million worth
of goods for Nicaraguan people deprived by ravages of civil war and
hurricane.
   The trucks, which began their trip from scattered points in the
country before merging here, was scheduled to reach Managua Aug. 11.
   Doug Colter of Chelsea, N.Y., driver of a truckload of farm
equipment, supplies for craft industry and developing commerical
fishing for El Salvadoran refugees in Nicaragua, said of the convoy:
   ``It makes a statement that there are people in this country who
care about the Nicaraguans' life situation.''

<HEAD>Graham, After British Sweep, Tackles Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   That durable, old American evangelist, Billy Graham, after
packing stadiums of Great Britain for a month, flew into Hungary
this week, proclaiming its religious life at ``a great historical
turning point.''
   He said changes taking place there ``are good for the Hungarian
people'' and ``also good for our world.''
   After his lengthy stay in Britain, preaching to royalty in
Windsor Castle and to multitudes in London's tough East End, he
moved into communist territory, praising its ``new openness'' and
``spirit of creativity.''
   ``I believe our present visit is another sign of this new spirit
of openness and change,'' he said, noting that for the first time
in Eastern Europe he would be preaching in an open-air arena,
Budapest's People's Stadium.
   His meeting there this Saturday night is being sponsored by the
Ecumenical Council of Churches in Hungary and Council of Free
Churches in Hungary, in cooperation with Hungary's Roman Catholic
Bishops Conference.
   Also, for the first time in Eastern Europe, he said an organized
system was being set up for follow-up church nurturing of those who
make decisions to accept Christ.
   Graham, 70, who for 40 years has been setting new evangelistic
records in his worldwide crusades, set another new one in Britain,
from which his services were carried by national television
networks in 30 African countries.
   This added a TV audience estimated at 22 million to 30 million,
including 8.5 million at 15,000 meetings organized by African
churches. It was termed the largest single outreach and biggest
simnultaneous audience in Graham's career.
   In his 13 meetings in Britain, the last one in a rain-drenched
Wembley Stadium, attendance totaled 1.2 million, of which about
80,500 made commitments to Christ.
   On his arrival at Budapest airport, Graham, in a statement
received in New York, applauded removal of trade barriers, opening
to individually owned enterprises, alternate political parties and
other efforts at democratization. But he added:
   ``The issues which face our world are fundamentally moral and
spiritual, and they cannot be satisfied by economic or political
solutions alone.
   ``How tragic it would be if Hungary fell into the same trap as
many in my own country, and gained the whole world, but lost its
soul. Material progress is important, but it can make us forget God
and his will for our lives.
   ``All too often economic progress and expanded freedom have been
accompanied by moral and spiritual decay, leading to a host of
social ills such as alcoholism, drug abuse, disintegration of
families, loneliness, crime and lack of compassion for others.''
   Graham, who has preached directly to more than 100 million
people, more than anyone in history, has several times filled
churches and cathedrals in the Soviet orbit, but not before in his
familiar stadium setting.
   Making his fourth visit to Hungary, he said indications abounded
of revitalized church life _ new buildings, expanded publications,
youth rallies, frequent religious conferences, church-operated
schools.
   ``All these give evidence of a new period of freedom and
opportunity for all the churches of Hungary,'' he said, adding that
churches now are able ``to elect their own leaders and to
evangelize, both within the church and outside the church walls.''
   Citing his meetings over the last 18 months in China, the Soviet
Union, the United States and England, he said:
   ``Wherever we have gone we have found that people are seeking
answers to the deepest spiritual questions of the human heart _
questions like who are we, where did we come from, why are we here,
and where will we go when we die?
   ``I believe that same spiritual hunger is true of many people
here in Hungary also.''
   He noted that the tombstone of communism's founding philosopher,
Karl Marx, in Highgate Cementery in London says: ``The philosophers
have only interpreted the world in vartious ways. The point,
however, is to change it.''
   Graham added: ``Jesus Christ did not come just to interpret the
world, but to change it ... for he alone can change our hearts and
bring us true peace _ peace with God ... and peace with each
other.''
   In Britain, where he had often preached before, Graham said he
detected ``a greater hunger for the simple Gospel of Christ'' than
previously encountered.
   While the Church of England reports that it has closed 926
churches in the past 20 years and demolished 289 more because of
declining congregations, Graham said:
   ``But wherever the evangelical Gospel is being proclaimed, the
church is packed out. People want to hear the Bible.''
   In Budapest, too, he said: ``Hungarian society needs spiritual
and moral renewal. Political changes can give the churches new
opportunities, but only the Holy Spirit can renew them
spiritually.''

   Six hours after Ronald Reagan left the
presidency, he arrived home for an airport ceremony welcoming him
back to California. For the first time in eight years, he was made
to look ridiculous before cameras.
   Reagan's left finger was in a bulky bandage, having been
operated upon a few days earlier. Someone handed him an oversized
replica of the California license plate carrying the words, ``The
Prez.'' He shoved it under his arm while trying to adjust atop his
head an enormous feathery headdress like those worn by the Spartans
of ancient Greece.
   The ex-president was on his own. None of his handlers was with
him. No one had put down strips of tape to show him exactly where
to stand. He looked awkward and silly.
   Now, six months after he left the presidency, a smattering of
historians and political scientists was asked how Reagan will look
in history _ whether he will be remembered as a majestic president
who put his ideology into effect and reversed the New Deal or as an
amiable but ineffective chairman of the board with only a vague
notion of what the government was up to.
   Some of the answers are surprising, and often contradictory.
   ``What he did was to save the presidency,'' offers Philip Rulon,
a historian at the Northern Arizona University who describes
himself as a liberal Democrat and faults Reagan for sweeping
problems under the rug.
   But Reagan took office after a succession of failed
presidencies, Rulon says, and if Reagan had also failed ``we would
have had a crisis in government, a crisis in confidence.''
   Whatever his policy shortcomings, Rulon adds, ``He made people
respect the president again. He was a great Irish wit. He had grace
and style. He is a communicator and a man of integrity and he
preserved the office.''
   Frank Freidel, history professor emeritus at Harvard and the
University of Washington, compares Reagan to Dwight D. Eisenhower,
complimentarily.
   ``Both were total charmers,'' Freidel says. ``Both clung to the
small-town middle America verities. Both were men of principle.
Both were to some extent hands-off presidents.''
   And if the era of warmth with the Russians persists, ``we're
going to hail him as a man who grasped the opportunity when it was
there,'' Freidel says.
   Princeton's Fred Greenstein, whose research caused other
historians to raise their ranking of Eisenhower, sees history
treating Reagan the way it treats the scandal-tarred administration
of Ulysses S. Grant: ``someone who had substantial public support
but left a rather messy legacy.''
   Greenstein developed the theory of a ``hidden hand'' Eisenhower
presidency. He believes Ike purposely made himself appear
out-of-touch while manipulating events backstage.
   ``Will there be a hidden hand Reagan?'' Greenstein asks. ``I
don't think so. With Ike, we didn't get a dozen kiss-and-tell books
and we had nothing like Iran-Contra.''
   Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas, a biographer of Calvin
Coolidge, says Reagan is to be compared to no other president
because ``he tried to lead a peaceful counterrevolution and we have
not had that before.''
   McCoy says Reagan ``is probably getting higher rating than I
think he will when things settle down.
   ``What shall we (ultimately) say? So-so, average, fair.''
   Lewis Gould, a University of Texas historian, compares Reagan to
Coolidge and to Franklin D. Roosevelt. ``Coolidge was strong for
keeping things from being done,'' he says, and so was Reagan.
   At the same time, he says, Reagan had the Roosevelt touch when
it came to communicating with the people.
   Rulon draws an FDR parallel as well. He thinks Reagan modeled
his presidency after Roosevelt. He compares Reagan's Saturday radio
talks to FDR's fireside chats and says, ``He loved to joke and tell
stories, as Roosevelt did.''
   Gould winds up assigning Reagan to ``the middle or lower-middle
ranks'' of presidents _ in company with William Howard Taft,
Coolidge, Gerald R. Ford ``and John F. Kennedy, who is sinking
among historians with almost every passing year.''
   Political scientist Charles Dunn of Clemson University says
``school is still out'' on the Reagan verdict. Much depends upon
how detente and the deficit play out. ``Reagan's reputation
historically will fly upon the wings of Mikhail Gorbachev and
George Bush,'' he says.
   Columbia University historian Henry Graff, pessimistic about the
country's future, thinks Reagan was the last of a kind.
   ``As the new century commences, we're going to remember that
Reagan gave us an Indian summer,'' he says. ``We glimpse a cold,
hard winter coming. ... Reagan will be remembered when all that
stuff comes as the fellow who said, `Hey, let's play a little while
longer.'''

<HEAD>Thinking Short-Term In The American Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Bsiness Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most common criticisms of American
business may also be made of the American family. Both seem to
think short-term, even at the expense of the future.
   This, of course, is a generality with many exceptions. Lots of
companies foresake instant profits in order to fund research that
won't pay off for years. Many families forego today's pleasures for
tomorrow's security.
   Still, a study by a financial planning group reveals a strong
tendency among Americans to dismiss potential problems from their
minds, often because they are forced to by more immediate, pressing
challenges.
   According to a report of the findings:
   _Despite listing saving for retirement as their most important
long-term financial goal, most people do little about it. ``While
concern is high, short-term worries about the mortgage and paying
for college have taken precedence.''
   _The number two financial goal for most Americans is putting
children through college, ``but most have no idea what it will
cost, and harbor unrealistic expectations about how they will pay
for it.''
   _More than one-third of Americans say someone in the family will
need long-term medical care, ``but virtually none have any plans to
pay for it, nor do they seem disposed to plan.''
   Fairly or unfairly, a rap against surveys is that they tend to
generate more suspicion than conviction, especially when results
uncannily coincide with goals of those who conduct or contract for
them. This one may be no exception.
   Conducted by the Gallup Organization for the International
Association for Financial Planning in Atlanta, it suggests strongly
that Americans need professional financial advice.
   One of the findings, as reported by the IAFP, adds to that
feeling, informing recipients that ``financial planners are also
rated far ahead of other professionals in job performance and
qualifications.''
   Still, it has a convincing ring to it, one that conceivably
might be verified in a survey of one's own neighbors or co-workers,
all of whom have been observed to worry about these three areas of
life.
   The three areas _ retirement, education and health _ share other
traits too.
   All are categories of accelerating costs. All have become huge
burdens to business and government as well as to families. And all
three are costs that repeatedly seem to defy solution. Little
wonder that people hide from them!
   The categories, along with housing costs in one form or another,
are among the social challenges for which individuals most often
seek assistance from government or business, from the latter in the
form of employee benefits.
   The responses to coping with long-term medical payments for a
family member seemed especially significant.
   Respondents thought the possibility was quite high _ it rated
3.4 on a scale of 5 _ and said they hoped to pay the bills from the
patient's savings or retirement funds, from insurance and from
Social Security or Medicare.
   Only 11 percent of 1,000 respondents said they would use their
own savings or wages to cover the cost.
   When those who cited insurance coverage were asked if the policy
would specifically provide for long-term care only 15 said yes.
Another 27 said they didn't know.
   According to Robert J. Oberst, the association's treasurer,
people are confused about what their policies will cover. ``Unless
specifically bought for long-term care, most policies will not
cover it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Property owners Seeking Non-traditional Home-selling Methods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Randee and Mark Goldsmith decided to move
to Florida from suburban Detroit they considered listing their home
with a local broker, but paying thousands of dollars in commissions
didn't appeal to them.
   Doing the work themselves, though, proved too overwhelming. The
couple compromised: they'd show their four-bedroom contemporary
colonial while professionals screened potential buyers and handled
advertising for a flat fee. ``We saved about $8,000,'' said Mrs.
Goldsmith, 34, whose home sold five weeks after the couple listed
it last spring, not much below the $164,900 asking price. ``We used
the money to buy furniture for our new house.''
   An increasing number of homeowners, frustrated by escalating
moving expenses and the soft housing market in many parts of the
country, have been turning to alternate methods of selling their
property.
   Some people, like the Goldsmiths, opt for a discount broker or
real estate counselor while others handle everything themselves,
with different degrees of success. Either way, if you want to save
a buck be prepared to work for it.
   ``You can see this trend on the rise more and more each year. I
expect this is a sign of things to come,'' said J.R. Paine, author
of ``The 30 Day Way To Sell Your Home,'' one of several books on
the subject. Paine founded HMS Franchises Inc., a Southfield,
Mich., non-commission service that helped the Goldsmiths sell their
home.
   ``Most people don't want to throw out about 6 percent to 8
percent in commission. Who can afford that today?'' she asked.
   ``It goes even deeper than people just wanting to save,'' said
Jack Andrews, president of Help-U-Sell Inc., a Salt Lake City
discount broker. ``People are getting more involved in what happens
in their lives. You see more self-service gas stations and
automatic teller machines.''
   The trouble with the traditional home-selling system, critics
argue, is that it's usually unfair to most of the participants.
   A seller has to pay a hefty commission, 6 percent on average.
For a home selling for $200,000 that could mean $12,000 in reduced
profits on what often is a person's single biggest investment.
   But the agent who sells the home won't keep all that money. The
pot usually is split several ways, depending on how many agents
helped peddle the property. Since most work on commission, their
cut sometimes barely covers expenses.
   Discount brokers and counseling services, which comprise between
5 percent and 10 percent of all real estate firms, according to the
National Association of Realtors, claim they've been able to lower
the expense of home-selling.
   For instance, Help-U-Sell, a subsidiary of Mutual Benefit Life
Insurance Co. and one of the nation's largest discount brokers with
more than 500 franchises nationwide, says it offers almost the same
service as a traditional broker at a fraction of the cost.
   For a flat fee payable at the closing that usually averages 2.5
percent of a home's selling price _ around $5,000 for a $200,000
home _ Help-U-Sell promises to handle all advertising and marketing
and help buyers obtain financing, among other things.
   Sellers are required to show their own home, although the
company will handle that task too for a fee of around $500.
However, if a seller decides to list in the Multiple Listing
Service they may have to pay a higher commission to the broker who
finds a buyer for them.
   Discount brokers and do-it-yourselfers argue that homeowners are
by far the most qualified to show their home and they reason that
by saving money on commissions they can be more flexible in the
asking price.
   But Norman D. Flynn, who runs Flynn-Baker Inc., a full-service
realtor based in Madison, Wis., said do-it-yourself selling methods
don't always work well in a soft market.
   ``It seems that this is a phemomenon that comes in cycle when
you have a sellers' market, when there's a very limited supply of a
quality product,'' said Flynn, who is also president-elect of the
National Association of Realtors. ``Most sellers want the most
aggressive marketing approach.''
   Flynn said traditional brokers are best equipped to bring in
qualified buyers, largely because they have the most resources.
``You can't just pluck a sign in your yard and hope someone out
there will buy your home.''

   The youth department of the Church of God in
Christ, a predominantly black Pentecostal group, has set its
priority into the next century on fighting drugs and called on
other churches for help.
   The program was launched at the annual convention of the
church's United National Auxiliaries. The denomination claims 3
million members in the United States and some 1.5 million in 44
other countries.
   ``We hope to make an impact across the country,'' said Bishop
Charles Brewer of New Haven, Conn., chairman of the youth
department.
   A drug enforcement agent for east-central states, N. John
Wilder, told the convention, ``Drug addiction is not only a social
problem, it is a spiritual problem,''
   Bishop Floyd Perry of Cleveland said, ``When those who are
addicted leave treatment centers they often go back to drugs, and
we have to change that, we have to stop that.
   ``Treatment is the Bandaid, it only patches up the problem, but
the churches must do the healing...Our 6,000 churches are going to
send a message out about drugs that the real permanent answer is
spiritual faith, and we intend to cross denominational lines with
that message.''

   After converging here late this week, a
convoy of 27 supply-laden trucks called the ``Pastors for Peace''
caravan was scheduled to head for Nicaragua to help meet needs of
its people.
   Driving a pickup truck loaded with items ranging from medical
supplies to musical instruments, the Rev. Robert Holmes of Helena,
Mont., a retired United Methodist minister, said:
   ``It's a cooperative venture and an effort to build bridges with
people we do not believe are in any way a threat to the United

   The convoy, sponsored by the Interreligious Foundation for
Community Organization, is carrying an estimated $1 million worth
of goods for Nicaraguan people deprived by ravages of civil war and
hurricane.
   The trucks, which began their trip from scattered points in the
country before merging here, was scheduled to reach Managua Aug. 11.
   Doug Colter of Chelsea, N. Y., driver of a truckload of farm
equipment, supplies for craft industry and developing commerical
fishing for El Salvadoran refugees in Nicaragua, said of the convoy:
   ``It makes a statement that there are people in this country who
care about the Nicaraguans' life situation.''

<HEAD>Religion Giving At New High, But Much Of It Goes To Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contributions to religion, which far exceed any
other kind of philanthropy in America, rose to $48.21 billion in
1988, up 8.24 percent. But the money doesn't go just for religion
itself.
   Other causes such as health, education and the poor come in for
a big share of it, for which religion usually isn't credited but
which it sees as part of serving God's world.
   Nearly all the religious receipts came from individual
donations. The increase in the total was almost double the year's
inflation rate of 4.78 percent.
   While these figures compiled by the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel show a steady climb of religious giving in the
country, they don't show an intriguing aspect of it.
   This is that the religious recipients themselves give away
nearly half of what's given to them. They're a conduit to various
other causes such as schools, community projects and caring for the
needy.
   The new figures show total American philanthropy last year
passed the $100-billion mark, reaching $104.37 billion, up 6.7
percent from the $97.82 billion the year before.
   That, for comparative purposes, is considerably more than the
$82.6 billion the federal government spent in 1988 for non-defense
goods and services.
   Aside from the sheer bulk of giving, however, the figures don't
show that much of the more than 40 percent slice received by
religion also is passed on to other causes.
   Consequently, while the report shows $9.78 billion going to
education, $9.5 billion going to health and hospitals and $10.49
going to human services, that's not all that these and other social
causes received.
   They also are beneficiaries of religious giving, although this
indirect funding often is disregarded in classifying charities.
   The broader impact was brought out in an extensive study last
year by the Independent Sector of Washington, D.C., and the Gallup
Organization of Princeton, N. J., in cooperation with 100 religious
organizations.
   It found that 54 percent of what religion receives goes to
maintain its own worship and educational institutions, but that the
other 46 percent goes to social programs beyond the church sphere.
   These include soup kitchens, hospitals, colleges, half-way
houses, facilities for the aged and homeless, day-care centers and
a host of voluntary services for communities.
   Based on the ratio determined by the study, religion in 1988
would have put more than $22 billion into various social
improvement causes.
   That's far more than $11 billion combined given in 1988 by
foundations ($6.3 billion) and corporations ($4.7 billion) for such
public purposes.
   On a national and international level, substantial religiously
given funds also are channelled into overseas agriculture
improvement and health projects and also to serving refugees and
promoting peace and racial justice.
   Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, a
non-profit organization of corporate foundations and voluntary
organizations, said the study findings showed religious
congregations ``practice what they preach.''
   However, he said ``many people downplay the significance'' of it.
   In the report of 1988 giving, the fund-raising counsel said
individuals contributed four out of every five donated dollars, a
total of $86.7 billion, while the rest came from foundations,
corporations and bequests.
   Besides amounts that went to religion, education and health,
human services received $10.49 billion, the arts and culture, $6.82
billion, social-benefit causes, $3.02 billion, and overseas
services and recreational associations, $16.53 billion.
   Although the amounts generally were up, charitable giving was
seen as curbed by the 1986 Tax Reform Act which eliminated
charitable deductions for taxpayers who do not itemize deductions.

<HEAD>Opium Growth in Guatemala Has Officials Worried</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opium is the new king of
Guatemala's rugged western mountains.
   The crimson poppy began infecting the area about two years ago,
accompanied by high-powered guns and huge wads of cash. It has
spread like blood down guerrilla-infested slopes and through hidden
valleys, stirring visions of another Colombia.
   U.S. officials say one harvest of 16 metric tons _ and the
fertile region can produce three or four harvests a year _ now
yields enough heroin to supply the needs of U.S. addicts for a year.
   The fight to dethrone the opium poppy, from which heroin is
derived, has become a top U.S. priority here, and worried
Guatemalan officials have agreed to aerial spraying despite the
controversy over the threat to legitimate crops.
   ``I've detected a real sense of panic in some people,'' a U.S.
official said. ``In a small country like this, it wouldn't take the
dopers long to take over.''
   They almost have in the no-man's land where more than 4,000
acres of opium poppies now flourish.
   The U.S. spraying operation was halted in November after only
two months because the low-flying planes were taking so much ground
fire.
   The flights are resuming, but this time with air cover from a
pair of helicopter gunships supplied by the U.S. government and
flown by U.S. pilots under contract, according to U.S. and
Guatemalan officials.
   ``These people live by the poppy. They aren't afraid to kill
anyone,'' said Lt. Col. Eduardo Santis, a Treasury Police spokesman.
   In January, armed growers in the Cuilco Valley region killed six
members of a Treasury Police patrol.
   The 2,100-man Treasury Police force is responsible for drug
enforcement, but Santis said it is undermanned, poorly equipped and
outgunned.
   U.S. officials say the military, which governed Guatemala until
1986 when a shaky civilian government under President Vinicio
Cerezo took over, is staying out of the opium war.
   Officials say the only hope is to make the cost of doing
business too high for the traffickers.
   The United States has doubled its budget for the drug war in
Guatemala this year to $900,000. The spraying program is a key part
of the battle.
   Officials say each of the two planes can spray about 100 acres a
day under ideal conditions. The poppy has a 90-day growing cycle
and officials say only continuous spraying can discourage the
growers.
   Small-scale opium cultivation has always existed in the area,
but officials blame the boom on an influx of Mexican traffickers
and the persuasive power of hard cash in a primitive, isolated area
beyond the reach of central authority.
   U.S. officials say they have detected some signs of
money-laundering but the drug trade does not appear to have
affected the national economy yet.
   U.S. officials also believe that a few of the traffickers have
employed leftist rebels eager to raise cash for arms.
   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Movement, a Marxist
coalition of rebel bands believed to number fewer than 2,000,
controls a small zone in northwestern Guatemala but has lost ground
in recent years.
   U.S. officials said some captured guerrillas have admitted
working with the traffickers, chiefly as providers of muscle for
strongarm tactics.
   There is no stong evidence, however, any extensive involvement
by the guerrillas in the opium trade.
   The Mexican traffickers take the opium gum north to their
refining laboratories in Mexico. They also arm the growers and
teach them how to avoid detection.
   Some growers have begun using raised earthern walls and rolls of
canvas or plastic that can be unfurled to protect the brilliant
opium blossoms from herbicides. Others are growing opium poppies
with in crops like corn.
   Guatemala also has also been invaded from the east by marijuana
growers driven from neighboring Belize and from the south by South
American cocaine traffickers who have begun to find usual Caribbean
smuggling routes too dangerous for them nowadays, officials say.
   Officials estimate the amount of marijuana cultivation in
Guatemala's Peten province has doubled in a year to about 1500
acres.
   As for cocaine, Guatemala, which is halfway between the South
American producers and North American consumers, is a ``golden
bridge,'' said Santis of the Treasury Police.
   It is full of remote private airstrips and it lacks radar
equipment to detect suspicious traffic. Santis said traffickers'
planes can fly into Guatemala virtually undetected.
   Radar is high on the list of things the Treasury Police needs to
fight drug trafficking, but the list is long and basic: water
canteens, machetes, shoes, weapons to replace World War II-vintage
M-1 carbines, and communications equipment.

<HEAD>Actor Max Wright of `ALF' Would Rather Talk About His Garden</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Wright is an actor who'd much rather talk
about the thrills and perils of gardening than his starring role in
NBC's ``ALF.''
   ``I'm passionate about gardening,'' said Wright, a favorite
target of the ill-tempered alien in the hit comedy. ``I didn't know
how therapeutic it was until I started. It's ever-changing because
of the seasons.''
   He talked about attacking snails, of keeping insects at bay, of
the dangers of the hot California sun. ``I have to defend my
delphiniums,'' he said. ``You have to pack lilac roots with ice to
give it the cold it needs.''
   After a while, after talking about his garden tour of England,
Wright can be persuaded to talk about other things.
   ``ALF'' tells the story of the cantankerous intergalactic alien
who lands in the Tanners' garage and stays for dinner. Despite his
behavior and freeloading he endears himself to the Tanners. The
show also stars Anne Schedeen as Kate Tanner and Andrea Elson and
Benji Gregory as the children.
   Wright had worked mostly in the theater and films before he got
into television. He was in such movies as ``All That Jazz,''
``Reds,'' ``The Sting II,'' and in the TV movie ``Playing for
Time'' he played the infamous Joseph Mengele, who performed
experiments on humans at Auschwitz. His last show on Broadway was
``Lunch Hour'' with Gilda Radner.
   ``I came out from New York to do a pilot that wasn't picked
up,'' he said. ``I stayed and made some guest appearances on shows,
then was cast in my first series, `Buffalo Bill.' I was the station
manager who was intimidated by Bill. I'd played that kind of role
before. The guy between a rock and a hard place, who's frazzled and
modest and vulnerable.''
   His character in ``ALF'' has some of those qualities. ``He has
to defend the undefendable. He has to smooth over ALF's gaffes. He
gets hauled up in a cage and ALF hits him with a stick. That makes
me laugh. I come prepared with my stock character, ready to forgive
his appalling behavior.''
   The premise of the show calls for Willie to be at once horrified
by ALF's manners and values and attracted to him as a friend.
   ``He's my pal,'' Wright said. ``I care about him. No matter how
outrageous he is I can keep the bond. It's much easier with ALF
than with Buffalo Bill. You can forgive ALF. It was hard to forgive
Buffalo Bill.''
   Wright grew up in Detroit, where he became a music student at
age 4. By the time he was 5 he was playing the piano on television
and at church meetings.
   ``I also began reciting at an early age,'' he said. ``I have a
good memory. I could recite pages and pages of poetry. I did a play
in the third grade. I got the part because I was the only one in
class who would kiss the girl in the play on the lips.''
   His grandfather was Orval Wright, but he's no kin to Orville or
Wilbur Wright, the inventors of the airplane. His father was George
Herman Wright, named after Babe Ruth.
   ``I went to medical school on a musical scholarship,'' he said.
``I was planning to become a doctor. My first semester I came under
the influence of a drama teacher and began doing play after play. I
liked it. I really liked it. I then switched to Wayne State
University to study drama. Next, I went to the National Theatre
School in Montreal.
   ``After that, I launched my career. I did a season in Michigan,
then went to the Arena Stage in Washington. I never worked as a
waiter, I never drove a taxi. I always worked as an actor. I worked
in repertory theater. Television doesn't compare to that. The
theater was tremendously satisfying. It was magic for me. I worked
with people like Meryl Streep. She was brilliant on the stage, but
she couldn't wait to get into movies.
   ``I did seven Broadway shows in five years. I worked hard and
fast. It took me a long time to get out of the habit of rehearsing
days and working nights.''

   Two decades after the Sharon Tate-LaBianca
murders, the screams of a summer night haunt the memories of '60s
survivors and echo through the legends passed to new generations.
   ``There's no question it is the most famous mass murder in
American history,'' said Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay, who
assisted in prosecuting Charles Manson and three women followers.
``My kids learn about it in school.''
   ``There have been lots worse murders over the years, but nobody
remembers them,'' said Maxwell Keith, the defense lawyer who
represented Leslie Van Houten and finds himself remembered for the
case.
   ``It was a mass media event,'' said Irving Kanarek, Manson's
attorney. ``Manson was on the cover of Life magazine and it just
took off.''
   ``I think it's indelibly etched,'' said attorney Paul
Fitzgerald, who represented Patricia Krenwinkel. ``It's like Loeb
and Leopold, Sam Shepard. People can't remember Jim Jones' name or
Charles Whitman; they're even starting to forget Patty Hearst. But
they'll never forget this one.''
   Why, after 20 years, do people still care? Why do they sign
petitions to keep the Tate murderers behind bars? Why do they tune
in when Manson occasionally gives TV interviews?
   The answer apparently lies in public fascination with Hollywood
stars, cults, drugs and the power of a charismatic leader to turn
clean-cut, all-American kids into murderers.
   The crime also was a coda for the '60s, the dead-end stop sign
for an era of dropouts, hippies, druggies and flower children.
   ``It was some sort of metaphor for the times,'' Fitzgerald says
of the collision of Manson's world and the protected Beverly Hills
sphere of movie stars.
   ``In the beginning, the notoriety of the victims was the fuel
that jettisoned this into outer space,'' he said.
   That fatal night of Aug. 9, 1969, black clad intruders crept
into prestigious Benedict Canyon and, in an explosion of violence,
diverted world attention from killing in Vietnam to the senseless
butchering of a beautiful, pregnant actress, Sharon Tate.
   The murder scene was one of ghoulish horror. Miss Tate, the
26-year-old wife of movie director Roman Polanski, was found
slaughtered along with three friends and a caretaker's guest in a
house where her blood was used to scrawl the word ``Pig'' on the
front door. She had been hanged before she was stabbed to death,
and her full-term fetus, a boy, died with her.
   One of the murdered was Jay Sebring, then Hollywood's premier
hair stylist. Another was Abigail Folger, heiress to the coffee
fortune. Voityck Frykowski, a jet-setting Polish film director, was
a friend of Polanski's. Steven Parent, the 18-year-old friend of
the caretaker, died with them.
   As Los Angeles reeled in shock, the killers struck again a day
later. Wealthy market owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were found
gruesomely slain across town in their Los Feliz home. A carving
fork was left in LaBianca's stomach and bloody scrawlings marked
the scene.
   People locked their doors and bolted windows while the killers
remained at large. Three months later the suspects were caught, and
their leader's name became a synonym for evil: Charles Manson.
   The discovery of the shaggy haired, wild-eyed Manson and his
tribe of slavishly devoted, mostly young women followers living in
a desert commune added a new dimension.
   The rich and famous, it turned out, had been murdered by
children of privilege who left their middle class American homes,
took drugs and came under Manson's spell.
   ``These children who come at you with knives, they're your
children,'' Manson would tell society at large. ``I didn't teach
them. You did. I just tried to help them stand up.''
   Their parents' bewilderment was mirrored across the land as
teen-agers became runaways into a world of drug experimentation and
violence.
   Fresh-faced homecoming princess Leslie Van Houten and rugged
one-time high school athlete Charles ``Tex'' Watson became
murderers for Manson. So did Susan Atkins, a troubled girl who
found a home with Manson's ``Family,'' and Patricia Krenwinkel, a
homely secretary who said Manson made her feel beautiful.
   ``It was a feeling all my life I'd been looking for,'' Miss
Krenwinkel said of life with Manson.
   The Manson Family trials began a public journey into the world
of cults, drugs and murder, presaging an era in which such matters
would become commonplace.
   The trial of Manson and the three women lasted 10{ months and
was perhaps the most chaotic in Los Angeles court history.
   ``It was an experience of enormous importance and fatigue,''
said Fitzgerald, who headed the defense team. ``God, it was an
ordeal! The defendants carving X's on their foreheads, Charlie
jumping at the judge, the girls being dragged out of court,
(attorney Ronald) Hughes disappearing. It was a 24-hour-a-day
ordeal.''
   Hughes, Miss Van Houten's lawyer, vanished just before closing
arguments. His body was found later in a remote mountain area where
he had gone camping and was drowned in a flash flood. Keith was
appointed to finish the case.
   A band of Manson's ragtag followers camped outside the
courthouse daily and shaved their heads to protest the trial.
   After months of claiming innocence, the Manson women abruptly
took the stand during the penalty phase of their trial and
confessed in repulsive detail that they and Watson had killed the
victims. Miss Van Houten was not at the Tate house but admitted
stabbing Mrs. LaBianca, probably after she was dead.
   The women tried to absolve Manson of guilt, but the jury decreed
he was as guilty as they were for ordering the killings, even if he
was not present.
   Manson and the three women were sentenced to death. Watson, who
was tried separately, also received a death sentence. But a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling outlawing the death penalty in 1972 commuted
their sentences to life in prison, and in 1978 they began a
seemingly endless string of parole hearings seeking freedom. None
of them has been given a parole date, and Kay, who represents the
district attorney's office at the hearings, says he sees no
imminent chance of that.

   ``I have always been of the opinion that Manson, Watson, Atkins
and Krenwinkel should never get out,'' he said. ``I was always of
the hope that Van Houten would one day be suitable for parole,
maybe when she was in her 40s.''
   But now that Miss Van Houten is about to turn 40, Kay has
retreated on that position. He says her brief marriage to an
ex-convict in 1982 showed she was still susceptible to influence by
unstable males. ``I think there is a chance for Van Houten, but not
immediately,'' he said recently.
   Fitzgerald, who corresponds with Miss Van Houten, contends she
is completely rehabilitated and criticizes the district attorney's
office for ``dancing to the tune of public opinion.''
   Kay's chief ally is Sharon Tate's mother, Doris, who has
gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures on petitions to keep
the Tate-LaBianca killers behind bars.
   Mrs. Tate formed Parents of Murdered Children, a group that
comforts its members and seeks justice for victims. Recently she
has been lecturing at prisons, telling inmates the unfathomable
sorrow of victims' families.
   ``I am the victims' voice,'' said Mrs. Tate, who is frequently
asked by friends why she does not put it behind her.
   ``How can you go on with your life when you're totally consumed
with this?'' she asks. ``How can your life be the same as it was
before? Never.''
   Like others associated with the case, Mrs. Tate still puzzles
over why it happened.
   ``Something deep down inside of me keeps saying, `Why do human
beings react so violently with no reason, especially in cases like
mine.' ... Why kill people they don't even know?''
   Amazingly, that question remains unanswered.
   Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted the killers and wrote a book on
the case, propounded an elaborate theory called ``Helter Skelter,''
which held that Manson's motive was to foment a race war and that
he was inspired by a Beatles song to begin the siege of killings.
   Kay, who took over the case when Bugliosi left the prosecutor's
office, accepts that theory but recently began to see the killings
as a satanic ritual. Mrs. Tate also ascribes to the satanism theory.
   They recall testimony that Watson, upon entering the Tate home,
declared, ``I am the devil and I'm here to do the devil's work.''
   Daye Shinn, Miss Atkins' attorney, is convinced that drugs _
particularly LSD _ triggered the killings.
   ``How else could anyone believe that Charlie had that much power
to get people to kill?'' he asks. ``It was the mind-expanding drugs
they took, the LSD. ... Drugs screwed up their minds.''
   The women testified they were under the influence of LSD and
other hallucinogens when they killed.
   Fitzgerald, while citing the influence of drugs, believes the
motive was never known to the killers and was a product of Manson's
own slide into paranoia in the summer of 1969.
   ``For reasons known only to him, he became very irrational and
antisocial,'' says Fitzgerald.
   And for reasons known only to the manic mind of Manson, he
decided to send his followers into the night on a mission of murder.

   It has been years since Doris Tate and Roman
Polanski saw each other.
   ``For awhile, I couldn't bear to see him because in my state of
denial I would always expect to see Sharon with him,'' says Mrs.
Tate.
   Twenty years after the nation's most notorious mass murder, the
mother and husband of slain actress Sharon Tate are the most
visible survivors of the gruesome tragedy.
   Mrs. Tate, 64, who says her grief kept her immobilized for 10
years, has emerged as an articulate spokeswoman for victims' rights
and a source of comfort to the grieving.
   ``If they look at me and see that I have gone on for 20 years,
then they feel there is hope,'' she says. Her group, Parents of
Murdered Children, has helped hundreds cope with a child's loss.
   Her husband, Paul, a retired Army colonel, has avoided the
limelight.
   Polanski, 55, a film director and actor, is a fugitive from
justice, having fled to France in 1978 rather than appear for
sentencing after he was convicted of having unlawful intercourse
with a 13-year-old girl.
   Nine years earlier, on Aug. 9, 1969, his 26-year-old wife, 8{
months pregnant, was found murdered along with three friends and a
caretaker's guest. The following night market owners Leno and
Rosemary LaBianca were slain in another gruesome killing.
   Charles Manson and a group of his young disciples were convicted
of the murders.
   Polanski was abroad when his wife and friends were slain.
Devastated by the tragedy, he returned to the horror of suspicions
surrounding him because he had directed ``Rosemary's Baby,'' a film
about devil worship.
   The arrests of the Manson ``Family'' ended that part of his
nightmare. He went on to direct the Academy Award-winning film
``Chinatown'' in 1974.
   Living in Paris after the scandal surrounding his trial, he
directed the stunningly beautiful ``Tess,'' which won critical
acclaim.
   But his fugitive status makes negotiations with Hollywood
studios difficult. His two most recent films _ ``Pirates'' in 1985
and ``Frantic'' in 1987 _ did not do well.
   Polanski won plaudits in France for his interpretation of a man
turned into an insect in the 1988 stage version of Kafka's
``Metamorphosis'' at a Paris theater.
   He is occasionally seen at theater openings or taking
refreshments in a cafe like the chic Fouquet's on the
Champs-Elysees. Friends talk of negotiating his return to the
United States, but so far it is only talk.
   Mrs. Tate's odyssey from grieving mother to outspoken advocate
is a lesson in survival. She credits her Roman Catholic faith with
sustaining her and sees herself as ``a soldier of the Lord.''
   ``Since the victims don't have a voice, we that are left behind
that represent our loved ones must be counted,'' Mrs. Tate says.
   She recently formed an umbrella organization, Cover, to
coordinate some 400 victims' rights groups around California. She
serves on a Department of Corrections advisory board and visits
prisons to tell inmates serving time for lesser crimes the
devastation suffered by survivors of the murdered.
   ``If I can change two of those people before they go on to
murder, then I have saved two victims,'' says Mrs. Tate.
   She also campaigns to keep the Tate-LaBianca murderers in
prison. She attends parole hearings for Charles Manson, Susan
Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles ``Tex'' Watson and for
Leslie Van Houten, who was not involved in the Tate murder but
admitted being at the LaBianca slayings.
   When Miss Van Houten's friends gathered 900 signatures urging
her release, Mrs. Tate gathered 352,000 urging her continued
imprisonment.
   She is adamant that the killers of her daughter remain behind
bars.
   ``When a person has murdered eight people _ I always include the
baby _ then they're untrustworthy to be released into society,''
she says. ``They have proven they cannot live in a normal society.''
   Two decades later, she realizes the murder case will be famous
forever.
   ``It won't go away and that's the reason I feel I've got to do
whatever I can do,'' she says. ``That it won't go away is fine with
me. It affords me an opportunity to do something in my daughter's
name. If there's such a thing as destiny, then this is my plight.''

<HEAD>``Z'' Is All New Except for Name</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan did about everything right on its new, fourth-generation
Z car _ except for the name.
   Something more reflective of the car being a real magnet for
young men might be appropriate. And I'm only counting the youthful
males who turned all the way around in their car seats or pulled
alongside my test car and spent minutes taking in every inch of
this auto.
   There also was the fellow who, evidently buoyed by the sheer
sight of the 300ZX, cheered and raised a clenched fist in
admiration. Believe me, none of these guys was looking at me.
   Ask Nissan if young males are the buyers of the 1990 300ZX and
they'll talk about psychographics _ the mental makeup of buyers _
not just demographics such as age, sex and household income. And
they'll say women are likely buyers, too.
   ``The buyers are auto enthusiasts who want to be noticed,'' said
Nissan spokesman E.C. Mueller. ``They have upper education and
income ... They're professionals wanting to make a statement.''
   Judging from the reaction the bright red test car got, there are
plenty of people who want to make a statement on today's roads. The
question for them is, do you have the $27,000-plus for the 300ZX?
   Make no mistake. The car is well done. It's lower and wider than
its predecessor but has a longer wheelbase. Its 3-liter V-6
produces 222 horsepower and is smooth and powerful, getting the car
up to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds. (There's an even
faster model, a twin-turbo 300ZX, due out this fall that brings
even more horsepower _ 300.)
   The T-bar roof is there, offering the easy option of hardtop or
open roof.
   The optional Nissan Bose sound system was exceptional.
   And the real beauty of the 300ZX was the suspension. It retains
the road-hugging characteristics of a fine sports coupe. Yet it
doesn't jostle riders harshly, as many other sports cars do. It's a
fine blend, a good compromise between comfort and performance.
   As Nissan spokesman Mueller put it, ``On a six- or seven-hour
drive, you don't regret being in the 300ZX.''
   Still, making statements on the road isn't cheap. Like all
upscale sports cars, the 300ZX is pricey, and insurance costs will
be pricey, too.
   This is the fourth major design of the Nissan Z car. It's also
the company's response to critics who in recent years said Nissan
had lost sight of the original Z car image _ that of a fine sports
coupe. In fact, the first Z _ the 1970 240Z that was priced at
$3,526 _ was Motor Trend magazine's Car of the Year.
   Over the years, nearly 1 million Z cars have been sold as the
car evolved, and its name changed as larger engines were added. In
1974, it was renamed the 260Z because of the addition of the
2.6-liter engine, then 280Z in 1975, 280ZX in 1979, and 300ZX in
the 1984 model year.
   Sales of the Z car peaked at 73,101 in calendar 1984, the year
the third generation Z car debuted, then declined each year to just
19,357 in 1988. Nissan attributes some of the decrease to people
waiting until this year for the newly designed Z.
   It comes in two body styles _ a two-seater that was the test car
and a two-plus-two version. Both have rakish, sleek exteriors and
firm, form-fitting front seats.
   Drivers must be ready to drive with their side mirrors, as the
rear hatch lid is so sloping that the rear window is somewhat
small. The lines from the rear window defroster add some
distortion. Also, the side window pillars are thick and large and
make it difficult to see to the right and back.
   Inside the two-seater was a small, indented shelf area in the
midsection behind the seats for storage. Tall items fit well there
but also obstructed the rear view.
   Smaller items fit all the way back, where clearance was least.
The back also had cloth cases for storage of the two T-roof window
parts and straps to buckle them in so they don't slide around.
   The instrument panel had large, easy-to-read numbers and letters
_ no digital gadgets here. But beware of that speedometer that goes
to 160 mph. Nissan decided it could be dangerous to have a car that
might surpass a driver's ability. So there's a fuel cutoff at 148
mph. No burying the speedometer on this car.
   A nice touch was having all the adjustment buttons for the
cruise control embedded in the steering wheel. The cruise couldn't
be activated, however, until a main switch on the dashboard to the
left of the steering wheel was turned on.
   Nissan said competitors include the Toyota Supra, which starts
at more than $22,000, and the Chevrolet Corvette, which starts at
more than $31,000. Over the years, fewer Z car owners are reporting
trouble, according to Consumer Reports magazine. The periodical
ranked the 1984 and 1985 300ZX cars as average, followed by better
than average for the 1986 model and much better than average for
the 1987 model.

   Sitting at the end of the runway the aircraft
seems almost to paw the concrete with impatience, more than 18,000
horsepower cranking four big propellers.
   Indeed, it seems too much power just to get a dozen or so people
and some electronic gear aloft. But this is no ordinary plane.
   The Lockheed P-3 Orion has scored 37 victories over the most
fearsome storms known to man, flying into the teeth of hurricanes
to fathom their secrets.
   The hail and rain dousing the outside of the plane on a recent
stop in Washington are nothing compared to what this craft has seen
in the flights signified by 37 red symbols on its fuselage. The
marks are in the shape that meteorlogists use to record a hurricane
on a weather map.
   A victory for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration research plane is recorded by flying directly into
the storm to record its strength and then returning home safely.
   Gilbert, the record-breaking hurricane devastated Jamaica and
parts of Mexico last summer, yanked the craft up and down and side
to side, but couldn't prevent it from completing the mission.
   ``I was waiting for the one that would pull the wings off,''
recalled navigator Tom Gerish. The plane survived a half-dozen hard
jerks in various directions when it flew from the eye of Gilbert
into the heavy winds of the eye wall. It survived them all.
   The calm eye at the center of Gilbert was only seven miles
across, compared to 30 miles for an average hurricane, Gerish added.
   Hurricane Allen, a year earlier, buffeted the plane with the
strongest wind it has faced, a 203-knot blast, which translates to
about 240 miles per hour.
   Knowing the plane is strong enough to survive such forces
inspires confidence when facing a summer rainstorm over the
Chesapeake Bay, riding along to watch an NOAA research plane in
action.
   The two NOAA Orions are based in Miami, remaining there in the
warm, hurricane-prone months to be on call when needed, and
traveling to other areas for various sorts of research in other
seasons.
   They get lots of riders _ scientists, professors, reporters _
early in the summer, Capt. L.J. Genzlinger said. But by the end of
the year it gets lonely on the 4 a.m. flights looking for storms,
he said.
   The 37 hurricane badges on the plane include a few with their
stylized cloud track backward. Those, Gerish explained, represent
visits to Australia, where hurricane winds careen in the other
direction.
   On this side of the equator hurricane winds whip
counter-clockwise around the center of the storm. South of the
equator they churn the other way.
   In addition, the markings include a couple dozen flag symbols,
representing countries from Denmark to India, Egypt to Japan, where
the craft has conducted research. The Orion even has been been
permitted to fly through normally closed Cuban air space.
   Regardless of the season ``there's always weather out there'' to
be investigated, said flight engineer James DuGranrut.
   The craft has investigated hailstorms in South Dakota,
atmospheric chemistry in New Guinea, monsoons in India and Malaysia
and fishery stocks off the coast of Alaska, among other missions.
   On its flight over the Chesapeake Bay the plane was equipped for
studying cloud physics. Electronic display screens allowed the
scientists to measure and record temperature, wind, water content
of clouds, cloud droplet size, chemical components of the air, and
so forth.
   New Doppler radar allows the plane to measure the movement of
wind and water inside a cloud from a distance, something DuGranrut
appreciates.
   ``Before we had that, we had to fly through the cloud. We'd get
a pretty rough ride sometimes. Remote sensing instruments are
great,'' he said.
   Hurricanes, thunderstorms and many other clouds still must be
attacked directly, though.
   On a recent mission to the Midwest the plane had to fly into
clouds to determine their suitability for rainmaking experiments,
Gerish explained.
   Rainmakers disperse chemicals into clouds in the hope that the
chemical molecules will serve as nuclei for water to condense on,
forming a cloud and leading to rain.
   That will work only if lack of nuclei is the reason it isn't
raining. If there already is plenty of smoke, salt or dust for
water to condense on, adding more chemicals won't help, Gerish
said. So, the Orion flew into clouds to sample the potential nuclei
there.

   In a mission designed to enhance superpower
cooperation, two Soviet MiG fighter jets will be escorted over U.S.
airspace next month on their way to a North American air show.
   ``As far as we know, it will be the first time it's happened,''
said a State Department official familiar with preparations for the
event.
   The plan is for U.S. F-15 fighter jets from Elmendorf Air Force
Base in Alaska to escort their Soviet counterparts over U.S.
territory and then hand them over to escorts from the Canadian Air
Force.
   The Soviets are scheduled to attend Airshow Canada, a trade show
in Abbotsford, British Columbia, near Vancouver, as part of a
contingent that will also include an AN-225, the transport plane
that carries the Soviet space shuttle on its back.
   Final details have yet to be worked out, including the exact
date of the flight and the specific route to be flown, but
officials involved in the planning say they expect it to occur
around Aug. 4.
   The Soviets must file a flight plan three days in advance, said
the State Department official, a specialist in Soviet affairs who
asked not to be identified by name.
   The official said that given recent improvement in U.S.-Soviet
relations, there is little question the plan will go forward.
   ``Everybody feels good about this one,'' the official said.
``It's just part of the loosening, the improvement of relations.''
   Lt. Col. Mike Conley, spokesman for the Alaska Air Command, said
pilots there are used to intercepting Soviet aircraft, but only to
point them in the other direction, away from U.S. airspace.
   Usually, they see reconnaisance aircraft or Soviet BEAR bombers,
but not the MiG fighters, Conley said.
   ``This would be a different experience,'' he said.
   Ron Price, the president of Airshow Canada, said the Soviet
visit is the first such opportunity to view the MiG-29 in North
America.
   ``They've only been seen on a couple of occasions in the Western
world,'' Price said.
   Price, who traveled to the Soviet Union to help arrange the
visit, said the Soviets ``are interested in exchanging rides'' with
U.S. and Canadian fighter pilots, but he wasn't sure that could
take place.
   ``I'd love to do it myself,'' said Price, a real estate
developer who is also a private pilot.
   He pointed out that it is not just the spirit of Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness, that is making the event possible.
   ``They are coming to do business,'' Price said of the Soviets.
   The MiG Fulcrum that will be shown at the trade event is an
advanced fighter that is thought to be comparable to the F-16
Fighting Falcon.
   Airshow Canada, backed by the Canadian government, is being held
at a town that for nearly three decades has hosted an airshow
emphasizing aerobatics. The Canadians are hoping their expanded
aerospace show will become a premier trade event.
   The fighter jet hand-off is being planned amid increasing
cooperation between the U.S. and Soviet military.
   The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J.
Crowe, recently returned from a precedent-setting tour of
once-secret Soviet military installations.
   It was the first formal visit of a U.S. chairman to the Soviet
Union and the latest in a series of high-level visits designed to
dispel distrust between the superpowers. Last July, Crowe hosted
Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, then the Soviet chief of staff, on a
U.S. visit.

<TEXT>
   Smacking on a wad of bubblegum,
12-year-old Kiva Henderson chats excitedly about the Boys and Girls
Club of Annapolis Bywater, which operates practically at the front
door of her home. ``They help you with your homework here. It
helped to bring up my grades,'' she says.
   Eleven-year-old Keith Collins chimes in, ``I like it because
it's a good way to stay off the streets. We can't get into trouble
here.''
   While the non-profit Boys Clubs of America has some 1,100
affiliates nationwide, the Annapolis club is one of 76 now located
in public housing projects in an effort to keep disadvantaged kids
from using drugs or dropping out.
   The organization hopes to expand that effort over the next five
years to reach an additional 700,000 disadvantaged children through
300 more such strategically located clubs.
   The clubs organize sports, trips and other activities to build
youngsters' confidence and teach good work habits, teamwork,
honesty and self-reliance.
   Robbie Callaway, the organization's government liaison, says the
first Boys Club at a public housing project was established in East
St. Louis, Ill., in 1953. But he said the national office
``re-energized'' its efforts 3{ years ago because of concerns about
increasing drug abuse and crime by youngsters.
   ``Public housing was identified as the greatest need because no
one else was doing anything there,'' he says.
   Samuel R. Pierce Jr., Housing and Urban Development secretary
under President Reagan, lent his name and influence to the effort.
But no government money was forthcoming from HUD, which is now
under investigation for doling out millions of dollars to projects
backed by prominent Republicans during Pierce's tenure.
   Still, Callaway said, Pierce's public statements of support
caused the organization to be ``swamped with requests'' that led to
the opening of 23 public housing clubs in 1987 and 1988.
   Now, Boys Club officials are looking to new HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp to make a financial commitment.
   Speaking at an April 10 press briefing at the White House, Kemp,
a former Boys Club member and later pro football player, said:
   ``I don't know if there are subsidies for football fields but if
I can find public monies in HUD to support the Boys Clubs and Girls
Clubs of America going into these public housing projects and
setting up athletic teams, I'm convinced that that would have a
significant impact upon putting an end to this scourge of drug
trafficking.''
   To bolster claims of decreased crime with Boys Clubs programs,
officials point to preliminary findings of a three-year study of
clubs in Albany and Binghamton, N.Y.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Peoria
and Rockford, Ill.; Meridian, Miss.; Houston and Brownsville,
Texas; and Martinez, Upland and San Jose, Calif.
   The report's evaluators from Columbia University and the
American Health Foundation said ``substance abuse problems and
juvenile delinquency have decreased in frequency and in severity
within housing projects served by a Boys and Girls Club.''
   Other evidence is anecdotal.
   Ken Darden, director of the Annapolis club, says about six club
members who recently graduated from high school had previously been
``borderline'' students.
   Boys Clubs officials boast that a tough public housing project
in Houston, the Oxford Place Housing Development, already has
experienced a decrease in crime, particularly vandalism.
   At Wilkinson Terrace in Shreveport, La., 10 weeks after opening
a club, officials reported little vandalism at the project as well
as at the nearby mall. The Louisiana results were cited in last
year's report of the White House Conference for a Drug Free America.
   Perfecto Villarreal, head of the Housing Authority of Contra
Costa County, Calif., says a fieldhouse adjacent to one local
housing unit is no longer the target of vandals since a club was
established there.
   ``The fieldhouse itself used to be vandalized,'' he says. ``Now
it is respected.''
   Callaway adds, ``We find that school attendance increases. ...
Also it increases the level of participation of parents and tenant
association in the local school activity, which is a side benefit
we could not have planned for.''
   A key problem is finding start-up money.
   ``Some people don't want to gamble on putting a program in
public housing,'' Callaway says. ``That's what we're finding with
local businesses and local citizens.
   ``Once we're started, though, once we give initial seed money,
it's like giving them a good housekeeping seal of approval and then
the local sector is willing to keep the club going,'' he says.
   Funding from HUD would be a big boost, Callaway says, noting
that the total cost of operating the national organization and its
affiliated clubs exceeded $219 million last year.
   So far, he says, the Justice Department has contributed
$350,000, ACTION agencies have given $362,000, and the Department
of Health and Human Services's substance abuse prevention office
has donated $450,000.
   The average cost to operate a local club on public housing
property is about $55,000, Callaway says.
   The national office works with clubs to find local support to
ensure the program's viability after the seed money dries up.
   `'We do not want, nor do we expect, nor will we allow a Boys and
Girls Club to operate solely on government money,'' Callaway says.
   Boys Club members pay yearly dues from $1 to $5. Youths unable
to pay usually can work off the fee with chores around the
clubhouse.
   The Annapolis club celebrates its first anniversary in September.
   ``The kids don't like to call this a project,'' says Darden, who
was a Boys Club member in Bronx, N.Y. ``They call it a co-op. But
the kids here span the whole spectrum of society, including coming
from low-income or single-parent families and environments of drug
abuse.
   Last September 50 kids joined and now the club has a membership
of 200.
   Robert Randall, 14, breaks away from an intense pool game to
offer his endorsement:
   ``There nothing I don't like about it. We get to play games, go
on trips, and it keeps you out of trouble.''

<TEXT>
   Charles Manson, the most famous inmate in the
California prison system, lives in solitary confinement, subject to
threats by prisoners who want the glory of killing him.
   At 54, the one-time wild-eyed guru of a murderous communal
``family'' still gets stacks of mail and requests for interviews.
Lately he's been declining, because ``he says he doesn't want to
give away anything for free,'' says Evelyn Mazon, spokeswoman for
the high security state prison at Corcoran, where Manson was moved
early this year.
   The three giggly, long-haired young women who once followed
Manson's commands to murder have drifted into middle age behind
bars. Patricia Krenwinkel, 42, Susan Atkins, 41, and Leslie Van
Houten, who turns 40 this summer, appear regularly at parole
hearings seeking freedom that seems more elusive each year.
   Manson's chief lieutenant, Charles ``Tex'' Watson, is a
Christian minister and father of three children through conjugal
visits with his wife at the California Men's Colony at San Luis
Obispo. Miss Atkins also is married.
   Twenty years after the Sharon Tate-LaBianca murders, the Manson
Family killers have settled into prison life. Most are model
prisoners, but only one, Leslie Van Houten, seems a possible
candidate for parole.
   Miss Van Houten, who was not at the Tate home but admitted
stabbing Rosemary LaBianca, perhaps after she was dead, was the
youngest of those convicted. Her first conviction was reversed, her
second trial ended with a hung jury, her third resulted in another
conviction.
   Will any of them ever be released?
   ``Manson will never get out,'' says Paul Fitzgerald, the lead
defense attorney who represented Miss Krenwinkel. ``He doesn't want
to get out. He's perfectly adjusted to where he is.
   ``The girls, I think, will be released eventually,'' he says.
``I think Leslie will get out first, Patricia second, then probably
Susan.''
   ``They have been rehabilitated,'' he says. ``I don't think the
public safety argument is a good argument anymore. Now it's simply
vengeance.''
   Daye Shinn, who defended Miss Atkins, has a different view.
   ``People may say I'm crazy, but I believe the first one to get
out will be Charlie Manson, because he didn't do any of the
killings.''
   According to testimony, Manson sent his followers to Miss Tate's
home on Aug. 9, 1969, and the next night accompanied them to the
LaBianca house but left before the killing began.
   Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay is committed to keeping
Manson locked up for the rest of his life. Except for Miss Van
Houten, he says the killers have little hope of parole. Miss Tate's
mother, Doris, has gathered thousands of signatures on petitions
urging that the killers never be released.
   Other members of the communal Manson Family have scattered.
   Somewhere in America, Michael Manson, the cult leader's son, has
turned 21. In New England, Linda Kasabian, the star witness of the
Manson trial, has raised her children to adulthood. Susan Atkins'
son grew up with an adoptive family.
   Bruce Davis and Robert Beausoleil, convicted with Manson in the
murder of Malibu musician Gary Hinman, are imprisoned at San Luis
Obispo.
   Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who aimed a gun at President Ford in
Sacramento, Calif., is serving a life term at a federal prison in
Florida where she was moved after a brief escape from her quarters
at Alderson, W.Va.
   Sandra Good, who was in federal prison for writing threatening
letters to business executives, is free on parole, as is Steve
Grogan, convicted in the Manson-ordered murder of stuntman Donald
``Shorty'' Shea.
   The Manson trial defense attorneys continue to practice law in
Los Angeles.
   Manson's lawyer, Irving Kanarek, contends the cult leader was a
victim of bad publicity.
   Shinn regrets Miss Atkins wouldn't plead diminished capacity.
Manson ordered his followers to present no defense and they obeyed.
   ``The defendants were naive kids, products of the times,'' said
Fitzgerald. ``Most of them had no arrest records. Yet the public
loathes and detests them and sees them as some symbol of evil. .. .
They were the perfect symbols of innocence, young girls.''
   In 20 years, he said, he has heard no public expressions of
sympathy for these daughters of middle class American families.
   ``People don't say, `There but for the grace of God goes my
daughter,''' he said. ``I haven't heard that once.''

   Orders for big-ticket factory goods rose a
modest 0.3 percent in June, the government said in a report seen as
evidence that manufacturing, although sluggish, isn't crumbling.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday orders for durable goods _
items ranging from bicycles to battleships _ advanced to a
seasonally adjusted $124.1 billion last month. That followed a 4.4
percent decline in May, the sharpest in 10 months.
   ``This is basically in line with the forecast of modest growth
but no recession,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a

   The capital-gains tax cut favored by a
majority of the House Ways and Means Committee is tilted more
toward high-income Americans than the one recommended by President
Bush, congressional economists said.
   Eighty cents of every dollar of benefit in the cut would go to
those with incomes above $100,000 a year, according to the staff of
the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   Bush's proposal would earmark slightly less _ 79.7 cents of
every dollar _ for the over-$100,000 group. It would give 2.5
percent of the total tax relief to those with incomes under $30,000
a year, compared with 1.8 percent under the bill being debated in
Ways and Means.

<HEAD>Earnings Rise 22 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. says it second-quarter profit
increased 22 percent primarily because of higher sales and lower
research and development costs.
   The aerospace manufacturer said Tuesday it earned $195 million,
or 85 cents per share, on sales of $5.07 billion in the period
ending June 30. That compares to second-quarter 1988 earnings of
$160 million, or 70 cents per share, on sales of $4.73 billion.
   For the first half of 1989, earnings were $356 million, or $1.55
per share, on sales of $9.07 billion, compared with $296 million,
or $1.29 per share, on sales of $8.37 billion in the same period
last year.
   Boeing attributed the increase to the 7.2 percent quarterly
sales rise, research and development cost cuts, and other new
business expenditures related to commercial aircraft and computing.
   Commercial aircraft orders set a quarterly record, with 22
customers announcing orders for 502 jets and 8 de Havilland Dash 8
commuter aircraft, valued at $25 billion. The comparable figure in
second quarter 1988 was $13.3 billion.
   The gains were offset somewhat by performance problems on U.S.
government developmental and production programs; increased
research and development and other new business expenditures
related to electronics, defense and space programs; and higher
federal taxes.
   Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz said the company still is
experiencing ``serious work force skill dilution problems'' because
of production rate increases on the firm's 737, 747, 757 and 767
production lines.
   Although a revised 747-400 delivery schedule was met through
June, the company faces ``substantial risk'' in ``being able to
produce and deliver on time all the airplanes we're committed to,''
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said.
   The new schedule calls for more than 60 percent of the remaining
44 747-400 aircraft in 1989 scheduled for delivery in the last
quarter.
   Boeing is not revising the new 747-400 schedule now, Binder said.
   The company delivered 174 airplanes in the first six months of
1989, compared to 169 airplanes in the first half of 1988. Current
schedules call for the delivery of 220 airplanes the rest of the
year.
   Total firm backlog orders at June 30 were $67.7 billion,
compared with $53.6 billion at the same time last year.

<HEAD>Exxon Said It Will Return Next Year, But Won't Commit To Resuming
Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. says it will return to the site of
the nation's worst oil spill next year but stopped short of making
a commitment to further cleanup.
   A July 19 internal memo to Exxon oil spill managers, which was
quoted in media reports Monday, suggested that the oil company's
cleanup crews would leave Alaska for good after shutting down for
the winter.
   But at a hastily called news conference Tuesday in Valdez,
Alaska, Otto Harrison, general manager for Exxon Valdez operations
in Alaska, said that the memo was not intended to ``extend to any
other phase of our cleanup operations.''
   The news conference was relayed by satellite to New York.
   The memo said that the company would demobilize cleanup
operations for the winter ``for safety and operational reasons.''
   But it went on to say that ``all equipment will be fully
demobilized'' and that ``our only commitment for the spring of 1990
is to survey the shorelines.''
   Exxon made the document public Tuesday.
   During the winter the company plans to conduct scientific
studies in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, he said. A
survey team consisting of about 20 people will return to Alaska in
the spring, he added, but declined to say whether the company would
mobilize another massive effort to resume the cleanup.
   ``We'll be here to determine what the condition is and we'll
make our decision at that time in consultation with the federal
government,'' Harrison said. ``I can't speculate on cleanup in the
spring until we make that determination,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard has said that the cleanup is only one-third
complete and state officials and environmentalists have criticized
Exxon for suggesting that it could finish the work by its
self-imposed Sept. 15 deadline.
   Nevertheless, Harrison insisted that the cleanup operation would
be completed by the deadline.
   ``By the end of this cleanup season we will have the shorelines
environmentally stable,'' Harrison said.
   Asked if that meant clean, Harrison said, ``What I'm talking
about is having shoreline conditions so that it does not harm
otters, seals, birds and the normal flora and fauna that inhabit
the area.''
   Harrison suggested that Exxon might remain beyond the September
deadline.
   ``We'll work until wintertime weather shuts us in,'' Harrison
said. ``We think that's about Sept. 15.''
   He said studies under way are analyzing weather conditions into
the fall and that the company may change the September date based
on the findings.
   Exxon spokesman Jim Morakis in New York said the company had
rented warehouse space in Alaska to store cleanup machinery and
equipment over the winter.
   Exxon said Monday that it charged $880 million against
first-half earnings for out-of-pocket costs associated with the
spill. The company also said $400 million from insurance policies
will help with the cleanup and other spill-related claims, bringing
the total spill costs to more than $1.25 billion, excluding
lawsuits.
   Meanwhile Tuesday in Washington, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner defended Exxon's plans to stop the cleanup Sept. 15, saying
the company is living up to its obligations.
   The secretary, who oversees the Coast Guard and was put in
charge of the cleanup by President Bush, also said it doesn't
trouble him that Exxon will not commmit to doing work next year
before it assesses the need for additional cleanup next spring.
   But a spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Exxon's
obligation does not end in September. And Alaska's governor said he
expected Exxon to fulfill a promise to ``stay until the job was
done.''
   The Exxon tanker Exxon Valdez crashed into a charted reef on
March 24 and spewed millions of gallons of oil into Prince William
Sound, fouling hundreds of miles of beaches and killing numerous
wildlife.

<HEAD>USDA Announces Details of Program Reimbursing Apple Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has announced the
operating details of a $15 million bailout to help apple growers
recover from the Alar scare.
   Officials announced the program on July 7 to help move some of
the huge apple supply from the market into donation channels.
   ``USDA is not purchasing apples for distribution, but is
reimbursing the industry up to $15 million once they remove
supplies from normal channels of trade,'' said Kenneth C. Clayton,
acting administrator of the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service.
   Clayton added Tuesday in a statement: ``Payments will be made
for 1988-crop apples donated to organizations that request them, or
for apples used in the manufacture of ethanol (fuel-grade alcohol)
and livestock feed, or dispersed through other USDA-approved,
non-traditional outlets.''
   He said the apple industry will be responsible for distribution
to organizations that request the surplus apples.
   In Washington state, spokesman Chuck St. John of the Washington
Apple Commission said organizations interested in receiving apples
should contact the Wenatchee, Wash.-based commission.
   Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., whose district includes the nation's
leading apple-producing region, said the plan was welcome but late.
   ``We've lost vital time waiting for the plan to be worked out,''
Morrison said. ``It's far from perfect, but I'm pleased we now have
a mechanism that will help clear the pipeline of 1988 apples before
the 1989 crop is ready to harvest.''
   Apple prices fell sharply after the Alar controversy began in
late February when a private environmental advocacy group said
eating apples treated with the chemical Alar substantially
increases the risk of cancer.
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration disputed the group's report as a major exaggeration
of the risk, but sales dropped. Alar is used to enhance apple
color, make harvesting easier and to extend storage life.
   Apples for donation will be allowed to contain traces of Alar,
which currently is permitted on crops at the rate of 20 parts per
million. The EPA plans to ban the use of Alar next spring and in
the interim has proposed reducing the allowable limit to one part
per million.
   Clayton said an inspector authorized or licensed by USDA must
inspect and certify the quality, size, condition and amount or
weight of the apples to removed from the marketplace.
   The assistance program will be available in any state where
apples are available from the 1988 crop, he said. The agency will
accept applications until Aug. 2 and will decide by Aug. 8 who can
participate in the program.
   ``I'm concerned with the amount of time before apples will
actually be distributed,'' Morrison said. ``The apple industry is
now forced to react quickly and creatively to make this program
work.''

<HEAD>Commerce Official Lukewarm On Funding For HDTV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-level Commerce Department official has
given lukewarm approval to a plan by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings to
pump hundreds of millions of dollars into developing new American
technologies such as high-definition television.
   Deputy Secretary of Commerce Thomas J. Murrin said Tuesday that
while he supported the principle of encouraging U.S. industry to
rapidly commercialize new technologies, he wasn't sure Hollings,
D-S.C., was adopting the right approach with a plan to spend $305
million on the department's new Technology Administration.
   The Hollings proposal essentially would double the $159 million
appropriated in fiscal 1989 for the Commerce Department's National
Institute of Standards and Technology, and it includes $50 million
in loan guarantees to spur private research and development in such
areas as advanced television.
   ``We do have several concerns about particular provisions in
this proposal, including the loan guarantee plan,'' Murrin told the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   ``We have progressed to the point where we agree with the
purposes behind these programs, but there may be more
cost-effective alternatives by which we could achieve the same
objectives,'' Murrin said. ``We have to make choices about which
programs would be most important, and what level of support would
provide us with a critical mass to ensure success.''
   Murrin is a longtime executive at Westinghouse who assumed his
Commerce post only a month ago. He said Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher had asked him to head the department's role in addressing
technology competitiveness issues such as high-definition
television.
   He said he considered it ``crucial'' that the United States
develop HDTV, which would use semiconductors and other advanced
technology to generate high-quality images. Proponents say HDTV
could revitalize a sagging U.S. consumer electronics industry and
have important military, medical, educational applications.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., suggested that if HDTV is so
important, ``maybe we need to put our money where our mouth is''
and that perhaps it needs ``presidential attention, just not the
secretary of Commerce.''
   Congress is considering ways to help a fledgling U.S. HDTV
industry overtake the big lead that Japan and Europe already have
in this area. Congress asked Mosbacher earlier this year to
recommend quickly ways the government might build a U.S. industrial
policy on advanced electronics.
   But Murrin said it would be ``some weeks'' before a report was
forthcoming because expert consultants could not agree on what time
frame to establish for development complicated new technologies.
   Murrin noted that President Bush has proposed that new
technology be spurred by a reduction in the capital gains tax; a
permanent research and development tax credit; and changes in
antitrust laws to encourage joint R&amp;D and production ventures.
   The Hollings bill, the Technology Administration Authorization
Act of 1989, would authorize fiscal 1990 appropriations for the
Technology Administration, which includes the National Institute of
Standards and Technology.
   Among other things, the bill authorizes funds for NIST's
in-house laboratory programs, its technology extension activities
and loan guarantees to raise $50 million in seed money for
industry-led projects in areas such as advanced electronics and
television, superconductivity; manufacturing and X-ray lithography,
a new method of making semiconductor chips.
   The $305 million for the Technology Administration would be
combined with $15.5 million already authorized in the 1988 Omnibus
Trade Act.
   The bill would exclude foreign companies, which Murrin said may
not be in America's best interests. He said he favored considering
foreign companies' requests to join R&amp;D consortia on a case-by-case
basis.

<HEAD>Retailer to Promote Philippine Merchandise in National Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. is planning the
biggest-ever promotion of Philippine merchandise outside that
nation, hoping that apparel in bright-colored batiks and tropical
prints plus other items will not only be eye-catching but
customer-catching.
   The two-week Festival of the Philippines in May might even
feature an in-store appearance by Philippine President Corazon
Aquino.
   The promotion, being produced in cooperation with the Philippine
Ministries of Trade and Tourism, could help give the Pacific island
nation a higher profile in the United States that would benefit its
tourism and manufacturing industries.
   David F. Miller, vice chairman and chief operating officer of
J.C. Penney stores and its catalogue, said the promotion at the
1,400 Penney department stores nationwide would be the largest ever
featuring Philippine merchandise outside that country.
   Penney plans to present details of its plans, which will include
Philippines cultural exhibits and other special events, at a news
conference today in Dallas.
   The Philippines has been a source of goods for Penney's for some
time, accounting for more than $50 million a year of its $15
billion in overall retail sales. With the promotion, Penney's could
sell an additional $50 million to $70 million of Philippines-made
merchandise.
   The company said its consumer research shows Americans are very
receptive to the Philippine culture.
   Penney, which will support the May 13-26 promotion with
television and print advertising, will launch the festivities at
its Dallas corporate headquarters and at five stores in cities
chosen for their large Philippine populations.
   Miller said in a telephone interview that the Festival of the
Philippines _ the fourth country-oriented sales campaign Penney has
run _ will give Penney a merchandising focus and some pizazz to
catch customers' attention.
   ``Stores can get to be so humdrum if they offer the same
assortment, the same merchandise,'' Miller said. ``Stores tend to
look alike and their assortments tend to look alike.
   ``We expect double-digit sales gains during the weeks of those
promotions,'' he said.
   Many retailers, including Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus, have
built selling strategies around countries or regions, but Penney is
believed to be making the most ambitious attempt to capitalize on
the approach.
   The tactic usually has been used by upscale department stores
catering to the tastes of cosmopolitan consumers.
   In using the technique to appeal to its more middle-income
customers, Penney has an opportunity to present itself in a
slightly different light and stand out from the pack of competing
department store chains.
   ``If you walked into Bloomingdale's and saw this, you wouldn't
get all that excited about it. For Penney's, it's different,'' said
Norman McMillan of the retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle.
``It's unexpected for them to do something international. Penney
has a thoroughly American reputation.''
   Penney's three past country promotions featured merchandise from
Italy, Britain and India.
   Penney managed something of a publicity coup with its British
promotion. The Prince and Princess of Wales visited its
Springfield, Va., store to help launch the Best of Britain
promotion in October 1985.
   Despite the royal seal of approval, the Best of Britain wasn't a
king-size success at every Penney store. The somber British tones
and heavy woolens didn't play well in parts of the South, for
instance.
   The Indian promotion, held in 1988, was considered highly
successful by the retailer, with sales from it approaching $100
million. It was featured in virtually every Penney store whereas
the earlier British and Italian ones weren't in all the smaller
stores and the catalogue.
   Penney wouldn't disclose how much it will spend to pitch the
Philippines but Miller said the promotional budget alone topped $10
million.

   Continued strong truck sales in mid-July offset
sluggish car sales during the period as the U.S. industry posted a
2.4 percent increase in vehicle sales over the same period last
year.
   The eight major companies making cars and trucks in the United
States reported Tuesday they sold vehicles at a daily rate of
39,726 during the July 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate
of 38,807 during the same time last year.
   Light truck sales rose 3.8 percent during the period while car
sales went up a modest 1.5 percent. Among the Big Three automakers,
car sales dropped 4.2 percent while light truck sales rose 3.7
percent.
   But analysts wondered how long and how strong the truck market
actually was.
   So far this year, car and truck sales among all the companies
were running 4 percent below last year's levels, with car sales
slipping 5.3 percent and truck sales dropping by 1.8 percent.
   ``The truck market has held up better than the car market,''
said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York. ``If
you go back five or six months, I don't think there is any question
that the market has slowed down from a momentum point of view.''
   Kirnan and Tom Webb, senior economist with the National
Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va., agreed that the
truck market as a whole probably will shrink in the near future,
but the minivan segment of it likely will grow and the
sport-utility segment will stay about the same.
   That spells trouble for pickups, which have been the
best-selling vehicles in the past several years in the United
States.
   ``Pickups will continue to slow down where the economy is
slowing down,'' Kirnan said. ``That's going to reduce the
commercial demand for those types of vehicles.''
   Over the past several years, the truck market has shown solid
growth, mostly because of minivans, which are considered trucks but
blur the distinction between cars and full-size vans, and
sport-utility vehicles, including Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep line.
   On Tuesday, Chrysler again reported that its trucks outsold its
cars. So far this year, Chrysler has sold 550,745 trucks and
530,607 cars. The ratios at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
favor cars way over trucks.
   Chrysler's car sales came in 18.5 percent lower in mid-July
compared with a year ago, while its truck sales rose 4.1 percent.
Ford suffered a 2.4 percent decline in mid-July car sales and
posted a 4.2 percent gain in truck sales. GM said its car sales
during the period fell 1.4 percent and truck sales rose 3.1 percent.
   ``The industry has settled in at a lower level here than '88 on
average,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
of New York. ``It's stopped falling off the cliff; it's stopped its
free-fall.''
   Through the first 20 days of the month, cars and trucks sold at
a rate 5 percent above last year's.
   Sales typically flatten in the third quarter as manufacturers
shut plants to retool for the coming model year, which begins every
Oct. 1, and as they sell the last of the current model year's cars.
   This year, automakers have offered incentives and there has been
widespread speculation of price increases for 1990 models, both of
which can fuel sales late in the model year.
   Kirnan wondered whether some of the sales reported this month
are being ``borrowed'' from later on in the year, as consumers take
advantage of incentives now and avoid price increases later.
   ``I'm more convinced that the sales numbers that we are seeing
in the last 20 days in July are probably coming at the expense of
the fourth quarter and the first quarter (of 1990),'' he said.

   Here are the sales results for the eight major
automakers with U.S. plants for the second period of July 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year.
   For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 16
selling days this year and 16 selling days last year, and for the
year so far, 169 selling days this year and 170 selling days last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

   Big steel and its allies were disappointed
that President Bush extended steel import quotas for only 2{ years,
and some small steelmakers and steel users were disappointed he
didn't end them sooner.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute, the leading voice of the
major producers, expressed great concern and disappointment Tuesday
at the length of the extension.
   The trade group nonetheless welcomed the administration's
decision to free no country and exempt no product category covered
by the 5-year-old voluntary Rrstraint agreements, or quotas,
instituted by President Reagan.
   The bottom line for the Washington-based group is that 2{ years
is too little time to achieve Bush's goal of an international
consensus on ending government subsidization of steel production.
The big producers say subsidies lead to unfair pricing that
violates U.S. trade law and victimizes domestic companies.
   One of the most successful small producers, or mini-mills, Nucor
Corp., said the giants of steel are addicted to government
assistance.
   ``It's like dope,'' said F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's founder and
chairman. ``These guys have had protection for 25 years. It's part
of their way of life to ask the government to continually protect
them.''
   Iverson said the quotas ``cost taxpayers and customers a lot of
money.''
   ``If anything, they have delayed the modernization of our
industry, and in the long run they could do harm to the economy by
having cheaper steel in the international market to produce steel
parts that are imported in competition with American
manufacturers.''
   The Steel Manufacturers Association, representing 46 mini-mills
and their 36,000 employees, thanked Bush for extending the quotas
for 30 months and for seeking an international consensus.
   The 300 steel-using companies represented by the Precision
Metalforming Association applauded Bush's decision and were
encouraged that quotas would be increased 1 percent per year from
the 18.4 percent rate under the original program.
   But the association's president, Jon Jenson, said the
organization would have preferred that the restraints expire this
year.
   The United Steelworkers, however, joined in the criticism.
   ``The termination of the VRA program is assured by the Bush
administration, despite the fact that there will be no assurance
that the foreign government subsidizing measures will be
terminated,'' USW President Lynn Williams said.
   ``The limited duration of the extension will remove any further
pressure to end unfair trade practices because the American market
will soon be open without any rules,'' he said.
   Added U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., ``The president's
decision indicates he still does not fully understand the needs of
America's steel industry.''
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., joined the criticism. ``The chances
are slim to none that even the most determined U.S. negotiators can
end a generation of foreign government subsidizing and unfair
practices in a mere 2{ years,'' he said .
   The General Accounting Office recently declared that the
nation's steel industry has returned to normal levels of
profitability. Reagan imposed the quota program at the peak of a
slump that bled the industry of $12 billion over five years and
eliminated thousands of jobs.
   National Steel Chairman Howard M. Love said as late as Tuesday
morning that a five-year extension of the VRAs was essential to
allow U.S. steel producers to finish modernizing their plants.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Love said late Tuesday, pledging
support for negotiating an international consensus but saying time
is short.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. expressed regret over the length of the
extension.
   ``The basic conditions that dictated the need for VRAs in 1984 _
excessive global steelmaking capacity and unfair trade _ are still
in existence today,'' said Chairman Walter F. Williams.
   Japan said today it would cooperate with the decision to extend
steel import quotas.
   Seiroku Kajiyama, head of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, said Japanese steel companies have worked for many
years with the American steel industry to assist in its
restructuring through technology transfers and joint ventures.
   In upcoming negotiations with U.S. trade officials, Kajiyama
said, Japan will specifically take up ``some vital issues'' such as
the development of free market conditions in world steel trade, the
continuing modernization of the U.S. steel industry and the sound
development of steel industries in both countries.

<HEAD>LIN Broadcasting President Sets Deadline For Deal with McCaw</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp.'s president imposed a
Monday deadline for the conclusion of buyout talks with its
unsolicited suitor, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
   LIN President Donald A. Pels told McCaw officials Monday in a
letter that despite some misgivings, he was willing to support a
buyout at no less than $127.50 a share if a definitive agreement is
reached by 9 a.m. EDT July 31.
   A buyout at that price would value the New York-based cellular
telephone, television broadcasting and publishing company at nearly
$6.9 billion, although McCaw's cost would be lower because it
already owns 9.8 percent of LIN's stock.
   Pels said that if there was no agreement by the deadline, ``we
intend to take such other actions and to pursue such other
available alternatives as our board of directors determines to be
in the long-term interests of LIN's stockholders.''
   A spokesman for Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw, Steven Bruce, said
McCaw had received the letter and its lawyers and investment
bankers planned to respond, although he could not say when.
   In national over-the-counter trading, LIN rose $2.37{ a share
Tuesday to $111.87{, while McCaw rose $1.75 a share to $37.
   McCaw, the nation's biggest cellular telephone company, said
last week it was suspending negotiations with LIN on the
possibility of a buyout at $127.50 a share and was extending its
tender offer of $110 a share for LIN's stock until Aug. 11.
   LIN released a copy of a letter in which its president told
McCaw Chairman Craig O. McCaw that the suspension of talks
disturbed LIN's negotiators because the only apparent obstacle was
how soon the deal could be completed.
   ``We seriously doubt that you are willing to negotiate a `real
deal' to acquire LIN at a fair price to its stockholders,'' Pels
wrote.
   He said McCaw appeared to ``be trying to get an option on LIN or
through your tender offer to steal the company at the lowest
price'' and said LIN had doubts about McCaw's ability to obtain
financing.
   Nonetheless, Pels wrote, he still was prepared to recommend that
the LIN board approve a definitive agreement for McCaw to pay no
less than $127.50 a share for LIN stock provided the agreement is
reached by Monday.
   ``The continued uncertainty about your interest in acquiring LIN
at a fair price is harmful to our stockholders and extremely
disruptive to LIN's ongoing operations and our ability to implement
LIN's long-term strategic plans,'' Pels said.
   McCaw started bidding for LIN in early June with an unsolicited
offer of $120 a share.
   LIN rejected that offer as inadequate and McCaw subsequently
reduced it to $110 a share, citing an unfavorable court ruling
relating to LIN's interest in some cellular telephone operations it
jointly owns with Metromedia Inc.
   On July 13, LIN and McCaw said they were in talks on a possible
buyout at $127.50 a share in cash and stock.
   But McCaw said Friday it was suspending those negotiations and
extended its previous tender offer of $110 a share.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to
$3.1 billion in June as the growth in imports outpaced exports, the
government said Wednesday.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a $2.8 billion
shortfall in May, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Meanwhile, the current account deficit widened to $2.4 billion
from $2.2 billion. The current account includes invisible trade,
such as services, overseas investment earnings and official
transfer payments.
   The figures were better than the markets has expected. Forecasts
had called for a merchandise trade deficit of $3.3 billion and a
current account gap of $2.6 billion.
   The pound rose strongly on the news, jumping to $1.6435 after
the report was released at 11:30 a.m. local time, from $1.6380
before.
   A dock workers' strike at some ports may have depressed recorded
exports, and to a lesser extent imports, the department said.
   Exports rose 3.3 percent, to $12.8 billion from $12.4 billion,
the department said.
   Exports were at record levels but continued to be affected by
production problems as well as by a routine maintenance program
carried out by oil operators in the North Sea, the department said.
   Imports rose 4.5 percent, to $15.9 billion from $15.3 billion.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade deficit
has grown to $19 billion, compared with a deficit of $14 billion a
year earlier.

<HEAD>Judge Denies North Dakota's Bid to Block Sale of Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has cleared the way for
the $3.65 billion sale of Northwest Airlines to a Los Angeles
investment group, likening North Dakota's attempt to impede the
transaction to ``David vs. Goliath.''
   In a five-page decision issued Tuesday, U.S. District Judge
Patrick Conmy refused North Dakota's request for a court order
blocking the sale.
   Conmy said the potential harm to Northwest and its suitor, Wings
Holdings Inc., that would result from blocking the sale outweighed
the ``speculative harm'' to the state.
   David Duffy, a spokesman for Wings, an investment company headed
by Alfred Checchi, a former treasurer of Marriott Corp., said the
one-day uncertainty of whether a judge might block the proposed
sale has not jeopardized the deal.
   ``Our view was the suit was utterly without merit,'' Duffy said.
``We will have an announcement (today) as to the status of the
offer.''
   State officials filed a lawsuit Monday contending the Northwest
buyout would lead to higher fares and violate an agreement
Northwest made with North Dakota in 1986.
   North Dakota's lawsuit claimed the acquisition of Northwest by
Wings would require the airline to restructure to finance its debt,
leaving the state vulnerable to higher fares and radical cuts in
service.
   Conmy said North Dakota Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth should
be commended ``for his efforts _ David vs. Goliath as they may be _
to attempt to force some degree of regulation upon the airline
industry.''
   But in this case, the judge added: ``David is weaponless ... The
attorney general has simply not satisfied his burden of
establishing that the acquistion under the present arrangement
would have the claimed effect on air travel in North Dakota.''
   Checchi said Tuesday he had the financing in place to close the
deal, but he was awaiting a Federal Trade Commission ruling to
clear the way. Wings had asked the FTC to shorten the waiting
period requirement that was scheduled to expire today.
   More than 99 percent of the shares of NWA Inc., Northwest's
parent, have been tendered to Wings, which has offered $121 a share.
   Spaeth on Tuesday acknowledged he had only a ``reasonable
chance'' of convincing a judge to block the sale.
   ``I would have felt bad if I hadn't tried to do something, when
I knew this thing was going to be a disaster for the state,''
Spaeth said at a news conference.
   If Wings acquires the airlines, changes in Northwest's North
Dakota operations will be seen within months, Spaeth predicted.
Northwest will not be able to repay its debts without some ``pretty
drastic steps,'' he said.
   Spaeth's 15-page lawsuit also seeks $50 million in damages from
Northwest for breach of contract between North Dakota and the
airline, meaning the litigation will continue, Spaeth said.
   A court order delaying the sale would have given North Dakota
some leverage to negotiate protections for the state similar to
those obtained in 1986, when Northwest acquired Republic Airlines,
the attorney general said.

   The president and general manager of the Long
Island Rail Road, the nation's largest commuter-train network, has
resigned.
   Bruce McIver, who headed the railroad since 1985, announced his
departure Tuesday saying he wanted to pursue other interests.
   The state Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees
LIRR operations, appointed Peter Stangl, president of the
Metro-North Commuter Railroad, as acting LIRR president.
   Last week the LIRR's state-appointed Commuter's Council called
for McIver's resignation as it released an annual report card
giving the railroad a mediocre grade for overall performance for
the second year in a row.
   LIRR and MTA spokesmen said McIver's decision was not related to
the council's criticism.
   The LIRR carries 272,000 passengers daily.

   The stock market got off to an indecisive start
today amid disappointment about recent corporate earnings reports
and uncertainty about the economy's health.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 6.45 to
2,576.63 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues held a narrow lead over declines on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 487 up, 405 down and 551 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.5 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped 0.06 to 186.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index headed up 0.52 to 370.64.
   Numerous companies have released second-quarter results lately
that have fallen short of or merely matched analysts' expectations.
   Confusion about just how well the economy is doing has made the
market nervous about profit prospects. A significant slowdown,
combined with continuing strength in the dollar, could make things
difficult for many companies.
   The market is hoping a clearer picture about the economy will
emerge from Thursday's report on the Gross National Product for the
second quarter.
   After the first half hour of trading, Ford Motor topped the list
of actively traded NYSE issues and was up \ to 50.
   The second most heavily traded issue was Unisys, the Big Board's
most active issue Tuesday. Unisys perked up a bit, rising \ to 20{,
after losing 1] in the previous session.
   Among heavily traded blue chips, International Business Machines
plunged 1{ to 111\. It was disclosed today that the big computer
maker had to cancel a major new product announcement on Tuesday due
to last-minute technical problems.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average edged down 1.90 to

   In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by
about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 772 up, 684 down and 529 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 0.94 to 182.16.

   Managers of Bjorn Borg's business
operations in Sweden asked bankruptcy officials Wednesday to
examine the company's books in an effort to avert liquidation.
   The five-time Wimbledon champion said Tuesday he would close
down the Scandinavian part of his fashion empire after the partners
rejected his offer to pay the company's debts and sell shares to
employees.
   ``The Bankruptcy Office will make a financial investigation into
the company, which will take 10 to 14 days,'' Peter Smedman, head
of the Central Bankruptcy Office, said on Swedish Radio.
   ``I hope and believe that we will sort this out and enable the
company to live on,'' he said.
   It was not clear whether Borg had agreed to the investigation of
Bjorn Borg Invest AB, which controls Borg's clothing operations in
Sweden.
   Borg's other holdings, registered in Monaco and the English
Channel island of Jersey, apparently were not affected by the move.

   A federal inspector arrived today to
examine records at the General Electric Co. plant that made the
engines on the United Airlines DC-10 that crashed last week in Iowa.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said its
Washington-based inspector, Jack Young, would be at GE's suburban
Cincinnati plant for perhaps two days to examine manufacturing
records.
   Young was accompanied this morning by about 10 representatives
of other organizations assisting the NTSB with its investigation of
the July 19 crash of United Airlines Flight 232 at Sioux City,
Iowa. Of the plane's 296 passengers and crew, 111 people were
killed.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Tuesday that investigators
want to know why the fan section of the No. 2 engine, mounted on
the tail of the jetliner, apparently disintegrated about 45 minutes
into the flight from Denver to Chicago.
   ``We have an uncontained engine failure. We know that. So we're
trying to learn all we can about the manufacturing history of the
engine,'' he said.
   The Federal Aviation Agency's Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma
City said there was no record of any service problems with the No.
2 engine on Flight 232.
   The NTSB said those accompanying Young would include
representatives of the FAA, GE, United, McDonnell Douglas and the
Airline Pilots Association and International Association of
Machinists. The group is one of eight teams set up by the NTSB to
investigate various aspects of the crash.
   The plant made all three of the DC-10's engines. GE and NTSB
officials have declined to disclose the age of the CF6-6 engines,
introduced on the DC-10 in 1971. The DC-10 is the only commercial
jet on which the engine is used, GE officials said.
   The engine has established a record of reliability during its 17
million total flight hours in commercial service, GE said.
   GE said plans are being made to ship the remains of the engine
from Sioux City to the plant for examination. Lopatkiewicz said the
missing engine fan had accumulated 41,009 flight hours since it was
built and 2,170 hours since its last detailed inspection.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Shipping Co. has agreed to post $20
million and meet other requirements to get its crippled tanker
Valdez into dry dock for repairs.
   The oil company signed an agreement Tuesday to comply with state
restrictions as the damaged tanker underwent continued emergency
repair work on the high seas about 56 miles offshore.
   Also Tuesday, Exxon Corp. said it will return to the site of the
nation's worst oil spill next year but stopped short of making a
commitment to further cleanup.
   Nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into Alaska's
Prince William Sound March 24 when the Exxon tanker hit a submerged
reef.
   A July 19 internal memo to Exxon oil spill managers, which was
quoted in news reports Monday, suggested that the oil company's
cleanup crews would leave Alaska for good after shutting down for
the winter.
   But at a hastily called news conference Tuesday in Valdez,
Alaska, Otto Harrison, general manager for Exxon Valdez operations
in Alaska, said the memo did not rule out a resumption of cleanup
operations.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Tuesday that
Exxon's plan to halt cleanup efforts Sept. 15 was justified because
little can be accomplished once cold weather arrives.
   Skinner, previously a critic of Exxon's cleanup effort, said in
remarks at Republican fund-raising dinner in Chicago he now is
satisfied with it.
   He said more than 10,000 Exxon employees are ``working 16 hours
a day to make sure that everything that can be done, will be done
in Alaska before the weather sets in this fall.''
   During the winter the company plans to conduct scientific
studies in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, Harrison
said. A survey team will return to Alaska in the spring, he added,
but he would not say whether the company would mobilize another big
cleanup effort then.
   ``We'll be here to determine what the condition is and we'll
make our decision at that time in consultation with the federal
government,'' Harrison said. ``I can't speculate on cleanup in the
spring until we make that determination.''
   In San Diego, the California Assembly's Select Committee on Oil
Spill Prevention and Response Preparedness heard testimony Tuesday
on the status of the tanker Valdez and Exxon's efforts to bring it
into dry dock.
   ``The state of California is in the same position as the state
of Alaska when they had the (Valdez) accident, and it must be
corrected,'' said Assemblyman Gerald Felando, who visited Alaska in
June.
   The Coast Guard denied the ship entry to San Diego Bay on July
10 because of an 18-mile slick and other discharges. The ship faced
navigational problems as well when steel plates separated from the
hull during the 2,500-mile trip from Alaska.
   The plates cut loose Monday were dangling too deep to negotiate
the bay.
   Samples from two slicks that coincided with the Valdez's arrival
in Southern California waters showed traces of Alaskan North Slope
crude mixed with heavy concentrations of marine life now living in
the ship's shredded cargo tanks.
   But Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro said other preliminary test
results showed no toxicity and barely detectable hydrocarbon levels.
   ``As far as the Coast Guard is concerned, as long as everything
else has been put in place, I see no reason why the vessel can't
come into port,'' he said.
   Montoro has the final say on when the Valdez can enter San Diego
Bay en route to National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. for a $25
million repair. He said the entry would likely take place between
Friday and Sunday.

<HEAD>Family Loses Loses Insurance After $2.75 Million in Medical Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family has lost its health insurance after
running up $2.75 million in medical bills since the births of
quintuplets two years ago.
   Provident Life and Accidental Insurance of Chattanooga, Tenn.,
canceled the group policy that covers Ron and Roz Helms and their
family effective next month.
   Other insurers have refused to provide a policy for the family
after the multimillion-dollar payout, Mrs. Helms said Tuesday.
   ``It doesn't look good for us right now,'' Mrs. Helms said.
``It's pretty scary to think we won't have any insurance.''
   The family's claim was the biggest in the history of
Transamerica Life Co., the original carrier, said Jeff Shaw,
general agent for Transamerica. Transamerica sold its group
insurance division, which carried the group policy, to Provident a
year ago.
   ``They stayed on as long as they could for the Helmses,'' said
Shaw, who is trying to find another company willing to insure the
family.
   The family was insured under a group policy that originally
covered about 30 employees of Mercedes Restaurants Inc., which owns
the restaurant that Helms manages. Provident canceled the group
policy because of declining membership blamed on premium increases.
   The premium hikes were needed to cover increased claims,
including those for the quintuplets, said Provident spokeswoman
Jane Overbeck.
   ``The group didn't have enough members and the group's claim
losses were taken into consideration,'' Ms. Overbeck said.
   Mrs. Helms said she's worried her family may have to sell their
house and cars and take pay cuts to qualify for public assistance.
   ``It's crazy that they'd drop us now when we're basically
healthy,'' she said. ``The worst is over. It's behind us.''
   The babies were born prematurely on March 2, 1987, and suffered
a variety of medical problems that kept them in the hospital for
long periods of time. Samantha, the smallest and most frequently
ill, lived most of her first year in a hospital bed.
   Mrs. Helms said Provident canceled its coverage effective Aug.
1, although its contract requires it to continue paying for
existing medical conditions for a year until a new insurer can be
found for the children: Shannon, Meredith, Bevin, Samantha and
Benjamin.
   Those payments include $3,000 per month for oxygen, medicine and
a home nurse for Samantha, and the $50 per week spent on physical
therapy for Benjamin, who has cerebral palsy. But new illnesses,
injuries and medicine will not be covered, Ms. Overbeck said.

   Prime Computer Inc. postponed its annual
meeting set for today to give shareholders more time to weigh
competing offers for the minicomputer maker.
   The meeting was postponed until Aug. 9, Prime said in a
statement released 90 minutes before the meeting was to begin.
   Prime's seven directors, who face re-election against a slate of
candidates from hostile suitor MAI Basic Four Inc., also
recommended again that the company accept a $1.2 billion buyout
offer from J.H. Whitney &amp; Co.
   J.H. Whitney, the nation's oldest venture capital firm, has
offered $21.50 a share in case for about 50 million Prime shares
and would exchange notes for the rest.
   Prime's board said the offer from the New York firm is
``economically superior'' to MAI Basic's proposal to buy Prime's
minicomputer division for $450 million in cash and $150 million in
notes.
   An MAI Basic spokeswoman no comment on the delay in the annual
meeting. It was the third time Prime postponed the meeting, which
previously had been scheduled for May 12 and June 15.
   Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic has been attempting to acquire
Prime in a hostile bid since last November, but J.H. Whitney made
its friendly offer last month.
   MAI Basic then offered to buy Prime's minicomputer business,
which accounted for about one-third of the company's 1988 revenue
of $1.6 billion. MAI Basic's slate of board candidates has said it
would sell the minicomputer division to MAI Basic and use the
proceeds to buy back Prime stock.
   The promise of a stock repurchase was considered an enticement
to shareholders because it would likely drive up Prime's share
price.
   In addition to its minicomputer business, Prime is the
second-largest producer of computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems, surpassed only by International Business Machines Corp.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
rebounding from recent declines.
   Analysts said the rally was largely a reaction to steep recent
declines. Soybean futures prices, for example, had fallen in each
of the four previous sessions.
   ``I think we got the markets oversold; prices got a little too
cheap in the short run,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of
trading-floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp., a New
York-based futures brokerage.
   But he said corn and soybean prices were likely to fall further
if normal weather patterns _ mild temperatures and weekly showers _
continue in the Midwest.
   With more than half the corn crop now past the sensitive
pollination phase, Zusel said traders were shifting attention to
the soybean crop, which is entering its critical flowering and
pod-setting stage.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 2} cents higher with September at $2.30 a bushel; oats
were 2 cents to 2} cents higher with September at $1.45 a bushel;
soybeans were 5{ cents to 8 cents higher with August at $6.68 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .33 cent higher with August
at 72.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .17
cent higher with August at 83.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .20
cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at 46.05 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .40 cent lower with August at
27.70 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday its earnings
for the second quarter of 1989 jumped 43 percent.
   Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer of Compaq,
said international sales were especially high during the quarter,
accounting for 44 percent of total sales.
   For the three-month period ending June 30, Houston-based Compaq
had earnings of $83.9 million, or $1.95 per share, on sales of
$722.1 million compared to earnings of $58.6 million, or $1.45 per
share on sales of $456.8 million in the 1988 quarter.
   ``Worldwide demand for our two recently-introduced desktops, the
Compaq Deskpro 386@33 and Compaq Deskpro 286e, as well as
continuing strong sales of the Compaq SLT@286 laptop and 386
desktop line gave Compaq another outstanding quarter,'' Canion said.
   On the international market, Compaq said its share of Europe's
seven largest personal computer markets grew during the first
quarter of 1989 to 10.2 percent, making it the second largest
supplier of personal computers to the European business market.
   In May, the company announced plans to almost double the size of
its manufacturing and office facility in Erskine, Scotland. The
$37.5 million expansion is the third at the facility since its
opening in 1987. The workforce at the facility is expected to
double over the next three years.
   Compaq expanded into South America during the quarter with sales
beginning in Chile, Venezuela and Colombia. New subsidiaries also
were established in Denmark and Norway.
   The company announced earlier this month that it had signed a
patent cross-license agreement with rival IBM in which each company
granted to the other a worldwide non-exclusive license covering
patents having an effective filing date before July 1, 1993.
   For the first six months of 1989, Compaq recorded a net income
of $167.1 million, or $3.89 per share, on sales of $1.4 billion,
compared to $105.5 million, or $2.66 per share, on sales of $896.3
million during the same period in 1988.

   The European Community today criticized
President Bush's decision to extend steel import quotas, saying the
American industry has made an impressive comeback in recent years.
   Bush said he took the measure in an effort to press negotiations
to end other countries' unfair trade practices and give the U.S.
industry more time to modernize its operations.
   But the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc,
protested.
   ``After an uninterrupted period of protection ..., a renewal of
these accords in the steel sector is not necessary considering the
remarkable progress registered by American steel,'' it said in a
statement.
   The industry has improved both financially and competitively,
and the world outlook for steel has brightened, it said.
   The community also complained the quotas have limited European
steelmakers' access to the American market but other foreign
producers have not been restricted.
   It said it wanted more information from the United States about
Bush's decision.
   Thomas Niles, the new American ambassador to the EC, said, ``We
look forward to discussing this program with them.''
   In an interview, he said the U.S. action was designed to give
more time to come up with a market-based system for trading in
steel.
   ``We should try to turn steel trade into a market-driven
operation rather than one that is driven largely by government
subsidies and interventions by governments in the market,'' he said.
   He suggested EC officials, when they take a closer look at the
program, ``will see it as in their interest to join with us in this
effort to move toward a market-based system.''
   The community's share of the American steel market tumbled from
8 percent before the quotas to 5.6 percent afterward, according to
EC figures. The trading bloc exported 5.9 million metric tons of
steel products to the United States in 1988.
   The quotas were first imposed by the Reagan administration in
1984. They were due to expire on Sept. 30.
   They set annual limits on the amount of steel that could be
brought into the United States from 29 countries, including those
of the European Community, Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
   The quotas were imposed at a time the American industry was
suffering heavy losses. Steel manufacturers complained foreign
producers had an unfair advantage because of hefty government
subsidies and import restrictions.
   They now say the U.S. import quotas have helped the giant
industry become profitable again. But they argue they still need
time to bring their operations up-to-date without competition from
subsidized foreign products.
   In his announcement Tuesday, Bush said he had asked U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills to negotiate a 30-month extension of the
voluntary restraint agreements that limit the 29 countries to 18.4
percent of the U.S. market. The European Community's share of the
total quota is 27 percent.
   Bush said the restrictions will end on March 31, 1992.

   Internal Revenue Service inspectors allowed
``front office favorites'' in the agency's Los Angeles office to
get away with misconduct, witnesses told a House subcommittee today.
   The inspection service should be separated from other functions
of the IRS to protect it from conflict of interest problems, the
witnesses told the House Government Operations subcommittee on
commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   ``Agents were reluctant to report employee conduct violations to
the inspection service if it involved a manager or one of the front
office favorites,'' said Chuck McCalmont, a former group manager
for the IRS Criminal Investigative Division.
   The office in general was divided into the ``front office
favorites'' and the ``lunatic fringe,'' McCalmont said. Those who
disagreed with the managers of the CID were labeled the ``lunatic
fringe,'' he said.
   ``The agents also felt if the allegation involved a so-called
lunatic fringe agent, inspection, with the backing of our front
office, went all out to prove the allegation,'' McCalmont said.
   Frank Rippetoe, former inspector in the Los Angeles office, said
one of the managers of the inspection division had a ``special
relationship'' with Ron Saranow, head of the CID.
   As a result, when Saranow became the subject of an internal
probe because of his dealings with Guess? jeans makers, agents were
reluctant to talk to inspectors because they felt everything they
said would get back to Saranow, said another former inspector, Russ
Davis.
   Saranow was not scheduled to testify before the subcommittee.
   The former inspectors' testimony came on the second day of
hearings by the subcommittee into problems within the CID,
including allegations about Saranow's involvement in a dispute
between the makers of Guess? and Jordache jeans. Those allegations
led to an expanded probe, in which subcommittee investigators said
they found the IRS sometimes seeks to protect its image at the
expense of uncovering wrongdoing by its employees.
   ``There appears to be a longstanding institutional mindset which
says protect the image and integrity of the IRS at all cost because
the image is vital to a voluntary compliance system which relies on
taxpayer integrity,'' said investigators Leonard Bernard and
Richard Stana said Tuesday.
   ``Our investigation revealed, for example, that on a number of
occasions, IRS national office officials at the highest levels
ignored instances of wrongdoing by senior managers in Washington
D.C. and elsewhere,'' Stana told the committee.
   IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg, who is to testify Thursday, said
in prepared testimony he disagrees with the investigators'
characterization of the agency as being more concerned about image
than possible internal wrongdoing.
   ``The public knows that we are a large agency and that we will
make mistakes,'' he said. ``I believe our image is enhanced _ not
tarnished _ when the public knows that we aggressively investigate
and punish wrongdoing by IRS employees.''
   Saranow was approached in 1985 by the half-owners of Guess? with
information about alleged tax fraud by their business partners, who
were the owners of Jordache Enterprises, said Bernard and Stana.
   The subcommittee investigators said the Guess? owners'
information was of ``dubious value and questionable quality,'' but
Saranow pursued an aggressive two-year investigation of Jordache
without turning up any criminal violation.
   The investigators said the Guess? owners ``exercised unusual
influence over Ronald Saranow by cultivating a strong personal and
social relationship with him and by offering him a six-figure
salary.''
   The Guess owners _ Paul, George, Armand and Maurice Marciano of
Los Angeles _ denied offering a job to Saranow, who has retired
from the IRS and was never disciplined or prosecuted.
   Another case involved Anthony Langone, the southeast assistant
regional commissioner for criminal investigation based in
Washington, who the investigators said improperly used government
travel funds to maintain a relationship with a woman in Atlanta.
   Bernard and Stana said Langone's case was not aggressively
pursued by the IRS until two years after it had been reported
several times by different individuals. The case now has been
turned over to the Justice Department.
   Ellen Murphy, director of public affairs for the IRS, said the
agency would have no comment about specific cases because of
privacy laws covering taxes.

<HEAD>Hooker Seeks Provisional Liquidator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooker Corp., owner of retail and real
estate holdings in Australia and the United States, Wednesday
applied for a provisional liquidator after failure of a financial
rescue.
   The Sydney-based holding company owes the equivalent of more
than $1.2 billion to 42 banks, which on Tuesday refused to grant
the company any more credit, forcing Hooker to seek a liquidator to
take charge of the company.
   A collapse of Hooker, which owns B. Altman &amp; Co., Bonwit Teller
plus other U.S. department stores and shopping malls, would be one
of Australia's biggest corporate crashes.
   The company said it asked the Supreme Court of New South Wales
to appoint John Harkness of the accounting firm Peat Marwick
Hungerfords as the provisional liquidator.
   Hooker said its directors believe their ``action in standing
aside will resolve the impasse with the banks and is therefore in
the best interests of employees, creditors and shareholders.''
   The provisional liquidator will have wide powers over all
aspects of the business, Hooker said, including the sale or
retention of assets, raising additional funds if required and
employment.
   Directors will fully assist in facilitating the changeover of
the company's affairs into the hands of the provisional liquidator,
Hooker said.
   Hooker's assets totaled about $1.8 billion and its liabilities
were $1.4 billion as of March 31.
   In the United States, besides B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller,
Hooker controls Sakowitz Inc., Parisian Inc. and Merksamer Jewelers
Inc. It has interests in shopping malls, commercial real estate and
house building.
   People familiar with Hooker's U.S. operations said that the
First National Bank of Chicago has started foreclosure proceedings
on Hooker's Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., the Wall
Street Journal reported Thursday.
   J. Frank Haasbeek, president of L.J. Hooker Corp., the U.S.
subsidiary of Hooker, was unavailable for comment on the report.
   The company in May announced plans to sell assets to reduce
debt. That followed cash-flow problems in the United States that
caused Hooker to fall behind in payments to several apparel and
other suppliers.
   In June, Hooker's financial difficulties appeared to become more
serious and the company hired Richard Grellman of Peat Marwick as a
financial adviser. The company conceded it had a liquidity problem
and said some banks had cut credit lines. Directors blamed rising
interest rates, an economic slowdown, a weaker Australian dollar
and adverse publicity for the problems.
   Hooker's 42 Australian and foreign lenders had agreed, until
Tuesday's announcement, to forgo loan repayments and to keep credit
lines open while the company worked out a plan to sell more assets
under controlled conditions, rather than in a fire-sale.
   George Herscu, who owns about 50 percent of Hooker, resigned as
chief executive on July 11, but has stayed on as chairman.

   A Cornell University graduate student was
indicted today on charges stemming from creation of a computer
virus that infected as many as 6,000 computers in a nationwide
network used by universities and the military.
   Robert Tappan Morris was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Syracuse, N.Y., on one count of accessing without authorization at
least six computers in which the federal government has an interest.
   Morris, who has been criticized by a Cornell University
commission that investigated last November's computer virus
incident, is the first person to be charged under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, the Justice Department said in a
statement released here.
   Morris, who is on leave from Cornell, could face a possible
five-year sentence and a $250,000 fine if convicted of the charge.
He could also be required to pay restitution to universities and
military bases where computers were paralyzed by the virus.
   Thomas A. Guidoboni, Morris' attorney, said his client ``accepts
this event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter.''
   ``An indictment is simply a formal accusation,'' Guidoboni said.
``Mr. Morris will enter a plea of not guity and contest the charge
against him.'' Morris ``looks forward to his eventual vindication
and his return to a normal life,'' the defense lawyer said.
   The virus infected as many as 6,000 university and military
computers on the nationwide ARPANET network, which is used by
universities and military contractors to transmit non-classified
data.
   The network was virtually shut down for several days, although
no information stored in computers was lost.
   The indictment charged that Morris ``intentionally and without
authorization'' accessed computers located at the University of
California at Berkeley; the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in Moffett Field, Calif.; Purdue University in West
Lafayette, Ind.; the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command at Wright
Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and others not specified.
   By accessing these computers, Morris ``prevented the authorized
use of one or more of these federal interest computers and thereby
caused a loss to one or more others'' of more than $1,000, the
indictment charged.
   The indictment did not specify how much damage was caused by the
computer virus.

   Here are some tips for do-it-yourselfers in the home-selling
market, according to J.R. Paine, author of ``The 30 Day Way To Sell
Your Home'':
   _Begin by making a checklist of all critical areas of your home,
starting with the front yard, eyeing areas that need repair.
   _Dress up your home. ``A house with a neglected appearance
loudly tells the prospective buyers that its owners do not like it,
do not want it, and do not think it has any value or worth.''
   _Get a reliable appraisal of your home's true value.
   _Select the best time to market your home. ``As a rule warm
weather is more conducive to home sales in cold climates, and cold
weather is more conducive in home sales in warm climates.''
   _Get a ``For Sale'' sign.
   _Select a real estate attorney.
   _Select a title company to do your title work.
   _Contact a local lender to obtain current interest rates.
   _Use ``action-inspiring'' advertising expressions, emphasizing
money appeal with words like ``economical,'' ``bargain'' or
``value''; or ego appeal, with words like ``elegant,'' ``graceful''
or ``fashionable.'' A homeowner might describe negative attributes
like a dirt road, as a low traffic street safe for children and
pets, or run-down property as a handyman's dream.

   The Puchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $264.9 million,
or $1 a share, in the three months ended June 17 compared with
$219.6 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 23.8 percent to $3.59 billion from
$2.9 billion a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax credit of $15 million
for several one-time events, the largest of which was a decision to
keep rather than sell a foreign bottling operation.
   The operating profit from the company's soft drink business
soared 60 percent to $239.6 million while sales rose 33 percent to
$1.5 billion.
   Excluding one-time events and the net effect of bottling
acquisitions, operating profits still rose 32 percent and sales
rose 9 percent.
   The growth in operating profits reflected strong domestic
results, due to volume growth, higher pricing and efforts to
control costs, the company said.
   It said its Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew brands posted
double-digit growth in case sales in the United States.
   The snack foods business had an operating profit of $191.7
million, up 24 percent from a year earlier, on a 17 percent revenue
increase to $958 million. Its domestic profits rose at a
double-digit pace while international profits more than tripled.
   The company said domestic volume for Frito-Lay rose 8 percent
led by gains in the Ruffles, Fritos and Doritos brands.
   The company's restaurant business earnings rose 15 percent to
$102.1 million, while sales rose 20 percent to nearly $1.2 billion.
   Earnings were up 41 percent to $51.8 million at the Pizza Hut
restaurants and 60 percent to $32.4 million at Taco Bell
restuarants, but fell 44 percent to $17.9 million at Kentucky Fried
Chicken.
   The decline at Kentucky Fried Chicken was blamed on an $8
million charge for consolidating its field operations, higher costs
for chicken and labor and lower customer counts.
   For the first six months, Pepsico earned $430 million, or $1.62
per share, up 29.2 percent from $332.9 million, or $1.27 a share, a
year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 21.7 percent to $6.55 billion from $5.38
billion.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Legislation Ending Price Controls on Natural Gas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring the the best way to
deal with energy problems ``is to let our market economy work,''
today signed legislation ending the last vestiges of price controls
on natural gas.
   The president used the White House signing ceremony to reiterate
his call for increased domestic oil exploration and drilling to
curb the country's reliance on oil imports.
   ``The bottom line is, a strong domestic drilling and producing
business is essential for the national security of the United
States of America,'' Bush said.
   He said Energy Secretary James Watkins will develop a detailed
national energy strategy in the coming months to deal with future
energy requirements.
   Watkins was to present a general outline of the administration's
energy policy at a congressional hearing. It is expected to include
emphasis on expanded reliance on nuclear power and a call for more
oil exploration along coastal areas.
   In signing the natural gas decontrol bill, which was passed by
Congress earlier this year, the president signaled the end to 35
years of price control on the fuel.
   Full natural gas decontrol is not expected to affect retail
prices significantly because most gas already is selling below the
official ceilings. However, critics maintain that full decontrol
will set the stage for price increases in the 1990s.
   The administration's energy strategy was expected to include
renewed efforts to win public acceptance for an expanded nuclear
power industry and a call for more oil exploration, including along
coastal areas.
   Offshore oil drilling has raised widespread concerns because of
the devastating damage and pollution caused by the massive oil
spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker in Alaska's Prince William Sound
in March.
   Legislation is advancing in Congress that would extend a
moratorium on such drilling to vast offshore stretches from New
England to Alaska. The Bush administration has opposed any such
moratorium extension.
   Shortly after he became energy secretary, Watkins ordered the
department to develop an ``action plan'' for dealing with expected
energy needs, including more accurate estimates on future energy
requirements.
   Calls for a revised national energy policy have intensified amid
falling U.S. petroleum production and increasing demand. At the
same time, there has been increasing pressure from
environmentalists to curb the use of fossil fuels because they are
a chief contributor to global warming.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore has said the department had
no preconceived notions about the focus of a national energy
policy. But he suggested an effort would be made to revive the
nuclear industry by making nuclear power more acceptable, and that
oil companies could be given more latitude to explore for oil on
federal lands or in promising offshore areas.
   Moore acknowledged the department must assemble more in-depth
information on energy needs that is viewed as credible by producers
and consumers alike.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mixed In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose while corn and soybean
futures closed narrowly mixed Wednesday in quiet trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts attributed most of the buying in all the markets to
perceptions that prices were exaggeratedly low after recent
declines.
   Selling in the corn and soybean pits was based largely on ideas
that recent rains in the Midwest had improved crop conditions.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of exchange floor operations with Balfour
Maclaine Corp., a futures brokerage firm, said that with more than
half the corn crop now past the sensitive pollination phase,
traders had begun to shift their focus to the soybean crop, which
is nearing its critical flowering and pod-setting stage.
   ``It'll be pretty difficult to damage the corn crop from here on
in but weather can still be an important factor for the beans,''
Zusel said. ``If we get normal-type temperatures and fair coverage
by showers on a weekly basis over the next four to five weeks, the
bean crop will be made, too.''
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to { cent higher with September at $2.29\ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with September at $1.42}
a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with August
at $6.62 a bushel.

<HEAD>Goodyear Second-Quarter Profits Tumble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings tumbled 80 percent primarily because of
losses from the sale of its South Africa unit and unused pipe
inventories.
   Goodyear said it made $27.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the
quarter ended June 30. That compared with earnings of $134.9
million, or $2.35 per share, for the same 1988 period.
   Second-quarter sales rose about 1 percent to $2.81 billion from
last year's $2.79 billion.
   Goodyear said after-tax loss provisions totaling $95 million
were responsible for the downturn. The provisions included $43
million in the sale of its unit in racially segregated South Africa
and $48.3 million for the sale of unused pipe held by its All
American Pipeline subsidiary.
   Sales of the South African subsidiary and the unused pipe are
expected to be completed during the third quarter, the company said.
   Cash proceeds of $41 million for the South Africa unit and a
pipe sale price of $70 million had been expected, Goodyear said in
a statement.
   Goodyear Chairman Tom H. Barrett said the company would focus on
``cost reduction and profit improvement programs as well as adjust
production plans, mostly in relation to the extended shutdown in
automotive scheduling.''
   For the first six months of 1989, Goodyear reported earnings of
$121.6 million, or $2.11 a share, on sales of $5.45 billion. That
compared with earnings of $230.2 million, or $4.02 a share, on
sales of $5.33 billion in the first half of 1988.

<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham, a new international
pharmaceutical firm, was created Wednesday after SmithKline Beckman
Corp. shareholders overwhelmingly approved a merger with Beecham
Group PLC of Britain.
   ``We have a unique opportunity to take the strengths and
traditions of both companies and create a new global competitor in
the very first rank of the health care industry,'' said Henry
Wendt, SmithKline's chief executive officer and chairman of the
merged company.
   With combined sales exceeding $6 billion, SmithKline Beecham
becomes the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company after
Merck &amp; Co.
   About 59 percent of SmithKline's 126,906,109 million outstanding
shares voted on the merger proposal, with 99 percent supporting it,
although a few stockholders were disappointed that the new
company's headquarters would be in London and future annual
meetings would be held there.
   Wendt said, however, that satellite meetings would be held in
Philadelphia, which will remain the center of American operations,
``so we are not leaving Philadelphia, we are gaining London.''
   Beecham stockholders approved the merger in June.
   In the merger, each SmithKline Beckman shareholder will receive
a package of five common shares and one preferred share of
SmithKline Beecham, plus a half share of Allergan, one-eighth share
of Beckman Instruments and a $5.50 dividend.
   SmithKline Beecham's leading consumer products will be the
antacid Tums, the over-the-counter cold medicine Contac and throat
lozenge Sucrets.
   The company also will have three of the 10 most widely
prescribed drugs in the United States _ Tagamet, the leading ulcer
medication; Dyazide for hypertension and high blood pressure; and
Augmentin, an antibiotic that Beecham had been marketing.

   Rising interest costs cut second-quarter earnings
at General Motors Corp.'s financing subsidiary, while the
automaker's two other major subsidiaries reported increases for the
period, the companies said Wednesday.
   Sales of communications satellite services pushed earnings to
new highs at GM Hughes Electronics Corp. Demand for data processing
services by banks and other customers boosted results at Electronic
Data Systems Corp.
   The parent company's earnings report was expected Thursday.
   The finance subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp., said
net income from its financing, insurance and mortgage operations
was $268.6 million for the three months ended June 30, nearly a 20
percent drop from $333.9 million in the second quarter of 1988.
   GMAC said its financing and leasing business in the United
States increased 27 percent in volume from the earlier period, but
interest costs soared. The company said its average cost of
borrowings worldwide was 9.53 percent for the quarter, up from 7.94
percent a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, GMAC reported consolidated
net income of $625 million, down from $688.3 million for the first
half of 1988.
   GMAC had total assets of $102.8 billion June 30, up from $99.9
billion a year earlier, spokesman John Andrews said.
   GM Hughes Electronics said its telecommunications growth
included sales of satellite services to three operations: a joint
venture of HBO and Turner Broadcasting System; ESPN, the nation's
largest cable network; and CBS.
   The company reported second-quarter earnings of $240 million, or
60 cents a share of General Motors Class H stock, up from $180
million, or 50 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1988.
   The per-share earnings set a second-quarter record, the company
said. The previous record was in the year-earlier period. GM Class
H stock is an issue with earnings based on GM Hughes Electronics'
performance.
   The second-quarter earnings a year earlier were boosted by
one-time gains from stock sales. Earnings from operations
comparable to 1989 would have been $180 million, or 45 cents a
share, spokesman Bruce McCristal said.
   GM Hughes Electronics said second-quarter revenue was $2.88
billion for the quarter, up slightly from $2.87 billion a year
earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, the company reported
earnings of $450.4 million, or $1.11 a share, on revenue of $5.89
billion, compared with earnings of $453 million, of $1.13 a share,
on revenue of $5.54 billion in the first half of 1988.
   The six-month figures in 1988 were boosted by one-time gains
from the second-quarter stock sales and a first-quarter accounting
change, McCristal said. Without those changes, comparable operating
earnings for 1988 would have been $366 million, or 90 cents a
share, he said.
   EDS said its second-quarter net income was $104.9 million, or 87
cents a share of GM Class E Stock, on revenue of $1.38 billion, up
from $95.7 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $1.20
billion in the second quarter of 1988. GM Class E stock earnings
are based on EDS performance.
   For the first six months of the year, EDS reported net income of
$204.9 million, or $1.69 a share, on revenue of $2.66 billion. That
was up from $184.8 billion, or $1.51 a share, on revenue of $2.32
billion for the first half of 1988.

   A late buying wave buoyed blue chip stocks,
carrying the Dow Jones industrial average back above the 2,600-mark
as the market moved ahead today.
   The market rode a see-saw during the session with the Dow
industrials reversing course several times while, in the broader
market, advancing and declining issues on the New York Stock
Exchange exchanged the lead a few times.
   For much of the day, traders unloaded International Business
Machines and other technology stocks in the wake of a bearish
forecast for the personal computer market. But the selloff helped
lure bargain hunters off the sidelines and IBM, for one stock,
ended the day having recouped most of its earlier loss.
   Confusion about just how well the economy is doing has made the
market nervous about corporate profit prospects. A significant
slowdown, combined with continuing strength in the dollar, could
make things difficult for many companies.
   Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at Blunt
Ellis &amp; Loewi, said stocks might have gotten a lift from a decline
in the dollar's value against other major currencies today.
   ``Maybe we lifted some recession fears today with the dollar
coming off as it did,'' said Czech. ``The dollar is indicating
maybe we'll get export business moving in the right direction
again.''
   The market also is hopinga clearer picture about the economy
will emerge from Thursday's report on the Gross National Product
for the second quarter.

   The city gave final approval today for IBM
Corp. to build a 26-story office building on the desirable Inner
Harbor section, where buildings were limited to 17 stories, in
exchange for a payment of $700,000.
   IBM also agreed to maintain public spaces at the two-acre site,
a commitment valued at $300,000 a year, and donate $45,000 to a
fund to maintain public art.
   The final approval came from the city Board of Estimates, which
had to approve any change in the restrictions.
   The City Council passed a bill last month that would lift the
current 175-foot height limit in the area that was part of the
standards established under a urban renewal plan in the late 1960s,
said Albert M. Copp, president of Center City-Inner Harbor
Development Inc. The non-profit company handles development
management for the city of Baltimore.
   The $50 million office tower would house the expanded
headquarters of T. Rowe Price Associates as well as IBM's Baltimore
offices and other office space.
   City officials said negotiations began recently between IBM and
the city because the price of the tract, $1.42 million, when the
city sold it to IBM in 1970, reflected restrictions placed on the
site. If the restrictions are lifted the value of the land
increases, and the city deserves more for it, city officials said.
   Lessening zoning restrictions in exchange for cash or public
amenities is an arrangement used in many major cities. It has come
under fire particularly in New York, where critics say the benefits
do not compensate for the problems caused by overbuilding.

<HEAD>Dunkin' Donuts Gets Injunction Against Canadian Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked a
hostile $305 million takeover bid for Dunkin' Donuts, saying the
Canadian bidders failed to disclose prior securities law violations.
   U.S. District Judge Edward F. Harrington ordered D.D.
Acquisition Corp., a partnership formed by Kingsbridge Capital
Group, a subsidiary of Unicorp Canada Corp., and Cara Operations
Ltd., to give Dunkin' Donuts shareholders a revised purchase offer.
   The judge also ordered Unicorp to provide information from the
Ontario Securities Commission staff saying the company had violated
Canadian securities regulations in a previous unrelated takeover
offer.
   Unicorp, a Toronto-based real estate, banking and energy firm,
owns 12 percent of Dunkin' Donuts' stock. It joined with Cara, a
food services company, in the $43-a-share tender offer.
   The judge also ordered the partnership to delay buying any more
Dunkin' Donuts stock until the revised purchase offer had
circulated among shareholders for 10 business days.
   Dunkin' Donuts Chairman Robert M. Rosenberg issued a letter to
stockholders Wednesday advising them to disregard the tender offer.
   ``Any drastic change in ownership, in our opinion, will threaten
and-or destroy this delicate balance and jeopardize our future
prospects,'' Rosenberg said in the letter.
   Eric Evans, associate director of Kingsbridge, played down the
significance of the injunction, saying the company would either
appeal the decision or provide the required information.
   He said the takeover bid cited by the judge _ for Canada's
second-largest utility corporation about five years ago _ was not a
violation of Canadian securities law.
   Evans said shareholders ``weren't treated fairly'' initially in
the deal, but added: ``We still deny that there were any
violations. Things run differently here.''

<TEXT>
   Lee Iacocca, the driver behind the
restoration of Chrysler Corp. and Statue of Liberty, the irreverent
executive who's done his own ads and guest-starred on prime-time
TV, is content these days to sit back a little and take it easy,
letting others run the business.
   But when it comes to key decisions at Chrysler, the 64-year-old
chairman is ready to assert himself over subordinates with
undisputed authority.
   ``I try not to get in their hair, but I do,'' Iacocca said in an
interview. ``I'm trying to stay out the best I can. But right now,
we've got a lot of tough, tough decisions to make. How do you
prioritize?''
   Company executives are confronting several problems: a declining
market share, a slowing economy, the relentless competition from
Japan and now Korea, improving the mix of vehicle models and
allaying investor concerns.
   Chrysler's second-quarter earnings are due Monday. Analysts
expect a slight increase over the $320.4 million the nation's No. 3
automaker made during the same period last year. But they hedge the
prediction because Chrysler has spent so much on incentives to sell
its cars and trucks.
   Through July 20, Chrysler's car and truck sales were running 8
percent behind the pace of last year, a worse showing than its Big
Three rivals, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   There's little doubt the total market demand this year will fall
well below the 15.8 million vehicles sold last year, one of the
best in industry history.
   Iacocca estimates sales between 13.5 million and 14 million
vehicles this year, the lowest estimate of the Big Three chairmen.
GM's Roger Smith predicts about 15 million, and Ford's Donald
Petersen reckons about 14.7 million.
   ``I've been saying this for a lot of years, and it's the old
story, I'll have to be right one year. We're going to have to have
a pause, a recession,'' Iacocca said. ``I thought it would be
mid-'88 to mid-'89, I think I was off by a good, solid year.''
   He predicted a tough time for the next 12 to 18 months, but said
Chrysler, the auto industry and the U.S. economy are in better
shape now than they were before the last big industry slump in the
early 1980s.
   ``We were worst of the three at that time, but they (GM and
Ford) weren't very far behind if this would have kept up,'' he said.
   In a move that's been written into the business history books, a
sickly Chrysler beseeched the federal government for help in the
late 1970s and eventually secured $1.5 billion in loan guarantees
to survive.
   Under Iacocca's guidance, Chrysler repaid the loans seven years
early, and he frequently talks about that with a mix of humor and
bluntness.
   When he first disclosed Chrysler's early-repayment plan at the
National Press Club in Washington in July 1983, Iacocca told
reporters: ``We at Chrysler borrow money the old fashioned way. We
pay it back.''
   Nonetheless, the company is still a bit wobbly and faces
significant questions about its long-term direction.
   Measured by sales, Chrysler is becoming a truck company. Through
the first six months of the year, it sold more trucks than cars,
partly because of the trend-setting minivans _ the Dodge Caravan
and the Plymouth Voyager _ and Jeeps, which Chrysler got buy
purchasing American Motors Corp. in August 1987.
   Chrysler commands more than 55 percent of the minivan market,
which Iacocca says will be impossible to hold because of
competition from imports and a new line of GM minivans.
   Iacocca recalled when he introduced minivans in 1983: ``I
remember some wise-ass at Ford said, `They are on dope over there.'
They said it was a little nothing, it was sort of a fad. Who would
want a little van when they could get a big van?
   ``What they forgot is that you weren't going after the van or
wagon owner, you were going after the four-door sedan owner and
there's 5 million of those a year.''
   Whether they're minivan buyers or not, Iacocca goes after them
all, many times personally.
   Since Nov. 1, 1978, when he was fired as president of Ford and
went to Chrysler with the same title, he's become synonymous with
Chrysler.
   Iacocca's contract with Chrysler runs through 1991 and he isn't
saying whether he'll stick around thereafter, or want to.
   ``I've got to do a lot in the next 2{ years,'' he said. ``I
always thought that compared with the Japanese, we put the good
guys out _ 65 and over. That's when they're just coming into their
own in Japan. I thing it is stupid the way we take assets and throw
them out.''
   Besides salary, bonuses and stock-option rights, Iacocca will
receive 225,000 shares of Chrysler common stock in 1990 and 1991
worth, at today's prices, about $6 million.
   He has withstood the wrath of the United Auto Workers union and
others in the past for multimillion-dollar annual earnings that
critics have called obscene and unjustified. The chairman not only
hasn't apologized, he's called his compensation the prize that
comes with the task of saving a big company.
   There is little Iacocca won't do to create a friendly image for
himself and Chrysler.
   He's appeared in television ads, did a guest spot on ``Miami
Vice'' and said in newspaper ads: ``Did we screw up? You bet we
did'' when the federal government nailed the company for odometer
fraud.
   His personal life has snared attention too. He was involved in a
well-publicized divorce from his second wife, Peggy, whom he
married after the death of his first wife, Mary. He nearly was
drafted for president in 1988 and, in perhaps one of the proudest
efforts by the son of Italian immigrants, Iacocca spearheaded the
restoration of the Statue of Liberty.
   Like many of his other projects, controversy swirled around the
multimillion dollar rejuvenation of America's freedom symbol in New
York harbor.
   Like other ventures, Iacocca said he learned from it. In four
years of the project, Iacocca became fed up with the infighting and
red tape obstacles lobbed at him by Washington bureaucrats.
   ``I decided, `How would you like to go down there and do that
for a living on everything?' So maybe it's the best lesson I ever
got,'' he said. ``If it hadn't, maybe I'd have been stupid enough
to run for president.''

   The dollar sank Wednesday in response to more
signs that the Federal Reserve was loosening credit and speculation
of continued sluggish economic growth.
   The dollar lost about 1{ Japanese yen and 1{ West German
pfennigs while the cost of a British pound in dollars rose 2 cents.
   The Federal Reserve failed for a second day to drain reserves
from the banking system, an indication it was seeking to lower
interest rates and stimulate the economy.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell sharply to 8{ percent from 91-16 percent on Tuesday.
However, dealers said the sharp drop was mainly the result of
window-dressing by major banks at the end of the two-week
settlement period, when they report their balance sheets to the Fed.
   There was also speculation that Thursday's report on
second-quarter gross national product, and subsequent reports,
would confirm evidence of slow growth, said John Lynam, a vice
president in the New York office of Security Pacific National Bank.
   Britain's pound sterling was boosted by a report that the
nation's trade gap grew less than expected in June.
   The pound climbed in London to $1.6455, compared to $1.6255 late
Tuesday. In New York the pound rose further to $1.6585 from $1.6385
on Tuesday.
   In Tokyo the dollar fell to 141.43 Japanese yen from 142.35 yen
on Tuesday. Later in Europe the dollar closed at 140.50 yen. In New
York the dollar fell to 140.08 yen from 141.55 on Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8835; 1.6060
Swiss francs, down from 1.6202; 1.1837 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1874; 6.3255 French francs, down from 6.3830; and 1,342 Italian
lire, down from 1,357.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
1.6115 Swiss francs, down from 1.6300; 6.3475 French francs, down
from 6.4265; 2.1190 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1348; 1,352.50
Italian lire, down from 1,364.00; 1.1872 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1876.
   Gold traded at a bid price of $373.25 a troy ounce in London
late Wednesday, up from $372.25 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold finished at $374.50, up from $371.25 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to a closing bid of
$372.44.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $374.90 an ounce from $373.70 on Tuesday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $374.10 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $373 an ounce on Tuesday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.22 a troy
ounce, up from $5.20 bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.224 an ounce from $5.208
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Slips To 5{-Month Low As Bearishness Builds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices slipped to a 5{-month low on the New
York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the fourth straight day of
declining prices in a market weakened by slack demand for gasoline
and a dearth of bullish factors.
   On other markets, precious metals advanced; grains and soybeans
were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents lower to 3
cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $18.30
a barrel, the lowest near-month settlement since March 7. Heating
oil futures finished .07 cent to .17 cent higher with August at
49.49 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .43 cent to .84 cent
lower with August at 51.34 cents a gallon.
   Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report, which
showed a 1.4-million-barrel drawdown in U.S. supplies of crude, was
initially perceived as slightly supportive.
   But analysts said closer examination of the report showed an
increase of more than 3 million barrels in the Gulf Coast region,
an indication that demand for gasoline is not keeping pace with
crude-oil production.
   The report also showed overall gasoline production running at a
rate of 7.3 million barrels a day.
   ``That's a lot, especially given that demand seems to be
slacking off a bit,'' said Jerry Samuels, an analyst in New York
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The factors that contributed to a sharp rise in oil prices
earlier this year _ OPEC production cutbacks, tightening supplies
and labor tensions in the North Sea oilfields _ have faded or been
overshadowed by the downturn in gasoline demand, and traders are
increasingly prone to selling as the market moves lower.
   Crude oil for September delivery traded as low as $18.27 on
Tuesday. Analysts said a drop below $18.25 would likely spark a new
round of heavy selling.
   Gold and silver futures advanced slightly on New York's
Commodity Exchange in reaction to a weaker dollar. Gold settled 90
cents to $1.20 higher with August at $375 a troy ounce; silver was
1.5 cents to 1.6 cents higher with September at $5.275 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures prices rose while corn and soybean futures
finished narrowly mixed in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Analysts attributed much of the buying to perceptions that
prices were exaggeratedly low after recent declines.
   Selling in the corn and soybean pits was based largely on ideas
that recent rains in the Midwest had improved crop conditions.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of exchange floor operations with Balfour
Maclaine Corp., a futures brokerage firm, said that with more than
half the corn crop now past the sensitive pollination phase,
traders had begun to shift their focus to the soybean crop, which
is nearing its critical flowering and pod-setting stage.
   ``It'll be pretty difficult to damage the corn crop from here on
in but weather can still be an important factor for the beans,''
Zusel said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with September at $3.88\
a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to } cent higher with September at
$2.29{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with September
at $1.42} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to } cent higher
with August at $6.61} a bushel.
   Pork belly futures made new life-of-contract lows across the
board on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting lower prices
for fresh bellies, deteriorating demand and increased production.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .40 cent higher with
August at 72.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to
.30 cent higher with August at 83.52 cents a pound; live hogs were
.18 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 45.92 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to .85 cent lower with
August at 27.10 cents a pound.

<HEAD>A Snake in Chrysler's Future?</HEAD>

   Chrysler Corp. executives and
engineers are wondering if there is a Viper in the company's
future, an executive said Wednesday.
   A key element in whether the Viper _ a muscular two-seater
sports car _ ever sees the showroom floor could be a new
computer-aided design system, which Chrysler says slashes the time
between design and assembly.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker plans to announce within six months
if it will produce the Viper, which snared a lot of attention on
this winter's car-show circuit.
   The car, a low, sleek sports car billed as having a big V-10
engine, could come to production in as little as a year and a half,
said Thomas Gale, Chrysler's vice president for product design.
   The Viper introduced at the winter auto shows was a devoid of
the pricey electronics loaded into other two-seaters such as the
Nissan 300ZX. Mazda recently used a similar concept for its
low-priced, limited production Miata convertible, which has been
met with torrid demand.
   Gale supports the Viper. Chrysler Motors Corp. President Robert
Lutz wants to build it and Chairman Lee Iacocca said in a recent
interview that he leaned toward producing the car.
   ``Even the bean-counters here are saying we've got to find a way
to build it,'' Iacocca said.
   But there's a roadblock to the Viper _ timing.
   Chrysler is developing an array of engines and a new car
platform for the 1990s. But before then, Chrysler officials are
predicting a softening of the auto market.
   That could force Chrysler and other automakers to look more
toward their bread-and-butter cars and away from anything exotic,
like the Viper.
   One way to pare costs of developing a new vehicle like the Viper
and to make it more attractive to executives is to cut the time
between the drawing board and assembly line.
   Gale said Wednesday a newly installed computer-driven design
tool could slice design time from about a year to eight months.
While it was impossible to tell now, it could cut as much as 25
percent off the time to bring a totally new car to market, dropping
the period to three years, he said.
   The tool, called the conceptual design and rendering system,
began work at Chrysler's studios late last month. Its first project
was the Viper.
   Like other computers, the system gives a designer a computer
generated, three-dimensional depiction of a car. The roof line or
the shape of windows and doors can be changed on the screen, saving
modeling time.
   The difference with the new system, Gale said, is that it also
includes specific mathematical measurements that can be translated
by a machine used to cut a full-size clay model.
   The mathematical information also can be sent to other computers
in engineering and manufacturing divisions, where feasibility
studies can be performed quickly and changes can be recommended.
   For example, if an engineer looks at a design and determines
that it won't work because of aerodynamics, the computer model can
be returned to the design studio for alterations.
   The system was developed by Evans &amp; Sutherland of Salt Lake
City. The company has talked about the system to other companies,
including Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., said E&amp;S
Chairman David C. Evans.
   ``In the past, it's been a little like a relay race,'' Gale said
of the process, in which the designer gave plans to an engineer who
altered them and sent them to a manufacturer to determine if
tooling could be made to assemble the vehicle.
   ``We're changing the way the race is run,'' Gale said.

<HEAD>Xerox Sells a Lot of Copiers, Even More Paper</HEAD>

   The next time the office copier breaks,
jams or refuses to cooperate, pause a moment before delivering that
swift kick to the machine's side.
   You may want to aim your frustration at the paper, the more
likely cause of your grief.
   The paper that goes into the copier, and some times doesn't come
out, probably is responsible for more repair visits by copier
technicians than anything else.
   ``It's the biggest problem because it's the one thing no one has
control over,'' said Robert Sostilio, a copier industry analyst at
Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-based market research company.
   He said virtually every copier manufacturer sells its own brand
of paper to ensure smooth copier performance. Dozens of other
companies also peddle copier paper.
   ``The problem is what's good in Miami may not be good in
Minnesota. And what's good on a machine that makes eight copies a
minute may be miserable on a machine that makes 100 copies a
minute,'' Sostilio said.
   Enter Xerox Corp., the leading seller of copiers, and its Paper
Technology Division, where paper scientists work at engineering
what the company claims is the finest copier paper in the world.
   They expose paper to oppressive humidity, mile-high altitudes
and meticulous examination. They say things like, ``There's a whole
anatomy to a piece of paper.''
   Xerox is the leading distributor of cut-sheet copy paper and the
only company that sells copy paper worldwide. Last year, the
company sold more than 600,000 tons.
   However, the company's stronghold is under attack, partly
because of new technology that Xerox actually invented in 1977.
   It's called the laser printer, a machine that, in many ways, is
similar to a copier.
   A laser printer uses a concentrated beam of light to convert
electronic data into a printed document. A copier uses a flash of
light, mirrors and lenses to reproduce an existing document.
   Many paper suppliers and copier makers have started selling
paper, at a slightly higher price, that's designed specifically for
use in laser printers, and Xerox has taken exception.
   ``You don't need special paper for a laser printer. That's not
how people should be making their decisions about what paper to
use,'' said Stephen Galloway, business planning manager for Xerox's
paper operation.
   The company recently redesigned storage cartons, package
wrappers and ream-end labels to emphasize their multi-purpose
applications. The package now says, ``The most versatile paper you
can use, from copying to electronic printing.''
   ``You can use any one of our papers in any machine. That's what
we want people to know,'' Galloway said. ``So if you're sending out
an inter-office memo and printing it on a laser prnter, there's no
reason to use more expensive paper. Use basic copy paper.''
   Xerox says it goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure paper
quality.
   Paper-checkers riffle through sample reams of shipments from
paper plants around the world, scrutinizing possible defects, dirt
and dust.
   Xerox uses all kinds of paper manufacturers, from a small mill
in Portugal to some of the largest mills in Japan and the United
States, and every supplier must meet the same specifications.
   ``Probably the most elegant paper is made in Switzerland. Egypt
probably produces the poorest locally produced paper,'' said
Dominic Sherony, manager of paper and special products.
   The company has about 50 major suppliers and hundreds of minor
suppliers, who must undergo an approval process that can take up to
three years.
   Paper scientists like Gary Chapin and John Viavattine use all
kinds of measuring devices to determine how smooth it is.
   ``Unless you analytically examine a piece of our paper, you
probably wouldn't know why it's the optimal paper for copiers,''
said Viavattine, as he turned on a machine he designed that
collects dust from cartons of paper.
   Paper dust in copiers is the latest ``paper problem'' Viavattine
and Chapin have been trying to solve.
   Because today's copiers can spit out 135 copies a minute, and in
many places they're running around the clock, Xerox has found that
the accumulation of dust has become a major problem.
   ``Xerox spends more money on service calls just going out and
vacuuming out machines. All because of dust,'' said Viavattine.
   The company is examining ways of improving the way its suppliers
cut the sheets of paper at the mill as one way of trimming dust
from a ream of paper.
   The paper laboratory also includes devices that can peel four
very thin layers from a single sheet of paper, measure the
roughness of a piece of paper or what kind of wood it's made from.
   ``You probably didn't know that paper has a top and a bottom,''
Viavattine said. ``But it does and that's important. That's why we
put arrows on the package to make sure people load the paper
correctly.''

   Gasoline futures prices resumed their recent
slide Wednesday, putting downward pressure on the crude market,
while heating oil futures rose.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for
unleaded gasoline fell another 0.73 cent to close at 51.34 cents a
gallon after falling 1.09 cents on Tuesday. The September contract
lost 0.84 cent and contracts for delivery latr in the year posted
similar declines.
   West Texas Intermediate for September delivery slid 24 cents to
finish at $18.30 a barrel after a drop of 20 cents in the previous
session. Oil prices have declined steadily in the last seven
sessions, with the near-term contract falling $2.15 since July 17.
   Contracts for delivery after September had smaller declines.
   Domestic heating oil for August delivery, meanwhile, rose 0.7
cent to 49.49 cents a gallon, and other contracts also gained.
   Gasoline prices began deteriorating last week after an American
Petroleum Institute report that showed inventories were building,
reflecting a softening in demand, according to analysts.
   Although this week's lower API statistics were perceived by many
traders as bullish for the market, selling of gasoline futures
remained strong.
   ``The market didn't like gasoline even with with lower stocks,''
said Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``Even though they were down they were still well above a year ago,
although last year they were at an all-time low. The perception in
the market is that they still might be too high.''
   Gasoline supplies fell by 1.5 million barrels to 221.3 million
barrels in the week ending July 21, according to the API report.
Inventories remained 13.4 million barrels ahead of last year,
however.
   The API report also showed crude oil stocks fell 1.4 million
barrels to 330.5 million in the week and were down by 19.2 million
barrels over last year.
   Heating oil inventories were down by 800,000 barrels to 109.4
million for the week and by 7.8 million from last year.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said falling gasoline prices continued
to put pressure on the crude market. The API report, he said, was
considered neutral for the market.
   In addition, he said, reports that some members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are still producing
above expectations, are keeping crude prices soft.

   A late buying wave buoyed blue chip stocks,
carrying the Dow Jones industrial average back above the 2,600-mark
as the market moved broadly higher Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged ahead by 29.97 to
a new post-crash high of 2,613.05, benefiting from futures-related
buying programs.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 981 up, 483
down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board expanded to 188.27 million
shares from 179.27 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 225.72 million shares.
   The market rode a see-saw during much of the session with the
Dow industrials reversing course several times while, in the
broader market, losing and gaining issues swapped the lead a few
times.
   But an afternoon outburst of enthusiasm for potential takeover
targets plus program trading set the market on an upward course and
more than compensated for continuing weakness in technology stocks.
   One of the biggest beneficiaries of the takeover speculation was
Disney, which leaped 5] to 109}. Following Paramount's unsuccessful
bid for Time, there was talk that the communications company might
turn its attention to Disney.
   Other media and entertainment companies also were bid higher on
the theory that they might attract Paramount's interest. Tribune
spurted 2{ to 60\, McGraw-Hill gained 1~ to 75\ and MCA went up 3]
to 67.
   Airline stocks took off on takeover speculation also. UAL,
parent of United Airlines, rose 1 to 184{, Delta jumped 1| to 72\
and AMR rose 1~ to 68|.
   Investors also were encouraged to buy consumer companies by a
good earnings report from Pepsico, which rose 1{ to 59. Other big
winners among consumer stocks included Philip Morris, up 6] to
156~, Ralston Purina, up 4 to 99{, American Brands, up 3 to 77[,
Gerber, up 4} to 89|.
   Procter &amp; Gamble added 1} to 119[ and helpd push aloft the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, International Business Machines
lagged, posting a loss of \ to 112{ amid disappointment that the
computer giant was forced to delay a major new product announcement
due to last-minute technical problems.
   IBM also had suffered during a general selloff in technology
stocks that began Tuesday on news of a bearish forecast for the
personal computer industry. Thomas Czech, chairman of the
investment committee at Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi, said stocks might have
gotten a lift from a decline Thursday in the dollar's value against
other major currencies.
   ``Maybe we lifted some recession fears today with the dollar
coming off as it did,'' said Czech. ``The dollar is indicating
maybe we'll get export business moving in the right direction
again.''
   Traders also seemed more upbeat about the economy in
anticipation of Thursday's report on the second-quarter performance
of the gross national product which is expected to show slow but
steady growth.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $33.94 billion, or 1.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.04 to 188.14.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index went up by 5.11 to 387.31,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index ended 4.17 higher at 338.05.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.65 to 449.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 372.78, up 2.66.

<HEAD>New Raisin Ads to Feature Michael Jackson-Like Character</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took the California raisins less than three
years to go from classic Motown to Michael.
   That's Michael as in Michael Jackson, who helped create and
choreograph an ensemble of hip, animated clay raisins _ including
one modeled on himself _ for the latest California Raisin
commercial.
   In the new ad, Michael Raisin and six backups perform a
Jackson-esque version of the Motown classic ``I Heard It Through
the Grapevine.'' The 1960s-era tune has been played in styles
ranging from the original version to rock and gospel in raisin ads
for the past three years.
   The raisins _ including a rapper called Brad and a punker called
Flash _ appear before a screaming audience of animated
strawberries, bananas and other pieces of fruit.
   All of the characters are products of the patented Claymation
process from Will Vinton Productions of Portland, Ore.
   The new ad also features some Jackson-like pyrotechnics and a
surprising twist at the close.
   The 67-second commercial starts running on Friday in 5,700 movie
houses across the country. Sixty- and 30-second versions of the ad
are to start running on network television in mid-September.
   Will Vinton, the chairman of the production house that bears his
name, said Jackson had expressed admiration for the raisin
characters while he and Jackson worked on a segment for Jackson's
recent ``Moonwalker'' home video.
   During a telephone conversation in March, Vinton said they
discussed the possibility of creating some fresh raisin characters
for a new ad.
   Bob Phinney, director of advertising for the raisin board in
Fresno, Calif., said he ``wasn't at all interested in going out and
getting a celebrity endorsement from anybody'' but was intrigued by
Jackson's ideas for the raisin campaign.
   Vinton said he taped Jackson in Los Angeles doing a dance
routine for his raisin character and took the tape back to Oregon,
where the clay models were built and manipulated for the ad.
   Vinton has helped create a half dozen commercials for the raisin
advisory board. The first debuted in October 1986 with raisins
singing a reworded version of the soulful ``Grapevine'' song while
dancing in a conga-line across a tabletop.
   The research firm Video Storyboard Tests Inc. said its surveys
over the past two years have found the raisin ads the most popular
campaign on television.
   Phinney declined to say what Jackson was paid for his
participation in the project, saying only that ``money was never a
consideration.'' Jackson reportedly made $5 million two years ago
for a four-part ad campaign for Pepsi.
   The raisin board will spend about $11 million on this year's
campaign, including production and media costs, he said. That is up
from about $9 million last year.
   In addition, he said the raisin board has received about $6
million in royalties from sales of about $500 million in licensed
products based on the raisin characters, which will soon be joined
by Michael Raisin and other characters from the new commerecials.

<HEAD>UAW Vote Goes Beyond Nissan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Autoworkers voting Wednesday in Tennessee were
deciding not only whether or not the United Auto Workers union
would represent them, but also the course of the union's broader
future, according to labor experts.
   The vote at Nissan Motor Corp.'s car and truck assembly plant in
Smyrna, Tenn., was viewed as critical for the union, which was
attempting to organize a plant in a right-to-work state.
   It also may foreshadow the results of the drive by the UAW _
which has seen membership shrink by 33 percent in the last 10 years
_ to organize the widespread, mostly unorganized automobile
supplier industry.
   ``What's at stake isn't 2,400 Nissan workers, but rather all the
parts that are coming into that plant, which also go to Ford, GM
and Chrysler plants,'' said Harley Shaiken of the University of
California in San Diego. ``A loss here is going to make it very
difficult.
   ``If they win, they are well positioned to take on the other
transplants and to take on the nonunion auto suppliers,
particularly the Japanese suppliers,'' said Shaiken, who has
watched the UAW for years.
   Dan Cornfield, a Vanderbilt University professor of sociology
who focuses on labor relations, also said the broader effect of the
vote could be among the supplier industries.
   A UAW victory, Cornfield said, ``could possibly lead to further
unionization of other workers, especially the supplier plants, and
in other industries.''
   It's not the first time that the UAW has tried to organize a
Japanese ``transplant,'' a U.S. assembly plant operated by a
subsidiary of a Japanese automaker.
   In March 1986, on the eve of a federal hearing to set a date for
a representation election at Honda Motor Corp.'s Marysville, Ohio,
plant, the UAW withdrew its election petition.
   ``They pulled it prior to it coming to a vote because they
didn't want an embarrassing vote,'' Shaiken said. ``The Honda
campaign had some problems.
   ``Here (with Smyrna), they've apparently run an effective
campaign.''
   In addition to the Honda plant in Marysville, the UAW still has
not organized Toyota Motor Corp.'s assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky.
   The union represents workers at Mazda Motor Corp.'s plant in
Flat Rock, Mich., south of Detroit; the New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif., a joint venture
between Toyota and General Motors Corp.; and the Diamond-Star
Motors Corp. plant in Normal, Ill., a joint venture between
Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motor Corp.
   Each of the Big Three automakers has been organized for years.
   Intensifying the importance of the transplants is their growth
in the U.S. auto industry.
   Nissan has announced an expansion of its Smyrna facility that
will put production at about 400,000 vehicles a year by 1992. Honda
is opening a new assembly plant in East Liberty, Ohio, later this
year which will add capacity for about 150,000 more cars. It can
make about 365,000 vehicles a year at Marysville.
   In 1991, Ford Motor Co. and Nissan expect to begin producing a
minivan at a joint venture in Avon Lake, Ohio.
   If Honda sells its entire capacity in the United States and
Chrysler's sales continue to fall, Shaiken said, ``Honda may tend
to displace Chrysler in the early 1990s as the No. 3 automaker.
   ``Imagine a non-union Chrysler,'' he said.

<HEAD>Biggest Dutch Bank to Buy Exchange Bancorp of Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. subsidiary of the largest Dutch banking
firm said Wednesday it had agreed to buy Chicago's sixth-largest
banking concern for $420 million.
   The proposed acquisition of Exchange Bancorp Inc. by LaSalle
National Corp. would give LaSalle's parent, Algemene Bank Nederland
NV, a greater share of the small- and mid-size U.S. corporate
banking market and would expand its retail operations in this
country.
   Chicago-based LaSalle National said it would pay $420 million in
cash for all common stock and convertible preferred stock of
Exchange, which owns four banks in the Chicago area and has about
$3 billion in assets.
   LaSalle owns five community banks in the Chicago area and has
assets of $3.2 billion.
   The acquisition is subject to the signing of a definitive
agreement and the approval of Exchange shareholders and regulatory
agencies.
   ``This is the ideal marriage of two financial institutions,''
said Harrison F. Tempest, president and chief executive of LaSalle
National and manager of Algemene's North American operations.
   ``It creates a Chicago banking group that will be in an enviable
position to meet the challengs of the 1990s,'' Tempest said in a
prepared statement.
   Algemene, based in Amsterdam, is the world's 43rd largest bank
holding company with assets of more than $85 billion. It has made
no secret of its plans to grow in North America.
   Acquisition of Exchange Bancorp will boost the Dutch company's
U.S. assets to more than $13 billion. Algemene also has offices in
Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Pittsburgh,
San Francisco and Seattle, and in 43 countries.
   Exchange Bancorp is controlled by a management group that owns
more than 45 percent of its outstanding shares. The balance is
owned by 1,500 shareholders and 30 major financial institutions.
   Jon Rau, currently president of Exchange, would become president
of the combined Chicago-area banks, which will keep the LaSalle
National name and become Illinois' fifth largest bank-holding
company.
   ``By merging the two groups, we are creating a major force in
the commercial banking market,'' Rau said. ``The combination of our
market shares in the Chicago-area middle market will put LaSalle at
the very top of of this market.''

<HEAD>Two Southwest Airlines Report Earnings Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines and Southwest Airlines reported sharply
higher second-quarter earnings Wednesday, attributing the results
to stronger passenger traffic at the fast-growing carriers.
   America West, based in Tempe, Ariz., reported earnings of $3.03
million or 14 cents a share, an 18.4 percent gain over the $2.56
million or 15 cents a share reported a year earlier. The company
had fewer shares outstanding in 1988.
   Second-quarter revenues totaled $238.6 million vs. $191.8
million, a 24 percent gain.
   For the first six months of 1989, America West reported earnings
of $13.1 million, or 64 cents per common share, on revenues of
$471.7 million, compared with a loss of $13.7 million on revenues
of $362.6 million in the first six months of 1988.
   At Dallas-based Southwest, increased traffic helped overcome the
expense of opening two new terminals to boost quarterly earnings to
$19.24 million or 64 cents a share, a 27.2 percent gain over the
$15.13 million or 48 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues totaled
$263.65 million vs. $216.93 million, a 21.5 percent gain.
   In the first half of 1989, Southwest earned $38.88 million, or
$1.28 per share, on revenues of $493.03 million, compared with
$15.29 million, or 49 cents per share, on $395.5 million in the
first half of 1988.

   Walt Disney Co. stock rose sharply
Wednesday amid speculation that the entertainment kingdom might be
the next takeover target of Paramount Communications Inc.
   Disney would not comment other than to say it had no information
to explain the rise.
   The stock, up more than $7 at one point from Tuesday's close,
finished up $4.75 at $109.12{ a share in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   A group led by Sid Bass, one of the Fort Worth, Texas, family of
investors, owns about 16 percent of Disney's shares, but that
holding has been described as long-term and amicable. There was no
comment from the Bass group Wednesday.
   The Bass family in 1984 spent $333 million and took a 25 percent
share of Disney stock to help the company ward off hostile takeover
attempts by financiers Saul Steinberg of New York and Irwin Jacobs
of Minneapolis.
   However, there has been market speculation that the Bass group
might sell its holdings to Paramount, which on Monday dropped its
$12.2 billion hostile bid for Time Inc.
   New York-based Paramount, which built itself into a media and
entertainment conglomerate largely through acquisitions, indicated
Monday that it would pursue other acquisitions or ventures after
losing a Delaware court battle seeking to block Time's acquisition
of Warner Communications Inc.
   But some analysts consider Disney, which in May reported its
profit for the first half of the fiscal year was up 35 percent at
$297.3 million, an unlikely target for a takeover bid.
   Considered by some to be a more likely trigger for the
speculation was anticipation of a third quarter report that
analysts estimate would show earnings of $1.40 a share, compared
with $1.20 a share for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Eastern Drops Effort To Modify Pilot Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines withdrew efforts to terminate its
pilots contract Wednesday, saying it has already lowered pilot
costs and saw its request as a possible barrier to settlement with
the pilots.
   The union, on strike since March 4, called Eastern's decision an
admission by Eastern it couldn't gain U.S. Bankruptcy Court
approval of proposed cost cuts.
   ``They realized they couldn't win,'' said pilots union spokesman
Hank Weber. ``They were trying to use the bankruptcy court as a
vehicle to change the contract and impose new work rules.''
   Eastern answered that its recruiting program has enabled the
company to achieve the necessary cuts in pilot costs. Even though
Eastern is offering new pilots $28,000 a year, very high within the
airline industry for new hires, company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak
said Eastern is saving money compared with the salaries of veteran
pilots now on strike. The company says they were earning $75,000 to
$100,000.
   Eastern had proposed a 10 percent salary reduction for six
months and another 5 percent salary cut for another six months as
well as delays in vacation. The company said filing for a contract
change through the court was seen as a way of finding a settlement
to prolonged labor differences with its pilots.
   However, since the filing last month, Eastern and its pilots
have held intensive negotiations under the auspices of Bankruptcy
Examiner David Shapiro.
   The pilots union earlier this month asked that the year-old
talks be declared at an impasse and the National Mediation Board
take over. Eastern's announcement Wednesday apparently means the
talks could be referred to the mediation board.
   The Eastern announcement underlines the unusual situation its
pilots contract is in. The pilots officially are not striking but
honoring the picket lines of Eastern's Machinists union, which
struck March 4 after 18 months of federal mediation failed.
   The pilots are still governed by the Railway Labor Act, which
requires them to go through federal mediation before striking.
Further complicating the contract is Eastern's March 9 filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, which gives that court
jurisdiction.
   Eastern, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with hiring of new pilots
and under current U.S. Supreme Court precedent doesn't have to give
veteran pilots jobs already filled by new hires, even if the strike
were settled.
   Six years ago, Texas Air was able to jettison contractual
obligations to pilots as Continental Airlines emerged from
bankruptcy proceedings. But bankruptcy laws were changed after that
to require more careful review before contractual promises could be
left behind.
   Eastern announced Tuesday that it is continuing to boost its
daily schedule, adding 59 percent more flights Aug. 1 with help
from sister carrier Continental.
   Eastern, which struggled to fly 100 flights daily in the first
weeks after its unions struck, said it will increase its July
schedule of 225 daily flights to 350 on Aug. 1 and to 390 flights
on Aug. 15.
   The Miami-based carrier on Tuesday announced leasing of five
planes and crews from Continental, also owned by Texas Air Corp.,
to help with the August schedule.
   Eastern has said it can rebuild without the unions and plans to
build up by year's end to 800 flights, compared to nearly 1,100
daily before the strike.
   Most of Eastern's creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court have
expressed approval of the company's rebuilding plans, while the
unions are backing a buyout bid by Chicago options trader Joseph
Ritchie.
   Frank Causey, Eastern vice president for flight operations, said
325 veteran Eastern pilots have crossed union picket lines, 260
pilot recruits have completed training, and 680 recruits are still
in training. Eastern said 107 of the recruits enrolled this week,
and that there were 25 pilot cross-overs Monday and Tuesday, the
most in such a short time since the strike's beginning.
   Only about 200 of the 3,600 Air Line Pilots Association members
crossed picket lines at the strike's beginning.
   ``We consider this as only a dribble,'' ALPA spokesman Ron Cole.
``Eastern gave it its best shot last week, given the huge media
blitz. The picket line is still solid.''

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are investigating the
theft of thousands of microfilm copies of U.S. patents from at
least a dozen research universities, officials said Wednesday.
   Librarians at the University of Massachusetts, Virginia
Commonwealth University and the University of Maryland first
discovered parts of their files missing in late June, university
officials said.
   About a dozen FBI offices across the United States are looking
into the thefts, said Paul Cavanagh, a spokesman for the FBI's
Boston office.
   ``One of the things we are still considering is whether a
violation of federal statutes is involved,'' he said.
   The missing files fall between the years 1968 through 1988, said
Prudence Adler, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Association
for Research Libraries.
   ``There's a very deliberate pattern. They are not going in and
repeating what has been stolen previously,'' she said. ``Each
institution is losing different files.''
   Ms. Adler said the files, which are open to the public, are
designed to help individual inventors and corporations check
whether they are duplicating previous lines of research.
   ``The question we all have is why someone would steal this
material,'' said Prudence Adler, a spokeswoman for the
Washington-based Association for Research Libraries.
   Through last week, at least 2,000 reels of microfilm have been
reported missing from the dozen universities, she said. A 20-year
collection of patent records from 1968 through 1988 consists of
3,126 reels of microfilm and costs about $100,000, she said.
   Other schools missing patent microfilms include Rice University,
the University of New Mexico, the University of Utah, Georgia Tech,
Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas, the University of Idaho, Ohio
State University and the University of Michigan, she said.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. reported a 21 percent drop in its second-quarter
earnings Wednesday due partly to lower production and refinery
slowdowns, while Shell Oil Co. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. said
their profits rose during the period.
   Higher crude oil prices benefited all three companies as did a
steep rise in gasoline and other oil product sales prices. But
those gains were partially offset by dwindling production.
   Texaco's net income fell to $366 million, or $1.39 a share, from
$464 million, or $1.91 a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
Second-quarter 1988 results included a restructuring gain of $225
million, or 92 cents a share, from the sale of its West German
subsidiary.
   Quarterly revenue declined 10 percent to $8.4 billion from $9.3
billion a year ago.
   Occidental Petroleum's earnings rose about 4 percent to $80
million, or 29 cents a share, from $77 million, or 34 cents a share
a year earlier. The decline in per-share earnings reflected an
increase in the average number of common shares outstanding, the
company said.
   Occidental said quarterly earnings reflected extraordinary
losses of $4 million in 1989 and $10 million in 1988 from the early
payment of debt.
   Revenue rose 7 percent, to $5.1 billion from $4.7 billion in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Shell said second quarter earnings soared 61 percent to $440
million from $274 million a year ago. Revenue totaled $5.9 billion
vs. $5.4 billion, a 9 percent gain. The company does not release
per-share figures because it is a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell
based in the Netherlands, which reports its consolidated earnings
separately.
   Higher crude prices benefited Texaco's exploration and
production business, while a steep rise in gasoline prices early in
the quarter helped refining and marketing businesses.
   But those gains were offset partly by declines in foreign
exploration and production earnings stemming from last year's
platform explosion in the North Sea and the sale of Texaco
subsidiaries in Canada and West Germany.
   Occidental's Piper Alpha oil platform off Aberdeen, Scotland
exploded and burned July 6, 1988 in the North Sea's worst oil
disaster. The platform was destroyed and 167 men were killed.
Texaco and Occidental were two of four companies operating the
field, where production has been delayed since the accident.
   Texaco also said its refining margins were reduced by a
softening of gasoline prices toward the close of the quarter and
scheduled maintenance at three refineries.
   For the first six months of the year, Texaco's net income more
than doubled to $1.821 billion, or $7.19 a share, from $734
million, or $3.02 a share, a year earlier. First-half results
included a gain of $1.19 billion from the sale of its Texaco Canada
Inc. subsidiary.
   Revenue in the six months rose to $18.1 billion from $17.98
billion a year ago.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., is the nation's third
largest oil concern behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.
   Occidental, based in Los Angeles, said the North Sea accident
reduced its exploration and production earnings, but that was
partially offset by higher crude oil prices.
   Occidental said coal division earnings tumbled to $1 million
from $3 million due to strikes by miners in Kentucky and Tennessee,
who joined a wildcat sympathy strike in sympathy with a walkout
against Pittston Coal Group's operations in Virginia and West
Virginia.
   Net income in the first half declined 23 percent to $147
million, or 53 cents a share, from $190 million, or 85 cents a
share, a year ago.
   Revenue rose 11 percent to $10.2 billion from $9.2 billion in
the 1988 period.
   Houston-based Shell, the nation's sixth-largest oil company,
said first-half earnings totaled $801 million, up 21 percent from
$663 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $11 billion, 5 percent
higher than $10.5 billion in the 1988 period.
   Strong demand and higher sales prices for chemical products
produced record earnings in the chemicals division, while an
increase in foreign crude oil production helped offset declines in
domestic production, Shell said.
   Maxus Energy Corp. reported net income of $3.6 million in the
second quarter compared with a loss of $9.6 million a year earlier.
Earnings per share for the second quarter amounted to less than one
cent due to an $11.7 million preferred stock dividend. Revenue
slipped to $149.9 million from $151.6 million.
   Dallas-based Maxus, formerly Diamond Shamrock Corp., posted a
loss of $7 million the first six months of 1989 compared with a
loss of $89.9 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 6 percent to
$295.7 million from $314.3 million in the same period last year.

<HEAD>Fed OK's Three More Bank Companies to Underwrite and Deal in Corporate
Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday gave
the go-ahead for three more New York banking companies to
underwrite and deal in corporate debt, moving further to break down
a 56-year barrier between traditional banking activities and the
securities industry.
   The Fed's latest actions involve requests from Citicorp, the
nation's largest banking concern; Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers
Trust New York Corp.
   The Fed said that the three large banks can establish
subsidiaries to raise money for corporations in the bond market,
traditionally an activity reserved to securities firms.
   A month ago, the Fed had given similar approval to J.P. Morgan,
the first bank to win such approval.
   The Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, had signaled
its intention to allow banks to move into the area of dealing in
corporate securities in January. In that decision, the Fed
governors said they would decide in a year whether to allow banks
to sell new issues of corporate stock.
   In 1987, the Fed had given approval for banks to underwrite
municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities and securities backed by consumer loans.
   The securities subsidiary set up to handle the underwriting
activities may earn no more than 5 percent of its revenue from all
these activities, according to the Fed order.
   The strict limits set on the amount of corporate bond business
that banks can do will prevent banks from quickly challenging the
dominance of the largest securities firms in this area, officials
believe.
   The Fed's actions have still raised protests from lawmakers, who
have complained that the central bank should wait until Congress
addresses the issue of revamping the nation's financial industry.
   The banking industry has been trying for years to get Congress
to overhaul the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which separated the
banking and securities industries in response to abuses which were
uncovered in the wake of the 1929 stock market collapse. But so far
those efforts have not succeeded.

<TEXT>
   Relations between the United States and
the European Community have broadened in recent years as the
trading bloc moves closer to creating a single market in 1992, a
U.S. official said Wednesday.
   ``We're no longer talking only about trade issues,'' said Thomas
Niles, the new U.S. ambassador to the 12-nation European Community,
also known as the Common Market.
   Instead, the bloc has moved increasingly into politics, he said.
For example, President George Bush and other key Western leaders
asked the community a few weeks ago to take charge of putting
together an economic assistance program for Poland and Hungary, he
said.
   Niles, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Canada,
attributed part of the change to the community's campaign to form a
single market in late 1992. By that date, the nations want to
remove trade barriers that prevent free movement of people, goods,
services and money.
   ``Inevitably, the 1992 program is going to result in a
substantial accretion of power and authority and responsibility in
Brussels,'' Niles said in an interview.
   The community's executive body, the European Commission, has its
headquarters in Brussels.
   Niles said there has been a ``quickening and deepening'' of
high-level contacts between the United States and the European
Commission. He noted the commission's president, Jacques Delors,
has met three times with Bush in recent months.
   ``We also see a strong will and readiness on the part of both
partners when we have disputes or problems to find solutions,'' he
said.
   Some worry that the European community will set up barriers
denying access to its 320 million consumers to outsiders, but Niles
said the community should be beneficial to U.S. companies.
   But he said the United States is keeping a close eye on
proposals to shape the new market.
   ``When we see things ... that either we don't understand or we
see as harmful to U.S. interests, we feel we have a right to raise
it with our friends,'' he said.
   The United States has ``strong misgivings about quotas'' that
have been recommended for television programming in 1992, he said.
   The proposal would require that most entertainment programs
shown on European TV be made in Europe. U.S. officials say the
American industry's earnings in Europe would be hurt badly.
   On other issues, Niles said both sides continue to discuss
possible solutions to a stubborn dispute over a European ban on the

   Assembly-line workers who once embraced
Japanese-style team management voted Wednesday on whether to make
Nissan the first wholly Japanese-owned auto plant in the United
States to be unionized.
   Anti-union workers predicted a decisive victory for Nissan Motor
Manufacturing U.S.A; the United Auto Workers, seeking to organize
2,400 hourly employees, also forecast success, although more
cautiously.
   The vote represents a stern test of UAW muscle and a challenge
to automakers' strategy of locating plants in the anti-union South.
   The union campaign at the 6-year-old plant has also called into
question Japanese industry's reputation for enlightened management.
   Workers who once sang the praises of Nissan management, in which
the shop is organized into teams whose members rotate tasks, have
charged that the plant is run at a breakneck speed that has
resulted in a high rate of injury.
   Nissan has warned that a union could jeopardize benefits and
plant unity and that the automaker will be a tough bargainer if the
union wins.
   Balloting at the $760 million plant was expected to end early
Thursday. An announcement of the outcome was expected before dawn.
The union needs a majority of the votes cast.
   Chris Shelton, a quality inspector who has been at the plant
since it opened, said he voted against the union and expected the
UAW to lose badly.
   ``If there're so many people happy with the plant, why should
they get any votes _ or at least as many as they need?'' Shelton
said.
   ``I think it's going to go fairly heavily for the workers
against the union,'' said Ken Roden, an anti-union employee. ``Just
from talking to workers around the plant, somewhere around 75
percent.''
   Maxey Irwin, a union spokesman, said the UAW was ``confident of
a victory, but I am not predicting percentages.''
   The UAW represents workers at Japanese plants jointly owned by
the Big Three U.S. automakers but has no foothold in the nation's
wholly Japanese owned plants: Nissan, Toyota in Georgetown, Ky.,
and Honda in Marysville, Ohio.
   The union tried to organize workers at Marysville but backed out
without an election in what a regional UAW official called a
humiliating defeat.
   The UAW represents workers at a Flat Rock, Mich., plant owned by
Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan. But Ford Motor Co. owns 25 percent of
the parent company.
   Nissan has produced more than 1 million pickup trucks and Sentra
cars since the plant began operation in June 1983 about 15 miles
south of Nashville. More than 3,100 people work at the plant, which
plans to add a third model in 1992.
   Labor observers have characterized the vote as crucial for the
UAW, which has seen membership drop by 33 percent in the past 10
years.
   ``Whether the union wins or not, the vote's important because
the UAW remains one of the strongest _ if not the strongest _ labor
unions in the United States because it has complete coverage of GM,
Ford and Chrysler. And these new Japanese transplants _ the
unorganized ones _ represent a threat to that power base,'' said
Harry Katz, a labor relations professor at Cornell University.
   Katz said he does not understand why Nissan so strongly opposes
the union.
   ``Regardless of whether the union wins or loses, there's going
to be a lot of workers really mad,'' he said. ``And that's going to
cost the company in lost productivity.''
   Roden, wearing a bright red T-shirt that read ``Vote No,'' was
one of three employees who spoke at a company-sponsored news
conference hours before the voting.
   ``We can lose things (if the UAW wins), some of our fringe
benefits such as our lease-car program, the 401k benefits,'' said
Roden. ``Those are the tangible things. The intangible stuff is
what I'm most concerned about, the team concept that they have here
between labor and management. We work together.''
   The UAW has estimated that the pace of the production has
injured 18 percent of the workers. Nissan claims its health and
safety record is better than most U.S. automakers.
   The UAW forced the vote, held under the auspices of the National
Labor Relations Board, by getting signatures from 33 percent of the
workers in a drive kicked off in January 1988 with an appearance by
UAW President Owen Bieber.

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. on Wednesday delivered two
747-400s to British Airways, whose chairman said concerns with the
structural quality of Boeing's jets had been resolved.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said the delivery, which was
two months late, would not have a problem with certification by the
Joint European Airworthiness Authorities.
   The group had considered withholding certification of Boeing
planes because of structural quality concerns. The JEAA has
requested Boeing improve the 747-100's metal skin and some
electrical systems.
   King said problems with Boeing planes have been overcome with
``a constant stream of communication between Boeing and British
Airways.''
   Those problems were addressed in a letter last year by Don
Craig, former chief engineer of British Airways. Complaints
included missing fasteners and wrong or missing parts on planes
manufactured at Boeing's Everett plant.
   British Airways has $9.5 billion in Boeing orders. The company
is due 17 more 747-400s under the current order.
   The two planes delivered Wednesday have already been certified
by the British government's Civil Aviation Authority. They will
make their first commercial flights on a London-to-Philadelphia run
Friday.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Earnings Down 44 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. on Wednesday
reported a 45 percent drop in second-quarter profits it attributed
in part to a $50 million charge associated with the restructuring
of its BethForge division.
   Despite the decline, the nation's second-largest steelmaker
declared common stock dividends for the first time since the third
quarter of 1985.
   The company said it will pay 10 cents per share, reflecting its
recovery from an intense steel industry slump, company officials
said.
   For the second quarter, Bethlehem's earnings fell to $84
million, or 98 cents a share, from $151 million, or $1.85 per
share, during the same quarter last year. Quarterly sales increased
2.7 percent to $1.43 billion from $1.39 billion.
   Basic steel activity generated operating profits of $147
million, down 11.4 percent from $264 million, Bethlehem said.
   The steelmaker said it is paying more for alloys and other raw
materials, while selling less of its high-value products and more
low-value semi-finished steel.
   ``Order entry declined in the second quarter from strong
first-quarter levels as a result of customer inventory adjustments,
seasonal factors and an easing of demand from the automotive
industry,'' Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams said.
   For the first half, Bethlehem reported a 37 percent decline in
profits to $149 million, or $1.73 a share, from $236 million, or $3
per share. Sales for the comparable six-month periods rose 4
percent to $2.84 billion from $2.72 billion.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The A.H. Robins Co., whose Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization survived a federal appeals court
challenge last month, said Wednesday its sales and profit declined
in the second quarter.
   Net earnings for the three months ended June 30 were $2.8
million, or 11 cents a share, down 68 percent from $8.7 million, or
36 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $187.2 million, down 2 percent
from $191.5 million in the second quarter of 1988.
   The sales decline resulted from the impact of converting foreign
currencies into U.S. dollars, the company said. The profit drop was
caused primarily by a higher effective income tax rate, it said.
   Robins, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer that sold
the ill-fated Dalkon Shield birth control device in the early
1970s, is to be acquired by the New York-based American Home
Products Corp. under its reorganization plan, which also includes a
$2.5 billion trust fund to compensate women injured by the Dalkon
Shield.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Charged With Using Inside Information From Patient</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist was indicted Wednesday on
securities and mail fraud charges for allegedly using inside
information from a patient to make a profitable deal involving
BankAmerica Corp. stock.
   A 46-count indictment filed in Manhattan federal court alleged
that the psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis, received non-public
information during a patient consultation about an attempt by
Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive officer of Shearson,
Loeb Rhoades, to become head of BankAmerica.
   Willis was told by the patient that Weill, who previously had
left Shearson, had received a commitment from his former firm to
invest $1 billion in BankAmerica if Weill became BankAmerica's
chief executive officer, the indictment said.
   Using that information, Willis allegedly bought $171,130.50
worth of BankAmerica stock between Jan. 14, 1986 and Feb. 6, 1986.
   He sold the stock Feb. 21, 1986, after a public announcement
about Weill's attempt to become a BankAmerica executive, making a
profit of $27,475 for himself and family members, the indictment
alleges.
   Weill, who now heads Primerica Corp., was unsuccessful in his
bid to join BankAmerica. Neither Weill or BankAmerica were charged
with any wrongdoing.
   The patient, identified only as Jane Doe, had been told about
the bid by her husband, who had knowledge about it through his
business dealings, the indictment said.
   If Weill had been successful, the change would have caused
``substantial upheavals'' in the personal life of the patient and
her husband, it said.
   Willis, 55, of Tenafly, N.J., has an office in Manhattan.
   He was charged in U.S. District Court with 23 counts of
securities fraud and 23 counts of mail fraud. If convicted, he
faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the
46 counts. Willis is to be arraigned Aug. 3

<TEXT>
   A Cornell University graduate student was
indicted Wednesday on a felony charge stemming from the creation of
a rogue computer ``virus'' that paralyzed as many as 6,000
computers last fall.
   Robert Tappan Morris, 24, who has been suspended from the
university for one year, was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Syracuse, N.Y., on a single count of accessing without
authorization at least four university and military computers.
   The computer-crime indictment charged that the virus, which
spread across a nationwide network of computers, prevented the
authorized use of those computers by universities and military
bases.
   The Justice Department said in a statement released here that
Morris was the first person to be charged under a provision of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 that outlaws unauthorized
accesss to computers by hackers. The provision also makes it
illegal to gain entry to a computer to damage or destroy files.
   The indictment comes after months of deliberations within the
Justice Department over whether to charge Morris with a felony or a
misdemeanor.
   Morris, of Arnold, Md., could face a possible five-year sentence
and a $250,000 fine if convicted of the charge.
   The law also provides for restitution of victims of a computer
crime, but prosecutors did not specify how much damage was caused
by the Nov. 2, 1988, incident that virtually shut down a
military-university computer network used to transmit
non-classified data.
   An industry group estimated that as much as $96 million worth of
damage was caused by the virus to 6,200 computers.
   But a Cornell University commission, which criticized Morris'
actions as ``reckless and impetuous,'' called this estimate
``grossly exaggerated'' and ``self-serving.''
   Defense attorney Thomas A. Guidoboni, said Morris ``accepts this
event as a step toward the final resolution of this matter.''
   ``An indictment is simply a formal accusation,'' Guidoboni said.
``Mr. Morris will enter a plea of not guity and contest the charge
against him.'' Morris ``looks forward to his eventual vindication
and his return to a normal life,'' the defense lawyer said.
   As many as 6,000 university and military computers on the
nationwide ARPANET network were infected by the virus or computer
``worm'' that the Cornell University commission concluded was
created by Morris.
   The panel called the incident ``a juvenile act that ignored the
clear potential consequences'' and showed a ``reckless disregard of
those probable consequences.''
   But the commission noted that ``it appears to have been an
uncharacteristic act for Morris,'' who had graduated from Harvard
University last year before beginning a graduate program in
computer science at Cornell.
   Guidoboni said Morris, who has been on leave from the university
since the incident, was placed on a one-year's suspension that
begins in September.
   The defendant's father is chief computer scientist for the
National Computer Security Center near Baltimore.
   The indictment charged that the younger Morris ``intentionally
and without authorization'' accessed computers located at the
University of California at Berkeley; the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in Moffett Field, Calif.; Purdue University in
West Lafayette, Ind.; the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command at
Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and others not
specified.
   The spread of the virus ``prevented the authorized use of one or
more of these federal interest computers and thereby caused a loss
to one or more others'' of more than $1,000, the indictment charged.
   Although the virus disrupted the operations of thousands of
computers, Cornell University spokesman Dennis Meredith said it did
not erase any files of electronically stored data.
   But he said ``there is absolutely no doubt that the computer
worm did serious damage to computer systems around the country.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Stock Prices Move For New High in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell in early trading against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange scored new highs.
   The U.S. dollar opened at 139.35 yen, down 2.08 yen from
Wednesday's close of 141.43 yen. It closed at 140.05 yen in New
York overnight, down from Tuesday's close of 141.60 yen.
   Dealers said the initial trading in Tokyo followed its overnight
trend in New York, where the dollar dropped over signs that the
U.S. Federal Reserve was loosening credit and over speculation
about the country's sluggish economic growth.
   Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the
Federal Reserve did not drain reserves from the banking system
Thursday, despite a sharp decline in the federal funds rate to 8{
percent from more than 9 percent Tuesday.
   The federal funds rate, controlled by the Federal Reserve, is
the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, and it
influences other interest rates throughout the economy.
   The market's general sentiment toward the dollar is bearish,
Kawamura said, adding that many market players predict poor
performance in the second-quarter U.S. gross national product,
showing evidence of slow economic growth. The GNP figures are
scheduled to be released later Thursday in Washington.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which shed 23.07 points Wednesday, gained 126.27
percent, or 0.36 percent, shortly after the market opened to move
to 34,642.10, a new high.
   On Tuesday, the market's main index reached a new closing high
of 34,538.90 points before holding back Wednesday.

   The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday
that would boost federal timber sales, impose new restrictions on
lobbyists and take a slap at federal financing of controversial art.
   The measure provides $10.9 billion for various federal land,
Indian, energy, natural resource and cultural programs for the 1990
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, under the Interior Department and
related agencies. Final passage came on a voice vote.
   With the House having passed an $11.1 billion version of the
bill on July 12, the legislation was the first of the 13 annual
appropriations bills financing the government to clear both
chambers of Congress this year. The Senate and House will have to
hammer out identical texts before President Bush can sign it into
law.
   The Senate legislation contains bonuses for energy and timber
interests, and setbacks for environmentalists.
   With a bow to the public concern about oil spills raised by a
series of tanker accidents in recent months, the bill accepts a
moratorium that the House placed on the leasing of 84 million acres
of federal offshore waters for oil and gas drilling, a larger area
by far than the red-lined zones imposed by Congress in previous
years.
   But it eliminates House language blocking the government from
taking preliminary steps to lease several tracts off the coasts of
California and the Northeast.
   The Senate voted 72-27 to strip a clause, sponsored by Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, banning oil tankers from waters where
leasing moratoria are in force. The prohibition would increase
pressure to ease leasing restrictions.
   McClure argued that tanker accidents are far more likely than
spills from offshore drilling, which he said ``doesn't have a
safety problem. It has a public relations problem.''
   But opponents complained that the provision would drive up the
costs of petroleum products for residents of the large portions of
the country whose offshore waters have drilling restrictions.
   ``It's designed to make them sorry they have championed
moratoria and deferrals and not drilling off their banks,'' said
Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   The Senate also expressed opposition to House provisions
requiring federal consideration of repurchasing leases of tracts
off the Alaskan coast in reaction to the recent Prince William
Sound oil spill. Instead, the Senate directed the Fish and Wildlife
Service to study the effects of the spill on nearby fisheries.
   The legislation would lift court restrictions obtained by
environmental groups on the cutting of hundreds of thousands of
acres of timber on federal lands in California, Oregon and
Washington if the environmentalists and the government's
timber-selling agencies cannot agree by Oct. 1 on terms that would
make 1.25 billion board feet available. The provision, sponsored by
Sens. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations Committee, and Brock Adams, D-Wash., would protect
some trees that are the habitat of the rare spotted owl.
   The chairman of the appropriations panel, Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., included new constraints on lobbyists, a reaction to the
recent scandals involving the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and other agencies.
   Recipients of federal grants, contracts and loans would be
barred from using government funds to pay lobbyists who helped them
obtain the money. All lobbyists who help people pursuing federal
contracts would have to report their activities to the government,
including their earnings.
   ``Every senator in this body ought to be repulsed by the
perception that we will dole out the bucks if stroked by the right
consultant,'' Byrd said.
   The bill would provide $170.2 million to the National Endowment
for the Arts, which provides grants to artists and art
organizations.
   But it sliced $45,000 from the endowment's budget, the amount it
had spent this year on a pair of shows that several lawmakers have
said they found offensive. One was an exhibit of photographs by the
late Robert Mapplethorpe depicting homosexual and sadomasochistic
acts.
   The measure would apportion $1.3 billion to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, $231 million more than Bush sought; $408 million for
energy conservation programs, for which Bush wanted only $96
million; and $228 million to continue filling the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve. The administration sought $35 million for the
emergency reserve because it wanted to continue filling the storage
caves on the Gulf Coast at a slower rate.

   SuperAmerica, the retail gasoline marketing
division of Ashland Oil Inc., has bought 66 7-Eleven stores and
other properties in Minnesota and Wisconsin from Southland Corp.,
Ashland said Wednesday.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   The 7-Eleven units will be renamed under the SuperAmerica brand
name, said John F. Pettus, president of SuperAmerica.
   Of the 66 properties, 54 are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
SuperAmerica already runs 73 stores in the two cities.
   About half of the 7-Eleven stores in the deal sell gas and
merchandise, while the other half sell only merchandise. Seven of
the properties don't contain 7-Eleven stores.
   SuperAmerica has 590 convenience stores in 18 states. The
division also markets gasoline under brand names in nearly 1,500
other company or dealer-operated outlets.
   Dallas-based Southland is the world's largest convenience
retailer with about 7,000 7-Eleven and other stores in the United
States and Canada.
