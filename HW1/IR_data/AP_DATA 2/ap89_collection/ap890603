   A Fort Worth bishop has called for
recognition of a ``church within a church'' as a haven for
conservative Episcopalians opposed to such so-called liberal trends
as the ordination of women.
   ``Let us firmly declare and commit ourselves to the Episcopal
Church and to the provinces of the Anglican Communion that it is
our will to be the church within the church,'' the Rt. Rev.
Clarence Pope Jr., said Thursday.
   Pope, bishop of the Diocese of Fort Worth and president of the
Evangelical and Catholic Mission, addressed nearly 1,200 delegates
at the opening session of the Episcopal Synod of America on
Thursday.
   Pope is president of the Evangelical and Catholic Mission, and
he and other bishops in the mission called the synod last year
after the Rev. Barbara Harris was consecrated as the first female
bishop in the Episcopal Church.
   The bishops called Ms. Harris' election ``the final crisis.''
   Pope and other speakers contended that segments of the Episcopal
Church are abandoning the biblical faith through decisions to
ordain female priests and bishops and efforts to relax moral
teachings on sexuality and marriage.
   ``We must do all we can to remain within this church and do all
we can to transform this church,'' said the Rt. Rev. John-David
Schofield of the Diocese of San Joachin, Fresno, Calif. ``If it
will not be permitted, then we will have to take the next step when
it comes.''
   Pope said the Episcopal Church's laws do not prevent the
traditionalists from forming a voluntary association, and he called
for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for
traditionalists to stay within the church.
   ``We seek nothing more and nothing less than to provide a way to
maintain and propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ through the
unchanged tradition of the historic church. ... Society, we
believe, is hungry for this kind of church and gospel _ neither of
which is subject to the shifting sands of this present age,'' Pope
said.
   Pope's proposal would create a voluntary organization that would
allow traditionalist bishops and priests to visit parishes.
Traditionalist bishops, a small minority in the 2.9 million-member
Episcopal Church, say the church has lost 1 million members in the
past two decades because of liberal changes, including the
ordination of women.

<HEAD>Jury: California Must Share Cost of Stringfellow Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of California should share the huge
cost of cleaning up the Stringfellow toxic waste site, a project
with a potential price tag of up to $740 million, a jury decided
Friday.
   The six-member federal jury did not determine how much the state
should contribute to the cleanup of the Riverside County hazardous
waste site, leaving that decision to U.S. District Court Judge
James Ideman.
   The decision came after less than a day of deliberations.
   The Stringfellow site opened in 1956 and received an estimated
34 million gallons of acids, pesticides and other toxic materials
before it was closed in 1972.
   The panel ruled the state was liable because it supervised
construction of the toxic landfill, delayed cleanup activities and
allowed a dangerous condition to exist on public property.
   The jurors also found the state liable for maintaining a
nuisance and breaching its duty to deal with toxic contamination,
but ruled the state was not negligent in choosing or designing the
site in the early 1950s, or for failing to remedy the toxic
contamination.
   The decision pleased lawyers for J.B. Stringfellow Jr., owner of
the quarry that contained the dump and 14 users of the landfill who
were all found liable to share cleanup costs by Ideman.
   ``We believe the implications of today's ruling is that the
state will bear the lion's share,'' said attorney Michael Kahn.
   Stringfellow, 62, of Costa Mesa said he was delighted with the
jury's decision. ``I feel better,'' he said. ``It's the first time
anyone had heard my story.''
   Deputy Attorney General Don Robinson said the verdict favored
the state because it rejected the plaintiffs' claims the state was
negligent in choosing and designing the dumpsite, and that it
allegedly failed to remedy problems that became apparent in the
1970s.
   Robinson hinted that an appeal was possible, saying that he felt
the jury would not have found the state liable at all if retired
judge Harry Peetris, who presided over the fact-finding hearing,
had not refused to instruct the jury on several legal defenses
possibly applicable to the state.
   ``It is the opinion of the attorney general's office that these
defenses would have barred any finding of liability against the
state on the portion of the verdict that dealt with those
theories,'' Robinson said.
   During the two-month proceeding, Deputy Attorney General Barbara
Noble told the jury operators of the Stringfellow site were to
blame because they allegedly failed to follow design specifications
in a key area of the dump site.
   The alleged error allowed toxic materials to overflow barriers
and spread into groundwater supplies, she said.
   Stringfellow attorney Christopher Bisgaard said his client
initially balked at the idea of putting the toxic dump on his
property but relented after state officials allegedly promised to
help build and operate the dump.
   Bisgaard said state geologists erroneously determined in 1955
that the quarry was located above an impermeable granite bedrock
suitable for safe dumping.
   Barry P. Goode, attorney for Rohr Industries, one of the
companies that dumped chemicals at the Stringfellow site, said the
jury decision shifted blame from companies that merely accepted
state assurances the site was safe.
   ``We were found liable without having done anything wrong,''
Goode said.

<HEAD>Jury Hears Cockpit Tape of Final Moments Before Fatal Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An audio tape played in a courtroom Friday
featured a copilot saying ``That's a gun,'' following the sounds of
shots fired aboard a commuter jetliner that crashed in 1987,
killing all 43 people aboard.
   Jurors heard the pilot and copilot groan loudly after apparent
gunfire in the final moments preceding the crash of the Pacific
Southwest Airlines flight blamed on a gun-toting former airline
employee bent on revenge after he was fired for on-the-job theft.
   David Burke, 35, of Long Beach is alleged to have smuggled a
.44-caliber Magnum aboard Flight 1771 on Dec. 7, 1987 by flashing
his employee badge at a security gate and bypassing metal detectors.
   Relatives of eight passengers and two crew members are suing
PSA, the Los Angeles Department of Airports and a security company,
contending they were negligent in allowing Burke to board the jet
bound for San Francisco with a loaded gun.
   The airline, airport agency and Ogden Allied Aviation Services
Corp. contend Burke was solely responsible for the fatal crash.
   Burke was an employee of USAir, the parent company of PSA, until
he was fired by a man he allegedly shot in the passenger section of
the plane before he entered the cockpit and fired on the flight
crew.
   Julian Andrew Hayes Jr., a pilot and former air traffic
controller, testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs using
a recording of the cockpit crew's conversation with an air traffic
controller in Oakland.
   The tape began with the sound of a possible gunshot.
   Pilot: ``My God!''
   (Sound of second shot.)
   Copilot: ``That's a gun.''
   Pilot: ``Yeah, I know. Tell 'em we got a problem.''
   Copilot: (Sending distress signal.)
   Unknown crew member: ``We've got a problem. We've had a gun
fired. Are they on board the aircraft?''
   Air Controller: ``I beg your pardon.''
   Crew member: ``... and we've had a gun fired on board the
aircraft.''
   Air Controller: ``OK. Do you want to go to Monterey? Can you
make it, sir?''
   (Sound of door opening.)
   Unknown female: ``Hi, Captain.''
   Pilot: ``What kind of problem....''
   (Loud crashing noise.)
   Pilot and copilot: ``Ohh.'' (Loud groan.)
   (Tinkle of breaking glass. Soft banging sound, possibly of the
cockpit door banging shut.)
   The plane crashed minutes later in central California.
   FBI Special Agent Joseph Varley told the jury a .44-caliber
pistol with six spent cartridges was found in the wreckage. It was
traced to an Oakland man who said he loaned it to Burke.
   Varley said a note _ in Burke's handwriting and addressed to his
former supervisor _ was found that read: ``I think it's sort of
ironical we end up like this. I asked for some leniency for my
family ... Well, I got none and you'll get none.''
   Ronald Wecht, attorney for the plaintiffs, said Burke bought
about $350,000 in flight insurance from a terminal vending machine
before boarding the airliner.

   While some city slickers may think real
cowboys are an endangered species, cowboy poets know better.
   Sixteen cowboy poets participated in Friday's National Cowboy
Symposium and Celebration, reciting verses about bull riding, the
cowboy's changing way of life and the barren land they try to tame.
   ``As long as there are cows and people eat hamburgers, there
will be cowboys and my audience will exist,'' said Baxter Black,
who quit his work as a cattleman and veterinarian in the early
1980s to become a full-time cowboy poet.
   The poems were melancholy and humorous; John Underwood's had
plenty of whimsy. One verse was about a dream of a scientifically
enhanced steer with ``eyes a big a truck headlights, each horn
weighed a thousand pounds.''
   ``Cowboy poetry is looking at our flaws and foible and laughing
at ourselves,'' said Black. ``I try to nudge that fine line between
good taste and throwing up in your hat.''
   Black recites his poems, which run as long as 10 minutes, from
memory almost effortlessly. However, on a recent appearance on the
Johnny Carson show, he was so nervous he considered using a
TelePrompTer.
   ``But I decided, no, that's not the cowboy way,'' he said.

   Popeye will soon return to his watch
outside a spinach warehouse.
   Pranksters stole the 7-foot, 200-pound fiberglass statue last
month, but an anonymous tip a few days later led police to Popeye.
He was in a ditch.
   A note, stuck in the sailor's mouth, said: ``We deeply regret
the absence of your friend Popeye. We are returning him because he
just didn't seem happy with us. He wouldn't eat his spinich (sic)
so we figured something was wrong. Help Popeye find his real home.''
   The note was signed by a fraternity from the University of
Arkansas, but Allen said he doubts that the fraternity took Popeye.
   Allen Canning Co. has since repainted the statue. The company
also is working on a way to re-erect the monument to spinach
vitality ``that we think will be pretty secure,'' David Allen,
spokesman for the family-owned business, said Friday.
   He said the company isn't looking for the Popeye thieves.
``We're just glad to have Popeye back in the family,'' he said.

   With one flush, Trish McDonald saw her

   A day before she was to tie the knot, the San Jose woman
accidentally flushed a $5,000 engagement ring down her toilet.
   McDonald, preoccupied with prewedding arrangements, forgot she
had wrapped the ring in toilet paper to protect it. After she wiped
the sink dry with some other toilet paper, she flushed the whole
clump.
   ``I just about hyperventilated on the floor. I said, `This is
the beginning of the end of my marriage.'''
   Enter a team of Roto-Rooter employees.
   The workers tore up the front lawn, built a special dam and
flushed gallons of water into a sewer main.
   And they found it.
   ``I gave them all the champagne out of my refrigerator,'' said
McDonald, a 27-year-old flight attendant. ``I was just passing it
out in the street.''
   ``It was a real long shot,'' said Dean Williamson, a Roto-Rooter
employee. ``I didn't think myself that we'd ever get it.''
   Trish and Gary McDonald were married on schedule, May 20.

   Noted artist Erte will collect big
money in Atlantic City, but not by gambling.
   ``I am bored by gambling,'' the master of art deco design said.
   Instead, Erte will exhibit and sell some of his private
collection in a casino ballroom tonight.
   In his suite at Trump Castle Hotel and Casino this week, the
96-year-old artist was signing special exhibit books for high
rollers who are invited to see and bid on Erte's special exhibit.
   On Sunday, the exhibit will be open to the public and available
for purchase.
   The collection includes 50 original watercolors, some up to 80
years old. It will also feature some of Erte's distinctive
sculptures and jewelry and a costume recently designed by the
artist for the new Broadway musical ``Stardust.''
   Born Romain de Tirtoff, the artist took the name Erte from his
initials. Today, the tiny white-haired man, who designs his own
suits and chunky jewelry, smiled when asked if he has any favorites
among his pieces.
   ``They are all my children and I am their father,'' he said.
   But he admitted to some affection for one abstract sculpture in
his Paris flat, titled ``Autumn.''
   ``I will never give it away because it is the center of my
decorations,'' he said.
   The artist said he has created almost 20,000 designs, mostly of
women bedecked in elaborate outfits. And Erte's mind and
paintbrushes keep flowing.
   ``Retirement is to die, and I don't want to die,'' he said. ``I
will retire when I die.''
   Erte, who is building a new home in Majorca, Spain, has spent
most of his years in a Paris apartment, said Eric Estorick,
managing director of the Grosvenor Gallery in London, Erte's
exclusive world agent.
   ``There have been five different owners of his flat who spent
years waiting for him to die,'' Estorick said, chuckling.
   Erte keeps living a full life, traveling around the world to
exhibits and designing costumes and scenery for upcoming theater
productions.
   ``I always make the complete package for a show,'' he said. ``I
hate to make costumes for someone else's setting. If one painter
makes the background and one the costumes, it's not art, it's an
accommodation.''
   The end results are richly colored costumes and headpieces
melding with spectacular background effects.
   Erte said he first started drawing at age 3. At 6, he drew an
evening dress that his mother later had a dressmaker copy for her
to wear. Years later, from 1915 to 1937, he created covers and
illustrations for Harper's Bazaar.
   He never married, yet he has created thousands of dreamlike
images of women, with inspiration that he said comes from heaven.
   Estorick said Erte ``is not only a meticulous creator, but
unlike fashion designers, he is a basic designer and an artist.
Other designers have to bring in artists to flesh out their ideas.''
   Even with ``the foibles of old age _ rheumatic problems and old
teeth _ the fact is that Erte is a discipline machine. He always is
a no-nonsense, hard-working artist,'' Estorick said.

<HEAD>Official Says $1.6 Trillion in Pension Funds Potentially at Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government watchdog says $1.6 trillion in
private pension funds are subject to potential fraud and abuse
because of loose regulations and lax enforcement of federal pension
laws.
   Labor Department Inspector General J. Brian Hyland said in a
report to Congress on Friday that the problems that leave the
pension system open to abuse are much like those that triggered the
savings and loan crisis.
   Unless Congress acts quickly to strengthen the laws and require
the government to improve oversight of pension funds the potential
exists for a ``nightmare'' that would dwarf the S&amp;L crisis, Hyland
said in the report.
   ``As, unfortunately, has been demonstrated by the recent savings
and loan crisis, government regulation of an industry does not
ensure that invested assets are protected,'' he said.
   The report drew immediate criticism, however, from a research
group that follows employee benefit programs and from the Labor
Department itself, which said the pension laws have been
strengthened in recent years and are under constant review.
   ``I think he is very dramatically overstating any problems,''
said Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit
Research Institute. He said that as a result of the 1974 law
governing pensions, ``the funded status of the private pension
system has improved dramatically in each of the last 15 years.''
   Also, a spokeswoman for the federal agency that insures private
pension funds said Hyland appeared to be exaggerating the
government's _ and taxpayer's _ potential liability in the event of
a major pension funding crisis, the likelihood of which she said
was ``remoter than remote.''
   But Hyland, while not alleging any specific abuses, said
existing laws and regulations allow employers and pension fund
managers to hide abuses from the government. He said understaffing
at the Labor Department leaves the government little chance to
catch offenders.
   The department, Hyland said, has just 300 people to monitor and
enforce the nation's central pension law and lacks a system to
detect when reports pension funds are required to file are
delinquent.
   Permissive regulations allow fund administrators and their
accountants to omit from reports information that could alert the
government to fraud, abuse and mismanagement, said the inspector
general.
   Hyland said his and other reviews of enforcement of the 1974
Employee Retirement Income Security Act have found ``a striking
number of parallels'' to the current savings and loan crisis,
particularly in the failure of managers and private accountants to
pinpoint and report significant management and operations problems.
   The Labor Department attacked that assertion, saying: ``The
analogy between the S&amp;L crisis and ERISA is a faulty one. On the
one hand over recent years S&amp;Ls were largely deregulated while
pension rules have become more stringent.''
   But Hyland said the $100 billion the Congressional Budget Office
estimates it will cost American taxpayers to rescue savings and
loans would appear a bargain should a similar crisis wrack a
significant number of the nation's 870,350 private pension funds
and a sizable portion of their $1.6 trillion in assets _ $7,000 for
every man, woman and child in the United States.
   ``The burden of insuring and protecting failed benefit plans
will fall upon all taxpayers, not just plan beneficiaries and
parties, since the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. is the final
insurer of these plan assets,'' Hyland said. ``Unless steps are
taken now, today's S&amp;L bailout may become tomorrow's ERISA
nightmare.''
   Jane Hoden, a spokeswoman for the pension guaranty corporation,
said the agency believed the protections of ERISA, while not
abuse-free, were strong enough to prevent a crisis in the private
pension system.
   ``Most pension plans are well managed and well funded,'' Ms.
Hoden said. ``The likelihood of something like that happening is
remoter than remote.''
   In the unlikely event of a total or near-total collapse of the
private pension system, PGBC would be liable for its assets plus
its line of credit with the federal Treasury, now $100 million, Ms.
Hoden said.
   The agency's assets now total $2.6 billion and are expected to
top $10 billion in the next decade, she said. The government is not
bound to back the agency beyond the limits of the credit line _
unlike its responsibility to cover all insured bank deposits if the
government agencies that insure them run short of cash, Ms. Hoden
said.

<HEAD>USDA Allows Haying, Grazing on Conservation Set-Aside Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is opening up
millions of acres of erosion-prone land for hay cutting and
livestock grazing to help farmers in drought-stricken areas.
   USDA announced the assistance on Friday, saying producers in
more than 500 counties in 16 states currently could be eligible.
   ``Livestock producers have exhausted stocks of hay that were
carried into winter, and they are now faced with another dry
spring,'' Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said. ``So they're
out of hay and short of grass.''
   The land being made available is part of a conservation reserve
program that pays people to take their most erosion-prone land out
of production for at least 10 years and improve it by planting
grasses and trees.
   The haying assistance would be authorized county by county in
states where a livestock emergency has been declared, currently 16
states, mostly in the Midwest and Great Plains, according to USDA.
   Tighter restrictions would be placed on livestock grazing on the
so-called CRP acres. It would be allowed only after a visual
inspection of the land by the Soil Conservation Service to ensure
it would not suffer any damage.
   The 16 states are: Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma,
Texas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, New
Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   County offices of the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service must seek authority for the haying and grazing
privileges. Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said about 570
counties in the 16 states were eligible currently to apply for the
CRP-related assistance because they had received livestock
emergency declarations. Additional counties and states could become
eligible later.
   As of last year, 28 million acres nationwide _ 19 million of
those in the 16 states _ had been enrolled in the conservation
reserve program, which was established by the 1985 farm law as a
way to reduce erosion and trim overproduction on marginal land. The
government paid $1.4 billion in yearly rental payments to producers
participating in the program.
   Friday's announcement is the latest federal aid made available
to farmers facing crop and livestock losses from lingering drought
conditions. It followed Yeutter's visit to Iowa earlier this week
and earlier visits to Nebraska and Kansas.
   USDA last month authorized livestock grazing and hay cutting on
land taken out of production under this year's commodity programs,
but put off a decision on conservation reserve acreage. In
addition, livestock and poultry producers have been allowed to buy
surplus government-owned grain at discount prices.
   These restrictions will apply to the CRP assistance:
   _Rental payments to producers next year will be cut 50 percent
for those who cut hay or graze livestock. Nationwide, annual
payments averaged $48 an acre last year.
   _No CRP land with grasses planted after July 1, 1987, will be
eligible.
   _Only one hay cutting will be allowed, and none permitted after
July 15. At least three inches of stubble must be left, and a
one-fourth of each field must be left untouched to provide cover
for wildlife.
   _Local ASCS operations will determine how long grazing will be
permitted on CRP land as well as the number of livestock. No
grazing will be allowed after Aug. 1.

   The Veterans Affairs Department is reducing
its home mortgage interest rates by half a percentage point, a move
that could save purchasers more than $300 a year on a typical VA
loan of $75,000.
   Effective Monday, the maximum interest rate for the federally
backed loans will drop to 10 percent. It is the first change in the
VA rate since Dec. 19, when the rate rose from 10 percent to 10.5
percent.
   VA home loans may be used to purchase, improve or refinance a
home or condominium and to purchase or refinance a manufactured
home.
   Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said the action ``reflects
continued investor confidence in the economy as well as current
financial market conditions in which investors are willing to
accept lower yields on long-term investments.''
   The department said that effective Monday, a variety of other
mortgage rates also will fall by a half-point. The maximum rate for
graduated-payment mortgages will fall to 10.25 percent; home
improvement loans, 11.5 percent; manufactured home loans, 12.5
percent; manufactured home lot-only loans, 12 percent; and
manufactured home and lot loans, 12 percent.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Capital Requirements to Rise, But Rules Likely to Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most savings and loan associations will have
to increase the amount of capital they keep in reserve, the
government says.
   The increase is required by current regulations that tie the
capital standards to the industry's annual profitability.
   As a result, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday that
minimum requirements for most savings and loans will rise from the
current 3.44 percent of liabilities to 3.75 percent at the start of
next year.
   The regulations would gradually increase capital requirements to
6 percent.
   The rules, however, are likely to be superseded by legislation
under consideration in Congress that would overhaul S&amp;L regulations
and require thrift operators to put more of their own money at risk
to stay in business.
   The tougher capital requirements proposed by President Bush as
part of his S&amp;L bailout package have been the subject of intense
debate on Capitol Hill, with differences between House and Senate
proposals likely to be ironed out by a joint conference committee.
   Under the changes announced Friday by the bank board, S&amp;Ls in
the standard group _ which includes healthy thrifts and covers
about 80 percent of the industry _ would see their capital
requirements rise to 3.60 percent on July 1 and to 3.75 percent
next January.
   Capital requirements vary case by case for S&amp;Ls in the lower
group _ made up of thrifts experiencing financial difficulty or
under federal supervision _ but their required capital would rise
by 0.19 percent on July 1 and another 0.18 percent next January.

<HEAD>Dispute With Bar Over Judicial Selection Settled, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Senate Judiciary Committee Joseph Biden says
the American Bar Association may have too much influence in the
selection of federal judges, a position that puts him in partial
agreement with conservative critics.
   ``In some respects, the ABA's standing committee has become
larger than life,'' Biden said Friday at a hearing of his
committee. He was referring to the ABA's Standing Committee on
Federal Judiciary.
   ``Surely the (Judiciary) committee has over the years, given the
ABA standing committee an exalted status,'' he said. But Biden also
said that the ABA's opinion on judges was sought in the past
because ``cronyism and not competence was all too often the reason
for choosing a nominee.''
   Biden spoke the same day that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
told reporters he considered his dispute with the ABA over judicial
selection to be settled.
   Thornburgh told reporters he regarded an agreement reached with
the bar group last month ``to be dispositive of this issue.''
   Conservative senators have been smoldering ever since four of
the standing committee's 15 members voted to find then-Judge Robert
Bork unqualified for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Joined by a number of other lawmakers, conservative senators
have been calling for an overhaul or even an end to the process
under which the committee meets behind closed doors and does not
explain how it arrives at its conclusions or how the individual
committee members voted.
   The system, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., told the Judiciary
Committee, ``is a moldering, corrupted, malodorous old relic which
should be given a quick burial for the sake of public health.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Judiciary Committee it ``is
no longer appropriate that this one private organization be granted
a status not accorded to any other group.''
   ``It exercises a virtual veto over judicial nominees,'' Hatch
said.
   But Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, scoffed at what he called
conservative concerns over the ABA's liberal focus. He said he had
been an ABA member for decades and ``there's no question about it _
I would put the ABA on the conservative side.''
   ``Who are you kidding?'' Metzenbaum said. ``This is the
hierarchy of all the big corporate law firms in the country.''
   Under the new agreement with the ABA, the group promised to drop
a disputed paragraph from a brochure outlining its methods of
reviewing potential nominees for the federal bench.
   The paragraph to be erased says: ``Political or ideological
philosophy are not considered, except to the extent that they may
bear upon other factors.''
   Far from barring consideration of politics, critics say, the
paragraph specifically opens the door to such inquiries.
   ABA officials also promised to refrain from weighing the
ideology and political philosophy of potential candidates for judge
whose names are sent to it for review by the Department of Justice.
The officials, however, made a point of adding they had never
considered those factors in their evaluations.
   Names of potential federal judges are sent to the president by
senators and other influential officials. Before they are nominated
by the president, they are evaluated by the administration and
investigated by the FBI.
   Since 1953, the government also has maintained an arrangement
under which potential candidates are screened by the ABA, the major
professional association of the nation's lawyers, before the
president sends their names to Capitol Hill for confirmation by the
Senate.

   Susan Estrich, former Dukakis
presidential campaign manager, told graduates at the 111th
Wellesley College commencement to take precautions against crime
but not to be ruled by fear.
   She said Friday that the recent beating and rape in Central Park
of a Wellesley graduate brought memories of a tragedy that occurred
to her in 1974, two days before she graduated from Wellesley.
   ``On my way home from a rehearsal right here, in the parking lot
of my new Boston apartment, I was raped,'' she said.
   ``I cannot tell you why black teen-agers in New York would abuse
and beat a jogger, or why white teen-agers in New Jersey would
sexually abuse a mentally impaired girl they had gone to school
with all their lives,'' Estrich told the 511 graduates of the
all-women college.
   ``And you do not need me to remind you about locking doors, and
traveling in twos and, not taking unnecessary risks. I can only
tell you that after you have done all that, fear can harm you more
than crime.''

   The King of Morocco claims he's
overtaxed.
   King Hassan II is appealing a recent property tax assessment on
his sprawling central California ranch 175 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
   The monarch owns more than 16,000 acres of ranchland with an
assessed value of nearly $3.7 million. But the king's lawyer said
Thursday the property was only worth about half that much.
   The difference in the tax bill is about $20,000 a year, said
attorney Robin Baggett. He said he believes a compromise can be
reached without a formal appeals hearing.

<HEAD>Scientists Re-examining Possible Geological Fault at Nevada Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is taking a second look
at the possibility of a geological fault near the Nevada site where
the nation's first permanent dump for high-level nuclear waste is
planned.
   The department, which previously had concluded there was no such
fault, sent a team of scientists to Nevada last month to review
existing data on the question ``to make sure we didn't overlook
something,'' department spokeswoman Ginger King said Friday.
   The review was prompted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
which raised questions about the department's decision to dismiss a
1982 study that reported the possible fault, said Carl Gertz,
manager of the Yucca Mountain project, the name for the planned
dump.
   ``There doesn't appear to be a fault,'' Gertz said in a
telephone interview, but it's not possible to know for sure until
the department begins actual digging work. That work can't start
until Nevada grants certain permits, he said.
   The site borders the Nevada Test Site, where underground nuclear
tests are conducted.
   The NRC, which must approve a license for the waste repository,
also recommended more extensive study on whether the site contains
significant amounts of gold, Gertz said.
   Any gold mining activity could disrupt the repository, but Gertz
said preliminary Energy Department studies indicated no significant
amounts of any valuable minerals at the site, which is about 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas. He said additional studies were
planned, but that the NRC wanted even more.
   The dump is intended to entomb 70,000 tons of highly radioactive
waste from commercial nuclear reactors and from the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons plants. Numerous sites were under
consideration early in the decade, but in 1987 Congress decreed
that the search would be limited to Yucca Mountain.
   The Nevada state government strongly objects to the project and
has accused the Energy Department of disregarding the 1982 study
that said there may be an uncharted fault parallel to the Ghost
Dance Fault, which cuts through the site.
   In a letter to Gertz on Tuesday, the Nevada Nuclear Waste
Project Office said the 1982 report contains ``strong evidence'' of
a fault intersecting the area where two exploratory shafts would be
drilled. Earthquakes could destabilize the holes.
   The state contends that if the additional fault were confirmed
it would disqualify Yucca Mountain as a waste dump because the
Energy Department's site criteria rule out sites with underground
facilities closer than 100 feet from a fault.
   The NRC raised a similar point, according to Sue Gagner, a
commission spokeswoman. She said the department was told in a
meeting in early May that ``it looks like they may be violating
their own criteria.'' She said the NRC would publish a lengthy
analysis of the Energy Department's preliminary site study in July.
   Gertz said a team of researchers would spend the next two months
reviewing all the existing scientific data on the possible
existence of an uncharted fault, but that the key to ending the
debate was getting started with exploratory drilling.
   ``Rather than rehash all their old data we want to get on the
mountain,'' he said.
   King said Energy Secretary James Watkins had begun reviewing the
project plans and schedules in light of Nevada's objections and a
series of delays in the program that have drawn the ire of the
Congress and the nuclear utility industry. She said Watkins had not
yet come to any conclusions about possible changes.

<HEAD>DC Delegate to Congress Says He's Violated No Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia's non-voting
congressional delegate, whose office personnel practices are under
preliminary investigation by the Justice Department, says he has
done nothing to violate the law or the rules of Congress.
   In a statement Friday to reporters, Walter Fauntroy complained
about Justice Department leaks concerning the probe and said he is
``cooperating fully'' with authorities.
   He also said The Associated Press has ``consistently'' filed
misleading stories over the past six months.
   In declaring his innocence, Fauntroy also said the Justice
Department has ``subpoenaed personnel records that are not in my
possession nor mine to give.''
   Fauntroy, a non-voting Democratic delegate to the House, said
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ``simply must get control of his
agency.'' He urged Thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to
look into the news leaks that have provided the AP with material
for some of its stories.
   The AP reported last November that Thomas Savage, the son of
Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., was on Fauntroy's payroll from Sept. 8,
1987, to June 13, 1988, and that for a portion of that time he also
was campaigning for election to the Illinois Legislature. The AP
also reported that in his election petition, Savage said he resided
in Chicago.
   In his statement, Fauntroy said AP had failed to report that
Savage was placed on an unpaid leave of absence for the 10 weeks
``that he was in Chicago campaigning for a state office.''
   AP's original story on Nov. 29, 1988, reported that House
records showed Savage had been on an unpaid leave of absence for
six weeks during that period. House records that could resolve the
discrepancy were unavailable late Friday.

   His television campaign ridicules his
prominent ears as ``disquieting, even fatal.''
   Known as the man Poles love to hate, polls show he is trailing
his Solidarity-backed candidate by a 7-1 margin in the race for a
seat in parliament in Sunday's balloting.
   He is Jerzy Urban, the loyal government spokesman for Poland's
communist authorities since 1981.
   Urban was the point man for seven years in the government's
campaign against the Solidarity union movement. And he was among
the first government officials to announce his candidacy in
Poland's first democratic elections since World War II.
   In his usually provocative manner Urban, who is now information
minister, is running as an independent. The Sejm, or parliament,
has 460 seats and 161 are open to opposition candidates, including
independents. The other seats are reserved for members of the
Communist Party and its allies.
   As government spokesman, Urban gave his first news conference in
December 1981 on the day the government imposed martial law and
suppressed Solidarity. The independent union movement subsequently
was outlawed but was legalized again in April following
negotiations that also set the framework for Sunday's elections.
   Over the years Urban belittled Solidarity founder Lech Walesa as
the ``former head of a former union.''
   Now he is running for a Sejm seat in Warsaw's center-city
district against Andrzej Lapicki, a Soviet-endorsed actor.
Opposition polls show Urban to be a heavy underdog.
   But the results could be affected by the large number of ballots
expected to be cast by Poles abroad.
   The district has about 140,000 eligible voters, but some 600,000
Poles abroad, including many embassy and government contract
workers, also will have their ballots counted in the district.
   Urban was promoted to information minister on April 17, the day
Solidarity became legal again.
   As government spokesman he conducted weekly news conference that
were televised and gave him a national audience.
   He frequently would mention polling data showing more than half
of the population disapproved of him, but his news conferences were
the highest rated weekly show on television.
   In the first few days of the campaign the opposition newspaper
Gazeta Wyborcza had so many articles concerning Urban that one
letter writer told the editors to avoid ``Urbanophobia.''
   Ryszard Straus, an Urban aide, said of the polls: ``Urban is in
a better situation than other candidates because he is a well-known
person and does not have to introduce himself to the public like
the others, so it is a big advantage. Ninety-six percent of people
questioned said they knew who Urban was.''
   Urban is a journalist and satirist who was associated with Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski's Liberal Party weekly Polityka.
   He mocks his distinctive appearance _ a small man with a
circular bald pate and large ears.
   In a program on state television, controlled by Urban as
information minister, a singer sang, ``Strange ears had he, strange
hears had he,'' while Urban was shown as a child, teen-ager and
young man. Video-writing drew circles around his ears to make them
look even larger.
   In a country where many politicians are rigid and humorless,
Urban recently told a campaign rally, ``Everyone knows who I am.''

<TEXT>
   A divided Swiss Socialist Party
gathered today to discuss an extraordinary proposal: disbanding
this neutral nation's 625,000-member army.
   About 1,000 delegates were to decide the party's official stand
in a Nov. 26 national referendum on dismantling the army. The
proposal for unlateral disarmament is given no chance at the polls,
but the Socialists' position on it could have an impact on the
country's 30-year-old coalition government.
   The proposal has drawn fierce reactions from the Socialists'
three center-right partners in a governing alliance often cited as
a prime factor in Switzerland's political stability.
   A leader of the conservative Swiss People's Party, Christoph
Blocher, has said an anti-army decision by the Socialist Party
congress should spell the end of the government coalition.
   Switzerland's army has not fought a foreign war for five
centuries but Western military experts have rated it as one of the
world's best-trained and most highly motivated forces.
   The Socialists' right wing and trade union leaders were seeking
a resolution to keep the army. The left wing was inclined toward
dismantling the army.
   Party President Helmut Hubacher predicted that the meeting,
which was to open in Bern today, would decide not to issue a
recommendation. That, too, would provoke criticism from the
center-right.
   The anti-army proposal was authored by socialists and religious
pacifists. They collected 113,000 signatures backing a proposed
amendment to the federal constitution saying ``Switzerland has no
army'' and deleting all references to defense needs. Under the
system of direct democracy in this nation of 4.2 million voters,
the signatures were enough to force a nationwide vote.
   Even supporters admit the proposal has no chance of winning and
was mainly meant as a pro-disarmament demonstration. But it has
posed a predicament for the Socialists, Switzerland's
second-largest political party, ever since being officially
submitted three years ago.
   In its platform, the party endorses Switzerland's armed
neutrality but it has a record of being critical about the defense
budget and procurement plans.
   Hubacher, 63, a former infantry private, urged unsuccessfully a
clear position against the proposal, which he called ``a rotten
egg.''
   ``It is an illusion to think we should set an example and
disarm,'' he said in an interview. ``It is not we who are a threat
to the world but the big powers.''
   The two Socialist members of the seven-member federal executive,
Foreign Minister Rene Felber and Finance Minister Otto Stich, also
have spoken against the proposal. Senior party members warned that
supporting the proposal would boost conservative groups that split
from the main party in recent years.
   But warnings have not stemmed a surprisingly strong pacifist
groundswell in the party, particularly among the young and in urban
regions.
   At the special congress, the party's future defense concept is
the only point on the agenda.
   Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one of four
voters might sympathize with the ``zero option.'' Women appear to
oppose disbanding the army more than men, though feminist groups
favor the proposal.
   Polls are not always reliable in multilingual, multicultural
Switzerland. But even the conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung
newspaper in a recent editorial conceded a ``declining trend'' in
popular support of the army.
   Protests have been growing against low-flying combat planes,
projects to expand army exercise grounds, and noise from mandatory
regular target practice by militia members at the country's 2,500
shooting ranges.
   But most Swiss remain opposed to a farewell to arms in the
country where the military has a long tradition.
   ``I understand every voting citizen who may be tempted to use
this occasion for venting personal anger at the army or the Defense
Department,'' Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger was quoted as
telling the independent Basler Zeitung newspaper.
   ``But this time, we are closely watched from abroad. And
therefore it is particularly important to make plain as firmly as
possible that we remain committed to armed neutrality and to the
defense of our country.''

   The man likely to succeed Jim Wright as
House speaker believes both parties are tired of partisan
mudslinging and is pledging to use his ties to Democrats and
Republicans to improve the atmosphere in Congress.
   Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., spoke critically Friday of the
ethics war sweeping Congress in recent months. But Foley, known as
a consensus builder, also praised the work of the House Ethics
Committee, which comprises six Democrats and six Republicans.
   ``The committee has won a broad degree of public respect in the
manner in which it's handled the difficult issues before it,''
Foley said. ``What we are talking about is the use of ethics issues
as a tool or instrument of recrimination, partisanship.
   ``It's not the ethics committee, it's the members on either side
who are trying to come up with some concept of abusive charges.''
   Foley, the House majority leader, said members of both parties
are guilty of using ethics issues for recrimination and
partisanship.
   ``I think the vast majority of members on both sides of the
aisle are tired of that sort of tactic,'' he told reporters at the
Bank of America headquarters following a private luncheon with
California Democrats.
   The 60-year-old Foley said he hopes to restore the public's
confidence and mutual respect in Congress.
   ``We have to reach out on both sides of the aisle to try and
change the mood of bitterness, which exists to some degree, and
hard feelings, which exist to some degree in both parties, and get
back to a mood of mutual respect and conciliation which can, and
must be, the basis of any effective parliamentary body,'' he said.
   First elected to Congress in 1964, Foley has been described by
colleagues in both parties as the ideal leader to bring a
bipartisan spirit back to Congress in the wake of resignations by
Wright, D-Texas, and House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.
   Foley provided no specifics on how he plans to fight resentments
and abuses in both parties.
   But he said he hopes to create a task force to examine issues
like the code of conduct, ethical standards and whether to limit or
abolish fees representatives receive for speeches and appearances.
   Coelho recently acknowledged that he failed to report a loan
from a savings and loan whose chief executive helped set him up in
a junk bond deal. He said last week he is quitting Congress rather
than endure an ethics investigation like the one that felled Wright.
   Wright resigned Wednesday following a yearlong, $1.5 million
investigation by the House ethics committee that led to charges he
violated House rules in 69 instances.

<HEAD>Iowa Crewman's Friend Recalls Talk of Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sailor who survived the USS Iowa explosion
says he heard his friend and crewmate talk of suicide but never of
blowing up a ship.
   NBC News reported earlier Friday that investigators of the Iowa
explosion are focusing on Clayton Hartwig, who was one of the 47
sailors to die in the blast April 19.
   NBC said Hartwig was often despondent and aloof, and that he
reportedly told a witness, ``If you've got to go, go in a blast.
You go quick. You go painless.''
   But Hartwig's friend, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt,
said on ABC's ``Nightline'' that he didn't take Hartwig's talk of
suicide seriously.
   ``The way he described, you know, killing himself would have
been just simply (to) walk off the ship,'' Truitt said. ``He never
talked about an explosion.''
   Truitt said he remembered that Hartwig ``was a little down, but
it was over a year and a half ago. He had at one point (talked
about suicide) but it wasn't very serious. ... I think we all talk
about suicide at least once in our life, and at the time the
divisions were razzing him about how close friends we were.''
   NBC said Hartwig, 25, was the last man to touch the gunpowder
that exploded in the ship's second turret on April 19.
   NBC reported a witness told investigators that Hartwig showed
off a $15 timer available in hobby stores and said that if it were
rigged to a battery it could set off the ship's gunpowder and start
a chain of explosions.
   But Truitt's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said on ``Nightline'' that
he believed the explosion may have been caused by an inexperienced
crew working with gunpowder that he contended was unstable because
it was stored improperly.
   Last week, Navy investigators said the gunpowder had been stored
at unusually high temperatures at one point. But they also said
that would not have affected its stability.
   Rubin also said he had talked to an Iowa crewman who remembered
hearing someone say shortly before the blast, ``Tell them we're not
ready yet.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann said he could not comment
on the network report, and expressed regret that leaks about the
investigation were distressing relatives and ship's crew.
   Hartwig could have inserted a homemade detonator between bags of
gunpowder in the breech of the turret's center 16-inch gun, NBC
said. Navy explosive experts have successfully tested a similar
timing device in a simulation, the network added.
   CBS also reported that a witness told investigators that Hartwig
had shown him a timing device and said words to the effect that he
could blow the ship up. The network said no remnants of a timer
were found, but firefighting may have washed them away.
   Investigators reportedly said such a device could have given off
smoke or made a noise that could have served as a warning to other
sailors. It had been known earlier that the last words of sailor
Richard Lawrence, spoken into a internal ship telephone, were,
``We've got a problem in here.''
   A different voice was heard saying something that sounded like
``smoke smoke smoke, help help,'' NBC said.
   Many sailors' bodies were found in defensive positions, hunched
over with their arms covering their heads, the network said.
   In addition, NBC said investigators found that Hartwig had
written letters that spoke of his death and the destruction of the
second turret. The network quoted sources as saying they believed
Hartwig lived in a fantasy world and told relatives of an upcoming
transfer to London that the Navy said he had not been given.
   NBC said Truitt was heard by two other sailors as saying
immediately after the blast, ``I can't believe he actually did it.''
   Truitt said on ``Nightline'' that he did not recall making such
a statement and added, ``He (Hartwig) never talked about blowing up
a ship or anything.''
   Truitt has asked the Navy for an apology for linking his name to
the criminal investigation of the explosion. Rubin said Friday at a
news conference, ``If the Navy wants to reveal it they will, and
they're going to; he's going to be cleared.''
   Responding to Rubin's comments, Baumann said Friday night, ``How
can we clear him? We haven't accused him of anything.''
   He read from a Navy statement that said: ``The Navy recognizes
with regret the additional anguish press reports from some
unidentified sources have placed on the families of deceased Iowa
shipmates as well as the crew itself.
   ``We wish to assure these families the Navy remains committed to
a thorough and complete investigation and hopes that a responsible
public understands the need for discretion until all the factors
can be amassed and evaluated.''
   Baumann said Rubin's comments were ``the gist of why we're
putting this out.''

<HEAD>State Department Official Backs Away From Testimony on Honduras Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official is backtracking
from his denial that a plan was carried out to link aid to Honduras
with help to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and a House subcommittee
chairman says he will ask more questions about the plan.
   Michael G. Kozak, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, testified on April 25 that the ``plan was
disapproved, at the objection of the State Department, on the
grounds that conditionality _ linkage between U.S. assistance and
any (Honduran) assistance to the (Contra) resistance _ was contrary
to U.S. policy.''
   ``The whole proposed linkage that was included in (the) plan was
disapproved, was not made, there was no `discreet emissary,'''
Kozak told the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations chaired by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   But in a letter to Obey this week, Kozak said, ``I certainly did
not intend to imply by these statements, however, that decisions to
provide assistance to Honduras on an expedited basis were not
thereafter made or carried out.''
   Kozak had testified that an admission of facts agreed to by both
sides and used in former National Security Council aide Oliver
North's trial was misleading. Among other trial documents was a
Feb. 1985 memo initialed by President Reagan and approving a plan
to link more than $110 million in extra aid to Honduras' support
for the Contra rebels.
   Then-Vice President Bush traveled to Honduras and met with
President Roberto Suazo Cordova, but Bush has said he did not
discuss any possible quid pro quo with Suazo.
   After examining the secret documents used to draw up the
admission of facts, Obey wrote Kozak that his testimony did not
seem to jibe with the documents.
   Obey said Friday that Kozak wrote back to say, ``Because I am
responding from the perspective of the department and my own
personal knowledge, I cannot speak to documents from other agencies
or the thoughts and actions of persons other than myself.''
   A separate letter to Obey from Assistant Secretary Janet Mullins
said, ``Information about non-departmental personnel and activities
should be sought from other, appropriate sources'' which she did
not specify.
   Obey said Kozak's letter to him ``seemed to indicate that his
original testimony left the wrong impression.''
   ``His letter, without specifically reversing that, simply said,
`I'm sorry if we left the impression that the plan was not carried
out,''' Obey said.
   Obey said he believed ``there's absolutely no question that it
was carried out. The documents laid out the plan ... the additional
assistance we know did arrive.''
   Kozak's letter will lead to more questions that will be
addressed both to the State Department and the White House,
including questions about aid to other Central American countries,
Obey said.
   Last month, Obey threatened to hold up $700 million in aid for
Latin America unless administration officials concede they misled
lawmakers about U.S. efforts to win third-country help for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Kozak did not return a message left at his home phone Friday
night.

<HEAD>US Won't Let PLO Reopen Washington Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department has turned down a request
to let the Palestine Liberation Organization reopen the Washington
office the Reagan administration shut down in 1987.
   The Washington representative of the Arab League, Ambassador
Clovis Maksoud, told reporters earlier Friday that he had asked the
State Department to permit the PLO to reopen the office.
   Maksoud said it was ``mind-boggling'' for the United States to
maintain a dialogue with the PLO, begun last December, while
refusing the organization permission to reopen its office here.
   The State Department, responding to press inquiries about
Maksoud's statement, said Congress in 1987 prohibited the
establishment of any PLO office in the United States.

   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is urging the
administration to seek an open U.S. policy in Cambodia rather than
trying to secretly arm non-communist guerrillas there.
   ``There is much at stake here and it seems inadvisable to engage
in secret deals, secret policy, secret aid, and repeat the mistakes
of the very recent past,'' Byrd told the Senate Friday.
   ``If we are to re-engage in Southeast Asia let us do so,'' said
Byrd, the former majority leader who chairs the Appropriations
Committee. ``But let us do so only after thorough, open debate,
with discussions of options and the careful formulation of a new
U.S. policy in concert with other nations that wish to bring
long-term peace and stability to Cambodia.''
   Vietnam announced last April 1 that it will end its 10-year
occupation of Cambodia and withdraw all of its military forces by
next Sept. 30.

   A Florida company has agreed to pay $200,000
in fines and $300,000 to settle civil claims by the government
arising from an investigation of fraud involving weapons sales to
the Philippines.
   Harris Corp., which is based in Melbourne, Fla., pleaded no
contest Friday to a criminal charge it aided and abetted the filing
of a false statement by a Filipino businessman convicted of
defrauding the Defense Department.
   The company entered the no-contest plea in U.S. District Court
in nearby Alexandria, Va. The action was announced by the Justice
Department in Washington.
   Harris admitted that its Farinon Division agreed to falsely
inflate to $3.38 million the value of a $2.4 million subcontract it
obtained from businessman Raymond F. Moreno to sell electronic
equipment to the Philippines military under the program, the
Justice Department said.
   Harris-Farinon agreed to kick back $1.03 million of the $3.38
million to a Hong Kong shell corporation operated by Moreno in the
guise of a marketing fee, the Justice Department said.

   Chinese riot police fired tear gas Saturday on
crowds near Tiananmen Square in a renewed attack against
pro-democracy students occupying the central square. Witnesses also
reported at least 30 people were beaten by police outside the
Beijing Hotel.
   About 700 to 800 riot police used tear gas to clear an area
around the entrance to the Communist Party headquarters at
Zhongnanhai, just west of the square. They also attacked students
and others with truncheons.
   About 5,000 troops, meanwhile, confronted and were quickly
surrounded by crowds outside the Great Hall of the People who were
defying martial law restrictions imposed last month by Premier Li
Peng.
   The troop advance came hours after larger contingents of
soldiers were driven back by throngs of people who implored the
soldiers not to crush the student-led movement for democractic
reform that began in mid-April.
   On the west side of the Great Hall, opposite from the square,
crowds quickly grew into the thousands and blocked the troops from
advancing onto Changan Avenue, the main street running past the
square.
   A city bus was moved in front of the troops to impede their
advance. Large crowds stood on top of the bus and inside it.
   About a half-mile to the west, near Zhongnanhai, students and
others were throwing rocks at riot police, who were armed with
truncheons and knives.
   One man, his chest bloodied, said he had been beaten by police.
   Chinese witnesses said riot police also battled crowds shortly
after noon outside the Beijing Hotel, to the east of the square.
   They said about 30 people have been beaten by police carrying
truncheons before the police had left the area and headed toward
the north, away from the square.
   Meanwhile, an official report said three people were killed when
struck by a police car in an accident Friday night. Students linked
the deaths to their demonstrations and called for a general strike
in protest.
   Troops on Saturday moved against students whose defiance of
martial law and occupation of Beijing's vast square for weeks have
spurred a power struggle among China's rulers.
   The military advances began about midnight and ended in
disarray. More than eight hours later, soldiers still straggled
away from the city center to the outskirts, where about 200,000
soldiers were reportedly camped.
   Soldiers advanced down Changan Avenue, the capital's main road,
but thousands of students and residents used trucks, buses and
their bodies to stop them in front of the Beijing Hotel, several
hundred yards east of the square.
   Other troop convoys coming from other directions also were
halted.
   The middle of the square remained calm, with the ``Ode to Joy''
from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony blaring over student loudspeakers.
   More than 2,000 people surrounded two unmarked buses, one
carrying about 40 soldiers and the other supplies including
automatic rifles, 1.2 miles west of Tiananmen.
   Some of the people broke into the supply vehicle and removed
several automatic rifles, one equipped with a bayonet, and
displayed the weapons on a table set up on top of the bus.
   A banner draped on the bus read, ``These are the angels of peace
sent by Li Peng government to protect the people of the capital.''
   The crowd alternately cheered and jeered the soldiers as they
moved away from the square. Shouts of ``What do you think you're
doing?'' and ``Are you of the people?'' filled the balmy night.
   Said one soldier: ``If I'm going to die I want to die on the
battlefield, not on Changan Avenue.''
   Earlier, about 3,000 student bicyclists headed from the square
to protest an incident in which a police vehicle ran into a crowd.
The bicyclists turned back when they heard that advancing troops
were seen on the other side of the square.
   Government-run Beijing Radio reported Saturday that three people
were killed in the accident. The official Beijing Daily newspaper
said Saturday that two people were killed and two were seriously
injured.
   The newspaper said the police car was traveling too fast on wet
pavement but gave no other details. Witnesses said the accident
occurred at about 11 p.m. Friday.
   They were not the first deaths linked to the demonstrations. It
was reported about two weeks ago that a soldier was killed in a
traffic accident involving troop movements connected to the
protests.
   The Beijing Independent Student Union, in an announcement on the
square, called for a general strike and a demonstration later
Saturday to protest the deaths.
   About 300,000 people crowded into Tiananmen Square on Friday
evening when Ho Te-chien, a singer from Taiwan who defected to
China in 1983, and three others began a hunger strike atop the
martyrs' monument in support of the students' 6-week campaign for
democratic reforms.
   Li declared martial law on May 20 to quell the burgeoning
student-led protest movement, but the declaration only triggered
greater support for the students.
   The number of student protests inside the square had declined
dramatically in the past week, with about 10,000 maintaining a
round-the-clock vigil. But Friday evening, huge masses again
converged on the plaza, the symbolic heart of China.
   The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinary
citizens, are demanding more democracy, an end to official
corruption.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who advocated
concessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and is
under house arrest.

<HEAD>Radical Environmental Group Has Uncompromising Philosophy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1980, five ardent U.S. environmentalists
went on a hiking and camping trip into the Pinacate mountains of
Sonora, Mexico.
   When they returned, they had founded a radical activist movement
_ Earth First! _ epitomized by a no-holds-barred slogan: ``No
compromise in the defense of Mother Earth!''
   With a clenched fist as its logo, Earth First! mounted
letter-writing efforts, staged protests, filed suits, made threats
and used theatrical and guerrilla tactics in a variety of battles
against developers and the lumber and oil industries.
   The group has no formal structure, no official leaders, no
officeholders, no dues, no bureaucracy. Just committed supporters.
   It has about 50 chapters worldwide, including the Korago Tribe
in the Solomon Islands of the southwest Pacific where tribesmen
burned a logging camp to the ground several years ago.
   Members adhere to the uncompromising philosophy espoused by the
most highly profiled of its founders, David Foreman of Tucson, who
was arraigned Friday before a federal magistrate and charged with
conspiracy to sabotage nuclear facilities in Arizona, California
and Colorado. He was freed on a $50,000 bond.
   Three other Earth First! activists, Mark Leslie Davis, 39, Marc
Baker, 37, and Margaret Millett, 35, were ordered held without
bail. Foreman is charged with conspiracy; the other three face a
count each of conspiracy and three types of property destruction.
   Baker, Davis and Millett were committed to attacks on the Palo
Verde and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of Wintersburg, Ariz.,
and San Luis Obispo, Calif., respectively, and the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons center near Denver, according to FBI testimony
based on tape-recorded conversations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Dokken told the federal magistrate
that Foreman was the ringleader.
   ``Mr. Foreman is the worst of the group,'' Dokken said. ``He
sneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader,
sort of the guru to get all of this going. I don't like to use the
analogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. They
just send their munchkins out to do it.''
   If convicted, Foreman faces five years in prison and a $10,000
fine; the others each could be sentenced to 35 years and fined
$80,000, the FBI said.
   Earth First! adheres to a concept called deep ecology, which
maintains wilderness, endangered species and wild plants and
creatures should be preserved for their own sake.
   In a December interview, Foreman said the group's job is to
challenge people to live up to higher standards.
   ``I think we redefined the debate,'' he told The Arizona Daily
Star. ``The media had stopped covering the environment because it
was boring. We made it interesting again.''
   Demonstrations led by Earth First! included one at the Grand
Canyon where members performed a skit in anti-radiation suits to
protest against a proposed uranium mine.
   Members dressed as birds, squirrels and coyotes dropped dollar
bills on federal Park Service officials' heads during a Phoenix
hearing on flights over Grand Canyon.
   They also staged a ``die-in'' at the Phelps Dodge Corp.'s now
closed smelter in Douglas, where members wearing gas masks climbed
the smokestacks in opposition to the air pollution it caused.
   There have been confrontations, such as where Foreman put his
chest against the front of a moving pickup truck in trying to block
construction of a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest.
   Foreman published a book in 1985 titled ``Ecodefense: A Field
Guide to Monkeywrenching,'' which reportedly has sold more than
11,000 copies. It is an illustrated and detailed primer on how to
battle timber and land-developing interests.
   His book offers instructions on such actions as putting spikes
into trees to discourage loggers with chain saws, knocking
bulldozers and helicopters out of order by putting sand in engine
oil, pulling up survey stakes and trap lines, downing billboards,
cutting fences, closing wilderness-area roads and toppling
power-line towers.
   Its genesis, and that of Earth First!, was a 1975 novel by the
late Edward Abbey, ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' about a group of
``eco-raiders'' who unsuccessfully plot to blow up the Glen Canyon
Dam that blocked the Colorado River and created Lake Powell.

   Barbara Ricks finds it altogether fitting
to be shipping millions of books each year from Mississippi, the
state with the highest illiteracy rate, to countries where books
are a scarce commodity.
   Starting with a single shipment to Liberia in 1983, Ricks has
sent more than 2 million books to countries in Africa, Asia and
Latin America.
   Her non-profit company, Books for the World, which has won State
Department praise, operates from Yazoo City, a small town 40 miles
northwest of Jackson in the impoverished Delta area where she grew
up.
   ``Mississippi seems an unlikely place for the exportation of
books,'' Ricks said, echoing comments she has heard time and again
from book publishers, whom she approaches for donations, and from
foreign embassies she contacts to determine which books are needed.
   The statement doesn't bother her.
   ``It makes me feel special if I can dismantle stereotypes _
again,'' said Ricks, a black woman.
   Ricks, who obtained her doctorate in music at Michigan State
University, had completed a two-year education program at Harvard
in 1983 when she was approached by Owen Cooper, the late founder of
Books for the World.
   Cooper, the president of Mississippi Chemical Corp. and vice
president of the Baptist World Alliance, tapped Ricks to take over
the agency.
   Former President Carter has become the agency's honorary board
chairman.
   An estimated 27 percent of adult Mississippians are functionally
illiterate, the highest rate in the nation, and its school dropout
rate is also among the highest. But in many Third World countries,
even the literate often can't read.
   ``If there are people in Mississippi or California who don't
have books, it's not because books aren't available. It's a social
problem,'' Ricks said. At Monrovia College in Liberia, where she
visited in 1983, Ricks met students ``who had been to college, but
had never had books they could take home and read.'' Sometimes a
single textbook must serve a classroom full of students.
   The State Department, leery of publishers who dump books in the
Third World to turn print overruns into tax deductions, has helped
Ricks work in Africa.
   ``We felt there was a great need in Africa and the initial
shipments were very popular,'' said Allison Rosenberg, deputy
assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
   Books for the World asks foreign educators what kinds of books
they need, then sends a sample copy of every title before shipping
tons of books that aren't wanted, Rosenberg said.
   Ricks will take a two-week tour of 18 African countries
beginning June 15, and the U.S. embassies in those countries have
helped her make appointments with potential recipients.
   Ricks said her office operates on a shoestring. Textbook
publishers are approached for donations; corporations moving large
shipments of merchandise are asked to slip in a load of books.
Charitable groups such as the YMCA and World Vision that operate in
the targeted countries help in distribution.
   Her office includes another full-time staffer and volunteers
from a prison work-release program.
   Linda Helms, education coordinator for the Carter Center at
Emory University in Atlanta, said Carter visited Uganda last summer
and wanted to find out how the center could ease the severe book
shortage there.
   ``We made many, many phone calls to people to try to find out
how to do this, find out about the problems we might encounter,''
Helms said. ``We found out Books for the World has already put this
into motion and has done very well with it.''

<HEAD>Solidarity, Gov't Tangle in Election Seen as Huge Gamble for Both</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party struggling to keep
itself and Poland's economy afloat is competing against an
invigorated Solidarity slate of candidates in an election seen as
the freest in Eastern Europe in four decades.
   The elections Sunday for seats in the current one-house
parliament and a new Senate are also viewed as a huge gamble for
both sides.
   About 80 percent of Poland's 27 million eligible voters are
expected to vote.
   Campaigning ended Friday with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
taping a television message and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
Polish leader, delivering a rare television address.
   Walesa urged restraint on both sides and said many people in the
government were worried about the election's outcome.
   ``We are running very aggressively and proposing clear
solutions,'' he said. ``A lot of people with other political
concepts have not seen such a thing before, and they are scared.''
   He said Solidarity and the Communist Party face ``hard work'' in
finding solutions to Poland's economic and social problems.
   ``We are all learning on both sides,'' Walesa said. ``We
shouldn't give way to emotions ... because emotion could destroy
us.''
   Jaruzelski made a similar appeal.
   ``This is first of all a dispute about Poland, about what she
will be like tomorrow, a year from now,'' he said.
   ``An intention to revile those representing different or
independent views, a push for a crushing victory, this is not a
good road. Playing with fire is not allowed. Choosing the road of
hostility, tension and upheavals would be deadly to Poland.''
   In apparent acknowledgment that Solidarity would win a great
many seats, he called for a ``broad, post-election coalition.''
   Party candidates and their allies are guaranteed 299 seats in
the Sejm, or 65 percent. Solidarity candidates are contesting the
other 161 seats and all 100 places in the Senate, which will be the
first freely chosen legislative chamber in the communist world.
   For the Communist Party, the results could reveal an
embarrassing lack of popular support as it begins a four-year
transition leading to democratic elections for the entire
parliament.
   Solidarity could be hurt by apathy, particularly among the
young, and may lose support when it enters the parliament and
assumes at least some responsibility for the painful economic steps
ahead.
   Whatever the risks, Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz
said Friday, ``It is a breakthrough because these elections are an
institutionalization of the opposition, and the opposition as a
political force.''
   Walesa, who entered negotiations with authorities in February
hoping to regain Solidarity's legal status, emerged two months
later with the large step toward democracy in Poland. He is not a
candidate, but he is directing the opposition campaign.
   Jaruzelski also is not running, but the government majority in
the Sejm is expected to elect him to the new office of president.
   During the campaign, candidates devoted little attention to the
grim economic problems, which include probable sharp rises in food
prices to encourage farmers to produce in an environment of 80
percent inflation. Poland's high foreign debt also is problematic _
$39 billion.
   Josef Czyrek, No. 2 in the Politburo, was asked in an interview
Friday how much the party has changed with free elections. His
reply: ``180 degrees.''
   Czyrek conceded Solidarity had a better chance at a Senate
majority and expressed concern about well-known party figures
running for uncontested seats in the Sejm. They will lose if they
get less than 50 percent approval.
   Especially unnerving to the party is the possibility that voters
may reject en masse the 35 prominent Communist or allied
politicians on the unopposed ``national list'' for the Sejm.
   It would be humiliating if people such as Czyrek, Premier
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski or Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak lost,
although they would not be forced to leave office.
   Much of the last-minute party propaganda on state television has
emphasized the ``national list'' includes those who agreed to the
talks that legalized Solidarity and brought about the elections.

<HEAD>Negotiations Planned for Virginia No-Smoking Law</HEAD>

   In Virginia, where tobacco is king and the
crop's green leaves cover the landscape in the summer, a law to
restrict public smoking is almost unthinkable.
   But supporters of a statewide limit on lighting up cigarettes,
cigars and pipes in stores, offices and other public places plan to
meet with representatives of the tobacco industry next month in an
unprecedented effort to reach a compromise over the failed clean
indoor air bill of 1989.
   ``We did agree that there would be no smoking at the meeting,''
said Anne Donley, executive director of Virginia GASP _ Group to
Alleviate Smoking in Public. ``I think it's certainly historic that
the tobacco industry is sitting down and talking with health groups
about this.''
   Paige Sutherland, the Tobacco Institute's regional director,
said, ``We're willing to consider some type of restriction on
public smoking at the statewide level in lieu of any additional
ordinances at the local level.''
   The industry that supports Virginia's leading agricultural crop
mounted a massive offensive at the General Assembly session earlier
this year to defeat a proposal to limit public smoking.
   The bill proposed by Sen. Thomas J. Michie Jr. and Delegate
Bernard S. Cohen would have banned smoking in elevators and
hospital emergency rooms and required no-smoking areas in large
grocery stores and government buildings.
   But lawmakers, pressed by a $100,000-plus lobbying campaign by
tobacco backers, turned down the plan and instead passed a one-year
moratorium, effective July 1, on local no-smoking ordinances that
apply to private industry.
   According to Sutherland, anti-tobacco advocates are ``hounding''
local government bodies to adopt something before the July 1 cutoff.
   On Tuesday, the Newport News City Council approved an ordinance
that limits smoking in stores, theaters, restaurants and other
public places. Portsmouth City Council is considering passing such
an ordinance before July 1.
   About a dozen localities already have such regulations.
   Ms. Donley said she believes the tobacco industry would like to
see the moratorium extended indefinitely. But she said business
groups such as retailers, hotel and restaurant operators are
keeping an open mind.
   Sutherland said complaints that tobacco companies have been
unyielding in opposition to smoking restrictions are unfair.
   ``We're always portrayed as the bad guy,'' he said. ``That's
simply not true.
   ``We're reasonable business people. Our product is legal and it
makes a substantial contribution to the economy,'' he said. ``We're
willing to meet with them and get down to trying to hammer out an
accord.''
   The meeting tentatively has been set for June 20 in the downtown
Richmond office of Anthony F. Troy, a lawyer and former state
attorney general who is a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute.
   Sutherland said an industry-prepared draft of proposed
legislation would be given to Michie and Cohen at the meeting.

<HEAD>Alar Sales in United States Halted by Manufacturer; Move Draws Praise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The voluntary decision by Alar's
manufacturer to take the chemical off the U.S. market drew praise
from the nation's apple belt as the best way to win back consumers.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. continued to defend the chemical as safe,
but said Friday that continued use on apples raised public doubts
about the safety of America's food supply. The chemical has been
labeled a possible carcinogen, although tests are continuing.
   ``We should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of
restoring consumer confidence,'' said John McAlister, a spokesman
for Selah-based Tree Top Inc., the nation's largest apple juice
maker.
   But other industry figures said the action is unlikely to help
the current crop, which has turned into a financial disaster.
   Prices have fallen 40 percent, to below the cost of production,
and Washington state has 3.3 million more boxes of apples in
storage than at this time last year. That includes an unknown
quantity of Alar-treated apples that may have to be dumped.
   ``It won't make any difference for this year, but it certainly
should help us as far as sales for next year's crop,'' said Bill
DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association, which charts
apple sales.
   Washington state produces about half the nation's apples and has
about 12 million of the 42-pound boxes in storage.
   Apple growers and processors nationwide had pleaded with
Uniroyal to withdraw Alar. Public fears had cost each group an
estimated $100 million in sales so far this year, industry groups
estimate.
   The voluntary withdrawal by Uniroyal, which is based in
Middlebury, Conn., means consumers will be guaranteed that this
fall's apple crop will be Alar-free, said Tom Hale of the
Washington State Apple Commission.
   Sales of daminozide, which is sold under the name Alar, would
continue to about 70 foreign markets, including some that export
apples and apple products to this country, Uniroyal said.
   Supplies of the chemical held by U.S. customers may be returned
for refunds, the company said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said late Friday it has
reached agreement with Uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of
Alar from the U.S. market, although it is still legal to use. The
agency also said it will notify foreign governments about agency
concerns about Alar.
   The EPA has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food
products because tests in laboratory animals have linked a
byproduct of Alar with cancer after the chemical is heated. Final
action on the proposed regulation is not expected until late 1990.
   Uniroyal has disputed the findings and company Vice President
James Wylie said Friday: ``We want to emphasize that we have not
changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide.''
   The EPA estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the U.S.
apple crop is treated with Alar, a growth regulator that improves
the apple's appearance and gives it a longer shelf life.
   The Alar issue was ignited by the private Natural Resources
Defense Council's report that concluded that eating Alar-treated
apples increased cancer risk, especially in children.
   The findings have been disputed by the apple industry and
several federal agencies, including EPA, declared apples safe to
eat.

<HEAD>Most Expensive Freeway Segment Ever Built Opens</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With much fanfare, authorities Sunday are opening
a seven-mile stretch of Interstate 90 that has the dubious
distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever
built.
   It is part of a $1.46 billion highway project for the
mushrooming Seattle metropolis to build roads that probably will be
badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994.
   For the time being, the new link between Seattle and Bellevue
across Lake Washington brings welcome relief from the twice-daily
creep across the lake's two existing four-lane spans that become
jammed by fender-benders.
   Commuters also say goodbye to an infamous I-90 lane that
switched direction depending on the commute. With no barrier to
separate traffic, motorists tagged it the ``death lane.''
   The completed segment includes a floating bridge, a
triple-decker tunnel with one level for bicycles and pedestrians,
and a concrete-slab roof over sections of the highway that will be
landscaped as parks.
   The freeway, proposed in 1957, drew the wrath of residents, who
wanted to protect neighborhoods, and of environmentalists.
   In 1971, planners agreed to scale back the project and build
tunnels on the Seattle side of the lake, but an environmental
impact statement wasn't approved until 1979.
   By then, federal money had dried up, and it wasn't until
Congress raised the gas tax in 1982 that funds became available.
Construction began in earnest the next year.
   So far, $860 million has been spent. The balance of the money
will go to reopening and linking up one of the old bridges, located
to the south of the new structure, as well as other additions.
   At about $200 million a mile, the freeway has set a record for
costliness, but one that will soon fall to a project at I-90's
other terminus _ Boston, according to Seattle project manager Brian
Henkel.
   That $4.4 billion project will rebuild Interstate 93 through
downtown Boston and construct a third harbor tunnel to link I-90
with Logan International Airport.
   Despite ``a major crisis every second day,'' Henkel said, he is
on time and $16 million under budget. The project includes the
world's largest soft-ground tunnel _ 1,500 feet long and 63 feet in
diameter _ Henkel said.
   Henkel said he still sees vestiges of the rancor that surrounded
the project.
   ``But now, it's almost opposite to the earlier emotion of `make
the freeway as difficult as possible to get on and maybe they won't
build it,''' he said. ``Now they say, `I live in Seattle and work
on the Eastside and there's no way I can get on I-90 conveniently.''
   King County east of Lake Washington has grown in the past two
decades from small towns and farms to a suburban area of 360,000
people. Another 275,000 are expected by 2020, said Mike Smith,
senior transportation planner for the Puget Sound Council of
Governments.
   The county, which includes Seattle, has a population of about
1.4 million. Studies have shown the population of King and
surrounding counties will grow by about 500,000 in the next decade.

   Brake failure may have caused a school bus
to plunge off a mountain road, killing a sixth-grader and injuring
36 other schoolchildren, officials said.
   Forty-one people, including four adults and 37 schoolchildren
from Whittier Elementary School in Boulder, were aboard the bus
Friday as it went off the road, plunged about 20 feet down an
embankment and overturned onto rocks three miles southwest of Lyons
in central Colorado.
   ``Everyone was screaming, the bus was tipping ... we were going
too fast,'' said Marc Tedesco, a sixth-grader on the bus. ``We were
heading towards the rock and she turned to miss it and we did a
360.''
   Kevin Swenby, 11, was reported dead at the scene. Kristopher
Sieger, 12, was listed in serious condition at St. Anthony's
Central Hospital in Denver Friday night, according to a hospital
spokeswoman. Marissa Burns, 11, was admitted to Longmont United
Hospital, where she was in stable condition.
   The rest of the passengers were treated at area hospitals and
released, officials said.
   Officials said the brakes may have failed as the driver,
41-year-old Mireya Van Amee, tried to turn on a curve on the steep
mountain canyon road.
   Skid marks left along the canyon road by the bus indicate that
it slid out of control for at least 1,000 feet before it went over
the embankment, said Mark Anello, a Colorado State Patrol
spokesman. ``It looks like a brake problem,'' he said.
   The children were returning from a field trip at Highlands
Presbyterian Church Camp, according to Lynn Straight, Boulder
Valley Public Schools associate superintendent.

<HEAD>Catholic High School Recalls Yearbooks Because Of Offensive Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The student yearbook at a Catholic high school
was recalled after officials discovered the books contained sexual
innuendo and insults directed at faculty members.
   Seniors at St. Ignatius High School were told unless they
returned their yearbooks, they could not go to graduation
ceremonies Sunday, while underclassmen were told they could not
advance to the next grade if they failed to return the books, the
Rev. Robert Welsh, school president, said Friday.
   Thirty-eight of the 800 books printed remained unaccounted for
Friday night, Welsh said.
   ``There were unacceptable captions and unacceptable stories,''
Welsh said. ``There were sexual references and there was also bad
taste and rather insulting remarks to the faculty.''
   Welsh said six of eight seniors who worked on the yearbooks
apologized to faculty and staff Friday afternoon. Some parents
accompanied the students, he said.
   ``I would say the faculty accepted the apology. As a Catholic
school we feel we are called to forgive those who ask for
forgiveness,'' Welsh said.
   He said no disciplinary action would be taken against the six
students.
   The Plain Dealer reported today the captions were apparently
written after the yearbook's adviser had been injured in a car
accident.
   The yearbook staffers later showed the adviser phony page
proofs, which the teacher approved, then the students sent the real
pages to the publisher, the newspaper said.
   There are 277 seniors among the 1,200 male students at St.
Ignatius.

<HEAD>Venerable Ice Cream Parlor, Inventor of Hot Fudge Sundae, Tries Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bailey's, the venerable chain of ice cream parlors
where the hot fudge sundae was invented, is trying to make a
comeback under new ownership after a disastrous experiment in
yuppie marketing.
   Last year, five of its seven stores closed, including the
landmark location in Cambridge's Harvard Square, where the mahogany
paneling and marble table tops were ripped out for a pizzeria.
   The 116-year-old chain's former owner, Joey Crugnale, admits he
goofed in trying to remake Bailey's as an upscale spot for people
in their 20s and 30s.
   ``It was a mistake from the beginning,'' he said. ``But I'm not
ashamed of it. I learned a lot from it.''
   Michael Mazzaferro, one of three brothers who bought the
business in November for an undisclosed price, said he hopes to
reopen stores in Boston and Cambridge within the next few years.
   ``I think the company lost its focus and it became more of a
luncheon stop as opposed to an old-fashioned candy store and ice
cream parlor,'' he said. ``We want to restore it to its roots.''
   The Mazzaferro family, which has been making candy in
Massachusetts since the 1950s, already is turning out Bailey's
fudge at the rate of 20,000 pounds a year.
   That would gladden the heart of Sarah Dow, the bookkeeper to
founder John Bailey. When he retired in 1900, she became the shop's
owner and took a gamble that made dessert history.
   ``She put 6 ounces of ice cream in a 5-ounce dish and poured one
and a half ounces of hot fudge on top of it, and it dripped down
onto the silver dish,'' Frank Wyman Jr., a former Bailey's owner,
said with reverence. ``Beautiful concept. Beautiful product.''
   Later, Bailey's supplied mail-order chocolates to Theodore
Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy Sr.,
the late president's father, was among the many Boston brahmins who
kept his candy preferences on record at the flagship store on
Temple Place, at the edge of the Boston Common.
   Shortly after Crugnale bought the chain in January 1987 for a
reported $1.5 million, he announced plans to open more than 100
stores throughout New England in seven or eight years.
   But one of his first moves was to decide there was ``just no
future'' in the old-fashioned menu of sandwiches like chopped ham
and pickles, peanut butter and bacon, and datenut bread and cream
cheese.
   Although ``little old ladies'' who had been faithful customers
for decades implored him to reconsider, Crugnale said, he held firm.
   The entrepreneur, 37, had made a fortune with a yuppie, trendy,
gourmet ice cream chain called Steve's and a yuppie, trendy,
gourmet pizza chain called Bertucci's.
   So he ignored the old ladies and pulled the same trick with
Bailey's.
   It didn't work.
   When Crugnale sold the chain to the Mazzaferros last fall, it
was down to two stores, both in the suburbs.
   Crugnale, who had built Steve's Ice Cream from one store to a
national chain of 26 before selling out in 1983, says he was
probably overconfident when he took over Bailey's.
   ``I thought I was superman _ I did Steve's, I could do
anything,'' he said.
   Though humbled by his failure with Bailey's, Crugnale has made a
roaring success of Bertucci's, now a chain of 12 pizzerias in
Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
   ``Bailey's was a business we shouldn't have been in,'' he said.
``Bertucci's is one I'm much more comfortable with.''

   Haitian refugees threatened to throw babies
overboard during an eight-hour standoff at sea before agreeing to
board Coast Guard cutters, officials said.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service agents Friday were
interviewing 109 Haitians after flying to the scene about 100 miles
south of Miami, said Lt. Jeff Karonis, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   Karonis said the refugees brandished knives and machetes when
their 50-foot wooden sailboat was intercepted Thursday by the Coast
Guard.
   The refugees refused to let the Coast Guard board their boat,
Karonis said, and the group's leader threatened to throw five
babies overboard.
   The Coast Guard cutters Shearwater and Matagorda were sent out
to help a third cutter, the Metompkin, which made the interception.
   During the standoff, the INS agents and an interpreter were
airlifted to the scene.
   Late Thursday, after hours of negotiations, INS and Coast Guard
officials managed ``to convince the Haitians to go peacefully'' to
the cutters, Karonis said.
   No one was injured, and a small Coast Guard launch crew rescued
a woman who jumped overboard during the standoff.
   Two of the Haitians were airlifted from the scene to Miami's
Jackson Memorial Hospital. One was suffering from hypothermia,
Karonis said, and the other appeared to have suffered a seizure.
   The hospital on Friday refused to release details of their
condition.

<HEAD>Wages Down, Vacations Out at Eastern</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wages are down, work hours are up and vacations are
out at Eastern Airlines, which announced an austerity program
designed to help the strike-crippled company rebuild from
bankruptcy.
   Eastern said Friday it will eliminate vacations for the rest of
the year, cut management pay by 20 percent and require non-union
employees to work 50 hours a week for 40 hours of pay.
   Meanwhile, a judge in New York gave an investor group friendly
with striking employees until Monday afternoon to refine a buyout
proposal. The group is led by Chicago commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland's decree surprised
observers who thought he would dismiss the Ritchie proposal as
financially inadequate and vague.
   But David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern,
told Lifland he was impressed by a new version of the plan under
which the unions would risk $175 million to $200 million of their
wages over six months.
   Eastern sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking
Machinists on March 4, reducing the airline's flights by more than
90 percent.
   The company plans to expand service and recall some 1,700
non-union employees by July 2.
   ``It's a unique situation. We're going to be the fastest-growing
airline in history during the time we're going to be in
bankruptcy,'' said Thomas J. Matthews, senior vice president for
human resources.
   Under the austerity program, full-time agents and clerical
workers will be scheduled to work 50 hours a week without a pay
increase through Dec. 1. Management also will work at least 50
hours a week.
   No vacations will be allowed through year's end, and no vacation
credit will be accrued from March to December this year.
   Salaries for about 25 corporate officers, including Eastern
President Phil Bakes, will be reduced 20 percent through the end of
the year and 10 percent for the first six months of 1990.
   The company's proposals for pilots and flight attendants will be
discussed when negotiations with the unions representing those
groups resume next week, Matthews said.
   Union officials said the austerity program proves the company's
reorganization plan is failing.
   ``They're not getting the revenue coming in to sustain the
people on the payroll,'' said Wally Haber, a spokesman for the
Machinists.
   Eastern is operating with 5,000 workers, most of them management
employees. The company had 30,000 workers before the strike and
plans to have 17,000 when its reorganization is completed by year's
end.
   The number of management jobs will be reduced from 2,900 before
the strike to 1,900, and about 1,000 management employees will be
reassigned to non-management jobs, Matthews said.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the Arab world's bitterest rivalries
seems headed toward resolution following a bearhug in Morocco.
   The hugger was Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who a few days
earlier had threatened to boycott the Arab League summit meeting at
Casablanca if Egypt's Hosni Mubarak showed up. Mubarak was the one
hugged.
   That was May 23.
   Since then, invective has halted from both sides of the
Egyptian-Libyan border, now open for the first time in more than a
decade.
   Unannounced, Egypt canceled military exercises scheduled this
week in the desert between Cairo and Libya and is expected to
reduce forces concentrated there since the early 1970s.
   Further, a Libyan aircraft has landed at Cairo International
Airport for the first time in years, with a promise of regular
commercial service starting Monday.
   And Col. Gadhafi's cousin and intelligence chief, Ahmed Gaddaf
Dam, spent two days in Cairo, including a meeting Wednesday night
with the Egyptian president.
   If the drama plays out, Libya, the United States's most strident
Arab enemy, soon could restore relations with Egypt, one of
Washington's best friends in the region.
   On Wednesday, Mubarak told journalists that relations between
the two countries ``are on the threshold of a new era based on a
right foundation of frankness.''
   Several newspapers reported Gadhafi would visit Egypt, some
saying he would drive to Alexandria, 300 miles east of the border.
   ``It would be just like him,'' said a Foreign Ministry source on
condition of anonymity. ``But we shouldn't jump to conclusions. We
should take it easy and not forget that Gadhafi can just as
suddenly change his mind.''
   Makram Mohamed Ahmed, a magazine editor and Mubarak confidant,
wrote that it is realistic to expect the reopening of borders and
airports but ``difficult, for varying reasons, to talk about plans
for the far future.''
   The first major strains in relations occurred in 1972, when
Gadhafi proposed a merger of the two north African neighbors that
was rejected by Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat. The break
occurred in 1977 with a brief border war after Sadat accused
Gadhafi of sponsoring terror bombings in Egypt.
   Mubarak's government has charged Gadhafi with several attempts
to assassinate Libyan dissidents in Egypt, several of whom
coordinate anti-Gadhafi campaigns from their Egyptian exile. It
also suspected but was unable to prove that Libya laid mines in the
Red Sea in 1984.
   Libya still has no embassy or diplomatic interests section in
Cairo, and Libyan dissidents, while not knowing what to expect,
still receive police protection.
   Gadhafi has asked Mubarak to send home the exiles, many of them
thriving businessmen.
   Egypt has refused.
   Libyan exiles had transmitted messages of defiance to their
countrymen back home on Radio Cairo's Voice of the Arabs. A source
at the official radio service said, however, that the station
stopped its anti-Gadhafi rhetoric shortly before the Casablanca
summit.
   In Libya, the official news agency JANA also has changed its
tone.
   On Thursday, it distributed a report of a telegram to Gadhafi
from a prominent Sudanese politician congratulating ``yourself and
the Arab nation for normalizing brotherly relations'' with Egypt.
   And since the summit meeting, JANA has called the Egyptian
president Mubarak instead of its usual term, ``Al-Barek'' _ an
insulting term describing a kneeling camel.

<TEXT>
   Seven of 11 Britons expelled by the Soviet Union
for alleged espionage have returned to Britain, and one of them, TV
journalist Ian Glover-James, called the allegations
``incomprehensible.''
   The Soviets last month ordered out eight British diplomats and
three journalists in response to Britain's expulsion of 11 Soviets
also accused of espionage. The seven arrived home Friday.
   Glover-James, who had been based in Moscow for two years with

``I'm a correspondent, a news reporter, nothing else. I've never

   ``To me, they (the allegations) are incomprehensible,'' he said.
``It's impossible to understand them, I don't recognize them and
they certainly don't apply to me.''
   Glover-James said he would like to visit Moscow again, but his
chances of being allowed back in ``are not very hopeful,'' he said.
``That's very disappointing.''
   Capt. Christopher Meyer, the British Embassy's expelled naval

   Asked about the allegations, Meyer replied, ``I'm not a spy.''

   The prosecution's star witness in ``The
Cotton Club'' murder case testified that two bodyguards bragged
about killing producer Roy Radin.
   The surprise testimony Friday prompted the judge to halt a
preliminary hearing under way to determine if enough evidence
exists for trial.
   William Rider said two defendants bragged to him about the Radin
murder and one of them said ``he enjoyed shooting the big fat Jew.''
   Angry defense lawyers interrupted Rider's testimony, objecting
that they had not been told about at least 10 statements he had
made in less than an hour on the stand Friday.
   The lawyers accused prosecutors of hiding incriminating
information, which is prohibited under California laws. Deputy
District Attorney David Conn insisted he had disclosed ``the gist
of the statements,'' but Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay said
that was insufficient.
   She stopped the hearing and ordered prosecution investigators to
appear in court Monday to disclose everything they know about
Rider's planned testimony. If more material is uncovered, she said
she would grant the defense a continuance.
   Rider, Hustler magazine Publisher Larry Flynt's brother-in-law
and former chief of security, implicated two of Flynt's former
bodyguards, William Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamota Marti, who are
charged in the May 1983 Radin murder.
   Rider's claim that the two confessed to him triggered charges in
the six-year-old murder in October. He also implicated reputed drug
dealer Karen DeLayne Greenberger and former Paramount Pictures
chief Robert Evans, who has refused to testify citing fears he
might incriminate himself. Evans is not charged.
   Mrs. Greenberger, who is charged in the murder, introduced Radin
and Evans in a deal to finance the movie, ``The Cotton Club.''
   Rider's new statements from the witness stand were more detailed
than those he had given before. He said Marti and Mentzer boasted
to him in May or June 1983 about the Radin murder.
   ``It was sometime before the body was found and after the
killing,'' he said, recalling a conversation with Mentzer at
Flynt's house.
   ``What did Mr. Mentzer say?'' asked Conn.
   ``Only that he had just done a hit and dumped the body up by
where we went target practicing,'' said Rider.
   Radin disappeared on May 13, 1983. His body was found a month
later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had
been shot repeatedly in the head.
   In June, Rider said, Mentzer and Marti brought him a newspaper
article about the discovery of Radin's body and said it proved they
were telling the truth. He said they referred to Radin by the
nickname ``Rodan,'' and offered more details.
   ``Mr. Marti said that in reference to Mr. Mentzer getting the
courage to shoot Mr. Radin, that he had to drink a bottle of wine
before. Mr. Marti shot first and emptied his gun into Mr. Radin and
Mr. Mentzer followed suit,'' said Rider.
   ``What else did Mr. Marti say?'' asked Deputy District Attorney
David Conn.
   ``Just that he hated Jews and he enjoyed shooting the big fat
Jew,'' said Rider.
   Rider, who is being paid $3,000 a month as a protected
prosecution witness, has said he fears he will be killed because of
his testimony.
   Also charged is Robert Ulmer Lowe, who is fighting extradition
in Maryland.

<HEAD>Federal Agent Linked to Murderous Sect Charged in Drug Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities say the corrupting power of drugs
and a belief in witchcraft led to the downfall of a federal agent
involved with a cult of ritual killers.
   Salvador Vidal Garcia Alarcon, 39, was indicted Friday on drug
trafficking charges. The nine-year veteran of the federal judicial
police pleaded innocent in 7th Federal Criminal Court. If
convicted, he faces a term of of seven to 25 years in prison.
   In a lengthy statement given earlier to police, Vidal Garcia
said his contact with the sect was limited to religious matters. He
explained he had been possessed by spirits all his life and sought
relief from their disrupting powers from the godfather of the cult,
Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo.
   Vidal Garcia described the spirits as useful in helping the
victims of black magic but said they were also potent and
troublesome. He said he could only get relief from someone with
magical powers greater than his own.
   He said Constanzo would perform spiritual ``cleansings''
involving animal sacrifice.
   Constanzo had a lucrative practice as a clairvoyant and
``cleanser'' in Mexico City. ``Cleansing'' is designed to remove a
hex or evil spell and is widely practiced in Mexico.
   Vidal Garcia also said he attended black masses and cult
initiations.
   Deputy Federal Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo said Vidal
Garcia, a member of the federal drug task force, had been an
``excellent'' officer who was wounded several times in the line of
duty.
   His belief in witchcraft and the corrupting influence of drug
money brought about his downfall, Coello said.
   ``We don't believe he was responsible for any of the
homicides,'' Coello said.
   One cult member told authorities Vidal Garcia knew that
Constanzo followers had murdered and dismembered a transvestite in
Mexico City in 1988.
   Another, Sara Aldrete Villareal, the sect's alleged high
priestess, said Constanzo told her he killed two men as a favor to
Vidal Garcia. Their bodies were among the 15 discovered in
Matamoros in April.
   Vidal Garcia has been held in the Eastern Penitentiary in Mexico
City since he was arrested earlier this week.
   He was not charged in connection with the murders in Matamoros
or Mexico City or with other crimes alleged against the sect.
Authorities would not say if he will remain on the police force
until his case is resolved.
   The indictment accuses Vidal Garcia of stealing 4.4 pounds of
cocaine from a dentist last year in Guadalajara along with
Constanzo and Constanzo's right-hand man, who posed as U.S. drug
agents.
   Constanzo, a 26-year-old Cuban-American, and his lieutenant died
May 6 in a shootout with police in Mexico City.
   Cult members told police that Vidal Garcia used his position as
a federal agent to protect the smugglers. Coello insisted Vidal
Garcia is the only federal agent linked to the cult.
   Among the cult's victims was Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old
University of Texas pre-med student. He was kidnapped, tortured and
mutilated in what sect members say was a ceremony to invoke magical
protection for the narcotics business.

   The president of the National Council of
Churches told Presbyterians at a bicentennial symposium that a
major goal is to create one Christian church that cares about the
whole world.
   ``Our highest allegiance is not to one denomination or one
nation,'' the Rev. Patricia McClurg said Friday at a symposium on
the future preceding Tuesday's start of the 201st General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ``When we are doing our work
we see ourselves as part of one church. The pledge is to one God
and savior.''
   She acknowledged that U.S. Presbyterian leaders are worried
today that they are still losing members and influence in the
United States, ``and we do need to work on it with all due
seriousness and vigor.''
   But worldwide, she added, ``the Presbyterian Church is on fire
with church growth in Korea and Africa, on fire with its spiritual
and public witness in Taiwan. Our church daily is the difference
between life and death to millions of people across this planet
Earth.''
   The church, which has seen its membership decline from 4 million
to nearly 3 million since 1970, held its first General Assembly in
Philadelphia in 1789.
   The assembly starting Tuesday will involve 622 voting delegates
and an estimated 10,000 participants and observers.
   Among the items on the agenda for the voting delegates is the
selection of a new church moderator, or head.

<HEAD>Ends Don't Meet on State, City Pedway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Question: Why did the bureaucrat cross the road?
   Answer: Because the underground passage, built by the city and
state from opposite directions, didn't meet in the middle.
   ``Only in Chicago could we be building our tunnel and they be
building their tunnel ... and I guess we missed,'' Mayor Richard M.
Daley joked Friday about the pedway linking City Hall and the State
of Illinois Building across Randolph Street.
   But he got serious when he told reporters he was demanding a
full report on who was to blame for the mix-up and why the city has
agreed to pay for about $240,000 worth of corrections.
   The state's portion was a few inches too far east of the city's
(eight to be exact) and a few more inches below (nine).
   The problem started when the city hired contractors to dig its
half of the pedway and the state contracted with other people to do
their half. The result was a four-year delay in opening the tunnel.
   The opening is now set for September.
   The mix-up sounds like an episode from a comic opera, but at
least one taxpayer is not amused.
   ``The city screwed up or the state screwed up, but either way,
us taxpayers get the bill. So what's new?'' said James McGee,
standing outside City Hall and in front of a plywood wall erected
to keep pedestrians from the work site.
   ``I came down here to get my vehicle sticker and I'm glad I did.
The way the city is throwing away money,'' added McGee, a
meatcutter, ``it'll probably cost me more next year.''
   The city appropriated $240,000 to cover the cost of correcting
the mistakes, said mayoral spokeswoman Marj Halperin. A published
figure of $309,000 included money spent on non-corrective work, she
said.
   The changes include a new steel-frame skeleton to accomodate a
stairway instead of a ramp, and the addition of an elevator stop at
City Hall to give the handicapped the same access to the pedway
that was lost when the ramp had to be scrapped.
   ``To put it simply, we planned a 100-foot-long ramp from City
Hall into the pedway,'' said John C. Hill, the city's coordinating
architect. ``But we had to scrap it because hooking the segments as
they sit right now would leave a slope too steep for the state code
(regarding handicapped access).
   ``That meant abandoning a lot of what was there and redoing it.
We were both supposed to come in at 22 feet, 4 inches below ground
level and somebody didn't,'' Hill concluded.
   That somebody isn't the state, insists Capital Development Board
spokeswoman Mia Jazo.
   ``We don't want to get into any more finger-pointing,'' she
said, ``but our portion is exactly where it should be.''

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand will test all apples imported
into the country following the discovery that some apples from the
United States and other countries contained excessive levels of the
chemical Alar, a Thai Food and Drug Administration official said
today.
   Pakdee Pothisiri said the agency has fixed the maximum safety
limit of Alar, the trade name for daminozide and used to regulate
the ripening of apples, at 20 parts per million. Those found to
exceed this level will be taken off the market, he said.
   The United States is the largest apple exporter to Thailand.
   In Washington, Uniroyal Chemical Co. announced Friday that it
was voluntarily halting domestic sales of the chemical because it
wanted to calm consumer fears.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has said it plans to ban the
use of daminozide in food products because tests in laboratory
animals have linked a byproduct of Alar with cancer after the
chemical is heated. Final action on the proposed regulation is not
expected until next year.
   Some apples from the United States, Canada and Australia
recently tested by health inspectors had a higher content of Alar
than this level, Pothisiri said.
   Local newspapers said apple sales in Thailand have recently
dropped by 80 percent following warnings from the Public Health
Ministry about apples contaminated with excessive Alar.

   Severe thunderstorms whipped the Plains with high winds, heavy
rain and hail today after tornadoes spun through Nebraska and
Texas, and high winds toppled church steeples in Massachusetts,
killing a woman.
   Thunderstorms also rumbled over coastal sections of North
Carolina. Winds gusted to 60 mph at Elizabeth City, trees were
blown down in Camden and Currituck counties and lightning downed
several trees at Lumberton.
   In Fitchburg, Mass., high winds ripped through the center of
town, felling trees, power lines and two church steeples and
killing at least one person Friday. Sandra R. Cressey, 53, of
Fitchburg was in her car when it was crushed by a wooden steeple
that fell from the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church, said
Vicky Greene, a nursing supervisor at Burbank Hospital.
   Parts of Nebraska were among the hardest hit by storms in the
central and southern Plains Friday night and early today.
   A tornado touched down near Crete, but there were no reports of
damage or injuries. Seven people were injured in the Lincoln area
when strong winds blew over a camper at a recreation area.
   In Kansas, winds gusted to 77 mph at Russell and to 60 mph at
Hill City.
   In Texas Friday evening, winds overturned a tractor-trailer and
a tornado was reported near Coahoma. Winds gusted to 60 mph near
Plano and to 58 mph at Dallas-Fort Worth, and golfball-size hail
fell to a depth of 4 inches near Lamesa.
   Golfball-size hail also fell at Fillmore, Mo., and in the Denver
area.
   Several trees were uprooted at Rogers, Ark., and thunderstorms
dropped hail and 2 inches of rain in 2 hours at Camden. Little Rock
Air Force Base at Jacksonville, Ark., recorded more than 2\ inches
of rain in the 6 hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   In New Mexico, hail fell near Fort Sumner and at Raton.
   Thunderstorms also dropped heavy rain near Lander, Wyo., Friday
evening, and scattered thunderstorms hit northern and western
Nevada, and east-central California.
   Skies were mostly clear this morning from New England to the
Ohio Valley, over the Pacific Northwest, and across most of Arizona
and Southern California.
   Patchy dense fog developed in southeast Kentucky, with
visibility near zero in many areas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from parts
of Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and Utah across the northern and central
Rockies, the central and southern Plains, most of the Mississippi,
Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the central Gulf Coast states to the
southern Atlantic Coast states. Thunderstorms may be severe from
western Texas across Oklahoma to south central Kansas.
   Predicted highs: 60s from the northern and central Rockies

<TEXT>
   The new $355 million SkyDome stadium is the
latest symbol of Toronto's rise to major league stature, but it has
also led to questions about traffic congestion, crime and urban
woes in Canada's largest city.
   Residents have poured civic pride into preparations for this
evening's gala for the world's first stadium with a retractable
roof. But many residents wonder how this fast-growing city can
handle more downtown crowds.
   The concerns however go much further than downtown to address
the quality of life throughout the booming metropolitan area, which
has reached a population of nearly 4 million decades sooner than
expected.
   ``We're really to some extent choking on our growth,'' said John
Bossons, an economics professor at the University of Toronto who
long has been involved in municipal issues. ``We've been too
successful in a sense.''
   He recalled a transportation study of five or six years ago that
projected a metropolitan population of 4 million by the year 2011.
Five million people in metropolitan Toronto, which had half that
many residents in 1971, now seems more appropriate for 2011.
   The 60,000-seat Skydome, at the foot of the landmark CN Tower,
will be the home of the Toronto Blue Jays of baseball's American
League and the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts.
   The Skydome roof was designed to open or close in 20 minutes,
but inspectors found exposed wiring, missing sprinklers and faulty
fire prevention devices among 150 deficiencies. An operating permit
finally was granted Thursday, but critics say deficiencies remain
in the stadium, which they call another example of development run
amuck.
   Critics also predict that fans will swamp already crowded
streets and highways with the extra traffic to the complex.
   Toronto has prided itself on keeping residential neighborhoods
near downtown. Its public transit system still is considered a
model. Movie set designers have to scatter garbage on the streets
when trying to make Toronto look like an American city.
   Not short on civic cheer, the city is seeking the 1996 Summer
Olympics and a world's fair for the year 2000.
   Pat Petersen, director of the urban studies program at the
University of Toronto, said residents are troubled at their
recollections of a calmer, different Toronto 10 or 15 years ago.
   ``It isn't that it's bad; it's just becoming a city,'' she said.
   Supporters of a movement that promises to firmly regulate
development won a majority of city council seats in a municipal
election late last year.
   ``It was very, very clear in the election that people were
really concerned about what they perceive as a decline in the
quality of life,'' Bosson said.
   ``We're a city at the crossroads,'' Jack Layton, one of the most
visible council members, said in an interview. ``I think the city
has been a little too smug in thinking of itself as such a
success.''
   He said the housing problems in Toronto should be getting more
attention than stadium-building.
   A newspaper poll of 1,800 people taken for a 10-part series in
the Toronto Star last month found that 35.6 percent of city
residents were more afraid of walking alone at night than five
years ago and 48 percent more afraid of riding the subway alone at
night.
   ``We still brag that Canada's largest city doesn't have half the
problems that are sucking the life out of urban America,'' the
series wrote. ``But suddenly we aren't so sure that it can't happen
to us.''
   Housing costs have soared in the economic boom that has lasted
through most of the decade, pushing the average cost of a Toronto
home to more than $232,000 and making ``affordable housing'' a
prime city issue.
   The only other Canadian city that even comes close is Vancouver,
where the average price has risen to $176,700. The average housing
price in Montreal is $92,600 and in Edmonton, Alberta, $71,600.

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers say discussions have
barely begun on whether to produce more oil at a time when prices
of a barrel have surged 40 percent since November.
   Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, the president of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said officials
discussed ``the whole agenda'' during private talks Friday. He
would not elaborate.
   The ministers of the 13-nation group were meeting privately
today to try to work out a production agreement for the last half
of the year. Their formal strategy session begins Monday.
   Most ministers appear unwilling to adopt tactics that could
upset what has been a surprisingly strong market so far this year.
   Indeed, some officials say the ministers may decide to roll over
the current agreement for another six months.
   In November, the ministers agreed to curb their production and
set a cap of 18.5 million barrels a day. They settled on a
benchmark price of $18 a barrel.
   Since then, the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by
OPEC has shot up, rising more than 40 percent to nearly $17.70 a
barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, has been
trading around $20 a barrel.
   Prices have been pushed up not only by OPEC's output cuts but
also by accidents in oil-producing areas. They have combined to
trim the supply of oil on the world market.
   In their bargaining, the ministers will discuss whether to
maintain their output cap, or lift it to 19.5 million or 20 million
barrels a day, as several countries have requested.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Report: Bush To Propose Alternative Fuels Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to press 25 U.S. cities
to begin converting to alternative fuels as early as 1992 to battle
urban smog, a newspaper reported today.
   The most stringent of the four options Bush is considering would
require that 50 percent of all new cars, trucks and buses in the 25
cities be required to run on alternative fuels by 1995, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   The least stringent option would require only buses and official
automobiles in those cities to use alternative fuels, but would
accelerate the deadline to 1992, the Times said.
   The cities were not identified in the 42-page White House
document prepared by the President's Domestic Policy Council and
obtained by the Times. But the cities would include Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago, Houston, Denver and other major urban areas, the
Times said.
   The president's alternative fuels plan represents the central
element of his effort to revive and overhaul the federal effort _
stalled under the Reagan Administration _ to combat pollution in
major cities.
   Alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas, methanol
and ethanol, burn more cleanly than gasoline and reduce the
production of ozone, the major component of smog.
   Even the stringent pollution-reduction plan outlined for the
president would leave 23 cities in violation of federal air
standards by the year 2005. Last summer, 81 cities fell short of
the federal standards.
   The cost of the various proposals was not outlined in the
document presented to Bush, but estimates range from $2.1 billion
to $4.6 billion, the Times said.
   The report says that the use of alternative fuels would
``obviate the need for other more costly automobile controls'' on
emissions. Controls such as changes in tail pipes and fuel pumps
have been strongly opposed by U.S. auto makers.
   The report also suggests that cities be given the opportunity to
``opt out'' of the alternative fuels requirement if they can find
other was to reduce smog substantially.
   The report was presented to Bush before he left last weekend for
Europe. It faces final review Monday during a meeting of the
Domestic Policy Council.

the Seabrook nuclear power plant say the imminent start of atomic
testing at the reactor should help their cause.
   ``Now it's beginning to sound real. Before it was sounding kind
of nebulous,'' Wes Crocheron of the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance
said Friday night as the first demonstrators began trickling into
this seacoast town.
   ``People are fired up against the nuke, especially now that they
got the low-power testing license,'' Crocheron said.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a low-power
testing licence last week. The first atomic chain reaction is
expected at the reactor by the middle of next week.
   The alliance was planning a major rally today at Hampton Beach
State Park, on the crowded beach peninsula less than two miles from
Seabrook that is a focal point of the struggle over whether the $6
billion reactor ever will operate commercially. Evacuation plans
for the beaches and communities up to 10 miles away from the plant
must be approved before the plant may operate commercially.
   On Sunday, the activists plan a mass civil disobedience action
at the plant site. Clamshell spokesman Paul Gunter said at least
300 to 500 people already had undergone non-violent civil
disobedience training, and more training sessions were being held
throughout the weekend.
   On Friday, Superior Court Judge Vincent Dunn denied Seabrook
town officials' request for an injunction against Sunday's
demonstration.
   Seabrook police Chief Paul Cronin indicated Friday police may
arrest demonstrators before they reach the plant gates on Sunday.
Some of the protesters hope to scale fences around the outer plant
boundary and symbolically ``occupy'' the site.
   Protest organizers hope this weekend's demonstrations will be
the largest in more than a decade at Seabrook. There have been
about 2,500 arrests in protests that began when construction
started in 1976, including 1,414 arrests in a May 1977 protest that
helped make Seabrook a symbol of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.

killing 15 people and injuring 25, officials said today.
   Police, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, said the
accident occurred early Friday when the driver apparently attempted
to make the turn while traveling too fast.
   The driver fled the scene and was being sought for questioning,
officers added.
   Thirteen people were instantly killed and two others died later,

<HEAD>Organ Preservation Solution Revolutionizing Field</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clinicians are preserving transplant organs for
longer periods in an improved chemical solution that is healthier
for patients and gives doctors more leeway in scheduling surgery.
   ``This solution is clearly better than what's been available.
It's a major advance in transplantation,'' said Dr. Robert Gordon,
associate professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh.
   The biggest impact has been in liver transplants, where half of
all organs go to waste because of logistical and organizational
problems, said the University of Wisconsin's Dr. Folkert Belzer,
who developed the solution.
   His mixture, previously available to select transplant centers
on an experimental basis, was approved for general use last month
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   The solution includes hormones, amino acids and sugars. It
prevents tissue swelling and cell deterioration from the time the
organ is removed from a brain-dead victim until it is transplanted.
   Under the older preservation method, livers were chilled and
flushed with Euro-Collins solution, a mix of electrolytes and
glucose.
   With the older solution, surgical teams had to spring into
action as soon as donor organs were found and transplant candidates
had to live near the center. Transplants often began in the middle
of the night, with one operation sometimes starting as soon as
another finished.
   Organs regularly were turned down because of a lack of doctors
or surgical space.
   ``This is the first time we've ever been able to do a liver and
pancreas electively,'' Belzer said Friday at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.
   The Wisconsin solution, called ViaSpan and marketed by Du Pont,
has allowed for greater sharing of organs. Last fall, for example,
a liver was shipped from Toronto to Paris and successfully
transplanted. Another was shipped from the United States to Brazil.
   It's also enabled doctors to trim livers for young recipients or
split them for two patients when necessary.
   Studies in the United States and Europe have found livers can be
preserved safely outside the body for as long as 36 hours with the
solution, compared to a maximum six to eight hours with other
methods, said Dr. James Southard of the University of Wisconsin.
   Pancreases have been stored for as long as 29 hours with the
solution, Southard said.
   The preservation time for kidneys remains about the same, 30 to
40 hours, regardless of which solution is used, Southard said. But
studies show recipients of kidneys preserved in the Wisconsin
mixture do not return as often to dialysis because of organ
rejection and other problems.

<HEAD>Conservative Episcopalians Form Church Within Denomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Episcopalians reacting to
the election of the first woman bishop have created a new
association to ``transform'' their denomination.
   Nearly 2,000 people attended the founding meeting of the
Episcopal Synod of America Friday. The delegates adopted a
constitution Friday and planned to end their meeting today.
   The dissident church members said they were displeased with
loosening strictures on marriage, tolerance of homosexuality,
feminist theology, revisions of liturgical language to be
gender-inclusive and what they saw as slackening standards of
personal morality in the Episcopal Church.
   ``If we remain a church within the church, our goal isn't to be
a small cell, but to be a witness to hopefully transform our
religion,'' said Bishop David Schofield of the Episcopal Diocese of
San Joaquin in Fresno, Calif.
   But members of the new church say they do not intend to break
with the nearly 2.5 million-member Episcopal Church, which has lost
about a quarter of its members since doctrinal controversies
reached their peak in the mid-1970s. The church is one of 27
branches of the 70 million-member Anglican Communion worldwide.
   Bishop Clarence Pope of Fort Worth was elected president of the
new association. He said the Episcopal Church's laws do not prevent
the traditionalists from forming a voluntary association, and he
called for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for
traditionalists to stay within the church.
   Twenty-one other Episcopal bishops, 16 of them retired, have
endorsed the synod.
   Leaders of the Fort Worth-based Evangelical and Catholic
Mission, a traditionalist group, called the synod after the Rev.
Barbara Harris was consecrated as the first female Episcopal bishop
last year in Massachusetts.
   ``This year we will have women bishops, next year they'll delete
a book or two from the New Testament,'' said Oswald Clark, a lay
member of the General Synod Church of the Church of England. ``The
substance of the question remains the same: On what ground do you
stand?''
   The new synod passed a resolution recommending usage of the 1928
Book of Common Prayer, which is discouraged by the church,
alongside the 1979 revision.

   A deranged man was found in the bedroom
of Sweden's Princess Christina after a break-in, a newspaper
reported today.
   Christina, 45, and her husband Tord Magnusson were not at home
when the incident occurred last week, the Stockholm daily Expressen
said.
   The man was found in her bed by friends of the couple that had
been invited to stay. He had broken into the 18th century house
through a window on a day when the burglary alarm had been shut
off, Expressen said.
   A police spokesman confirmed ``an incident'' had taken place at
Magnusson's home but said they were not prepared to comment further.
   Expressen said the intruder was taken to a mental hospital. It
said he was known to have a fixation on the princess, the older
sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf.
   The paper said he told police: ``I want to see the princess, I
have always loved her, I have to meet her.''
   In 1982, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II was surprised in her
bedroom by a man who passed all security installations in London's
Buckingham Palace. She was unharmed in the incident, which caused a
scare in England.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of boat people, saying they would
rather die than return to Vietnam, today maintained a hunger strike
to protest immigration policies in this British colony, officials
said.
   About 2,000 Vietnamese began the protest Thursday, and another
3,300 joined them Friday, said a government official.
   But the number of hunger strikers dropped to 4,500 at the
Whitehead Detention Center. ``About 800 ate lunch today,'' the
official said.
   Hong Kong adopted a screening policy in June 1988 that treated
all incoming boat people as illegal immigrants subject to
repatriation unless they could prove they fled political
persecution.
   The policy has not curbed the flows of Vietnamese. Since the
plan was implemented, more than 20,000 boat people have arrived in
Hong Kong and only 1,600 have been screened.
   A total of 9,203 boat people arrived in May, compared with 2,918
in April and 842 in March.
   The United Nations says about 72,000 boat people were in camps
throughout the region at the end of April.
   Under international pressure, Vietnam has agreed to attend an
international conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva in June
13-14.

<HEAD>Accountant Charged with Murder Wept During Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church-going accountant accused of
murdering five relatives in New Jersey 18 years ago broke down in
tears several times during a visit from his minister.
   ``There seemed to be some relief about him,'' said the Rev.
Joseph M. Vought, who visited John E. List, 63, in jail Friday.
``Whether that was reflective of the fact that he didn't have to
put up the front anymore, I don't know.''
   FBI agents arrested List _ known to his wife, employer and
neighbors in the Richmond suburb of Midlothian as Robert P. Clark _
Thursday on charges of fleeing to avoid prosecution for the Nov. 9,
1971, slayings of five family members in Westfield, N.J.
   ``His wife had no idea who he was,'' said John McGinley, head of
the Newark, N.J., FBI office. ``Her reaction was disbelief and
shock.''
   A tip resulting from a May 21 broadcast of the Fox Broadcasting
Co. television show ``America's Most Wanted,'' which dramatized the
crimes, led to List's arrest.
   List did not change his appearance or his profession after the
killings, but moved to Colorado, where he met his current wife at a
Lutheran church function in 1977 and married her eight years later,
authorities said.
   ``I was shocked to hear about Bob's arrest and what he was
charged with,'' said Delores Clark, who married the man she knew as
Bob Clark in 1985.
   ``This is not the man I know,'' she told The Richmond News
Leader. ``The man I know is kind, loving, a devoted husband and a
dear friend.''
   An attorney for List, David P. Baugh, said Friday that his
client had declined a bond hearing and will remain in the Henrico
County jail. A removal and probable cause hearing was set for
Thursday in federal court.
   FBI agent Kevin N. August, who was among the three FBI agents
who arrested List, said List initially denied he was the man sought
by authorities.
   Agents took List to the Richmond Bureau of Police, where a
fingerprint expert determined that the man was List.
   On Dec. 7, 1971, the bodies of List's mother, Alma, 85; his
wife, Helen, 45; and their three children, Patricia, 16, John Jr.
15, and Frederick, 13, were found in their 18-room New Jersey
mansion, after neighbors noticed lightbulbs going out in the home,
police said.
   After the slayings, investigators found that List had two
mortgages on his house, was failing as a financial consultant and
had been siphoning money from his mother's $200,000 savings account.

   The government has confiscated two cars and
given their drivers one-year jail terms for driving on the wrong
side of a new highway, state-run television reported.
   The television said the decision came Friday from the ruling
Revolution Command Council.
   It was the harshest sentence imposed since a crackdown against
traffic violations took effect earlier this year.
   Traffic police said accidents are down by 30 percent since
enforcement began on the new measures, which include stiff fines
and prison terms.
   The cars were on the wrong side of a recently opened highway
linking Iraq with Jordan and Kuwait, the television said. There
have been several fatal accidents along the 625-mile highway.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire Donald Trump has won a court order
barring a moving company from calling its service the Trump
Shuttle, although the firm claims the name has nothing to do with
Trump's airline purchase.
   Trump, whose name graces Manhattan towers, Atlantic City casinos
and a very large yacht, on Friday sued International Trading and
Finance Corp. Ltd., which said ``Trump Shuttle'' was the registered
trademark of its moving and storage service for artworks.
   U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram issued a temporary
restraining order, barring the company from using the disputed name
until at least later this month, when another hearing is scheduled.
   Trump is slated to close a deal next week to buy strikebound
Eastern Airline's shuttle service and plans to re-launch it as the
``Trump Shuttle,'' from New York to Washington and Boston.
   A June 16 hearing will determine if Friday's restraining order
against ITFC should remain in effect until the legal battle is
resolved.
   Fracassi, who has registered the mark Trump Shuttle in New York
state and is seeking federal trademark registration, said earlier
this week that the name is his, and that Trump is the interloper.
   Fracassi said the name stemmed from the company's slogan, ``Play
your trump card _ use the Trump Shuttle.''
   Trump had agreed to purchase Eastern's shuttle in October 1988,
but the deal was held up after Eastern was hit with a crippling
strike in March.
   ITFC registered the trademark in New York in April and filed for
rights to the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The
company is listed in the Washington telephone directory as Trump
Shuttle.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and his Cabinet today
convened for the first time, but doubts remain whether the public
will be satisfied by what opposition politicians called a stopgap
government.
   Parliament elected Uno as Japan's 47th prime minister Friday to
replace Noboru Takeshita, who resigned because of an
influence-peddling scandal. Uno's appointment ended the governing
Liberal Democratic Party's five-week search for a candidate
untainted by the scandal.
   The new government was formally approved by Emperor Akihito in
an afternoon ceremony at the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo. The
first meeting of Uno's 21-member Cabinet followed at the prime
minister's official residence.
   Opposition political parties and many analysts said they expect
Uno to last only a few months, perhaps departing this summer if the
Liberal Democrats fare poorly in an election expected in July for
half the seats in the upper house.
   During an 80-minute news conference after his first Cabinet
meeting, however, the 66-year-old former foreign minister said he
expected to be a success. ``It is not an interim Cabinet, and I can
tell you that it will be a Cabinet which will be highly
appraised,'' he said.
   Uno said he had changed some of the party practices and declared
that ``all the Cabinet members agreed to put priority on carrying
out various reforms.''
   Asked if he would be influenced in any way by former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the longtime leader of the party
faction in which Uno was a senior member, Uno reminded reporters he
quit the faction upon assuming the premiership and that Nakasone
resigned from the party because of the scandal.
   ``I highly admire the former prime minister for his achievements
... but I'll do it my own way,'' Uno said.
   Uno has pledged ``a clean start'' for Japanese politics, which
have been stained by the scandal in which Recruit Co., an
information services conglomerate, tried to buy favors from senior
politicians and bureaucrats.
   The most pressing task for Uno will be to reverse low public
approval ratings for his party before next month's elections for
the upper house of parliament. The Liberal Democrats have
controlled both houses of parliament since 1955, but political
observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a
result of the Recruit scandal.
   Uno's choice as party secretary general, Ryutaro Hashimoto, told
reporters on Friday he had received $17,000 in 1985-86 from the
Recruit Co. The new chief Cabinet secretary, Masajuro Shiokawa,
said he gave an unsigned receipt to another Liberal Democrat, who
used it to divide a large donation from Recruit among several
receipts to skirt legal reporting requirements.
   The makeup of the new Uno administration, which contains six of
the same Cabinet ministers who served under Takeshita, ``raises the
strong suspicion that the Liberal Democrats have learned nothing
serious from the Recruit scandal,'' the daily Japan Times wrote in
an editorial today.
   Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-rate
stock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.

   Syrian gunners blasted the Christian
heartland with 400 howitzer shells today, and five artillery rounds
crashed into Moslem west Beirut in another violation of a
cease-fire called three weeks ago.
   Police said they could not determine the source of fire on west
Beirut, but the Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio station blamed
Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun. It was the first time
that west Beirut has been shelled since an Arab League cease-fire
was called May 11.
   Although Syrian gunners had been harassing the Christian
heartland with daily shelling, today's barrage was the most severe
in three weeks. It engulfed the coastal stertch north of Beirut,
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda and the nearby Hadath
and Kfar Shima districts.
   No casualties were reported, mainly because most of the shells
crashed into the Christian and Moslem neighborhoods at dawn while
people were indoors.
   An aide to Aoun said, ``We won't remain idle if the cease-fire
violations persist. The general is not prepared to accept the
intensifying shelling.''
   ``We will be forced to fire back,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   He denied the army had fired on west Beirut today. He accused
Syrian gunners of hitting the Christians and the Moslems ``so that
our citizens in the western sector would have the impression that
we are shelling them.''
   The aide said Christian gunners would not take any action until
after a meeting Sunday in Casablanca, Morocco, of a committee the
Arab League appointed to seek a solution to the crisis in Lebanon.
   ``Peace will prevail if the leaders adopt a clear decision on
consolidating the cease-fire and lifting the blockades,'' the aide
said. ``If they fail to stop the Syrian violation of the ceae-fire,
then we will have to fire back.''
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
began March 8 when Aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by
Moslem militias south of Beirut. The Syrians and Moslems retaliated
by shelling the Christian heartland, then blockading the
310-square-mile enclave.

   A thunderstorm spawned flash floods
and a rare tornado that battered villages in the southern
Philippines, killing at least 11 people and forcing thousands to
flee their homes, officials said today.
   The government's Office of Civil Defense said the storm swept
Friday over 12 villages in the coastal areas of Malita in Davao del
Sur province, 650 miles southeast of Manila.
   Gloria Laguidao, a regional civil defense administrator, said
the storm uprooted trees and crops, destroyed 150 houses and two
bridges and killed 11 people. Two people were reported missing and
at least four were hurt.
   Philippine Red Cross officials said four children were among the
dead in Malita, including a 9-day-old baby who drowned when a house
was swept by floodwaters.
   Another infant was accidentally crushed to death by his mother
as she tried to clasp her arms around a tree as the tornado passed.
   Miss Laguidao said the storm forced 650 families, about 3,900
people, to evacuate their homes.
   Malita remains under ``waist-high'' water, she said. The
flooding prevented government relief trucks from reaching the area
after two bridges collapsed.
   ``That tornado was a freak,'' said forecaster Jun Falcon. ``We
seldom get tornadoes here unless there is a sudden drop in
atmospheric pressure.''
   The storm forced rescuers today to halt a search for 21 people
believed trapped in several mine shafts after a landslide and fire
in a gold-mining community on the slopes of Mount Diwalwal in
nearby Davao del Norte province.
   Authorities said at least 11 people died and 21 were reported
missing in the landslide and fire. The blaze also destroyed 180
houses.

   The salesman-artist who painted the first
Coca-Cola wall sign was no Rembrandt, but 95 years later his work
is getting about as much attention from restorers as any
masterpiece.
   Preservationists Alison Free and Aggie Ferguson have put in a
month of painstaking work on the side of Young Brothers Pharmacy in
Cartersville, about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta, to bring to
light what Atlanta-based Coca-Cola executives agree is the first of
its kind.
   Restoring the large red-and-white sign, which says ``Drink
Coca-Cola,'' was the idea of the pharmacy's owner, Dean Cox, who
said townspeople had told him he had a historic treasure under
layers of paint on the store's wall.
   ``I'd heard the rumor for years,'' Cox said, ``and then I
finally got confirmation from Coca-Cola that this was the first
painted wall sign.''
   Coca-Cola representative Randy Donaldson said the original sign
was painted in 1894 by salesman James Couden, who set the precedent
for what later became a standard offer: Sell Coca-Cola in your shop
and the company would paint your wall for free.
   ``Couden was a salesman first and painter next,'' Donaldson said
Friday night, ``so his sign is not quite up to specs. The letters
are kind of squashed.''
   Ms. Free described them as ``chunky'' and said she found another
feature that attests to Couden's amateur status as a painter.
   ``He left the `I' out of drink,'' she said. ``It looks like he
left it out and then stuck it back in there. It's crammed up with
the `N'.''
   She and Miss Ferguson, who operate a restoration company called
Signs of the Times, had a difficult time getting to the point where
they could critique the sign. They said what they had thought would
be a five-day job ended up taking almost 30.
   The task was made difficult because they could not be sure that
the Coca-Cola sign was the first paint put on the brick wall.
   ``If we had taken all the paint off (except the bottom layer) in
the beginning, we could have lost the sign,'' Miss Ferguson said.
   So they used heat guns and spatulas to chip away at a section of
the wall that held a modern Coca-Cola sign. After going through
layer after layer of Coca-Cola advertising, they found the original
sign.
   After the oldest Coca-Cola sign was exposed, the painters worked
at matching the original colors. They plan to repaint it next week.
   The extra work boosted the cost of the restoration project. Cox
said the final bill will be $8,000 to $10,000. He is paying most of
the tab, but Donaldson said Coca-Cola will pay part.
   ``I hope the state will put up a historical marker,'' Cox said.
``But if not, I will or maybe Coca-Cola will.''

   President Bush says he brought a
``message of hope'' back from his triumphant weeklong trip to
Europe but says he doesn't expect Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to respond soon to arms control initiatives embraced by
NATO nations.
   ``There's no grand design out there right now now. We just want
to move forward,'' Bush told reporters.
   The president went for an early-morning jog near his oceanside
estate and told reporters he had trouble sleeping, first waking up
at 3 a.m. and then rising at 4:45 a.m.
   The president planned to go fishing today in his boat and was to
meet in the afternoon with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and Maine Gov. John S. McKernan.
   Asked if he'd heard yet from Gorbachev, the president shouted as
he jogged past a group of reporters: ``No phone calls yet.''
   He is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday.
   At an arrival ceremony at nearby Pease Air Force Base in
Portsmouth, N.H., on Friday, Bush declared: ``We must stay on the
offensive. We must now get to work to end the cold war.''
   ``I am now returning from Europe with a message for the American
people _ a message of hope,'' Bush told a jubilant gathering
attended by a welcoming crowd of several thousand invited guests,
many of them schoolchildren. ``We have a great and historic
opportunity to shape the changes that are transforming Europe.''
   Bush, basking in praise from allies of his proposal for dramatic
troop reductions in Europe and for resolving a NATO dispute over
short-range missiles, told reporters on Air Force One shortly
before his arrival that he had not heard directly from Gorbachev on
the proposals.
   He added: ``You don't expect an instant answer. But I'm
confident we will and I hope it's positive.''
   ``It will be a while'' until a formal Soviet response, he
suggested.
   On prospects of a summit meeting this year with the Soviet
leader, Bush said, ``I've always felt that we eventually will get
together and should.''
   But the president gave no clues on when such a meeting might
take place, and dismissed suggestions that he and Gorbachev might
cross paths when Bush returns to Europe next month for the
seven-nation economic summit of industrial democracies in Paris _ a
trip that will also take him to the Warsaw Pact countries of Poland
and Hungary.
   ``I think the first priority is to follow through on the
collective decision that NATO has taken...So we've got some work to
do to make this NATO decision into a reality. But I'm determined to
kick our bureaucracy and the NATO bureaucracy as best I can (to)
push it forward,'' Bush said.
   After arriving in this seacoast resort, the president
immediately headed out into the Atlantic on his 28-foot speedboat,
``Fidelity,'' on a fishing trip _ spending about two hours out
before rain and a smoking engine forced him to return to port. He
pointed gleefully to a mackerel that his fishing party had caught
as he returned to the marina where he keeps his boat.
   Bush had no public appearances planned before he returns to
Washington on Sunday afternoon.
   In his arrival remarks, Bush said his proposal for conventional
arms cuts in Europe, which would include the withdrawal of 30,000
U.S. troops, was ``bold but fundamentally fair.''
   At the summit, Bush proposed a drastic reduction in East-West
conventional forces in Europe and said the cuts should come by 1993.
   At Bush's urging, NATO nations also agreed to a compromise
settlement of a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles that will
enable the weapons to be put on the negotiating table after a
conventional arms deal is completed. The United States and Britain
had voiced skepticism of such negotiations while West Germany
wanted them immediately.
   Bush said the compromise demonstrated that NATO could ``manage
change while remaining true to the strategy of deterrence which has
kept the peace'' for the past 40 years.
   In his talk with reporters on Air Force One, Bush was asked if
he felt his assertiveness in seeking to seize the initiative from
Gorbachev by proposing new disarmament initiatives in Europe had
won him new respect at home.
   Mentioning comedian Rodney Dangerfield, whose complaints about
not getting respect became a classic comedy line, Bush said: ``You
mean, like Rodney Dangerfield kind of thing? I've not suffered from
lack of respect.''
   But Bush allowed that he felt ``pretty good'' about the events
of the past few days.

<HEAD>Security Stepped Up at Frankfurt Airport</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs after last pvs, ``The spokesman ...'' to ADD charges
about Frankfurt Airport security, background on Flight 103. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have stepped up
security at Frankfurt Airport after receiving indications that
Middle East terrorists may be planning an attack, a spokesman said
today.
   Christian Jalezke, spokesman for the Hesse state Interior
Ministry, said the alert was linked to the sentencing of hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was convicted of murder and
air piracy and sentenced to life imprisonment on May 17 for
hijacking a TWA airliner in June 1985. During the hijacking, U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot and killed and 39 Americans were
held hostage for 17 days.
   Less than a week after Hamadi's sentencing, authorities ordered
all airports in the country to tighten security. Jalezke said the
latest alert came after authorities received indications that a
Middle East terrorist group he did not identify may be planning a
retaliatory attack for Hamadi's sentencing.
   He said the information received by authorities focused on a
terrorist action against air traffic. The information lacked
specifics but had to be taken seriously, Jalezke said.
   The spokesman declined to give details about the security
measures taken at Frankfurt Airport, except to say that the number
of policemen guarding continental Europe's busiest airport has been
increased.
   Some British news reports have questioned security at Frankfurt
Airport, where they say the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103
was planted.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and switched to a Boeing 747
in London. Investigators say a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette
recorder stored in luggage in the hold destroyed the New York-bound
plane as it flew over Scotland on Dec. 21. The crash killed all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.
   West German authorities have repeatedly insisted there is no
evidence the bomb was planted in Frankfurt.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb, whose departure was
delayed by the visit of President Bush, said goodbye to Italy today
and left the post he had held for eight years.
   Rabb had intended to leave the assignment May 20 but stayed on
through last week's presidential visit because Peter Secchia, the
Michigan businessman nominated to succeed Rabb, has not been
confirmed by the Senate.
   ``These eight years have seen a tremendous growth in Italy's
stature and importance on the world scene,'' Rabb said in remarks
prepared before his departure early this afternoon.
   ``Together Italy and the United States have resolved many
issues, and I'm proud that I leave Rome with no problems remaining
unresolved on the bilateral agenda,'' he said.
   Rabb also praised Italy's commitment to NATO that he said had
been demonstrated by its acceptance of cruise missiles and its
willingness to accept F-16 fighter bombers that will be expelled
from Spain.
   At the time of his departure, Rabb was the longest-serving U.S.
ambassador at a single overseas post.
   Rabb, who was accompanied by his wife Ruth and seen off by the
U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, Frank Shakespeare, intends to
resume his law practice in New York.
   Secchia's confirmation as Rabb's replacement has been stalled in
the Senate because of a concerns by Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a
Republican from Wyoming.
   Some senators have expressed reservations over Secchia's
qualifications for the job and his use of abrasive, sometimes
profane language in public.

<HEAD>Taiwan's President Calls For Pragmatic China Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui said today that if
Taiwan wants to regain international recognition it must admit that
the communists rule mainland China.
   Lee's statement was the first public acknowledgment by a
Taiwanese leader that the communists control the mainland.
   He made it at the opening session of a three-day congress of the
governing Nationalist Party, which has ruled Taiwan since the
Nationalists lost the mainland to the communists in a 1949 civil
war.
   ``We should have the courage to face the situation that for the
time being we are unable to exert effective rule over the
mainland,'' Lee told delegates, who included aged Nationalist
officials who fought in the war.
   However, he refused to relinquish the Nationalist claim to the
mainland.
   ``There is only one China and the country will be reunified
eventually. The ultimate goal of our foreign policy is to keep the
nation's sovereignty intact,'' he said.
   Lee also reiterated what is popularly known as Taiwan's ``Three
No'' policy toward the communists _ no official contacts, no
compromise and no talks.
   His address was considered a veiled criticism of the party's
conservative Old Guard, whose refusal to acknowledge communist rule
of China has been blamed for Taiwan's diplomatic isolation.
   Only 23 countries recognize the Nationalists, compared to 136
that have diplomatic ties with China.
   Lee said he believes a more flexible and pragmatic foreign
policy will encourage many countries to ``readjust their
short-sighted China policy'' and recognize his Nationalist
government.
   The Nationalists, he said, continue to support a student-led
democracy movement in China because the protesters ``are linked to
us by blood, in their fight for freedom, democracy and survival.''
   Also today, the party's newly appointed Secretary-General James
Soong told delegates Taiwan never will use force to reunify China.
   ``The reunified China we are seeking shall be guided by the free
will of all the Chinese and the principles of democracy,'' said
Soong.

<TEXT>
   An Egyptian naval ship opened fire on an
Israeli fishing boat today as it drew close to Egyptian territory,
Israel radio said. The captain of the fishing vessel was reported
wounded.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Allon Liel, said Israel demanded
Egyptian authorities explain their actions. ``We don't know exactly
what happened in this case, and we are asking the Egyptians for
details,'' he said.
   The radio said the confrontation occurred this morning near
Coral Island, a popular spot for Israeli divers, off the coast of
Eilat and near the Egyptian beach resort of Taba. The radio said
the Israeli fishing vessel was one mile from shore when an Egyptian
naval craft approached and opened fire.
   The captain of the Israeli vessel was hit in the legs and
stomach, but he managed to pilot his craft back to an Israeli-held
area of the beach. He was rushed to a hospital in the southern
resort city of Eilat, the radio said.
   Liel said Egypt's territorial limits vary in different areas
near Eilat but added that Israeli boats may not anchor or loiter in
Egyptian waters.
   Israel returned Taba, a 250-acre resort to Egypt in March, after
seven years of bitter squabbling over the beach resort.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people ate hot dogs and
listened to music today at a party thrown for the city where Pan Am
Flight 103 tumbled to earth, but relatives of crash victims said
the good time was in bad taste.
   Ed Blaus, a 14-year-old from Sicklerville, N.J., who suggested
the idea for the party to lift the city's spirits, said he was
surprised to learn the party had been dubbed ``Ed's Party.''
   ``I just want all the kids to come here and enjoy themselves
because they missed Christmas and everyone should have a
Christmas,'' he said.
   A bomb on board Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie four days
before Christmas, killing all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the
ground. Burning wreckage from the New York-bound Boeing 747
destroyed several Lockerbie homes.
   Relatives of some victims said the party was in poor taste.
   ``I have been talking with a number of those people bereaved by
this outrage and, without exception, they are saying that holding
this party is repugnant and abhorrent,'' Jim Swire, spokesman for
the U.K. Families-Flight 103 group, said today.
   Swire's daughter died in the explosion.
   Blaus, who read about the bombing in the newspapers and in
letters from Lockerbie pen pal David Stewart, said he first wanted
to send presents to Lockerbie, but his idea just grew.
   ``I wrote to Pan Am because I thought that everyone should have
a Christmas, no matter what. I just wanted them to send presents
over and they said they would help me,'' he said.
   ``But it just got bigger and bigger. I never thought it would be
called Ed's Party, but here I am and I am going to eat pizza.''
   Pan Am flew Blaus, his parents and three brothers to Lockerbie.
But Pan Am has said it was not organizing the party.
   Community leader Alex McElroy said the party was supported by
most local people, ``not to cause distress or anguish, but to prove
to themselves and the world that whereas we mourn those who died,
they are determined to repair their town, rebuild shattered lives
and ensure a special and sacred place in their hearts for the 270
people from 24 nations who died.''
   Complaints from relatives of the victims led the Disney
Organization to cancel plans to send Mickey Mouse to the party, and
the Hebrew National company decided against supplying hot dogs.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said
today he will fight to oust President Roh Tae-woo unless his
government takes steps to bring full democracy to South Korea.
   Kim, head of the largest opposition group, the Party for Peace
and Democracy, also said his talks with Roh, scheduled for later
this month, could be their last meeting.
   ``Let's give the Roh government six more months to solve the
Kwangju issue and implement full democracy. If it still fails to
fulfill the mission, our party will be all out to terminate it,''
Kim told a rally of 100,000 people at a Kwangju college.
   Dissidents are demanding that the government divulge details of
police suppression of a 1980 uprising in Kwangju in which, by
government count, at least 200 people were killed.
   Kim demanded that Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and other
government officials be held responsible for ``the unpardonable
massacre'' in the city.
   Kim's remarks were his strongest challenge to the Roh government
since Kim's party emerged as the No.1 opposition party in the 1988
general elections.
   Kim said the Roh government is backing away from promised
democratic reforms. His speech was interrupted twice as dozens of
radical students protested his party's moderate policies.
   Supporters threw cans and bottles and drove out protesting
students.
   After the two-hour rally, 10,000 people began a march through
downtown streets, shouting slogans for the ouster of the Roh
govenrment. Groups of up to 1,000, hurling rocks, fought police in
the city center for several hours.
   Some people were injured, but police had no overall figures.
   Kim has long been a popular in Kwangju, the capital city of his
home province, South Cholla, but his visit today was marred by
protests over his party's comparatively moderate policies.
   ``No compromise with murderers,'' protesters, mostly students,
shouted as Kim arrived at a cemetery where the bodies of the 1980
Kwangju victims are buried.
   Some protesters threw eggs, water and sand at Kim and party
officials as they arrived at a hospital morgue to pay homage to the
body of a dissident student found dead at a reservoir last month.
The opposition leader was not hit. Authorities announced early this
week that the student, Lee Chol-kyu, 24, died by drowning, but
dissidents claim that he was tortured to death by police.
   In central Seoul, 1,000 radical students and dissidents held a
rally today at Myungdong Cathedral, demanding that authorities
reinvestigate the student's death. They shouted slogans such as
``Down with Roh regime.

   A previously unknown Moslem group
today claimed it planted a small bomb that exploded in front of the
U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The homemade bomb, which caused no injuries, apparently was
intended for the neighboring Indian High Commission.
   Police said it was hurled from a moving vehicle Friday after
riot police fired tear gas and bullets to disperse 500 Moslem
demonstrators trying to march to the Indian High Commission.
   Moslems accuse Indian peacekeeping troops of failing to prevent
clashes between Tamils and Moslems in which at least 13 people were
killed last month. Most Tamils are Hindu, and both groups are
ethnic minorities among the majority Sinhalese Buddhists.
   Newspaper offices today received statements from the Noorul
Islamic Liberation Front claiming responsibility for the bomb.
Police said they have not heard of the group.
   Indian troops were sent to northern and eastern Sri Lanka in
1987 to enforce a peace accord to end a Tamil separatist revolt.
   Moslems accuse the Tamils of trying to force them, as well as
the Sinhalese, out of Eastern Province. The province's population
is equally divided among the three ethnic groups. Tamils account
for 18 percent and Moslems 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people.

<TEXT>
   The once-bustling Christian enclave
north of Beirut is a ghost town. Daily shelling by Syrian forces
has driven most residents underground and sapped the life from the
region once known as the Monte Carlo of the Middle East.
   The barrages have eased since the Arab League called for a
cease-fire May 11, but a gas shortage has paralyzed the region,
adding to the problems of a Christian population outnumbered and
outgunned by Syria and its allies.
   ``If it's not shelling, it's gas, and if it's not gas it's
something else,'' said Samira Khater, a secretary.
   An air of stupor hangs over the 310-square-mile enclave, home to
about 1 million Christians.
   There is hardly any traffic. Business is slow. Factories that
survived 11 weeks of ferocious shelling limp along with skeleton
staffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge.
   Restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day. Half the
shops, hidden behind sandbags and earth-filled oildrums, are
shuttered.
   The night life that once throbbed in the clubs, bars and
restaurants along the Mediterranean coastline is dead.
   The famous Casino du Liban, where oil-rich sheiks and high
rollers from around the world gambled, is closed.
   It was a regular target for Syrian gunners who have battled the
forces of Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun since March 8 in some
of the most savage battles of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Some 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded,
mostly civilians.
   The Christians are tired and dispirited, struggling to cope with
a grim fatalism.
   The Syrians maintain their blockade of the Christian enclave,
ringed on its landward sides by hostile Moslem forces.
   Small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in food
and ammunition for the Christians, so there is no shortage of those
items. But the blockade runners don't try bringing in gas.
   ``It only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel,'' a
police spokesman said.
   Supermarkets bulge with imported goods _ pink chamapagne,
passion fruit tea, 10 brands of whisky, cookies, chocolates, hams,
cheeses.
   Fruit and vegetables are in short supply, but available for a
price. Before the fighting, most produce came from
Syrian-controlled areas. Now they are smuggled in at night by mule
train from the north.
   The enclave's fuel reserves went up in flames when a Syrian
barrage blew up the seaside Dora depot in east Beirut two months
ago.
   The French, Lebanon's colonial rulers until 1943 and the
Christians' traditional protector, shipped in 4,000 tons of fuel to
reactivate closed power plants a few weeks ago.
   But there's precious little gasoline around. Only about
one-fifth of filling stations bother to open.
   Police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded in
gunfights over gas.
   A worker at one filling station, who did not want to be
identified, said it opens ``only when the army can send a tank to
maintain order.''
   ``That's why people have to wait for days in front of the
stations, and all they get in the end is 10 liters,'' a little more
than two gallons, he said.
   Gas costs about $3.50 for 5{ gallons, but on the black market
the same amount is going for $50 _ a month's wages for many
Lebanese.
   ``Filling station owners pump out the gas from their tanks and
sell it on the black market for 10 times the price,'' said one
motorist.
   Long lines of cars, some extending for a mile, sit outside many
stations.
   ``At first, everyone used to wait for days in their cars, even
during the shelling,'' grocer Samir Madi said. ``Now we take turns
to wait for a station to open.
   ``When it does, whoever's keeping vigil telephones everyone else
and they all rush to the station.''
   The casualties and damage wrought by Aoun's ``war of
liberation'' to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon has turned many
Christians against the man many hail as their hero.
   ``Aoun has used the Christian people,'' said one young man who
declined to be identified. ``He's led them into a dark tunnel of
hunger, death and siege because of his personal ambition to become
president.''

   President Bush's breakneck timetable
for wrapping up a conventional arms agreement with the Soviet Union
may be too optimistic given the complexity of the negotiations,
analysts say.
   But they say the president's sweeping proposals for slashing
troops and weapons in Europe will broaden East-West bargaining at
the Vienna arms talks and ensure that an eventual accord will be
wide-ranging.
   ``It will be a more comprehensive set of negotiations and a more
comprehensive agreement,'' said Richard Fieldhouse, a research
fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in
Sweden.
   ``That also means,'' he said, ``it will be more difficult.''
   Bush wants the talks brought to ``an early and satisfactory
conclusion'' within six to 12 months and their results implemented
no later than 1993.
   John Cross, deputy director of the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Bush initiative
``produces better prospects than hitherto for striking an arms
control bargain.''
   But he cautioned it will be ``impossibly hard without an
enormous amount of good will'' between the East and West
negotiators to bring the talks to an end a year from now.
   Bush's unveiling of the plan at a summit of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization was an attempt by the West to seize the arms
control initiative from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It also let the leaders of the 16 NATO nations emerge from their
40th anniversary celebration united.
   ``They got their act together and confirmed they have very much
more in common on what really matters,'' said Cross.
   The president's bargaining offer calls for sharp cuts in Soviet
and American troops stationed in Europe and in tanks, artillery and
other conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.
   Moreover, Bush said the United States, in a turnabout, would be
willing to negotiate reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters.
   The inclusion of aircraft, analysts say, will expand the
discussions to an important area of concern. But it also will make
the talks tougher because of the difficulty in defining attack
planes.
   Bush also urged that the two sides agree to destroy all weapons
that are singled out for reductions and that the troops be
disbanded.
   His proposal was unanimously adopted by the other 15 delegates
at the meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
   They agreed to let experts take a look at the plan and draw up a
detailed offer to put on the bargaining table when talks resume in
September. The Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations began
last March between the NATO nations and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
They cover the region spanning the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Analysts had predicted the discussions would last several years
at least. Previous negotiations dragged on 15 years with no
agreement.
   Fieldhouse said, ``It's clear enough that the two alliances have
similar enough objectives and enough common ground to reach an
accord.''
   Such an agreement, said Cross, would reduce substantially the
military threat in Europe but not erase the military might.
   The Soviet Union, he said, will remain a powerful force and NATO
will have enough strength to mount a defense if needed.
   Under the American plan, troop densities would be thinned.
   Bush proposed that both sides reduce their troop strength in
Europe to 275,000 on each side. That would mean a cut, according to
U.S. estimates, of 350,000 for the Soviets and 30,000 for the
United States.
   NATO's opening position would require the Warsaw Pact to big
massive cuts in main battle tanks, artillery and armored troop
carriers, considered key forces in an invasion or surprise attack.
   The West would make smaller trims of 5 percent to 10 percent in
those categories.
   The NATO allies want the East bloc nations to clip their forces
to a level equal with the West _ and below NATO's current holdings.
   Bush's arms control offer helped solve a bitter alliance dispute
over the future role of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Germany had demanded that NATO enter early talks with the
Soviets on reducing tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.
   The United States and Britain argued attention should first be
placed on the Soviet Union's enormous superiority in non-nuclear
weapons.
   The leaders' final statement said they would be prepared to
discuss a partial reduction in battlefield nuclear missiles but
only after implementation of a conventional arms accord was under
way.
   By underscoring the word ``partial,'' the United States and
Britain were able to halt, at least temporarily, a German push for
elimination of all those weapons.
   Bowing to German pleas, the allies also agreed to put off key
decisions on introducing and deploying a more powerful generation
of short-range nuclear missiles until 1992.

<HEAD>Gorbachev: Most Popular Foreign Leader; Far Ahead of Kohl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is the most popular foreign leader West Germany has known
and rates much higher than Chancellor Helmut Kohl, according to
poll results released Saturday.
   The Der Spiegel newsmagazine, which conducted the poll, said the
only West German politician more popular than Gorbachev is
President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   It augurs well for the Soviet leader's June 12-15 visit to this
country but could be ominous for Kohl, who faces federal elections
in 1990.
   The magazine asked 2,000 West German voters to rate Gorbachev
and West German politicians on a popularity scale from minus five
to plus five.
   Gorbachev received 2.2, while Kohl was rated at minus 0.6.
   President Bush, who paid a 25-hour visit to West Germany last
week, received 0.7, while French President Francois Mitterrand also
lagged behind Gorbachev with 1.7.
   ``Even John F. Kennedy and Charles de Gaulle at their peaks were
not as popular as Gorbachev,'' Der Spiegel said.
   Only Weizsaecker fared better than Gorbachev, the magazine said,
but it did say what rating he received. The presidency is a mostly
ceremonial post in West Germany.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who has been leading
West German calls for closer ties to the Soviet Union and more
disarmament talks, received a 1.4 rating.
   Der Spiegel said even West Germans who usually vote for Kohl's
conservative Christian Democratic Union rated Gorbachev nearly as
high as the chancellor, giving Kohl 2.0 and Gorbachev 1.9.
   Among those voters, 95 percent find Gorbachev farsighted, 94
percent think he is full of ideas and 95 percent say he is
hard-working, the magazine said.
   A parallel survey was conducted for the magazine by the
Sociology Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which polled
1,000 Moscow citizens.
   Only 59 percent of those polled in Moscow said they are
convinced Gorbachev's reform policies will succeed, the magazine
said. In the West German poll, 82 percent said they believe
Gorbachev will succeed.
   According to Der Spiegel, 76 percent of Muscovites queried
replied that ``perestroika will not be supported by the population
any more if the supply situation does not improve.''
   It said 61 percent of Moscow residents polled think the Soviet
economy is in ``bad or very bad'' shape.
   Der Spiegel released a summary of the survey results in advance
of the magazine's publication Monday.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Pik Botha Says South Africa Ready to End Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha says his government is eliminating racial discrimination and
is ready to share power with the black majority, Welt am Sonntag
newspaper reported Saturday.
   ``Apartheid has to be removed. The supremacy of whites must be
ended,'' the conservative newspaper quoted Botha as saying in an
interview.
   But Botha said this must done slowly to avoid chaos, it said.
   ``We are in agreement among us on this. We find ourselves in a
reform process and we accept that the supremacy of the whites has
to come to an end. Our government is in the process of removing
apartheid,'' Botha reportedly said.
   Botha said his government must examine closely laws governing
racially separate residential areas and the registration of people
by race. ``The racial discrimination that the blacks see in these
laws has to be removed.
   ``I am not saying that this can be achieved simply from one day
to another. If we lift these laws, a state of chaos would result.
As far as the lifting of discriminating laws is concerned, the
South African government has to make sure that the new situation is
not worse than the one we are trying to remove,'' Botha was quoted
as saying.
   Botha was quoted as saying Western countries should give South
Africa the time and chance to build and consolidate a system
reflecting its specific situation.
   Welt am Sonntag also quoted Botha as saying his government
constantly considers freeing jailed black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``We would be glad to release him, if it could happen in such a
way that it would not cause renewed violence and conflicts,'' Botha
was quoted as saying.
   He also rejected talks with the African National Congress
guerrilla movement or any other groups that use violence.
   Mandela, the African National Congress leader, many times has
refused Pretoria's offers of freedom because they are tied to a
renunciation of violence.
   Welt am Sonntag released the text of the interview in advance of
its publication Sunday.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE pope arriving in Iceland, pleading for
reconciliation of Christians. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II pleaded for the
reconciliation of all Christians on his arrival today in Iceland,
which has 1,800 Roman Catholics among its mainly Lutheran
population of 244,000.
   Starting the second leg of a five-nation Scandinavian tour in
one of the most unpolluted countries of the world, the pope also
noted that people everywhere are beginning to recognize that the
pursuit of materialism is threatening the environment.
   He also said people throughout the world are increasingly aware
that peace among nations ``can only be the fruit of a just economic
and social order.''
   Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson welcomed him at Keflavik
Airport on a grey and chilly day, saying the pope was received ``as
a true servant of the God in whom we believe, regardless of the
church to which we may belong.''
   Christianity was established as the official church in Iceland
1,000 years ago, but Roman Catholicism was vanquished by the
Protestant Reformation in the 16th century.
   The pope said part of this 24-hour visit to Iceland would ``seek
to encourage the good relations which have developed between
Iceland Catholics and the members of other ecclesial communities.''
   ``Despite the tragic divisions which have long separated
Christians, all of us must try to live in fidelity to the lord's
will, to be instruments of his reconciliation, to maintain the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.''
   At the airport, the pope kissed the ground as soon as he stepped
off his plane _ a gesture he makes in every country he visits for
the first time.
   A crowd of youngsters waved Icelandic flags, and the pope kissed
two young girls who presented him with flowers in the red, blue and
white colors of Iceland's flag.
   The pope flew to this northernmost capital in the world, just
below the Arctic Circle, from Tromsoe, Norway, where he extolled
marriage and strong family values in a country where many couples
live together without getting married.
   Police took into custody four people as the pope celebrated Mass
in the market square of Tromsoe, which is 200 miles north of the
Arctic Circle. Two women were detained for protesting closer
relations with the Catholic church, and two men criticized the
Vatican's human rights record.
   Police estimated fewer than 1,000 people attended in one of the
smallest crowds at an open-air Mass on the pope's 42 foreign trips.
   Speaking from a wooden altar, John Paul touched on an issue of
concern to the churches in Scandinavia, where about 50 percent of
the couples never marry and most children today are born out of
wedlock.
   ``The love of a married couple unites them, but it also enables
them to become cooperators with God in giving life to a new person,
'' he said, speaking in English.
   ``Thus they establish the most basic of human communities, the
family,'' which he said was ``a fundamental gift.''
   Catholic officials have complained of the difficulty of
encouraging traditional values in a secular atmosphere.
   John Paul also is visiting Finland, Denmark and Sweden on his
10-day tour. Only about 1 percent of Scandanavians are Catholic.
   Lutheran churches are tax-financed and part of the state
bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Under Siege, House Democrats Suspect a Plot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One congressman compares the atmosphere in the
House these days to the bloody battlefields of World War I ``where
sticking your head out of the trench might get it shot at.''
Another calls up the memory of dirty tricks used by the Nixon White
House to wage political warfare.
   An ``evil wind'' is blowing, says a Democratic chairman, Jack
Brooks of Texas. A Republican, Vin Weber of Minnesota, talks of the
outbreak of ``ethics war.'' Jim Wright, in shedding the
speakership, said ``mindless cannibalism'' had been let loose.
   Last week, House members found that the political ground rules
seemed to be shifting. The underlying habits of accommodation and
accord were giving way to a cut-throat partisanship so intense it
worried some.
   Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, a former ethics committee chairman, said
if the new mood persists ``the end result will be to destroy this
institution as we know it today.''
   Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the Republicans should ``stop the
war, if it's that, because the major concern we ought all to have
at this point is the institution.''
   What was new was the prospect of a siege of retribution in the
House: the use of ethics charges as a political tool.
   That's not the tradition. In the past, when the House censured
members for violating the rules, it did so as an institution acting
as a whole against the transgressions of an individual.
   Democrats say they see the hand of newly installed Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Wright's tormentor, behind the
events which put them in disarray last week. Some suspected they
were witness to, and victims of, a campaign that had its
inspiration outside the House.
   ``The fear is that it is in the hands of the Lee Atwaters of the
world,'' said Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``That's the concern.''
   Atwater, an aggressive political infighter, was a key strategist
in President Bush's campaign last year. Bush installed him as
Republican national chairman and Atwater has set out to end 35
years of Democratic domination of the House.
   Republicans scoff at the cries of foul play. Mickey Edwards of
Oklahoma said in an interview that if there is poison in the air
its source was the heavy-handed tactics by Wright as speaker _
stacking committees, restricting debate, maneuvering the minority
into defeats.
   ``Wright would use the rules in any way he could to manipulate
the outcome of a vote,'' Edwards said. ``Republicans, and many
Democrats, felt that it wasn't just a matter of getting outvoted,
it was a matter of not even having a fair shot.''
   When Wright said last week he was sorry if he had contributed to
the House's bitterness, ``that was ludicrous,'' said Edwards. ``He
was responsible for it more than any human being.''
   But Edwards added that his fellow Republicans may be off on a
dangerous game: ``Republicans have not cornered the market on
morality.''
   And Republican Weber said his party has no appetite for
escalation. ``There is a strong sense that we don't want to start
ethics wars,'' he told The Washington Post. ``I don't expect any
Republicans to file charges against Democrats.''
   On the other hand, Republican Bill Green, N.Y., said ethics is a
legitimate political issue. After all, he said, ``You've had two of
the top three Democrats here resign.''
   ``If the Democrats want to stop what Jim Wright called the
`mindless cannibalism,' the place to begin is to call off their
vendetta against Newt Gingrich,'' said Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan,
chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.
   ``The Democrats believe this is a concerted, planned,
coordinated effort,'' said Steny Hoyer, D-Md., of the Republican
hardball. ``It is a continuation of the 1988 campaign.''
   The reference, of course, was to events which caused Wright to
renounce the speakership and his seat after a long ethics
investigation, led the ambitious Rep. Tony Coelho of California,
the No. 3 Democrat, to resign from Congress rather than face an
ethics investigation and led FBI agents to question William H.
Gray, D-Pa., during the Memorial Day weekend about allegations of
financial impropriety.
   The FBI's visit occurred at an awkward time for Gray; seeking to
move up in the Democratic hierarchy, he is a candidate for Coelho's
old job of whip.
   Hoyer said it all brought to mind tactics of the Nixon era:
``The Nixon years showed us the ability to use executive apparatus
in political campaigns.''
   Panetta called up the image of World War I trench warfare. He
said he saw ``a World War I mentality'' at play in the use of
ethics charges to savage the Democrats.
   If the get-even mood prevails, Gingrich stands out as the
Democrats' tempting target. A Democratic irritant in the best of
times, Gingrich is facing an investigation by the ethics committee
on complaints much like those that brought Wright down.
   Members of both sides who want a truce look to the sure-to-be
next speaker, Democrat Thomas Foley of Washington. He was
universally praised as a conciliator, an intellectual, fair-minded
and evenhanded. If he wants to add peacemaker to those accolades,
opportunity awaits his elevation Tuesday to speaker.

<TEXT>
   The smells of the land and hard-working
men filled the room as farmers took time off from the fields to
hear Solidarity's election pitch.
   The trio of candidates faced a stern crowd in this village 42
miles west of Warsaw, where cows graze almost to the edge of the
pavement and horse-drawn wagons rumble down the narrow roads.
   Like some other rural areas, Ojrzen remains a pocket of support
for the communist party. There are fewer than a half-dozen
Solidarity posters, with their flowing red script that has become a
trademark for the trade union born in Gdansk nine years ago.
   In his campaign stop, Solidarity candidate Benedykt
Pszczolkowski called for reforms ranging from better treatment of
farmers to reductions in the bloated communist-led government.
   But, facing more than 70 farmers in the community center Friday,
he was careful to avoid raising too many expectations in advance of
Sunday's elections for the parliament and a new Senate.
   ``We aren't making promises that the economy in Poland will
suddenly start to thrive,'' said the thin, bearded candidate,
dressed in a natty sport coat at the end of a frenzied, two-month
campaign.
   ``The people who control the farms don't know the problems. For
example, they're still buying machines that are too big for small
operations,'' said the candidate, himself a farmer with 60 acres in
the town of Pszczolki Gorne, 18 miles away.
   Pszczolkowski, 38, is hitting emotional issues in a country
where most farms remain in private hands, despite the communist
system.
   He is well aware that party officials also have been making the
rounds of hundreds of villages nationwide, promising to cure
chronic shortages if they're given another chance to govern.
   Shortages in this country of 38 million people are a daily curse
of life. They range from spare parts for tractors to food and vital
parts for dental care.
   ``They are telling fairy tales,'' the Solidarity candidate said
of the communist party candidates.
   Speaking from a makeshift podium of two tables pushed together
and covered by an aging green satin cloth, Pszczolkowski said
police should spend more time fighting crime than hunting down
unauthorized newspapers.
   Stanislaw Weglowski, 51, one of two other Solidarity candidates
appearing at the campaign stop, called for legal and economic
reforms.
   ``The factories are running at about 60 percent of their
capacity, because there is a shortage of raw materials,'' said
Weglowski, a parliament candidate.
   He also called for more housing, better education and public
access to the state-dominated mass media.
   The candidates are bound to find that demanding sweeping reforms
in virtually all aspects of public life is easier than implementing
them.
   Solidarity chief Lech Walesa has reminded his supporters that
plenty of ``hard work'' remains after Sunday's voting and the
run-off elections on June 18.
   When Pszczolkowski and the other candidates finished their
presentations, they opened the floor to questions.
   One farmer wanted to know whether it was true, as state-run
radio reported, that only ``criminals and communist party rejects''
joined Solidarity. Another testily asked whether Solidarity is a
union or a political party.
   A third man asked why the candidates failed to mention ``the
working class.'' Another jumped up and said the questioner was a
local official who gained office through the party system.
   Later, the Solidarity candidates headed nine miles down the road
to their final stop, the village of Sochocin.
   About 150 farmers crowded into the community center to listen to
the same speeches and pose many of the same questions as the
farmers in Ojrzen.
   Communist party candidates have been keeping a much lower
profile.
   ``Most people are for Solidarity,'' said retired farmer Sabina
Walczewska as she sat in a wooden cart drawn by a tractor.
``Everyone here says with Solidarity things are going to change for
the better _ maybe. Whether things really will be better, no one
knows.''
   The 73-year-old woman, her hands calloused from years on the
land without modern machines, said she plans to vote for Solidarity.

<HEAD>Drought May Be in Remission, But Food Prices Still Headed Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May rains have eased farmers' worries
about another drought and have lowered grain prices, but consumers
can probably still expect the biggest rise in food prices in eight
years, economists say.
   ``It's 200 percent better. Last year was grim,'' says Doug
Miller, who farms 350 acres in St. Joseph County in north-central
Indiana.
   Generous spring rains provided a breather from drought in the
Midwest and sent grain prices tumbling on commodity markets, but
they haven't come close to replenishing parched soil deep down or
washing out predictions for a food price increase of up to 7
percent.
   The drought of '88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and
soybean production 20 percent. Then, a dry winter, coupled with
dust storms and sub-arctic freezes, devastated winter wheat
production, with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor
or very poor shape as the harvest approaches.
   Then came the rainy spring. Conditions have been so wet that
planting has been delayed in such 1988 drought battlegrounds as
Indiana and Ohio. And the rain ensured that seeds that had been
planted got the chance to germinate.
   ``We're not desperate,'' says agronomist Garren Benson at Iowa
State University. ``The pressure is off for the time being.''
   Drought still plagues some parts of the country, ``but with the
rain we've had in the Corn Belt, we know it certainly isn't going
to be like last year,'' says economist Ralph Parlett at the
Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   The rains also have taken the edge off a drought-inspired rally
in grain markets, where prices rise when a scarce supply is
forecast and fall with each bit of good news from the fields. The
rising dollar also has been a factor in depressing grain prices.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, contracts calling for September
delivery of this summer's crop fell 9 percent for corn and almost
12 percent for soybeans between May 5 and Friday.
   At the height of the 1988 drought, corn for September 1988
delivery reached $3.64 a bushel. On Friday, the September 1989
contract closed at $2.42}. Soybeans peaked at $10.70 a bushel
nearly a year ago, but wound up last week at $6.50\.
   But while the drought scare has diminished and commodity prices
are retreating, economists are not rushing to rein in forecasts of
rising prices at supermarkets and restaurants.
   The USDA's Economic Research Service recently revised upward its
forecast for the consumer price index for food to a climb of 4
percent to 7 percent in 1989. In November, it had predicted a 3
percent to 5 percent increase in 1989 food prices.
   If inflation for food surpasses the 4.1 percent level of each of
the past two years, it will hit the highest mark since the 7.8
percent level of 1981.
   Parlett says drought aftereffects from 1988 are partly to blame.
With rising costs for feed grain, egg production was cut back,
pushing prices higher. Processed vegetable supplies also are tight
because of the drought.
   The drought's lingering effects on pastures in cattle country
also are taking their toll on food prices, by boosting feed costs
and forcing ranchers and farmers to reduce herds. The 99.5 million
head of cattle in the United States as the year began was the
lowest since 1961.
   To help beef producers, the Agriculture Department on Friday
announced steps to make some erosion-prone land available for
grazing and hay cutting.
   Factors unrelated to the drought that are contributing to higher
food prices include strong consumer demand and rising energy costs,
which increase processing and transportation expenses.
   Sung Won Song, chief economist at the Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis, said May rains have not changed his inflation outlook.
   ``The drought outlook for this year is yet to be seen,'' Song
said.
   Many regions are still powder dry below the top inches of soil,
he noted. Subsoil moisture is rated inadequate in at least 80
percent of Kansas and the Dakotas, more than 90 percent of northern
Missouri, and virtually all of Iowa and Nebraska.
   For corn and soybeans, June is a crucial month because it
normally is one of the wettest times of the growing season. A dry
June spells trouble in July and August, when such row crops are
developing quickly and need plenty of moisture.
   ``We had a lot of rain in the spring. Now it's so dry, I keep
planting, hoping it's going to rain,'' said former major league
pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, now a soybean farmer at Hertford,
N.C. ``We don't need 4 or 5 inches. We just need a little bit.''
   And in Kansas, rains were too little and too late to save much
of the winter wheat crop. Central, north central and northeast
parts of the state still are plagued with drought.
   ``A lot of people are thinking the drought is over,'' says Jack
May, meteorologist in charge of the Topeka office of the National
Weather Service. ``In May we had normal precipitation, and one
month of normal precipitation does not a drought break.''

<HEAD>Car Thief Gets Stiff Sentence: 10,000 Sentences</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When convicted car thief Timothy
Loggins walked out of an Alameda County courtroom, he had one
sentence in jail and 10,000 more on paper.
   After Loggins pleaded guilty last year to car theft, Municipal
Court Judge D. Ronald Hyde sentenced him to five weekends in the
county jail and ordered him as part of his probation to write this
sentence 10,000 times:
   ``If I don't own it, I won't take it.''
   This week, the judge ordered Loggins, 20, held without bail in
the jail after he failed to complete the literary assignment,
despite Loggins' sworn claim that he had completed 3,000 sentences.
   Hyde said nothing was produced for the court to see. He also
ordered Loggins to return every day to the
Livermore-Pleasanton-Dublin Municipal Court holding cell to
complete his writing assignment.
   Hyde said that when he last checked Friday, Loggins had
completed about 1,400 sentences.
   Hyde also said Loggins is taking his writing assignment ``in
good spirits'' and will benefit from it.
   ``I want him to feel that this repetitive writing is about as
foolish as what he did,'' Hyde said. ``I want people to know that
if you steal, you're going to pay a price, and it isn't always
jail.''

   The FBI is sending an agent to the site of the
August plane crash that killed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq and U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, an agency official
confirmed.
   The agent will be sent within a week, nearly 10 months after the
FBI was initially shut out of the investigation, said Oliver B.
Revell, executive assistant director for investigations.
   The aim will be to seek evidence at the site where the plane
went down Aug. 17, killing the two officials and 27 others,
including Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the chief U.S. defense
representative to Pakistan.
   Pakistan's official report on the crash has been under review by
the FBI since October. It concludes that sabotage was the cause but
does not pinpoint those responsible.
   Revell said the FBI has completed its review of the report.
   ``We have conducted all of our interviews of U.S. participants
and witnesses and we are dispatching an agent to go on-scene to
conduct an on-scene evaluation and we will go from there,'' he said.
   He said the decision to keep the FBI out of the investigation
appears to have come from within the National Security Council.
``The Pakistanis as we understand would have agreed for us to be
there, but it was never presented to them,'' he said.
   ``I personally believe that this was a very unique situation, a
very sensitive location with a U.s. ally teetering on the brink,''
Revell said. ``People who did not know the requirements of the
(anti-terrorism) law made a decision without understanding the
ramifications of the decision.''
   In more recent terrorist incidents, there has been cooperation
between the State Department and the FBI, he said.
   Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., has been critical of the FBI's
exclusion from the investigation, saying it is the only agency with
the expertise to determine whether Zia and Raphel were victims of
terrorism.
   ``Pakistan is one of the key diplomatic posts,'' said Hughes.
``Everybody said right away we couldn't rule out sabotage. A proper
criminal investigation was not carried out, whether for national
security reasons, a turf battle, an understanding with the
Pakistanis or an absolute blunder.''
   Hughes had known Raphel, a native of Atlantic City, N.J., and
highly respected member of the diplomatic corps.
   ``I met Arnold before he went to Pakistan,'' Hughes said. ``He
was probably one of the rising stars.''
   Hughes' crime subcommittee has been trying to determine why the
State Department on Aug. 21 at first granted and then denied the
Federal Bureau of Investigation permission to investigate the crash.
   ``It's not the first time I've seen potential criminal
investigations thwarted,'' Hughes said. ``It's obvious somebody
bungled the job.''
   ``In this instance, nobody brought in any criminal
investigators, no forensics experts, no autopsies were done on the
pilots,'' he said. ``They did find foreign substances on the plane
_ components suitable for a medium-size incendiary device which are
not explained away.''

<HEAD>12,000 Gather for Biggest AIDS Conference Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When 12,000 people gather Sunday for the biggest
AIDS conference ever, they will hear grim reports on the social and
economic toll of the epidemic but little encouragement about the
medical race to stop it.
   The Fifth International Conference on AIDS is a gathering of all
of the big-name researchers and physicians, as well as their
supporting casts, who this decade have made AIDS a profession and
livelihood as well as a tragedy.
   The obvious and easy discoveries have been made, so the product
of the conference will be thousands of updates on the painstakingly
tiny steps necessary for science to learn to thwart the AIDS virus
and repair its destruction.
   No clearly superior successor to AZT, the only approved AIDS
drug, is expected to emerge from the 4,500 planned presentations,
nor is there likely to be an effective vaccine to protect people
from catching HIV, the AIDS virus.
   ``I am not expecting any big announcements out of this
conference, unfortunately, in terms of new drugs capable of making
a real difference over the next two years,'' said Dr. Mark Wainberg
of McGill University. ``I think we will see a lot of leads for the
future, but I don't think it likely we will have major cures or
vaccines announced.''
   In 1985, 3,200 people gathered in Atlanta for the first big AIDS
meeting. At the time, 9,000 cases of AIDS had been reported in the
United States. Expected at the Montreal meeting, which runs through
Friday, are 10,000 AIDS experts, 1,000 reporters and 1,000
exhibitors. The total of U.S. AIDS cases is nearing 100,000.
   With the growing numbers has come a realization that acquired
immune deficiency syndrome is far more than a medical problem.
Although 65 percent of the presentations will concern the
biological and medical intricacies of AIDS, this year's conference
is the first to put a major emphasis on other aspects of the
epidemic, including its psychological impact, costs, ethical
dilemmas, education and legal questions.
   ``We encourage this marrying of disciplines,'' said Dr. Alastair
J. Clayton, director general of the federal center for AIDS in
Ottawa. ``We are trying in this conference to keep the behavioral
and biomedical sciences working together. We all want to control
the spread of HIV infection in our society and use every means we
can.''
   Among other things, the meeting will hold sessions on AIDS
legislation around the world, the hospital costs of the disease,
the role of churches, how companies deal with the disease, whether
HIV-infected people should be allowed to adopt children, and
whether such people's infections should be kept confidential if
they are sexually irresponsible.
   Ivan Head, the conference chairman, said the decision to open
the gathering to non-medical subjects was made even before last
year's annual meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, at the urging of its
co-sponsor, the World Health Organization.
   ``There was a recognition that at the present pace of scientific
research, there is likely to be considerable delay until we can
come to terms with the virus in a scientific fashion,'' said Head,
who is chairman of Canada's International Development Research
Center. ``In the interim, we have to recognize these societal
concerns.''
   However, some researchers are uneasy about the vast scope of the
meeting and the blurring of its focus on science.
   Wainberg, who is coordinating the meeting's research
presentations, said that scientists undoubtedly will learn more
about the ethics and economics of AIDS and its impact on Third
World countries.
   But he added, ``I am afraid we may reach the conclusion that we
tried to do too much. This meeting has tried to be all things to
all people. There is a part of me that feels uneasy about it, but
we'll see.''
   Dr. Richard Morisset of Montreal's Hotel-Dieu Hospital, the
program chairman, agreed this is a familiar complaint. But he
added, ``There will be more papers and posters in biomedicine than
at any other meeting. I think the criticism is unimportant.''

   ``Indiana Jones'' star Harrison Ford will be
visiting a different kind of temple of doom this week as he
observes murder trials in Detroit Recorder's Court to prepare for a
film role as a prosecutor.
   Ford has been cast as Rozat ``Rusty'' Sabich, a chief assistant
prosecutor accused of murder in ``Presumed Innocent,'' a movie
based on the Scott Turow novel of the same name.
   Mirage Productions in March chose Detroit as a location for the
film's street scenes. Within a month, the Michigan Prosecutors'
Association began mailing Ford training films.
   Chief Assistant Prosecutor George Ward would not comment on
details of Ford's visit, which begins Monday, but he didn't try to
hide his excitement.
   ``I feel lucky, that of all the chief assistants in the country,
my job is being used as a model,'' Ward said. ``Especially someone
like Harrison Ford. He's one of the hottest box office
personalities, and he's at the peak of his popularity.''
   Ford starred in last year's box-office hit ``Working Girl,'' and
his current film, ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' already
has grossed $50 million. He previously starred in ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark'' and ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''

   Country singer Conway Twitty says his
career is on an upswing even after four decades on stage.
   Twitty, 55, is scheduled to appear this summer on Johnny
Carson's and Pat Sajak's late night TV talk shows. He appeared on
David Letterman's show earlier this year and Reader's Digest is
excerpting his biography.
   ``We're going to take my career up one more little level,'' he
said in an interview.
   He said his last three albums have been his best.
   ``I feel like I'm singing better than I ever have in my life,''
Twitty said.
   He has been the duet partner of country star Loretta Lynn and
recorded solo hits such as ``It's Only Make Believe,'' ``Hello
Darlin''' and ``You've Never Been This Far Before.''

   Poet Allen Ginsburg and musician
Richie Havens are scheduled to appear at a tribute June 10 for the
late radical activist Abbie Hoffman.
   The gathering, called ``Steal This Picnic'' in a twist on
Hoffman's ``Steal This Book,'' is sponsored by Del-AWARE Unlimited,
an environmental group. Hoffman worked with the group in an
unsuccessful attempt to stop Philadelphia Electric Co. from
building the Point Pleasant pumping station on the Delaware River.
   The state parks commission voted last month to allow the
gathering at Washington Crossing State Park despite objections of
its chairwoman, Ann Hawkes Hutton. She contended the historic park
was an inappropriate site for a memorial service for a man who
spent seven years as a fugitive from justice and who pleaded guilty
to possession of cocaine.
   Hoffman committed suicide at his home on April 12.

   The Soviet people have long thrived on
so-called black humor, biting satire that make light of some of the
more onerous aspects of a life characterized by shortages and
corruption.
   Now the editors of the leading Soviet humor magazine,
``Krokodil,'' have published an English-language collection of
satirical cartoons the magazine's editor, Aleksey Pyanov says he
hopes will help ``destroy the myth that Soviet people are gloomy,
withdrawn and stern.''
   The weekly ``Krokodil'' reaches an enormous audience in the
Soviet Union, with a circulation of 5.3 million. By comparison,
Time has a circulation in the United Sates of 4.7 million and
Newsweek 3.3 million.
   The wide-ranging collection of 185 cartoons from ``Krokodil'' _
covering topics from marital humor to environmental problems _ is
being made available to American readers in the book, ``Soviet
Humor.''
   The most poignant sketches, ones that may surprise Western
readers, are those depicting social problems, such as alcoholism or
prostitution, the housing shortage, lethargic bureaucrats and
workers.
   All are topics that ``Krokodil'' embraced satirically before it
was politically safe to tackle them directly in official Soviet
newspapers.
   Several selections reflect the terror of Stalinism, when a
midnight knock at the door could mean a one-way ticket to Siberia.
In one, a wife consoles her husband that a noise from the next room
is ``not the police. It's just burglars.''
   In another, three road workers idle beneath a sign alerting
motorists to beware of roadwork. In the final frame, the laborer
depicted in the sign climbs down and bends his back to work, to the
amazement of the idlers.
   Americans with memories of a bad restaurant meal might identify
with the ``Krokodil'' cartoon of a slovenly chef handing a plate to
a waitress with the comment: ``Palm this off on somebody _ I am
afraid to taste it.''
   Another cartoon helps explain shortages in Soviet restaurants.
As the manager leaves, loaded down with fish, ham and other
goodies, the chef calls to the waitress: ``Klava, the boss has left
for the day. Take all the meat and fish items off the menu.''
   A number of cartoons are more tragic than funny. A woman walks
down the street, carrying groceries in one hand and leading a child
with the other. The child's far hand is raised, grasping a shadow
of a man, who with his other hand clutches a half-empty bottle of
vodka.

<TEXT>
   A woman who plucked out a teen-ager's
eye during an exorcism won't have to go to jail after all, says the
judge who sentenced her last year to a six-month term.
   District Judge Mike McDonald ordered Andrea Cowan, who was
convicted in June 1988 of cruelty to a juvenile, to buy an $850
artificial eye for the boy.
   Mrs. Cowan was pregnant when McDonald sentenced her in October
1988, and he said she would not have to go to jail until after she
gave birth.
   In the meantime, McDonald said Friday, the prosecutor urged him
not to send Mrs. Cowan to jail. She has expressed remorse and her
probation officer describes her as an ideal candidate for
probation, the judge said.
   Mrs. Cowan could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison on
the cruelty charge.
   McDonald said he originally ordered Mrs. Cowan to serve jail
time, as well as doing 300 hours of community service and paying
nearly $4,000 in restitution, to punish her for committing a crime
in the name of Christianity.
   ``In this day of the various scandals which have been widely
publicized, the last thing the Christian cause needs is this type
of additional adverse publicity,'' McDonald said at the time.

   Chinese troops fired on protesters and smashed
through barricades with tanks to reach Tiananmen Square early
Sunday. At least 13 people were reported killed and scores injured.
   A doctor at a small hospital near where the clashes occurred
said about 100 people were treated for injuries and that 12 had
died. A soldier was killed in another part of the city when he was
run over by a tank racing to the square.
   Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side
of the vast square, which has been occupied by pro-democracy
protesters for three weeks. Until Saturday, the tense standoff had
been generally peaceful, even though the students were repeatedly
ordered to leave the square and end the protest.
   Students threw bottles and other objects at soldiers who
advanced Saturday night, while troops beat those who obstructed
their path with sticks.
   Another group of more than 1,000 troops gained a foothold on the
southwest corner of the vast square, while throngs of students and
supporters tried to block their movement.
   A tank pulled up next to the Great Hall of the People, on the
western side of the square, but it was besieged by crowds pelting
it with rocks.
   Another tank roared down Changan Avenue, the main street, from
the east, followed by thousands of shouting people on bicycles.
Other tanks crashed through barricades in the west.
   The street where the gunfire took place was speckled with blood.
Crowds broke up the pavement to throw stones at the troops and set
one military bus on fire.
   Late Saturday, a convoy of at least 40 trucks with several
thousand troops broke through the barricades set up by people and
began moving slowly down Changan Avenue toward the square.
   Shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday (noon EDT Saturday) troops broke
through a flaming barricade at the Xidan intersection, about one
mile west of the square.
   A man at the intersection about a mile west of the square
received a gunshot wound in the chest as truckloads of troops
rammed through barricades set up by citizens. A medical student on
the scene said the man's heart had stopped beating and there was
little hope for his survival.
   About 6,000 people trying to block the path of the troops were
beaten by riot police and troops and attacked with tear gas.
Citizens had set fire to public buses parked across the road, but
the army trucks slammed through.
   At least five people were taken away after being hit by the fire
in the initial incident. More than a dozen others were bleeding
from wounds suffered when troops beat people in the crowd.
   One 28-year-old worker hit by a bullet in the leg said, ``the
government is fascist. How can they do this to me? How can they do
this to the people?''
   The attack on protesters first began about 8 p.m. Saturday when
thousands of Beijing citizens trying to push the troops back began
hurling stones. Police retaliated by attacking people with
truncheons and electric cattle prods, firing tear gas and finally
opening fire.
   About 5,000 troops made a dash for the square from the east
earlier in the evening, but they were turned back and headed up a
side street.
   One student speaking in a cracked voice over a loudspeaker on
the square urged students not to leave and said, ``We Chinese will
persist to the end. If we die at Tiananmen Square, then so be it.''
   About 200,000 people were gathered on the square to protect the
thousands of students who have staged a pro-democracy sit-in there
since May 13.
   The pro-democracy protests began on April 15 with a simple call
by students for talks on increasing social freedoms and ending
official corruption. They peaked during the week of May 15, when
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited the country and up to
1 million poured into the streets.
   The government declared martial law on May 20 and troops
attempted to advance on the square, but they were driven back by
masses of average citizens sympathetic to the protesters.
   The protest led to a power struggle in the government, with
hardliners such as senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng
apparently winning control.
   The shooting Saturday night came after an earlier attempt to
quell the protests failed earlier in the day. Hundreds of police
had fired tear gas on crowds for the first time in seven weeks of
pro-democracy protests.
   Witnesses said riot troops beat at least 30 people east of
Tiananmen Square. But hundreds of thousands of people took to the
streets to protect the students.
   A detachment of 5,000 troops, surrounded by taunting crowds one
block off the square, began hitting people with belts. During the
short fracas, people burst into tears and the crowd shouted ``You
can't hit the people!''
   Security forces made pre-dawn and afternoon advances on the
square but failed to dislodge the students, who have occupied the
100-acre plaza since May 13.
   Riot police also beat students and others with nightsticks in
afternoon attacks both to the east and west of the square, the
symbolic center of power in China. Some protesters tossed rocks at
the police.
   At least 13 people were seen with bloodied heads and bodies.
Witnesses said two truckloads of riot police with shields and
sticks began beating people outside the Beijing Hotel east of the
square, injuring 30 people.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who advocated
concessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and is
under house arrest. But Chinese and diplomatic sources said it was
unclear whether hard-liners had enough support among the rest of
the party leadership to purge Zhao from the government.

   Eighteen years after authorities say John
E. List methodically shot his family to death, people here see an
end to the tale that has haunted this quiet, wealthy suburb.
   The former Sunday school teacher was arrested in Richmond, Va.,
last Thursday, where he had been living with a second wife of four
years and working as an accountant.
   Nearly two decades of lead-chasing in every state, Europe and
South America were terminated by a simple anonymous tip following a
broadcast of the case on the television show ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   Police Chief Anthony Scutti said the murders left a black mark
on the town of 32,000, 25 miles from New York City. The arrest
helped fade that mark.
   ``If they had a giant microphone in town, you would have heard a
giant sigh of relief,'' Scutti said. When the chief went to an
awards dinner the night of the arrest, he was greeted with a
spontaneous standing ovation.
   ``I think that reflected the feeling of all of us,'' he said.
   On Dec. 7, 1971, police who had been alerted by worried
neighbors found the bodies of List's wife and three children lying
on sleeping bags on the ballroom floor of the family's 18-room
mansion. Cloths covered the faces of Helen, 45; Patricia, 16; John
Jr. 15; and Frederick, 13. The body of List's 85-year-old mother,
Alma, was found in an upstairs closet.
   All five had been shot in the head. They apparently had been
dead nearly a month. List, who had held jobs as an accountant and
insurance salesman and was apparently beset by financial and family
problems, had vanished.
   In many ways, the List case worked its way into the town's
consciousness. Teen-agers seeking excitement would cruise by the
house, until it mysteriously burned down a year after the deaths.
Almost every year, newspapers would run articles on the crime's
anniversary.
   And people remembered.
   Scutti, then a sergeant, recalled bringing Patricia List to the
stationhouse late one night several months before her death. She
had slipped out the window and was going to meet a friend.
   ``Lo and behold, he comes in at 2:30 in the morning dressed in a
business suit to pick up his daughter,'' Scutti said. List, Scutti
said, sometimes dressed the same way to mow his lawn.
   Claudia Haller remembered being interviewed by List for a
teaching job at the primary school connected with the Redeemer
Lutheran Church.
   The red-brick, slate-roofed church, where List taught Sunday
school, was just about the only community tie he had. Church was a
constant: He used pastors as references for jobs and a gun permit
three weeks before the crime. List met his second wife at a Denver
church function in 1977, authorities said. ``I felt that he was a
very intellectual man. He was just very calm and collected. You
could see he was a very religious man, too,'' Mrs. Haller said. He
was also a private man, given to eating lunch alone at work, said
Westfield detective Lt. Bernard Tracy.
   Now that one mystery _ List's whereabouts _ has been solved,
another remains: why.
   List left letters, as yet undisclosed, to his pastor and others
explaining his actions. List reportedly believed his family was
falling away from their religion and had to be killed for their own
good.
   A newspaper at the time included quotations from Brenda Taylor,
Helen List's daughter by a previous husband who had died in the
Korean War. Miss Taylor said the marriage with List was filled with
tension because her mother was psychologically unstable and had a
drinking problem.
   List's Lutheran pastor in Rochester, N.Y., during the early
1960s said more tension was created by Mrs. List's comparison of
the meek List with her first husband, ``a strong military man.''
   Toward the end, Mrs. List was bedridden for months and List's
financial problems were mounting. He was upset with his daughter's
desire to become an actress and attachment to a young man
considered in the ``wrong crowd,'' said James Moran, police chief
at the time.
   The young man for several years left flowers at the family's
grave in Fairview Cemetery, where a single headstone records List's
wife and children.
   ``I hope it ends for him more than it does for us,'' said Mark
Pletscher of Fanwood, who was two years behind John Jr. in school.
``I hope he comes to grips with this whole thing.''

   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, recovering from surgery for bleeding in his digestive
system, has developed a ``complication,'' Tehran radio reported
Saturday.
   The radio gave no details of the deterioration in the
86-year-old spiritual leader's condition but urged the nation to
pray for his recovery.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, contained a statement from
Khomeini's office that said:
   ``At 3:00 p.m. (7:30 a.m. EDT) on Saturday a complication arose
in the Imam's condition, which the doctors are trying to control.
We urge the nation to pray for the Imam's health and hope that
their prayers will be answered.''
   The deterioration in Khomeini's condition followed reports over
the past five days that he was making a normal recovery.
   Khomeini underwent surgery 11 days ago to control intestinal
bleeding.
   A few days after the operation, Tehran television, also
monitored in Nicosia, said a ``slight cardiac complication'' had
arisen, but that it had been relieved the next day.
   Khomeini is referred to by Iranians as the Imam, or spiritual
leader.
   On Thursday, Khomeini was allowed out of bed in a Tehran
hospital and visited with friends and relatives outside the
building, the television said. It showed film of the revolutionary
patriarch sitting outside performing his prayers. The report quoted
doctors as saying Khomeini's condition was ``very satisfactory''
and that he was expected to make a complete recovery.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's
Holy Warriors, said in a statement earlier this week that Khomeini
suffered a heart attack last Saturday. The statement said the heart
attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum,
part of the small intestine close to the stomach. The Mujahedeen's
claim could not be independently confirmed.
   Khomeini reportedly has been ailing since he had a heart attack
in 1986.
   Since then he has rarely been seen outside his home in the north
Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   Khomeini, the son of a religious leader from a village southwest
of Tehran, taught for years at Qom, the center of Shiite teaching
in Iran.
   He attracted attention for his independent-mindedness and stern
moral example and soon became a focus for opposition to the
monarchy in Iran.
   He was sent into exile in November 1964, first to Turkey, then
to Iraq, where he settled in the Shiite shrine city of Najaf. He
later moved to France.
   Khomeini emerged in 1978 as the moral leader of a burgeoning
revolution against the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi that was
organized through Iran's Shiite clergymen and their followers.
   He returned to Tehran in February 1979 after the Shah fled the
country and became the supreme head of Iran's Islamic revolution
for life.
   Khomeini developed into a skilled politician balancing the
different Iranian factions against each other but never losing his
power as leader of the theocratic state.
   When Iran's eight year war with Iraq ended in a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire in August, there was speculation Khomeini would back
more moderate members of the Iranian regime in their efforts to
rebuild the war-ravaged country.
   But his radicalism re-emerged in February with a purge of those
members of the hierarchy and a call for the death of British author
Salman Rushdie for his irreverant portrayal of Islam in his novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners blasted the Christian
enclave with 400 howitzer shells at dawn Saturday, and five
artillery rounds crashed in Moslem west Beirut in the most serious
violations of a 3-week-old cease-fire.
   A spokesman for Gen. Michel Aoun denied that his mainly
Christian army troops fired on west Beirut. It was the first attack
on west Beirut since the Arab League called the May 11 cease-fire.
   But the spokesman warned: ``We won't remain idle if the
cease-fire violations persist.''
   No casualties were reported. Police said they could not
determine who fired on the Moslem sector, but Moslem-run Voice of
the Nation radio blamed Aoun's army.
   An aide to Aoun accused the Syrians of ``shelling both sectors
of Beirut so that our citizens in the western sector would have the
impression that we are shelling them.''
   The barrage on the Christians focused on the coastal stretch
north of Beirut, the presidential palace and nearby districts.
   In west Beirut, shells exploded along the seaside Raouche
boulevard. Two shells crashed close to the American University
campus.
   Aoun's aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Arab
League talks on Lebanon being held Sunday in Morocco will be
decisive.
   ``Peace will prevail if the leaders adopt a clear decision on
consolidating the cease-fire and lifting the blockades,'' he said.
   ``If they fail to stop Syrian violation of the cease-fire, then
we will have to fire back,'' he added.
   King Hassan II of Morocco will host the talks with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. An Arab
League summit gave the three men six months to stabilize the May 11
truce and find a political settlement to Lebanon's 14-year civil
war.
   The daily An-Nahar newspaper said the three plan to set up an
office in Beirut.
   It said their foreign ministers will hold talks in Baghdad,
Damascus and Beirut to help consolidate the cease-fire.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq supports Aoun's ``war of
liberation'' to drive out of Lebanon some 40,000 Syrian troops
deployed under a 1976 Arab League peace-keeping mandate. Aoun and
his supporters accuse the Syrians of betraying the mandate by
siding with the Moslems.
   Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Arab socialist
Baath party. At least 360 people have been killed and nearly 1,400
have been wounded since the latest fighting erupted March 8, two
days after Aoun blockaded south Beirut ports run by Syrian-backed
militias. The illegal harbors deprive the state treasury of $100
million in customs dues annually.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Syrian-backed militia retaliated
by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian heartland northeast of
Beirut.
   Syrian gunners later joined in the shelling and enforced a siege
of the enclave where 1 million Christians live.

<HEAD>Soviets Charge Britain With Bugging Soviet Building, Apartments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Saturday accused Britain of
bugging its trade delegation building in London and the apartments
of Soviet diplomats.
   The Foreign Office denied the allegation, which further strained
relations between the countries.
   Two weeks ago, Britain accused eight Soviet diplomats and three
journalists of spying and expelled them. The Soviet Union responded
with identical charges and expulsions.
   Soviet diplomats said at a news conference at their embassy on
Saturday that construction work on the trade delegation building
revealed that it was ``honeycombed'' with bugging devices planted
in the concrete walls and even deep underground.
   Soviet Ambassador Leonid Zamyatin went to the Foreign Office in
the afternoon to deliver ``a vigorous protest,'' the diplomats said.
   The Soviets claimed the electronic devices were so powerful that
they would harm the health of Soviet citizens and Britons living
nearby. He did not explain how.
   First Secretary Alexander Smaguin said some of the alleged bugs
``were discovered very recently.''
   ``They were discovered during maintenance and repair work
carried out over some period of time by Soviet construction
workers,'' he said.
   ``Obviously these devices could only be installed during the
contruction of the building about 15 years ago,'' said Nickolai
Kossov, another first secretary.
   The Soviets displayed photographs of the alleged eavesdropping
devices, graphics of where they were found and examples of the
devices themselves.
   Reporters and photographers later were taken by bus to one of
the diplomat's flats where the devices were allegedly found.
   A statement issued by Soviet Counselor Gregory Karasin said:
``Facts show that in Great Britain there remain active forces, keen
on bringing our relations back to the times of the Cold War,
reanimating the `enemy image' of the Soviet Union.''
   He said the surveillance amounted to ``rude intrusion in private
lives of Soviet citizens working in Britain.''
   ``By expert opinion, the mode of operation of many of the
discovered devices involved the use of high-powered directional
radio emissions damaging to the health of both Soviet personnel and
British people living locally,'' Karasin said.
   After Zamyatin's 10-minute meeting with Sir Patrick Wright,
permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, the department issued a
statement that said Wright was certain the British government had
nothing to do with any bugging devices found on Soviet property.
   ``Devices of this sort are widely available both in this country
and, indeed, in Moscow,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   Oxford graduates in their black academic
robes gathered among the university's ancient spires on Saturday
and elected Irish poet Seamus Heaney to the prestigious post of
professor of poetry.
   Heaney, an award-winning poet and favorite of the university's
arts establishment, was born in Northern Ireland and lives in
Dublin and the United States, where he is a professor at Harvard
University. He is 50.
   None of the poets was present when the announcement was made
outside the university's divinity school.
   Heaney, who won 316 of the 485 total votes cast Thursday and
Saturday, had always been heavily favored for the professorship,
one of the university's least arduous posts. It requires three
lectures for each of its five years.
   Heaney could not be reached for comment. Telephone calls to his
office in Boston went unanswered, and his home telephone number was
not listed.
   The highly regarded and popular poet was nominated by Oxford
novelist Dame Iris Murdoch, by three previous holders of the
professorship and by Oxford's most influential English literature
specialists.
   In addition to his poetry, Heaney has published books of
literary criticsm and has long experience teaching. A member of the
Irish Academy of Letters, he became Boylston Professor of Rhetoric
and Oratory at Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1985.
   Competition for the professorship, though dignified, has been
intense.
   Charles H. Sisson, a 75-year-old poet, author and translator was
a notable contender and garnered 96 votes.
   An attention-getting outsider was 30-year-old Rastafarian reggae
poet Benjamin Zephaniah, who was a candidate for the post of writer
in residence at Cambridge University's Trinity College in 1986 and
only narrowly missed.
   He had the backing of younger graduates but, as columnist Andrew
Brown wrote in The Independent newspaper: ``Dialect is notoriously
difficult to transliterate in English ... (so) his work looks no
more than silly on paper, but that is not how he is to be judged.''
   ``He is said to be very impressive in live performance,'' Brown
added.
   Zephaniah won 60 votes.
   He was followed by Duncan McCann, with nine votes. McCann lost
to current professor Peter Levi five years ago.
   McCann was so indignant at being referred to as ``the barroom
poet'' because of his nomination by friends from The King's Arms in
Oxford that some papers took to calling him ``not the barroom
poet.''
   In addition to the three lectures the poetry professor gives
each year, he must judge three English poetry and essay
competitions for students and give a public oration every other
year.
   From the establishment of the professorship in 1708 until 1972,
the oration had to be delivered in Latin _ a task which alone might
merit the professor's annual stipend of $4,960.
   But in 1972 Roy Fuller got away with delivering his in English
and successors have followed suit. Levi delivered his last oration
in verse.
   Previous sitters in the illustrious poetry chair have included
W.H. Auden, Robert Graves and Edmund Blunden.

<HEAD>Desk Sells For $12.1 Million; Sets New Furniture Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mahogany desk and bookcase made in the 1760s
sold at auction Saturday for $12.1 million, setting a world record
for a piece of furniture, Christie's auction house said.
   The Chippendale secretary was bought by Harold Sack, a New York
dealer, after a three-way bidding contest that lasted about a
minute, said Dana Micucci, a spokeswoman for Christie's.
   ``It was a very dynamic event. People rushed up to Sack. And
basically the sale stopped while they applauded him,'' she said.
   The desk, made for Nicholas Brown of Rhode Island, is attributed
to John Goddard, a renowned cabinetmaker from Newport, R.I. Nine
known Goddard six-shell secretaries are known to exist.
   The desk soars to a dramatic 113 inches. The upper section is
divided into three blocked cupboard doors, each carved with a
shell. The lower case has a slant lid blocked and carved with three
shells.
   ``This particular piece is probably the consummate example of
18th century American furniture,'' said Dean Failey, head of
Christie's American decorative arts department. ``It is perhaps
America's finest contribution in the history of furniture making.''
   The auction house had predicted that the desk would sell for $3
million to $5 million. The $12.1 million includes Christie's 10
percent commission.
   The previous record for a piece of furniture was held by Marie
Antoinette's console table, which sold for $2.97 million last
November in London. The $12.1 million is the highest price paid for
any art object other than a painting, according to the auction
house.
   Goddard made the desk for Brown and his wife, whom he married in
1762, Brown family correspondence indicates. The family made its
fortune in shipping and commerce in Providence, R.I.
   The desk remained in the Brown family until December 1988, when
a descendant and namesake of the original owner, retired Capt.
Nicholas Brown of Baltimore, donated it to the John Nicholas Brown
Center for the Study of American Civilization in Providence.
   The center sold the piece of furniture because it needed funds
to repair its headquarters, the Nightingale-Brown House, where the
family lived until 1983, said Robert P. Emlen, executive director
of the center.

<HEAD>Ousted Sudanese Leader Still Plots to Seize Back Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years after he was ousted in a palace
coup, Sudan's former president, Gaafar Nimeiri, spends his time in
large, slightly decrepit villa, plotting to seize power again.
   He has aged visibly and put on weight during the years as a
political outcast in Cairo. The villa and the guards patrolling it
with automatic weapons are courtesy of the Egyptian government,
which granted Nimeiri political asylum after he was stranded in
Cairo by his defense minister's coup.
   Nimeiri had just returned from an aid-seeking visit to
Washington on April 6, 1985 when Gen. Abdul-Rahman Swareddahab
sided with civil disobedience campaigners to oust him.
   Nimeiri had been in power 16 years.
   During a rare interview Friday, the former strongman wore a
white suit instead of the military uniform or traditional flowing
white robes he favored as president of Africa's largest country.
   He spoke of his anger at his defense minister's betrayal, his
life as an exile, the ``government of thieves'' ruling his country
and his advice to Sudanese supporters: ``Take over the power.''
   The 59-year-old Nimeiri said he socializes mostly with Sudanese
who live in Egypt or visit Cairo and has little contact with his
Egyptian benefactors other than requesting renovations for the
villa.
   His kinky hair has turned almost totally white behind his
receding hairline. His waistline has expanded into a pot belly.
   Nimeiri claimed overwhelming support in Sudan and urged his
countrymen to overthrow Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, elected in 1986
in balloting overseen by Swareddahab's transitional military
government.
   ``I have felt hurt by the news I get from Sudan and about the
suffering of the Sudanese people,'' Nimeiri said.
   ``Those who were deceived now call for the regime of Gaafar
Nimeiri. ... I have received numerous letters and people, all
asking me to save Sudan after it has fallen in a deep abyss as they
put it.''
   Sudan was near bankruptcy when Nimeiri was overthrown, and
little has changed. Experts blame a succession of weak coalitions'
reticence to undertake reforms and work decisively to end a civil
war that began in 1983.
   Sudanese appear disillusioned by Mahdi's lack of progress, and
some have been heard to speak wistfully of the Nimeiri era, but
there is no visible support for the ousted president on the streets.
   Nimeiri insisted in the interview that the Sudan he ruled was
among the world's most democratic and prosperous countries. But in
1985, thousands of Sudanese danced in the streets after
demonstrations against high prices, Islamic law and Nimeiri's
iron-fisted security policies led to the coup.
   Similar demonstrations have rocked the country this year and,
under pressure from the military, Mahdi was forced to form a
broader-based coalition and prepare to negotiate with the rebels.
   Mahdi's government has convicted several members of Nimeiri's
military regime for corruption and has a standing request that
Egypt return the field marshal for trial. President Hosni Mubarak
has refused, invoking Egypt's long tradition of providing political
asylum.
   Nimeiri's presence in Cairo has strained Egypt's relations with
its southern neighbor.
   Twice the former leader has broken his hosts' ban on political
activity. In 1985, he sent recorded messages to Sudan urging people
to restore his power.
   This year, he has given a handful of interviews and admitted
sending tapes and written speeches to Sudan to mark the 20th
anniversary of his seizure of power.
   Nimeiri said Cairo has expressed displeasure, ``but the pressure
on me from the Sudanese people does not allow me to keep my word to
the Egyptian government.
   ``I am not urging the people to overthrow the government. I am
urging them to take over the power.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union convened a full-time legislature
Saturday after eight days of raucous parliamentary debate, which
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said showed how his reforms activate
people.
   At its first session, the 271-member Soviet of the Union, one of
two chambers of the Supreme Soviet legislature, chose economist
Yevgeny M. Primakov as chairman and proposed creating four
commissions and 14 committees, including one to oversee the KGB
secret police.
   Primakov said the committees are modeled in part on the U.S.
Congress.
   The meeting, broadcast to the nation, brought the Soviet Union
into the second phase of its adventure in democracy. The larger
Congress of People's Deputies, the parliament, adjourned until
Monday after boisterous debate that brought up a catalogue of
problems with Gorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, of Soviet
economy and society.
   ``During the days of the Congress' work, I became sure that
perestroika changes people fast,'' the 58-year-old Soviet leader
told legislators Saturday. He said the 2,250 deputies, most elected
in competitive balloting for the first time in 70 years, are
``wonderful people, different people, dissimilar people very
interested in things starting to change in the country for the
better.''
   ``How these perestroika processes bring out, crystallize these
new cadres!'' he said.
   The Soviet of the Union met for just one day. The other chamber,
the Soviet of Nationalities, meets Monday, and a joint session is
scheduled Tuesday to consider the Communist Party's nomination of
Politburo member Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to continue as premier.
   The two chambers replace a larger parliament that automatically
approved government decisions.
   Primakov urged the new Supreme Soviet to ``exercise real control
over executive organs.''
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov said the committee on defense
and state security, which will oversee the KGB, will meet less
frequently and have fewer members than others.
   Roy A. Medvedev, a legislator and historian who has written
extensively about dictator Josef Stalin's secret police and mass
terror, said the committee can demand explanations of any KGB
official and recommend changing KGB decisions. But he said it was
too soon to tell if it can exercise true control over the secretive
agency.
   ``Everything depends on its composition. If it is made up of
people who are ... not independent, who are timid people, people
who don't have enough will or intellectual abilities, then of
course it will be a committee that can't completely carry out its
functions,'' Medvedev said in an interview.
   KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov said Thursday he supports
legislative authority over his agency.
   Some parliamentarians have expressed concern that few
progressive-minded people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet.
Saturday's session was much tamer than the Congress, but dissent
was evident.
   Marju Lauristin, from the grassroots People's Front of Estonia,
joined two Lithuanians in abstaining in the Primakov vote, because,
she said, he did not reject description of the Soviet Union as an
empire or power. Baltic activists want a degree of sovereignty for
the 15 Soviet republics.
   There were no votes against Primakov. He was the only candidate.

   They met on the bus and became friends on
the bus. So when it came to getting married Saturday, it seemed
only natural that Claude Methot and Jan Cole should board the Metro
to take their vows.
   The couple left a wake of smiles and horn-honking motorists as
their wedding bus cruised to a luncheon after the onboard ceremony.
The bus was decked out with crepe paper, paper bells and strings of
tin cans tied to the bumper. And, of course, a ``Just Married''
sign.
   ``Both of us are bus people,'' said Methot, 40, a paper company
employee who lives in Portland. Methot said he and his bride became
close friends a few months after they met while riding the bus to
work together.
   ``There are some very nice people on the bus, but I never
thought I'd meet anyone, and never thought I'd get married, on a
bus,'' said the 41-year-old bride, who works as a salesperson.
``It's one of the craziest things I've done in my life.''
   Metro General Manager Sarah deDoes said she was for the ceremony
from the start. ``Being a romantic myself, when they asked me, I
thought it was just great,'' she said.
   Asked about the couple's honeymoon plans, Methot said, ``It
won't be Greyhound, that's for sure. We're going to Bermuda in the
fall _ they have a good bus system there.''

   Hundreds of people turned out to labor
with shovels and bare hands for their moment of fame _ as builders
of the world's longest sand sculpture.
   After crews worked much of the day under a hot June sun, a
surveying company certified Friday that the sand castle measured
15,063 feet, giving the crew a good shot at getting into the next
Guinness Book of World Records.
   The centerpiece of the project, a 15-foot-high castle with the
logos of corporate sponsors, had been built earlier in the week by
two leading sand sculptors, Todd Vander-Pluym and Mark Altamar.
Then, volunteers made two long, long wings on the building Friday,
following guide lines painted on the beach and taking care to
sculpt the sand and not just pile it up.
   Festival chairman Mary Snipes-Phillips said the surveyors'
findings, along with videotape, photographs, and volunteers'
signatures, will be sent to the Guinness Book of World Records.
   The castle would appear to easily beat the 10,760-foot-long sand
millipede built along South Padre Beach, Texas, in March 1987,
which is listed in the 1989 Guinness book.
   Estimates of the number of folks manning the shovel brigades or
otherwise helping on the project ranged up to 2,000.
   ``It's tough, but I think we'll make it,'' said one volunteer,
Richard Lamb.
   The castle was called ``The Neverending Fantasy'' and included
sculptings of a jet plane, a ``Jungle Lagoon Golf Course,'' a shark
and a castle turret topped with a tiny cocktail umbrella.
   The project was part of the city's six-day Sun Fun Festival
which opened on Friday. By Saturday, much of the castle remained,
but the tide had already begun to wash away parts of it.

   Stefan Szwarnowski, the oldest person to
sail solo across the Atlantic Ocean, is heading out to sea again.
   The 76-year-old Polish native left this New Jersey seashore
community Friday to return home the same way he came, bound for
England aboard the 24-foot Tawny Pipit. He has no radio transmitter
and plans to navigate by sun and stars.
   At least one American friend has tried to talk him out of it and
offered to buy him a plane ticket home.
   ``It (would be) a difficult trip for a 21-year-old man,'' said
Jack Hamann, a marina owner.
   In August, Szwarnowski showed up near Townsends Inlet after a
12-week voyage. His feat will land him in this year's Guinness Book
of World Records as the oldest person to sail alone across the
Atlantic, according to a spokesman for the book.
   During that trip, light winds doubled the time he thought it
would take to make the crossing. His water supply ran low, and he
lost weight.
   Since his arrival, though, he has regained some weight, traveled
by train across the United States and made many friends, despite
his broken English.
   Szwarnowski said he expects to arrive in England in about six
weeks.
   And what if he doesn't arrive at all?
   ``If something happens, you're going,'' he said philosophically.
``If not, you're still going.''

<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>

   On a lava field where Christianity was
proclaimed in Iceland nearly a thousand years ago, Pope John Paul
II appealed Saturday for Christian unity and primacy of moral
values.
   The pope focused on the weakening of family life and
reconciliation among Christians in this country where 2,300 of the
244,000 people are Roman Catholic, and where more people play than
worship on Sundays.
   Iceland was the second stop on the pope's five-nation visit to
Scandinavia, a Lutheran stronghold where the 16th century Protesant
Reformation swept away Catholicism and the current affluent
lifestyle has eroded traditional values of the church.
   He chose an ecumenical service at Thingvellir _ where the
world's oldest parliament was founded in 930 and Christianity was
proclaimed the national religion over paganism in 1000 _ to urge
all Christians to ``heal the wounds of division and re-establish
unity.''
   He spoke in English peppered with a few words of Icelandic to
the congregation of several hundred seated against a backdrop of
spectacular snow-covered mountains:
   ``It is essential to recover an awareness of the primacy of
moral values, to reflect on the ultimate meaning of life and its
transcendent destiny ...
   ``The fact is that families are facing new and serious pressures
which can only be met by a renewed and deeper respect for life and
love.''
   Peter Sigurgeirsson, bishop of Iceland and leader of the
Lutheran church, said he didn't want ``to belittle'' issues
dividing the Christian churches.
   ``But in actual fact, the importance of the things that separate
dwindles when viewed in the light of that which unites. It is the
faith in Christ which unites us,'' he said.
   Some of Iceland's 17 women Lutheran ministers boycotted the
service. The Rev. Hanna Maria Petursdottir said they were
protesting the Catholic Church's refusal to allow women into the
priesthood.
   By Icelandic standards, security was tight for the papal visit.
The communist newspaper Thjodviljinn noted he had six bodyguards
and that the entire Reykjavik police force was mobilized.
   John Paul flew to Iceland from Tromsoe, Norway, where he
extolled marriage and strong family values before fewer than 1,000
people. It was one of the smallest open-air Masses of his 42
foreign trips. Like Icelanders, many people live together in Norway
without getting married.
   Police at Tromsoe detained four people _ two fundamentalist
women protesting ecumenism and two men criticizing the Vatican's
human rights record.
   When the pontiff arrived at Keflavik Airport for the 24-hour
stop in Iceland, Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson welcomed
him ``as a true servant of the God in whom we believe, regardless
of the church to which we may belong.''

   New Prime Minister Sousuke Uno promises to reform
the scandal-tainted government, but he faces the task of fixing a
factious political system that not only helped cause his country's
crisis but also put him in power.
   Soon after Uno was chosen by the governing Liberal Democrats to
replace outgoing Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita as party
president, the former foreign minister promised ``to carry forward
political reforms with all my loyalty and strength.''
   He said the reforms include abolishing the Liberal Democrats'
rival factions, which create formidable power blocs but force
leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers'
political activities.
   That need for money is believed to have led the party leadership
into seeking the quick profits and large donations offered by
companies such as Recruit Co. The publishing conglomerate sold
stock at cut-rate prices to politicians and bureaucrats it hoped to
influence. They made handsome profits after the stock went public,
and the scandal forced Takeshita out of office.
   ``I agree with those who say these are not times to be forever
building factions,'' Uno told reporters Friday. But analysts say
that exorcizing the party of its blocs would be a monumental task
and perhaps an impossible one for Uno, the first president in the
34-year history of the Liberal Democratic Party to have no faction
of his own to fall back on.
   Nearly all legislators from the party are divided into six major
factions _ the largest headed by Takeshita _ that have typically
been allotted power in the party and Cabinet roughly equal to their
number of seats in Parliament. Faction loyalty usually decides how
individual lawmakers will vote on important issues.
   Leading the second- and third-strongest factions are outgoing
party Secretary General Shintaro Abe and former Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, who have both been implicated in the Recruit
scandal.
   Though Uno stressed that he did not ask each faction to submit a
``wish list'' for posts in his Cabinet, an accepted party practice,
the factional balance of power clearly figured in his appointments.
   Joining Uno at the helm of the governing party are Keijiro
Murata, of the Abe faction; Kiyoshi Mizuno, of the Miyazawa
faction; and Ryutaro Hashimoto, of the Takeshita faction.
   The new 21-member Cabinet, including Uno, has six members from
Takeshita's faction, five from Miyazawa's, four each from Abe's and
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's and one each from smaller
factions.
   Uno resigned from the faction that was until Wednesday headed by
Nakasone, whose 1982-87 tenure covered the period when the Recruit
scandal developed. Deeply embroiled in the affair, Nakasone has
given up leadership of his faction, the Liberal Democrats' fourth
largest, and resigned from the party.
   The faction is expected to remain intact under new leadership.
   Concern remains over whether Uno will be independent of
Takeshita and Nakasone, who will retain his seat in the lower house.
   ``He will be a Takeshita puppet, because that is where he will
get his support,'' said political analyst and author Asao
Yamaguchi. Yamaguchi said that without a faction of his own, Uno
has no clear power base and will be forced to rely heavily on those
who do.
   ``There has been no change at all in the basics, or the Liberal
Democrats' attitude,'' Yamaguchi said. ``The (party) is now and
always will be a coalition of factions. They like it that way.''
   To end a rift in 1987, Nakasone handpicked Takeshita as his
successor, and it was widely believed that Takeshita, in turn,
promised to pass the reins on to Abe, his close friend. Abe, too
tainted by Recruit money to replace Takeshita now, reportedly hopes
to succeed Uno when the Recruit dust settles.
   At a news conference on Saturday, Uno denied his government was
only an interim one. ``It is not an interim Cabinet, and I can tell
you that it will be a Cabinet which will be highly appraised,'' he
said.
   The most pressing task for Uno will be to reverse low public
approval ratings for his party before next month's elections for
the upper house of parliament. The Liberal Democrats have
controlled both houses of parliament since 1955, but political
observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a
result of the Recruit scandal.
   Of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cut-rate
stock offered by Recruit, 13 were Liberal Democrats.

<HEAD>Kabul Rocket Attack Kills 5; 100 Reported Killed In Other Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas killed five people
and wounded six in a rocket attack on Kabul on Saturday, and 100
more people were killed in fighting in the cities of Jalalabad and
Kandahar, the government said.
   It urged Prime Ministr Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan to use her
trip to Washington this week to persuade the United States to cut
off arms supplies to the guerrillas and help negotiate an end to
the 11-year-old Afghan war.
   The attack on Kabul started early Saturday, with one rocket
hitting near a kindergarten, then continued through the night in
one of the most intense attacks in more than a month.
   Military observers said the rockets were fired from the
surrounding hills and appeared to be within close range, but they
could not give the distance. The armed forces responded by firing
artillery and machine guns into the hills. The 12 rockets that fell
Saturday raised to 23 the number that have hit Kabul since
Thursday, the Foreign Ministry said. Twelve people were killed and
13 wounded in the earlier attacks, ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi
Amani said.
   He said fighting between the guerrillas and forces of the
Soviet-backed government occurred in the besieged eastern city of
Jalalabad and the southern city of Kandahar and that at least 100
people died and 36 were injured.
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Before Saturday, the insurgents, who are based in Pakistan, had
said an attack on Kabul was imminent. But Amni scoffed at their
claims, saying the fractious resistance was incapable of mounting a
real offensive on the city.
   ``Some time ago, they said they would carry out an extensive
attack on Kabul. But they have been unable to carry this out. A
rocket fired from 25 miles away cannot be considerd an attack,'' he
said.
   The guerrilla's rockets, with a range of 15-35 miles, are
generally fired by remote control from the mountains that ring the
city. They often land in residential areas rather than hitting
military or government intallations.
   Amani said four civilians were killed and six wounded in
Jalalabad, a city 75 miles east of Kabul that has been under a
guerrilla siege March 7. Afghan soldiers killed 72 guerrillas and
injured 21 in an operation to clear the insurgents from the city
and the areas near the airport, Amani said.
   In the southern city of Kandahar, once Afghanistan's
second-largest city, one civlian was killed and two injured by
rockets, he said. Government troops retaliated by attacking rebel
positions 20 miles from the city and killing 23 guerrillas and
wounding seven, he said.
   Elsewhere, five rockets slammed into the southern garrison town
of Khost, Amani said, but there were no casualties.
   Amani urged the Bush administration to reconsider its policy
toward Afghanistan and cut off the flow of weapons to the
guerrillas.
   ``The Afghan government hopes a policy change will be made
during Ms. Bhutto's visit to United States this week,'' he said.
   Ms. Bhutto has called for a political settlement to the Afghan
war but also has said peace talks should not include members of the
ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   President Najib recently has stepped up his call for peace talks
and offered to negtotiate with the opposition and its Western
backers without conditions.
   ``Why does the United States not help restore peace instead of
supplying more arms to the enemy,'' Amani said. ``Is a country that
calls itself an advocate of human rights to act like this? We
consider this irresponsible.''
   The United States has said it will continue to supply weapons to
the guerrillas as long as the Soviet Union continues to aid Najib's
government.

   Police detained 21 people as leftist
demonstrators hurled eggs, tomatoes, stink bombs and paint at about
1,000 supporters of an extreme right party.
   The protest occurred during an election rally of the German
People's Union, whose views often are compared to the Nazis.
   Party candidates for June 18 elections to the European
Parliament are calling for foreigners to be driven out of West
Germany. The party also opposes most European Community policies.
   About 1,000 leftists tried to disrupt the rally and 2,000
police, fearing large-scale clashes, separated the two groups.
Authorities said there were no major incidents.
   In West Berlin, police said they arrested nine neo-Nazi
skinheads after about 150 battled police with bottles and stones
following a soccer match late Friday.
   The skinheads shouted Nazi slogans during the match and later
fought police in a street near the stadium. Police said they
suspect the same group vandalized two subway stations after the
match.

   Nancy Reagan reported Saturday that life after
the White House has its drawbacks.
   ``In the White House, when you needed a plumber, you could
always get one. In private life, you have to wait a little
longer,'' Mrs. Reagan observed, with a rueful smile.
   The former first lady, speaking publicly in Washington for the
first time since she and President Reagan left for California more
than four months ago, offered a few insights into her old and new
lives at a Library of Congress and Random House forum on first
ladies.
   Looking back, Mrs. Reagan told the audience that although the
position of first lady offers a tremendous platform, ``ironically,
in some ways, a first lady loses her freedom of speech.
   ``There were things I longed to say over those eight years,''
Mrs. Reagan said, evoking a laugh from the crowd. ``But I couldn't.
At times it wasn't appropriate, and at other times it would have
further complicated by husband's life.''
   The former actress recalled that in her first stage role, she
played a young woman that had been kidnapped and held in an attic,
with only a chance to utter one line.
   ``There were times (in the White House) when I felt I was in the
attic again,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``It was very frustrating.''
   Mrs. Reagan is wrapping up her memoirs, which will be published
by Random House in the fall. While in Washington, the former first
lady was also scheduled to appear at the American Booksellers
Association to help tout her book.
   Entitled, ``My Turn,'' the former White House resident promised
it would deal with the major controversies of her eight-year
tenure, such as the renovation of the White House, the new ``Nancy
Reagan red'' china, her use of astrology, her battles with chief of
staff Donald Regan and her stormy relationship with Soviet first
lady Raisa Gorbachev.
   Asked if there were any scoops in the volume, she replied with a
smile, ``The title says it all.''
   The first lady said that while there is ``a certain dignity'' to
holding silent, she has turned to writing a book for her own peace
of mind, that of her children, and in order to help set the record
straight.
   ``I felt I could start rebuilding a private life by writing
about some things,'' she said.
   But when asked if she'd ever offer her original, personal
diaries to be donated to her husband's presidential library, a
horrified look crossed Mrs. Reagan's face.
   ``I certainly hope not! I mean, there are some things'' to be
kept private, she responded, as the crowd erupted in chuckles and
applause.

   An Egyptian naval patrol shot and seriously
wounded an Israeli man Saturday when he refused orders to stop his
motorboat in Egyptian waters, Israeli police said.
   Eyptian and Israeli officials gave differing accounts of the
incident.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said Israel asked Egypt
for a ``clarification'' of the incident, which occurred in the Gulf
of Aqaba, near Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat and Egypt's Taba
beach.
   An Egyptian Coast Guard official told the state-run Middle East
New Agency the boat violated Egyptian territory and that Egypt had
protested to Israel. The report said Coast Guard officials fired
warning shots, but it did not mention any casualties.
   Israel's Southern Police District spokesman Shalom Ben Himo said
Shlomo Yisraeli, 42, a resident of Eilat, was fishing in his motor
boat when an Egyptian patrol demanded he stop for identification.
   ``He continued to move,'' Ben Himo said. ``The Egyptians shot a
few warning shots in the air and he was struck by a bullet in the
leg.''
   Israel radio said Yisraeli was on the boat with his two children
and a guest. He refused to stop because he was in Egyptian waters
and his guest did not have a passport, the radio reported.
   It said Yisraeli was shot in the leg and stomach and began
losing large amounts of blood.
   He was treated on the spot by an Egyptian medic. The patrol then
let the boat dock at Taba and Yisraeli was transfered to an Israeli
hospital, where he was in serious condition, the radio reported.
   The Egyptian Coast Guard official said a patrol vessel was
obliged to fire warning shots when an Israeli fishing boat came
within 20 yards of the Egyptian coast and ignored a radio warning
to clear the area.
   He said the Israeli boat fled toward Eilat after getting rid of
some of its catch. The report gave no further details.
   Egyptian patrols have chased away several boatloads of Israelis
who have tried in recent months to visit popular Egyptian fishing
and diving waters without the necessary visas.
   The last major shooting incident between Egyptian troops and
Israelis was in October 1985, when a paramilitary Egyptian police
officer went berserk and killed seven Israeli tourists at the Red
Sea resort of Ras Burka.
   Israel captured the 250-acre resort of Taba, along with the rest
of the Sinai desert, in the 1967 Middle East war. The area is
adjacent to the Israeli town of Eilat.
   Israel returned Taba to Egypt in March after a bitter seven-year
border dispute.

   A sailor who went absent without leave
during the Vietnam War 20 years ago is a ``dinosaur'' from a
different era, and should not be court-martialed, his attorney
argued.
   Charles Smith, who walked away from the Treasure Island base and
his wife and child in 1969, was tracked down by the Navy last month.
   Smith, 40, is charged with desertion and using marijuana. The
drug charge was added because Smith tested positive for marijuana
when he surrendered May 4, Navy officials said.
   If court-martialed and convicted, Smith faces up to seven years
in prison.
   At a Friday hearing to determine whether Smith should be
court-martialed or simply discharged, his attorney, Howard De Nike,
said, ``The man you see before you is sort of ... a dinosaur,
someone from a different era.''
   When Smith went AWOL from the base near here, he was 19, naive
and angry that his wife had been unfaithful, De Nike said.
   Smith remarried, fathered five children and became a respected
foreman at a paint company.
   ``Basically, we don't have the same person today that we had
then,'' De Nike said, arguing that Smith should be granted the same
discharge AWOL servicemen received under amnesty programs during
the 1970s.
   The Navy's prosecutor, Coast Guard Lt. Dennis Hoffman, argued
that Smith's long absence without leave warranted strict punishment
because it was ``aggravating.''
   The presiding officer, Navy Cmdr. David Paul, said he would make
a recommendation within two weeks to Smith's immediate superior at
the base.

   Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early
Sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of
pro-democracy protesters in clashes that witnesses and doctors said
killed at least 32 people. Hundreds were wounded.
   The troops cut a violent swath through the heart of Beijing to
get to the the square, rolling through barricades and surging
masses on the surrounding streets.
   By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen,
boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentrated
around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.
   A half hour later, lights were turned out. The square was in
darkness.
   ``You have to give up all hope,'' students said over their
loudspeaker at the monument. ``You have to give your life to the
movement.''
   Students sang the ``Internationale,'' the communist anthem.
   At 4:30 a.m., armored personnel carriers entered the square and
troops began moving slowly toward several thousand students
clustered around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.
   Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of the
square as troops shot at crowds of thousands. The death and
casualty toll was believed to be mounting rapidly. Ambulances and
bicycle pedicabs went back and forth hauling away the wounded.
   One man was seen shot in the back, another in the head.
   An official loudspeaker on the square announced that the troops
were moving in to clear the area as soldiers prepared to advance
from all four sides.
   Ho Te-chien, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China in 1983
and has been active in the student movement, urged the students to
leave. ``We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much
blood,'' he said over a student loudspeaker.
   A 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, set up by
students last week, remained standing.
   The main streets leading to the Tiananmen, China's symbolic
political center, were sealed. Thousands fled from the square,
where hundreds of thousands of people had gathered to support
students in the third week of a sit-in.
   The assault came two weeks after Premier Li Peng declared
martial law in Beijing and sent troops to the city. Hundreds of
thousands of residents responded by blocking roads with trucks and
their bodies.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Saturday the situation in China had become ``ugly and chaotic.
   ``This will disturb the United States government, and will
disturb the American people, considerably,'' he said. The secretary
hinted that there could be repercussions to the Chinese
government's use of violence.
   The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense but
largely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant or
unable to move against the crowds until the first widespread
violence broke out Saturday afternoon.
   A doctor from the Fuxing Hospital in western Beijing, where
troops began firing on street people, said the hospital had taken
in 15 dead and so many wounded they had to be put in garages.
   A doctor from another hospital said 12 people died there.
   One soldier was killed when he was run over by an armored
personnel carrier rushing toward the square, and another man was
reported shot to death in a street clash elsewhere.
   A Swedish visitor, Tom Hansson, said he saw three people shot to
death in clashes south of the square.
   ``The government is fascist! How can they do this to me? How can
they do this to the people?'' cried a 28-year-old man who was shot
in the leg.
   Most of those shot on the square were hurling rocks at the
troops and people close to their front lines.
   A government loudspeaker on the square charged the students with
``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' and said the military was taking
necessary means to end their rebellion.
   Sporadic clashes and dozens of injuries were reported on
Saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square.
   They retreated momentarily under barrages of rocks, shoes and
other objects, then resumed their most violent push at about 8 p.m.
Saturday, firing weapons and using tear gas and clubs as they moved
toward Tiananmen.
   Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side
of the square, beating people who got in their way. Students threw
Molotov cocktails and other objects at them.
   One armored personnel carrier rammed into a burning bus on
Changan Avenue, the main street running along the square, and was
torched by students. Two people inside were dragged out by the
crowds and beaten severely.
   Other armored personnel carriers drove up and down the avenue
smashing down lane dividers and other barriers set up by citizens
to block the army's way.

   President Bush said Saturday he
deeply deplored the decision by the government of China to use
force ``against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of
life.''
   Bush, spending the weekend at his oceanside home before
returning to Washington after a week-long trip to Europe, issued a
statement which condemned the Chinese tactics.
   ``It is clear that the Chinese government has chosen to use
force against Chinese citizens who were making a peaceful statement
in favor of democracy. I deeply deplore the decision to use force
against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,''
Bush said
   Earlier, Bush had issued no formal reaction to the violence in
Beijing and White House aides had said the administration's
comments would be made by Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Washington. Baker was also sharply critical of the Chinese action.
   But Bush's office later issued a statement in the president's
own words.
   ``We have been urging and continue to urge nonviolence,
restraint and dialogue. Tragically, another course has been chosen.
Again, I urge a return to non-violent means for dealing with the
current situation.''
   The president said the United States and China had built a
``constructive relationship'' during the past 20 years through
``great efforts by both sides.''
   The president added that the relationship had been beneficial to
both nations. ``I hope that China will rapidly return to the path
of political and economic reform and conditions of stability so
that this relationship, so important to both our peoples can
continue its growth.''
   After returning from London on Friday, Bush and his wife Barbara
spent the day at their seaside estate with their daughter Dorothy
and her children, Sam and Ellie.
   Robert Gates, Bush's deputy national security adviser and former
deputy director of the CIA, was at Bush's compound, providing
updates of the developments in Beijing.
   After an early morning jog, Bush spent a quiet day with no
public appearances. He had endured a night of fitful sleep because
of jetlag.
   He arranged a private afternoon meeting with Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell to brief him on the European trip, but
neither planned any remarks afterward.
   The Maine Democrat has criticized Bush as being too cautious and
timid in dealing with initiatives from Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, but that was before the president won widespread praise
for a new U.S. proposal to reduce American and Soviet troops in
Europe.
   European leaders hailed Bush as seizing the initiative from the
Soviet leader.
   At a NATO meeting that concluded last Tuesday, Bush also helped
engineer a compromise to a dispute over East-West negotiations on
short-range nuclear missiles. The agreement stipulates that no
negotiations will be held until the signing of an agreement to
reduce conventional forces and the reductions are already underway.
   Also planning to attend the meeting with Bush were Sen. William
Cohen, R-Maine, and the state's governor, John R. McKernan.
   During his morning jog, Bush was asked whether he had heard from
Gorbachev. ``No phone calls yet,'' he replied.
   Bush, who returned to the United States from a week-long
European trip, awoke at 3 a.m. EDT and finally got up a 4:45 a.m.
Usually he arises between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.
   His dog, Millie, accompanied him on the 20-minute run.
   New England has been hit by its worst mosquito attack in 30
years, and the bugs were out in force during his run. Secret
Service agents and reporters who watched Bush spent much of their
time swatting the bugs. Bush did not appear to be troubled by them.
   After breakfast, the president went fishing for several hours on
his speedboat, ``Fidelity.'' He briefly climbed aboard a Coast
Guard patrol boat and put on a cap they gave him.
   Bush told reporters he also planned to play tennis during the
day.
   The president will return to Washington Sunday evening.

   President Bush appealed Saturday for a return
to the path of reform and nonviolence while the ``ugly and
chaotic'' crackdown on Beijing's pro-democracy demonstrators was
called ``extremely deplorable'' by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Bush issued a late-afternoon statement from his oceanside home
in Kennebunkport, Maine, saying it was ``clear that the Chinese
government has chosen to use force against Chinese citizens who
were making a peaceful statement in favor of democracy.''
   ``I deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful
demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,'' the president said.
   ``We have been urging and continue to urge nonviolence,
restraint and dialogue,'' Bush said. ``Tragically, another course
has been chosen. Again, I urge a return to non-violent means for
dealing with the current situation.''
   He said the United States and China had build a ``constructive
relationship'' over the last two decades through ``great efforts by
both sides.''
   Bush added that closer ties had benefitted both nations. ``I
hope that China will rapidly return to the path of political and
economic reform and conditions of stability so that this
relationship, so important to both our peoples can continue its
growth.''
   Bush, newly returned from a weeklong trip to Europe, initially
issued no formal reaction to the military crackdown on Chinese
student demonstrators. White House aides had said administration
comment would come from Baker.
   In Washington, Baker appeared on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday''
and said that ``excessive force'' should not be used by the Chinese
government.
   His appearance was interrupted by live telephone updates from
reportrs on the scene observing violence in Tiananmen Square.
   As the reporters relayed information that troops had opened fire
on the demonstrators and that ``many people'' had been wounded, the
secretary could hear the sound of ambulances echoing in the
background.
   Baker, responding to the reports, said the United States
believed ``it would be unfortunate indeed if the army of the people
were used to suppress the people.''
   ``It's very important ... that excessive force not be used. That
would unfortunately appear to be the case,'' Baker said.``This will
disturb the United States government, and will disturb the American
people, considerably.''
   The secretary hinted that there could be repercussions to the
Chinese government's use of violence.
   ``It's important that the Chinese people not lose the social and
economic progress, the developments they've made socially and
economically, over the past decade,'' Baker said.
   Asked whether the United States should be sharing military and
scientific technology with a government that shoots its own people,
Baker responded:
   ``Let's see how this most recent and extremely deplorable
development unfolds. Let's see what happens over the course of the
next few days before we start hypothesizing about what we might or
might not do in the future,'' he said.
   However, Sen. Jesse Helms, R.-N.C., said he would ``begin
working with my colleagues to ensure that, as a first response
against this brutality, all U.S. military cooperation and sharing
of technology with the Communist government of China be terminated
immediately.''
   It was the first violence to mar the weeks-long pro-democracy
demonstrations in China.
   Baker, who appeared on the television show at midday, said he
had been in touch with Bush and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing during
the previous hour.
   But the official said he could not confirm the reports of deaths
in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
   ``Unfortunately, the situation in China is turning ugly and
chaotic,'' said Baker.
   Baker noted that shooting has occurred in the square, and that
the embassy had asked its personnel to leave the are.
   ``It is a situation that is not a happy one. ... It is indeed
turning quite ugly,'' Baker said.
   The police contingent guarding the Chinese embassy in Washington
appeared to be a little larger than usual Saturday afternoon, but
there was no sign of activity outside. Chinese students studying in
the United States had demonstrated outside the embassy last month
in support of their colleagues in Beijing.
   The secretary said the United States ``has expressed its concern
to the Chinese government that the utmost restraint be used.''
   He took care to note that the Chinese have exercised ``a
significant amount of restraint'' during the past month that the
demonstrations have gone on.
   Baker added that there have also been reports that ``Molotov
cocktails'' have been used in the most recent outbreak of violence,
and he indicated that restraint also should be observed by the
demonstrators.
   ``Both sides have exercised a significant degree of restraint.
... It is our hope that they will return to restraint,'' Baker said.
   The secretary observed that a ``power struggle'' was going on in
China, but refused to offer any administration evaluation of the
events.
   ``I'd rather not go into any details of who's up and down,''
Baker said.
   He said that while the administration ``had some opinions'' on
it, such comments would be interpreted as interfering in the
internal affairs of another nation.
   Baker said the administration could only wait and ``see how it
develops.''
   ``I don't think we should sit here today, within hours of the
first significant use of force ... against peaceful demonstrations
... and try to hypothesize about what that will mean,'' Baker said.
   ``We will have to see what will happen ... let's see what
happens now as we move forward. We're not sure what course this
will take, even now,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He Most Regrets Letting Bush Bash His State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Saturday his greatest
regret in losing the presidential race was allowing George Bush to
malign Massachusetts, and swore to ``give the Republicans a dose of
their own medicine.''
   Dukakis stopped just short of apologizing to the 4,000 Democrats
gathered for the state party's annual convention. Though he has
been under attack since coming home in defeat to face a mounting
budget deficit, many of the delegates said no apology was needed.
   ``Fiorello LaGuardia, the late, great mayor of New York, used to
say, `When I make a mistake, it's a beaut,' '' Dukakis told the
crowd. ``And I made some beauts in the course of the campaign.
   ``But what I regret most of all is that George Bush didn't only
succeed in painting a distorted picture of Mike Dukakis and what I
stood for. He also managed to put you down in the process,''
Dukakis said.
   ``He put down this great commonwealth and its people,'' he
added. ``And I let him get away with it _ and I shouldn't have.''
   During the presidential race, the Bush campaign attacked
Dukakis' environmental record by drawing attention to the pollution
in Boston Harbor, and sought to discredit the economic
``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   Delegates interrupted the speech repeatedly with applause. Some
waved signs that read ``Proud of Michael Dukakis.''
   Dukakis then lambasted the Republicans with caustic wit that
supporters might have wished he'd inflicted on George Bush.
   ``There's a party whose idea of public safety is Seabrook! ... A
party whose environmental hero is James Watt and whose program for
cleaning up Boston Harbor was one boat ride last fall,'' he said.
   ``They'd probably make Frank Lorenzo secretary of labor,'' he
added, earning a big laugh from labor delegates sporting hats and
pins attacking the besieged Eastern Airlines owner.
   Dukakis has said he will not run for re-election for governor
next year, but hasn't ruled out another bid for the presidency in
1992. He promised to keep Massachusetts Democratic in 1990.
   ``Let's shake off the doubts and the disclaimers,'' he said.
``Let's give the Republicans a dose of their own medicine.''
   Reaction to the speech was divided, with some saying Dukakis
should have offered more than a tepid apology, and others
maintaining an apology would only give ``Duke-bashing'' critics
more ammunition.
   ``I think it was an important apology,'' said U.S. Rep. Chester
Atkins, chairman of the state Democratic Party. Atkins said the
governor's decision to ``own up to the mistakes that have been
made'' was the first step to restoring credibility.
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said while Dukakis acknowledged mistakes
in his campaign, he did not take responsiblity for the deficit that
mushroomed while he was away on the campaign trail.
   ``I think it would have been better to acknowledge error on the
financial situation as well,'' Frank said.
   While Dukakis was at the podium, however, some delegates were
sizing up the floor, where three potential Democratic candidates
for governor were trying to drum up support.
   ``I think the bashing's over,'' said state Rep. Susan Tucker,
D-Andover. ``He's on his way out and people recognize that. The
emphasis is on who's going to replace him.''

   Leftist guerrillas bombed a bus carrying
Government Palace guards through downtown Saturday, killing at
least seven soldiers and police and wounding 24 other people,
authorities said.
   A car blocked the bus while it was en route to the palace,
police said. Two people maneuvered a pushcart loaded with
explosives under the back of the bus then detonated the cargo, they
said.
   The bus was carrying 42 people, mostly soldiers.
   Police said at least six soldiers and a policeman were killed in
the bombing. They said at least 24 were wounded, including soldiers
and bystanders.
   The guards let off a hail of gunfire but the suspects escaped,
police said on condition of anonymity.
   The government of President Alan Garcia, who lives at the
palace, is fighting two leftist guerrilla organizations, the
Mao-inspired Shining Path and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.
   No group claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack.

   Here is a look at key events in the student
pro-democracy movement that led to Sunday's assault by soldiers on
protesters in Tiananmen Square:
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing
University students put up posters praising him and indirectly
criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student
demonstrations in 1986-87.
   April 17 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai,
shouting ``Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!''
   April 27 _ More than 150,000 students, with wide support from
people on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen
Square, chanting slogans for democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Officials meet with student leaders, but independent
student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41
universities.
   April 30 _ Beijing's Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, meets
with student representatives.
   May 4 _ About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen
Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student
movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other
cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   May 9 _ Journalists petition the government for press freedom.
   May 10 _ Thousands of students bicycle to major media offices in
a press freedom demonstration. Another protest is held in the
provincial capital of Taiyuan.
   May 13 _ About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square.
   May 14 _ Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The
number fasting rises to 3,000.
   May 15 _ The government deadline for students to leave the
square passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming
ceremony planned near the square must be moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists
and intellectuals join the protest.
   May 17 _ Zhao pleas for students to leave. Students reject his
appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in
Beijing.
   May 18 _ About 1 million people, including many workers, again
take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers.
Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to
discuss their demands.
   May 19 _ A tearful Zhao visits weakened hunger strikers. Li also
visits the students briefly. The students later decide to end the
hunger strike.
   May 20 _ Martial law is declared in parts of Beijing. Zhao
reportedly resigns after failing to persuade Li and other
hardliners to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then
abandon it, saying they will need their strength for the struggle
ahead.
   May 21 _ Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave
the Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law,
hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block
intersections to prevent troops from reaching it.
   May 22 _ Hundreds of thousands of people again block major roads
and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order
their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is
reported to withdraw.
   May 23 _ One million people take to the streets to demonstrate
for democracy.
   May 25 _ Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial
law. State- run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law,
and military units announce they support martial law.
   May 26 _ Sources say Zhao and another leading liberal, Wan Li,
head of the legislature, are under house arrest.
   May 27 _ Beijing student leaders propose students end their
occupation of Tiananmen Square. Non-Beijing students resist and the
sit-in continues.
   May 28 _ About 80,000 people, many students from outside the
capital, stage a demonstration, but unlike in past rallies few
workers participate.
   May 30 _ Students unveil their ``Goddess of Democracy,'' a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government
calls it an insult to the nation. Students rally outside police
headquarters to protest the detention of three members of an
independent labor union.
   May 31 _ The first of several pro-government rallies is staged
by farmers and workers in Beijing suburbs. The participants,
ordered to show up, show little enthusiasm.
   June 1 _ The Beijing Municipal Government warns foreign
journalists that under martial law they must receive approval for
all press coverage. Coverage of the demonstrations is banned.
   June 2 _ More than 1,000 troops appear outside the railway
station in a show of force.
   June 3-4 _ Tens of thousands of troops make several attempts to
move on the square but are driven back by crowds of hundreds of
thousands of people supporting the students. Riot squads beat and
fire tear gas at demonstrators. A final push is made the evening of
June 3, and soldiers begin firing on crowds. Troops surround and
enter the square June 4 in the early morning hours and thousands of
protesters flee. Hundreds are wounded and many dead.

   Federal prosecutors declined to charge Sen.
Brock Adams, D-Wash., with sexual assault because the young woman
involved acknowledged that she pursued a meeting with him that
night and did not leave after he made sexual advances, according to
a newly released letter.
   The prosecutors also cited a lack of physical evidence or
corroborating testimony for her account.
   In response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The
Associated Press, the U.S. Attorney's office released a copy a
Sept. 1, 1987 letter explaining the outcome to Lawrence Baskir,
attorney for Kari Tupper.
   The letter was signed by Charles H. Roistacher, executive
assistant to then-U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova.
   A former legislative aide and the daughter of longtime Adams
family friends, Ms. Tupper, now 27, said in September of last year
that Adams, now 62, had drugged and fondled her March 27, 1987 in
his Washington, D.C., home while his wife was away.
   Ms. Tupper said she had accepted an invitation to go to a
restaurant with Adams after determining to tell the senator to stop
propositioning her.
   Adams has denied all her allegations but said he made a mistake
letting her spend the night at his house.
   Roistacher wrote Baskir:
   ``She told the police that she has known Senator Adams for many
years as a family friend. She said that Senator Adams made sexual
overtures toward her for several weeks, if not longer.
Nevertheless, she arranged to have dinner alone with him. When he
did not appear, she drove alone to his house, arriving after dark.
   ``There she had several drinks, and by her account, remained in
his house and had another drink even after his conversation became
explicitly sexual. She went to the bathroom and recalls wondering
whether ...(name deleted by the government to protect privacy of
third party) would learn that she had been there. She recalls
little else, except that she awoke the following morning to find
that someone had removed her clothing....Senator Adams, she said,
was lying by her side, fondling her.''
   Roistacher added that she did not report the incident to police
for three days, declined to identify her assailant until June and
gave differing statements to police.
   Of the drugging allegation, Roistacher said, ``No objective
evidence supports your supposition about the drugging except Ms.
Tupper's symptoms the morning after, which seem equally consistent
with excess consumption of alcohol over the course of an evening.''
A hospital test the day after showed no evidence of drugging.
   Although Baskir had claimed her account was corroborated,
Roistacher replied, ``This `abundant' evidence does not consist of
eyewitness testimony about the crime, nor of physical, scientific
or medical evidence, but the subsequent repetition of her story to
close friends and relatives.''

   President Bush said Saturday he
deeply deplored the military crackdown in China that resulted in
the deaths of peaceful demonstrators and he urged Beijing's
government to return to non-violent tactics in dealing with
pro-democracy protestors.
   ``We have been urging and continue to urge non-violence,
restraint,'' Bush said. ``Tragically another course has been
chosen.''
   ``Again, I urge a return to non-violent means for dealing with
the current situation,'' the president said. Bush made his remarks
in a written statement issued from his vacation home here.
   Bush, who arrived here Friday from a week-long European trip,
did not make any public appearance but was kept abreast of
developments in China by Robert Gates, his deputy national security
adviser.
   He also consulted by telephone with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Washington.
   ``It is clear that the Chinese government has chosen to use
force against Chinese citizens who were making a peaceful statement
in favor of democracy. I deeply deplore the decision to use force
against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life,''
Bush said.
   The president said the United States and China had built a
``constructive relationship'' during the past 20 years through
``great efforts by both sides.''
   The president added that the relationship had been beneficial to
both nations. ``I hope that China will rapidly return to the path
of political and economic reform and conditions of stability so
that this relationship, so important to both our peoples can
continue its growth.''
   After returning from London on Friday, Bush and his wife Barbara
spent the day at their seaside estate with their daughter Dorothy
and her children, Sam and Ellie.
   After an early morning jog, Bush spent a quiet day with no
public appearances. He had endured a night of fitful sleep because
of jetlag.
   Bush met at his seaside home with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine. They were
accompainied by Maine Gov. John McKernan and his wife, Rep. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine.
   Stopping by a cluster of reporters at a checkpoint near Bush's
compound, the two senators praised Bush's statement on China,
saying they supported him.
   Asked if there was anything more the United States could do,
Cohen said ``I think `deplore' and coming from the president is
pretty strong language.''
   Mitchell said, ``I do believe that there can be no justification
for the actions by the Chinese government and the use of force
against its own citizens peacefully demonstrating for the most
basic freedoms and I support _ I strongly support _ the president's
deploring of that violence.''
   ``We ought to make it very clear the U.S. government stands
with, and in support of, those who seek freedom and democracy in
China and throughout the world,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell, who had criticized Bush in recent weeks for moving too
slowly in responding to initiatives from Moscow, also praised the
Bush's NATO proposal to cut American and Soviet combat troops in
Europe. Asked if he regretted his earlier criticism, Mitchell said
there was nothing to regret.
   ``We're pleased he took our advice and is now moving fast,''
Mitchell said.
   European leaders hailed Bush as seizing the initiative from
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At a NATO meeting that concluded last Tuesday, Bush also helped
engineer a compromise to a dispute over East-West negotiations on
short-range nuclear missiles. The agreement stipulates that no
negotiations will be held until the signing of an agreement to
reduce conventional forces and the reductions are already underway.
   During his morning jog, Bush was asked whether he had heard from
Gorbachev. ``No phone calls yet,'' he replied.
   Bush, who returned to the United States from a week-long
European trip, awoke at 3 a.m. EDT and finally got up a 4:45 a.m.
Usually he arises between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.
   His dog, Millie, accompanied him on the 20-minute run.
   New England has been hit by its worst mosquito attack in 30
years, and the bugs were out in force during his run. Secret
Service agents and reporters who watched Bush spent much of their
time swatting the bugs. Bush did not appear to be troubled by them.
   After breakfast, the president went fishing for several hours on
his speedboat, ``Fidelity.'' He briefly climbed aboard a Coast
Guard patrol boat and put on a cap they gave him.
   Bush told reporters he also planned to play tennis during the
day.

<HEAD>Jurors Must Decide What Congressman Knew About Money Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For jurors in the two-week-old perjury trial of
former Republican Rep. Pat Swindall, a familiar question is taking
shape: What did he know, and when did he know it?
   At issue is what Swindall knew about money broker ``Mike
Martinez'' _ actually undercover Internal Revenue Service Agent
Michael Mullaney _ and where Martinez claimed he got his money.
Swindall negotiated with the agent for $850,000 for home
construction over one month in 1987.
   Swindall is accused in the 10-count indictment of lying to a
federal grand jury in February 1988. Under the cloud of the
indictment, he lost his bid for a third term to Democrat Ben Jones,
onetime star of the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' television show, last
November in a district in Atlanta's suburbs.
   If convicted, he faces 10 months to five years in prison on each
count.
   The jury in the case has heard audio tapes and seen videotapes
in which Swindall, at various times, acknowledged that drugs were
the likely source of the money ``Martinez'' had.
   In those conversations, Mullaney also told Swindall that the
deal involved ``washing'' of cash, and the congressman proposed
receiving the money through a mortgage company created for the
purpose by Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, a Cuban emigre who
has since been convicted of money laundering.
   The tapes are the backbone of the government's case, as
prosecutors try to prove that Swindall lied when he testified he
did not recall discussing the illegal nature of the money handling
and that he didn't recall being told the money was narcotics money,
among other allegations.
   Swindall's lead attorney, Richard Hendrix, says he will prove
that LeChasney was ``psychotic liar'' who deceived Swindall into
thinking the deal for $850,000 from Mullaney was all right, while
deceiving the agent into thinking Swindall was a crook.
   In cross-examination over three days last week, Hendrix hammered
at Mullaney over statements the agent himself made in the tapes.
Mullaney told Swindall at one point the money was ``flight
capital,'' then said at another point that it was not and ``could
be anything.''
   Flight capital is money sent out of troubled areas by wealthy
people seeking to invest or store it in a stable country like the
United States.
   And more than two dozen times, Hendrix forced Mullaney to
concede that he did not know what kind of tale LeChasney was
telling Swindall.
   Mullaney, the government's first witness in the case, was on the
stand more than six days, going one-by-one over tapes of 16
conversations he had with LeChasney about the Swindall deal, plus
five with the congressman himself and two meetings with both men.
   Tapes the jury saw or heard include one of a meeting between the
three on Sept. 13, 1987, at a posh West Virginia resort,
``Martinez'' told Swindall ``clearly, I violate some currency
laws,'' and ``my gut feeling is there has to be narcotics dollars
in there. ... It is not flight capital.''
   ``Anything you tell me is told in total confidence,'' Swindall
replied.
   Later, Swindall said, ``I am basically using Charles as my
buffer. ... What I have to say is, I borrowed money from
Gulfstates,'' LeChasney's company.
   On Sept. 23, Swindall indicated he knew LeChasney would handle
the cash in circumvention of bank reporting laws.
   ``Charles is going to ensure that basically the money is
funneled in a way so that there are no reports filed,'' Mullaney
said.
   ``Yeah. I'm protected that way,'' Swindall replied.
   Finally, as the deal collapsed on Sept. 26, Swindall told the
agent he would ``acknowledge'' an ``assignment'' of assets through
LeChasney to Martinez, but he could not accept the cash directly,
because ``I would then be laundering y'all's money.''
   But Hendrix, in cross-examination, repeatedly asked Mullaney why
he had misled the congressman when he told him flatly the money
``is flight capital.''
   ``As opposed to being laundered out of some drug scheme,''
Swindall said.
   ``I would assume so,'' the agent replied.
   Mullaney testified that he was portraying a drug-money
launderer, and such a person would fudge details of the deal when
talking on the telephone.

   Thousands of smiling, flag-waving Poles gathered
at their nation's consulates in the United States on Saturday to
vote in the freest elections behind the Iron Curtain in 42 years.
   ``For the first time, we're voting with pleasure,'' Ada Cichy
said as she stood in the entry hall of the consulate here.
   Polish diplomatic and contract workers and immigrants who remain
Polish citizens also flocked to consulates in New York and
Washington to vote a day in advance of Sunday's elections in Poland.
   The elections are the result of an agreement between the
communist government and the Solidarity trade union, in which
Solidarity was given legal status after a seven-year ban.
   Ballots from about 600,000 Poles abroad will be counted in a
single district in the middle of Warsaw, which has only 140,000
eligible voters.
   ``Ninety percent of the people are going to vote for
Solidarity,'' Cichy said in Chicago. ``The party doesn't stand a
chance.''
   The U.S. results are not expected to be known until Sunday
morning at the earliest.
   Hundreds of people here greeted each other in Polish on Saturday
as they waited in long lines under gray skies and frequent heavy
rains. A nearby bus shelter was plastered with posters for
Solidarity candidates.
   ``These are our history's first really democratic elections,''
said Vice Consul Robert Michniewicz. ``The voters are excited and
really happy. I've seen a lot of smiles on their faces.''
   About 4,000 people had turned out by early evening, a sharp
contrast to previous elections that typically drew only about 200
people, Michniewicz said.
   Balloting was slowed by the small number of poll workers and a
shortage of voting booths. Crowds of people sat in stairways and
around coffee tables to mark paper ballots.
   In New York, hundreds of people crowded into the ornate
consulate on Madison Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
   ``This is pure satisfaction,'' said Jack Piotrowski of Butler,
N.J. who emigrated from Poland six years ago. ``If it was the old
kind of voting, I wouldn't be here.''
   By early evening, 5,000 people had voted, said Mieczyslaw
Gorajewski, an official poll watcher there.
   Busloads of people arrived from Connecticut, New Jersey and
Massachusetts, and hundreds came by subway. A group of about 50
from Boston marched up a Madison Avenue with a Solidarity flag.
   ``It is amazing _ a Polish miracle,'' said Tomasz Zalewski of
Brooklyn, an official poll watcher for Solidarity.
   In Washington, where few Poles live, about 175 people had turned
up by noon, said an embassy official who declined to give his name.
   Not everybody supported the balloting. Outside the Chicago
consulate, Jozef Losiak handed out pamphlets urging a boycott.
   ``These are not truly democratic elections,'' Losiak said. ``For
the first time, the Communist government is going to have a moral
legitimacy in the eyes of the people. We only want 100 percent free
elections.''
   Under the pact between the opposition and the government, 65
percent of the seats in Poland's 460-member lower house, or Sejm,
are reserved for the Communist Party and its allies. Balloting for
the new Senate is wide open.
   Others in the United States urged fellow Poles to vote. Wojtek
Sawa, the host of a Polish-language radio program in Chicago,
handed out lists of the names of Solidarity-backed candidates. Sawa
called a boycott ``ridiculous.''
   ``For the first time in 45 years, the people have a chance to
gain some ground,'' he said. ``By not taking advantage of that, we
wouldn't gain anything.''

   ``Ed's Party,'' planned as a step
toward getting on with life, brought some unwelcome notoriety
Saturday to the town where Pan Am Flight 103 crashed.
   ``Let's party!'' said Ed Blaus, 14, of Sicklerville, N.J., for
whom the event was named.
   To some relatives of the 270 people killed by the terrorist bomb
that felled the Boeing 747 on Dec. 21, a party seemed
inappropriate, especially because of Pan Am's involvement.
   London's Daily Telegraph called it ``a bizarre attempt to make
up for the airliner disaster,'' leaving the town's leaders
defensive Saturday.
   ``Given the circumstances of this town, the party is unusual,
but it is being supported by the vast majority of the local people,
not to cause distress or anguish but to prove to themselves and the
world that whereas we mourn those who died, they are determined to
repair their town, rebuild shattered lives and ensure a special and
sacred place in their hearts for 270 people from 24 nations,'' said
Alex McElroy, chairman the local Community Support agency.
   Response was enthusiastic, with families and groups of children
heading toward the football ground as early as 9 a.m. for a day of
hamburgers, hot dogs, bagpipes and rock bands in the sun. All wore
red ``Ed's Party'' badges to distinguish townspeople from reporters.
   ``This is their town and their party,'' McElroy told a news
conference.
   Pan Am was not represented.
   Ed Blaus said he had written asking the airline to send
Christmas presents to the children of Lockerbie.
   The first he heard of a party, he said, was when Pan Am invited
him, his parents and three brothers.
   Moses Kungu, a Lockerbie pharmacist and regional councilor, said
Pan Am raised the idea of a summer Christmas, but townspeople
suggested the party instead.
   ``The idea is not Pan Am's. It is from the community,'' Kungu
said.
   Joe Horgan of West Point, Pa., a member of the Victims of Pan Am
103 group, was quoted by The Dumfries and Galloway Standard as
saying, ``It is good for them to have a party, but Pan Am's
involvement is despicable. We see this purely as a public relations
exercise on their part.''
   About 20 relatives and friends of victims gathered outside Pan
Am's New York headquarters Saturday to protest the airline's role
in the party.
   ``I'm outraged,'' said a tearful Florence Bissett, whose
21-year-old son, Kenneth, was killed in the bombing. ``How can they
do something like that _ picnic where bodies were found?''
   Susan Cohen of Port Jervis, N.Y., said: ``We feel Pan Am should
be putting its money into security, not parties.''
   Scottish police say they believe the plane was blown apart by a
bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player in the hold.
   Complaints from relatives led the Disney Organization to cancel
plans to send Mickey Mouse to the party, and the Hebrew National
company decided against supplying hot dogs.
   ``The party doesn't mean that we are going to forget what
happened on Dec. 21, but everyone must remember that (it) is
primarily for the children,'' said Elma Brockbank of Lockerbie.
   ``There is a feeling that perhaps the Americans haven't thought
enough about our children _ after all, they were looking forward to
meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse,'' she said.
   Kungu said children between 8 and 14 were affected most by the
tragedy, especially in the Rosebank neighborhood where the plane's
engines jammed into the ground.
   ``Bodies were scattered all over the place. Children have seen
that,'' he said.
   Among special guests was Syracuse University football coach Dick
McPherson, invited because several Syracuse University students
died in the bombing.
   ``Why am I here? People are telling me that we can help,'' said
McPherson, who brought helmets and other American football
equipment to show the children.
   ``If they ask you to do something, if you don't you're damned,
and if you do perhaps you're damned as well,'' he said.
   Alan Nicol, who brought his two children, said the party was ``a
day for the children to remember and a day when everyone has got
together on a happy occasion, when we can begin to put the past
behind us.''

<HEAD>Swiss Socialists: No Farewell to Arms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Swiss Socialist Party decided Saturday not to
back a movement to dismantle the country's army, averting a crisis
for the 30-year coalition government.
   After intense debate at a Socialist congress in Bern, delegates
voted 583 to 370 against taking any stand on a Nov. 26 national
referendum on the proposal to disband Switzerland's 625,000-member
army.
   Socialist Party President Helmut Hubacher had called the
proposal ``a rotten egg'' and urged the party to take a clear stand
against it.
   The proposal has drawn a fierce reaction from the Socialists'
three center-right partners in a governing alliance which is cited
as a prime factor in Switzerland's political stability.
   A leader of the conservative Swiss People's Party, Christoph
Blocher, had said an anti-army decision by the Socialists should
spell the end of the government coalition.
   After the vote, however, Blocher said the Socialists should
remain in the alliance.
   The strongest reaction to the vote came from the Free Radical
Democrats, Switzerland's largest party, which called for talks
between the four parties on the Socialists' role in the government.
Its official statement said the vote called into question the
Socialists' commitment to Switzerland's ``armed neutrality.''
   The third partner, the Christian Democrats, also criticized the
Socialists. They said the Socialists had lost credibility in
deciding to take no stand.
   Saturday's special congress revealed deep divisions among the
Socialists themselves. Right-wing members and trade union leaders
oppose the disarmament plan, while young party members are
particularly important in a pacifist groundswell.
   Even though delegates at the congress in the Swiss capital
decided by a majority of 213 against making a recommendation on
referendum, a surprising majority of 641 to 259 said they
personally backed the no-army proposal.
   The anti-army proposal was put forward by socialists and
religious pacifists who collected 113,000 signatures, forcing the
referendum. The proposed amendment to the federal constitution says
``Switzerland has no army'' and deletes all references to defense
needs.
   Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one in four Swiss
voters might sympathize with the ``zero option.''
   Protests have grown against low-flying combat planes and noise
from militia target practice at the country's shooting ranges.
   But most Swiss seem to oppose a farewell to arms in this country
where the military has a long tradition, even though the army has
not fought a foreign war for five centuries.

   A car believed to have plunged into the Great
Miami River when a temporary bridge collapsed was pulled from the
river Saturday with a body inside.
   The body was the second found in the river since the May 26
collapse of the one-lane, temporary U.S. 52 bridge. The body of
Helen C. Zorn, 52, of the Cincinnati suburb of Green Township, was
found floating in debris Tuesday about five miles downriver from
the bridge.
   Hamilton County authorities said this week that Mrs. Zorn's
daughter, Terry Siemon, 27, was believed to have been with Mrs.
Zorn when the bridge collapsed.
   Sheriff's officers, however, could not immediately confirm that
the body recovered Saturday was that of Ms. Siemon, even though the
car was identified as the one occupied by the mother and daughter,
said sheriff's spokesman Frank Weikel.
   The body was taken to the Hamilton County coroner's office in
Cincinnati for identification, Weikel said.
   Professional divers working with a crane operator about 75 yards
down river from the collapsed bridge located the submerged car. The
crane then dragged it out of the water.
   Later in the day, heavy rain began falling on the site 12 miles
west of Cincinnati, and the search for more victims was called off
for several days until the river level drops back down, Weikel said.
   Strong underwater currents during the past week have frustrated
recovery efforts, which prompted Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. to hire
divers who have experience in underwater investigation at accident
sites.
   Searchers using a sonar imaging device have been unable to find
a second vehicle, either a van or pickup truck, that two witnesses
reported seeing fall from the bridge.
   ``There are no missing-person reports that came in on the van
that supposedly went down, so we're beginning to think there was no
van,'' Weikel said.

   The big guns in electronic fun tried to stake
claims on young hearts Saturday, displaying such gadgets as
portable, hand-held video games and a microphone that lets you
sound like Darth Vader or Mickey Mouse.
   The collection of goodies was at the four-day Consumer
Electronics Show, which runs here through Tuesday.
   The toys aren't just for kids. A number of electronics
manufacturers are marketing telephones that look like bowling pins,
hamburgers and fish _ with your choice of large-mouth bass, chinook
salmon or walleye pike.
   For car buffs, Panasonic representatives are showing systems
that project a map on the windshield to keep drivers eyes on the
road. They also display camera-relayed rear and side vision on a
screen in the dashboard.
   ``You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to
change a tire,'' said Pat Griffis, a spokesman for Panasonic.
   A microphone changes voice patterns to any of 16 octaves _
making it easy to mimic film characters including the deep-voiced
Darth Vader or a squeaky Mickey Mouse. The device was developed by
Ohio Art Co., creators of Etch A Sketch, and should be in retail
stores by the Christmas season with a $48 price tag.
   John Weisman, president of Chicago-based ESP Corp., hopes to
cash in on what he calls the ``world's first computer sport.'' The
game, called Battletech Center, is a mix of Disney-like
environmental fantasy and flight simulator technology, he said.
   Players sit in four cockpits, and must act as a team in a
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles.
   ``The desire to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Luke Skywalker in
Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think
that's a very common fantasy,'' Weisman said. ``I wanted to create
something that kids think about and use some strategy instead of
just their trigger finger.''
   It took him eight years to develop the game, and he is
negotiating for lease space to open a Battletech Center in Chicago
by the end of the year. Players would pay $6 for a half-hour game.
   ``It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said Brian Bayley as he
stepped out of the cockpit along with colleague Gary Bleckert. The
two show attendees from a St. Louis company, Gusdorf Corp.,
predicted the game would ``definitely catch on.''
   Only retailers, buyers, manufacturers and media representatives
are allowed in the annual show at McCormick Place.
   Among the new items offered by video game giants Nintendo and
Atari are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have
more advanced television-like screens. Nintendo's Game Boy, which
has liquid crystal display, will retail for Christmas at $89.95.
The Atari Advantage, which has a color screen, will sell for $140.
   Nintendo is also offering new for 1989 a Soviet-developed game
called Tetris, which asks a player to build a horizontal line with
a series of uneven lines and shapes.
   The company is spending about $4 million to market the game to
an older crowd, ``from 2 to 92,'' said Bill White, Nintendo
advertising manager.

   Powerful thunderstorms spawned tornadoes, winds up to 60 mph,
hail and heavy rain in the nation's midsection Saturday, damaging
homes and flooding streets.
   Thunderstorms or showers fell in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.
   In Indiana, a tornado near Delong overturned several house
trailers, slightly injuring three people, and downed trees and
power lines, the Fulton County Sheriff's Department said.
   Another twister touched down briefly in Mishawaka, damaging four
trailers, collapsing a vacant municipal storage building and
downing several power poles, officials said. There were no
injuries, but damage was estimated at $500,000.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell and winds gusted to 60 mph.
   Two tornadoes were reported in Henry County, Ohio, and two to
three twisters touched down in Tulia, Hale and Anahuac, Texas.
There were no reports of heavy damage or injuries.
   In Michigan, thunderstorms generated winds gusting to 60 mph
that downed power lines and several trees in Monroe. Two inches of
rain fell in less than 30 minutes in Brownstown Township, flooding
streets.
   A flash flood watch was in effect for a large section of west
Texas.
   On Friday night, thunderstorm winds clocked at nearly 60 mph in
Lincoln, Neb., blew over a 126{-foot section of a replica of the
Vietnam War memorial in Washington, D.C., said Toney Redman. The
replica, called the Moving Wall, and some metal supports were
damaged.
   Driving rain and high winds in Eagle, Neb., forced the
cancellation of a rock concert by the Beach Boys and Chicago.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell Saturday in southern
Florida. Cloudy skies and scattered showers stretched from the
central High Plains to Nevada.
   Heavier rainfall during six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly 2 inches at Fort Wayne, Ind., and 1\ inches at Fort Smith,
Ark.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 98 degrees in Alice,
Cotulla and Laredo, Texas, and in Savannah, Ga.
   The low for the 48 contiguous states was 33 degrees in Craig,
Colo., and Flagstaff, Ariz.
   The forecast for Sunday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the northern Rockies and Nevada to the Great
Plains and the Atlantic Coast, with showers and thunderstorms most
likely along a cold front from eastern Idaho and southern Montana
to the central Great Plains and the upper Ohio Valley, and over
Maine. Sunny skies were expected over the Great Lakes region, the
upper Mississippi Valley, the Southwest and the Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s from the northern
Rockies and northern Nevada to the northern and central Rockies, in
the upper Great Lakes and northern Maine; in the 90s in Southern
California, southern Arizona and southern Texas and from Florida to
southeastern Virginia; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere in the
nation.

   Combining pep rally spirit and a serious
message, a global telecast aimed at more than 1 billion people
brought celebrities and world leaders together Saturday to push for
a new age of environmental consciousness.
   Called ``Our Common Future,'' the five-hour telecast originated
from New York and picked up satellite feeds from London, Moscow,
Australia, Brazil, Tokyo, Poland and elsewhere.
   Organizers said it was beamed to 100 countries, making it
potentially available to 90 percent of the world's television sets.
   Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was host of the
collage of music and messages calling for the world to adopt
``sustainable development,'' to reach a happy medium between
improving living standards and protecting resources and the
environment for the future. Mrs. Brundtland chaired a United
Nations commission that developed a report, also called ``Our
Common Future,'' on the same topic.
   ``We need more people to be aware,'' Mrs. Brundtland said as she
opened the broadcast.
   In London, rock musician Bob Geldof quoted Albert Einstein as he
urged viewers to adopt the program's message.
   ``Everything has changed but the way we think,'' Geldof said.
``The first thing we have to change is the way we think.''
   Organizers say the spectacle was not a fund-raiser but a
consciousness-raiser, designed to take advantage of growing concern
over ozone depletion, global warming, tropical rain forest
destruction and other issues.
   ``It's a kind of wake-up call,'' said singer John Denver, one of
the participants.
   Among the other musicians to perform were Stevie Wonder, Elton
John, Sting, Diana Ross, Bob Geldof and Herbie Hancock. Film stars
Richard Gere, Christopher Reeve and Sigourney Weaver and former
Brazilian soccer great Pele also appeared.
   In taped messages, U.S. President George Bush and other world
leaders called for a coordinated international approach to
environmental problems.
   ``We have the talents and resources to advance civilization,''
Bush said. ``Our scientists are probing the mysteries of the
universe. Surely we can apply that same creativity, the same
industry and perseverance, to protect the environment of the one
Earth we all share. We just need the will to do it.''
   In a last-minute arrangement, the show included a live feed from
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's address Saturday to the lower
chamber of the new Supreme Soviet legislature. Gorbachev spoke of
improving efficiency in the use of money and resources ``for
ecological purity.''
   Chinese Premier Li Peng also made a pre-taped statement, calling
for a collective international effort to solve global warming and
other problems. The statement was made before Sunday's deadly
clashes in Tiananmen Square, in which Chinese troops ousted
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Other leaders whose taped comments were broadcast included U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert Mugabe.

Aid benefit for African relief in 1985, teamed up again for the
telecast. The Swiss-based Centre for Our Common Future and
Washington-based Uplinger Enterprises put it together.
   ``To hold this kind of event lays the foundation of public
awareness,'' said Warren H. Lindner, executive director of the
center. ``You know and I know that political change comes not in
and of itself but is greatly facilitated by an informed and
motivated public.''
   The budget was just under $2 million, which is being covered by
corporate sponsors, Lindner said. All the entertainers donated
their talents, as did many other professionals and technicians
involved.
   Setting up the satellite links and other organizational tasks
were similar to the Live Aid program, which was held in two outdoor
sports stadiums in the United States and Britain, he said.
   The difference is in the participants. Live Aid was virtually
all music and had Irish rock musician Geldof as its host.
   ``It's been a very, very difficult situation,'' Uplinger said.
``You have heads of state involved. You can't do the same things
with Mrs. Brundtland as you can do with Bob Geldof.''
   Mrs. Brundtland chaired a U.N.-appointed commission that spent
three years gathering testimony and information to compile a report
on the world's environment and development. The report was also
called ``Our Common Future.''
   She received the 1988 Third World Prize from the London-based
Third World Foundation for her work of the commission.

<HEAD>Koop Calls for `Profound Change' in American Health Care System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retiring Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said
Saturday the U.S. health care system is unfair to millions of
Americans, and he called for the appointment of a presidential
commission to draft a plan for change.
   In a commencement address to 2,200 graduates of the University
of Massachusetts at Boston, Koop catalogued the ills of the medical
delivery and insurance system, laying particular emphasis on
inequities.
   ``Our current system of health care is not fair, it's not just,
and it's not the morally strong system this country deserves,'' he
said.
   The 72-year-old Koop, who is retiring this year after eight
years as surgeon general, cited estimates that 37 million Americans
_ about 15 percent of the population _ have no health insurance,
while millions of others have only partial coverage.
   He said health care costs have been rising at two to three times
the rate of inflation as a whole, and public expectations of
medical care are ``fast outracing our ability to pay for them.''
   The former pediatric surgeon also was critical of both doctors
and hospitals, saying he did not foresee ``the medical profession
achieving any success in self-regulation.'' He noted that many
hospitals have tried to cut the number of indigent patients they
treat.
   ``I say there's something terribly wrong with a system of health
care that spends more and more money to serve fewer and fewer
people,'' he said.
   Koop provided no specific recommendations for reform, however,
beyond suggesting the appointment of a presidential commission.
   He did not call for national health insurance, even though he
was introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a strong
supporter of that concept.
   He also steered clear of the term socialized medicine, saying he
favored a ``laissez-faire marketplace and a competitive economy.''
One of the problems of the current health care system, he said, is
that it is ``distinguished by a lack of competition in price,
quality or service.''
   ``We need a presidential commission, the bluest of blue-ribbon
panels, to consider the future of health care in America,'' he said.
   Koop suggested that the panel include health care professionals,
insurance industry representatives and members of Congress.
   While the creation of a more equitable health care system will
be ``a major task for America,'' Koop said, it is something ``we
need to prove to ourselves and the world'' if the nation is to
retain its moral strength.

   More than 4,000 anti-nuclear activists
Saturday staged the biggest rally against the Seabrook nuclear
plant in 11 years, a prelude to a civil disobedience protest
planned for Sunday.
   Traffic lined a highway that runs by the seaside plant, and many
of the cars sported anti-Seabrook signs. At Hampton Beach State
Park, less than two miles from the plant, protesters heard speakers
denounce Seabrook and promise to continue fighting to prevent it
from operating commercially.
   Seabrook opponent Steve Comley drew cheers when he told the
gathering he had hired planes pulling anti-nuclear banners to fly
over the beach Saturday and about 40 miles up the Maine coast to
President Bush's home at Kennebunkport, Maine, on Sunday. Bush was
spending the weekend there.
   ``The nuclear industry and some of the people in Washington
believe this fight is over,'' Comley said. ``I'll tell you, we're
just starting.''
   The anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance is organizing the protests,
which it hopes will be the biggest since May 1977, when 1,414
people were arrested at the Seabrook site. About 2,500 arrests have
been made in protests at the plant since construction began in 1976.
   Saturday's rally had the largest turnout since a 1978 protest
that drew an estimated 18,000 people.
   Officials in neighboring Massachusetts also have sought to block
the plant by refusing to cooperate with emergency evacuation
planning. Despite the opposition, Seabrook won its low-power
testing license from federal regulators on May 26, nearly three
years after the $6 billion reactor was completed.
   Plant officials have begun preparing for the first atomic chain
reaction by Tuesday or Wednesday, plant spokesman Ron Sher said.
   Sher, who stopped by the rally, said the protesters represented
a ``vocal minority.''
   ``But the majority of people in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and
the rest of New England recognize that nuclear power is a viable
energy alternative and Seabrook ... is ready to produce electricity
and it can make an important contribution,'' Sher said.
   The plant first must win federal approval for evacuation plans
for crowded summer beaches and communities up to 10 miles away.
   ``The truth is you cannot evacuate Hampton Beach and the other
beaches and protect the people,'' attorney Robert Backus, who has
represented anti-Seabrook groups since 1972, told the crowd.
   ``The truth is we don't know what to do with nuclear waste,''
Backus said. ``The truth is that the plant is uneconomic.''
   Before the weekend, at least 300 to 500 people went through
training sessions on non-violent civil disobedience, Clamshell
spokesman Paul Gunter said. The sessions continued Saturday.
   On Sunday, some activists planned to climb fences surrounding
the 715-acre plant site and others planned to sit down outside
gates. Some protesters also planned to go to a railroad siding at
the plant to re-create an August 1976 protest in which 18 people
were arrested _ the first group civil disobedience against a U.S.
nuclear power plant.
   Earlier in the week, Superior Court Judge Vincent Dunn let the
town charge the organizers a $300 fee and $3,600 bond for an
assembly permit. Clamshell members said they couldn't and wouldn't
pay.
   Since a town ordinance bars gatherings of more than 25 people
without a permit, the activists said they planned to march to the
plant on Sunday in groups of fewer than 20.

   Tens of thousands of Israelis, some carrying
signs saying ``Thou shalt not kill!'' on Saturday protested attacks
by Jewish settlers on Arab communities in the occupied territories.
   Also Saturday, Israeli troops wounded 13 Palestinians in clashes
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials
said.
   In Tel Aviv's Kings of Israel Square, about 30,000 supporters of
a leftist peace coalition held the protest rally against violence
by Jewish settlers.
   Israel television said rally organizers were distributing
petitions, already signed by 32 of Parliament's 120 members,
calling on police and the army to arrest settler vigilantes.
   ``If Israel does not get up and stop them now, maybe some day
not far from now, they (the settlers) will arrest us,'' said
Israeli author Amos Oz.
   The Israeli news media said Saturday the army is considering
restricting the movement of settlers suspected of involvement in
vigilante acts against Palestinians.
   About 70,000 Jews live in 131 settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip that have an Arab population of 1.7 million.
   In the Gaza Strip Israeli soldiers shot and wounded eight
Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy who was hit in the leg,
Arab hospital officials reported.
   They said that in the West Bank troopers shot and wounded five
Palestinians and one of the victims was a 7-year-old boy.
   The army announced an indefinite curfew on Gaza beginning Sunday
morning, restricting the seaside strip's 700,000 residents to their
homes.
   Palestinian militants launched an uprising against Israeli
occupation in December 1987 and since then at least 504 Arabs have
been killed in the violence. Twenty-two Israelis have been killed.

<HEAD>Americans Think Ethics Craze Is Paralyzing Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many Americans think the current focus on ethics
is paralyzing the U.S. government, but about half said Speaker Jim
Wright was treated fairly by the House of Representatives,
according to a poll released Saturday.
   Fifty-four percent of the people interviewed said the attention
to ethics was preventing the government from focusing on the budget
deficit, education, crime, drugs and the homeless, according to the
poll, which will be published in this week's Newsweek magazine.
   But 41 percent said it was necessary to restore integrity and
confidence in government.
   On the controversial issue of congressional pay raises, 56
percent of Americans oppose any pay increase, the poll found.
   Fifteen percent said Congress should get a raise and 26 percent
said members should get a raise only if they give up speaking fees,
the poll said.
   Asked to describe Congress' greatest problem, 53 percent said
members were not dealing with the nation's real problems; 20
percent said they were too tied to special interests through
campaign contributions; and 18 percent pointed to the sexual
misconduct, excessive drinking and unethical financial dealings of
members.
   Forty-nine percent said the House gave fair treatment to Wright,
who announced his resignation last week after being cited for
ethics violations. Twenty-eight percent said he wasn't treated
fairly and 23 percent said they did not know, according to the poll.
   Although 53 percent of the people surveyed said most or many
members of Congress take unethical advantage of their positions to
make outside income, 47 percent said their own representatives take
no such an advantage. Thirty-one percent said they did and 22
percent did not know.
   The poll, conducted for Newsweek by the Gallup Organization,
interviewed 750 adults by telephone Thursday and Friday. The margin
of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels on Saturday
spurned the new rightist president's proposal for dialogue,
dismissing it as a call to capitulate.
   The rejection came in a communique from the rebels' Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front broadcast on local radio stations.
There was no immediate reaction from the government.
   Despite their rejection of the offer to talk, the guerrillas
also said Saturday that they lifted a ban on road travel called to
protest the inauguration Thursday of the President Alfredo
Cristiani.
   Cristiani on Friday called for more regional efforts to end El
Salvador's civil war. He said bringing peace to this country was
just as important as dismantling the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan
rebels.
   He has pledged not to negotiate changes in the political system
with the rebels but has offered talks instead on integrating them
into civilian life.
   In their statement, the rebels said they stood ready to
negotiate a political solution to their nine-year war against the
U.S.-backed government. But they said Cristiani's proposal did not
offer them a chance to do so and that it was an ``invitation to
surrender.''
   The rebel communique instead invited El Salvador's political
parties to sponsor a peace dialogue.
   The rebels said the new president had been trying to project
``an image acceptable to the United States and the European
community, but the content of his speech was predominantly
confrontation, strictly faithful to the politics and economics of
Arena.''
   Arena is Cristiani's rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
The party takes a hard line on the war, and many observers expect
the fighting to intensify under the Arena government.
   About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have already died in the
civil war.
   Cristiani assumed power from President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a
Christian Democrat. Duarte is suffering from cancer and has left
the country for more chemotherapy.
   The rebels' traffic ban had paralyzed nationwide traffic since
Wednesday.
   ``All highways are reopened to the free circulation of
vehicles,'' said the rebel Radio Venceremos in Saturday's
broadcast. It said the rebels also ordered all guerrilla units ``to
suspend any further action'' against motorists.
   Guerrillas damaged or destroyed five vehicles and dynamited
power transformers and electrical transmission towers, but no
injuries were reported. The country's 245 gas stations were also
forced to remain closed for fear of rebel reprisals.
   Speaking at his news conference Friday, Cristiani reiterated
accusations made by Duarte that Nicaragua's ruling leftist
Sandinista regime was helping the Salvadoran guerrillas. The
Sandinistas have often denied such charges, claiming they provide
only moral support.
   Cristiani praised a Central American initiative aimed at
negotiating peaceful solutions to conflicts in Nicaragua and El
Salvador. The accords call for demobilizing the Nicaraguan rebels,
who now live in border camps in neighboring Honduras.

   Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen
Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse
occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from
their communist rulers.
   A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as
bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder.
   Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to
revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at
important intersections nearby. Tanks moved into place on what had
hours earlier been a rag-tag squatter's camp of tents for the
pro-democracy students.
   The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets
leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to
prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving
on the students.
   Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped
through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, one of the main
monuments to Chinese communism in the square. Torched buses and
army vehicles on the streets around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke.
   Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column
trotted toward the student encampment about 1 a.m. (noon EDT
Saturday). They took up positions to the east after a brief
skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students.
   More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the
People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled
down Changan Avenue to the north side.
   The few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as
they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes' monument. ``I'm
not afraid,'' several said as the heavily armed troops encircled.
   Hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square, many
dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle.
   Loudspeakers blaring government and student announcements
engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night.
   ``The government is corrupt, you've been tricked,'' the students
roared. The state-run speaker warned that troops would use every
means at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining
students would bear responsibility for the consequences.
   At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark,
and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale, the
socialist anthem. A Taiwan singer staging a hunger strike for
democracy took the microphone and proclaimed: ``We've achieved a
big victory. ... We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost
too much blood.''
   After the lights went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by
the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid
further bloodshed.
   They quickly filed out under the banners of their schools,
carrying the quilts and padded jackets that offered warmth during
the 22-day sit-in. Neither the students nor the Beijing residents
who arrived to show support could control their tears.
   ``Go with us,'' they told their supporters, who applauded the
students as they retreated. As they sobbed, many students defiantly
shouted: ``We shall return!'' and flashed V-for-victory signs.

   A man who disconnected his comatose son from
a life-support system while holding hospital staffers at gunpoint
six weeks ago was arrested for drunken driving early Saturday,
officials said.
   Rudy Linares, 23, was released on $300 bond after his arrest in
this Chicago suburb, police said.
   The arrest came two days after Linares was treated at a hospital
for suffering a violent reaction to an illegal drug.
   He was charged with driving while intoxicated, driving on a
suspended license and driving the wrong way on a one-way street,
said police Sgt. Jerry Erjavec.
   Linares checked himself into a 28-day alcohol detoxification
program at Mac Neal Memorial Hospital in nearby Berwyn, said his
attorney, Daniel Coyne.
   ``He's very relieved,'' Coyne said. ``He feels that by signing
himself in here, a great weight has been lifted from his
shoulders.''
   Linares drew national attention in April when he pulled a gun at
a Chicago hospital and held staff members at bay while he unhooked
his 15-month-old son from a life-support system.
   Linares, a Cicero house painter with two other children, cradled
the boy in his arms until he was sure the youngster died.
   The child had been in an irreversible coma since choking on a
balloon nine months earlier. Hospital officials had refused to
unhook him from life support despite the family's requests, citing
the possibility of prosecution.
   Linares was charged with murder, but a grand jury refused to
indict him and prosecutors decided not to pursue the charge. He
pleaded guilty May 18 to a misdemeanor weapons charge and was
released on condition he receive a psychological evaluation and be
treated if authorities recommended it.
   On Thursday, Linares was taken to Mac Neal after suffering a
violent reaction to PCP, an illegal drug also known as angel dust.

   Socialists pelted the daughter of a
conservative leader with garbage and rabbit skins as she arrived
for her wedding, setting off gun battles that injured at least 29
people, officials said Saturday.
   The wedding was attended by Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami
and Deputy Prime Minister Guido de Marco, both of the conservative
Nationalist Party. They were not injured.
   The clashes occurred Friday night in the village of Zejtun, a
Socialist stronghold seven miles from Valletta on this
Mediterranean island off Sicily.
   When Rose Abdilla, daughter of the local Nationalist Party
president, arrived at the church in a two-horse open carriage,
Socialist Party backers threw garbage and rabbit skins at her.
   She rushed into the church, protected by police, while the
onlookers insulted her and her father, Paul Abdilla.
   Police called in reinforcements when the prime minister and
deputy prime minister arrived.
   At one point, the crowd tried to surge into the church, and
police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Socialists who had
massed by then.
   Gun battles broke out between police and people in the crowd.
Some of them shouted anti-government slogans.
   Officials said 26 police officers were injured, 10 by gunfire.
Three other people were injured.
   The crowd gathered after a newspaper reported that the prime
minister would be acting as a witness at the wedding.
   Although his party has preached reconciliation since defeating
the Socialists in general elections two years ago, Malta remains
politically polarized.
   Since the election, Zejtun has earned the nickname ``the
Republic of Zejtun'' for forbidding the Nationalists from holding a
meeting in the village.
   De Marco told a news conference that arrests had been made. He
gave no number.
   Despite the clashes, the wedding went on as planned.

   Explosions leveled three buildings
at a gunpowder plant Saturday, injuring at least 18 people, blowing
out windows in nearby towns and shaking houses up to 13 miles away.
   The 5 a.m. explosions at the Hercules Powder Inc. plant knocked
down trees, tore off doors and damaged many homes and about 80
percent of the businesses in this north-central New Jersey
township, about 40 miles west of New York City, officials said. The
plant makes gunpowder for military and commercial uses.
   ``There's absolutely nothing there but dirt and it doesn't even
look that there was a building there,'' said Val Mazzucca, a
witness who flew over the site in a helicopter several hours after
the blast. ``All of the trees are blown over on the sides. It looks
like Mount St. Helens.''
   Three of about 40 buildings at the 6-square-mile complex were
destroyed, four others had fire damage and several others were
partly damaged, plant manager Dick Best said. He said he did not
know the cause of the blast.
   ``It was a chain reaction,'' he said. ``I don't know how and
why.''
   About 30,000 Jersey Central Power &amp; Light customers in a 10-mile
radius of the blast site lost power for two minutes after the
blast, said Eunice Mackie, a company spokesman.
   Salvatore Rappa said he was working inside the finishing area of
the plant when he heard an explosion.
   ``All I know is that the lights flickered on and off throughout
the whole building and in about 15 seconds there was the first
explosion,'' Rappa said. ``Everyone hit the deck and there was a
major panic.''
   About 50 employees were working on the overnight shift, Best
said. There apparently were no life-threatening injuries.
   A supervisor for Dover General Hospital said 12 Hercules
employees had been brought in. Nine of them and about half a dozen
townspeople were treated and released and three employees were
admitted, with injuries ranging from back pains to a concussion.
All were in stable condition, said supervisor Barbara Treverrow.
   An explosion on Feb. 22, 1985, at the company's Sayerville
plant, about 20 miles to the southwest, killed an employee and
injured four other people.
   Best said the material that exploded Sunday was a smokeless
propellant used in shotgun shells.
   He said that to limit damage, the plant is divided into
compartments that each contain no more than 1,000 pounds of
gunpowder. The gunpowder plant is located in a somewhat isolated
area near several small towns.
   ``There are windows blown out throughout the area,'' said Sgt.
Mike Hass, of the Randolph Police Department, about three miles
from Roxbury Township. Police said they received about 200 damage
reports.
   ``We're assisting, standing by at the businesses in terms of
looting that may occur,'' Hass said.
   Roxbury Fire Chief John Ward said a fire caused by the blast was
put out by 8 a.m.
   A resident of Flanders, about five miles away from the plant,
said he was awakened by four loud explosions.
   ``It blew me right out of bed,'' said John Larson. ``At 5:05 one
went off, then three more went off. The blinds blew right out from
the window.''
   Jay Brown, who lives half a mile from the plant, said: ``We saw
the flames go up and then we heard an explosion. The first one felt
like an earthquake. The second one blew out the windows of my house
and busted the garage door right off the frame.''
   Rudy Spagnola, a State Farm Insurance Co. agent with an office
in a shopping center about a mile from the plant, said the
explosion shook the blinds at his house in Morristown 13 miles away.
   ``I'm definitely upset. Who needs this?'' Spagnola said. ``It's
lucky it wasn't a weekday.''

   Smoke from burning vehicles cast a pall over
Tiananmen Square Sunday morning after violence that will leave a
permanent scar on China.
   The numbers of dead and wounded from military attacks on
demonstrators were estimated in the hundreds. Massive arrests are
inevitable along with purges in the Communist Party leadership.
   The military action made it clear the government was willing to
use brutal force against mainly unarmed and peaceful demonstrators
to ensure the privileges and power of an aging leadership and to
perpetuate the political system.
   Deng Xiaoping, China's 84-year-old senior leader, may have
forfeited his place as one of the 20th century's great statesmen _
his 10 years of economic reforms tarnished by his willingness to
have blood shed rather than relinquish political power.
   Premier Li Peng, who refused to meet with students and discuss
their pleas for greater democracy and instead declared martial law
in Beijing on May 20, has won the odium of millions.
   Other elder leaders who dredged up their hard-line ideologies
rather than listen to the pulse of the nation also will be known as
men who sanctioned the killings of young idealists.
   The People's Liberation Army betrayed the chants of the students
that ``the people's army loves the people'' _ reflecting the
respect many Chinese had for the army until Sunday morning.
   The crushing of the protests reaffirmed Deng's philosophy that
political stability is crucial for economic modernization and
social unrest is intolerable.
   But his quest for stability may be in jeopardy. Military force
will not quiet the resentment of official corruption expressed by
the students at Tiananmen.
   Troops in the streets may drive anti-government and anti-party
expressions underground for a while but they cannot eradicate them.
   Student leaders, referring to government suppression, spoke of a
``long winter'' coming that will affect the nation's faltering
economic plans.
   With the government divided and weakened by strife, problems of
inflation, unemployment and labor unrest will be unattended.
   If the conservatives push through their purge of Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang and other moderates who opposed the crackdown,
China could be deprived of a generation of creative and progressive
thinkers.
   The flow of desperately needed foreign investments will suffer
because of the political crisis. Tourism will decline.
   China and the United States, long at odds over human rights
issues, could be heading for cooler relations that will involve
U.S. willingness to provide technology and economic assistance.
   President Bush said Saturday he deeply deplored the decision to
use force ``against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss
of life.''
   Chinese leaders often note China's 4,000-year history and say
the Chinese have the wisdom and patience to outlast crises of the
moment.
   But Chinese observing the rapid changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe will not be satisfied with reciting catechisms of
communism and the evils of bourgeois liberalization.
   Chinese need only look back at the last Tiananmen Incident on
April 5, 1976, to note that violence can destroy those who initiate
it.
   On that date a radical clique seeking to cement its power
ordered out military units that killed about 100 people who had
gone to the square to mourn the late Premier Chou En-lai. Horror
and anger at the killings led to events that brought about the
downfall of the radicals six months later and the emergence of Deng
Xiaoping.

   Chinese PremierLi Peng, in a statement taped
before Sunday's bloody crackdown in Beijing, pledged China to work
to improve the world environment and concluded that the prospects
for people are ``bright.''
   Li, dressed in a Western-style suit, recorded the statement for
a global television broadcast from New York called ``Our Common
Future,'' which was intended to raise environmental consciousness.
   ``Human beings are now facing challenges from the gradual
warming of the climate on the global scale,'' Li said in Chinese.
``To curb the development of the tendency requires common efforts
by many countries and the whole world as well.''
   ``China, as a member of the international community, will
steadfastly honor its commitments,'' he said. ``I believe that
advanced countries should take more responsibility for
environmental problems and should make a higher commitment.''
   ``The prospects for human beings is bright,'' he concluded in
the recorded translation.
   The celebrity-filled broadcast Saturday, aimed at more than 1
billion people, was picked up satellite feeds from London, Moscow,
Australia, Brazil, Tokyo, Poland and elsewhere.
   Li recorded the statement before Chinese troops stormed
Tiananmen Square on Sunday to remove pro-democracy demonstrators
occupying it. Hundreds were killed and injured.

<HEAD>Pipeline Spews 13,200 Gallons of Oil Into River in Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRAIG, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ruptured pipeline spilled about 13,200
gallons of crude oil into the Yampa River, home to two endangered
species of fish, officials said.
   The Amoco Pipeline Co. line near here broke open early Friday,
said Moffat County Sheriff Jeff Corriveau. It was discovered when
an oil slick was spotted on the Yampa three miles below the point
where the pipe crosses the northwestern Colorado river.
   Amoco officials immediately turned off the pumps to the 6-inch
diameter line, stopping the flow of oil within a few hours, said
Jerry White, the company's area manager in Casper, Wyo.
   Amoco officials estimated that about 300 barrels, or about
13,200 gallons, spilled into the river. Crews were immediately
dispatched to throw oil-collection booms across the river.
   ``The spill is in the No. 1 area for the Colorado squawfish,''
which is endangered, said state Fish and Wildlife Service biologist
Harold Tyus. ``In the next few weeks, the squawfish will be in the
peak of their spawning season.''
   The endangered humpback chub also swims in the Yampa, as do game
fish such as pike, trout and catfish.
   The 106-mile pipeline links an oilfield near Craig with storage
tanks near Wamsutter in south central Wyoming. It was built 45
years ago, and rebuilt in 1986, and is pipeline is buried 3 feet
underground.
   ``I don't think there's any suggestion of sabotage, but we're
investigating and cleaning up at the same time,'' White said.
   The oil, traveling downstream at about 4 mph, is expected to
reach the Yampa's confluence with the Green River late Saturday or
early Sunday, Jim Knoy of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Administration's Denver office said Saturday.
   The oil will have to pass through rapids, which will help break
it up, Knoy said.
   Knoy said that if Amoco's estimate of the spill's size was
correct, no long-term cleanup will be needed.
   The cause of the rupture was being investigated, officials said.

   Chinese students and Chinese-Americans around the United States
reacted with anguish and anger Saturday to bloodshed in their
homeland and called on President Bush to condemn the military
assault on protesters in Beijing.
   ``Oh my God! Oh my God!'' cried Choi Soon, 32, breaking into
sobs as she listened to radio reports in a park across from San
Francisco City Hall. ``How can the government kill? Those are my
brothers and sisters in the square and they are being murdered.''
   About 300 protesters gathered at the Chinese consulate in San
Francisco.
   Chinese and Chinese-Americans also took their fear and anger to
the streets in Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans, Houston, St.
Paul, Minn.; and Buffalo, N.Y. In Connecticut, the state House held
a silent tribute.
   ``It's so horrible,'' Lea Liang said during a rally at the
Chinese consulate in New York by more than 300 chanting, screaming
and weeping protesters.
   ``I can't believe they used the army _ the People's Army _ on
the people,'' said Ms. Liang, a Chinese-American. ``This hurts very
much.''
   A smaller demonstration, attended by Mayor Edward I. Koch and
U.S. Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., was held in lower Manhattan within
sight of the Statue of Liberty.
   ``All of us here must say no to the government of China and to
the military suppression in China,'' organizer Alfred Lui told the
crowd.
   ``Down with a government that kills students,'' said a sign
carried by accountant Ivy Ng.
   In Los Angeles, about 50 people staged a sit-in on the steps of
Chinese consulate, weeping as the protesters played a recording of
what they said were telephone conversations with relatives and
friends in Beijing as they witnessed the Army sweep of Tiananmen
Square.
   ``We are very disappointed and angry with the Chinese
government,'' said Richard Leung, a protest organizer and student
at the University of California-Los Angeles. ``We urge the U.S.
authorities to make every effort to support human rights and stop
the bloodshed.''
   President Bush said in a statement from Kennebunkport, Maine,
Saturday, ``I deeply deplore the decision to use force against
peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.'' He called
for ``nonviolence, restraint and dialogue.''
   It was early Sunday in Beijing, 13 hours ahead of the eastern
United States, when Chinese troops stormed through masses of
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, shooting and beating
hundreds of people. At least 500 were reported killed.
   In St. Paul, about 250 Chinese students marched around the
Minnesota Capitol. Wearing black armbands and green and white
ribbons, a Chinese symbol of mourning, they bowed their heads in
memory of the slain.
   At a rally at Louisiana State University Medical Center, Gan Xia
Ge, a 31-year-old graduate student, said, ``I'm worried about my
brother. The army is just shooting people. He may be dead.''
   ``I'd like to be there with them, but I think we can also do
something here in America,'' said Philip Lam, a Los Angeles
demonstration organizer. ``I hope we get people outside of China to
support this movement, which is not for or against any political
party, but just for democracy.''
   About a dozen organizers, most of them students and
professionals from Hong Kong, distributed blue ribbons to
passers-by at the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Statue in Los Angeles'
Chinatown.
   ``The ribbons stand for freedom, dignity and hope for the
students in China,'' said Leung.
   An Iowa state senator who returned Friday from a three-week
exchange program in China said that when his group of U.S.
politicians met with the protesters they seemed to be bracing for
confrontation.
   ``You could sense that there was an uneasiness,'' Sen. Paul Pate
said. ``They said they knew that there was a crackdown coming.''
   Judith Shapiro, a scholar who met husband Liang Heng in China
during the 1970s and wrote two books about that country with him,
said the violence created a serious potential for civil war.
   ``I think that until today many students and intellectuals
believed that the Communist Party was genuinely trying to reform
itself from within,'' Ms. Shapiro said.
   ``But with the results of today's actions, the Chinese party has
lost any semblance of legitimacy for these people. These people
feel deeply betrayed; they're deeply angry,'' said Ms. Shapiro, who
works for the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think tank in
Elkins Park, Pa.
   The crackdown could badly damage China's ability to attract
needed dollars through tourism, exports and investments, a
professor said.
   ``It's not hard to imagine that a lot of people are going to be
reluctant to put money into China now for obvious reasons,'' Tufts
University political science professor Don Klein said in Boston. He
noted that the United States is second only to Japan in providing
tourists to China, which he said netted $2 billion from that
industry last year.
   The Connecticut House of Representatives interrupted a debate on
a prison overcrowding bill to stand in silence as a salute to the
Chinese students. Rep. Richard Tulisano told the hushed chamber in
Hartford, ``What is going on in China is what happened in this
country 200 years ago.''

   A CBS News correspondent and cameraman were
detained by the Chinese army while an NBC News crew had to dodge
police and bullets during the bloody suppression of the protest in
Beijing early Sunday.
   It was not immediately clear whether any of the journalists were
formally arrested or were being detained to prevent coverage of
Chinese troops that stormed Tiananmen Square, killing and wounding
scores of people.
   ``It's been very intense and tragic. They're seeing acts of
heroism that I don't think anyone expects to see in a lifetime,''
Joseph Angotti, senior vice president of news for NBC, said of
journalists at the scene.
   ``I've never heard the kind of strain in people's voices I've
heard today. A lot of fear is coming through on the phone lines,''
he said.
   Angotti said an NBC cameraman and sound man were unable to
contact the network for more than four hours after they got caught
in the chaos while recording events on the southern end of the
square.
   ``They got trapped on one side of the square,'' Angotti said.
``They literally had to go block by block taking cover in houses as
they went along because police kept clearing the streets. They were
shot at twice by police before they could get a couple of miles to
the hotel.''
   CBS News Correspondent Richard Roth and cameraman Derek Williams
were apparently taken away by the Chinese Army shortly after 4 p.m.
as they described the assault on the square, said CBS News
spokesman Tom Goodman.
   ``We're making every effort to locate them but it's very
difficult,'' he said.
   When CBS last heard from Roth, he was describing the scene at
the square.
   ``OK, we've got to get out of here,'' Roth said in an
increasingly shaky voice. ``They (the army) are going after Derek.
They're ripping away his camara. They are coming for us. We are
trying to get away.''
   Goodman said the sound of gunfire was then heard in the
background and Roth could be heard over his cellular telephone,
which was left on, saying either ``Oh no, oh no'' or ``I'll go,
I'll go.''
   Two Chinese-Americans in Roth's crew _ Dexter Leong, a soundman,
and Robert Lum, an assistant _ were able to blend in with the crowd
and returned to CBS headquarters in Beijing, Goodman said.
   Leong reported that none of the four were injured and another
CBS correspondent later said he believed Roth and Williams were
taken into the Great Hall by members of the Chinese Army.
   Leong later said: ``We were filming the event. Suddenly, army
soldiers appeared five feet behind us. They just grabbed the
camera, yanked it down. About five seconds after they grabbed they
camera they began to shoot'' into the crowd.
   Laura Wessner, an ABC spokeswoman, said all their broadcast crew
members were safe.
   ``Everything is fine. All our crews are fine,'' she said.
   She said Chinese authorities have not taken action to prevent
the crews from doing their jobs.
   A Cable News Network producer, Donna Liu, was carrying
videotapes through Tiananmen Square Sunday as the troops moved in
when she was approached by military officials who demanded that she
turn the tapes over.
   ``Her tapes were taken away and she slipped away before she
could get into any trouble with the authorities,'' said Rob Golden,
assistant foreign editor at CNN's Atlanta headquarters.
   The cable news program has two correspondents and three crews in
Beijing. Golden said the correspondents have been working out of
their hotel room while the crews were out in the square during the
massacre.
   To make up for the lack of video footage, CNN has been using
still photographs taken by one of the crew, Golden said.
   ``It's probably one of the most emotional days any of our people
have been through over there,'' Angotti said.

<HEAD>Jackson to Move to Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, considered a potential
candidate for mayor of Washington, said Saturday night that he
intends to move into a home he owns in the District of Columbia
once renovations are completed.
   But Jackson said in a telephone interview from Chicago that he
had not made any decision on whether he make the capital his legal
voting residence _ a move he would be required to make by November
if he is to become a candiate for mayor in the city's 1990
elections.
   Jackson will probably move into the house in August or
September, said a source close to Jackson, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Jackson, a long-time Chicago resident, purchased a home in the
district four years ago, but it has remained vacant and in need of
substantial repairs. Jackson began renovation work on the home this
year.
   Asked if he intends to move into the home when the work is
finished, Jackson said, ``Of course, yes.''
   Asked if he intends to make it his legal residence and to
register to vote in the city, Jackson answered, ``we have not made
such a decision.''
   Jackson has said repeatedly that he is in Washington several
times a week and he wants to live in the house rather than stay at
a hotel.
   Washington Mayor Marion S. Barry has the object of criminal
investigations involving drugs and has been beset by a series of
embarrassing disclosures about his personal life.
   A federal grand jury is investigating Barry's repeated visits to
the Washington hotel room of a man, Charles Lewis, who was later
convicted on drug charges in the Virgins Islands. Lewis faces more
charges here.
   Barry is completing his third term and is considering seeking
another term.
   Jackson and Barry are long-time friends from the civil rights
battles of the 1960s, and Jackson has said he would not run against
Barry for the mayoral position. But Jackson has declined to say
what he will do if Barry declines to run for a fourth term, as some
Barry advisers have urged.
   Jackson's Rainbow Coalition organization plans to expand its
Washington offices and establish most of its political and lobbying
operations in the city, a source in the organization said.
   Jackson hasn't decided whether to make Washington or Chicago the
principal headquarters of the organization, said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Cracks found in the ceilings and floors
of two test rooms in an underground nuclear waste repository could
cause problems with worker safety and waste retrieval, a technical
oversight expert said Saturday.
   The U.S. Department of Energy, however, had anticipated the
cracks in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant test rooms in
southeastern New Mexico and is still aiming for a September opening
date, said Ben McCarty, an agency spokesman.
   WIPP is a DOE project designed to store plutonium-contaminated
waste related to defense 2,150 feet below the surface in ancient
salt beds 26 miles southeast of Carlsbad.
   Lokesh Chaturvedi, deputy director of the Environmental
Evaluation Group, which is helping to monitor the project, said the
cracks pose two potential problems _ worker safety and the ease
with which waste can be retrieved from the site if there are
problems.
   Four test rooms _ each 300 feet long, 33 feet wide and 13 feet
high _ were excavated in March and April 1983. Researchers are
using the rooms to study the the behavior of salt collapsing around
55-gallon drums of nuclear waste, Chaturvedi said.
   ``Soon after the rooms were excavated, it was found that the
rate of (collapse) was three to four times higher than predicted,''
he said.
   That was a good sign, because the faster the rooms close, the
faster the waste will become entombed, Chaturvedi said. The drums
are expected to corrode away in 20 years, he said.
   But in 1985, a 4-inch-wide crack appeared wall-to-wall in the
floor of one of the rooms when 3-foot-diameter holes were being
drilled, Chaturvedi said.
   ``That was of concern because it showed salt moved in fast but
it was cracking because of impurities in the salt,'' he said.
   Then, in 1987, the DOE found two continuous fractures above the
roofs of two other test rooms _ one about 3{ feet above the ceiling
and another about 7{ feet above, Chaturvedi said.
   ``It posed dangers to workers who had equipment in the room, so
the DOE decided to clear out the rooms ... or have limited-access
rooms,'' said Chaturvedi, who learned about the cracks May 2.
   McCarty said the rooms are supposed to come down. ``It's just an
experiment,'' he said.
   Wendell Weart, chief WIPP scientist for Sandia National
Laboratories, said the anticipated, desirable effects of so-called
salt creep ``have been considered and retrieval is still assured.''
   McCarty said analysis of the cracking was not included in a
supplemental Environmental Impact Statement because there are
established mining procedures to prevent problems from the cracks.
   The procedures includied reinforcing the two rooms with the most
recent cracks with rock bolts. No waste will be placed in the
unbolted rooms, McCarty said.
   Weart said the rock bolts will assure that no loose slabs of
salt could fall and breach a waste drum, assuring ``adequate
stability through the retrieval period.''
   Chaturvedi, however, contended that if DOE officials ``put
thousands of drums ... in the rooms to be taken out, there might be
a problem in retrieving the waste because one cannot be absolutely
be certain that rock-bolting will keep the ceiling as well as the
floor from buckling.''
   The DOE has a five-year experimental and operational phase in
which to put waste in the rooms and take it out.
   ``The whole thing lies on the DOE plan _ do they want to place
waste temporarily instead of permanently? If they were simply to
make the decision permanently, then we would not have to worry
about these questions,'' he said.
   Chaturvedi said his group ``would simply like the DOE not to put
a large quantity of waste underground without first making certain
that they need to leave it there.''
   His group, funded by the DOE, is charged with technical
evaluation of WIPP for the health and safety of the public and the
environment.

<HEAD>$20 Million Con Man Receives Stiff Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of bilking hundreds of people
of $20 million through a pyramid scheme received a 15-year prison
sentence with an unusual 10-year probation, but promised investors
they'd get their money back.
   Authorities, however, said the reimbursement plan that Stephen
L. Smith proposed Friday was just another attempt to mislead
investors in his SH Oil and Gas Exploration company.
   Circuit Judge J. Tim Strickland in Bartow sentenced Smith on
Wednesday to 15 years in prison, and banned him from owning an
expensive home, driving an exotic automobile or doing consulting
work for 10 years after his release.
   Smith, 38, will also be prohibited from making more than $30,000
a year during the probation, and must give lectures on the evils of
white-collar crime at colleges and high schools.
   Smith, who has also been sentenced to 10 years behind bars on
federal bank fraud violations, could be released from prison after
four years.
   His attorney, Montjoy Trimble of Lexington, Ky., said he would
appeal Strickland's probation sentence.
   Smith pleaded guilty in March to 98 state felony charges. He was
accused of cheating about 700 investors out of $20 million between
1979 and 1987 through a $125 million pyramid scheme.
   A creditors meeting at bankruptcy court in Tampa on Friday
marked the first time that Smith answered questions from both
investors and investigators since the state closed SH Oil in
December 1987.
   Smith promised 50 investors who attended that he would provide a
reimbursement plan to ``handle any and all alleged shortfalls
you've had since SH Oil was closed.''
   Smith didn't elaborate on the plan during the meeting, but said
it was designed to refund lost investments within 10 to 15 years.
   He said the plan would pay investors $1 to $1.5 million annually
for nine to 14 years, then pay them a lump sum of $11.5 million to
$18 million in 10th or 15th year.
   Attorney Allan Watkins, hired to help SH Oil's federal trustee,
called Smith's plan ``Ouija board'' economics.
   Terry Smith, the trustee administering $10 million to $15
million worth of seized SH Oil assets, said the reimbursement plan
is ``taking assets and playing investment games with them.''
   ``I say just give the money back to creditors and let them
manage their own money,'' Terry Smith said.
   Stephen Smith filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Feb. 24. He claimed
assets of about $15 million and liabilities of about $250 million.
   Smith, who remains free on $350,000 in state and federal bonds,
is scheduled to report to Saufley federal prison near Pensacola on
Wednesday, his attorney said.

<HEAD>Health Workers Say Prostitution and Prejudice Hindering AIDS Efforts</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Aids, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prostitution and prejudice against homosexuals
are hindering efforts to control the spread of AIDS in developing
countries, a group of international health workers said Saturday.
   They spoke in Montreal, where the Fifth International Conference
on AIDS opens Sunday and 12,000 delegates are expected to attend.
   Prostitution has been a major factor in the ``wildfire-like
spread of AIDS through Central Africa,'' said Chandra Mouli, head
of an AIDS education project in Zambia.
   ``Because of high levels of unemployment ... young women often
have no practical alternatives to prostitution.''
   The World Health Organization has received reports of 23,000
cases of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in Africa
but many cases are not reported and the figure is believed to be
closer to 100,000.
   Poverty also has contributed to the large numbers of male
prostitutes in Thailand, according to Natee Teerarojjanapongs, a
Thai specialist.
   He said there have been few attempts to educate Thailand's
homosexuals and test them for the presence of the virus of the
deadly disease.
   Norma Kaminsky, a Costa Rican community health worker, said that
in Latin American countries most AIDS victims have been homosexual
men and hemophiliacs.
   Central and South American countries have reported 11,000 AIDS
cases to the World Health Organization. The number of AIDS victims
in the United States is nearing 100,000.
   Ms. Kaminsky said poor relations between police and Latin
American homosexual communities have hampered the detection and
prevention of AIDS.
   ``Lack of trust in the authorities has been a major obstacle,''
she said. ``Homosexuality has been repressed by the police, gay
bars have been closed and gays have been pursued.''
   A government-sponsored television campaign in Chile to educate
the public about AIDS encountered strong social opposition, said
Alonso de la Carrera, a Santiago-based health worker.
   When the messages were broadcast in March following long delays,
they were aimed exclusively at the heterosexual population and
contained no concrete information on prevention of AIDS, he said.
   African governments are struggling to control the AIDS epidemic,
the health workers from that continent said.
   A study in the Kagera region of northwestern Tanzania found
4,000 orphans were AIDS carriers, said Dr. F.J. Owenya, a Red Cross
worker.
   He said that in addition to prostitution in the region, the
common practice of sharing of unsterilized instruments such as
razor blades and safety pins to pierce ears has contributed to the
spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Man Hangs On to Raised Drawbridge as Wheelchair Rolls Away</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man in a wheelchair found himself
caught in the middle of a drawbridge while it was raised, forcing
him to hang by his fingertips as his chair plunged into the water,
witnesses and authorities said.
   Charles Hisoire, 38, grabbed the edge of the bridge and hung
over the Intracoastal Waterway for about two minutes before he was
rescued by a man riding his bicycle home.
   ``I went running like crazy,'' said the rescuer, Marek
Dabrowski, 46, who added that at first he thought the man had
fallen into the water.
   ``But when I got there, he was hanging on by his fingers. I
grabbed his forearm, then lifted him out by the collar and belt
before the bridge went back down.''
   Hisoire said he heard the drawbridge bell ring but was
distracted because he had been talking with a fisherman. He had
almost made it to the center of the span when the tender began
raising the middle bridge, a police report said.
   ``I started yelling and screaming and waving my hands so the man
in the shed would see me,'' Hisoire said Friday. ``But he kept
raising the bridge, and I kept on sliding down.''
   The tender, Thomas Goss, said he checked the bridge before
raising it and did not see anyone. An 8-foot sign may have
partially blocked his view, police said.
   ``I never saw that man before in my life until that bridge was
closed,'' Goss said.
   Hisoire, who was paralyzed from the waist down in January after
he fell from a wall onto a concrete walk, said he was thankful that
Dabrowski happened along.
   Police agreed.
   ``If that bridge would have closed, it would have amputated his
arms,'' said Palm Beach Sgt. Mike Galvin. ``He would have fallen
into the (water) and we would have never found him.''

<HEAD>Post: Fawn Hall Admits Cocaine Use While Working for North</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North's former secretary has told
federal drug investigators that she was a ``weekend'' cocaine user
during 1985-1987 while she was employed by the National Security
Council and the Pentagon and had access to sensitive government
documents, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions that Fawn
Hall told a Drug Enforcement Administration agent of her cocaine
use during the agency's investigation of drug use and sales at
nightclubs in Georgetown, an exclusive area of the city.
   Hall, who testified at congressional hearings about her role in
disposing of documents in the Iran-Contra affair, told the agent
she was a ``weekend'' cocaine user during the three-year period and
provided investigators with names of some alleged drug dealers, the
Post quoted unnamed sources as saying.
   The former White House aide revealed her drug use to DEA agents
during an interview in the Washington office of her attorney, Plato
Cacheris, on Aug. 7, 1987, just two months after her Iran-Contra
testimony, the sources told the newspaper.
   ``I am not confirming any part of the story,'' said Cacheris,
reached at his home Saturday night.
   Hall is not a target of the DEA probe but said she is a
potential grand jury witness in the ongoing investigation, the Post
reported.
   There were no allegations Hall sold drugs or ever used them at
the White House, according to the sources.
   Hall now lives in California where she is pursuing an acting
carrer, the Post said.
   Hall's close friends were surprised to learn of her acknowledged
drug use.
   ``I consider myself her best friend and I can't believe this,''
Katy Dickey, who works at a Washington public relations firm, told
the Post.
   Arturo Cruz Jr., son of a former Nicaraguan Contra leader who
dated Hall in 1986 said he never saw her use drugs on the occasions
he accompanied her to several Georgetown nightspots.

<HEAD>Ceremony Marks Sutherland's Fourth Year Of Captivity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of hostage Thomas Sutherland
continued a ``personal odyssey'' into her husband's past Friday to
mark the end of his fourth year of captivity in Lebanon.
   ``It's very, very special for me to be here,'' said Jean
Sutherland at an outdoor ceremony on the campus at Iowa State
University, where she met and married Thomas Sutherland when both
were students in the 1950s.
   Mrs. Sutherland arrived in Ames from Scotland, where she had
visited the farm of her husband's family. On June 9, she will
participate in a ceremony for her husband at Colorado State
University in Fort Collins, Colo., where the couple taught before
leaving for American University in Beirut.
   ``We went as a team, and we are still there as a team, and we
are still working together,'' said Mrs. Sutherland.
   She has continued teaching at American University since her
husband's abduction on June 9, 1985. Sutherland was dean of
agriculture at the school.
   ``I'm doing a personal odyssey for Tom _ to go to Tom's sources
and gather a vitality and strength that I can take back to
Beirut,'' Mrs. Sutherland, 55, told a crowd of about 40 people
gathered under the bell tower at the center of the Iowa State
campus.
   After the ceremony, the school's bell tolled 48 times _ once for
each month Sutherland has been held hostage.
   ``I will take this back to American University and we will get
it into the newspaper so that Tom will know he has this lifeline,''
said Mrs. Sutherland.
   She spoke in front of a grove of trees tied with yellow ribbons.
Beside her was a banner with her husband's picture and the words,
``We have not forgotten.''
   She said she harbors no bitterness toward the U.S. government,
which has been unable to obtain the release of Sutherland or eight
other Americans held hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. Anderson, also an Iowa State graduate, was captured March
16, 1985.
   Mrs. Sutherland said she hopes the Bush administration can make
progress that Ronald Reagan was unable to accomplish as president.
   ``We have a chance to do something with the new
administration,'' she said.
   ``We hope that Tom will be out before the next year elapses,''
said Mrs. Sutherland's father, William G. Murray of Ames.
   John Anderson, interim director of university relations at Iowa
State, presented Mrs. Sutherland with a book containing signatures
of Iowa State students, faculty and other Iowans urging the release
of Sutherland and the other hostages.
   ``We hope that it can get to Tom to show that there is solid and
broad-based support for him and the others in Beirut,'' Anderson
told her. ``We pledge to continue these observances for as long as
they're necessary.''

   Police in Czechoslovakia broke up a
meeting of the Movement for Civil Freedom and detained about 70
people who were attending but released them all after questioning,
a rights activist said Friday.
   Activist Petr Uhl, who was reached in Prague, capital of
Czechoslovakia, by telephone, said uniformed and plainclothes
police entered about 20 minutes after the meeting began in a Prague
restaurant on Thursday, made identity checks and took away
participants for questioning.
   Uhl, who did not attend, said two participants, Ladislav Lis and
Rudolf Battek, refused to leave voluntarily and were removed by
force. All those questioned were back home after about two hours.
   The Movement, a non-conformist group formed last October, calls
for political pluralism and a return to private ownership.
   Uhl said that he, Jan Urban, Sasha Vondra and Milan Simecka were
invited by the Vienna-based Helsinki Federation of Human Rights to
go to Paris for the current Conference on the Human Dimension, but
they have not received travel documents.
   Vondra is a spokesman for the Charter 77 human rights group.

   Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic priest,
two policemen and four civilians in separate attacks, and police
said Friday they increased security for Colombia's police chief
after learning he is on a drug cartel's assassination list.
   Also Friday, leftist guerrillas freed four engineers of the
Brazilian state oil company Petrobras who were kidnapped in
Colombia and held 43 days in the tropical interior, a company
official said.
   The Rev. Sergio Restrepo was killed Thursday by unidentified
gunmen near Tierralta, about 280 miles north of Bogota in an area
where guerrillas are active, authorities said. Police had no motive
for the slaying.
   Late Thursday, in the western city of Pereira, armed men entered
a restaurant and sprayed it with gunfire, killing two men and two
women and wounding six people, police said.
   Pereira is capital of the coffee-growing state of Risarlda.
Risarlda's governor, Diego Patino, and two aides left the
restaurant minutes before the attack, but police said the attack
apparently was not directed at them.
   Early Friday, two policemen were shot to death near Anoril,
about 200 miles north of Bogota, in an apparent guerrilla ambush.
   Meanwhile, authorities in Bogota said they were strengthening
security for the national police chief, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla,
and Gen. Rafael Munoz, chief of the police force's anti-narcotics
division, after discovering they were on an assassination list of
the feared Medellin cartel of cocaine traffickers.
   The existence of the list was disclosed by Padilla, who said it
also listed the head of the security police, Gen. Miguel Maza
Marquez, who escaped a car-bomb assassination attempt Tuesday that
left six dead and about 30 wounded.
   Colombia has been plagued for years by violence carried out by
drug traffickers, right-wing vigilantes and leftist guerrilla
groups.
   Jose Ferndandez, manager of Colombian operations for Petrobras,
said in an interview broadcast by the national radio network RCN
that no ransom was paid for the kidnapped engineers' release
Friday. He spoke in Bucaramanaga.
   Fernandez said political issues were discussed in negotiations
with the captors, the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army.
   The engineers _ three Brazilians and a Colombian _ were handed
over to Brazilian labor union officials who had been trying to
obtain the men's freedom.
   Guerrillas seized the four during an April 20 attack on an oil
drilling site near Barancabermeja, 170 miles northeast of Bogota.
   It was part of a guerrilla campaign to pressure the governmment
into nationalizing Colombia's petroleum industry. The group this
year also has kidnapped mayors, congressmen, other politicians and
oil company workers, all of them freed after the captors expounded
on their opposition to private and foreign investment in oil.
   The guerrillas also have regularly bombed important oil
pipelines.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. magistrate Friday ordered three
environmental activists held without bail in an alleged conspiracy
to sabotage nuclear plants in three Western states, but released
the man described as their ``guru.''
   U.S. Magistrate Morton Sitver released David Foreman, 42, the
founder of the radical activist group Earth First!, on a $50,000
unsecured bond after a 2{-hour detention hearing.
   Sitver ordered Mark Leslie Davis, 39, Marc Baker, 37, and
Margaret ``Peggy'' Millett, 35, all of Prescott, held for trial.
Foreman, a Tucson resident, is charged with conspiracy, while the
other three face a count each of conspiracy and three types of
property destruction.
   Sitver said Davis and Mrs. Millett were flight risks as well as
dangers to the community and he called Baker dangerous.
   In arguing for Foreman's detention, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Roger Dokken claimed the activist was the ringleader.
   ``Mr. Foreman is the worst of the group,'' Dokken said. ``He
sneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader,
sort of the guru to get all of this going. I don't like to use the
analogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. They
just send their munchkins out to do it.''
   Defense lawyers said the alleged conspirators always notified
the public during what they called ``monkeywrenching'' operations,
a reference to a book written by the late Edward Abbey describing a
fictional plot by ``eco-raiders'' to blow up a dam.
   Foreman's attorney, Richard Sherman of Jackson, Wyo., said he
was gratified by Foreman's release but added that all the
defendants should have been treated with the same consideration.
   ``Apparently the magistrate felt they were a danger to society.
I respectfully disagree,'' he said.
   Baker, Davis and Millett were committed to attacks on the Palo
Verde and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of Wintersburg, Ariz.,
and San Luis Obispo, Calif., respectively, and the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons center near Denver, according to FBI testimony
based on tape-recorded conversations.
   FBI Agent Lori Bailey testified that Davis, Baker and Mrs.
Millett took an undercover agent to a spot near Wenden, Ariz.,
about 75 miles west of here, late Tuesday to practice knocking down
metal powerline towers.
   The tower they chose provides power for a pumping station of the
Central Arizona Project, which carries water from the Colorado
River to Arizona's interior.
   FBI agents on the ground and in a U.S. Customs Service
helicopter arrested Davis and Baker at the site, but Mrs. Millett
slipped through and escaped, Miss Bailey testified.
   Foreman was arrested Wednesday morning in Tucson, and Mrs.
Millett was arrested in Prescott Wednesday afternoon, Miss Bailey
said.
   The FBI had been investigating the alleged conspiracy since a
May 1986 attempt to short-circuit Palo Verde powerlines by throwing
metal cables across high-tension wires, she said.
   Miss Bailey testified that the undercover agent accompanied
Davis to Tucson several times and saw Foreman give Davis $580 and
later $100 to use in training two- or three-person groups for the
strikes.
   Foreman opposed the idea of knocking out a CAP pumping station
as a useless goad against public sentiment but was enthusiastic
about hitting nuclear facilities, Miss Bailey said.
   The magistrate set Foreman's surety bond for $50,000 but
accepted his signature for release. Sitver also ordered Foreman,
who has written a field manual called ``Ecodefense: A Field Guide
to Monkeywrenching,'' to supply names and addresses of any of his
publishers.
   Foreman's book offers instructions on such actions as toppling
power-line towersw, putting spikes into trees to discourage loggers
with chain saws and knocking bulldozers and helicopters out of
order by putting sand in engine oil.
   But the book carries a disclaimer of being ``for entertainment
purposes only,'' saying, ``No one involved with the production of
this book ... encourages anyone to do any of the stupid, illegal
things contained herein.''

   A Communist Party struggling to keep
itself and Poland's economy afloat is competing against an
invigorated Solidarity slate of candidates in an election seen as
the freest in Eastern Europe in four decades.
   The elections Sunday for seats in the current one-house
parliament and a new Senate are also viewed as a huge gamble for
both sides.
   About 80 percent of Poland's 27 million eligible voters are
expected to vote.
   Campaigning ended Friday with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
taping a television message and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
Polish leader, delivering a rare television address.
   Walesa urged restraint on both sides and said many people in the
government were worried about the election's outcome. Jaruzelski
made a similar appeal for restraint.

but said Friday that continued use on apples raised public doubts
about the safety of America's food supply. The chemical has been
labeled a possible carcinogen, although tests are continuing.
   ``We should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of
restoring consumer confidence,'' said John McAlister, a spokesman
for Selah-based Tree Top Inc., the nation's largest apple juice
maker.
   But other industry figures said the action is unlikely to help
the current crop, which has turned into a financial disaster.

   A government watchdog says $1.6 trillion in
private pension funds are subject to potential fraud and abuse
because of loose regulations and lax enforcement of federal pension
laws.
   Labor Department Inspector General J. Brian Hyland said in a
report to Congress on Friday that the problems that leave the
pension system open to abuse are much like those that triggered the
savings and loan crisis.
   Unless Congress acts quickly to strengthen the laws and require
the government to improve oversight of pension funds the potential
exists for a ``nightmare'' that would dwarf the S&amp;L crisis, Hyland
said in the report.
   ``As, unfortunately, has been demonstrated by the recent savings
and loan crisis, government regulation of an industry does not
ensure that invested assets are protected,'' he said.

   With much fanfare, authorities Sunday are opening
a seven-mile stretch of Interstate 90 that has the dubious
distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever
built.
   It is part of a $1.46 billion highway project for the
mushrooming Seattle metropolis to build roads that probably will be
badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994.
   For the time being, the new link between Seattle and Bellevue
across Lake Washington brings welcome relief from the twice-daily
creep across the lake's two existing four-lane spans that become
jammed by fender-benders.
   Commuters also say goodbye to an infamous I-90 lane that
switched direction depending on the commute. With no barrier to
separate traffic, motorists tagged it the ``death lane.''
   At about $200 million a mile, the freeway has set a record for
costliness.

   When 12,000 people gather Sunday for the biggest
AIDS conference ever, they will hear grim reports on the social and
economic toll of the epidemic but little encouragement about the
medical race to stop it.
   The Fifth International Conference on AIDS is a gathering of all
of the big-name researchers and physicians, as well as their
supporting casts, who this decade have made AIDS a profession and
livelihood as well as a tragedy.
   The obvious and easy discoveries have been made, so the product
of the conference will be thousands of updates on the painstakingly
tiny steps necessary for science to learn to thwart the AIDS virus
and repair its destruction.
   No clearly superior successor to AZT, the only approved AIDS
drug, is expected to emerge from the 4,500 planned presentations,
nor is there likely to be an effective vaccine to protect people
from catching HIV, the AIDS virus.

   May rains have eased farmers' worries
about another drought and have lowered grain prices, but consumers
can probably still expect the biggest rise in food prices in eight
years, economists say.
   ``It's 200 percent better. Last year was grim,'' says Doug
Miller, who farms 350 acres in St. Joseph County in north-central
Indiana.
   Generous spring rains provided a breather from drought in the
Midwest and sent grain prices tumbling on commodity markets, but
they haven't come close to replenishing parched soil deep down or
washing out predictions for a food price increase of up to 7
percent.
   The drought of '88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and
soybean production 20 percent. Then, a dry winter, coupled with
dust storms and sub-arctic freezes, devastated winter wheat
production, with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor
or very poor shape as the harvest approaches.

   The Germans thought the diminutive horse soldiers
with Oriental features were devils when they first invaded Europe
in the 5th century with Attila the Hun at their head.
   Nine centuries later, the Middle East recoiled in horror as
another Eurasian horde led by Tamerlane razed cities and stacked
human skulls into towering pyramids.
   The Chinese even built The Great Wall of China in the 3rd
century to keep out the havoc-wreaking warriors.
   But scholars say the Eurasian nomads were not the simple
barbarians history often has portrayed them as. Situated along key
trade routes linking Asia and Europe, the nomadic tribes had a
class system and customs, and invented saddles, the game of polo
and bow-stringed instruments.
   ``They created their own culture in spite of being viewed as
barbarians by the sedentary population,'' said Dr. Vladimir
Basilov, chief curator of the Soviet exhibit, ``NOMADS: Masters of
the Eurasian Steppe,'' which opened June 4 at the Denver Museum of
Natural History.
   ``We shouldn't think that they just rode with their animals _
dirty and joyful with their food. Again, they created their own
culture.''
   The exhibit, which covers a 3,000-year span of the nomadic
culture, represents the largest cultural exchange in the field of
natural history between the United States and the Soviet Union
   Featuring nearly 1,400 artifacts, the exhibit began its U.S.
tour in February at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County. It will remain in Denver through Sept. 10, and will make
its final stop at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. The
exhibit also has been shown in Japan, Finland and London.
   The artifacts were collected from eight museums across the
Soviet Union and include some that never have been displayed in the
Soviet Union, museum officials said.
   Basilov, who has worked on the project for about 10 years, said
the three U.S. sites were chosen because they were large enough to
accommodate the exhibit's size.
   From mannequins modeling brilliantly colored clothing to a tiny
bronze lock molded in the shape of a deer, the exhibit provides an
unusual glimpse into the nomadic culture.
   Among the artifacts is a full-size suit of golden armor,
complete with headdress that was uncovered in the tomb of a
warrior. There are examples of weaponry; cooking and eating
utensils carved from wood and gourds, and small wooden trunks.
   The yurt, a rounded tent-like structure with a wool covering to
keep out the rain, provides a look at the nomadic home life.
Inside, the tent is divided for men and women in the traditional
setup.
   Delicate, carved jewelry and a silver-and-gilt saddle arch and
other ornaments also are in the display.
   Roaming along the Eurasian Steppe, a grassland area ranging from
northern China to Europe, the nomadic tribes thrived from 800 B.C.
into the early 20th century. Some of the well-known leaders were
Attila the Hun, and Kublai Khan and Tamerlane, descendants of
Genghis Khan.
   The tribes moved animal herds from pasture to pasture, and
traveled along the Silk Road, a major trade route used to transport
silk and other goods from China to India and the Middle East.
   Museum officials said the nomads have been credited with helping
develop economic trade, and sharing ideas on religion, art and
technology.
   ``They invented their own dwellings that could be transported
from one place to another,'' Basilov said. ``They thought about the
possibility to make everything they possess light, not heavy, not
breakable, so convenient to their way of life.''
   Among their inventions were the trousers, saddles and harnesses
for horses and bow-stringed instruments, the curator said.
   Although there still are nomads living in the Soviet Union and
parts of Mongolia, Basilov said they have settled into a more
sedentary lifestyle, such as sheepherders moving their flocks
between permanent dwellings.
   But, the way of life still has ``the flavor of their own essence
of culture. Some elders that live today remember that in their
youth they had this way of life,'' he said.
   Basilov received his doctorate in anthropology from the
Mikloukho-Maclay Institute of Ethnography in Moscow, part of the
Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He has held several
positions, including senior researcher and scientific secretary at
the institute. Currently, he heads the institute's Department of
Central Asian and Kazakhstan Research.
   He believes the exhibit is unique because its message is that
the nomads were not just barbaric tribes.
   Although Basilov has worked on the project for more than a
decade, it still fascinates him: ``The more you work, the more
interest you have in different fields of this very interesting
culture.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like the bubbling lava burps and smoke plumes of
a sleepy volcano, the dormant corporate takeover business is
showing signs of pre-eruption life.
   The biggest belch came from financier Carl Icahn, who dumped his
17.3 percent stake of Texaco Inc. this past week for $2.07 billion
cash in one behemoth trade.
   It took three big Wall Street brokerages to handle the record
block of 42.32 million shares sold for $49 each. The deal riveted
attention on Icahn and raised speculation he would use the money to
buy, or threaten to buy, another big company.
   A flurry of speculative buying in USX Corp. stock suggested that
piggybacking investors reckoned Icahn would chase the oil-steel
giant, one of his old targets. He remains a significant stockholder
in USX.
   The Icahn news was all the more dramatic because it came against
the background of a slump in the mergers &amp; acquisitions business
this year after a frenzy in 1988.
   Securities Data Co., a research concern that follows takeover
activity, says the value of deals tumbled to $74.36 billion in the
first quarter of this year from $137.17 billion a year earlier.
   Icahn, of course, declined to disclose his takeover agenda. But
the cunning investor has become known for bold and unpredictable
moves that sometimes have stupefied followers and critics alike.
   More than three years ago he outfoxed Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo to acquire Trans World Airlines. Later he stunned the
airline business by making a last-minute though unsuccessful run at
USAir Group Inc.
   Contrary to widespread expectations, Icahn not only has kept TWA
but evidently turned it into a moneymaker. He even has ordered a
fleet's worth of new Airbus jetliners, contradicting some union
claims that he wouldn't invest money in TWA, which has some of the
industry's oldest jetliners.
   At the same time, however, Icahn has been using TWA's assets to
raise money for other adventurous investments _ including his much
publicized stake in Texaco as it struggled out of bankruptcy a year
ago.
   Icahn plans to raise an additional $300 million soon by selling
TWA bonds backed by collateral that ranges from airport-landing
slots to spare light bulbs. The Wall Street Journal calls the
offering ``light bulb bonds.''
   If Icahn combined that money with the cash raised from the
Texaco stock sale, he could borrow several times that amount to
launch a takeover of a company worth at least $10 billion.
   Icahn's maneuvering wasn't the only rumble that stock
speculators heard this past week. Unionists at two other airlines,
Eastern and Northwest, were maneuvering to align themselves with
financiers who expressed buying interest in those companies. Also,
a Canadian company chasing Dunkin' Donuts upped its stake in the
chain.
   And in what some would call the morbid side of takeover
speculation, toy giant Hasbro Inc.'s stock shot up on word that
chairman Stephen Hassenfeld was hospitalized in intensive care with
pneumonia. Such speculation often accompanies serious illness or
deaths of top executives.
   In other business news this past week:
   _Government statistics suggested the economy has slowed, easing
pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates up and
rallying the stock and bond markets. Though unemployment fell in
April, new-job growth hit a three-year low. Other figures showed
construction spending barely rose in April and productivity shrank
in the first quarter.
   _Retailers reported depressed sales for April, suggesting
consumers are cutting back to save money and pay debts. The figures
also suggested Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., the No. 1 retailer, suffered
from declining shopper interest in its revamped low-price strategy
aimed at competing with fast-growing rivals.
   _Next-century innovations were announced for two staples of many
American homes, the television and the Bible. Nielsen Media
Research said it was developing a ``passive people meter'' that
would actually watch viewers to determine which ones were watching
what shows and when they left the room. Franklin Computer, a Mt.
Holly, N.J. company, unveiled an electronic version of the
Scriptures delivered by a new hand-held computer.

   Financial analysts and investors who proclaimed
a couple of months ago that interest rates were peaking are feeling
pretty good about themselves right now.
   Since late March, long-term interest rates in the government
securities market have fallen from roughly 9.3 percent to 8.5
percent.
   As for short-term interest rates, yields on three-month Treasury
bills have dropped over the same period from 9.4 percent to 8.6
percent.
   The nation's major banks, which have raised their prime lending
rates by stages from 8.5 percent to 11.5 percent since early 1988,
now seem poised to lower them by at least half a percentage point.
   All they are awaiting, analysts say, is the slightest signal
from the Federal Reserve that it is ready to begin relaxing its
credit policy in response to evidence that the economy has slowed.
   The latest exhibit for that case came Friday, when the Labor
Department reported employment growth of 101,000 in May, only about
half of what private economists had forecast.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said what expansion occurred during the month was ``very slow'' and
limited to just a few industries.
   The news helped propel the stock market to new highs since the
1987 crash, extending a rally that began last November.
   ``The market is going up for the right reasons,'' declared
Stephen Leeb in his investment advisory letter Indicator Digest.
   ``In the past two weeks evidence has begun to mount that the
economy is decelerating in an orderly fashion, making a `soft
landing' an increasingly likely prospect.''
   Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. foresees this
sort of ``soft landing'' script: Interest rates continue downward
as the inflation rate settles back to an annual rate of about 4
percent in the second half of the year.
   ``The Fed would certainly ease within the next month or so,'' he
added, ``and the stock market would continue to rise, outperforming
cash instruments, as investors appraised lower interest rates and a
continued high level of corporate profits.''
   Many investors evidently saw similar visions in the past week,
bidding up stocks to new recovery highs after a brief round of
selling following the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,517.83, up 23.06 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.18 to
181.49; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 6.42 to 451.63, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 4.46 at 360.47.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 194.15 million shares a day, up
from 169.79 million the week before.
   Amid the growing number of enthusiasts talking up the
possibility of record highs in the Dow before the year is out,
there are still quite a few doubters.
   Just suppose, some ask, that lower interest rates encourage the
pace of the economy to pick up again and inflation comes back to
haunt the markets just when that demon was supposedly subdued?
   ``Recent euphoria has tended to overlook a few unpleasant
details,'' says Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   ``We suspect that the anti-inflationary struggle in the U.S. is
less of a complete victory than the current consensus believes.''
Before that battle is won, he says, rates may well climb back above
their recent highs.
   And that is likely to lead, he maintains, to a ``hard landing''
_ in other words, a recession _ in 1990.
