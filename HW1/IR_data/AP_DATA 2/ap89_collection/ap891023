   A suspect in a drug investigation was shot to
death in Rockefeller Center by federal agents Monday after a drug
buy went sour and the man drove off, dragging an agent down the
street, authorities said.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration agent, who rolled off the
car before it crashed into the back of a bus, suffered minor
injuries, officials said. No one else was hurt.
   The violence occurred around 7 p.m. on 50th Street in
Rockefeller Center, an area popular with tourists. More than 100
people watched as the suspect was handcuffed, then treated for a
chest wound on the ground next to the car.
   The suspect was dead when taken to Bellevue Hospital, said
hospital administrator Peter Schectman. The man was not immediately
identified.
   According to DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper, another undercover
agent had arranged to buy 4 pounds of pure cocaine from the
suspect. Once the agent saw the cocaine, a signal was given and
other officers approached the car to arrest the man, Cooper said.
   As they identified themselves, the suspect drove off, she said.
An agent got caught in the car and was dragged along for about 100
feet.
   The agent fired two shots and rolled off the car into the street
as another agent fired at least one shot, Cooper said.
   The suspect was not armed, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A physician recommended for the U.S. Surgeon
General's post says the nation must begin thinking about AIDS as a
disease that strikes whole families, not just adults.
   ``We have to think of the children who will be sick,'' Dr.
Antonia C. Novello said Monday. ``...we also have to think of the
children who will be orphaned when the parents die. It's a family
context. If we think of AIDS in a family context, I think we will
be much more forceful.''
   Novello, 45, has been recommended by Dr. Louis Sullivan,
secretary of Health and Human Services, to succeed Dr. C. Everett
Koop as surgeon general. She is deputy director of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National
Institutes of Health.
   Novello, a native of Puerto Rico, has yet to be nominated by
President Bush. She spoke to about 500 people from 15 states
attending a symposium on health career opportunities for Hispanics.
   The fact that she has been recommended for the job, Novello
said, sends a message that the Bush administration is interested in
recruiting minorities for powerful positions.
   ``It's an honor for me, and for being Hispanic and for being a
woman,'' she said at a news conference.
   Novello, who chairs the Pediatric Task Force for AIDS, said
health officials must obtain the ``true number'' of children
infected with the HIV virus. The HIV virus causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The task force estimates that by 1991, 10,000 to 20,000 children
will be infected with the virus, and 3,000 youngsters will have the
disease.
   ``However, it is feasible to believe that there are many more
children infected,'' she said, adding that not all infected
children have been tested.

   A young man panicked and buried a friend
in his parents' back yard after the friend died in his car, then
agonized for a week before telling his mother, police said Monday.
   An autopsy was conducted on the body of Alan Istvan, 28, of New
Fairfield, Conn., said Suffolk County police Lt. John Gierasch.
   Gierasch said there would be no decision on whether to charge
Michael Montheard, a 24-year-old house painter from Danbury, Conn.,
until Montheard had been interviewed and autopsy results were in.
   ``So far everything he has told us seems to be holding up,''
Gierasch said.
   The death and burial came to light Sunday night, when Montheard
telephoned his mother, Virginia Eckstein, said the family attorney,
John Byrnes. Montheard told her he had buried Istvan in her back
yard in this Long Island city of about 15,000 people 65 miles east
of New York City.
   The police were notified and they found Istvan's body in a
3-foot-deep grave covered with leaves behind the Eckstein home.
   According to Byrnes, Istvan fell asleep in Montheard's car when
they went out with another friend after work Oct. 13. Montheard and
the other friend left Istvan alone in the car for a little while,
Byrnes said. When they returned, they found him dead.
   ``He apparently had vomited and became asphyxiated on his own
vomit,'' Byrnes said.
   Montheard and the friend, who has not been identified by Byrnes
or police, threw a blanket over Istvan's body, drove to Long Island
early the next morning, and buried it in his mother and
stepfather's yard.
   If Montheard's story holds up, the only charge he could possibly
face would be unlawful disposal of a body, a misdemeanor violation
of state health law, Gierasch said.

<TEXT>
   ``Every time I kiss my wife and little
boy goodbye, I hold them a little longer and little tighter,'' a
reporter says.
   In the last eight years, 45 employees of Colombia's news media
have been murdered, eight since the government war on cocaine
cartels began nine weeks ago. Drug gangs have blown up two
newspapers and tried to bomb two radio stations.
   Every day, in print and on the air, the traffickers are faced
with tough editorials and reports of police or army raids on their
ranches, arrests, destruction of cocaine labs and, by their side,
assassinations and bombings.
   In the forefront of the battle has been the 102-year-old Bogota
daily El Espectador, whose publisher, Guillermo Cano, was killed by
the drug lords two years ago.
   The paper called Colombia's congress a pack of cowards this
month because some members favored negotiations with the
traffickers and opposed extraditing Colombians to face narcotics
charges in the United States.
   A car bomb exploded outside the paper's office Sept. 2, causing
$2.5 million in damage and nearly causing it to close.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, brother of the slain publisher, said last
week newspapers in the United States and other countries had
offered $1 million in aid.
   He said El Espectador would not take gifts, but would accept the
money as a 15-year loan free of interest.
   Drug traffickers realize murder and bombing won't silence El
Espectador, and they have begun threatening advertisers, Cano said,
causing a decline in advertising volume of 25-30 percent.
   ``The threats keep coming by telephone,'' he said, and many of
El Espectador's 1,200 workers say they have been threatened with
death.
   Gunmen on a motorcycle killed two employes Oct. 10 in Medellin,
base of the most notorious cartel. The paper closed its Medellin
offices and Cano said distribution there became impossible because
of threats to delivery boys, drivers of delivery trucks and even
newsstands.
   ``It unnerves me every time I hear a motorcycle come up behind
me,'' an El Espectador columnist said.
   Assassins riding double on motorcycles are a favorite weapon of
the traffickers, but one El Espectador reporter was killed by
gunmen who burst into his home, and a radio reporter was shot down
by killers waiting in shadows outside his house.
   Vanguardia Liberal, a newspaper in the northwestern city of
Bucaramanga, also has been a target. A car bomb exploded outside
its plant Oct. 16, destroying 80 percent of the facilities and
killing four people.
   It published a slim edition the next day, including news of the
drug war.
   Executive editor Enrique Santos of the Bogota daily El Tiempo,
the main competitor of El Espectador, said: ``I'm afraid there will
be dark days for another two years. Never in the history of
Colombia has there been such a dangerous and grave threat as the
press is suffering through now.''
   Santos worked for El Tiempo when its plant and El Espectador's
were burned in 1948, at the beginning of a civil war that lasted
seven years and took 250,000 lives.
   A military dictator seized both papers in 1955 when they refused
to submit material to military censors or stop publishing stories
about demonstrations agaist the regime.
   Of the threat from drug traffickers, Santos said: ``It is awful,
not knowing where the enemy is. No one knows when, how or where
they might strike.''
   El Tiempo, yet to be attacked, carries front-page stories daily
about the anti-drug war and has published editorials encouraging
the government.
   At least eight leading journalists have left the country because
of threats from the traffickers.
   Among them are two University of Kansas graduates associated
with El Tiempo _ part-owner Daniel Samper Pizano, who led the
investigative reporting team, and managing editor Rafael Santos,
son of publisher Hernando Santos.
   Others who have left are Fabio Castillo and Antonio Caballero of
El Espectador; Alberto Aguire of the Medellin daily El Mundo; Ligia
Riveros of the weekly news magazine Cromos; Mauricio Gomez,
director of the TV news program ``24 Hours,'' and Cesar Fernandez,
director of the program ``7 o'clock News.''
   Many who remain tell of looking over their shoulders constantly
while walking on the street, keeping an eye on the rear view mirror
while driving, in case a motorcycle approaches, and wondering
whether someone is waiting when they arrive home.
   Some threats are telephoned to wives.
   A U.S. reporter's wife said she and her 10-year-old son have
been threatened several times and she worries every day _
especially if the school bus bringing him home is a bit late,
because three schools have been bombed.
   She does not let her son play outside, movies are out because a
bomb went off in a theater, and there have been no trips to
shopping centers since a car bomb was found and defused outside the
city's largest one.
   The family stocks up on groceries to reduce the number of trips
to supermarkets, several of which have been bombed. They gave up
eating out because a bomb wrecked a restaurant, and fear of the
darkened streets in Bogota, a city of 6 million people, has nearly
ended their social life.
   ``I hear a motorcycle or a car slowing down as it goes by the
house and I wonder if this is it,'' the reporter's wife said.
   Since the crackdown began, 164 bombs have killed 16 people and
wounded 195.
   ``I think about how easy it would be to throw one through our
windows,'' she said.

<HEAD>Abortion Bill Veto Keeps Issue Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's veto of a bill expanding
federally financed abortions promises to keep alive an emotional
issue Republican candidates suddenly wish would fade away before
this fall's off-year elections.
   In races for governor of Virginia and New Jersey and for mayor
of New York City, Republican candidates are doing their best to
keep the debate away from abortion, an issue that now appears to be
helping their Democratic opponents.
   ``There's no question this is going to hurt the Republican
Party,'' Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., said after Bush's veto
Saturday.
   ``The issue is very much alive in the country. This is an issue
that threatens to divide the Reagan coalition,'' added Republican
consultant Roger Stone.
   Lawmakers and lobbyists who back abortion rights see little hope
of overriding the veto, but they say they will mount an effort in
the House anyway.
   ``Clearly we'll try to override. Clearly, that's probably not
going to happen, so he wins,'' a disheartened Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., said after Saturday's veto.
   The abortion funding expansion was attached to a $157 billion
spending bill. Packwood said on Cable News Network's ``Evans &amp;
Novak'' show that if the override fails, lawmakers should pass the
spending bill again and send it back to Bush.
   The bill Bush vetoed Saturday had passed the Senate by a
decisive 67-31 margin, but it squeaked through the House 216-206,
far short of the two-thirds vote necessary for an override.
   The measure, which Congress sent to Bush last week despite his
pledge to veto it, would permit poor women who are victims of rape
and incest to obtain abortions paid by Medicaid.
   That covers a relatively small group, by most estimates. Yet its
passage, and Bush's public anguish before announcing his veto
plans, have given it broader symbolic importance while compounding
difficulty for right-to-life candidates who find polls shifting
against them.
   In New Jersey, Republican James Courter has been accused of
waffling on abortion and trails Democrat James Florio. Courter has
tried to push the campaign onto the issues of crime, drugs, taxes
and automobile insurance.
   ``We would prefer the race to be fought on other, traditional
issues,'' says Kenneth Connolly, Courter's campaign manager.
   In Virginia, Marshall Coleman won the Republican primary with a
tough anti-abortion position but has been pounded for that position
by Democrat Douglas Wilder, who reversed a deficit in published
polls while his abortion-rights ads were running.
   Coleman responded by attacking Wilder's character and past
record on crime.
   ``It's our responsibility to get another issue out there, and
that's what you'll see from Coleman,'' said Michele Davis, director
of the Republican Governors' Association.
   ``We have to demonstrate very clearly that abortion is an issue
but it is not the only issue,'' adds Bruce Hildebrand, Coleman's
press secretary.
   National Republican strategists acknowledge privately, however,
that the abortion issue is proving a problem for some of their
candidates who have staked out firm anti-abortion stands.
   While that once seemed a safe political position, polls show
Republican candidates are losing some voters because of the
abortion issue _ primarily younger voters and women.
   The equation changed with the Supreme Court's decision last
summer giving states more room to regulate abortions. That gave the
issue increased relevance and raised the prospect in voters' minds
that abortion rights could be restricted.
   ``In order to retrieve the Republican female vote, which we are
losing, we have to focus on other issues that voters care about _
like child care, the environment,'' said one Republican strategist,
who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   These Republicans hope that Bush's veto on the Medicaid abortion
bill won't be seen by most voters in state and congressional races
as directly relevant to the question of maintaining abortion rights.
   But they acknowledge that to the extent Bush's veto keeps public
attention focused on abortion, it can impede their candidates'
efforts to move the public debate to other issues.

   The Monitor, the ironclad Civil War ship that
sank in a gale after a celebrated battle with the Confederate ship
Merrimack 127 years ago, still finds itself surrounded by
turbulence.
   The government's refusal for safety reasons to allow anyone to
dive to the ironclad Monitor's watery grave for the last 10 years
has angered divers, who believe the ship is on the verge of
collapsing.
   If that happens, it will be the end of part of our ``national
heritage,'' a divers' lobbying group said last week. ``Underlying
this controversy is how far the government should go to protect the
individual from undertaking a somewhat dangerous activity,'' said
the International Scuba Association.
   Photographing the Monitor has become an obsession for marine
explorer Gary Gentile, 43, of Philadelphia, who has enlisted the
aid of his congressman and fellow scuba enthusiasts to help him get
permission for the dive.
   In the last five years, Gentile said he has filed 11 permit
applications and written 51 letters to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the wreck 16 miles off
the Cape Hatteras coast in North Carolina.
   Gentile, who said his quest has cost him thousands of dollars,
has begun filing federal Freedom of Information Act requests to try
to obtain information from NOAA that he believes will not be
forthcoming any other way.
   Last week he sat through a daylong hearing before a NOAA
administrative law judge who considered previous denials of three
of his requests _ each varying slightly _ to make the 220-foot dive
using scuba gear. The judge will study the case further before
making a recommendation to the National Ocean Service, a branch of
NOAA.
   ``The problem is bureaucratic territoriality,'' Gentile said in
an interview after the hearing. ``NOAA wants to preserve the wreck
for themselves.''
   The currents and weather can change quickly in the area where
the Monitor went down.
   ``They don't call that `The Graveyard of the Atlantic' for
nothing,'' said NOAA spokesman Dane Konop, who has been to the
site. ``It's a very tricky situation out there, the most dangerous
conditions imaginable.''
   Gentile's attorney, fellow diver Peter Hess, noted at the
hearing that NOAA allowed French explorer Jacques Cousteau's party
to dive to the Monitor in 1979.
   Cousteau Society spokeswoman Karen Brazeau said last week that
the weather and the visibility on the trip was poor, and that
little or no usable footage was produced.
   ``No one has dove on that site since,'' Konop said. ``You can
say NOAA learned its lesson from the Cousteau dive. They were happy
to make it back aboard safely.''
   NOAA now considers the dive too deep and dangerous to be made
using the compressed air that Cousteau's group used and that
Gentile proposes, Konop said. At certain depths, nitrogen in the
air can cause divers to lose concentration or impede motor skills.
   But Gentile said he has made many deeper dives on scuba,
including 24 expeditions to the 33-year-old wreck of the Andrea
Doria, off Nantucket Island in Massachusetts.
   Gentile has now applied to make the dive using a mixture of
oxygen and helium, a combination that is more expensive than
compressed air but which he hopes NOAA will find more acceptable.
That request is still pending.
   ``Anyone who has put this much blood and sweat into it, it would
be terrific if he could meet NOAA's conditions,'' said Peter
DeCoursey, spokesman for Rep. Robert Borski, D-Pa., who has been
trying to speed up the administration's consideration of Gentile's
requests.
   A Union ship, the 172-foot Monitor was built with iron. Both the
Monitor and the Merrimack survived their famous battle in 1862, but
neither stayed around long.
   The Monitor sank in bad weather, and the Merrimack, renamed the
Virginia, was destroyed by its crew to keep it from being captured
by the Union.
   In 1987, Konop and other NOAA officials journeyed to the Monitor
site and returned with photographs and measurements obtained from a
remote device they sent into the water. Based partly on NOAA's own
statements, Gentile and his attorney said they fear the ship is
collapsing.
   Konop conceded the ship's situation is ``dynamic,'' but said,
``I've never seen anything from us that says it's in imminent
danger of collapsing on itself.''
   Gentile said he wants to capture the ship on film from an
artist's perspective.
   ``NOAA got a fantastic amount of information, but there's no
human interest in it. I want something people can relate to. It
should be photographed before it collapses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumer Food Prices May Moderate in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No flat predictions yet, but one of the
Agriculture Department's chief grocery-watchers thinks consumer
food prices in 1990 won't go up as fast as they did this year.
   Food prices did rise sharply in 1989, an average of ``around 6
percent'' over the calendar year, economist Ralph L. Parlett Jr.
says, adding that not much is in the works over the next couple of
months that will alter that preliminary reading.
   According to USDA records based on official Labor Department
statistics, this year's 6 percent all-food increase _ which
includes meals eaten out as well as at home _ is the biggest gain
since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981.
   Retail food prices averaged 4.1 percent higher in each of the
last two years and had hovered at or below that level since the
hefty 1981 increase.
   Parlett, interviewed by telephone last Friday, said he was in
the midst of preparing the 1990 forecast for release at the
department's annual outlook conference in late November.
   ``I don't think there'll be the increase we've seen this year,''
Parlett ventured. ``It's not going to be near the 6 percent level
... I don't think.''
   Although Parlett said the 1990 food outlook is still a bit
cloudy, there are some points that can be made about this year's
situation and how those might bear on the immediate future.
   ``Some of our price increase this year was caused early on by
bad weather, with vegetables, particularly,'' he said. ``We don't
forecast bad weather for 1990, so maybe that's one thing that won't
happen, hopefully.''
   Parlett added: ``But we still have the carryover from the (1988)
drought that left a lot of pipelines empty, in terms of the
processed vegetable market. Prices will be high, and supplies are
still going to be tight.''
   Despite ``a respectable harvest'' of vegetables this year,
supplies for processing will be tight as inventories continue to be
replenished, he said. But this will gradually be corrected.
   ``Come next year there's no reason to see those vegetable prices
_ processed or fresh _ to be screaming higher,'' Parlett said.
   Meat, poultry, fish and eggs account for more than 30 percent of
the Labor Department's food-at-home price index, based on December
1988 computations.
   By comparison, cereals and bakery products are about 14 percent
of the index; dairy products, 12 percent; fresh fruits and
vegetables, 11 percent; and processed fruits and vegetables, 7
percent.
   ``The big story really is in poultry,'' Parlett said. ``Demand
for poultry isn't going to change considerably, but (producers)
have continued to increase production. So, I would expect some
decrease in poultry prices. We've already seen them start coming
down from June.''
   Red meat supplies, mostly beef and pork, probably will decrease
slightly in 1990, he said. But there is uncertainty about what will
happen to prices, partly because poultry has an impact on beef and
pork, and vice versa.
   Last week Parlett's agency, the Economic Research Service, said
that the farm price of milk has risen sharply this year, meaning
that consumers will also see ``brisk'' increases, including cheese
and non-fat dry milk.
   ``For the first time in many years, rises in retail dairy prices
will surpass those of all-food or all (consumer) items,'' the
report said.
   The National Milk Producers' Federation said that from 1975
until 1982, consumer prices for dairy products climbed at about the
same rate as milk prices. Since 1982, federal milk supports have
dropped more than 23 percent and ``farm milk prices also declined
over the same period of time,'' the federation said in a recent
newsletter.
   ``Consumers pay when farm milk prices go up, but they have not
reaped the expected benefits when farm prices decline,'' it said.
   The Labor Department's report last week noted that consumer food
prices overall rose a moderate 0.2 percent in September after
rising sharply earlier in the year. Food and beverage prices shot
up at a 9.3 percent annual rate through May, but from June to
September climbed at only a 1.7 percent rate.
   But the price index for dairy products rose faster than the
general tide, jumping 1.4 percent in September, the largest monthly
increase since May 1980.
   Parlett said USDA has been forecasting retail dairy prices
rising around 6 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent
increase in 1988 _ when overall food prices rose 4.1 percent.

   The American soldiers who invaded Grenada six
years ago are rightly hailed as heroes but the official U.S.
rationale for the mission was bogus, says a British officer
involved in the attack.
   Retired Maj. Mark Adkin says the U.S. military action was not
necessary to save the lives of American medical students on the
Caribbean island, as claimed by the Reagan administration, and in
fact endangered them.
   He also says U.S. soldiers succeeded despite weak advance
planning and haphazard coordination by leaders of the different
military services involved.
   Adkin, who took part in the invasion as Caribbean operations
staff officer for the Barbados Defense Force, recounts the mission
in a new book titled ``Urgent Fury: The Battle for Grenada.''
   He lauds the outcome of the invasion, which occurred six years
ago this week, and says it prevented Grenada from becoming a
``communist bastion'' in the region. But he dismisses U.S. claims
at the time that the 700 American medical students on the island
were in danger of being taken hostage.
   Then-President Reagan repeatedly said the 6,000 combat troops
staged a ``rescue mission'' on Oct. 25, 1983, to prevent the
students from being taken hostage by a radical Marxist government.
   If anything, Adkin says, the invasion increased the chances that
the students would be taken hostage.
   ``U.S. citizens were in no danger until the operation was
launched,'' he writes. ``The assault on the island could easily
have precipitated the taking of hostages by desperate men driven to
desperate means to save their own lives.''
   The administration decided to intervene in Grenada ``on the
basis of seizing a fleeting strategic-political advantage, which
had the added merit that inevitable military success would raise
U.S. flagging morale,'' he says.
   The predawn attack by combined elite units of all the U.S. armed
forces came days after leftists on the island executed Marxist
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and imposed a 24-hour curfew. The
invasion forces ousted the leftists and flew the students home.
   A former Reagan administration official, Langhorne Anthony
Motley, disputes Adkin's claims about the students, saying: ``He's
totally incorrect.''
   Motley, a former assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said a CIA officer spoke with the students before the
troops arrived and ``they were concerned'' about being taken
hostage.
   Regardless of the reason for the mission, Adkin says, the U.S.
troops deserved the heroes' welcome they received from both the
islanders and the American public upon their return.
   ``The people who had been invaded welcomed the invaders,
regarded them as liberators, even going so far as to want U.S.
troops to remain far longer than they did. The island was to be a
communist bastion, an ever more menacing reminder to the rest of
the region that their way of live was threatened,'' he says.
   ``This is what it would have become. That it did not was because
President Reagan acted, albeit primarily for reasons of national
self-interest.''
   Nineteen American soldiers died in the initial assault and
several days of skirmishes. Adkin says two Army Rangers also died
when their parachutes failed to open.
   He argues that the American soldiers had to overcome a lack of
intelligence information on the island and poor preparation for the
joint operation.
   The U.S. military has done its own assessments on Grenada,
finding fault with the lack of coordination and intelligence. Many
details of those assessments remain classified, however.
   A retired U.S. military officer, who served in the planning and
execution of the Grenada invasion, acknowledged some problems but
said Adkin ``doesn't tell the whole story.''
   The officer, who spoke only on condition he not be further
identified, agreed that the troops operated without maps and
up-to-date intelligence information but said Adkin should have
noted that ``a lot of decisions were made on the ground by ground
commanders. They were able to adapt.''
   However, he agreed that the various armed forces were
ill-prepared to work together and said the decision to use a
combined force at that time was wrong.
   The Grenada operation later was cited by Sen. William Cohen,
D-Maine, as the main reason for a 1986 bill mandating a joint
special operations command.
   ``That it succeeded as it did, without costly setbacks, was due
primarily to incredibly good fortune,'' Adkin says.
   Still, he concludes that ``for all the errors, for all the
confusion, for all the suffering, Grenada and its people remain
grateful to those bold enough to launch the operation and those
bold enough to undertake it.''

<HEAD>Mapplethorpe Exhibit Draws Overflow Crowd</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An exhibit of sexually explicit
photographs that ignited a debate over government funding of the
arts got mixed reviews from an overflow crowd, as it was denounced
by a small band of protesters.
   The exhibit of photos by the late Robert Mapplethorpe opened
Saturday at the Wadsworth Atheneum. The collection includes photos
of homosexual acts as well as more conventional nudes, celebrity
portraits and still lifes of flowers.
   About 15 religious activists picketed, denouncing the exhibit as
``gay pornography,'' but the line of patrons extended out the door.
Officials said 2,000 people paid to see the show, more than four
times the usual Saturday attendance.
   ``The overall quality was superb,'' Kathy Cemino said as she
left the museum. ``There was really nothing obscene about it. The
flowers are really beautiful.''
   Conservatives in Congress, led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., were
angered to learn that the Mapplethorpe exhibit at Washington's
Corcoran Gallery of Art originally was funded in part by the
National Endowment for the Arts. Congress last month defeated a
Helms proposal to ban federal funding of art considered ``obscene''
or ``indecent.''
   Instead, Congress voted to bar government financing of works
that ``may be obscene'' and lack ``serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value'' _ the Supreme Court's 1973
guideline on obscenity.
   The exhibit had opened to large crowds and critical acclaim in
Chicago and Philadelphia before its stormy stop in Washington.
   Atheneum Director Patrick McCaughey said he was happy to show
the photos because an art museum ``mustn't just lie back and sit
like a tabby cat.'' He said the turnout challenged ``the outsider's
view of Hartford _ that it's the insurance capital, that it's
staid.''
   The Hartford museum charged a special $3 admission fee to offset
the cost of showing it and required that minors be accompanied by
an adult.
   Demonstrators carried signs that read, ``Promote True Art, Not
Obscenity,'' and ``Federally Funded Gay Pornography.''
   Mary Ann Pressamarita, who has helped defeat gay rights bills in
the Legislature and fought topless bars, said the exhibit contained
``a lot of beautiful pictures'' along with ``absolute pornography.''
   The protest drew a counter-demonstration from two men, who
embraced and kissed on the lips for several minutes in front of the
protesters.
   ``Oh my God!'' screamed one demonstrator. ``Are they crazy?''
   Inside, during a panel discussion, art critic Bernard Hanson
defended the artist, telling an audience of about 300 that the
photos contain nothing new.
   ``Those of you who have squinted hard at the dirty Greek vases
in the Vatican know what I'm talking about,'' he said. ``What is
the big deal?''

   Rescuers euphoric over finding a survivor
in a collapsed freeway had to suspend their search late Sunday
because the rubble became so unstable, and earthquake-shaken
Northern Californians mapped strategy for Monday's commute through
``gridlock.''
   Authorities sent crews home for the night because so much
further damage had been done by aftershocks and heavy construction
equipment that they had no idea how to safely shore up Interstate
880. Large sections of concrete have crumbled. And there was no
estimate of when work could resume.
   ``It's kind of minute by minute,'' said California Department of
Transportation spokesman Kyle Nelson said.
   More than 100 people were evacuated Sunday afternoon from an
Oakland housing project located within 10 feet of a four-block
stretch of I-880 abutting the portion that gave way in the quake.
   The evacuation came after a cement column fell from the
structure and new cracks were discovered in the section of
double-deck freeway that had previously been thought to be stable.
   Longshoreman Buck Helm, who spent four days in a tomb of I-880
concrete and steel, was in critical-stable condition at Highland
General Hospital in Oakland with some slight improvement, hospital
officials said.
   Engineer Steven Whipple, hailed as a hero of the rescue, said he
was checking the fallen double-deck freeway for stability on
Saturday when he spotted the back of Helm's head with his
flashlight, and then saw a hand wave at him.
   ``It stopped my heart. I thought maybe the wind was blowing and
that's what caused it. I thought I might be losing it,'' said
Whipple, 29.
   The number of dead pulled from the I-880 disaster rose to 38,
including a 4-year-old boy, bringing the earthquake's toll to 59,
with thousands injured and homeless and dozens still missing.
   ``We know there are more victims, more cars. But we don't know
how many,'' said California Highway Patrol Capt. Mike Garver.
   Damage estimates topped $7 billion, making the quake the
costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, according to the
Independent Insurance Agents of America.
   Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent announced Sunday that the
World Series would not resume until Friday night, three days later
than originally hoped. The championship between the Oakland A's and
the San Francisco Giants was suspended the night of the quake.
   Sunday was a day for both mourning the dead and giving thanks
for the living at churches across the Bay area.
   Special services were set because some damaged churches remain
too dangerous, and congregants praying for peace with the Earth
were encouraged to share their quake experiences.
   ``By the uncertainties of this hour, we pray to be spared from
further suffering,'' Archbishop John R. Quinn told 700 people at
St. Mary's Cathedral here.
   ``We pray that we may be spared further earthquakes,'' Quinn
said. ``We pray for all those who have suffered heavy losses. I
weep for the parents, for the elderly, for the children. I pray for
the relief of suffering and anxiety. I cannot forget to pray for
the dead and the bereaved.''
   In Oakland, parishioners of the St. Francis de Salles Cathedral
had to move services to a Baptist church because the cathedral's
tower was filled with cracks and leaning precariously.
   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, `Pay attention,
there is something more important than the ordinary things in your
life,''' Father Joseph M. Powers said.
   ``It wasn't just the ground that shook Tuesday, the earthquake
shook a lot of things that we do _ the ordinary things on our
agenda,'' Powers said.
   Phone calls, telegrams and bouquets of flowers for Helm, the
burly longshoreman, deluged Highland General Hospital Sunday.
   Helm regained some function in his kidneys, damaged by severe
dehydration, and his lung condition improved slightly, Dr. Will Fry
said. He was still in the intensive care unit being fed through a
tube, and still was having difficulty moving his left leg.
   ``He is not out of the woods yet,'' Fry said.
   A non-smoker, Helm had high blood pressure and mild diabetes
that did not require insulin before the earthquake.
   ``I think it's more amazing that he has been able to come
through as well as he has despite those medical problems,'' Fry
said. ``He's proven that he has a strong will to live.''
   Crews sawed the fallen five-lane section of the upper deck of
the Bay Bridge in half and lifted one section down to a barge for
repairs Sunday.
   A barge floating on chopping San Francisco Bay is supporting a
towering white crane capable of lifting the 100-ton separate
sections of roadway that collapsed in the earthquake, killing a
woman who drove her car into the gap. The vital link between San
Francisco and Oakland is expected to be closed for four weeks.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday reported major cracks
in three dams within 5 miles of the epicenter _ Lexington, Newell
Creek and Lake Elsman _ but said they posed ``no public threat at
this time'' because water is low behind them.
   At the I-880 rescue site in industrial downtown Oakland, six
sweeps of the area where Helm was found with sniffing dogs and
electronic gear turned up no signs of other survivors.
   Digging to remove cars and bodies was delayed because the
double-deck freeway, which collapsed on top of itself, shifted
under the strains of aftershocks, wind and even the rescue work
itself.
   Workers placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and wood timbers
under concrete sections, and used truckloads of dirt to build a
sturdier foundation, according to Kyle Nelson, a California
Department of Transportation spokesman in Oakland.
   They also installed seismic monitors on the structure.
   ``The problem is we still have to proceed cautiously and
deliberately even though people are encouraged,'' said Jim Drago,
another CalTrans spokesman.
   Despite the slow pace, rescue workers still had a renewed vigor
Sunday.
   ``We need to use every trick in the rescue books to make sure no
one's still up here alive,'' said Bill Bromely, a construction
worker moving debris. ``We know now that it's possible. We're going
as fast as we can.''
   A half-dozen impromptu tent cities have sprouted up around
Watsonville, the battered, largely Hispanic city south of San
Francisco and closer to the epicenter.
   Hundreds of residents there are so traumatized by the quake, its
aftershocks, which have been both strong and numerous, and the
memory of the Mexico City earthquake that they refuse to go indoors.
   ``This place is a disaster,'' Pamela Cote, of the Santa Cruz
County human resources agency, said as she tried to coax 50
survivors living in Calaghan Park to move to 22 Army tents erected
several blocks away by the National Guard.
   ``People are everywhere on the streets in this town.''
   The Red Cross opened a permanent tent shelter with large
olive-colored military tents in a Watsonville park Sunday.
   Throughout the quake area, the Red Cross said, the population at
its 19 shelters dropped to 2,000 Saturday night. It had been above
10,000.
   In the Bay area, officials were doing everything they could to
scare commuters off the streets Monday, the first work day for tens
of thousands since Tuesday's quake.
   Numerous freeways remain closed in addition to the Bay Bridge.
An armada of ferries has formed, and transit authorities touted
subways and buses as well.
   Employers were offering flexible work schedules, but with many
routes into the Bay area and Silicon Valley blocked, the Monday
morning forecast called for ``gridlock.''
   Driving to work alone amounts to ``an anti-social act,'' said
Rod Diridon, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

   Two days and nights of storms in Britain left 13
people dead in extreme weather conditions on the roads and at sea,
all in southern England, the police and coast guard reported today.
   In the worst incident, an empty bus skidding on a wet road at
Honiton, Devon, hit a railroad bridge and landed upside down on a
car, killing the bus driver and the car's four occupants, who were
going home from a wedding.
   Five other people died in road accidents caused by vehicles
skidding or crashing into trees brought down by the winds.
   Two men died in separate yacht capsizings off the south coast
and a youth was swept away while fishing off rocks near Perranporth
in Cornwall.
   Thousands of homes in southern England were left without power
on Saturday when power lines were brought down.
   Meteorologists said the bad weather that began Friday night was
the worst since a hurricane swept southern England in October 1987,
leaving 17 people dead and felling an estimated 15 million trees.

   The average price of gasoline nationwide
dipped about a half-cent a gallon at the pumps in the past two
weeks, a survey found.
   The Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gas stations showed the average
retail price of all grades of gasoline, including taxes, at 109.12
cents a gallon on Friday, down .53 cent from Oct. 6, analyst Trilby
Lundberg said Sunday.
   ``The movement is not untypical for this type of year. It's
partially a response to seasonally lowered demand, but also to
ample supplies,'' she said.
   Wholesale prices fell, allowing retailers to pass their savings
on to customers, she said.
   According to the survey, self-service prices per gallon were:
regular unleaded, 97.74 cents; premium unleaded, 114.87 cents;
regular leaded, 96.62 cents.
   At full-service pumps, prices per gallon were: regular unleaded,
127.26; premium unleaded, 139.92 cents; regular leaded, 126.01
cents.

   Leta Frye recently joined the ranks of
the nation's homeless.
   She's not a disheveled bag lady with possessions stashed in a
supermarket shopping cart. Mrs. Frye's belongings are strewn on a
slope in the Santa Cruz Mountains, mixed up with the debris of her
earthquake-ravaged $450,000 house.
   The split-level, four-bedroom home is now a splintered pile of
rubble, rocked off its foundation and tossed 15 feet by the 6.9
magnitude San Francisco Bay area earthquake. Only three huge pine
trees prevent the wreckage from sliding down the mountain.
   ``I realize I'm in a different subset of the population now.
Suddenly, I'm a homeless person,'' the 54-year-old dietitian said
Sunday, as she and her husband, William, picked through the debris.
``I slept in my car for two nights. I have a different frame of
mind now.''
   ``It's kind of like a death in the family,'' Aetna Casualty and
Life Insurance Co. spokesman Tom Greaney said of the loss.
   Aetna adjuster Toni Johnson said the Frye home was the worst she
had seen so far, adding that it would take weeks to determine how
many homes in the Bay area were destroyed in the quake.
   ``There are just too many to count,'' she said.
   The Fryes were paid $20,000 on Friday as an advance to their
earthquake insurance claim. The couple had argued a year ago over
whether to buy insurance and reluctantly paid the $440-a-year
premium.
   ``We really debated about it before we signed up. Thank God we
did,'' said Mrs. Frye.
   The couple bought the 22-year-old house five years ago. It's one
of 112 houses in the Villa del Monte Estates area about 50 miles
south of San Francisco and just southwest of San Jose.
   ``Many people have come by here and said we have the dubious
distinction of having the most destroyed house in the Villa,'' Mrs.
Frye said.
   ``We've become very popular,'' added Frye.
   The contents of dressers, cupboards, drawers and desks where
strewn about inside the demolished home, and the Fryes used a
garden rake to fish out mementos and personal items in reach.
   ``I think everybody around here for two days was on this numb
high _ sort of in shock,'' Mrs. Frye said.
   When the earthquake struck, Mrs. Frye was driving home in her
car and thought the tires had gone flat. Her husband, 57, an
executive at Lockheed Space Ordnance, was in Maryland on a business
trip.
   ``His first comment was, `Well, Leta, you wanted to remodel,' ''
Mrs. Frye said. ``We had one room we called the T.U.R. _ the
torn-up room, which I was going to remodel. Now I call it the
T.U.H. _ torn-up house.''
   The Fryes, who now are staying in a hotel, say they are
uncertain whether they will rebuild on the one-acre site.
   The 27,750 people living in Los Gatos were still coping Sunday
with effects of the quake. Traffic lights were still out, plywood
covered many storefront windows, roadblocks remained in the heart
of town, and state Highway 17 leading south through the mountains
to Santa Cruz was still closed. A steady procession of trucks
carried water into the mountains.
   The heavily wooded area features a phenomenon unusual in
California _ noticeable seasons. Fall leaves have turned orange and
have filled the four-inch cracks on the mountain roads throught the
region.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Taking Taxpayer-Funded Trip to Jamaica</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., is
inviting more than 100 colleagues on a taxpayer-financed trip to
Jamaica's Montego Bay next month, and he's apparently getting quite
a response.
   The trip, scheduled for Nov. 2-6 and intended to explore
Caribbean development issues, has attracted so much interest that
aides said they may not be able to accommodate everyone.
   By the time the Air Force jet leaves, however, aides expect no
more than 20 House members plus some spouses and staffers to be on
board. By Friday, the State Department, which handles travel
arrangements for congressional delegations going overseas, said it
only had the names of six people who were going.
   Crockett, chairman of the House subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere Affairs, did not respond to calls about the trip Friday.
   His office refused to release a copy of the invitation he sent
to as many as 150 House members, or a list of people who planned to
attend the long weekend event at Montego Bay's Half Moon Club.
   Victor Johnson, the staff director, said a final list of
participants probably would not be available until takeoff.
   The purpose of the trip is to try to get lawmakers in touch with
a wide variety of people, including academics, union heads and
farmers' and labor organizations, Johnson said.
   Steve Hellinger, co-director of the Development Group for
Alternative Policies Inc., a non-profit group that is sponsoring
the event, said the seminars and meetings are hard work. The
conference should not be considered play even though it is held at
a resort, he said.
   Atherton Martin, who works with Hellinger, said a number of
members of Congress had expressed interest in the trip, but his
group had ``been asked not to release names, given the whole things
with junkets and ethics.''
   The group provided an agenda for the five-day program.
   After arriving Nov. 2, participants are invited to a reception.
A series of speeches and conferences are scheduled for the next two
days, generally running from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   Sunday is a free day for recreation. On the final day, lawmakers
will receive a briefing from the U.S. Embassy staff before flying
back to Washington.
   The lawmakers will hear from Crockett and Michael Manley,
Jamaica's prime minister, before the seminars start.
   Topics include: ``Narcotics: Toward a new Understanding,'' a
panel discussion on ``Structural Adjustment and Debt,'' an open
discussion on ``Internal Constraints,'' and a presentation on
``Options and Strategies: Regional Development, Food Security and
the Role of Regional Institutions.''
   The Jamaica conference is an outgrowth of two earlier
conferences on Barbados attended by members of Congress. Rep. Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee
with responsibility for approving members' trips, attended the
Barbados conference in February 1988.
   But Barbara Burris, Fascell's spokeswoman, said her boss would
not travel to Jamaica this year. Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who also
traveled to Barbados, declined the trip because of the upcoming New
York mayoral race, according to his assistant, Miles Lackey.
   Among those who intend on taking the trip are Rep. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn., and Jaime Fuster, Puerto Rico's delegate in Congress,
their aides said.
   Frenzel is a member of the House Ways and Means' subcommittee on
trade, which had jurisdiction over the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
a stalled U.S. development plan for the region. He is also a
co-chairman of Friends of the Caribbean, a loosely knit task force
on the region.
   Both groups, as well as the subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere, are expected to send members to Jamaica.
   Martin said the results of the Barbados conference have already
borne fruit: Crockett introduced a $93 million Caribbean aid
package which has passed the House and is pending in the Senate.
   Although the U.S. government picks up the cost of travel and
pays a per diem for members of Congress, the Development GAP raised
money for the conference, Hellinger said. Sources include
foundations, like the Carnegie Corp., and private contributions
from grassroots groups, such as churches, he said.

   Author James Michener helped open a new
art museum with advice for politicans: Let private individuals buy
public art.
   Michener said Sunday at the new Berman Museum of Art at Ursinus
College that elected officials ``don't know what they're doing.
They are terribly vulnerable to public opinion and it is unfair to
saddle them with decisions which it takes even a brilliant
connoisseur years to develop.''
   ``The collection of great art must be left to private
individuals, and then, structure society so that later on they will
give it to the public,'' said Michener, the author of such
best-selling novels as ``Tales of South Pacific,'' ``Hawaii,''
``Space'' and ``Centennial.''
   The author has a home in Bucks County.
   The Berman Museum was named for Philip I. and Muriel M. Berman
of Allentown, who contributed 1,500 art works from their
collection. Berman is the former owner of the Hess' department
store chain.
   The opening exhibit features art by Edgar Degas, Rembrandt
Peale, Marc Chagall, John Singer Sargeant and Edward Hopper.

   Singer Carly Simon says she is writing a novel
based on her life after coming out with a children's book that
stems from hundreds of nights of storytelling.
   Simon recalled making up bedtime stories for her son and
daughter, now ages 12 and 15, when they were very young.
   ``Eventually it became that the kids would want to bypass the
books and they'd say, `Oh Mom, tell that story again about Amy, the
bear that danced.' Or the story about Wiwac, the little girl who
had a speech impediment and couldn't say her real name, which is
Lilac,'' she said.
   ``And these stories came out of my head with no effort, because,
after all, my audience was so loving and so receptive. So anything
could emerge,'' she said in Sunday's Daily News Magazine.
   The stories were turned into a children's book, ``Amy the
Dancing Bear,'' published recently by Doubleday. Simon has a
contract to write more children's books in the future.
   She's also turning her attention to a longer work after Jackie
Onassis, her editor at Doubleday, made the suggestion. ``That's how
I originally got with Jackie,'' said Simon. ``She said, `I've got
the feeling you could write a book.'''

   A golfing foursome featuring Vice
President Dan Quayle, Gov. Bob Martinez, and NBC's ``Today'' show
host Bryant Gumbel won't be bragging about their game, but their
shots did help a fund-raiser.
   The three appeared Sunday in a charity pro-am tournament that
helped raise $200,000 for the United Negro College Fund.
   Rounding out the Quayle-Martinez-Gumbel foursome was the vice
president's former college roommate and golfing buddy, NBC-TV
sports commentator Mark Rolfing. They combined to shoot 249, far

   Zsa Zsa Gabor's infamous Rolls-Royce isn't as
infamous as she hoped.
   The Hungarian actress offered the white 1980 Corniche
convertible up for sale over the weekend at an auction. Her minimum
asking price was $125,000, but the high bid came in at $105,000.
   To that, Miss Gabor said no, and drove off.
   The actress was driving the vehicle when she was pulled over by
Beverly Hills police Officer Paul Kramer last June. She is to be
sentenced Tuesday on her misdemeanor convictions of slapping
Kramer, driving without a valid license and carrying an open
container of liquor in her car.
   Miss Gabor said she had not intended to sell the Rolls, but was
talked into it Saturday when she and her husband visited the
auction at a hotel in Woodland Hills where another Rolls-Royce they
owned went for $80,000.
   Sold at the auction for $75,000 was a heavily customized,
metallic red Jaguar XJS that had earned its owner, outfielder Jose
Canseco of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, a string of
speeding tickets.

   Jim Bakker says God has forgiven him for
his sins, but his lawyer is afraid the TV evangelist will have a
tougher time setting things straight with a no-nonsense federal
judge they call ``Maximum Bob.''
   Bakker could be sent to prison for 120 years and fined more than
$5.2 million when he goes before U.S. District Judge Robert Potter
on Tuesday for sentencing for fraud and conspiracy.
   ``Maximum Bob will probably knock a year off the maximum,''
defense attorney George Davis joked ruefully.
   The judge lived up to his moniker last month when he sentenced
former Bakker aide David Taggart to 18 years and five months in
prison for tax evasion.
   ``One can only speculate Jim will get a heavier sentence than
Taggart _ it's a foregone conclusion,'' Davis said in an interview.
Taggart also was fined $500,000.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said prosecutors will ask
for a prison sentence, but he refused to elaborate.
   Miller also declined to say if the government will ask that
Bakker be taken into custody immediately after sentencing;
prosecutors unsuccessfully tried to jail him after his conviction.
   Bakker, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 on 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy for overselling $158 million in lifetime vacations, or
``partnerships,'' at PTL's resort hotels. The jury found that
Bakker used more than $3.7 million to buy luxurious homes, fancy
cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.
   The six-week trial was briefly interrupted by Bakker's
commitment to a mental hospital after a breakdown.
   ``God has forgiven me for my sins,'' he told followers from the
pulpit last week at his New Covenant Church in Orlando, Fla. ``I'm
not guilty.''
   Taggart and his brother, James, were convicted of diverting more
than $1.1 milion in PTL money for their own use and cheating the
government out of $525,000 in taxes.
   James Taggart drew the maximum prison term _ 17 years and nine
months _ and was fined $500,000. Both Taggarts testified against
Bakker.
   Potter, a Reagan appointee on the bench for eight years, ``can
be harsh when it's called for, compassionate when it's justified,''
Charlotte lawyer George Laughrun said last month.
   If a defendant admits his guilt, Potter is likely to weigh that
in his favor, Laughrun said. If Potter thinks a defendant is lying,
he's likely to hold that against him, the lawyer said.
   Before sentencing the Taggarts, Potter said he thought they had
lied on the stand. But Potter gave former PTL executive Richard
Dortch eight years out of a possible 10 after Dortch pleaded
guilty, apologized and agreed to testify for the government.

   A centuries-old tradition of opium
poppy cultivation in Pakistan and Afghanistan has blossomed into a
major heroin industry during a decade of political turmoil in
Southwest Asia.
   It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a ``heroin and
Kalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferred
automatic weapon of the region's drug lords.
   Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboring
Afghanistan, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attempt
to control their cultivation.
   Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined into
heroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged
Pakistan-Afghan frontier. It is then spirited through Pakistan to
markets in the United States and Europe.
   Western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of the
heroin sold in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United States
comes from the so-called ``Golden Crescent'' region of Southwest
Asia.
   The remainder comes from Mexico and Southeast Asia's ``Golden
Triangle,'' U.S. sources say.
   Pakistani officials say it's hard to estimate how much of the
drug passes through their country. Khalim Dilkhan, chairman of the
Pakistan Narcotics Control Board, said that in 1988 alone local
agents seized 13,670 pounds of heroin, compared with 950 pounds
seized in 1980.
   He said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in this Moslem
country of 109 million people 10 years ago but now more than one
million mostly poor, urban Pakistanis are hooked.
   Their preferred method of using the drug is to smoke it, whereas
most addicts in the West inject heroin.
   ``In 10 years, the problem has multiplied a thousand times,''
Dilkhan said.
   There are no statistics on addicts in Afghanistan.
   Poppy cultivation has declined steadily in Pakistan, but it has
risen sharply in Afghanistan, where fighting between the Marxist
government and Moslem rebels has turned tribal areas along the
mountainous Afghan-Pakistan frontier into a haven for drug lords,
Dilkhan said.
   He said opium production in Pakistan was about 140 tons in 1988,
down from nearly 990 tons in 1980. In Afghanistan, this year's
yield will be anywhere from 935 to 2,200 tons, Pakistani and
Western narcotics experts estimate.
   Opium production, and to some extent export, have existed for
centuries in both countries but experts say three major events in
1979 combined to help build the multimillion-dollar heroin industry:
   _ The Turkish government's crackdown on heroin labs in eastern
Anatolia, forcing production into western Iran.
   _ Iran's Islamic revolution, which ousted the Shah's government
and purged corrupt officials who secretly participated in the opium
trade.
   _ The war in Afghanistan, which began after a Soviet-supported
communist coup in 1978 and has hindered efforts to control poppy
cultivation.
   Opium production declined in the first years following the 1979
Soviet military intervention but increased steadily in the
mid-1980s, experts say.
   The United States, which together with Pakistan backs
Afghanistan's anti-communist rebels, has only recently started
working with guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation.
   Washington is mounting a $10 million program that over the next
three years hopes to promote drug awareness among Afghanistan's
mujahedeen rebels and offer incentives to substitute the opium
poppy with other crops, U.S. officials say.
   American and Pakistani experts deny reports that the insurgents
systematically sell heroin to buy weapons.
   ``There is no evidence of organized (heroin) activity but as
individuals, yes, some of them are doing it,'' Dilkhan said of the
guerrillas.
   Experts say that Pak-Afghan heroin follows three routes from the
frontier westward:
   _ Across northern Pakistan, then south to Bombay for shipping
through the Arabian Sea.
   _ Due south through Pakistan's desert province of Baluchistan,
often by camel or jeep caravan, to the Arabian Sea.
   _ South to Baluchistan, then west through Iran and Turkey.
   The new Pakistani government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
who took office after November elections, declared war on heroin
traffic. The government has received more than $60 million in U.S.
aid for the effort.
   Dilkhan says the government campaign focuses on poppy crop
substitution, destruction of plantations through aerial spraying,
interdiction of overland shipments and drug awareness among the
population.
   Narcotics agents are reluctant to discuss official corruption,
which many describe as a main obstacle to Pakistan's war on drugs.
   ``Lets face it, we're talking about huge amounts of money. That
attracts corruption,'' said a Pakistani narcotics official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dilkhan said police arrested a number of ``mid-level drug
barons'' this year but that it was difficult to collect enough
evidence to bring them to trial.
   ``The money factor is tremendous. It's highly profitable,'' he
said.
   Agents say one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of 97 percent pure heroin
fetches $1,000 at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
   ``Multiply that about 100 times for New York City,'' Dilkhan
said.
   Crop substitution is unattractive to most poppy growers because
they are accustomed to handsome profits, he says.

<HEAD>Congressional Democrats Regaining Upper Hand Over Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats _ reeling in disarray
just three weeks ago _ are using shrewd legislative maneuvering and
a couple of political windfalls to regain the upper hand with
President Bush, according to lawmakers in both parties.
   The new House and Senate leadership came in for criticism last
month, even from their own party operatives, for seeming to be too
accommodating with the president. The griping intensified after
House Speaker Thomas Foley and his team made a high-profile stand
against Bush's capital gains tax cut, and lost.
   But in Washington such conditions are transitory. The past week
has seen Congress defeat Bush on his constitutional amendment to
ban flag desecration; overwhelming House approval of an aid package
for Poland and Hungary that is nearly twice what Bush wants; and a
showdown over federal funding for welfare abortions in rape and
incest cases.
   Bush on Saturday vetoed a spending bill that included the
abortion funds, and while members of Congress concede an override
attempt probably would not succeed, they are talking of sending the
same measure to Bush again.
   ``I think we're back,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a
senior member of the House leadership. ``Timing, strategy and some
luck have added up to our being able to score some points.''
   Asked about the Democratic resurgence, House GOP leader Robert
Michel of Illinois shrugged.
   ``It's like a ball game. Some innings you hit well and score
runs,'' he said, recalling the ``wave of high popularity'' his
party enjoyed a few weeks ago. But the winds have shifted, he
acknowledged. ``If they're feeling good about some of the
developments in the last day or two, so be it.''
   Democrats also seem increasingly emboldened to take Bush on
directly, particularly for his response to the radical changes
taking place in Eastern Europe.
   In a speech last week, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
concluded: ``George Bush appears to be determined to go down in
history as the hesitation president. At least his first year in
office could be titled, `The Year of Living Timidly.'''
   The spending bill vetoed by Bush included money to pay for
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. The
bill would have reversed a decade-old federal policy, a move
propelled by resurgent pro-choice forces.
   But many Republicans are uncomfortable with a Bush veto, fearing
it will put them on the losing side of another hot political issue.
``This is just the wrong front on which to fight that battle,''
said Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y.
   ``There's no question this is going to hurt the Republican
Party,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., an abortion rights backer, said
on Cable News Network's ``Evans &amp; Novak'' show.
   And on the flag issue, Bush's early endorsement of a
constitutional amendment at the Iwo Jima Memorial has proved less
than the brilliant stroke it seemed at the time. Democrats'
strategy to wait the issue out and evoke the sanctity of the Bill
of Rights has been vindicated.
   In fact, it was two last-minute Republican converts _ Sens. John
Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire _ who
helped take the amendment down to defeat in the Senate.
   House and Senate negotiators this week will wrestle with the
issue which represented Bush's biggest policy victory to date, the
cut in the tax rate on capital gains from the sale of holdings like
stocks and real estate. While Bush's position prevailed in the
House three weeks ago, he later lost in the Senate when it was
dropped from an anti-deficit bill.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has said he
doesn't think the Senate will pass a capital gains cut this year,
and said it was ``irresponsible'' to be pushing the initiative when
what Congress needs to do is cut the deficit.
   ``I would like to see the president devote as much time to
historic events in Western and Eastern Europe... I'd like to see
him devote a fraction of the time to that, that he is to this
capital gains debacle,'' Mitchell said.
   Congress also faces a deadline this week to pass a new stopgap
spending bill to fund most government programs until the regular
money bills can be enacted. The new spending measure will include
up to $2.5 billion in aid for victims of the California earthquake,
as well as money for ongoing cleanup following Hurricane Hugo.

   The House ethics panel should keep looking
into Republican Whip Newt Gingrich's ties with a Georgia
businessman, even though the panel's lawyer says further
investigation is not needed, a leading House Democrat says.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. of Arkansas said the ethics panel should
send its own staff to investigate Gingrich's contacts with two
federal agencies on behalf of real estate developer Chester Roush
Jr. because it ``cannot ignore'' an article published this weekend
in the Atlanta Business Chronicle.
   Roush, a longtime political patron of Gingrich, was among the
supporters who raised $13,000 for Gingrich to tour Europe in 1977
for research on a novel. Gingrich, a history professor at West
Georgia College at the time, was elected to Congress the following
year and never wrote the book.
   The article, which was distributed to news organizations by the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that Anthony chairs,
said Gingrich attempted to intervene with government agencies on
behalf of Roush projects twice in 1986 _ once with the Farmers'
Home Administration and once with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   In both cases, the agencies reaffirmed their decisions denying
the relief sought by Gingrich for the Carrollton, Ga., businessman.
   Richard Galen, a spokesman for Gingrich, said he had not read
the article and could not comment on the specifics. However, he
said it sounded like the article recounted a typical
congressman-constituent relationship.
   ``That's what people in Congress do, and they're generally proud
of it, helping businessmen in their area wend their way through the
labyrinth of the federal bureaucracy,'' Galen said.
   Last week, the ethics committee's outside counsel concluded
there was no basis for opening a formal investigation into charges
by another Arkansas Democrat, Rep. Bill Alexander.
   Alexander had accused Gingrich of violating House rules and
campaign finance laws through the 1977 book partnership involving
Roush and another one in 1984.
   ``Merely reading through documents is not enough,'' Anthony said
in a statement distributed along with the article. ``The committee
now needs to send its own staff to Georgia to interview individuals
involved.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of looters and
curiosity-seekers overran the wreckage of a Honduran jet crash,
hampering efforts to determine the cause of the weekend crash that
left 131 dead.
   ``Everyone trampled everything down,'' said Barry Trotter, head
of a National Transportation Safety Board team investigating the
crash.
   Honduran officials were unfamiliar with the importance of
sealing off a plane crash site, Trotter said Sunday.
   The TAN-SAHSA Boeing 727-200 crashed on approach early Saturday
on the last leg of a flight from San Jose, Costa Rica with a stop
in Managua, Nicaragua. A survivor said the plane shook violently
and seemed to plunge just before it crashed in flames into a
hillside.
   Fifteen of the 146 people aboard, including the pilot, survived.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone said 15 Americans were on
the plane and three survived. Two were transferred to hospitals in
the United States, but all three were out of danger, doctors said.
   Trotter said the looting would not necessarily cripple the
investigation, but that evidence had been obscured.
   ``There are no ground scars that would show the angle the plane
hit at, how it broke up and dissipated energy, how it slid,'' he
said.
   The first people to reach the site were peasant farmers, some of
whom live in houses only 75 yards away. They helped rescue
survivors and rushed them to hospitals in pickup trucks.
   Within an hour after the plane crashed at 7:50 a.m. Saturday,
the site was overrun by more than 100 people sifting through
luggage, clothes and papers.
   Soldiers were seen sorting clothing. Children stuffed toys and
clothes into bags. One fireman was observed leaving with a suitcase
under his overcoat. Wallets and billfolds also disappeared.
   Few corpses arrived at the morgue in Tegucigalpa wearing watches.
   Maj. Carlos Aguilar, the Honduran Armed Forces' liaison to the
investigators, said the site was not secured until Sunday
afternoon, almost 36 hours after the crash.
   Some looters were peasants, who earn about $1 a day, but Aguilar
said roads in the area 20 miles south of Tegucigalpa were jammed
with curiosity-seekers on Sunday outings.
   ``There were people hauling out burned suitcases, trying to open
melted zippers. I even saw children taking away bits of twisted
metal as souvenirs,'' said Andres Torres, a member of the Honduran
Congress who visited the site Sunday.
   The ``black boxes'' that record pilots' conversations and flight
data were found Saturday and sent to Washington for evaluation,
Kneebone said.
   Hundreds of people gathered at Tegucigalpa's morgue as doctors
continued the slow task of identifying charred bodies.
   Speculation on the cause of the crash centered on bad weather
along the approach path. Tegucigalpa's airport is at the base of a
ring of often cloud-covered mountains, as if it were at the bottom
of a soup bowl.
   There was also speculation about the 727's age, more than 20
years, leaving it open to possible metal fatigue, which has
affected other older jets.
   Maj. Alejandro Arguello, director of Nicaragua's civil
aeronautics, quoted regional air controllers as saying the roof of
the plane tore away before the crash.
   Passenger Evenor Lopez, a Honduran businessman who was badly
burned in the crash, said the plane shook as though from heavy air
turbulence and seemed to dive more steeply than normal moments
before the crash.
   ``I was on fire when the plane stopped. I tell you, I thought I
was going to die,'' he said.
   Boeing Co. officials said the plane was sold to Continental
Aitlines in 1968. Continental leased the plane to TAN-SAHSA,
according to Continental spokesman Ned Walker, but he didn't know
when.

<TEXT>
   Poland's economic reformers have vowed to
transform socialism into capitalism. So far, Poles are learning one
element: poverty.
   Soup kitchens are opening across the country and the East bloc's
first food stamp program is being readied as Poland prepares to
deal for the first time with a problem that officially never
existed under Communist ideology.
   With government controls lifted, food prices are up 300, 400 or
even 1,200 percent in three months and hunger looms for pensioners
and even schoolchildren.
   There is the new prospect of unemployment as inefficient
factories close for lack of government subsidies.
   When Taduesz Mazowiecki became the only non-communist prime
minister in the East bloc, he warned that Poles do not know just
how painful it will be to revive the nation's ruined economy.
   ``Poland has practically no sensible social welfare system,''
says Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, a veteran Solidarity activist
charged with organizing protection from the worst effects of
economic reform.
   ``Such a system can be introduced but that will take one, two or
even three years. Yet people need to be helped right now,'' he said
in a recent newspaper interview. ``Local communities must organize
themselves for such help. This is where private initiative has an
enormous task before it.''
   Every day, newspapers carry reports of new soup kitchens
opening: In Tarnow, 500 people are getting free meals and 100 more
will be helped starting Nov. 1; a kitchen has opened in Rzeszow and
a second is planned a Solidarity chapter in Gdansk is collecting
food donations.
   ``Milk bars used to be the mecca for poor people. But since milk
and cottage cheese prices have increased tenfold, many old age
pensioners were sentenced to a forced fast,'' the Peasant Party
newspaper said in a report on coupons distributed in Poznan for
free meals at the small seedy restaurants that serve dairy
products, eggs, soup and bread, but usually no meat.
   Up to 4.5 million pensioners, poor children up to age 6 and
others will receive coupons good for free milk, bread and cottage
cheese when the food stamp program starts in December.
   A recent state television special showed the homeless under
highways, on park benches and in train stations. A shop clerk
reported a rise in shoplifting. A divorced woman despaired about
how she would provide for her two children now that their
kindergarten fees demand nearly half her salary.
   The irony is not lost on Poles who for decades saw the homeless
and unemployed in the United States in television footage backing
the official ideology that socialism cares for all and only
capitalism breeds poverty.
   For four decades, the price of food and other basic supplies
were kept artificially low by government subsides. Shortages were
rampant, but bread, potatoes and milk were very cheap.
   The burden of those subsidies became clear when the new
pro-Solidarity government threw open the account books on a huge
budget deficit and began to do battle with deeply rooted waste and
inefficiency.
   ``At least with the new government we are feeling better about
ourselves as Poles,'' said an elderly woman waiting at a Warsaw
soup kitchen. ``But what can the government do with an empty
treasury? We are feeling more free but we cannot live on freedom
alone. We have to eat something.''
   The transition to a market-driven economy from a vast
centralized bureaucracy required lifting controls on food prices.
The outgoing Communist government took that step on Aug. 1 _ but
was criticized for not protecting people whose incomes lagged
behind.
   ``I worked for 30 years in People's Poland, and I have a pension
of 68,000 zlotys ($32) a month, which means I can't afford
anything,'' says a 65-year-old woman named Kristina.
   She pays 8,000 zlotys a month for her room and that leaves 2,000
zlotys a day for everything else.
   A half-pound of butter costs 3,800 zlotys, up from 300 zlotys
three months ago, and a small loaf of bread is 560 zlotys. Two
pounds of pork is out of the question at 15,000 zloty. The woman
points to her years-old shoes and the winter coat from her niece.
She shrugs.
   ``I worked as a teacher for so many years and now I can't even
afford stockings for the winter,'' said another woman. She was
among the mostly elderly people bowed over bowls of potato soup and
bread at a Polish Red Cross kitchen in Warsaw that opened last
month and serves 300 free meals a day.
   Since late September, the organization has opened soup kitchens
in 20 of Poland's 49 provinces, said Marta Kukla, deputy directory
of social assistance.
   She said poverty has increased sharply since August, when the
new government took office: ``We are sure that for some people,
this is the only meal they have.''
   In Lublin, 90 miles southeast of Warsaw, 340 people a day are
served soups and dumplings in a small basement kitchen run by the
Roman Catholic Church-linked Brother Albert Society.
   Organized to help alcoholics and the mentally ill, the society
has now found many others in need, said the Rev. Jan Mazur.
   ``The number of people coming here has doubled since June. They
are normal people, made helpless as a result of the current
situation,'' said Mazur.
   Among them are disabled children from a government institution
that cannot afford to feed them lunch, he said.
   The society runs a shelter for 30 homeless women and hopes to
open one for men soon. Plans also include a free health clinic and
a telephone ``help'' line _ all common elements of Western
philanthropy virtually unheard of in Poland.

   Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the
moon, wants non-astronauts such as teachers, writers or singers in
space.
   ``The space program doesn't belong to just those in the space
business,'' he said. ``It's something that requires the support of
the American people. It belongs to them and I think we have to
begin to make that accessible.''
   He made his comments Saturday at a convention of the New
Hampshire Association of Broadcasters as the space shuttle Atlantis
was in the midst of its mission, which included deployment of the
nuclear-powered Galileo probe.
   NASA suspended its program to send private citizens in space
following the 1986 Challenger space shuttle tragedy that killed
Concord teacher Christa McAuliffe and six other crew members.
   Aldrin said it was time to restart the program.
   Professional astronauts ``are talented in commanding spacecraft
or controlling them or understanding the technical contributions
... but we're not necessarily that talented in being able to convey
the philosophy of what the meaning of this is, what the beauty of
this is because that's not our expertise.''
   He said it would be wise to take a cue from the ancients, who
passed on stories through songs and myths.
   ``In modern days, you put it to some sort of a catchy tune,'' he
said. ``You send a silver-tongued journalist up there and he is
going to write something and we'll read it or he will say something
and we'll listen to it, but we're not going to play it over and
over again'' as we would a song.
   Aldrin, 59, also criticized NASA in general for what he called
its ``lack of foresight.''
   He applauded President's Bush's call for Americans to return to
the moon and head to Mars, but questioned whether NASA was ready to
set in motion those ideals.
   He said the United States should be planning spaceports and
transportation depots for interplanetary travel, which could be
used with smaller rockets and less fuel, instead of launching huge
payloads, which require large, expensive rockets.

   Sen. Claiborne Pell, the courtly chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is considering ending his
30-year Senate career but Democrats say they are ``pushing him
hard'' to run for re-election.
   Pell will be 71 next month and these Democrats say he has every
right to retire.
   But they also say his decision to step aside would make the 1990
Rhode Island Senate race highly competitive, perhaps leaving an
otherwise virtually safe seat vulnerable to a strong Republican
drive.
   Republicans say that if the veteran Rhode Island senator does
retire there is a better-than-even chance that Rep. Claudine
Schneider, R-R.I., the almost-certain GOP candidate, can prevail,
spurring the GOP's drive to regain the Senate majority it lost in
1986.
   ``The Democratic Party and his own colleagues are pushing him
hard to run,'' said a Senate source close to Pell, adding that one
of those doing some gentle pushing is Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine.
   ``We are telling him, `We need you, we want you, you are an
important part of this body,''' said Anita Dunn, communications
director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   ``Senator Pell has said he is undecided; there is every
indication that he has not made up his mind,'' she said. ``I think
his colleagues would clearly like him to run.''
   ``I think it's a blow if he doesn't run,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., a former chairman of the Democratic campaign committee.
Kerry said that is because Pell is widely regarded as all but
certain to retain his seat if he does seek a fifth six-year term.
   ``But it's really his choice,'' Kerry said. ``It's a very
personal thing and it's hard for the committee to intrude; it's
hard for the Democratic Caucus to intrude.''
   Pell has done no fundraising, leaving the strong impression he
will choose to retire. He has repeatedly told associates he is
genuinely undecided but that he will announce a decision, possibly
by mid-November.
   ``I will make my views known at an appropriate time,'' Pell says
when asked the question directly.
   ``He's clearly considering stepping down and is looking for
alternative ways to pursue his foreign policy interests,'' said
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the senator Pell succeeded as chairman.
   Pell has much to ponder. He will be 72 shortly after the 1990
elections, 78 at the end of a new six-year term.
   In Rhode Island, Pell has two conflicting precedents to follow.
   He holds the seat vacated by Sen. Theodore Francis Green,
D-R.I., who was 92 when he retired.
   But Pell has often quoted, with apparent approval, the line used
by Sen. John O. Pastore, D-R.I., when he ended his political career
in 1976 at age 69. It was good to leave, Pastore said, ``while the
music is still playing.''
   On the other hand, Pell is the chamber's fourth most senior
member. He is the author of the Pell Grant program for college
tuition aid. The chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee
represents an ambition realized.
   But Pell, a soft-spoken and reserved liberal, has had to face
constant, often grating guerrilla warfare from Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the panel's arch-conservative. He has often had difficulty
persuading the panel to face up to its legislative burden,
repeatedly failing to obtain the quorums needed to do business.
   Party officials offer varying assessments of the impact if Pell
decides to retire.
   Wendy De Mocker, communications director for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, asserted that Pell himself is
vulnerable to a strong campaign by Rep. Schneider.
   Speaking for the Democrats, Anita Dunn said Pell's retirement
``would move a fairly safe Democratic seat onto the playing field
and make it a competitive race.''
   But she said that should not develop into an opening wedge that
causes Democrats to lose their majority in the Senate which the
party now controls, 55-45.

   Two 100-ton chunks of the upper San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge were painstakingly cut up and lowered
onto a barge 200 feet below to start the job of repairing the
critical earthquake-damaged span.
   For 53 years, the bridge has been the main link between Oakland
and San Francisco. Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake dislodged a
portion of the upper deck and sent it slamming onto the lower
portion.
   The dangerous job of removing the collapsed 200-ton section of
the upper bridge started Sunday. To remove the 74-foot by 50-foot
section, California Department of Transportation workers sawed the
200-ton slab in half.
   The first part of the upper bridge was lowered Sunday afternoon,
said Caltrans spokesman Greg Bayol. A little before midnight, the
second stretch of the upper span was lowered. Work on the lower
bridge was scheduled to begin today.
   During the next month, alternate routes will have to be found
for 260,000 vehicles that had been using the Bay Bridge each day.
Those include other bridges, a makeshift fleet of ferries and the
rapid transit system.
   ``Everything will take a lot longer than it ordinarily would,''
said a dispatcher for the Quicksilver Delivery Service in Oakland.
   The company will use a system of riders on the Bay Area Rapid
Transit tunnel under the bay to deliver letters and small packages
to runners posted at transit stations in the cities, said the
dispatcher, who would not allow his name to be used.
   ``Ordinarily we wouldn't use BART at all,'' he said.
   A huge crane was used to hoist the damaged pieces of the upper
deck off the 8.5-mile-long bridge, opened in 1936, Bayol said.
   Officials say it will cost up to $1 million to repair the bridge.
   Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the
upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first
graphic illustration of the magnitude of Tuesday's quake. One woman
died when she drove her car into the gap.
   The bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 World
Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics.
But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay
resumption of the seven-game baseball championship until Friday.
   Officials hope the added delay will reduce traffic problems.
   The section of lower roadway that took the brunt of the impact
when the upper level fell open must also be removed. But the lower
roadway is not repairable, so it will be ripped out in smaller
pieces later and a new section installed, Bayol said.
   State officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the upper
span and hoist them back into place, he said. It was cut in half
with concrete saws and blow torches to make it easier to move.

   A Wisconsin farmer returning from a volunteer mission to
Nicaragua and an attorney doing free work for a human rights group
were among the 12 Americans killed when a Boeing 727 jet crashed in
Honduras.
   Of the 146 people on board, 131 died when the Honduran jet
crashed into a hillside near Tegucigalpa. Three Americans were
among the 15 survivors.
   Daniel Yurista, 37, was returning home after spending five weeks
in Nicaragua working with the Farmer to Farmer program helping set
up a dairy cooperative, said his wife, Kathy.
   Yurista used draft horses on his farm and had been helping
Nicaraguan farmers use draft horses for field power. He had planned
to fly home one week ago, but was aboard the flight because of
travel delays, she said.
   Yurista lived near Prairie Farm, 45 miles north of Menomonie,
Wis.
   Two other Americans on the plane were private lawyers doing
volunteer work for the Internationl Human Rights Law Group, its
executive director said Sunday in Washington, D.C.
   Amy Young said the lawyers were in Nicargua to prepare for
monitoring the February 1989 elections in that country. She
identified them as D. Lea Browning and Anthony Friedrich.
   She said Ms. Browning, 32, whom the State Deparment listed as
Deborah Browning, was in stable condition in a Tegucigalpa
hosspital. Friedrich, 28, was killed, according to the U.S. Embassy
in Honduras.
   Another American passenger, Eugene Van Dyke, was in critical
condition at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, a duty
officer said Sunday. The State Department identified Van Dyke as an
employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development in
Tegucigalpa.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas claim to have
seized the gem-rich Cambodian border town of Pailin and routed
government troops after months of combat.
   If true, it would be a major psychological, military and
economic victory for the Khmer Rouge, the largest of three
guerrilla groups fighting the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.
   In a radio broadcast, the Khmer Rouge military command described
the taking of Pailin on Sunday as ``a victory of strategic and
historic meaning.''
   During a decade of guerrilla war before Vietnam's professed
September withdrawal, the Khmer Rouge had been unable to establish
a viable ``liberated zone'' inside Cambodia.
   The short, preliminary report said the guerrillas ``utterly
routed'' the defending government troops and inflicted severe
casualties to provincial and district forces. The report could not
be independently verified.
   It said parts of three Vietnamese divisions, whose soldiers were
disguised as Cambodian troops, were also routed and forced to
retreat east of Route 10. The Khmer Rouge claims Vietnam has left
behind tens of thousands of disguised soldiers.
   The Khmer Rouge report said the victors seized 13 artillery
pieces, hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, four tanks, eight trucks
and tons of ammunition.
   The report was broadcast just 15 minutes after the alleged
capture of Pailin. A transcript was made available by a Western
embassy today.
   Pailin, located opposite Thailand's Chanthaburi province, is
rich in rubies and sapphires, which have been mined in the area
since at least the late 19th century.
   Some analysts have speculated the Khmer Rouge want Pailin not
only to boost morale among its fighters but as economic insurance
should Thailand and China lessen or cut their support.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia for four years until Vietnam's
1978 invasion, sending hundreds of thousands of people to their
death as it tried to convert the country into a radical agrarian
commune. Many Cambodians fear the Khmer Rouge will return to power.
   Fighting in Pailin has been regarded by analysts as a major test
of strength between the Khmer Rouge and the government.
   ``I don't see any possibility it can fall into enemy hands,''
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen told foreign journalists in Phnom
Penh a month ago.
   At the time, prominent Phnom Penh editor Khieu Kanharith also
said the best troops of each side were contesting the town. The
editor said on some days as many as 2,000 mortar shells were
falling on Pailin.
   By most accounts, the Khmer Rouge and its coalition partners
hope to seize significant territory in western Cambodia and force
the Phnom Penh government to the negotiating table. A probable
target is the region's largest urban center, Battambang, about 40
miles northeast of Pailin.
   The broadcast by the Khmer Rouge command urged fighters to
``fully defend the strategic town of Pailin,'' continue attacks and
force opponents to the negotiating table.
   The Khmer Rouge's two non-communist partners have also scored
gains since the Vietnamese troop withdrawal in late September.
Western diplomats and resistance leaders say the partners' fortunes
have been boosted significantly by sophisticated anti-tank weapons
that have arrived in the past few months.
   The sources say many of the weapons were sent by France, which
denies shipping any arms to the resistance.
   Reliable sources also say the United States pays the cost of
some of training in the anti-tank weapons. Washington denies
providing lethal aid to the resistance.
   Officials in Bangkok said, meanwhile, that Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand will meet four top Beijing leaders
and perhaps Cambodian resistance chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk in a
three-day visit to China.
   Cambodia is excepted to be a major topic of discussion, the
officials said. Chatichai is to leaves for China on Tuesday.
   China and Thailand are key backers of Cambodia's guerrilla
coalition. The Thais allow military supplies, principally from
China, to travel through its territory to rebels.

<HEAD>It's Mind Over Microchip, 2-0, as Grandmaster Beats Computer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was a battle of world chess champions _ man
vs. computer _ and the mind proved mightier than the microchip. For
now.
   The world champion, 26-year-old Garri Kasparov, coasted to two
victories Sunday over Deep Thought, a chess-playing computer that
can analyze over 700,000 moves a second.
   Kasparov said at first he missed the psychological tension and
energy of a human opponent.
   But then he ``felt a burst of energy from the audience wanting
me to really crush the computer. Because we all have something in
common _ we are all human beings.''
   The champion said computers are moving in the right direction,
and predicted machines will be able to beat strong grandmasters in
two or three years.
   ``I'm very happy I could do in both games what I wanted,'' said
Kasparov, who hasn't lost a tournament since 1981. ``In the first
game, with black, I played quietly. In the second game, I tried to
crush it in the opening.''
   The winner of the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship retired
from the first game after Kasparov's 52nd move.
   Playing white in the second game, Kasparov took Deep Thought's
queen in move 18. The computer hung on for 19 more moves before
resigning.
   The champion noted that the computer kept playing long after a
flesh-and-blood opponent would have resigned.
   ``I think the computer needs to be taught something _ how to
resign,'' he said.
   Kasparov said he accepted the challenge because ``I want to
foresee the future.''
   The world champion was paid an undisclosed sum for the day's
workout, said Al Landa, a spokesman for the New York Academy of
Art, the site of the match.
   The computer didn't travel for the match; it remained in
Pittsburgh with a telephone line to relay its moves to a computer
terminal in New York, where someone moved the chess pieces on a
board.
   Deep Thought, created by researchers at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, can search 700,000 positions per second
and analyze from five to 20 upcoming moves by each side as well as
each move's implications.
   Last November, Deep Thought beat the world's 96th ranked player,
Denmark's Bent Larsen _ the first time a computer had defeated a
grandmaster in tournament play.
   Kasparov, who lives in the Soviet city of Baku, in Azerbaijan,
became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the world
championship in 1985.
   Before the match, chess commentator Shelby Lyman said: ``Deep
Thought is clearly the first chess computer with the potential to
draw blood and defeat the world champion.''
   Lyman predicted the computer would make moves to catch Kasparov
off guard.
   But it was Kasparov's moves that caught the computer by surprise.
   He said he realized early in the first game that he would win
when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and was unable
to analyze all of the champion's decisions.
   Kasparov said if a person had beaten another person as badly,
``He wouldn't be able to stand the second game.''
   In the second game, Kasparov explained he wanted to create a new
opening that the computer wouldn't be able to break down.
   Kasparov said that the computer was ``fully aggressive'' but
that its ``mind was too straight and too primitive.''
   ``Chess is much wider than just calculations. It's even wider
than logic. You have to use fantasy, intuition and some kind of
prediction,'' Kasparov said.
   But the computer does have some advantages, he said. ``We can
lose hope. A computer can't lose hope.''
   ``One of the main goals of the match is to learn something about
Deep Thought,'' said Murray Campbell, who with Feng-hsiung Hsu
created the computer program at Carnegie-Mellon.
   Campbell said it appeared there was a bug in the computer during
the match, which was part of an annual chess competition sponsored
by AGS Computers, Inc.
   ``It wasn't looking at the right moves,'' he said. ``It wasn't
given a chance to show its best style of play.''

   California leads the nation and much of the
world in construction rules for earthquake safety but future quakes
will kill many people unless more is done to make buildings and
bridges tougher, experts say.
   Authorities also say that forecast does not apply to shaky
California alone. Many parts of the United States have earthquake
potential and could learn lessons from last Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude
jolt in Northern California.
   ``The lesson of this quake is that we have the technology to
radically reduce death, injury and damage in case of an earthquake.
Let's get on with using it,'' said state Sen. Don Rogers of
Bakersfield, the only geologist in California's Legislature.
   Unreinforced brick and brittle concrete structures need
strengthening, and tax incentives should be given to foster design
of new buildings with shock absorbers in foundations, quake-damping
devices in walls, and automatic gas-shutoff valves to prevent
fires, Rogers said.
   Tuesday's San Francisco Bay area quake claimed scores of lives,
many in the collapse of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland,
others in toppled buildings. Yet the overwhelming majority of
structures stood.
   In contrast, the quake in Armenia last Dec. 7, which also
measured 6.9 on the Richter scale of ground motion, killed many of
its 25,000 victims in collapsed apartments built with unreinforced
masonry walls and precast concrete floor slabs.
   Armenian cities were also close to the fault, while last week's
epicenter was in a rural area 50 miles from San Francisco and
Oakland. Armenia lacks timber; many U.S. homes are built with
quake-resistant wood frames.
   Nevertheless, ``we would have experienced a tremendous amount of
devastation without the building codes and standards we have in
California,'' said State Architect Michael J. Bocchicchio. ``The
number of lives lost and the amount of damage would have approached
some quakes in other parts of the world.''
   But Tuesday's quake ``was not the ultimate test; we should not
rest on our laurels,'' he said, warning of deadly hazard from
California's thousands of unreinforced brick buildings and
``soft-story'' concrete buildings with stiff upper levels atop
inflexible frames.
   A 1988 U.S. Geological Survey study reported that Southern
California is 60 percent likely to be rocked by a magnitude-7.5 to
8 ``big one'' within 30 years, while the Bay area faces 50-50 odds
of a magnitude-7 quake, possibly on the Hayward Fault beneath
Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward.
   The USGS said a repeat of San Francisco's 8.3-magnitude 1906
quake is only 10 percent likely within 30 years, but a 1980 federal
report said it could claim 11,000 lives. The report said the
Southern California quake could kill 14,000 people; a magnitude-7.4
Hayward Fault jolt might kill 7,000.
   ``Unless we take the threat seriously, we could have an
appalling death toll,'' said Richard Eisner, director of the
Oakland-based Bay Area Regional Earthquake Preparedness Project.
   Past quakes did spur improvements.
   The 1933 magnitude-6.3 Long Beach quake killed 115 people, and
many schools collapsed after students went home. Laws soon required
seismic resistance in new buildings, and old school buildings were
strengthened.
   Los Angeles' Sylmar quake of 1971, with a magnitude of 6.4,
toppled freeway overpasses and killed at least 58 people, many in a
collapsed hospital. The temblor prompted stringent hospital
construction standards, a 1976 revamp of model building codes, and
the $58-million first phase of a program to strengthen freeway
bridges.
   A later phase, not yet started, would have attempted to
strengthen columns that gave way during the Nimitz collapse.
   Much damage from Tuesday's quake wasn't surprising, including
collapse of old unreinforced brick buildings, destruction of homes
sitting on soft fill, and fires from natural gas leaks.
   Seismic disaster threatens much of the nation. Quakes are most
frequent in Alaska and California, but great earthquakes rocked New
Madrid, Mo., in 1811-12, and the Pacific Northwest in prehistoric
times. The East Coast has sustained strong jolts.

   To complete that scary Halloween costume, an
optometrist has designed glow-in-the dark contact lenses.
   Dr. John Herron colors the lenses by dipping them into commonly
used ophthalmic dyes. After being treated, the dyes become
florescent green and red in the dark.
   ``You'll be weird,'' Herron promised. ``But the rest of the
world looks like it really is.''
   Herron began making them for others after he played a trick on a
patient, and she insisted on having a pair.
   The lenses last about a week, and cost $7.50 a pair.
   ``They're interesting and a conversation piece,'' Herron said.
``And I thought it would be fun, especially for Halloween.''
   The Dallas optometrist said he plans to put on a pair and light

   Sue Rakes concedes it may be tough to sit in a

Carolina B.A.S.S. Federation have told her she couldn't
participate, partly because they say men want their privacy if they
need to go to the bathroom.
   Mrs. Rakes has fished her way into the tournament for the past
two years. This year, she qualified by finishing 18th out of 122
fishermen who competed in a regional contest.
   Lyn Wheatley, the director of the B.A.S.S. Federation in
Montgomery, Ala., said the reason women are banned from state and
national tournaments was simple.
   ``Sometimes when you're out on the water, Mother Nature calls,''
he said. ``Even though we don't encourage fishermen to answer the
call, sometimes they do.''
   Partners are matched randomly for the competition; he said
pairing two females in a boat would be a case of discrimination.
The state B.A.S.S tournament will be held on Lake Norman near
Charlotte in April.

   Batmen and Jokers will be on the loose Halloween
night, but a shortage of the trick-or-treat get-ups will keep such
encounters down.
   Managers of Dallas-area costume stores say they are swamped with
requests for Batman and Joker costumes following this summer's
blockbuster movie, but red tape involving copyrights has meant a
limited number of Caped Crusader outfits in stores.
   ``The supplier hasn't been able to keep up with the demand,''
said Howard Hale, manager of the Magicland on Forest Lane in Dallas.
   Dusty Thompson, owner of Costumes by Dusty in Arlington,
followed a hunch that Halloween would be big on superhero costumes.
While other area stores have sold out their Batman and Joker suits,
he still has some costumes available.
   He said the Batman, the Joker and even Superman have beat out
his more imaginative costumes such as giant broccoli and hot dogs.

<TEXT>
   Rhode Island oysters _ as famous as
Maine lobsters until pollution and overfishing wiped them out
during World War II _ may be making a comeback.
   The numbers are tiny as yet, but shellfish dealers report buying
occasional batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest
quahog clams.
   ``There are quite a bit of oysters around,'' said Mark Boucher,
manager of Top Quality Shellfish in Bristol. ``Two, three years
ago, you wouldn't see anybody digging them.''
   But some Rhode Island oyster beds remain off-limits because of
pollution.
   ``The largest oyster population is in the Pawcatuck River, which
has been closed (to shellfishing) for years,'' said Arthur Ganz,
senior marine biologist with the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   To assess the extent of the comeback, the Narragansett Bay
Project next month will start an 18-month study to pinpoint the
bay's oyster beds.
   ``The speculation now is that they are remnants of the
cultivated oyster industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to
1940,'' said Caroline Karp, the project's director.
   Michael Rice, assistant professor of fisheries at the University
of Rhode Island, said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay
in the last few years might be one explanation for the oyster
revival. Adult oysters can live in extremely polluted waters, but
metal contamination can be fatal to oyster larvae.
   Metal pollution at the Narragansett Bay Commission's sewage
treatment plant in Providence dropped from 954,000 pounds per year
in 1981 to 180,500 pounds per year in 1988, said Chip Young,
spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay.
   Parts of the bay distant from the plant are open to shellfishing.
   The oyster industry flourished in Narragansett Bay in the early
part of the century. Because oysters spawn best in comparatively
fresh water but grow best in saltier water, the baby bivalves were
imported into the bay.
   ``The oysters were dredged from coves in Connecticut, schoonered
over to Narragansett Bay and left to grow until they were big and
fat and succulent,'' Ganz said.
   ``The old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the
schooners, sent back to Connecticut and used as cultch,'' the
ragged surface that young oysters need to attach themselves to in
order to grow.
   Rhode Island oysters in those days were known as the best in the
country, smaller but less salty than those raised in the Chesapeake
Bay, Rice said.
   ``They had a mystique about them, something like the Maine
lobsters,'' Rice said.
   Increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and
over-use of oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around World War II,
and many shellfishermen turned to quahogs, or hard-shell clams,
that recently have become a Rhode Island state symbol, Rice said.
   Ironically, a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the
renewed interest in oystering, said Boucher.
   ``They are digging them now more so because of the shortage of
littlenecks,'' Boucher said. ``The upper bay isn't open as much
anymore (to quahogging) so they're looking for any other way to
make a dollar.''
   Oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to $1.20 a pound at Rhode
Island docks, about the same price as steamer clams but less than
the prized littlenecks, the smallest and most tender of the quahogs.

<HEAD>One Month Later, Shrimping Village Worries About Rebuilding Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>McCLELLANVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One month after Hurricane Hugo
bashed this shrimping village, 65-foot trawlers remain sprawled
along the shattered waterfront, bulldozers remove oaks on roads,
and mattresses dry on porches.
   But as the nation focuses on the earthquake in the San Francisco
Bay area 3,000 miles away, this community of 500 is entering the
most difficult part of its recovery.
   Hugo hit just as the four-month shrimping season was getting
under way.
   ``Everything is tied to the seafood in one way or another,''
said Rutledge Leland, mayor of the 150-year-old village located
about 40 miles north of Charleston. ``I think the biggest problem
is the reality of the fact that so much of our economy has been
destroyed and that there are so many people that have lost their
businesses and their boats.''
   Hugo roared ashore Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds and storm surges
of 10 to 15 feet. The storm ultimately killed 18 and caused at
least $4 billion in damage in South Carolina alone before fading
into the Northeast.
   ``Shrimping is one of those things where you make it all in
about 120, 150 days a year,'' Leland said last week. ``If you
haven't made it by Thanksgiving, that's it. And that's just about
the time most of these guys are going to get back to work.''
   Leland's seafood packing plant, which he estimates accounts for
about 70 percent of the town's $7 million in annual seafood sales,
was largely ruined. He hopes to be operating at 50 percent capacity
by the time the shrimping season ends in December.
   About 60 percent of McClellanville's 35-boat fleet was knocked
out of service for at least 30 days to 60 days when the hurricane
swept ashore, Leland said.
   Only 30 feet of the town's 2,500 feet of dock survived the storm.
   Farrell White, 50, has been a shrimper for the past 35 years.
Now his 73-foot boat, ``Daddy's Girl,'' lies aground some 30 feet
from the harbor with an estimated $50,000 in damage.
   ``Shrimping season's over for us,'' White said.
   He hopes to refloat his boat and obtain a Small Business
Administration loan, which could supply up to $500,000 for lost
equipment and wages at interest rates as low as 4 percent.
   National relief efforts have flooded the village with food,
clothing and volunteers, so much so that some has been distributed
to other nearby communities.
   But housing for the newly homeless still remains a problem.
Precise figures are unavailable, but officials say nearly 400
people have asked for federal assistance in repairing their homes
or relocating to temporary housing.
   Lincoln High School remains closed indefinitely; it was flooded
with 7 feet of water. The school's 330 students returned to classes
last week, 25 miles away in Charleston suburbs where teachers are
newly trained in stress counseling.
   For adults, as many as five mental health counselors have been
in town every day since the hurricane. Counselors plan to stay into
next year.
   Leland is concerned about the time it will take the town to
rebound.
   ``I don't know how you put a town under,'' Leland said. ``It was
a real thriving seafood town. (But) it's going to take us four or
five years to even come close to where we were before.''

<HEAD>Life Was Unstable Before the Earthquake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Life for farmworkers was never
predictable, even before an earthquake destroyed at least 370 homes
and forced hundreds of people onto the streets of this farming
community.
   It's a situation many have faced before _ even in the best of
times.
   ``Being homeless is only a couple of dollars away and they are
trying to figure out day-to-day where they are going to live,''
said Estella Mejia, who works for Salud Para la Gente, a community
health clinic.
   ``Life's very unstable and when something like this happens, it
adds to it. They live with crises already,'' Mejia said.
   But normally, those crises are personal _ families living 10 to
a home or workers combing the region for jobs when the harvests are
over.
   This time, the people are suffering as a community.
   ``When we go on the streets and into camps to visit, it's a
little chaotic. But what gives me hope is there are a lot of people
who care,'' Mejia said.
   Watsonville, a community of 30,000, is near the epicenter of
Tuesday's quake, about 80 miles south of San Francisco. It is a
frozen food processing center for vegetables grown in the area's
fields.
   City Councilman Rex Clark said the disaster brought the
community together.
   ``I see neighbors whom I've known for a long time and only say
hello to and now suddenly you stop to talk and see what's happened
to their houses,'' Clark said.
   A half-dozen tent encampments have sprouted in vacant fields
where officials estimate 500 are living. About 1,000 others are in
three shelters. Countless others are living in cars or yards.
   Many residents were so frightened by the quake and its
aftershocks they refuse to go indoors, even though their homes had
been declared safe.
   ``It's just scary. I think another disaster is going to
happen,'' said Rosa Chavez, who has spent nights since the quake
with her 8-month-old baby and other family members in the back of
her father's truck. ``The little kids are afraid of going into any
building.''
   Raymundo Leyva is one of those who fear another tremor could
topple the weakened walls of his house. After Tuesday's quake, as
soon as he could get to a working telephone line, Leyva called his
grandparents in Mexico who had survived their own powerful
earthquake four years ago.
   ``Everyone was crying. They said they were happy to hear from me
because they thought Watsonville was gone,'' Leyva said. ``They
thought it was going to happen, the same thing that happened in
Mexico City. I did, too.''
   City spokeswoman Lorraine Washington said no attempt will be
made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is
determined who was left truly homeless. Workers so far have marked
330 homes unsafe to enter near the hard-hit downtown area. That
total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel into the
outskirts of town, she said.
   Damage to the city has been estimated at $122 million with the
loss of downtown businesses making up a quarter of that total.
   Almost an entire block of businesses bordering a central plaza
where townspeople normally gather in the evenings will have to be
demolished. Several landmarks, including Ford's Department Store
and the town clock, are among those will have to be razed.
   ``That's going to dramatically change the appearance of the
downtown plaza because those buildings were the backdrop,'' said
Clark.
   ``There's a lot of Victorian architecture and no one's going to
replace it with that style,'' he said. ``Hopefully we won't become
glass and steel.''

   The earthquake that left them spiritually
homeless hasn't shaken the faith of the parishioners at St. Francis
de Sales Cathedral.
   The century-old Roman Catholic cathedral was declared unsafe
after Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake _ its tower cracked and
leaning. Many parishioners kept away by a wire fence sought
spiritual comfort Sunday in a Baptist church down the street.
   ``Sometimes in life God shakes us and says, `Pay attention.'
There is something more important than the ordinary things in our
lives,'' the Rev. Joseph M. Powers told the congregation.
   ``It wasn't just the ground that shook Tuesday. The earthquake
shook a lot of things that we do _ ordinary things on our agenda.''
   St. Francis has served people in this community for 102 years.
It stands in an older section of town across from the bus station.
   It rarely draws a huge crowd _ senior citizens, neighborhood
families and some commuters come together to form what priests call
an ``urban community.''
   Yet it is loved and its damage has brought pain to the
congregation.
   ``I need to cry. I need to let go. It's a heavy burden on the
heart,'' said Ona Solom, who assisted at Sunday's service.
   But the Rev. James Keeley notes that a church is more than a
structure.
   ``A building is important,'' he said. ``But people, they are
more important.''
   And while the parishioners at St. Francis sang ``From Our Exile
God Bring Us Home'' people here and in surrounding communities were
joining together to make sure they were all right and to find
comfort and to offer help to others.
   Some churches encouraged congregants to share stories either at
prayer breakfasts or services.
   Churches and synagogues collected money, food and clothes. A
group of Protestant churches started a counseling service, sending
ministers to visit those who need help.
   At the Shiloh Christian Fellowship congregants were urged to
donate their skills to help those whose homes had been damaged.
   ``We don't want to offer only prayers. We want to offer
something more. We want to help people who need it,'' said the Rev.
David Kiteley, Shiloh's minister.

   San Francisco was named the best of the American
cities to visit, but the honor comes at the worst of times.
   The city by the bay, still trying to recover from Tuesday's
devastating earthquake, was named the favorite American city Sunday
the Conde Nast Traveler's Readers' Choice Poll.
   The results from the second annual poll, which appear in the
November issue of the Conde Nast Traveler, were announced at the
opening of the American Society of Travel Agents World Congress in
Miami.
   The poll was conducted prior to the earthquake, which measured
6.9 on the Richter scale and killed at least 59 in northern
California.
   Asked their favorite U.S. city to visit, readers answered San
Francisco, followed by Boston and Seattle. San Francisco was ranked
fourth among cities world-wide, after Florence, Paris and Vienna,
Austria.

<HEAD>Lawyer Fights for her Right to Carry Semiautomatic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many of
her fellow college students were demonstrating for peace, Karen
MacNutt was encouraging women to join her school's shooting team.
   Later, she opposed a ban on firearms at the University of
Massachusetts. And in one way or another since then, MacNutt has
been fighting for the right to bear arms.
   Her latest battle is against a proposed Boston ban on
semiautomatic weapons.
   For MacNutt, a lawyer, the fight is more than an abstract cause
_ she owns and uses semiautomatic rifles, including an M-1A rifle
and an SKS carbine.
   ``I basically use guns for three reasons,'' she says. ``I use
them for protection, I use them for target shooting and I also do a
little bit of collecting.''
   A bill to ban the weapons in Boston been approved by the state
House and the Senate is scheduled to take up the legislation
Monday. In its present form, the bill would require owners of
assault weapons to get special permits from the police commissioner
to keep them and would all but ban any new military-style guns in
the city.
   The legislation _ a so-called home rule petition which is
proposed by the city but which must be approved by the Legislature
_ would outlaw specific types of semiautomatic rifles by model. It
also would create a board that could add weapons to the banned list.
   A lifelong gun enthusiast, MacNutt says the measure would
unfairly punish those who have legally and responsibly owned guns
for years.
   MacNutt belongs to the National Rifle Association and also is on
the board of directors of the Gun Owners' Action League, a
statewide group leading the legislative charge against the proposed
ban.
   Her experience with guns dates back to childhood, when an
antique gun was part of family folklore.
   The revolver belonged to her great-grandfather, a ship's captain
in the late 1800s. According to family stories, he used the gun to
quell a mutiny aboard his leaky ship. Some crew members wanted to
abandon the ship for lifeboats, but MacNutt's grandfather kept them
pumping water instead.
   ``He saved his crew and saved his cargo and it was a good thing
he was able to keep control,'' MacNutt said.
   Her parents encouraged MacNutt and her siblings to ask questions
about the gun and handle it under their guidance.
   ``Firearm safety was impressed upon us at an early age,'' she
said. ``There was never any mystique about it. There was never any
forbidden fruit.''
   MacNutt got her first gun as a Christmas present at age 13. She
still has the .22-caliber bolt action rifle.
   ``I had wanted it and wanted it. When I was 13, they figured I
was old enough,'' she says.
   Today, she owns several semiautomatic weapons, including the
M-1A rifle, a version of the M-14 rifle refitted for civilian use,
and the SKS Simonov carbine, a semiautomatic weapon with a fixed
magazine that holds up to 10 rounds.
   Those who favor the ban question the value of such weapons for
sport shooting. They say the guns only pose a danger to people.
   MacNutt disagrees.
   ``They're not the type of gun that I think anybody in their
right mind would carry into a holdup because they're large, they're
heavy,'' she said.
   MacNutt argues that people who own guns legally don't misuse
them. People who own guns illegally cause the problems, she said,
and they aren't going to be stopped by legislation to further
regulate gun use.
   MacNutt lives with her mother in the Dorchester section of
Boston, an area beset by drug-related violence. She has never had
to use a gun in self-defense, but says feels safe because she can
handle firearms.
   Fascinated by gun history, MacNutt gives a mini-discourse on the
evolution of modern firearms with little prompting.
   Beginning in her college days, MacNutt has worked hard to
integrate women into the sport. She belongs to a number of clubs,
and she shoots competitively on weekends during the warm months.
   There is nothing alarming or exotic about the sport, she said,
adding: ``It's much like a bowling club.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Leaders Meet To Discuss Rebel Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega met in
emergency session with his top security officials after a weekend
attack by U.S.-backed Contra rebels in which 18 soldiers were
killed, the government said.
   The soldiers were ambushed on their way to register for Feb. 25
national elections and the Defense Ministry accused rebels of
trying to disrupt voter registration.
   Ortega met late Sunday with his brother, Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega, and Interior Minister Tomas Borge to consider
measures against rebel attacks. It was not immediately clear what
those might be.
   The ambush late Saturday occurred near Cerro del Mono, about 145
miles north of the capital.
   The soldiers were armed ``but it was a surprise attack, they
fell into an ambush'' and could not return fire, said Ronald
Martinez, a Defense Ministry spokesman at Matagalpa province, where
the attack occurred.
   The attack was part of a Contra campaign to ``disrupt the
electoral process,'' the Defense Ministry alleged.
   Sunday was the last day for Nicaragua's 1.3 million people of
voting age to register.
   Officials said government troops on Sunday also fought off
rebels in Chontales province, 90 miles east of Managua. Lt. Marlon
Rodriguez said 15 rebels attacked the voter registration office,
but there were no casualties.
   Two other rebel attacks were reported elsewhere Sunday, but no
one was reported killed or injured in those attacks either.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and the Contra rebels
agreed March 21 to suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at
a permanent end to their 7-year-old war are at a stalemate and
there has been sporadic fighting.
   There was no immediate comment from the Contras on Sunday's
reports.
   The elections come under a regional peace plan under which five
Central American presidents agreed to disband the Contras _ based
in neighboring Honduras _ by Dec. 8. In exchange, Ortega moved up
the election date from 1991 and promised free balloting.
   Last year, the United States cut off military aid to the
Contras, but Washington still gives them non-lethal aid.
   On Saturday, President Bush signed a $9 million aid package
designed to support Nicaraguan opposition groups. The 14-party
opposition coalition formed for the election has denied any
connection to the Contra attacks.
   Both the Bush administration and Contra leaders want to maintain
the rebels as a fighting force until the election to make sure
Ortega fulfills his pledge.

<HEAD>Rain Dampens Pacific Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell over the Pacific Coast early today, while much of the
nation enjoyed fair weather.
   A storm system moving out of the Gulf of Alaska spread rain
across the northern and central Pacific Coast Sunday, and
threatened to bring heavy snow to the mountains of northern
California today.
   Snowfall totals of up to 3 feet are possible over the highest
elevations of the northern mountains of California by late today.
Rain dampened Seattle early today.
   Dry weather prevailed across much of the rest of the nation,
with clear skies over the southern and central Plains and the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast.
   High temperatures were only in the 40s Sunday in northern New
England and upstate New York. Record lows for the date were set in
Fort Wayne, Ind., where the temperature dipped to 27 degrees, and
in Tallahassee, Fla., where the temperature cooled to 34 degrees.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 91 degrees in Texas at
Childress, Junction, Laredo and San Angelo.

<HEAD>Museum Founders Resign After Making False Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The directors of a Vietnam War museum
resigned after acknowledging they falsely claimed experience in the
war.
   Gaylord O. Stevens and Kenneth M. Bonner, the director and
assistant director of the Vietnam War Museum in San Antonio's Alamo
Plaza, both had displayed photocopies of military discharge papers
that falsely credited them with serving in elite special forces
during the war, the Dallas Times Herald reported.
   Both men resigned after being presented with evidence by the
newspaper that their claims of Vietnam military service were
fictitious.
   Rather than being a Navy Seal in Vietnam in 1968-69, Stevens
served in the Coast Guard from 1969 until 1972 and never left the
United States, according to information provided by the National
Personnel Records Center in St. Louis.
   ``This is fact. This is me,'' said Stevens, when handed a copy
of his actual service record last week.
   Bonner, 31, who added seven years to his age to claim having
served in the U.S. Army Special Forces in Vietnam in 1971-72,
conceded last week that he did not even enter the service until
1978, three years after the war ended, the newspaper said.
   The two said that the end justified the means.
   ``No matter what you say about us, we did something that no one
else has done and no one had the guts to attempt,'' Bonner said.
   ``I knew the museum had to be built,'' Stevens said. ``I still
believe the only way it could have been built was the way it was
built. I assumed a role and I assumed I could take it off just as
easily.''
   Since its July 4 grand opening, thousands have taken tours
conducted by Vietnam veteran volunteers to view the donated war
artifacts.
   ``It's basically a shame that these things occur,'' said Tony
Poncik, president of the San Antonio Vietnam Veterans of America.
``The museum is a good idea. Too bad it was carried out under less
than honorable pretenses.''

<HEAD>Thousands Evacuated In Siberia Pipeline Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people living near a gas pipeline in
western Siberia were evacuated after an explosion and fire caused
by a rupture in the line, which was under repair, Soviet television
reported.
   In a report from Tobolsk, 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, the
evening news program Vremya said Sunday night that the rupture
occurred on a section of the same pipeline that exploded June 4,
killing 607 people in a nearby train.
   No injuries or deaths were reported in the blast in a remote,
sparsely populated area. The report did not specify how many people
were evacuated or when they would be allowed to return.
   Vremya said the blast ocurred when workers tested the line with
water. ``When the pipe burst, not only water, but heavy steam which
was still left in the pipe exploded from the rupture,'' the report
said.
   The blast was seen by experts as a warning that other explosions
may occur on the pipeline. ``Executive councils of the Tumen region
were forced to evacuate thousands of people from the danger zone
along the pipeline,'' the report said.
   According to Vremya, it will be unsafe to fully resume pumping
gas through the pipeline for at least two years.
   ``We believe that two years at least are needed to bring the
pipeline into an operational state,'' chief engineer V.N. Chepursky
told Vremya. If the pipeline is reopened too quickly, he said,
``the lives of thousands of people who live alongside the pipeline
will be threatened.''
   The report said ``The more thoroughly repair teams work, the
more faulty places on the pipeline they discover.''
   The June explosion severely crimped the country's gas supply,
officials said in July. Gas Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said at
the time that the pipeline normally carried 13,500 of the 17,000
tons of liquefied gas sent daily to the country's center from
western Siberia.
   After the explosion, the daily supply was cut by 5,000 tons.
   The 1,155-mile pipeline, carrying a mixture of benzene, propane
and butane from western Siberia to the center of the country, burst
June 4 as two passenger trains were passing in a nearby valley.
   An electric spark from one of the trains touched off an
explosion and fire, killing 607 passengers near Ufa, 745 miles
southeast of Moscow.

   Commonwealth leaders today accused
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of disloyalty for
repudiating the group's new strategy to pressure South Africa on
reforms.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said Mrs. Thatcher
ignored ``fair play'' by issuing a separate dissenting statement
without telling the others just an hour after the summit released
its South Africa declaration Sunday.
   The dispute flared when the 49-nation summit of Britain and its
former colonies resumed in closed session on its penultimate date.
   Britain had signed the Commonwealth declaration, which
incorporated Mrs. Thatcher's objections to key provisions. Those
included giving the white-led government six months to fulfill
promises of dismantling apartheid and calling for tighter financial
pressure on Pretoria.
   In her dissenting statement, Mrs. Thatcher endorsed the
declaration's stipulation that current embargoes should be
maintained but charged that they have strengthened white extremism
in South Africa.
   Today with the leaders sitting round the conference table,
Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the main authors of the
declaration, criticized Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``The price of Commonwealth membership is loyalty,'' Mulroney's
aides quoted him as saying.
   British officials reported Mrs. Thatcher replied she was
``astounded and utterly appalled'' at the attacks.
   Mulroney told reporters after the heated session, ``I believe if
you are going to function in a Commonwealth you have to follow the
basic British tradition of fair play.''
   ``Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' he said. ``You
sign a deal at five o'clock and repudiate it at six ... (saying) by
the way, what I signed really doesn't reflect all my views.''
   Prime Minister Hawke told Mrs. Thatcher, ``This is not the way
business should be done,'' Australian officials reported.
   Hawke and Mulroney said they had wide backing from the other
leaders in the mainly Third World organization, which includes
black African countries that are deeply hostile to South Africa's
white-led government and apartheid.
   The contretemp was the latest over South Africa, which quit the
Commonwealth in 1961.
   For most of the 1980s the sanctions issue has split the
organization, which prides itself on being a unique ``family'' with
a shared language and history.
   Mrs. Thatcher is the Commonwealth's sole opponent of imposing
tough embargoes. She has argued forcibly at Kuala Lumpur that South
Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, deserves encouragement in
moves toward reform, not more sanctions.
   In Pretoria, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said,
``Sanctions can only further delay the negotiation process in South
Africa.''
   ``Any efforts to prescribe a time schedule or an agenda is
rejected by the South African government,'' he added.
   The declaration says the sanctions aim to bring the Pretoria
government to the negotiating table.
   Mrs. Thatcher, leaving the conference hall, said she was
entitled to spell out her ``different view.''
   ``You've got to be fair. You've got to be fair,'' she said.
   New Zealand tried to smooth things over.
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said Mrs. Thatcher's ``way of
doing things ... isn't calculated to make the heads of government
happy.''
   ``But I don't think it is good for the Commonwealth to turn it
into an organization that orchestrates hymns of hate against the
United Kingdom,'' he said.
   British Foreign Secretary John Major claimed late Sunday that
Britain has ``dragged'' the largely Third World organization into
softening its position on South Africa.
   Australia and Canada denied this, saying South Africa will face
new reprisals unless it has set about the ``irreversible''
abolition of apartheid by April.
   In the delaration, the Commonwealth said it would call for
greater financial pressure on South Africa. That includes asking
international banks to restrict South African trade credits to a
maximum of 90 days and make it more difficult for South Africa to
secure loans.
   The body also decided to appoint a new body to scrutinize South
Africa's trade links.
   Mrs. Thatcher objected to these provisions.
   Britain has refused to implement most of a list of 11
non-mandatory Commonwealth embargoes adopted in 1986. Black
southern African Commonwealth members also continue to trade
because of their economic dependence on South Africa.

<HEAD>Four Injured When Passenger, Freight Trains Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amtrak passenger train hit a
freight train at a crossing, injuring four people and derailing two
locomotives and two cars. One freight car knocked a shack into a
swimming pool.
   Amtrak's Broadway Limited, heading west with 230 passengers from
New York to Chicago, hit the southbound 116-car CSX train at 5:43
a.m. Sunday, Wyandot County Sheriff Michael Hetzel said.
   The freight train was carrying ``everything from sand to
syrup,'' including carbolic acid in one car, but none of the cargo
spilled, said Andrea Just, a CSX Transportation spokeswoman in
Baltimore.
   One freight car tumbled from the track, into two outbuildings,
pushing one of them into a swimming pool at a nearby residence in
this north-central Ohio city, Ms. Just said.
   The owner of the house, Mike Swinehart, said he found the car in
his yard when he arrived home. Bob Mackling, who was asleep in the
house at the time, was unharmed and said he was not awakened.
   Amtrak's crew submitted to alcohol and drug tests, which are
required after such accidents, said Amtrak spokeswoman Deborah Hare
in Chicago. She said the specimens were sent to a laboratory in
Virginia and she did not know when the tests would be finished.
   National Transportation Safety Board inspectors arrived Sunday
to determine why the collision occurred, but said no ruling on the
accident was expected until Tuesday.
   ``My understanding is the Amtrak was moving very slowly,'' Ms.
Just said. The CSX train was traveling at about 35 miles an hour,
she said.
   The tracks had been cleared by Sunday night and both trains had
resumed their journeys, according to the sheriff's office. Buses
were brought in from Toledo to carry train passengers to Chicago,
Hetzel said.
   Train fireman Dennis Schleppi, 41, of Fort Wayne, Ind.,
underwent surgery for internal injuries and was listed in fair
condition, according to a spokeswoman at Wyandot Memorial Hospital.
Conductor Forace Brewer, 63, of Bluffton, Ind., was in fair
condition with a suspected heart attack, she said.
   An Amtrak engineer, Robert Whippen, 59, of Elkhart, Ind., was
treated for a broken foot and released, while passenger Ida
Epstein, 76, of New York City, was treated for chest pains and
released, officials said.

   From cash to croutons, tax tips to televisions, San Francisco
Bay area residents and businesses are pitching in to feed and
comfort their earthquake-shattered neighbors.
   And the haves are doing their part to help the have-nots. In
affluent Marin County north of San Francisco, a line of Mercedes
Benzes, Porsches and pickups brought food or volunteers to the
Marin Community Food Bank Warehouse.
   ``We're not all sitting around in our hot tubs,'' said the food
bank's executive director, Anne Rogers. ``People are taking the
lists of items we need and going around the stores with shopping
carts.''
   Around the nation today at 5:04 p.m. PDT, the minute the
earthquake hit on Oct. 17, as many as 100 radio stations will
observe 15 seconds of silence as part of an effort called ``Radio
Relief,'' according to Pollack Media Group.
   Following the silence, stations will urge listeners to donate to
the American Red Cross fund providing disaster relief. The stations
will then play either the Beatles' ``A Little Help From My
Friends'' or Dionne Warwick's ``That's What Friends Are For.''
   While much of the quake aid has come from Bay area companies,
millions of dollars and other donations continued to stream in over
the weekend from elsewhere around the country.
   In Provo, Utah, fans at a football game Saturday between Brigham
Young University and the University of Texas-El Paso poured $60,301
into collection boxes set up for earthquake relief donations to the
Red Cross.
   Coors Brewing Co. in Golden, Colo., sent bottled water last week
and joined with another company to send two trailer loads Sunday.
Three passenger ferries from Washington state are heading to the
Bay area to help transport commuters, but their departure has been
delayed by bad weather.
   Clorox Co., based in Oakland, Calif., gave $100,000 each to the
Red Cross and Salvation Army, and shipped about 1,000 cases of
liquid bleach, cleansers, mildew stain remover and salad dressing
and croutons to relief groups.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., which owns numerous retail stores in
the area, offered free repairs on tires, headlamps and fan belts to
keep ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles operating.
   And Elmwood Park, N.J.-based JVC Co., also with outlets in the
Bay area, donated televisions to Red Cross shelters.
   ``We are proud to be a part of what appears to be an
extraordinary effort on the part of the local business community to
lend a helping hand,'' Peter Lillevand, of the San Francisco law
firm of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, said in a news release
announcing a donation of $50,000 to relief efforts.
   Banks with local branches, including Citibank, American Savings
Bank and the Bank of California, offered cash and, in some cases,
special terms on loans and other financial assistance. Ernst &amp;
Young, an accounting firm, set up a hot line to answer tax
questions about deducting quake losses.
   Elsewhere around the country, church groups organized ``meals on
wheels'' road trips to hard-hit areas. A Seventh Day Adventist
group from Reno, Nev., planned to supply 10,000 meals a day to
Santa Cruz and Watsonville.The Alabama Baptist State Convention
dispatched a disaster relief truck to Santa Cruz, where it is
expected to feed up to 5,000 people a day.

<HEAD>China Agrees To Resume Repatriation Of Illegal Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today China will again take
back illegal immigrants caught crossing into Hong Kong in a sign of
easing tension between Beijing and the British colony.
   Chinese authorities have refused to repatriate citizens who
sneaked into the British colony illegally since early this month,
when Hong Kong allowed a dissident Chinese swimmer flee to the
United States.
   The terse statement said an agreement was reached after
discussions between the Hong Kong government and the local branch
of Xinhua News Agency, the de facto Chinese Embassy in the
territory.
   About 1,100 Chinese were awaiting repatriation today. A
government spokeswoman said she did not know how many would be
returned Tuesday.
   ``It's quite good as far as we're concerned in that we're back
to normality with the Chinese,'' a Hong Kong official said on
condition of anonymity.
   He said he expected the agreement would reduce tension ``quite a
bit.''
   Relations between Beijing and Hong Kong, which reverts to China
in 1997, have been delicate in recent months.
   Many of the colony's 5.7 million people supported the spring
pro-democracy movement in Beijing. China warned the colony not to
become a base for efforts to topple the communist government.
   Beijing was angered when Hong Kong let the dissident swimmer,
Yang Yang, travel to the United States after he overstayed his
visa, instead of repatriating him. Yang had participated in the
pro-democracy movement.
   The local Xinhua office said the colonial government set a bad
precedent in handling the case.
   China then decided to stop accepting the return of illegal
immigrants and said cooperation would not resume until the British
and Hong Kong governments showed their sincerity. Beijing did not
elaborate.
   The government statement issued today said both sides reaffirmed
understandings on the return to China of illegal immigrants and
Chinese who overstay their visas in Hong Kong.
   The Hong Kong government has sent back all illegal immigrants
from China since 1980. More than 12,000 have been sent back to
China this year.

<TEXT>
   Workers have programmed an X-rated game into the
computer system used by New York City's ambulance corps, and an
expert fears it could drag out emergency response times, according
to a report published today.
   Ambulance dispatchers and other Emergency Medical Service
workers could be distracted by the sex game, or the program could
spread a virus into the computer system and cause it to break down,
the New York Post reported.
   The newspaper quoted John Petrofsky, a senior management
consultant for the ambulance system, who said he was fired last
week after he notified his superiors about the threat posed by the
game, ``Foreplay.''
   ``It's a disaster waiting to happen,'' Petrofsky said.
   Petrofsky said he warned top Emergency Medical Service officials
for eight months while he was demoted and then fired.
   Officials will search the system today for the sex game, ``to
see whether we can get a hold of this program,'' Lynn Schulman, a
spokeswoman for EMS, said Sunday.
   The time it takes to dispatch an ambulance to a medical
emergency would double from three to six minutes if dispatchers had
to work manually during a computer crash, said Alexander Kuehl, a
former medical director of EMS.
   ``It's very possible calls will get lost,'' Kuehl added.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from Typhoon Elsie
rose to 30 today from new reports of damage wrought by the
strongest storm to hit the Philippines this year, officials said.
   The typhoon, which packed winds of 127 mph, also left more than
332,000 people homeless and injured 95 others when it hit the
northern Philippines on Thursday, the military's Office of Civil
Defense said.
   Civil Defense officials said 16 died in Isabela province, seven
in Quirino province, two in Nueva Viscaya province, two in Cagayan
province, two in La Union province and one in Benguet province.
Most either drowned or were hit by falling trees and debris.
   The Red Cross, which maintains a separate count, said it could
confirm only 12 dead but said it expected to receive more reports.
   Officials said the storm destroyed or damaged as many as 50,600
houses. High winds also toppled power lines, cutting electricity in
many northern provinces, and fallen trees littered the national
highway blocking dozens of roads.
   Civil Defense officials said damage to crops and property was
estimated at $2.8 million.
   On Oct. 10, tropical storm Dan hit Manila and southern Luzon
killing at least 59 people. Typhoon Angela killed at least 119
people in northern Luzon four days later.
   About 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the Philippines
each year. Elsie is the 17th this year.

<HEAD>Search Ends With No Flange, Investigators Wait on Harvest</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Konny in 11th graf is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTA, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Searchers ended their quest Sunday for engine
pieces from a jetliner that crashed in July, with no luck in
finding a part important to investigators.
   Search teams from metal detector clubs turned up some engine
fragments over the weekend when they ranged over corn and soybean
stubble, but a flange remained missing.
   Investigators hope farmers completing their harvest may come
across the flange, which connected the forward fan shaft to the
disc in the tail-mounted DC-10 engine made by General Electric
Aircraft Engines. The flange was held together with 20 bolts.
   Of the parts still missing, the flange is the most important to
investigators, said Jerry Clark, flight safety investigator for GE,
which called off the search after two straight weekends of hunting.
   ``There's one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary
path of fragments we've found,'' he said Sunday. The location of
parts in fields helps investigators determine what pieces came in
contact with others, he said.
   The No. 2 engine flew apart as United Flight 232 was flying
north of Alta, spewing metal and severing hydraulic lines for
flight controls. Pilots wrestled the jumbo jet to the Sioux Gateway
Airport in Sioux City but the plane cartwheeled down a runway in a
fiery crash that killed 112 of the 296 aboard.
   Volunteers on Sunday found a fragment of a fan blade from the
No. 2 engine and a piece of a track for engine ball bearings, Clark
said. On Saturday, searchers north of Alta found two blade
retainers that were part of the engine rotors, and a part of the
hydraulic pump.
   Along with airplane debris, searchers found artifacts from more
than a century of farming and rural living, including a sledge
hammer and old horseshoes with spikes, which provided animals with
traction while pulling old-time farm implements.
   The search by about 90 volunteers centered Sunday on the Ed
Anderson farm.
   ``I told them that the area they were searching used to have a
farmstead on it, so I'm sure they'll find all sorts of things,''
said Anderson.
   Another resident, Konny Droegmiller, will keep an old brass
sleigh bell that was found.
   ``I'll make it into something to hang on the front door for
Christmas,'' she said.
   General Electric, which called off its search Sunday, offered
more than $270,000 in rewards for engine parts. Farmer Janice
Sorenson received $119,000 earlier this month when she found most
of the rear engine fan disc as she worked in a field. The rest of
the disc was found on the nearby farm of Harold Halverson, who
received about $40,000 in reward money.
   This weekend, a $1,000 reward was paid for a set of shrouds for
a fan blade. The shrouds help dampen vibration and also serve as
spacers between fan blades.

rejected the company's early offer by a vote of 220 to 186, a
spokeswoman said. The union then voted 286 to 29 to authorize a
walkout if a contract can't be reached when regular negotiations
begin sometime after Jan. 1.
   Of the 11 unions at the Post, five have extended their
contracts; three, including the Newspaper Guild, have rejected
early offers. Three other unions declined to participate in early
contract talks and will enter negotiations later.
   The Guild represents 660 employees.
   Major provisions of the contract offer were wage increases of 4
percent a year, the introduction of a drug-testing policy and the
elimination of a ``sympathy strike'' clause.
   Guild officials said one of the most objectionable points of the
offer was the establishment of a ``two-tier'' wage system, under
which some new employees would be paid at a lower scale.
   Nicholas G. Penniman IV, publisher of the Post-Dispatch, said he
was disappointed with the vote and surprised that union members
authorized a strike vote when the current contract did not expire
until Feb. 28.

<HEAD>Report: Secret Subway in Beijing Would Enable Leaders to Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's leaders have built a secret subway line
under the streets of Beijing so they can escape in the event of a
counterrevoltution, according to a British TV documentary.
   The railway network runs between the Great Hall of the People
overlooking Tiananmen Square and the Xi Shan mountain military base
in west Beijing, a former Chinese civil servant told Independent
Television's ``World In Action.'' The program was scheduled to be
broadcast today.
   The unidentified man, who said he fled to Hong Kong after the
June military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, said he twice
rode the underground trains to the military base.
   ``They can have a headquarters there if they wish,'' he said.
``They have hospitals and also army camps and ammunition dumps
there. They have all these facilities open to their use.''
   The former official said two other stations are linked to the
line _ one under the government compound at Zhongnanhai where party
leaders live and work, and the other under the Bank of China where
the country's gold is stored.
   The identities of those interviewed in ``The Terror After
Tiananmen'' were concealed to protect them from arrest. The
producers were not credited to prevent Chinese authorities from
tracing their sources, the program said.
   The civil servant worked at a junior level but was
well-connected. He worked in an office in which he could observe
senior leaders first hand, according to the program.
   The documentary was made secretly in Beijing with amateur video
cameras after the June crackdown, producers said. Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of protesters were killed as troops rolled through
Beijing streets to recapture Tiananmen from the students.

<TEXT>
   Ewan MacColl, who led the folk music revival in
Britain and wrote the Grammy award-winning ballad ``The First Time
Ever I Saw Your Face,'' has died of a heart attack, a family friend
said today. He was 74.
   Trish Carn, a recording executive and friend of the family, said
MacColl died Sunday in a London hospital following heart surgery. A
housekeeper who answered his home telephone confirmed he had died.
   MacColl, son of a Scottish ironworker and part-time folksinger,
grew up in northern England and left school at 14 to become a poet.
   He roamed the slums of Manchester, worked on and off in menial
factory jobs, and embraced a political radicalism that was later to
produce songs against nuclear weapons, apartheid and the Vietnam
war.
   When folksinging became popular, MacColl gained celebrity. He
married Peggy Seeger, half-sister of the American folksinger Pete
Seeger. Roberta Flack's recording of ``The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face'' won a Grammy in 1972.
   MacColl once defined folksinging as ``the music of the people
who produce the wealth ... the peasants.''
   He is survived by Peggy Seeger and his five children, who
include pop singer Kirsty MacColl.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun put his
forces on alert today after rejecting Parliament's peace plan as a
``road to hell'' because it lacks a specific timetable for a Syrian
troop withdrawal.
   In a speech before 5,000 cheering supporters and broadcast live
on his government-controlled radio station, Aoun indicated he might
dissolve the lawmaking body.
   The accord, approved Sunday by a special parliamentary session
held in Saudi Arabia, suffered another jolt when the two main
militias of Lebanon's 1.2 million-strong Shiite Moslem sect also
rejected the Arab-brokered plan.
   Aoun told a late-night news conference Sunday that he accepts
more power-sharing with Moslems, for which the accord provides. But
``what the deputies approved in Taif is a crime I will not
accept,'' he said.
   ``I have demanded a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon but they came
up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue which
constitutes Lebanon's sovereignty,'' Aoun added.
   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic has repeatedly demanded
withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon and in March
sparked the latest outbreak in the country's 14-year-old civil war
by blockading illegal militia-run ports.
   Moslem militias allied with the Syrians responded by shelling
the Christian enclave. More than 900 people were killed and at
least 2,000 wounded in savage shelling duels until an Arab
League-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept. 22.
   Throughout the shelling, Aoun portrayed his military campaign as
a crusade to rid Lebanon of Syrian troops, who arrived in 1976
under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate but later sided with the
Moslems.
   Aoun said a referendum should be held on the accord and offered
to step down if they support it.
   ``If they support me I shall lead them to achieve Lebanon's
sovereignty. Otherwise I will relinquish authority because I cannot
commit the crime of approving such a plan,'' Aoun told the news
conference. ``This accord is the road to hell.''
   The civil war has prevented parliamentary elections, which were
last held in 1972, and it was unclear how a referendum could be
held.
   In his radio address today, Aoun told the crowd outside his
shell-pocked presidential palace that members of Parliament ``must
understand that their role is over and that now it is your turn,
yours alone.
   ``You have to come forth to assume the mantle,'' he said. ``What
happened in Taif is a mistake that should be corrected.''
   That was seen as an indication that Aoun, who heads a Christian
military Cabinet, might dissolve Parliament to scuttle the peace
plan.
   The demonstrators, mostly students, responded to Aoun's speech,
chanting ``With blood, with our souls, we defend you, general.''
Aoun had ordered schools and universities in the Christian enclave
to close for the day.
   Aoun's response, compounded by the Shiite rejection, put the
future of the plan in doubt and raised fears that shelling battles
would resume.
   A senior official at Aoun's command center, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said today that all leave was canceled for
Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops and they were ordered to stay
in their barracks.
   He called it ``a defensive measure.''
   Meanwhile, Aoun discussed the Taif accord with intellectuals,
industrialists, bankers and militia leaders in the Christian
enclave.
   Lebanon's lawmakers have been meeting in Taif since Sept. 30
under Arab League auspices and removed from the strife of their
homeland.
   On Sunday, 59 of the 62 deputies present voted for the draft
plan but made their action contingent on approval by Aoun and his
rival, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss. Two deputies abstained,
one voted `no' and another was absent because of illness.
   Hoss, who heads a Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's Christian
government, welcomed the Taif accord in a statement issued today
and called for its adoption without any reservations.
   ``The only alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide,''
Hoss said. ``No one has the right to take a decision to commit
suicide on behalf of the people and the nation.''
   Today, the deputies prepared to pack and travel to the Red Sea
port city of Jiddah for a closing parliament session Tuesday to be
attended by King Fahd. Conference sources said it would be largely
ceremonial.
   The pro-Syrian mainstream Shiite Amal militia and the
pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, rejected the
accord because they want a bigger representation corresponding to
their status as Lebanon's largest single sect.
   Under the peace plan, the number of seats in Parliament would be
raised from the current 99 to 108, equally divided between Moslems
and Christians. In the Taif talks, Moslems had called for raising
the number to 128, but that was later lowered in a compromise.
   Amal leaders are demanding that the number be raised even higher
than 128 to give ``a wider representation to all militias and
institutions.''
   In a separate statement, Hezbollah said, ``any solution from
Taif does not concern us ... the only system that safeguards
justice and equality is Islam.''
   Hezbollah advocates the creation of an Islamic republic in
Lebanon patterned on the fundamentalist revolutionary regime in
Iran.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, whose Progressive Socialist Party
militia fought alongside the Syrians, said he would accept the
accord ``upon Syria's request,'' but added he was not happy about
it.
   George Saadeh, who heads the Lebanese National Front, a
coalition of various right-wing Christian factions in Lebanon,
supported the Taif accord.

<TEXT>
   It's being called the ``year of 100 murders.''
A once-quiet city has erupted with drive-by shootings, drug-running
and nightly gunfire.
   ``We started on New Year's morning with two drug-related
homicides and it hasn't stopped since,'' says police Capt. George
W. Hegerty.
   The city broke its previous record of 95 homicides in a year,
set in 1987, early in October. Police logged the 100th homicide
early last week, and the toll went to 101 on Sunday night when a
24-year-old man was shot to death in his car on a North Side street.
   Even the onset of colder weather hasn't slowed the carnage the
way it usually does.
   ``There's only been two weeks this year when we didn't have a
homicide reported,'' Hegerty said. ``I was hoping the numbers would
drop off, but they keep going up.''
   Milwaukee residents, who treasure their ethnic neighborhoods,
clean streets and tradition of progressive government, are
mobilizing to turn back the tide of violence.
   Many neighborhoods are forming block watch groups, and in other
cases, residents are simply taking it on themselves to call the
police when they see drug deals or other illegal activity, said
Alderwoman Marlene E. Johnson, who represents an inner-city ward.
   ``There have been a lot of busts lately, and many of those have
been due to citzen alerts,'' she said. ``The key is the people in
the community saying, `Hey, this is enough of this.' ''
   The number of murders has been climbing since 1985, except for a
drop last year. There were 73 murders in 1985, 85 in 1986, 95 in
1987 and 73 in 1988.
   That is despite a decline in city population that started at
least two decades ago. The latest population estimate of about
600,000 in January 1988 was down by about 36,000 from the 1980
census total.
   As is the case in other cities, drugs get much of the blame for
the increase in killings.
   At least 12 of this year's homicides have been directly linked
to drug activity and many of the remainder are believed to have
involved alcohol or drug intoxication, Hegerty said.
   The violence has included so-called ``drive-by'' shootings where
someone fires from a car and then speeds away. Police blame gang
activity for three drive-by shootings last summer, including one
that killed a 30-year-old man standing outside a tavern less than a
block from his house.
   ``Our problem is serious,'' Hegerty said, ``but fortunately, as
bad as it is, I don't think it's as bad as it is in other major
cities.''
   Karen Hendrickson, a Milwaukee native and president of a block
watch group in her neighborhood on the city's near north side,
bemoans the change rising crime has brought to her community. Fear,
she noted, is changing the traditional Halloween.
   ``When we were kids, we went out when it was dark and our
parents let us have the run of the neighborhood,'' she said. ``We
would never let that happen today. We ought to be alarmed by that.''
   The roots of the problem go deeper than the current drug
problem, to poverty and racial discrimination that keeps minorities
unemployed, say Ms. Hendrickson and others.
   ``Give people a better environment to live in and give them
something constructive to do. Then you'll see a turnaround,'' says
the Rev. LeHavre Buck, director of Harambee, an organization
working to improve conditions for inner-city residents.
   ``Now, as usual, we're in a position of reacting,'' he said.
``We're trying to shut the gate after the horse has gone.''

<TEXT>
   Lena Spencer, owner and founder of
Caffe Lena, a folk music landmark where the likes of Bob Dylan and
Arlo Guthrie performed, died this morning. She was 66.
   Ms. Spencer had been in critical condition at Ellis Hospital for
much of past six weeks since falling down a flight of stairs at her
coffeehouse in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
   Doctors said she suffered a heart attack either before or after
the fall.
   Ms. Spencer and her husband, Bill, opened Caffe Lena in May
1960. Over the years, the big names in folk music who played at
Caffe Lena included Dylan, Don McLean, Pete Seeger, Ramblin' Jack
Elliot, David Bromberg, Steve Goodman, John Phillips and Maria
Muldaur.
   ``The Caffe is my whole existence, the be-all and end-all of my
life,'' Ms. Spencer said in a January 1989 interview.
   When folk music suffered a decline in popularity in the late
'70s, Caffe Lena suffered as well and Ms. Spencer struggled to get
by. She earned $32 for landing a bit role in the movie ``Ironweed''
which was filmed in the Albany area.
   She and her husband divorced in the mid 1960s. Ms. Spencer spent
the last several years living in a back room of her coffeehouse, a
small, brick-walled place reached by climbing a flight of well-worn
wooden stairs.

   A police officer was shot and killed today
during a shootout with a gunman who also was shot to death, the
police commissioner said.
   Patrolman Albert Valentino, a 12-year department veteran, died
after being shot once just below and to one side of his bulletproof
vest, said Commissioner Willie Williams. Valentino and two other
officers had been investigating a report of a break-in.
   ``When the officer approached, the man pulled a gun and fired
and the officer also fired and both were killed,'' said Sgt. Johnny
Johnson, a homicide detective. Johnson said there was no indication
of any break-in.
   Killed with Valentino, 37, was George Poindexter, 21, police
spokesman Ed Tenuto said. It was not immediately clear who fired
the shots that killed Poindexter.
   Two officers who also responded to the call were not injured,
police said.
   A 28-year-old bystander coming out of a bar was grazed in the
foot during the exchange of gunfire, police said. He was treated at
a hospital and released.
   Valentino was the first Philadelphia officer shot and killed in
the line of duty since two officers died in 1986, Williams said.
   Last month, Williams ordered all city police officers to wear
bulletproof vests because of a national rise in street violence.

<HEAD>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Regan quotes.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House Chief of Staff Donald T.
Regan, renewing his feud with Nancy Reagan, said today the former
first lady ``has no gratitude for anyone.''
   ``I think she takes too much pity on herself,'' Regan said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' television program about Mrs. Reagan's
new book, ``My Turn.''
   In the book, Mrs. Reagan is critical of a number of her
husband's associates.
   She says James Baker, at one time White House chief of staff and
now secretary of state, ``did a fine job'' at the White House but
``also cultivated the press assiduously - perhaps too much, because
he leaked constantly .
   ``Although Jim did a lot for Ronnie, I always felt that his main
interest was Jim Baker,'' she says.
   Edwin Meese, a White House aide before he became attorney
general, was ``a jump-off-the-cliff-with-the-flag-flying
conservative,'' she said, and one of those who ``are so rigid in
their beliefs that they'd rather lose than win a partial victory.''
She says Meese's personal financial problems ``made me squirm'' and
he should have resigned earlier as attorney general after an
investigation of them began.
   She accuses Regan of taking her interest in astrology and
``twisting it to seek his revenge on Ronnie and me'' in the book of
memoirs that Regan wrote after being fired as chief of staff in the
aftermath of the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``She doesn't seem to realize what's been going on during those
eight years,'' Regan said. ``She has no gratitude to anyone. In
yesterday's Los Angeles Times, they had a full spread on this book
and in it they showed 20 people, all of whom Nancy Reagan
criticizes.''
   Of Mrs. Reagan's charge that he betrayed her confidential
relationship with astrologer Joan Quigley, Regan said, ``Of course
only the two of them were privy to that conversation. But
nevertheless, Mrs. Quigley is the one that determined when the
president of the United States would leave to go on a trip, when
were the best days for a press conference, what were the best days
for him to do certain speeches. That, in a way, is a controlling of
the schedule and when one controls the schedule of the most
powerful man on earth one has an awful lot of power.''
   Mrs. Reagan's book makes light of her influence at times but
leaves no doubt that she expressed herself strongly on many
personnel and other decisions of Reagan's administration.
   ``Had it been up to me,'' she writes, ``Ronald Reagan might well
have been a one-term president.''
   The book, coauthored with William Novak, is scheduled for
publication Friday by Random House.
   Mrs. Reagan says that in 1983, missing her friends and her home
in California and concerned for her husband's safety after one
attempt on his life, she tried to persuade him not to run again.
   Reagan was determined to seek re-election so that he could work
for his policies for another four years and because he believed it
had been too long since a president had served a full two terms,
she says.
   Mrs. Reagan also dicusses her marriage to the future president
on March 4, 1952, saying they experienced a difficult first year.
   ``During that year we had our first child, Patti, who was born _
go ahead and count _ a bit precipitously but very joyfully, on
October 22, 1952.''
   In an interview published in the Sunday editions of the Los
Angeles Times, Mrs. Reagan said of Patti's conception:
   ``Uh, if you're asking if I ever lived with Ronnie, `No, I did
not.' Um, but you're also talking about a man in his 40s and a
woman _ what? _ in her late 20s. We're not talking about
teen-agers. And we knew we were going to get married.''
   The former first lady says her husband was never a
``warmonger,'' but ``his calling the Soviet Union an evil empire
was not particularly helpful in establishing a dialogue with the
other side.''
   Mrs. Reagan says she believes acceptance of her advice might
have saved the president trouble in several instances.
   She says Reagan did not ask her opinion of David Stockman, the
White House budget director who expressed his misgivings about the
Reagan administration economic plan in a 1981 magazine article. But
she says she gave it to him anyway.
   ``Had it been up to me, Stockman would have been out on the
street that afternoon,'' she writes.
   She says she and the president also disagreed about Secretary of
Labor Raymond Donovan, who resigned after being indicted on fraud
and larceny charges of which he was later acquitted. He had done
nothing wrong, she says, ``but as I told Ronnie on any number of
occasions, it would have been better for everyone if he'd stepped
down earlier.''

<TEXT>
   A Miami police officer went on trial today for the
shooting of a black motorcyclist whose death touched off three days
of racial violence in January.
   The trial of Officer William Lozano opened amid tight security
and pleas for calm. Lozano is charged with two counts of
manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist, Clement Anthony
Lloyd, 23, and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24.
   Lloyd was shot to death during a police chase, and Blanchard
died when the machine wrecked.
   Lozano has said he fired in self-defense because the speeding
motorcycle headed straight for him. But other witnesses in the
Overtown neighborhood dispute that version, calling the shooting
unwarranted.
   Defense attorney Roy Black opened the trial by saying it will be
impossible to seat an objective jury in Miami. He asked that the
trial be moved to another city.
   ``We are going to show that what jurors who sit on this case
will have on their minds is that if Officer Lozano is acquitted,
there is going to be a riot,'' he said.
   Assistant State Attorney Richard Shiffrin said the government
was convinced that an objective jury can be seated, and he opposed
defense efforts to introduce television tape, newspaper articles
and witnesses to tell the story of the January riot.
   ``To replay everything that has transpired since January would
be unnecessary, and in addition tends to inflame the community,''
the prosecutor said.
   Circuit Judge Joseph Farina said he would consider starting jury
selection immediately, and then sequestering the panel during
subsequent pre-trial motions so they will not be affected by
publicity before testimony starts.
   Outside the Metro-Dade Justice Building, Lozano's friends and
family members waved Colombian flags and placards of support as
they marched up and down a sidewalk.
   A smaller group denounced the Colombian-born officer. One man,
who loudly proclaimed Lozano ``a cold-blooded murderer,'' was taken
into custody when he tried to enter the courtroom.
   Police killings of blacks _ or the subsequent trials _ have
triggered violence in Miami four times in the 1980s, and crisis
teams were in place today around the racially tense city. The fear
of renewed violence was a key to the defense's effort to move the
trial from Miami.
   The Jan. 16 slaying touched off burning and looting in
predominantly black neighborhoods. One person was killed, 11 were
wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before
the Miami area was host to the Super Bowl.
   Tensions, especially between blacks and Hispanics, remained high
after the violence. At one point, an attorney for the Hispanic
Officers Association wrote a letter to Police Chief Perry Anderson
asking that its members be pulled from black neighborhoods because
of residents' anger. The chief, who is black, denied the request.
   Blanchard's family has filed a $10 million federal lawsuit
against the city, accusing the police department of displaying a
pattern of violence, especially toward blacks.
   Many Hispanics have taken up Lozano's cause, collecting money
for him during radio pledge drives.
   The Metro-Dade police force, which patrols part of the largely
black Liberty City area hit by riots in January, has given its
officers riot classes and new gas masks, and has two armored trucks
on standby.
   Even while urging calm, black leaders including Willie Sims of
Dade's official Community Relations Board acknowledge that blacks
are intently watching the trial. The board has been training teams
that will head into any neighborhood where violence begins.
   ``I won't sit here and tell you that nothing, absolutely zero,
will happen,'' Sims said. ``But we are optimistic that whatever
does occur, we will be able to reduce the level drastically.''
   The board has proposed an interracial pop concert on Nov. 10 and
a ``unity summit'' to help keep the peace.

   Vice President Dan Quayle helped state
Republicans raise about $150,000 today and told party supporters
that putting a Democrat back in the governor's chair would mean
higher taxes for New Jersey.
   Quayle told a crowd at a breakfast fund-raiser that Republican
Rep. Jim Courter will move New Jersey forward if elected governor
Nov. 7 while Democratic Rep. James Florio would return the state to
days of increased unemployment and high taxes.
   ``There are three things certain in life, and those are death,
taxes and Democrats wanting to raise your taxes,'' Quayle told the
audience at the Radisson Hotel.
   About 200 people paid $250 each to dine with Quayle and about 75
people paid $1,000 each to have their picture taken with the vice
president.
   Florio, meanwhile, was scheduled to meet on the campaign trail
with Sens. Bill Bradley and Frank Lautenberg.
   Courter rallied the GOP faithful Sunday in the heart of his
Republican-rich congressional district, where supporters looked for
a late surge in the trailing campaign.
   Courter has received heavy media attention for remarks on
abortion and homosexuals. He first said homosexuals should be
barred from teaching jobs and that he would sign a bill to outlaw
abortion, but he later said he would not restrict abortion and
would not move to restrict the hiring of homosexuals.
   Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who has appeared with Courter
just twice since Labor Day, is barred by the state constitution
from seeking a third four-year term.

   Several hundred East German workers at an
electronics plant outside East Berlin have formed the communist
nation's first independent labor union, a spokesman said today.
   Roelf Boerger said the union's platform includes a demand for
the right to strike, and he urged all 6,000 employees of the
Wilhelm Pieck factory in Teltow to join the new labor movement. He
said the union's name is ``Reform.''
   Boerger's statement was distributed to Western news media in
West Berlin.
   Despite a more candid approach to news reporting in recent days,
the state-run ADN news agency made no immediate mention of the
electronics workers' declaration.
   Boerger said the union declares solidarity with new opposition
political groups in East Germany and calls for a thorough
restructuring of the communist state's economy.
   The new leadership's attitude toward the Reform trade group was
not immediately made clear. The factory where it was founded is
named after East Germany's first president.
   On Sunday, the head of the state-controlled trade federation
called for more independence for labor organizations.
   Since Egon Krenz took over the nation's leadership from Erich
Honecker on Wednesday, the official news media have been filled
with unusually frank articles about the nation's troubles.
   But neither Krenz nor other senior Communists have indicated any
willingness to share power with opposition groups or allow an
independent trade movement like Poland's Solidarity to take root.
   The Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland today devoted
four pages to reform discussions that it said were ``going on all
across the nation.''
   The newspaper also gave prominent play to a lively, public
exchange between top communist officials in East Berlin and
pro-democracy activists on a downtown East Berlin street on
Saturday.
   Neues Deutschland devoted nearly a full page to discussions held
in Leipzig on Sunday concerning East Germany's economic and social
problems.
   For the first time, the newspaper quoted a member of the
outlawed Neues Forum (New Forum) opposition group as saying the
group does not consider itself a real opposition party, ``because
we want to improve socialism.''
   ``But democratic reforms are necessary,'' the newspaper quoted
Neues Forum member Petra Lux as saying.
   East Germany's Liberal Democratic Party, which like others in
the country is allied with the Communist Party, has urged the
government to recognize Neues Forum, which was banned as
``anti-social'' by authorities last month.

   A federal prosecutor today outlined
evidence against five Americans charged with conspiring with
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas to smuggle and distribute
cocaine in the United States.
   In closing arguments in what has been dubbed the ``Son of
Lehder'' trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller told jurors
that the conspiracy began in 1974 and continued until early this
year.
   Following arguments from the five defense attorneys, U.S.
District Judge John H. Moore II will give instructions to the 12
jurors so they can begin their deliberations.
   The government contends the five defendants were involved in a
conspiracy with Lehder that began in 1974 and continued through
February of this year.
   Lehder, 40, was convicted last year and sentenced to life in
prison without the possibility of parole for running a massive
smuggling operation. He was convicted following a 7{-month trial.
   The latest case grew out of an investigation that followed
Lehder's trial.
   Defense attorneys say their clients either weren't part of the
Lehder conspiracy or withdrew from it so long ago that they should
come under the statute of limitations.
   On trial are Jack Carlton Reed, 59, who was convicted last year
on drug conspiracy charges and sentenced to 15 years in prison;
Thomas Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.; attorney Barry Kane,
52, of Hyannis, Mass.; Donald Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif.; and air
charter service owner Samuel T. Stewart, 53, of Anaheim, Calif.
   Prosecutors claim Reed, who is charged with operating a
continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to distribute, often
acted as an intermediary between Lehder and his corps of Americans
pilots and distributors.
   Herington faces one count of conspiracy to distribute five
kilograms or more of cocaine. Kane, Lady, and Stewart face the
conspiracy distribution count and an addition charge of conspiracy
to import cocaine into the United States.
   If convicted, the men face sentences of 10 years to life.

   Morning traffic was heavy and stormy
weather played havoc with the elaborate transit plans of 3 million
commuters, many of whom abandoned their cars to board buses, trains
or ferries on the first major workday since an earthquake ravaged
the city.
   Normally crowded freeways and the Bay Bridge, which links San
Francisco and Oakland, remain closed because of damage. Commutes
that usually take 45 minutes were forecast at two hours.
   California Highway Patrol spokesman Don Gappa reported fewer
accidents than normal, and no major problems.
   ``The volume of traffic is worse than normal,'' Gappa said. ``If
we didn't have rain we probably wouldn't have as many problems as
we do. There are more problems with flooding and trees down than
traffic accidents.''
   Traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but
moving shortly after 5 a.m. PDT, and many people appeared to be
carpooling. Highway 101 was a sea of lights, some parking lots at
subway stations were full, and one ferry that normally sails with
140 people carried 572 on an early trip.
   Gale warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in some
areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the
San Francisco Bay, authorities said.
   On the 6 a.m. ferry from Oakland to San Francisco, a 30-minute
crossing took 55 minutes through heavy seas, with swells
occasionally washing over the top of the boat.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it,'' said passenger John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda,
who normally would drive across the Bay Bridge. ``It can only get
better, this can't get much wors.''
   ``Everybody's just going to have to go into slow-motion. That
includes all the bosses,'' said Karen Meyer, 42, of Oakland.
   The effort to avoid ``gridlock'' reached a feverish pitch
Sunday, when Rod Diridon, chairman of the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, declared riding alone in a vehicle an
``anti-social act.''
   ``We've got to convince people that it's not business as usual
and that it won't be business as usual in some places for years,''
Diridon said.
   A fleet of ferries was called into service to make more than 225
trips shuttling an estimated 10,000 stranded residents from the
east side of the bay to San Francisco.
   But at best, conceded Joel Markowitz, MTC's manager of transit
coordination, post-quake planning ``might avoid a total disaster''
on the roads.
   ``We're optimistic, but I think that realistically, a lot of
people are still going to try to squeeze on the roads,'' he said.
   Experts predicted that two-thirds of commuters in the
nine-county Bay area would experience delays as they tried to get
to and from work.
   The collapse of a portion of the Bay Bridge, which typically
carries 65,000 people during rush hour every weekday, created the
biggest headache, and snarls were expected on other major arteries
as commuters tried alternate routes.
   In Oakland, the ruin of Interstate 880 cut off a major
thoroughfare that used to carry 170,000 vehicles daily. Repairs are
expected to take years.
   The Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront in San Francisco,
which connects downtown with the North Beach district and
Fisherman's Wharf, has been deemed unusable until at least
mid-1990. A five-mile stretch of Interstate 280 in San Francisco
was closed from U.S. Highway 101 to Sixth Street.
   In Santa Cruz, State Highway 17 was closed to through traffic
because of landslides and mudslides. That four-lane road provides a
critical link for 20,000 people who commute daily to work in
Silicon Valley. It will be closed indefinitely, although one lane
is open to buses and emergency vehicles.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit district, which runs trains through a
tube under the San Francisco Bay, beefed up service and planned to
start running trains around the clock beginning at midnight.
   BART telephone information lines were jammed Sunday, with delays
of several minutes common once callers got through the busy signals.
   Callers to a carpool service that matched riders with drivers
also had to be patient as workers fielded a steady stream of calls.
   ``There's two of us here and it's kept us busy,'' said Kathleen
McKinney of Solano Rideshare, a state-funded carpool operation.
   MTC's Markowitz said many large corporations had expressed
interest in offering flex-time schedules to help dilute the
commute, but no one dared predict how many workers would work
off-hours.
   Markowitz, who expressed hope the crisis would force long-term
changes in the way people get around in the Bay area, had only one
wish.
   ``I think we're going to see a lot of people who haven't tried
transit try it,'' he said. ``I just hope they'll be tolerant,
patient and have a good sense of humor.''

<TEXT>
   More than 150 cars slammed into
each other today in chain-reaction pileups on fog-shrouded southern
highways, seriously injuring six people, police in Bavaria state
reported.
   Police said excessive speed was the major cause of the accidents
that occurred in heavy fog with visibility at less than 50 yards.
   One hundred vehicles were involved in the first collisions on
the A-93 Autobahn between Weiden and Regensburg, about 95 miles
north of Munich, police said.
   In a second chain-reaction crash, 55 vehicles piled up on the
A-3, another superhighway between Regensburg and Passau near the
border with Austria, police said in a statement released to the
news media.
   West German autobahns, many of which have long stretches with no
speed limits, are often the scene of crashes in the foggy autumn
months.

   Caustic fumes released by a spill of
hydrochloric acid forced the evacuation of more than 2,000
residents, and 39 people were treated for eye and throat irritation.
   Those evacuated were permitted to return to their homes early
today after a caustic cloud formed from the acid dissipated,
officials said.
   Authorities said a crack in a transmission pipe at Photocircuits
Atlanta Inc. in Peachtree City caused the spill of more than 300
gallons of the acid at 8 p.m. Sunday. Peachtree City is about 25
miles southwest of Atlanta.
   Thirty-nine people were treated at Clayton General Hospital for
minor eye and throat irritation apparently caused by caustic fumes
from the spill, hospital spokeswoman Sharon Lynch said. No one was
admitted.
   About half the people treated were plant workers, while the
others were workers at nearby businesses, some civilians in the
area and the first police officers to arrive at the scene, said
Fayette County Emergency Services Capt. Doug Morris.
   Officials evacuated residents from an area of about two square
miles around the plant. Emergency shelters were established at two
schools and four churches.

   Former President Richard M. Nixon is
going to China to meet with government leaders late this month on a
visit delayed because of the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators last spring.
   Nixon's spokesman, John H. Taylor, said the former president's
meetings with officials in Bejing would begin around Oct. 30. For
security reasons, Taylor said, his precise travel plans were not
disclosed.
   Taylor said Nixon had discussed his plans with President Bush
and with Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security
adviser. ``He will give his assessment of the leaders, their
policies and Chinese-American relations in general in writing to
President Bush upon his return,'' the aide said.
   The trip will be Nixon's sixth since, as president, he re-opened
U.S. relations with mainland China in 1972. Taylor described it as
``solely a fact-finding trip'' with no sightseeing or social
events. He said Nixon will be paying his own expenses and those of
the one security aide who will travel with him.

   About 600 firefighters got help
from rain to substantially encircle a blaze that has charred nearly
11,000 acres of wilderness since last week.
   The fire was declared 80 percent contained Sunday, with full
containment expected by tonight.
   The blaze began Wednesday during a military training exercise on
firing ranges at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton, spreading to the
San Mateo Canyon wilderness area in Cleveland National Forest. An
investigation to find a cause continued.
   Firefighters said they saw little of the fire smoldering.
   ``But the problem is until you get a couple days' sun on it
you're not sure where it's still hot,'' said Bruce Bundick of the U
.S. Forest Service. ``All it takes is one root or one stump still
smoldering that we don't notice, and the winds come up, and it's
off and running again.''
   Although there was activity on the northeastern flank of the
fire, the blaze did not spread Sunday, Forest Service spokeswoman
Audrey Hagen said.
   Firefighters using infrared detectors will examine the entire
fire line before the blaze is declared out, Bundick said.

   The extreme rightist Republican
Party made strong showings in city elections in West Germany's
richest state, sparking demonstrations in at least two cities,
officials said today.
   The Republicans, running candidates for the first time in many
cities of Baden-Wuerttemburg, often garnered more than 10 percent
of the vote in Sunday's balloting, according to preliminary figures.
   The results are expected to put further pressure on Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which
lost more than 5 percent of the vote in the largest cities.
   ``The Republicans won't improve anything. They will just make
politics more difficult,'' said Stuttgart's CDU mayor, Manfred
Rommel, after the Republicans picked up its first five of the 60
city council seats, or 9.6 percent of the vote.
   The CDU lost four of its 24 seats in Stuttgart, the state
capital, falling from 38.8 percent to 33.1 percent of the vote.
   More than 200 young protesters gathered in front of Stuttgart's
city hall Sunday night to demonstrate against the wins by the
Republicans, who are led by Franz Schoenhuber, a former Nazi Waffen
SS soldier.
   About 150 young leftist protesters stormed city hall in
Karlsruhe, where the Republicans won 6.9 percent of the vote to
gain about four out of the 60 city council seats. No arrests or
injuries were immediately reported.
   The Republicans garnered more than 10 percent of the vote in
Pforzheim and Heilbronn, and 14.2 percent in Heidenheim, all cities
of about 100,000 people. The party even picked up cities in the
traditional leftist stronghold of Freiburg.
   Officials said final results were expected later in the week but
emphasized they expected no significant changes from today's
tallies.
   Kohl's party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives calling
for a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, while
the left has accused the CDU of already making too many concessions
to the far-right.
   Republican victories date back to January, when the party won 11
of the 138 seats in the West Berlin legislature. Since then the
party has gained city council seats in other major cities,
including Cologne, Dortmund and Duesseldorf as well as in parts of
Hesse state.
   Founded in 1983, the Republicans have run on a platform of
law-and-order and slashing the number of foreign workers in West
Germany. They won six seats in the European Parliament, taking 7.1
percent of the vote in the West German voting in June.
   Schoenhuber has said he expects the party will gain more than 5
percent of the vote in national voting in December 1990 to enter
the federal Parliament in Bonn. Several public opinion polls have
indicated that may be an unrealistic goal.
   Another rightist extremist group, the National Democratic Party,
won seven seats in the Frankfurt city council in March.

   Former President Reagan had lunch with Emperor
Akihito today and received one of Japan's top honors _ the Grand
Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum _ for promoting
free trade and friendship with Japan.
   The award ceremony and luncheon at the Imperial Palace in
central Tokyo was the first meeting between the two men since
Akihito succeeded his father, the late Emperor Hirohito, in January
and since Reagan retired to California.
   ``I am humbled and deeply honored to have been awarded,'' Reagan
said.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko looked on as palace Grand Master of
Ceremonies Kiyoshi Sumiya presented the award to Reagan, palace
officials said. Nancy Reagan, Crown Prince Naruhito and Ambassador
Michael Armacost also attended the ceremony and luncheon, they said
on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagans last met the imperial couple in October 1987 when
they made an official visit to the United States.
   Reagan received the award from the Japanese government for
promoting peace and friendship with Japan and for working to
protect the free trade system during his eight years in office,
officials said. The last and only other U.S. president to receive
the honor was Dwight Eisenhower.
   Later in the day, Reagan, who is in Japan at the invitation of
Fujisankei Communications Group and the Japanese government, met
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and attended a dinner held by
Kaifu in his honor.
   At the dinner, Kaifu admired Reagan's popularity, noted the
deepening of bilateral relations during his years in office and
warmly congratulated Reagan on his award.
   ``I know that over the years, every relationship has its ups and
downs. Even among the best of friends, there are sometimes issues
which need careful and candid evaluation,'' Reagan said, alluding
to often rocky trade issues.
   Reagan and Fujisankei have refused to confirm reports he will
receive about $2 million for his appearances on television and at
charitable events during his Oct. 20-28 stay.
   Fujisankei, Japan's largest media group, has said it was
spending $7 million on the visit. On Sunday, the group sponsored a
gala benefit concert for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
attended by over 10,000 people.
   Like its chairman, Nobutaka Shikanai, many of Fujisankei's media
outlets espouse conservatism and nationalism.
   At the time of Hirohito's death on Jan. 7, the Fuji TV network
generally carried less critical views of Japan's imperial system.

   Former federal judge Alcee Hastings,
who was removed from office last week after being impeached, filed
Monday as a candidate in the 1990 Florida governor's race.
   Hastings, 53, filed with the state Division of Elections to open
a campaign account as a Democratic candidate. He has sought public
office unsuccessfully on two prior occasions.
   ``I would be an inspirational leader for the people,'' said
Hastings, who added that the notoriety from his impeachment trial
would benefit him in his effort to win the Democratic nomination.
   ``It gives me an immediate bounce,'' he said. Hastings said more
people in Florida know him than his Democratic opponents, U.S. Rep.
Bill Nelson of Melbourne and state Sen. George Stuart of Orlando.
   ``I got fired by people who didn't read or understand the
dynamics of the evidence as it was presented,'' Hastings said of
his removal from U.S. District Court. ``I believe myself to be a
man of honor and integrity. I have not committed any crime at any
time.''
   Hastings said he would discuss the impeachment hearings early in
his gubernatorial campaign, but hoped the focus would soon shift to
matters relevant to the governor's race.
   ``My interests, I believe, are the interests of the people of
Florida,'' Hastings said.
   Hastings ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1970 and for
the Public Service Commission in 1974.
   He said he would campaign on a platform of restructuring
Florida's government and tax base. He favors abolishing the cabinet
and lieutenant governor's office and having a unicameral
Legislature.
   Hastings said he began thinking about the gubernatorial race six
months ago.
   ``I had to face the reality that I would be removed from
office,'' he said.
   Incumbent Gov. Bob Martinez and state Sen. Marlene
Woodson-Howard have announced they will run on the Republican side
of the race.

   The NATO allies will stage their first
Europe-wide, computer-simulated combat exercises for top commanders
next month, NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe said
today.
   ``Exercise ACE 89'' will be the first such exercise involving
all of NATO's top regional military commanders, a headquarters
official said. It is scheduled for Nov. 6-17.
   In the exercise, combat will be simulated by a central computer
near Ramstein Air Base in West Germany and computers at regional
NATO headquarters across Europe.
   The central computer will present NATO commanders with a combat
situation, involving conventional air, land and sea forces, to
which they must react, said Maj. Robert Bittmer, a headquarters
spokesman.
   No troops will leave their bases but ``to the senior commanders
it will appear as if there are troops in the field,'' Bittmer said.
   The central computer executes the combat decisions made by the
regional commanders who will discuss and assess the results of
their actions through daily teleconferences.
   NATO's major regional headquarters participating in the exercise
are those in Kolsaas, Norway; Brunssum, the Netherlands; Naples,
Italy, and High Wycombe, Great Britain.

   Lenin's tomb in Red Square will be closed for two
months beginning in November for essential maintenance, Tass said
Monday.
   The mausoleum will be closed from Nov. 10 to Jan. 15, 1990, the
brief announcement from the Kremlin commandant's office said.
   The red granite tomb draws thousands of visitors daily, both
foreign tourists and visiting Soviets, who file past the embalmed
body of the founder of the Soviet state or watch the changing of
the guard in front of the tomb.
   There have been several suggestions recently, in the media and
at the Congress of People's Deputies, that Lenin's remains be
removed from the mausoleum and reburied in a cemetery.
   There was no hint in the brief Tass dispatch that Lenin's
remains would be moved during the maintenance, which is carried out
every few years.

<HEAD>Killer Whale Seems to Court Ferry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AALESUND, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A killer whale has been swimming
alongside a Norwegian ferry for the past week, in what the captain
said Monday looked like a case of whale courtship.
   ``It's hard to say who fell in love with whom,'' said Olav
Mundal, captain of the ferry B-F Voksa. Passengers and crew are as
taken with the black and white whale as the whale is with the black
and white ship.
   Mundal said by radio telephone the whale seldom leaves the
ferry's side as it sails a 12-mile route through a fjord near
Aalesund.
   The 13-foot whale hugs the ship's hull, sometimes gently bumps
against it, and often sprays passengers with water. School classes
have been buying tickets on the ferry to see it.
   ``People are very interested. Sometimes when we dock there is a
crowd of people waiting on the wharf for it,'' he said.
   The courtship doesn't endanger the whale or the ship, he said.
   Mundal said the whale has not disappeared for more than a few
hours at a time. It may have adopted the ship after straying from a
killer whale flock seen in the area three weeks ago, he said.

   Police and military units in Kirghizia carried out
a seven-day narcotics operation and netted 352 pounds of marijuana,
Tass said Monday.
   The operation was carried out in the Chu valley, the main
narcotics producing area in Khirgizia, 1,600 miles southeast of
Moscow, according to the official news agency.
   Tass said the entire valley was sealed off and special military
units formed to fight organized crime took part in the operation.
   Tass did not say if any arrests were made in the raid, and more
than 5,000 cars were searched.
   Drugs are produced and processed in the republic, then
distribut6ed throughout the Soviet Union, Tass said.
   It said a special division has been set up by the republic's
Interior Ministry to combat the spread of drugs, including a school
to train dogs to sniff out narcotics.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarians today for the first time
officially marked their anti-Stalinist revolt that Soviet tanks
crushed in 1956, with more than 100,000 people cheering for closer
ties with the United States.
   Over national television acting president Matyas Szueroes
proclaimed Hungary a republic in a symbolic rejection of communist
dominance, and church bells pealed across the country.
   ``As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic of
Hungary,'' said Szueroes, after Parliament last week voted to
change the name from ``People's Republic.'' Communists had renamed
the country after assuming power in 1948.
   Hoots and whistles greeted Szueroes' call for cooperation with
the Soviet Union. But the crowd, estimated at more than 100,000,
cheered and clapped when he urged warmer ties with the United
States.
   ``We continue to view the uninterrupted development of our ties
to the Soviet Union as in our nation's interests,'' Szueroes said.
``At the same time, we also seek to improve (contacts) with the
other superpower, the United States of America.''
   A reference to planned democratic elections next year also drew
prolonged applause.
   ``The Republic of Hungary has become a state governed by law,
where the values of ... (Western) democracy and democratic
socialism are equally valid,'' Szueroes said.
   Many people sported lapel pins showing the red, white and green
Hungarian flag with a jagged hole in the middle, symbolizing the
communist emblem cut out during the revolt. Others displayed
buttons with the pre-communist coat of arms that was resurrected
briefly in 1956.
   It was one of the largest gatherings since Oct. 23, 1956, when
an estimated 200,000 people marched on Parliament to press
democratic demands.
   Szueroes' proclamation was a highlight of numerous officially
organized events and of rallies staged by the political opposition
to mark the anniversary. It was the latest step in Hungary's rapid
transition from 41 years of communist rule toward a multi-party
democracy.
   In Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Communist Party newspaper Pravda
today condemned the Hungarian Parliament's reform as ``a political
coup d'etat'' turning Hungary into a ``bourgeois-democratic
republic.''
   More than 1,000 people packed the St. Stephen Basilica in
downtown Budapest and crowded outside the doors earlier today to
hear a Mass and sing hymns for the thousands who fell during the
revolt which began Oct. 23.
   Mothers paraded young girls, whose hair was festooned with
ribbons in the red, white and green national colors, and thousands
of flags flapped in the warm breeze throughout the capital. Police
presence was low-key, with the usual sidearms and truncheons
conspicuously absent from the belts of officers.
   One year ago, thousands of police moved in to block
demonstrations of the the anniversary. The 1956 revolt, in which as
many as 32,000 people died, is now considered a popular uprising
after being condemned as a ``counter-revolution'' abetted from
overseas by dark imperialist forces.
   On that day 33 years ago, mass student demonstrations calling
for greater democracy, a multi-party system and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with Hungarian
and Soviet troops. The revolt ended 12 days later, after Soviet
tanks rumbled into the Hungarian capital and crushed all resistance.
   In the last three historic weeks, the Communist Party was
dismantled and transformed into a Socialist party professing
democratic ideals and Parliament rewrote the constitution to
embrace multi-party democracy ahead of free elections next year.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, in a televised address Sunday evening,
said the parliamentary session marked the closing of ``an era in
our history.''
   He also said Hungarians today would be commemorating the
``sacrifices of 33 years ago.'' He said the anniversary was a
reminder that ``we can never try to erase the past.''
   Szueroes today provisionally assumes the powers of the newly
expanded president until a head of state can be elected either
later this year or after next year's parliamentary elections.
   The new Socialist Party is espousing democratic ideals, though
it will continue in power until the parliamentary elections it has
promised to hold by June. The party issued a statement Friday
rejecting the Soviet intervention that crushed the revolt and
opposing all external intervention or restrictions of sovereignty.
   On June 16, tens of thousands of Hungarians attended the funeral
of Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 revolt, after the government
rehabilitated him. He was formally reburied in the same plot where
his body was dumped in an unmarked grave after his execution for
high treason in 1958.
   Last week, Parliament also summarily exonerated all those tried
for roles in the uprising as well as all those who suffered
reprisals between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially termed
Hungary's Stalinist period.

<HEAD>Walesa New Head of Solidarity Chapter in Lenin Shipyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa promised workers at the Lenin
Shipyard who elected him head of their local Solidarity chapter
that he would mind their interests despite his many other duties, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   Walesa declined an offer to become honorary chairman of the
union chapter at the shipyard where he helped found the independent
Solidarity movement nine years ago and unexpectedly decided to run
for the office Saturday, according to the pro-Solidarity newspaper
Gazeta Wyborcza.
   The electrician defeated Alojzy Szablewski, a veteran shipyard
worker and longtime fellow union activist, by a vote of 87-37.
   ``I don't want honors, I don't want to be artificial, I want to
rule,'' Walesa told the workers, explaining why he did not want to
become only the honorary chairman, according to Gazeta Wyborcza.
   The Solidarity leader is still an employee of the shipyard, but
he has been delegated for union work since Solidarity became legal
again on April 17.
   Walesa served as unofficial chairman of the national Solidarity
organization after the 1980 strikes that led to legalization of the
East bloc's first independent trade union. He was chosen Solidarity
leader at a national congress in Gdansk in 1981.
   Walesa was the elected head of the shipyard chapter until the
national congress when he resigned from that post. Szablewski was
then elected leader of the shipyard chapter and served in that post
until his defeat Saturday.
   Asked whether he would be able to reconcile his new job as head
of the union chapter in the shipyard and his role as national union
leader, Walesa said he would try to keep in permanent contact with
his deputies in the shipyard and promised to visit the workers once
a month.
   After martial law was declared on Dec. 13, 1981, to crush the
union, Walesa guided the movement through nearly eight years of
underground activity and participated in the two strikes at the
shipyard in 1988 that prompted authorities to start a dialogue with
the opposition.
   Two months of talks this spring resulted allowing the
reinstatement of the union and democratic elections in June that
brought victory to the Solidarity-led opposition and paved the way
for a non-communist government.
   Some disgruntled Solidarity members say Walesa has too much
power and want a national congress to be convened as soon as
possible.
   Piotr Konopka, Walesa's spokesman, said Sunday the congress is
likely to be held in the spring, after Solidarity chapters have
chosen their delegates.

<HEAD>Iran Links Western Hostage Release To Iranians Held In Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 8th graf, `The hostages ...' with White
House comment.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani today offered
to help gain freedom for 18 Western hostages in Lebanon if
Washington releases frozen Iranian assets or helps resolve the
cases of three kidnapped Iranians.
   He appeared to refer to Iranians kidnapped by the Lebanese
Forces militia in north Lebanon in 1982, along with their Lebanese
driver, a Shiite Moslem. All four are believed dead.
   Speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreign
reporters, Rafsanjani also ruled out any participation by U.S.
corporations in Iran's post-war reconstruction.
   ``I don't think American companies can play any role in Iran,''
he said.
   Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilinged hall of the
presidential office in downtown Tehran, Rafsanjani spoke in a soft
voice, smiling frequently as he played with a string of worry
beads. His remarks were translated by an interpreter.
   ``If the conditions are right we might be able to do something''
about the abducted Westerners, he said.
   It was not the first time Iran has linked its help in releasing
Western hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release of
the Iranians kidnapped seven years ago.
   The hostages, who include eight Americans, are believed to be
held by pro-Iranian groups. Rafsanjani said hostage-taking is an
``inhuman action'' that can produce no positive political results.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``Our position has not changed. We do not link the Iranian
assets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages.''
   As for Iran's influence over the hostages, Fitzwater said, ``We
have always said we believe that they have an influence on the
hostages, that they have considerable knowledge, but we can't gauge
how specific that is.''
   He said the United States has provided Iran with all the
information it has on Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon.
   Responding to a question from an American reporter, Rafsanjani
said he had proposed ``two methods'' that the United States could
use to facilitate release of the hostages, adding:
   ``The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release our
assets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner or
later you will be forced to do it. So do it now.''
   ``Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at least
you can get your agents, your lackeys in Lebanon to release our
hostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give us
back their bodies or show us their graves.''
   The assets, estimated at more than $1 billion, have been frozen
since students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. Fifty-two
Americans were held hostage there for 444 days.
   The Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 are Ahmad
Motevaselian, commander of the contingent of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon; Iranian Charge
d'Affaires Hussein Musavi; and Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent for
IRNA; along with Rastegar Moqadam, their driver.
   All were kidnapped at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint 25 miles
north of Beirut.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 that
after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the
missing men and blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for their
disappearance and apparent murder.
   Geagea's disclosure was the first formal comment by the Lebanese
Forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing
Iranians. All four men are believed dead.
   Eighteen Westerners are held in Lebanon: eight Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is American journalist Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Meet on Nuclear Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers, grappling with
fast-paced changes in the Soviet bloc, probably will call for a
fresh look at how much nuclear firepower should be kept in Western
arsenals, officials say.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will join defense chiefs of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for two days of nuclear
strategy talks, beginning Tuesday on the southern coast of Portugal.
   ``There are no major decisions required at this meeting,'' said
a senior NATO official. ``The nuclear affairs of the alliance are
running along very smoothly at this time.''
   Another official said: ``It will be a good occasion to take
stock of nuclear matters.'' A third added, ``It's going to be a
rather uneventful meeting, but that's not necessarily a bad
thing.'' All spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The meeting should be free of the tensions marking previous
sessions of the Nuclear Planning Group when U.S. and British
officials clashed mostly with West Germans over development of a
new theater nuclear missile.
   President Bush and other leaders of the 16-nation alliance
resolved the dispute at their 40th anniversary summit in May.
   With that on the backburner, the defense ministers can discuss
the dramatic events shaping East-West relations _ and how they
should react.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner was expected to ``call
attention to the very positive changes'' in the Soviet bloc
countries, said the senior NATO official.
   Another official suggested the ministers urge the Soviet Union
to do more in reducing its nuclear stockpile. Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to pull out 500 short-range
nuclear weapons from Europe this year.
   According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union has 1,450
short-range nuclear missile launchers in Europe. NATO has 88 Lance
launchers, most based in West Germany.
   The ministers also were expected to discuss fresh contacts with
East bloc officials. Cheney met recently with Soviet Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov.
   But it appeared the key outcome would be asking top aides to
make a thorough study of the alliance's nuclear role in an era of
reduced tensions.
   An official said the ministers would likely want ``an
examination of the implications of an agreement on conventional
forces in Europe ... for alliance nuclear forces.''
   NATO negotiators are bargaining with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
in Vienna to reach a quick agreement on sweeping reductions in
conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in Europe.
   ``The positive nature of those (talks) gives us some hope that
we can look forward to a reduction in conventional forces and
subsequent to that a reduction in nuclear forces,'' said the
official. The deeper the conventional cuts, he said, the greater
the impact on NATO's nuclear strategy.
   ``I certainly wouldn't rule out that at some point in the future
we decide certain elements of our nuclear posture are not
necessary,'' he said. ``(But) I think we're going to have to see
some major changes on the other side before that's true.''
   He also said the allies ``see no time in which we will not need
some nuclear weapons.''
   The United States also was expected to bring its allies up to
date on bargaining with the Soviet Union on reducing long-range
nuclear forces.
   Bush and other NATO leaders in May worked out a compromise on
negotiating with Moscow cuts in conventional and nuclear arms in
Europe. The formula links reductions in conventional forces to the
start of talks on trimming short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   West Germany had demanded immediate negotiations with the Warsaw
Pact on slashing theater nuclear missiles. But U.S. and British
officials said attention should be focused first on cutting the
East's enormous superiority in conventional arms.
   They also agreed the question of deploying a new, more powerful
generation of surface-to-surface nuclear missiles would be dealt
with in 1992. The United States had wanted a strong endorsement of
its development program to replace aging Lance missiles. The work
is designed to more than triple the missile's range to just under
the limits of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Defense ministers meet twice a year to discuss nuclear matters.
France, which is outside NATO's integrated military structure, does
not attend. Iceland, which has no armed forces, has observer status.

   Sixty-two Vietnamese refugees arrived in
Singapore after being adrift at sea for 52 days during which they
say their crippled boat was deliberately towed away from Malaysian
waters, refugee officials said today.
   Six of the group died while their boat drifted near Malaysia and
Singapore, according to a statement from the office of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees in Singapore.
   The refugees were brought here by the Greek-owned vessel
Anezina, flying the Cypriot flag, on Sunday, the statement said.
Many had to be assisted, and 12 were taken immediately to Singapore
General Hospital, where one pregnant woman in her thirties remains
in critical condition, it said.
   The woman's 4-year-old daughter was in satisfactory condition,
the statement added.
   Sixty-eight refugees left Cuu Long in southwest Vietnam on Sept.
1 in a 46-foot boat whose engine broke down after three days at sea.
   The refugees reported they survived on rain water, but on Oct.
14 one man died of dehydration and starvation. The next day a
Malaysian vessel spotted the group and brought them water, boiled
rice and vegetables, the report said.
   ``They claim to have been told they would be towed to shore. A
tow rope was attached to their boat and they were towed for
approximately 19 hours. The tow rope was cut without warning and
the boat set adrift,'' the statement said. ``Two more people, a man
and a woman, died of dehydration and starvation.''
   The Anezina rescued them about 75 miles off the coast of Borneo
shortly before another woman died, leaving two young chidren, the
statement said.

<BYLINE>Key Trade Route Reopens After 5 Years of Rebel Sabotage ^By MELINDA
HAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malawi's shortest and cheapest route to
the sea, the Nacala railway line through Mozambique, has reopened
for the first time after five years of rebel sabotage.
   The government has urged Malawi's merchants to reroute external
trade through the Indian ocean port of Nacala, which is only 500
miles from this land-locked country _ a distance three times
shorter than the current route through Durban, South Africa.
   Tobacco, tea and sugar are the main exports likely to be
transported on the Nacala line.
   Tobacco alone earned 60 percent of this impoverished nation's
export income last year.
   No goods have yet traveled on the line, which reopened last
week. But armor-plated locomotives have made test runs since late
May, according to a diplomatic source in the Malawi capital of
Lilongwe.
   Since 1984, Malawi's traditional rail routes to the Indian Ocean
ports of Nacala and Beira have been closed because of repeated
attacks by Mozambique National Resistance guerrillas fighting
against the leftist Frelimo government in Maputo, the capital of
neighboring Mozambique.
   Malawi depended on links through South Africa to carry more than
90 percent of its trade, as well as a new northern route through
Tanzania that carries the remaining traffic.
   Until now, Malawi paid one of the costliest transport bills in
the world, amounting to more than $100 million last year, according
to Finance Minister Louis Chimango.
   The new northern route through Tanzania is being rehabilitated
for $160 million.
   Freight will be transported in stages by road to Lake Malawi,
container vessel across the water, by road again to the Tanzanian
border, and then by the Tazara railway to the port of Dar es Salaam.
   Once the Nacala line is at full steam, it would be able to carry
more than three-quarters of Malawi's trade and cut its transport
bill by two-thirds, said a spokesman for Malawi Railways.
   Since 1983, the nine-nation Southern African Development
Coordination Conference largely has been responsible for restoring
Malawi's lifeline to the sea.
   The regional bloc, which includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, has pledged
to loosen South Africa's traditional stranglehold on their
economies.
   The line is guarded by some 1,000 Malawian soldiers _ a fifth of
the national army _ and an undisclosed number of Frelimo troops.
   Britain, West Germany and the United States are contributing
only small amounts to the development of the line, but their
governments are providing uniforms, trucks and communications
equipment to Malawian troops.

   A strong aftershock Monday hit north China
villages that suffered heavy damage in a series of earthquakes last
week, an official report said, but it did not mention new
casualties.
   The Xinhua News Agency said the aftershock, measuring 5.2 on the
Richter scale, struck in northern Shanxi and Hebei provinces, about
135 miles west of Beijing.
   It said seismologists predicted the aftershock earlier in the
day, but did not say if any precautionary measures were ordered.
Many residents of the area whose homes remained intact after the
earlier quakes had been sleeping outdoors for several nights in
fear of more tremors.
   Xinhua's report did not say if any more buildings collapsed.
About 11,000 homes were reported collapsed in last week's quakes,
leaving 50,000 people homeless. Twenty-nine people were killed.
   The first quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, hit the
area Wednesday night. It was followed in the next 24 hours by five
more registering above 5, including one that measured 6.1.

<TEXT>
   Are you ``healthy and wealthy'' or ``young and
reckless?'' Perhaps ``sedentary but striving'' is a better
description, or ``fat and frustrated.''
   Those are among the categories of Americans developed in a
survey that found middle-aged women with college degrees lead the
healthiest lifestyles, while white, male, blue-collar workers have
the worst health habits.
   The largest group, about 68 million, drink less and exercise
more than the average, but pay little attention to their diet,
according to the report ``The Fit and the Fat.''
   The survey found a sizable group of people who want to be
healthy but lack the resources, both personal and financial, while
many others know what to do to be healthy but lack motivation, said
Thomas Dybdahl, director of the study.
   The study, based on a survey of 1,250 randomly selected
Americans, wder
range of stories.
   Orders against tampering with the successful show led to the
creation of the long-running ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' starring
Robert Young as a general practitioner.
   Victor is survived by his wife, Florence, who was with him when
he died, a daughter, a son and four grandchildren, one of whom is a
physician.

   A New York couple charged in a phony sex
research scheme pleaded guilty to prostitution today and were fined
$2,500 each.
   Rodney Thorp Wood and Nancy Steffen Wood were accused of paying
college men at the University of Oregon to have sex with Ms. Wood
while her husband recorded the encounters and took photographs.
   Ms. Wood, 44, approached young men on the Eugene campus and
claimed she and her 60-year-old husband were conducting research
into the ``sexual potential of the mature female.'' They were cited
by police Sept. 16 at a Eugene hotel.
   The couple entered pleas this morning to one count of
prostitution each. Lane County Circuit Judge Jack Mattison imposed
the sentence recommended by prosecutors and the couple's attorney.
   Wood was suspended as director of anesthesiology at Southampton
Hospital on New York's Long Island after the incident became public.
   Defense attorney Richard Urrutia said this morning that his
clients, who live in Southampton, N.Y., never intended to break the
law. He said they had ``suffered under the extraordinary
sensational press and television coverage.''
   Police said they had evidence the couple intended to carry on
their ``research project'' at other West Coast campuses.

<TEXT>
   With both the PLO and Israel rejecting U.S.
proposals for dialogue, efforts to arrange Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations appear to have reached a low point.
   Among the reasons for the stalemate is the fierce opposition of
hard-liners on both sides, and the lack of strong leadership that
can overcome the resistance.
   ``We are not in an era of great leadership,'' said Avraham Sela,
a political science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
``The problem is that both sides are in a quandary because of
internal politics.''
   Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist, said ``there is no
farsightedness in Israel, not enough statesmanship in the United
States and general apathy in the Arab world.''
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 74, has portrayed
Egyptian and U.S. efforts to bring about talks with Palestinians as
disguised attempts at forcing Israel to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Digging in his heels, Shamir said in a speech last week that
``this is our land from the dawn of history, and it will be so
always. We will not be pushed nor pressured.''
   However, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-leaning
Labor Party today opened fresh debate about the latest American
proposals by saying Israel was considering them despite Shamir's
objections.
   The U.S. proposals ``have not been rejected or accepted. Nobody
has been authorized to accept or reject them,'' Rabin told 500 high
school students in the Tel Aviv suburb of Kfar Sabah, adding that
Washington's latest ideas should be put to a Cabinet vote.
   While Shamir has eased his rhetoric following criticism by the
U.S. State Department, his ability to compromise is limited because
hawks in his own right-wing Likud bloc, led by ex-Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon, have put conditions on his peace proposals.
   The hawks oppose trading land for peace, curtailing the building
of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip or
even starting talks until the 22-month Palestinian uprising has
been put down.
   Part of the reason for a lack of progress, however, also lies in
Shamir himself. He lacks the strength of Likud founder and
ex-Premier Menachem Begin, who arm-wrestled skeptical colleagues
into making peace with Egypt in 1979.
   Shamir is also viewed by some analysts as an inflexible
ideologue who did not support the peace treaty with Egypt and who
does not want to risk getting into any process now that would lead
to yielding land or allowing exiled Palestinians to return.
   ``Shamir sees clearly the eventual result and doesn't want to
get into it. It is not a matter of discussions and proposals,''
said Sela, the political scientist.
   The rival Labor Party advocates negotiations without further
delay. But its leader, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, has lacked
the muscle in his party to force the issue, although there are
hints he may take action if Shamir returns empty-handed from a trip
to Washington next month.
   The internal Palestinian debate is almost as intense as that in
Israel. The only united stand came in Baghdad, Iraq, recently where
PLO leaders rejected U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
compromise proposals as an attempt to circumvent the PLO.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat has spent most of his time battling
hard-liners within his movement rather than assuaging Israeli
doubts about his sincerity in pledging to renounce terror and
accepting the Jewish state.
   Palestinian Islamic fundamentalists have rejected any idea of a
peace agreement, and George Habash, a leading PLO leftist, has
threatened to assassinate Hosni Mubarak if the Egyptian president
continues to promote a Palestinian-Isreli meeting in Cairo.
   The confusing rhetoric from the Palestinian side has failed to
persuade the Israeli in the street of Arafat's sincerity in seeking
peace or his ability to live up to an agreement.
   Hence there is little pressure on Shamir to make concessions or
rein in his own hard-liners.
   Arab countries, with the exception of Egypt, have been silent or
negative about the peace efforts. This has reinforced Israeli
doubts about Arab intentions and has led to bitterness on the part
of Palestinians.
   Saeb Erakat, a leading Palestinian activist and political
scientest at An Najah University in the West Bank, says Arab
countries have failed to provide adequate political or financial
backing to the Palestinians. He says Arab states fear a successful
uprising against Israel could prompt challenges to their own
regimes.
   ``The Arab masses might imitate and revolt against their
regimes. That's why the Arab world does not support the uprising,''
he said.
   The United States also has been the target of criticism from
Palestinians and Israelis for not taking a more active role.
   In an editorial, the Labor-affiliated Davar newspaper said the
proposal to hold Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo about Shamir's
plan for elections in the occupied territories was headed for
failure.
   ``The responsibility for that is mainly with the Americans,''
the newspaper said, predicting a slow slide into violence unless
the Bush Administration stakes its prestige on forcing agreement.

<HEAD>Jurors' Backgrounds Reportedly Probed in Civil Rights Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official on a defunct
segregationist panel says it investigated the backgrounds of jurors
who were selected for a 1964 trial of a man accused of killing
civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   Erle Johnston Jr., the former executive director of the
Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, which spied on civil rights
groups in the 1960s, says that while the review of potential
jurors' backgrounds in the first of two trials ``was unethical ...
it wasn't (jury) tampering.''
   Johnston also said in a newspaper interview Monday there was
nothing in the commission's still-secret records that could be used
if the case were reopened against Byron de La Beckwith, the man
charged with the murder.
   Beckwith was tried twice in 1964 by all-white juries for the
June 12, 1963, slaying of Evers, field secretary of the Mississippi
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. Evers was gunned down outside his Jackson home.
   Both trials ended in deadlocked juries.
   Prosecutors contended that Beckwith's fingerprint was on the
sight of a gun found in bushes near the slaying. Witnesses placed
Beckwith's car near the scene that night.
   A federal judge will decide whether to take action regarding the
findings of an FBI investigation into possible illegal leaks of
materials from Mississippi Sovereignty Commission records.
   The FBI said there was a request by U.S. District Judge William
Barbour Jr. to look into a report that some information may have
been released.
   The segregationist panel was created in 1956 and infiltrated
civil rights groups until its demise in 1973, when then-Gov. Bill
Waller vetoed its funding.
   The 1977 Legislature ordered the commission's files sealed until
2027.
   Barbour ruled this summer that the panel's principal records,
held in a vault at the state Department of Archives and History in
Jackson, should be made public.
   However, the records remain sealed pending an appeal in the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by the Rev. Ed King of Jackson and
John Salter Jr. of Grand Fork, N.D., who are both are mentioned in
the files.
   Johnston's comments to the The Clarion-Ledger Monday came during
an interview about a book he is writing that details the
commission's activities.

   Atlantis' astronauts
swooped out of orbit to a safe, early landing in the Mojave Desert
today after a five-day mission that sent the Galileo spacecraft
streaking across the solar system toward Jupiter.
   Commander Donald Williams and pilot Mike McCulley guided the
97-ton winged spaceship to a stop on a hard clay lakebed runway at
9:33 a.m. PDT, concluding a flight that covered 1.7 million miles.
   They landed into a light headwind of about 8 mph.
   ``Congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' Ken Cameron, a
spacecraft communicator at Mission Control in Houston, told the
shuttle crew. ``You've extended the shuttle's reach to the outer
planets.''
   ``It's nice to be home,'' Williams replied.
   The space travelers remained in the cabin about 45 minutes,
shutting down systems, then made the traditional walkaround
inspection of their spaceship. Except for some minor scratches on
heat protection tiles, the craft looked to be in good shape.
   They rode a van to a nearby building where they showered and
underwent brief medical examinations. They were to fly back to
their training base in Houston later in the day.
   The five astronauts started their descent from orbit an hour
before touchdown when Williams fired Atlantis' braking rockets 180
miles above the Indian Ocean. That slowed the ship's 17,400 mph
speed by 219 mph and started it on a fiery, hourlong dive through
the atmosphere.
   Two sonic booms crackled over the California desert as Atlantis
glided powerless through the clear sky, making wide circles to
reduce speed as it descended.
   Mission Control decided Sunday to shorten the shuttle's trip by
two 90-minute orbits because the calmest winds at Edwards Air Force
Base were predicted early in the day.
   Weather officials said the winds at the time of touchdown were
well within safety limits for a shuttle landing.
   Controllers radioed weather information to the astronauts up to
moment of engine ignition and told them the best wind conditions
were on lakebed runway 23, one of six available at Edwards.
   If the winds had been too strong, the landing could have been
postponed until Tuesday or Wednesday.
   As the five astronauts were ending their journey, the Galileo
probe they dispatched on Wednesday was more than 1 million miles
from Earth on a six-year voyage to explore the mysteries of giant
Jupiter.
   The astronauts adjusted their schedule for the early landing by
going to bed 2{ hours early Sunday night and 90 minutes early the
previous night.
   They were awakened early today to strains of ``Fly Like an
Eagle'' by the Steve Miller Band.
   ``Good morning, Atlantis,'' Mission Control radioed to the craft.
   ``Well I'm not sure we're flying like eagles, but it's been fun
so far,'' Williams replied.
   On Sunday, Williams, who flew a 1985 shuttle mission, described
what today's re-entry would be like.
   ``Re-entry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the
darkness. ... It looks like you're inside a fire looking out,''
Williams said during a television interview from space. He
described the fireball created by the friction created when the
shuttle plunges through the atmosphere.
   Summing up the mission, flight director Bob Castle termed it
``very successful. We had only minor problems with the orbiter; the
science return was very good, and Galileo was released on time.''
   The main goal of the five-day mission was to deploy the
nuclear-powered Galileo, and that was accomplished about 6{ hours
after blastoff Wednesday from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The $1.5 billion probe continued to operate flawlessly as it
raced across the solar system on a 2.4-billion-mile roundabout
journey to Jupiter. Traveling at nearly 9,000 mph, the probe had
logged more than 1 million miles early today.
   ``We all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went
according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the
ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to
do to get on its way,'' astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz said Sunday
during an interview with Cable News Network.
   Also aboard Atlantis were Shannon Lucid and Ellen Baker.
   If all goes according to plan, Galileo will take six years to
reach Jupiter, where it's expected to give the best look yet at
another planet and provide clues to the origin of the universe.
Before it gets there, Galileo will swoop past Venus once and Earth
twice to gain momentum from the planets' gravity for the long
voyage.
   The astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments,
including one that measured the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   Two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and
growing corn plants. The astronauts also photographed lightning
systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student
experiment.
   Time also was spent photographing various parts of the world
with the IMAX movie camera. The footage will be used for a
documentary film about Earth.
   On Sunday, Williams and McCulley successfully tested Atlantis'
flight control systems and fired one of its steering thrusters to
prepare for the trip home.

<HEAD>Chinese Gov't, Dissidents, Turn to East Bloc for Comfort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Condemned by most capitalist countries for
crushing pro-democracy protests, China has turned to the socialist
world for support and comfort. So have its now-silenced protesters.
   Since the June army attack on student-led protesters caused
Japan and the West to halt high-level exchanges, Chinese diplomats
have busied themselves with meetings with East bloc and Third World
envoys.
   Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin visited East Berlin in October
and exchanged condolences with then-East German President Erich
Honecker over their mutual problems from ``imperialist class
opponents.''
   A succession of Soviet and East European scientific, educational
or Communist Party delegations have visited Beijing, many
expressing agreement with China's position that reforms are
intended to strengthen socialism, not topple it.
   But back in the visiting delegations' home capitals, changes are
occurring that can be of little comfort to the Chinese government
but warm the hearts of the dissidents. The widening of perestroika
in the Soviet Union, the rejection of communism in Hungary and
Poland and the mass exodus of East Germans have reinforced some
dissidents' belief that they, not the conservatives, will
eventually prevail.
   ``We are watching what happens very closely,'' said a woman
intellectual who supported China's democracy movment.
   ``There's a tide sweeping the socialist countries, and China
can't shut itself off from it. It can't become isolated again, even
if it tries,'' she said.
   Several former student protesters said the East Europeans'
demand for reform reinforced their beliefs that radical change is
necessary if China is to catch up with the developed world.
   ``It shows that socialism has failed everywhere, not just in
China'' and not just because of China's size and historic
backwardness, said one.
   China's TV news has ignored the East German marches _ dissidents
believe because of the similarities to China's mass protests for
democracy in the spring.
   In both countries, angry populations expressed impatience with
aging, out-of-touch leaders. Both East German and Chinese youth
used visits from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to call for
reforms modeled on Gorbachev's perestroika.
   The Xinhua News Agency, which provides all foreign dispatches,
has carried only a few brief, official East German reports on the
marches.
   Its other reports from the East bloc have created the impression
that old-fashioned, hardline Marxism predominates in the socialist
world.
   Xinhua has quoted East German attacks on the Western media, a
Bulgarian condemnation of Western human rights groups and
Czechoslovakian Communist leader Milos Jakes' pledge to ``never
concede to anti-socialist forces.''
   ``In the Soviet Union, the capitalist road won't do,'' read a
headline in Monday's People's Daily, quoting conservative Politburo
member Yegor Ligachev.
   Other headlines on the same page read, ``Soviet Union's Pravda
warns Western countries: don't plot to rock the socialist boat,''
and ``Yugoslav people's army opposes multiparty rule.''
   Chinese say they follow developments by reading between the
lines of Xinhua reports and listening to Voice of America and BBC
radio reports.
   A Western diplomat said that in internal debates some Chinese
theorists have dusted off the word ``revisionist'' to denounce the
reforms in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary. ``Revisionist''
was the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung's word for the Soviet Union,
which he accused of being too conciliatory toward the West.
   ``There are some arguing that China should come out in the open
and draw attention to the split in the international communist
movement, and that the ones who are faithful should draw
together,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He listed North Korea, Bulgaria and Cuba among the hardline
``faithful.''
   But he predicted that China's current official stance _ that
each socialist country must follow its own road _ will prevail for
practical reasons: snubbed by the West, China cannot afford to snub
its remaining friends.

<HEAD>Rothschild Banking Family Opens German Office After 88-Year Absence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legendary Rothschild banking
family on Monday ended an 88-year absence from Germany by opening a
new office in Frankfurt, the famed Jewish family's historic
hometown.
   The Rothschild family that had lived in this Main River city
since the Middle Ages closed its last German firm in 1901, when
financial activity had migrated elsewhere and family interests in
Paris and London eclipsed those in their traditional home.
   The new Frankfurt office, located at Friedrich Street 48, will
deal primarily in corporate financing, rather than consumer banking.
   Rothschild offices in Paris and London joined forces to open the
new office in Frankfurt, said Jan von Trott, spokesman for
Frankfurt Mayor Volker Hauff.
   Trott said the city views the opening of Frankfurt's new
Rothschild operation as ``a positive signal in connection with
European Economic Community plans for free trade in the community
by 1992.''
   ``It is a joining together of tradition and the future,'' Trott
said. ``The Rothschilds have a magical meaning for Frankfurt as the
original bankers here.''
   Hauff joined Barons Elie and David Rothschild of Paris and
Amschel Rothschild of London in opening ceremonies for the new
office in Frankfurt's West End district.
   The office will initially be staffed by three people under the
supervision of Erich Stromeyer, a former managing director of
Shearson Lehmen Hutton AG in Frankfurt.
   Plans call for the office's activities to include business
mergers and acquisitions, in addition to regular portfolio
management, banking sources say.
   Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the son of a Jewish money-changer in
the Frankfurt ghetto, started the family financial empire in the
18th century.
   The Rothschild family later expanded its banking business to
other major cities, including London, Vienna, Naples and Paris.
   Berlin eventually became Germany's banking center, and in 1901,
when Baron Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild died leaving no male heirs,
the family closed its operations in Frankfurt.
   ``For a Rothschild family member, the return to Frankfurt is a
meaningful event,'' Baron David Rothschild, associated manager of
Rothschild &amp; Cie. in Paris, told reporters at a press conference.
   The Frankfurt office is owned by N.M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd. in
London, Rothschild Bank AG of Zurich, and the Paris-based
Rothschild &amp; Cie.
   The Rothschild family gained prominence by financing such
projects as the construction of European railroads and the British
military campaign that led to the final defeat of Napoleon at
Waterloo in 1815.
   The family's original home on the banks of the Main River was
destroyed by Allied bombers in World War II.
   In November 1988, West Germany's only museum devoted exclusively
to Jewish life and culture opened in the restored Rothschild
Palace. Exhibits range from Jewish traditions in the city to
documentation of the horrors of the Holocaust that claimed the
lives of 6 million European Jews.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt had planned a
party this fall in the heart of her city. But now's not the time
for revelry _ rubble and ruin surround her.
   The downtown of this coastal community is littered with caved-in
buildings, shattered windows and piles of brick _ stark tesimony to
15 seconds of nature's fury.
   One week ago, the earthquake struck Santa Cruz, but if the shock
is over, the painful reality is just settling in for the mayor.
   ``It's really hard and gets harder each time I see it,'' she
said, her eyes brimming with tears as she surveyed the ravaged
Pacific Garden Mall, the downtown business district.
   ``This week people are really taking care of each other,'' she
said. ``Next week, we're not the media's favorite, their 15-second
sound bite. Everyone will go away. And we'll settle in the long
haul putting it back together.''
   Rebuilding is a far cry from what this community of 50,000 had
planned for this fall. In a few weeks, Santa Cruz was supposed to
be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the mall, several blocks of
shops and offices in renovated wood and stucco buildings.
   ``This was a dying downtown, this was a downtown that had lost
its vitality,'' the mayor said. ``People had creativity and
vsion,'' rebuilding and renovatng, adding greenery and
pedestrian-only areas, benches and outdoor cafes.
   Instead of celebrating, the city is mourning the three people
who died here a week ago and trying to assess the damage. Thirty
percent of the stores may be lost in this business district, part
of which is cordoned off with yellow police tape.
   That's just part of the devastation. Total quake damage in Santa
Cruz has been estimated at $160 million _ about two-thirds of it
private property.
   Still, the mayor _ serving a rotating one-year term from City
Council _ is confident the city can rebound and the business core
can be rebuilt. But she said timing is critical.
   ``It's going to take massive infusion of assistance from every
level of government to get the city back on its feet again,'' she
said. ``If that help isn't immediate, it's not going to do any
good. These are people that can't stay shut six to 12 months. It's
got to be now.''
   The mayor conveyed that message to President Bush and Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who made separate trips to
Santa Cruz in recent days.
   Business leaders are already talking about setting up temporary
headquarters for merchants. ``There's a lot more cooperative spirit
then there was on Monday,'' the day before the quake, said Louie
Rittenhouse, president of the Downtown Association of Santa Cruz.
``Everybody has put their other problems behind them.''
   But anxiety remains, especially among some small merchants near
the mall. ``We were a flea on the hide of the elephant,'' Lillian
Smith Kaiser said to explain her used bookstore's relationship to
the mall. ``Now the elephant's gone. Will people come back? What
will they come back to?''
   The mall, along with the wharf, beach and boardwalk, are among
the many attractions in a community that evokes images of the '60s.
It's not uncommon to see pony-tailed men in tie-dyed shirts or a
rainbow-painted Volkswagen bus cruising the streets.
   ``We're a time-warped kind of town,'' said resident Russell Kane.
   It's also a university community, with the University of
California at Santa Cruz, and politically active.
   ``There's a protest going on all the time here,'' said Joyce
Ulrich. ``Whatever your cause is, it's OK.''
   And the mall was not only the business core, but a social
congregating spot.
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said Laura Martin. ``Some of us will be
forced into a totally new lifestyle.''
   ``It certainly will never be the same, all those wonderful
little stores,'' said Smith Kaiser. ``The old lady won't be
recognizable anymore. She'll get a new dress.''
   But that's not necessarily bad, said Rittenhouse, who lost four
buildings in the quake.
   ``The mall,'' he said, ``is going to come back bigger and
better. The majority of them (merchants) are pretty tough people.
They're already saying tell us when we can come in to pick up the
pieces so we can start over again.''

   Former President Richard M. Nixon will visit
China around the end of the month, meeting with Chinese leaders and
reporting to President Bush on his return, a spokesman said Monday.
The White House said Bush looks forward to the report.
   Nixon spokesman John H. Taylor said in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., the
visit to Beijing had been delayed because of the deadly crackdown
on pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.
   For security reasons, Taylor said, Nixon's precise travel plans
were not disclosed.
   Bush banned high-level U.S. contact with the Beijing government
after the violence last spring. But that action does not apply to
trips such as Nixon's since he is not representing the U.S.
government, said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``While the former president is traveling as a private citizen,
President Bush looks forward to hearing his assessment of the
situation in China when he returns,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said that Nixon had discussed his upcoming visit with
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   The trip will be Nixon's sixth since, as president, he re-opened
U.S. relations with the People's Republic of China in 1972.
   Nixon's spokesman, Taylor, said, ``He will give his assessment
of the leaders, their policies and Chinese-American relations in
general in writing to President Bush upon his return.''
   Taylor described the visit as ``solely a fact-finding trip''
with no sightseeing or social events.

<TEXT>
   Leggy fashions with a light-as-air appeal took over
in summer ready-to-wear shows Monday by fashion heavyweights Karl
Lagerfeld at Chanel and Gianfranco Ferre at Dior.
   Luxury fabrics and curvy silhouettes are ruling the runways as
strong silhouettes are bowing to the feminine appeal of bows and
softness.
   Lagerfeld turned the Chanel woman into a young girl with a raft
of flared shorts, tiny skirts, beautiful fitted long or short
jackets, and some asymmetrical draping to vary the menu.
   It was all a shadow game of black and white, pepped up by
pastels and some hot-color prints, as Lagerfeld played with a
girlish silhouette, outlining typically Chanel jackets in black
passementerie piping.
   He led off with a transparent-opaque contrast in asymmetrically
draped chiffon skirts under piped white jackets, later varying the
idea with transparent duster jackets over V-necked tunics and
micro-minis.
   This coy idea of pairing see-throughs with solids is a solid hit
in most Paris collections, and most beautifully done at Chanel.
   Some of the jacket ideas rich women will want to wear or copy
include tulip or decollete shapes done up with seed pearl patch
pockets and piping _ or sexier versions in black satin with
jet-bead trim and chains at the waist.
   The youth kick here means that the newest Chanel bag is worn as
a chic biker's pouch on a belt. The regular chain belt has become a
bold hip chain with huge links.
   The older Chanel client shouldn't panic. There's lots of choice,
especially in the ivory and white suits that don't have to be worn
open to show the bosom.
   Lagerfeld also offered soft, semi-transparent blouses with
floppy bows or deep-draped decolletes and dozens of lovely, long
pajamas.
   Gianfranco Ferre's first ready-to-wear collection for Dior also
was a symphony in grays, black and white, beginning with
tiny-checked suits and flared shortie coats.
   He too showed shorts, but topped them with billowy chiffon
babydoll jackets, raincoats and artists' smock tops.
   The Ferre signature big bow here became so outsized in organza
and taffeta that it made the strong silhouette of the outfits.
   The gift blouses were off-shoulder organza with big puffed
sleeves, or a fitted lace version, with black linen shorts or long
pants.
   The youth kick here became black workout suits, with black
leather jackets, or with ruffled wraparound stoles and skirts for
evening.
   Color finally came out at Dior in shades of periwinkle blue with
polka dots, plus some fitted linen or silk tulip jackets in tomato,
bright yellow and violet, often over black pants.
   For informal beachwear, Ferre offered bikinis and one-piece
ivory or off-white maillot swimsuits topped with terrycloth.
   Like Angelo Tarlazzi, he also used some hemstitched,
handkerchief-draped outfits right out of the linen closet.
   Designer Hanae Mori celebrated her 35 years in the industry with
fashions that look younger than ever. Last week she became a Knight
of the Legion of Honor for her years as a member of the Chambre
Syndicale, the powerful fashion association.
   Her sportier clothes were excellent in some soft day wear, with
short skirts, wide shorts, long and flared skirts in striped
chiffons with a Deauville regatta appeal.
   Her gray and white cloud prints and graphic Kabuki faces on
billowy kimono tops nevertheless didn't hide the female form. It
came out in fitted bustier trouser suits and fitted suits with
skirts above the knee _ younger than Mori's usual styles.
   She too went overboard for bows. She put her signature butterfly
bow on piped, colorful or navy linen suits, then the bow turned
giant on layers of chiffon in two colors for an iridescent evening
effect.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Says Nobel Prize Will Help His People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TSETEN SAMDUP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama said Monday he will
remain ``a simple Buddhist monk'' despite winning the 1989 Nobel
Peace Prize, but it will make the world more aware of the Tibetan
struggle against Chinese rule.
   ``I will not be a different person,'' the Tibetan spiritual and
temporal leader said at his first public address since returning to
his exile home in Dharmsala after the Nobel Prize was announced
Oct. 5. ``I will remain the same galong (Buddhist monk), Tenzin
Gyatso, whether someone curses or praises me.''
   He told a crowd of 4,000 Tibetans celebrating the 29th
anniversary of the Tibetan Children's Village that the Nobel Prize
would make the Tibetan cause better known.
   ``Tibetans in Tibet today are undergoing a very difficult period
in Tibet's modern history,'' the Dalai Lama said. ``Martial law
continues in Lhasa and hundreds of Tibetans have been arrested and
and equal number have been killed.''
   The children's village, sprawling across a rocky ridge in the
Himalayan foothills, is home for 1,700 Tibetan children, including
about 500 who have been smuggled out of Tibet in recent years to
live in the Tibetan culture their parents fear will be denied them
under Chinese rule.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India 30 years ago when Chinese troops
surrounded his palace in Lhasa after a failed Tibetan uprising. His
followers set up a government-in-exile in Dharmsala, 300 miles
north of New Delhi.
   The Beijing government, which claims Tibet is an ancient and
integral part of China, has denounced the awarding of the Nobel
Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama as interference in China's internal
affairs. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile say
Tibet was a separate and independent state before Chinese troops
arrived in 1950.

<HEAD>Wilder's Campaign Avoids Jackson, Civil Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is striving to
be the nation's first elected black governor, but has avoided
emphasizing his race in a campaign without even a drive to register
black voters.
   The 58-year-old Democrat who grew up in the segregated South has
conducted a campaign designed to appeal to the moderate, urban
voters who helped put him in the state's No. 2 office in 1985, when
he got 44 percent of the white vote.
   But he showed a rare moment of anger on a matter close to the
hearts of black voters last week when his Republican opponent, J.
Marshall Coleman, invoked the name of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. in a televised debate.
   Wilder told Coleman, a 47-year-old former state attorney
general, that the late Gov. John Dalton cast a veto ``that you
encouraged'' of a bill to create a holiday honoring King. Wilder
pushed for years for a King state holiday.
   On Monday, at a rally at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, Wilder criticized a Coleman proposal to limit
out-of-state admissions to 10 percent at state-supported
universities and colleges.
   ``This university's richness and diversity are a result of
people coming from all over the world,'' Wilder told about 250
students at the rally.
   For the most part, Wilder's political success has been built on
a mixture of playing by the rules of the mostly white power
structure while challenging the establishment on occasion.
   Wilder played little part in the civil rights movement that
divided his home state in the 1950s and '60s. He has stayed away
from national black leaders such as Jesse Jackson, winner of
Virginia's 1988 presidential primary.
   Wilder did not endorse Jackson, and Jackson has not been invited
to campaign here this year on his behalf. ``I'm running a Virginia
campaign,'' Wilder said, a comment directed at President Bush's two
campaign trips to the state to support Coleman.
   When he first ran for the state Senate in 1969, Wilder was
chiefly known only as a criminal trial lawyer in Richmond. But he
became a symbol to Richmond blacks, defeating two white candidates
and taking the oath as the first black member of the chamber since
Reconstruction.
   About 17 percent of the state's 2.7 million voters are black.
   Wilder allied himself with a group of younger Democrats who were
about to overthrow the old-line conservative leaders in the Senate.
Eventually he rose to chairman of four committees, including the
powerful Rules panel, which makes committee assignments.
   He became identified with the King holiday bill, which
eventually became law, and an unsuccessful effort to change the
state song, ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia,'' because of racially
offensive lyrics.
   Sometimes, Wilder turned against his allies. In 1982, he
single-handedly scuttled the U.S. Senate candidacy of Owen B.
Pickett, who was then-Gov. Charles S. Robb's choice for the
nomination.
   Pickett offended Wilder by praising the two men who held the
seat for a half-century: Harry F. Byrd Sr. and Harry F. Byrd Jr.,
whose legacy included resistance to school integration.
   Robb released a series of letters in 1986 in which the former
governor, now a U.S. senator, accused Wilder of being ungrateful
and unreliable. He took the action after Wilder's top aides said
Robb was getting too much credit for Wilder's 1985 victory.
   ``We've had differences and we've had serious differences,''
Robb said. ``But notwithstanding that, I'm still in Doug's corner.''
   Still, Robb has criticized both campaigns this year for focusing
too much on abortion.
   Coleman, who has used the Robb-Wilder feuds as fuel in his
campaign, said the abortion criticism was directed at Wilder, who
has run television ads that point out Coleman's anti-abortion views.
   A Wilder aide disagreed with Robb, saying voters consider the
issue important.
   But Wilder scarcely mentioned abortion in the debate last week.
   Coleman won the endorsement Sunday of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, a week after Wilder got the nod from The Washington
Post.

<HEAD>ANC Leaders Hold Strategy Meeting, Unhindered by Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight African National
Congress leaders, including seven freed from prison this month,
held a strategy meeting Monday, unhindered by police even though
their movement remains outlawed.
   A statement issued after the meeting said the men would consult
with exiled officials of the ANC and would address policy issues
Sunday at a mass rally at a soccer stadium near Johannesburg.
   The meeting marked a reunion for the seven recently released men
and a colleague, Govan Mbeki, who was freed from prison in 1987.
   Mbeki, 79, has been barred from traveling and attending
political gatherings since his release, but the government Sunday
lifted the restrictions for one week. He flew to Johannesburg on
Monday from his hometown of Port Elizabeth.
   The other seven were released unconditionally and have spoken
out freely on behalf of their guerrilla movement. They have
endorsed the ANC's use of violence as part of its campaign to end
white-minority domination and have demanded a series of concessions
from the government as a precondition for negotiations.
   The eight men met with other anti-apartheid leaders for more
than three hours behind closed doors at a community center in
Soweto. They engaged in ``an in-depth exploration of the way
forward,'' according to a statement issued by a coalition of
activists.
   Mbeki and five of those freed this month received life sentences
in 1964, along with paramount ANC leader Nelson Mandela, after
being convicted of treason for planning anti-government sabotage.
Mandela remains imprisoned, although the government is considering
his release.
   His freed co-defendants include Walter Sisulu, 77; Andrew
Mlangeni, 63; Raymond Mhlaba, 68; Ahmed Kathrada, 60; and Elias
Motsaoledi, 65.
   Also released Oct. 15 and present at Monday's meeting were
Wilton Mkwayi, 66, convicted of sabotage in a separate 1964 trial,
and Oscar Mpetha, 80, who began a five-year sentence for terrorism
in 1985.
   The unconditional release of the ANC leaders and the
government's decision to allow Sunday's rally have been depicted by
South African newspapers as a de facto legalization of the movement.
   Government officials have made clear in recent days they no
longer expect the ANC to make a formal repudiation of violence as a
precondition for joining negotiations. President F.W. de Klerk said
Monday that groups such as the ANC group could join the political
process by committing themselves to the concept of peaceful
solutions.
   ``If perspective participants in the negotiation process insist
on victories before entering negotiations, success will evade us,''
he told a party congress. ``What is necessary is a change of
heart.''
   He said the ANC, if it distanced itself from violence, could
help achieve its demand for lifting of the state of emergency.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution that will
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority. He
envisions a system which stops short of one-person, one-vote and
provides whites with some type of veto power over major policy
decisions.

   The U.S. Postal Service has decided to start
selling picture postal cards for the first time, entering a
business private firms have found lucrative for decades.
   The government agency will issue only a few cards, however. It
says it doesn't plan on jumping into the market to compete
nationwide for sales of the cards that are tourist favorites,
bearing beautiful photos of local attractions in cities across the
land, to make the folks back home envious.
   But visitors to Washington, and others interested in Washington
landmarks, will be able to purchase two official government picture
postal cards featuring the White House and the Jefferson Memorial.
   The White House card will go on sale Nov. 30 and the Jefferson
Memorial card Dec. 2, both being issued in Washington. The cards
will sell for 50 cents apiece which includes 15-cents postage.
   The government has sold plain postal cards for years, of course,
and recently many have carried colorful commemorative designs in
the corner. The new cards merely expand that to photos filling one
side of the card.
   Privately made cards will remain on sale, of course.
   Buyers will still have a wide choice of post cards featuring
many different photos of the White House and Jefferson Memorial.
The difference will be that the two postal cards, sold by the
government, include the 15-cent postage already printed on the
card, while a stamp has to be added to privately produced cards.

<TEXT>
   Workers raced ahead of a storm Monday to
lower a 100-ton section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to
a barge, but then suffered a frustrating delay when choppy seas
kept the barge from moving to shore.
   A portion of the troubled bridge over troubled water collapsed
like a trap door in Tuesday's earthquake, closing it to the 260,000
vehicles that cross it each day.
   Engineers could not get a close-up look at the damaged sections
Monday morning because the rain and high wind that wracked the Bay
area forced the barge to cling to a Bay Bridge tower for safety,
said Jim Larson of the California Department of Transportation.
   Officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the road section.
   ``This is a very key element in this whole transportation system
in the Bay Area,'' said department spokesman Bob Halligan. ``It is
incumbent to get it open in a minimum time.''
   Repair time for the double-decked bridge remains about four
weeks, but Transportation Department officials admitted Monday that
the target was largely a motivational tool.
   ``If we put a goal of three months it would be three months,''
Halligan said.
   The department set a Nov. 16 goal for the reopening, but the
work may take longer, perhaps six weeks, he said. It is expected to
cost $1 million.
   There has been considerable skepticism about the department's
repair prediction, with some officials of other agencies estimating
the work would take several months.
   Without the bridge, thousands of commuters are forced onto other
jam-packed bridges or to use public transportation.
   Transportation Department officials also expressed satisfaction
at the decision to remove a 100-ton slab from the bridge in the
dark early Monday, just a few hours before a storm struck the Bay
area. The wind and rain would have prevented the dangerous and
delicate work later, Halligan said.
   A portion of the upper level, 50 feet long and five lanes
across, had been sawed in half to make it easier to remove. The
first half was lowered 200 feet to the barge on Sunday afternoon,
and then a crane had to be moved to the other side of the bridge
and set up again for the second half.
   For 53 years, the 8.5-mile-long bridge has been the main link
between Oakland and San Francisco. Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude
earthquake dislodged a portion of the upper deck and sent it
slamming onto the lower portion.
   The lower section is considered destroyed and will have to be
removed and replaced, officials have said.
   Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge provided the
first graphic illustration of the magnitude of Tuesday's quake.
   The bridge also had been a symbol for the 1989 World Series
between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics. But its
closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the
seven-game baseball championship until Friday.

   Families who have lost loved ones in terrorist
attacks gathered Monday to pray for peace on the sixth anniversary
of the devastating bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon.
   ``Terrorist acts ... can never be justified, can never be
condoned,'' said Ambassador Morris D. Busby, the State Department's
top counter-terrorism official.
   Busby placed a remembrance wreath at Arlington National
Cemetery, where the ceremony was held under brilliantly sunny skies.
   Many of the participants wore buttons inscribed with ``Beirut
Connection,'' signifying they had lost friends of relatives in the
terrorist attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983.
   Joan Muffler's son, John, was one of the 241 servicemen killed
when a suicide bomber drove a bomb-laden truck crashed through the
barracks' gates. Fundamentalist Shiites claimed responsibility.
   Mrs. Muffler, a Philadelphia resident, said families stay in
touch with each other through a three-times-a-year newsletter.
   ``The pain is still fresh,'' said Aphrodite Tsaris, whose
daughter, Alexis, died when a bomb exploded on Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland last December.
   But the incident has given the victims ``a renewed resolve to
effect change,'' replacing terrorism with peace, she said.
   The event was sponsored by No Greater Love, a non-profit,
humanitarian organization that tries to help the victims of
terrorism.

   A decision by Lithuania to make it harder

   The restrictions could further strain relations between the East

   Some Poles have voiced concern about the treatment of the ethnic
Polish minority in Lithuania, while Lithuania holds bitter memories
of historic Polish dominance, including a 1920 invasion in which
Poland seized Lithuania's capital of Vilnius and held it until 1939.
   The current dispute, while economic in origin, underscores how
the decline of strict Communist Party control in Eastern Europe is
allowing repressed nationalist tensions to emerge.
   Under the restrictions announced by the Lithuanian Council of
Ministers on Friday, Poles and other East bloc residents are
allowed only one visit to Lithuania a year, visitors are barred
from mailing parcels to Poland, currency must be changed to rubles
when entering Lithuania, and regular train service between Vilnius
and Warsaw is down to once a day.
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza ran a dispatch on
the restrictions under the headline, ``Stop Tourist.''
   The communist youth newspaper Sztandar Mlodych asked Monday that
Poland's Foreign Ministry take ``quick diplomatic action.''
   ``Erecting at our borders more and more obstructive barriers ...
represents a kind of political schizophrenia,'' it said.
   ``The resolution ... simultaneously causes surprise and alarm,''
it said. ``This is another in a long list of decisions of various
socialist countries limiting for economic pseudo-reasons the
freedom of travel between the countries of Eastern Europe.''
   The newspaper said the decision clearly was directed at Poland.
The rules about parcels and train service mention Poland
specifically, it noted, and the number of visitors from all other
East bloc countries together is less than half the number that come
from Poland annually.
   Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski and
consular department officials declined to comment Monday.
   Lithuania said it was taking the action to prevent goods on its
domestic market from being bought out by visitors. Throughout the
Soviet Union many goods, ranging from tea, to school composition
books to meat are running short because of the country's economic
difficulties.
   Many Poles active as black-market traders are expert at finding
goods in neighboring countries that can be bought cheaply and sold
at home or elsewhere in the East bloc.
   Aside from traders, however, the restrictions will strike hard
at Poles who visit friends and relatives on the Soviet side of the
border.
   About 8 percent of Lithuania's 3.5 million population, or about
280,000 people, are ethnic Poles _ concentrated along the border,
in Vilnius and in Salcininkai, in southern Lithuania. Last month
the district of Salcininkai, where Poles are dominant, even
declared it wanted to be treated as an autonomous Polish region.
   Poland and Lithuania were allied from the 14th century on
through the Jagiellonian dynasty, and then formed a joint
commonwealth from 1569 until 1795 when Lithuania and most of Poland
succumbed to Russian rule.
   Over the centuries, the gentry in Lithuanian became
Polish-speaking while the peasantry spoke Lithuanian, the country's
native Baltic language. But in the late 19th century, a Lithuanian
nationalist movement emerged aimed at fighting Polish cultural and
Russian political domination.
   For most of the period between the world wars, the newly
independent Polish and Lithuanian states were at war or in a tense
truce because of conflicting territorial claims.
   But in September 1939, both Lithuania and eastern Poland were
occupied by the Soviet Union. Poland regained statehood within the
Soviet orbit after World War II, but Lithuania remained a Soviet
republic after having been incorporated into the Soviet Union in
1940.
   In the past year, the Solidarity movement in Poland and the
Sajudis movement in Lithuania have expressed support for one
another in their parallel efforts to increase independence from
Moscow.
   The border restrictions are ``clear proof that politicians
linked to Solidarity were wrong'' to support Sajudis rather than
the pro-Polish Union of Poles in Lithuania, Sztandar Mlodych said.

   A flotilla of ferries and extra trains
helped keep rain-soaked traffic moving today, but only at a
bumper-to-bumper pace. Rescuers halted the search for survivors at
an earthquake-flattened freeway when the rubble became too unstable.
   And hospital officials said today survivor Buck Helm had
improved and they were considering upgrading his condition from
critical to very serious. Doctors said he was no longer in pain,
and they were hopeful the longshoreman pulled from the freeway
rubble would not have permanent kidney problems.
   ``In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now,
he will be out of the woods,'' Dr. Floyd Huen said.
   The death toll rose to 61 today with the recovery of two more
bodies in San Francisco, the coronor's office said. A female body
was found in the remains of a Marina district fire, and a
68-year-old woman died of injuries suffered from the quake near
downtown. Dozens remained missing and thousands were injured and
homeless.
   At the Interstate 880 disaster in Oakland, where 38 bodies have
been recovered, officials said today crews began dismantling a
100-yard section of the double-deck freeway that was near collapse.
   ``It is a dangerous operation,'' said Kyle Nelson, a spokesman
for the California Department of Transportation.
   Congress began putting together a $3 billion-plus package of
federal disaster, but put off until later how to come up with the
money to pay for it.
   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., told the Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee on transporation and resources.
   Gale warnings were posted early today, rain was heavy in some
areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the
San Francisco Bay, authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, the
terminus of all ferries when they reach San Francisco, was closed
for an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to a
pier about a mile away.
   But most made it to work without major problem, despite
predictions of commuter gridlock on the first full workday since
the earthquke closed crucial freeways and broke a section of the
vital Bay Bridge linking San Francisco and Oakland.
   ``Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,''
said Maggie Faulkner of Oakland, who rode a ferry across the choppy
bay to San Francisco.
   Highway 101 was a sea of lights starting shortly after 5 a.m.
PDT and the Golden Gate Bridge was bumper-to-bumper but moving. Bay
Area Rapid Transit, which runs trains underneath the bay, had
carried 70,000 passengers by 8:30 a.m., more than double the normal
load.
   Damage estimates from Tuesday's earthquake topped $7 billion,
eclipsing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in U.S.
history, according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
   On Sunday, 150 residents of a housing project just 10 feet from
collapsed I-880 joined thousands of homeless because of fears that
more of the highway could fall.
   The unstable ruins forced authorities to halt rescue work late
Sunday.
   ``We know there are more victims, more cars. But we don't know
how many,'' said California Highway Patrol Capt. Mike Garver,
speaking about I-880.
   There was no estimate of when work could resume.
   ``It's kind of minute by minute,'' said Nelson.
   The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers
sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves
200 feet by crane Sunday to a barge on wind-whipped San Francisco
Bay.
   Without the Bay Bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced
to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the
most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs
will take at least four weeks.
   ``You just can't squeeze all the traffic onto other bridges.
There just isn't enough room,'' said Joel Markowitz, a traffic
planner with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. ``We're
going to have a crisis until people adapt a little.''
   Traffic planners took extraordinary precautions to avoid
rush-hour paralysis on the first full workday since the earthquake.
   Commuters were urged to take public transportation, buddy up in
carpools and come in earlier or later than normal. Fourteen ferries
were added to ease the bridge crisis, and extra police and tow
trucks were placedin choke zones in case something goes wrong.
   About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the
nine-county region. Authorities warned that 2 million of them could
be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course.
   MTC Chairman Rod Diridon said any motorist driving alone would
be ``doing an anti-social act.''
   Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional
45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic
that normally crosses the 8.5-mile-long Bay Bridge.
   Other freeways also are devastated. A 1\-mile section of I-880
is flattened, and the Embarcadero Freeway and the I-280 extension
are closed. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open
only to buses and emergency vehicles.
   The hospital where Helm was taken was deluged with flowers,
telegrams and phone calls for a survivor who had been given up for
dead.
   Helm, 57, regained some functions in his kidneys, which were
damaged by dehydration during his 89-hour ordeal. He was also
breathing better, but he was still having trouble moving his leg
and was being fed by a tube in intensive care, said officials at
Oakland's Highland General Hospital.
   Highway engineer Steven Whipple, the hero who found Helm, said
he was checking the ruins for stability when he spotted the back of
Helm's head and a slight movement in his flashlight's beam.
   ``It stopped my heart,'' said Whipple, 29, who works for the
state transportation department.
   In six subsequent sweeps of the section, sniffing dogs and
sensitive listening devices failed to detect any more survivors.
   Rescuers were clearly buoyed at finding someone alive after four
grisly days of removing bodies and crushed cars from the crumpled
concrete. They placed giant airbags, hydraulic jacks and wooden
timbers under concrete slabs and trucked in dirt to firm the
foundation. They also installed seismic monitors on the structure.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday reported
major cracks in three dams within five miles of the epicenter in
the Santa Cruz Mountains, but said they posed ``no public threat at
this time'' because water is low behind them.
   A half-dozen tent cities have sprouted in Watsonville, a city of
30,000 about 80 miles south of San Francisco. Many residents were
so frightened by the quake and its aftershocks that they refuse to
go indoors, even if their homes have been declared safe.
   The Red Cross even opened a full-blown shelter of olive-green
military tents, complete with medical and feeding facilities, in
the battered community.
   Resumption of the World Series, the first ever between the two
Bay area teams, was pushed back until Friday. It had been hoped
play would resume three days earlier.
   Football was played Sunday, but not in San Francisco. The 49ers
beat the New England Patriots 37-20 in a game moved from
Candlestick Park to Stanford University, and a collection was taken
among the 75,000 fans for earthquake victims. A moment of silence
honored the dead.
   Throughout the region, Sunday was a time for mourning the dead
and giving thanks for survival.
   ``We pray to be spared from further suffering,'' Archbishop John
Quinn told 700 worshipers at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.
``I pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety. I cannot forget
to pray for the dead and the bereaved.''
   In Oakland, parishioners of the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral
held services in a Baptist church because their tower had been
cracked and leaned precariously.
   ``Sometimes in life, God shakes us and says, `Pay attention,
there is something more important than the ordinary things in our
lives,'' the Rev. Joseph Powers said.

<HEAD>Rightist Extremists Make Strong Showing in Municipal Elections</HEAD>

   Rightist extremists won six
Stuttgart city council seats and garnered more than 10 percent of
the vote in several other municipal elections in the southern state
of Baden-Wuerttemberg, officials said Monday.
   The successes in Sunday's balloting, at the cost of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union, were the
latest in a series of strong showings by the party led by former
Nazi Waffen SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.
   Schoenhuber said the Republicans will make an all-out effort to
win seats in the federal Parliament in Bonn in national elections
in December 1990.
   ``I am convinced that the party will be represented with at
least 10 percent of the vote,'' Schoenhuber said in Munich.
However, several public opinion polls have indicated the
Republicans may not reach the 5 percent hurdle needed to gain any
parliamentary seats in Bonn.
   The Republicans have run on a platform of law-and-order, want to
slash the number of foreign workers to combat unemployment running
at about 9 percent, and have blamed established parties for a
growing housing shortage.
   Leftist protesters demonstrated Sunday night in Stuttgart and
stormed city hall in Karlsruhe, where the Republicans won 6.9
percent of the vote to gain about four out of the 60 city council
seats. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   The Republicans already have 11 of the 138 seats in the West
Berlin legislature, as well as seats in city councils in major
cities such as Duesseldorf, Cologne and Dortmund and in parts of
Hesse state.
   Under West Germany's complicated election laws, the Republicans
in West Berlin will send two non-voting members to the Parliament
in Bonn after the 1990 elections, based on the results in the
western part of the divided city.
   Their 7.1 percent of the vote in June gave the Republicans six
seats in the European Parliament and made them eligible for federal
campaign funds from Bonn.
   An angry Mayor Manfred Rommel of Stuttgart vowed that he and his
Christian Democrats will have nothing to do with the Republicans in
city hall.
   ``The Republicans won't improve anything. They will just make
politics more difficult,'' Rommel said after the polls had closed.
   Officials initially had said that the Republicans' 9.6 percent
of the vote would give the party five of the 60 city council seats,
but late Monday said the number would be six under a complicated
apportioning system.
   The Christian Democrats' share of the vote Stuttgart fell from
38.8 percent to 33.1 percent, although Rommel will remain head of
the local government.
   Republican candidates did even better in other key cities in
West Germany's richest state, including 10.6 percent in Heilbronn,
11.9 percent in Pforzheim and 14.2 percent in Heidenheim. The party
even picked up a seat on the city council in the traditional
leftist stronghold of Freiburg.
   It was the first time the Republicans had won seats in
Baden-Wuerttemberg. The party, founded in 1983, was virtually
unrepresented in the state's last municipal elections, held the
following year.
   The results are expected to put further pressure on Chancellor
Kohl's party, which lost more than five percentage points of its
share of the vote in Stuttgart and the state's other largest cities.
   Kohl's party has been buffeted by ultra-conservatives calling
for a tougher stance to win back voters from the Republicans, while
the left has accused the Christian Democratic Union of already
making too many concessions to the far right.

   Police and volunteers answered dozens of emergency
calls Monday after a pay dispute involving ambulance drivers and
attendants shut down most ambulance stations in London, officials
said.
   Police helped a heart attack victim, women in labor and people
who had suffered minor injuries, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. In
all, more than 50 calls were answered.
   ``It looks like we're not really encountering too many
difficulties and we're coping OK,'' he said.
   Police converted about 30 vans into temporary ambulances
carrying stretchers, first-aid kits and oxygen, and staffed by
officers trained in first aid. But the officers were not qualified
to administer drugs intravenously or operate defibrillators used to
stimulate the heart.
   Ambulance workers have refused to work overtime for the past
five weeks and have rejected a 6.5 percent pay offer, demanding
instead an 11.5 percent raise. London ambulance workers with five
years' seniority are paid $16,906 a year.
   The workers' unions said they were ready to answer emergency
calls, but ambulance chiefs decided to suspend employees without
pay when they refused to handle other routine duties.
   Suspended crews then staged sit-ins at their stations, said the
unions' chief negotiator, Roger Poole.
   The pay dispute paralyzed 62 of London's 71 ambulance stations,
officials said.
   ``I would implore the ambulance men and women in London that
they have made their point and now is the time to go back to
work,'' said Tom Crosby, head of the London ambulance fleet.

   Dealers are continuing to sell all-terrain
vehicles for use by children despite an agreement between the
government and manufacturers to curtail such sales, a consumer
group charged Monday.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private organization
affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said 54 percent of
dealers surveyed told volunteers who called on the telephone that
an adult-sized vehicle would be appropriate for use by children
under age 16.
   In addition, 75 percent of the dealers responding said it would
not be difficult for a 10-year-old to learn to ride an adult-sized
ATV, the consumer advocacy organization said.
   ``Too many ATV dealers would rather make a buck than tell a
customer that ATV's are death traps for children under 16,'' said
Pamela Gilbert, consumer program director for the organization.
   Ms. Gilbert said volunteers called 215 dealerships in
California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey,
New Mexico, Vermont and Washington.
   The volunteers represented themselves as potential customers,
saying they were interested in buying an ATV for a child of 10.
   According to the survey, salespeople at Otho Williams Buick
Honda in Forestville, Md., and Sun Cycles Yamaha in Wheaton, Md.,
told the callers that some ATV's would be safe for a child of that
age.
   Dan Donahue, general sales manager for Otho Williams, said he
knew of no such incident and added that it is the dealership's
policy not to make such sales. ``I have personally chased people
away who wanted to buy one for somebody under age,'' he said. ``It
is our policy here not sell to anyone under age.''
   Donahue added, however, ``The one that I know for sure that I
turned away went to another dealer and bought one.''
   Mac Seavey, sales manager for Sun Cycles, said, ``I have
instructed our sales personnel to adhere to these guidelines. We
have had some turnover in sales personnel. I don't know who they
spoke with on the phone, but we stick to it to the letter.''
   In January 1988 five ATV manufacturers _ Honda, Kawasaki,
Suzuki, Yamaha and Polaris _ agreed to ban sales of three-wheel
ATVs in the United States. The ATV makers also agreed to restrict
the sales of certain four-wheelers for use by children over 16 and
adults.
   The agreement resulted from a suit by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
   ``When the consent decree was signed, many people thought the
ATV problem had been solved,'' said Ms. Gilbert. ``Now we know that
ATV dealers are still misleading the public about the vehicles'
dangers.''
   Fifty-four percent of the dealers said they would sell large
four-wheel ATVs for use by a 10-year-old, in violation of the
agreement, the Public Interest Research Group said.
   Manufacturers are responsible for making dealers aware of the
provisions of the agreement, a spokesman for the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said.
   ATVs are motorized machines that can traverse rough, off-road
terrain. They range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters.
   Under the agreement, only ATVs smaller than 90cc are permitted
for sale for children 12 to 16 years old.
   In 1988, about 40 percent of the ATV-related deaths and injuries
reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission involved
children under 16.
   The commission has received 1,346 ATV death reports for 1982
through June 21, 1989. Thirty-six deaths involving the vehicles
were reported this year, with 20 involving the four-wheel machines.

<TEXT>
   President Bush intends to meet with Nicaraguan
opposition candidate Violetta Chamorro during a summit in Costa
Rica but does not plan to have talks with Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, who also will be there, the White House said Monday.
   Bush will fly to San Jose, Costa Rica, on Friday at the
invitation of President Oscar Arias to take part in a meeting
marking 100 years of democracy in that Central American country.
   Leaders of about 18 countries are expected to participate in the
summit. The talks, which conclude before noon Saturday, are to be
held at a resort complex about five miles from San Jose.
   Ortega will attend as president of Nicaragua, while Ms. Chamorro
will be there as part of an observer delegation. She is the
presidential candidate of the National Opposition Union in
elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Following a policy he inherited from Ronald Reagan, Bush is
trying to drive Oretaga from office, arguing that he leads a
Marxist government.
   On Saturday, Bush signed a $9 million aid package intended to
help the opposition defeat the ruling Sandinista government.
   While no meeting with Ortega is planned, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater noted that that the Nicaraguan leader
will be in the same room with Bush during two plenary sessions and
again during dinner.
   Fitzwater said the summit ``may be a very unique opportunity for
us and the other countries of the hemisphere to impress on
Nicaragua the importance of democracy and the folly of their ways.''
   However, Fitzwater said Bush's role will be ``somewhat limited''
because he will not have any remarks or speeches related to the
summit.
   Bush is expected to make departure remarks at nearby Andrews Air
Force Base before dawn Friday as he heads for Costa Rica.
   After the close of the summit, Bush is supposed to speak to
employees at the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica. Fitzwater said the
president probably will meet outside the summit with some of the
leaders.
   Because the theme of the summit is democracy, the leaders of
Cuba, Panama, Haiti and Chile were not invited. Fitzwater said the
United States ``did not dictate or comment on the guest list.''

   Daphne Maxwell Reid, co-star of CBS's
``Snoops,'' said she still has a ``bitter taste'' over what she
felt were racially motivated snubs when she was named Northwestern
University homecoming queen 22 years ago.
   ``I walked up, and the (university) president stuck a crown of
roses on my head and looked at me in total shock,'' she said in an
interview for the Oct. 28 edition of TV Guide.
   ``No one said anything to me. No one congratulated me. It was
like I had the plague,'' she said, adding that she was one of 36
blacks among 6,000 students at the Evanston, Ill., school. ``I was
presented with a cup, but it didn't have my name on it, and it
still doesn't have my name on it, and it's 22 years.''
   Ms. Maxwell Reid, whose co-star is her husband, Tim Reid, said
Northwestern today has ``changed and it's a fine school. But I
still have a bitter taste.''

<HEAD>House Approves Tighter Restrictions on Foreign Weapons Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Monday to tighten restrictions
on weapons sales to countries that support terrorism, approving
legislation that was spawned by the Reagan administration's
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   The bill, expected to be approved later by the Senate, would
strengthen the current ban on arms sales to countries officially
designated as repeatedly supporting international terrorist acts.
That list now includes Iran, Libya, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and
South Yemen. Both government and private sales are affected.
   The measure was approved by a voice vote.
   It also would put tighter controls on the president's ability to
waive the prohibitions, requiring that the ban be lifted only if
national security requires it, and then only after Congress is
notified.
   Current law controlling arms sales abroad is ``sloppy and
confusing,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who sponsored the
bill in an effort to eliminate the loopholes that allowed the U.S.
sale of missiles to Iran in 1986.
   The measure imposes new penalties on violators and requires more
detailed reporting of arms exports, including authority for
transfers of U.S. weapons from the initial purchaser to a third
country.
   It is similar to legislation passed last year by the House, but
which died in the Senate. Berman said the measure has been endorsed
by the White House this time around, and is now more likely to
receive Senate approval.

   Former President Habib Bourguiba, ousted
from power in 1987, has returned home from three weeks in the
hospital, the Ministry of Health said Monday.
   Bourguiba, 86, was in satisfactory condition following prostate
surgery he underwent July 29, the ministry said.
   He entered Charles Nicolle Hospital on Sept. 29. He returned
Sunday to Monastir, the city on Tunisia's southern coast where he
was born, the ministry said.
   After ruling the country since 1957, Bourguiba was ousted from
power Nov. 7, 1987 by his prime minister, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali,
who said the aging president had become senile and physically unfit
to hold office.

<HEAD>South Yemeni Says Talks Under Way to Resume Ties With U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Yemeni Prime Minister Yassine Saeed No'man
said Monday his Marxist country has begun talks with the United
States seeking the restoration of diplomatic relations ruptured two
decades ago.
   At the end of a three-day official visit to Kuwait, No'man told
reporters that the talks with Washington were launched in New York
10 days ago on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly debates.
South Yemen's U.N. representative, Abdullah al-Ashkal, and U.S.
diplomats were involved in the negotiations.
   The prime minister said more meetings will be held in two weeks
but did not specify a venue or identify the officials involved.
   He said his country set no conditions for the resumption of
ties, adding that ``the reasons which led to the rupture should no
longer figure.'' He did not elaborate.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
confirmed a meeting recently took place between U.N. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering and South Yemen's U.N. ambassador. But, she said,
``these discussions were not negotiations and we did not raise the
issue of resuming diplomatic relations.''
   ``We expressed concern about terrorism and about South Yemen's
relations with its neighbors who are friends of the U.S.,'' she
said. ``We expect further discussions with South Yemen but no
further meetings have been scheduled.''
   Aden ruptured ties with Washington in 1969, two years after
indepndence from Britain and the subsequent rise to power of a
Marxist government.
   South and North Yemen, and Djibouti share control of the
strategic Bab al-Mandeb entrance to the Red Sea. South Yemen became
a major facility for Soviet naval units in the Indian Ocean in the
past two decades.

   Leaders of upper crust Palm Beach say
The Limited clothing stores would attract the wrong element and
should remain limited to shopping malls and other less ritzy venues.
   But a landlord who wants to rent to the chain on exclusive Worth
Avenue _ an East Coast equivalent of Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive _
is crying snobbery and will seek to overturn the ban in Palm Beach
Circuit Court beginning this week.
   The Town Council's rejection was ``arbitrary and capricious,''
according to J. Michael Burman, attorney for landlord Burton
Handelsman.
   Several residents earned applause for speaking against The
Limited at a council meeting in March 1988.
   ``I've been in their other shops, and it's nothing you can't buy
in a mall,'' resident Elise Mackintosh complained at a council
meeting in March 1988. ``It's not very dignified.''
   Elizabeth Summers complained that the shops ``sell very
inexpensive clothes; they are always on sale.''
   She said when another chain store moved to Worth Avenue,
merchants ``were all extremely upset with the type of merchandise
that they were carrying, plus the type of people they would
attract.''
   Mackintosh and other residents were not swayed by the assurances
of a spokesman for The Limited who told them ``Jacqueline Onassis,
Meryl Streep and Mrs. William F. Buckley, to name a few, have
shopped in our Madison Avenue store'' in New York City.
   According to town ordinances drafted in 1980, large retail
stores must prove the majority of their customers do not come from
``off-island locations,'' said John DeVault, a Jacksonville lawyer
representing the town.
   Handelsman's attorney countered that the landlord is not subject
to the standard because the site was in use as a restaurant before
the ordinance was enacted and is ``grandfathered in.'' Handelsman
bought the site for $3.2 million in July 1983.
   The landlord's attorney also said the town fails to define
methods on how to prove the customer base for a proposed store.

<HEAD>Iran Links Hostage Release to Missing Iranians, Frozen Assets</HEAD>

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Monday
offered help in getting Western hostages freed in Lebanon if the
United States releases billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets
or helps settle the cases of three kidnapped Iranians.
   Rafsanjani said hostage-taking is an ``inhuman action'' hat can
produce no positive political results. Eighteen Westerners,
including eight Americans, are believed to be held by pro-Iranian
groups in Lebanon.
   While Rafsanjani said his government was maintaining indirect
contacts with Washington, his offer and demands were not new.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Rafsanjani's
comments did not change the U.S. position.
   ``We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages and we do
not make deals for hostages,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani spoke at a three-hour news conference attended by
about 50 foreign media representatives issued visas specifically
for the event. Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilinged
hall of the presidential office in downtown Tehran, Rafsanjani
spoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with a
string of worry beads.
   Responding to a question from a U.S. reporter, Rafsanjani said
he had proposed ``two methods'' that the United States could use to
facilitate release of the hostages:
   ``The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release our
assets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner or
later you will be forced to do it. So do it now.
   ``Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at least
you can get your agents, your lackeys in Lebanon to release our
hostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give us
back their bodies or show us their graves.''
   The assets, estimated at at between $9 billion and $12 billion,
have been frozen since the U.S. Embassy was seized by students in
Tehran in November 1979, nine months after the Islamic revolution
seized power, overthrowing the pro-Western monarchy.
   Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen kidnapped the three
Iranians in north Lebanon in July 1982. The missing are Ahmad
Motevaselian, commander of the contingent of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon; Iranian Charge
d'Affaires Hussein Musavi; and Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent for
the Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Their Lebanese Shiite driver, Rastegar Moqadam, who also held an
Iranian passport, was grabbed with them at at a Lebanese Forces
checkpoint 25 miles north of Beirut. All four are believed dead.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 that
after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the
missing men and blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for their
disappearance and apparent murder.
   Geagea's disclosure was the first formal comment by the Lebanese
Forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing
Iranians.
   Rafsanjani earlier had argued that the United States was keeping
the issue of the American hostages in Lebanon alive ``mainly as a
bridge in order to approach us and establish relations with the
Islamic Republic of Iran, and this is a mistake.''
   At one point during the news conference, Rafsanjani said: ``The
thing is that your governments are not as much interested as you
foreign journalists are in the question of hostages. You'd better
make your governments interested in the matter.''
   In addition to the Americans, the hostages are four Britons, two
West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. Held longest
is American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Rafsanjani made contradictory
statements on the hostage issue.
   Though at one stage he said Iran could assist in the release of
the hostages, he later declared that ``we do not want to become
involved in this issue'' and denied that Iran could exert any
influence on the captors.
   He admitted Iran has close relations with Hezbollah, or Party of
God, widely believed to be behind the hostage taking. But he
maintained that the kidnappers were outside Hezbollah.
   Asked about prospects of improving relations with Washington, he
said there had been no direct contacts between the two governments
since a secret visit by former U.S. National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane in 1986.
   Three American hostages were released between November 1985 and
September 1986. In return, Iran secretly received weapons and spare
parts from the United States.
   ``But there have been indirect contacts,'' Rafsanjani said. ``We
have received messages through two neighboring countries from the
United States.'' He did not identify the countries.
   ``In these messages they told us they have no ill-will toward us
and want to solve the problem with us,'' he said. ``But we still
have no confidence in what they say. We ask for signs and
indications of goodwill on their part.''
   Rafsanjani said these views had been relayed to the United
States through the unspecified neighboring countries.
   He ruled out any participation by U.S. corporations in Iran's
post-war reconstruction, saying: ``I don't think American companies
can play any role in Iran.''

<HEAD>Solidarity May Get Mayor's Job in Poland's Second-Largest City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity could gain control of city hall
in Lodz, Poland's second-largest city, following a meeting Monday
in which local officials agreed to leave the choice up to Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   A meeting by representatives of Solidarity, the Communist Party
and other political groups decided after a lengthy discussion that
``the mayoral crisis ... is ripe for a decision by the prime
minister,'' the state PAP news agency said.
   Organizer Andrzej Grabski said some names were discussed at the
meeting that he could not reveal. Based on the discussion, he said
he was optimistic the matter would be settled soon.
   The appointment would end a nearly five-month impasse over the
selection of mayor of Lodz. It could also mark Solidarity's first
victory in taking control of provincial and municipal governments
from the Communist Party.
   Solidarity already has assumed leadership of the national
government after the election of Solidarity adviser Mazowiecki as
prime minister Aug. 24, and fully democratic elections for local
governing councils are being planned for sometime next year.
   With communist power on the wane in the central government and
in government-owned enterprises, provincial and municipal
governments remain the last bastion of communist power.
   The post of mayor for the city of 850,000 people has been vacant
since May 29, when the previous communist city president was ousted
in a no-confidence vote following complaints of poor administration.
   An Oct. 11 attempt to elect a mayor failed when the
communist-dominated city council refused to approve either of the
two rival Solidarity-linked candidates approved by Mazowiecki.
   Mazowiecki earlier had declined to nominate either of two
candidates proposed for the post by the Communist Party.
   Grabski said he could not guarantee the council would not reject
Mazowiecki's nominee again, but he said a consensus emerged during
Monday's discussion to give Mazowiecki ``full trust'' in his
decision.
   In the past, all provincial and municipal governments were under
the central government and the Communist Party.
   Under reforms being prepared by Solidarity and the Mazowiecki
government, local governments would be elected in fully democratic
voting by their communities and they in turn would choose mayors
and other local officers independent of Warsaw.

<TEXT>
   California lawmakers today asked Congress for
an initial $3.8 billion package of federal aid for the
earthquake-ravaged San Francisco Bay area, while the Bush
administration proposed up to $2.5 billion in relief.
   The House Appropriations Committee arranged a late-afternoon
meeting on a bipartisan package put together by California's
47-member congressional delegation, with action by the full House
scheduled Tuesday.
   White House aides and committee leaders worked in advance of the
session to try to reach a compromise on the aid figure.
   ``Our current estimate is that the total federal contribution
will probably have to be a little over $2.4 billion,'' White House
Budget Director Richard Darman said upon emerging from a meeting
with Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the appropriations
committee.
   ``That's obviously subject to refinement,'' Darman said, adding
the White House wants to avoid the ``kind of situation where you
have a bidding war and then a veto threat.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the House Budget Committee
chairman, said the Californians' package included $1.1 billion of
direct aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a
wide variety of relief programs and $1 billion for rebuilding
highways and bridges.
   Another $1.2 billion in disaster loans would be provided through
the Small Business Administration for rebuilding damaged homes and
businesses. The bill also includes $100 million in loan guarantees
for public and private companies in low-income areas and $400
million in discretionary spending. President Bush would determine
how the discretionary money is spent.
   In an indication that Congress and the administration may not be
far apart, Darmon said his figure did not include ``raising the
ceiling on the ability of the Small Business Administration to
issue loans.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said up to $1 billion
could be taken from existing programs, including $250 million of
unspent money authorized for aiding victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   He said the adminstration was abandoning an effort to assemble
its own relief package and would work with Congress in fashioning
one because of the shortness of time involved.
   ``It sounds to me they are trying to set a parameter to cut a
deal,'' Panetta said of the White House proposal. ``Ultimately I
think we will resolve a final number between the administration and
Congress.''
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, described the administration's $2.5 billion figure as
an early number reached before the damage estimates escalated over
the weekend.
   ``It's my feeling the $2.5 billion, in the mind's eye of the
administration, has already been raised,'' Lewis said.
   Panetta, whose district south of San Francisco suffered severe
damage in last Tuesday's earthquake, said the aid package still
could become a vehicle for raising gasoline taxes or other levies.
But he acknowledged the prospects for that are uncertain.
   ``The bottom line is that we are going to need to develop more
resources,'' he said. ``If not, you're looking at this basically
feeding into the deficit. I don't like that approach, but our first
priority is to help the victims of this kind of disaster.''
   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., told the Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee on transportation and natural resources. ``FEMA is
stretched very thin.''
   Bush last Friday declined on several occasions to say whether he
would consider breaking his ``no new taxes'' pledge to help pay for
disaster relief, saying only that the government would do what it
had to do.
   However, Fitzwater said today that, ``We do not intend to raise
taxes'' to deal with the earthquake aftermath.
   ``President Bush viewed the human agony and the physical
destruction associated with this disaster'' when he toured the area
on Friday, the spokesman said.
   ``He is committed to providing all the federal help that is
possible'' short of proposing a tax increase, Fitzwater said.
   U.S. officials said the administration, as in the congressional
plan, would propose tapping the $12 billion federal Highway Trust
Fund to help California rebuild highways and bridges damaged in
last Tuesday's quake.
   The federal gasoline tax is the major source of revenue for the
trust fund.
   Barbara Clay, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said OMB officials had worked through the weekend and were
still at work today on coming up with a preliminary cost estimate
for the damage.
   However, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., warned reporters on
Sunday in San Francisco, ``Unfortunately, all the cost cannot be
covered'' by government aid.
   ``There will be some loss,'' said Cranston, who predicted the
federal government would provide $3.5 billion in aid but estimated
property loss and damage to roads and highways at more than $7
billion.
   In addition to the amount of aid to be determined, Congress must
also decide how to raise the funds.
   Bush sidestepped questions Friday about whether he would support
a tax increase to finance the package. Some lawmakers have proposed
an exemption in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law to accommodate
the aid needed.

<HEAD>Thatcher Battles in Classic Style, But The Rest Had Had Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher battled the rest of 49-nation Commonwealth, the former
British Empire, over South Africa at this week's summit meeting.
But this time, the others had had enough.
   Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accused Mrs. Thatcher of
ignoring a cherished British tradition, ``fair play,'' when she
issued a dissenting statement against plans by the 49-nation
Commonwealth to pressure South Africa on reform.
   ``The price of Commonwealth membership is loyalty,'' Mulroney
told her as the presidents and prime ministers of ex-colonies
gathered round the conference table in closed session Monday, the
second-last day of the weeklong summit.
   Australia's Bob Hawke said: ``This is not the way business
should be done.''
   Mrs. Thatcher responded that she was ``astounded and utterly
appalled'' at the attacks and owed the other leaders ``no
explanation whatsoever.'
   The anger provoked by what was a matter of procedure, not
substance, reflected the deep frustration in the largely Third
World organization over what its sees as Mrs. Thatcher's constant
obstruction of the fight against apartheid.
   South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 under threat of being
thrown out because of its apartheid policy, which denies the black
majority the vote. Britain, a major South African trading partner,
argues sanctions hurt the black majority and increase white
resistance to change.
   South Africa's deeply hostile black southern African neighbors,
mostly Commonwealth members, also continue trading because they
depend economically on South Africa.
   Mrs. Thatcher has refused to impose most of a list of 11
non-binding Commonwealth embargoes against South Africa, including
bans on air links, new investment, and imports of agricultural
products, iron, steel, coal and urnanium. It was drawn up in 1986
after Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the other white founding
members joined the effort.
   The new South Africa declaration was drafted by 10 foreign
ministers after 17 hours of tough negotiations. British Foreign
Secretary John Major argued that moves toward reform by South
Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, made sanctions especially
inappropriate now.
   Everyone compromised a bit _ the British agreed that current
embargoes should not be lifted and African nations held off demands
for new trade sanctions. The final document called for tighter
financial pressure, but that other sanctions would be considered
only if the white-led government fails to take measures dismantling
apartheid in the next six months.
   The declaration incorporated an Australian proposal that the
Commonwealth call on international banks to restrict South African
trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make
it more difficult for South Africa to get credits.
   They all signed on Sunday, with Mrs. Thatcher personally
proposing its adoption. She didn't mention that within an hour
she'd be releasing a five-page statement setting out her objections
to sanctions and crediting the South African government with
``important and positive changes.''
   It was this tactic that angered Hawke and Mulroney, the main
authors of the report.
   ``Where would we be if 49 countries did this?'' Mulroney said,
speaking to reporters. ``You sign a deal at 5 o'clock and repudiate
it at six ... (saying) by the way, what I signed really doesn't
reflect all my views.''
   ``I think it's despicable,'' said Zimbabwe President Robert
Mugabe, whose country, however, is among those that has continued
trading with neighboring South Africa. ``What turns out to be the
majority view should bind us all _ that's how democratic systems
work.''
   On the environment, the Commonwealth issued a declaration
Saturday calling for assurances that poor countries are not blamed
for problems beyond their control nor shortchanged in the fight
against global pollution.
   Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said industrialized
countries in the West cause most pollution while poor countries are
asked to stop cutting down trees and take other measures to protect
the environment.
   ``The deserts of the world can be made to bloom if the rich
countries are prepared to spend money to draw up underground water
and plant trees instead of just building golf courses'' in
California deserts, he said, without elaborating.
   Referring to fears that pollution-caused global warming could
melt polar ice and raise sea levels, Maldives President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom said his Indian Ocean island nation was willing to
host the Commonwealth summit in the year 2050 but might have to do
it underwater.

<HEAD>Justice Department Denies Unnecessary Delays in CIA Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Monday called
``totally off-base'' the Iran-Contra prosecutor's contention that
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is using procedural delays to
thwart the trial of a former CIA agent.
   The Justice Department's ``effort, as it has been all along is
to protect the national security of the United States while
allowing the trial to go forward. That's our bottom-line objective
and we are trying to bring that about,'' said spokesman David
Runkel.
   ``I think the attorney general feels that those comments that
were made in the court filing last week to be totally off-base,''
Runkel said of the charge made in court pleadings by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   ``We are having discussions with a number of people on how best
to resolve the case'' of former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez, Runkel
said.
   The spokesman refused to say whether the Justice Department was
pressing the CIA and other intelligence agencies to release
material the CIA wants kept secret.
   Walsh, asking a federal appeals court to lift a stay in
Fernandez' trial, accused Thornburgh of using ``unjustifiable
delaying tactics'' designed ``to tie this case in a knot of endless
litigation.''
   Thornburgh was much less emphatic when asked about Walsh's
charge, saying: ``the court record speaks for itself.''
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh, refused to comment.
   In his filing last week, Walsh asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals to rescind its order granting the Justice Department at
least another month's delay to give Thornburgh's attorneys more
time to ponder secrecy issues raised by the Fernandez case.
   At issue is a trial judge's order that the defense could
disclose the locations of three CIA stations in Central America
when Fernandez was station chief in Costa Rica.
   The Justice Department wants to block references to the
locations during the trial even though they have been publicized.
Walsh said the CIA was merely trying to preserve a ``diplomatic
fiction'' by refusing to allow references to the stations to be
made in court.
   The appellate court ruled last month that the Justice Department
couldn't appeal the trial judge's order, saying Thornburgh could
exercise the politically distasteful option of filing an affidavit
blocking release of the secrets.
   Such an affidavit would likely result in dismissal of the
charges against Fernandez, who is accused of lying to the CIA and
to a presidential commission about his role in helping set up an
arms-supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   In seeking a 30-day extension in the deadline on requesting an
appeal of the 4th Circuit's ruling, the department said the
solicitor general needed more time to decide whether to seek a
rehearing of the case.

   Cartographer Idrova DeSoto was one of
the first to investigate the land's ins and outs, and the Golden
Age came when B. Wright Bach finished his ``Unfinished Symphony.''
   Those facts, along with everything everyone ever wanted to know
about the Islands of Pun and the Free Associations _ beginning with
their discovery by Hugo Yurway and Al Gomine _ is summed up in a
134-page manuscript titled ``Isthmus Be the Place.''
   The manuscript goes with a Pun Map that was put together five
years ago by Richard Amor of the forensics services division at
Central State Hospital and Will Humphrey, a music director at
Southside Elementary School in Milledgeville.
   At first Amor and Humphrey concentrated on recognizable place
names such as Mary Tyler Moor and Hugh Downs. Then they added old
sayings and fairy tale characters.
   Finally the map turned into something they could hawk. The
$7.50-per-copy map was copyrighted in 1984.
   Their as-yet unpublished ``Isthmus'' provides practical
information: fly the Receding Airline to get to Pun, don't forget

and their famous square roots.

   Advocates for people displaced
by the civil war accused the government Monday of holding up the
return of 1,300 refugees suffering illness and exposure because of
the delay.
   The National Resettlement Coordinator and members of a U.S.
churchworkers' delegation called on the rightist administration of
President Alfredo Cristiani to remove all obstacles to the
refugees' return.
   The government says it has nothing against the refugees' return
but that they must be documented in Honduras by Salvadoran
officials before coming back. The Resettlement Coordinator accused
the government ``of prolonging the documentation process'' to delay
the refugees' return.
   About 13,000 Salvadorans live in three refugee camps across the
northern border in Honduras. Most fled to the camps in the early
1980s because of heavy fighting between leftist rebels and
government forces in the northern sector of El Salvador.
   More than 7,000 refugees have returned since 1987 to rebuild
their lives in the north, still a combat zone in the 10-year-old
civil war. The U.S.-backed government considers the returned
refugees sympathizers and collaborators of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, the rebel army.
   About 1,300 refugees from the Mesa Grande camp had planned to
return Oct. 17. The return was to have been coordinated by the U.N.
High Commission for Refugees.
   Col. Carlos Figueroa said Saturday the documentation has begun
in Mesa Grande and that as soon as it is finished, the refugees
will be allowed to return.
   The U.N. commission said it cannot provide transportation and
other logistics for return without government approval.
   The Resettlement Coordinator's allegation of government delays
was seconded by a delegation of 30 American churchpeople who
traveled to Honduras and El Salvador this month to accompany the
returnees.
   The Rev. Marilyn Chilcote, a Presbyterian pastor from Oakland,
Calif., said three people have died in Mesa Grande from exposure
since the refugees dismantled their shacks last week in
anticipation of departure. She also said an epidemic of Dengue
fever has afflicted many refugees.
   About 300 refugees accompanied by Salvadoran and U.S.
churchworkers left Mesa Grande by foot last week for the border.
They reached San Marcos Ocotepeque, where they remain in precarious
conditions in a church awaiting documentation, the refugee
advocates said.

   The grit of beefy Buck Helm was extolled by
a balladeer inspired by the longshoreman's miraculous rescue from
the rubble of an earthquake-flattened freeway.
   Bandleader Jimmy Price wrote ``The Ballad of Buck Helm'' for
crooning Monday at the New Orleans Room of the Fairmount Hotel, and
he also planned to record the tune.
   ``The idea came to me like a flash,'' said Price, 59, a native
San Franciscan. ``I popped out of bed at 6 a.m. (Sunday) and
frantically pulled out my music paper. It was like I was inspired
from on high.
   ``His story really moved me,'' Price said. ``Everybody's heads
were down after the earthquake, and then we had Buck Helm happen to
us.''
   Helm, 57, was plucked Saturday from the collapsed section of
Interstate 880 after 90 hours behind the wheel of his partially
crushed Chevrolet Sprint.
   The lyrics:
   ``Hey, Buck, we're pulling for you,
   ``Your heart is pulling us through,
   ``Our hopes were down, but you
   ``Opened our eyes to tomorrow.
   
   ``Four days down in the tomb,
   ``Looking in the face of doom,
   ``Then that small beam of light,
   ``Said everything would be all right, all right.
   
   ``Bobby said, `Don't worry, be happy,'
   ``But trouble came to shake us around.
   ``Then through that darkness before the light,
   ``You showed us that things would be all right, all right.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Farmers Won't Have Disaster Checks Cut For Some Second
Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who rotated their traditional spring
crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by drought or
freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments for their
losses, the Agriculture Department announced Monday.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called the decision by the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service good news for
some farmers, but said it does not go far enough in reversing USDA
regulations that would cut disaster assistance to many other
farmers who had also planted a second crop after the drought.
   A Senate aide said the USDA's decision Monday apparently applies
to only winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second
crop, such as milo, on non-wheat acres in the spring. Those farmers
who planted their second crop on the wheat acres instead, to take
advantage of fertilizer already on the land, will not see their
disaster checks cut, the aide said.
   Monday's decision does not cover cotton farmers who also planted
a second crop, or farmers who planted non-traditional second crops
on their wheat acreage, officials said.
   ``I am still unhappy that people who did not plant a second
crop, who waited for the government to help, are in some cases
better off than the people who planted a second crop,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Farm state lawmakers contend USDA's formula for calculating
disaster payments under an $895 million relief program for farmers
hurt by this year's severe weather was unfair to producers who
planted a second crop.
   Legislators and USDA have been wrangling over the regulations on
``ghost acres'' for two months and one Senate aide said Monday's
decision came because ``we hand to force their hand on this.''
   According to Bentsen, some farmers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma
and elsewhere on the Great Plains planted milo or cotton on their
failed wheat acres this year.
   ``The acres that would have been planted to the spring crop were
often left fallow, with the intention of planting this fall's wheat
crop there,'' said Bentsen, D-Texas. ``Such a rotation allows the
spring crop to use the fertilizer and water put down for the failed
wheat crop, and it allows for the control of troublesome weeds,
such as johnsongrass, on the fallowed land.''
   But Bentsen said those farmers were told by ASCS that their
disaster checks would be reduced if they instead planted their
spring cotton or milo crops on the winter wheat land.
   ``Had they planted the spring crop normally, without rotating it
to the failed wheat acres, there would be no reduction in the
disaster checks,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen said USDA's initial plans were unfair and went against
Congress' intentions when it passed the disaster relief package.
   ``It is obviously unfair to penalize farmers when they are
following normal farming practices by simply rotating their crops
on the farm,'' Bentsen said.

<HEAD>Court Convicts Two Separatists in Spain's Worst Terrorist Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Monday convicted two Basque
separatists for murder in a 1987 car bombing at a Barcelona
supermarket that killed 21 people and seriously injured 44 in
Spain's bloodiest terrorist attack.
   The court sentenced the man and woman, both members of the
Basque separatist organization ETA, to a total of 1,588 years in
prison for murder and wrongful injury.
   ETA terrorists have been waging a campaign for independence for
three predominantly Basque provinces in northern Spain since 1968
and they have been blamed for thousands of deaths in assassinations
and bombings. The June 19, 1987, bombing in the garage of the
Hipercor supermarket in Barcelona was their deadliest attack.
   ETA stands for Basque Homeland and Libery in the Basque language.
   Four ETA members were indicted in the Barcelona bombing but only
the two were tried. A third suspect has not been captured and the
fourth is being held in France awaiting a ruling on a Spanish
request for extradition.
   During the trial, defendants Dominigo Troitino and Josefa
Mercedes Ernaga admitted their role in the bombing but blamed
officials for the casualties. They said authorities failed to clear
the area after receiving an ETA telephone call advising them the
bomb would go off.
   Although each defendant was sentenced to 794 years in prison,
the maximum punishment allowed under the Spanish constitution is 30
years.

<TEXT>
   Lena Spencer, whose Caffe Lena was
a training ground for a generation of folksingers that include Bob
Dylan, Arlo Guthrie and Maria Muldaur, died Monday. She was 66.
   Ms. Spencer died at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady of injuries
she suffered when she fell down a flight of stairs Sept. 10 at her
coffeehouse in Saratoga Springs, hospital spokeswoman Christine
DeCarlo said.
   Ms. Spencer and her then-husband, Bill Spencer, opened the
coffeehouse in May 1960, providing a needed stage early in the
careers of such folksingers as Dylan, Guthrie, Muldaur, Don McLean,
Pete Seeger, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, David Bromberg, Steve Goodman
and John Phillips.
   ``The Caffe is my whole existence, the be-all and end-all of my
life,'' Ms. Spencer said in a January 1989 interview.
   She and her husband divorced in the mid 1960s.
   When the popularity of folk music declined in the late 1970s,
Caffe Lena suffered and Ms. Spencer suffered as well. She earned
$32 for a bit role in the movie ``Ironweed,'' which was filmed in
the Albany area, and spent the last several years of her life
living in a back room of her coffeehouse.
   Ms. Spencer is survived by two brothers. Funeral arrangements
were incomplete Monday, but burial was planned at St. Mary's
Cemetery in Milford.

   Boarding one of the first
ferryboats pressed into emergency service Monday to carry commuters
across San Francisco Bay, I expected a romantic ride through the
fog. Reality brought nausea.
   The worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of
thousands of residents in Alameda and Contra Costa counties east of
San Francisco began the trek to work.
   This 127-foot ocean vessel, one of 14 being run on routes unused
by ferries for decades, met blustery winds, giant swells that
crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching
from side to side. The song of the journey should be, ``I Left My
Stomach on San Francisco Bay.''
   The 55-minute voyage, made necessary because of the collapse of
a 50-foot section of the vital San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
during last Tuesday's quake, was twice what was expected.
   The triple-deck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes
late because of weather worries and a low passenger count. The
captain announced some boats might be turned back. A big groan.
   I arrived dockside before dawn, naively thinking I could relive
idyllic bay crossings created by writers like Jack London and in
such classic movies as Humphrey Bogart's ``Dark Passage.''
   I wasn't alone.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it; it can only get better, this can't get much worse,''
said an ashen-faced John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda, who came onto
the deck to alleviate sea sickness.
   I moved up to the bow, where a giant swell drenched me. Since I
was downwind, I figured it would be best to remain there in case I
lost my breakfast.
   The ferry, with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338, was
supposed to dock at the Union Ferry Building in San Francisco. But
waves craching there forced the boats to divert to Fisherman's
Wharf.
   Altogether my commute _ from hearth to work station _ took 3{
hours. I used to do it in 45 minutes. At the wharf, I tried to
catch a cable car into downtown, only to find it shut down. I
walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city
bus to work.
   Roughing it across the bay didn't dampen everybody's spirits.
   ``Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,''
said Maggie Faulkner, 46, of Oakland.
   Karen Meyer, 42, of Oakland, used to work on Long Island, N.Y.,
ferries, and was unflappable.
   ``Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion,'' she
said. ``That includes all the bosses.''
   Elena Pierini, 44, of Oakland, recalled taking ferries to
Berkeley as a child. She relived those memories Monday morning.
   ``This makes up for all the bad things that came out of the
earthquake,'' said the San Francisco General Hospital research
nurse.
   The weather was trying for Dick Simpson, vice president of
marketing for Crowley Maritime, which operated the ferries. He rode
the Catalina Empress, which normally operates between Long Beach
and Catalina Island in Southern California.
   ``Mother nature is testing our mental state; normally this bay
is as smooth as glass at this time,'' said Simpson. About 3,000
people used the ferries Monday morning, Crowley said.
   The bay's ferryboat industry to the East bay, which began in
1863, grew to include hundreds of boats at its height in the early
1930s. It was discontinued shortly after the Bay bridge opened in
1937.

<HEAD>Official Worries that Salt Dome May Be Leaking Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAXTERVILLE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underground cavity in a salt dome
where two nuclear weapons were tested in the 1960s may be leaking
radioactive materials, state officials say.
   At least one federal official says there is no problem.
   ``I think a study should be done to answer questions we still
have about whether there are cracks in the dome and whether it's
leaking,'' said James Pinson, who helped the Department of Energy
conduct what he calls an inconclusive 1979-1980 study at the site.
   Pinson, a nuclear chemist at the University of Southern
Mississippi at Hattiesburg, said the study of the Tatum Salt Dome
left many unanswered questions about activities at the test site.
   Another underground salt formation, near Carlsbad, N.M., is the
site of the federal government's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a
complex of chambers intended for permanent storage of military
radioactive waste. The WIPP was supposed to open last October, but
questions about the long-term safety of the salt bed and
transportation of waste to the site have delayed the opening.
   Tests near the Tatum dome show tritium levels are increasing in
overflow ponds when they should be decreasing, he said.
   Some scientists fear the formation of solid salt may be cracked,
allowing potentially hazardous radioactive isotopes such as tritium
to escape from the cavity formed by the explosions a half-mile
beneath Lamar County in 1964 and 1966.
   Another theory is that the salt is squeezing together, forcing
radioactive brine from within the dome up toward the surface,
Pinson said.
   Test samples taken by the state Board of Health have found
relatively high levels of tritium at the surface above the salt
dome during the dry season. These levels diminish as the wet season
encroaches and water runs off into swollen creeks and overflow
ponds near ground zero.
   Since the levels of tritium appear to be restored each year,
some experts theorize a leak in the dome continually replenishes
the isotope in soil near the surface.
   Federal guidelines for safe drinking water limit tritium to
20,000 picocuries per liter. A picocurie is a measure of the rate
at which atoms disintegrate radioactively.
   Tritium has been found at levels as high as 1 million picocuries
per liter in mud around ground zero, the point directly above the
blast chamber, records show.
   ``Obviously there's a pretty good source of tritium down there
at the site,'' said Ron Forsyth, manager of the state Energy Plan
Development. ``And we've been asking ourselves for a decade ...
where it's coming from. Whether it's leaking? Of course that's
something we wonder.''
   The dome is free of leaks, said Stuart Black, nuclear radiation
advisor to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ``That's a
pretty good salt dome,'' he said.
   Stuart said EPA tests have not found hazardous levels of tritium.
   Of the seasonal cycle of tritium, he said: ``We don't consider
that to be a problem.''
   The pattern of tritium found in shallow test holes several yards
from ground zero is also difficult to explain, said Bob Bell, a
health physicist for the state Department of Health's Radiological
Health Division.
   Bell said tests taken the farthest from ground zero should
reflect the lowest levels of tritium.
   But he found tritium levels decrease in tests of shallow wells
along the periphery of the dome site, then increase in wells
farther away.
   ``We would not expect this activity to show up,'' Bell said,
``and the Department of Energy is in fact trying to evaluate why we
are seeing these levels so far from ground zero.''
   Two non-nuclear natural gas explosions detonated inside the dome
on Feb. 2, 1969, and April 19, 1970, may have released ``some
radioactivity formerly trapped in recrystallized salt on the walls
and floors of the nuclear cavity,'' a 1978 DOE report says.

   J. Lee Bonoff, a key figure in an
alleged defense fraud scheme who was due to go on trial this month,
has died at the age of 62.
   Bonoff, who died Saturday at a sister's house in Madison, Conn.,
was president of Pawtucket-based Carol Cable Co. from 1981 until he
retired in 1985.
   He was indicted in February on charges linked to an alleged
fraud and kickback scheme to sell defective cable to the military.
Two other Carol Cable employees pleaded guilty to charges in the
scheme, and the company paid $1.5 million to settle a civil suit
filed by the federal government.
   The cause of death was not immediately available, but Carl
Jordan, assistant police chief in Madison, said ``there were no
signs of violence.''
   Carl Lunkenheimer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia,
where the charges against Bonoff were filed, said he would move to
dismiss the case as soon as he obtained a death certificate.
   Bonoff had been scheduled to go on trial Oct. 30.
   Bonoff is survived by his wife, Helene, a daughter and a son.
   Services were held Monday.

<HEAD>Miners Threaten Resumption of Strikes in Two Coal Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners are threatening to resume strikes in two
coal basins where walkouts this summer brought much of the Soviet
Union's coal industry to a standstill, the news media reported
Monday.
   Tass, the official news agency, reported that in the western
Siberian town of Mezhdurechensk in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin about
20,000 miners and transport workers participated in a two-hour
warning strike Monday morning.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said in the Arctic Circle town
of Vorkuta workers stopped loading coal at one mine and workers at
12 other mines are planning walkouts beginning Wednesday.
   Reports said the miners claim the government has failed to
fulfill promises it made in order to end the summer's strikes that
involved hundreds of thousands of miners in the Ukraine, Siberia,
the far north and central Asia.
   The Mezhdurechensk strike and planned stoppages in Vorkuta
violate a new strike law passed this month by the Soviet
parliament. The law requires unions to submit disputes to
arbitration before calling a strike and prohibits walkouts in such
vital industries as transport, energy and defense.
   Local leaders in Mezhdurechensk, 1,550 miles east of Moscow,
accused the strikers of showing disrespect for the new law, Tass
said.
   But it reported a strike committee member, Y. Shikharev, told
Tass the strike was only a warning measure and would not harm the
mine's output.
   Tass quoted Shikharev as saying, ``July's strike was only
temporarily stopped. We only renewed it because our demands are not
being fulfilled.''
   Among the concessions won during the summer strikes were
government promises to improve supplies of consumer goods, provide
better working conditions and grant the mines more financial
independence.
   Izvestia said workers in Vorkuta complained that officials were
finding loopholes to avoid delivering some of the promised benefits.
   It said the workers sent telegrams to the Kremlin and the main
Soviet mining areas advising them of the planned strike. The
newspaper also said several legislators were going to the mining
areas to inform the miners that the government was doing its best
to fulfill its promises.
   During the summer strikes, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
in a televised interview that he sympathized with the miners but
the strikes could cause an economic disaster.

   Women nationwide were urged Monday to lobby
Congress to salvage Medicare coverage of breast cancer tests from
the catastrophic health insurance program the House recently voted
to repeal.
   ``If this were a man's issue, it wouldn't be a problem,''
Deborah Dingell, chairwoman of the National Women's Health Resource
Center, said following a ceremony honoring people who have raised
awareness about breast cancer, which strikes one in 10 American
women.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, was cited for her efforts in
Congress, such as including mammography tests in the Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988.
   Ms. Oakar, noting that the House recently voted to repeal the
act, urged the 275 doctors, community leaders and others on hand to
lobby Congress to accept a Senate provision retaining coverage for
breast cancer tests. She called on women across the country to join
the lobbying effort.
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to work out differences
on the program. The mammography program would initially cost $60
million but would ultimately save millions more through early
detection that would save hospitalization costs, Ms. Oakar said.
   If Congress allows mammograms to remain covered by the insurance
program, then Medicare, as of Jan. 1, would pay for the tests every
two years for women aged 65 and over. Women over age 35 who are
eligible for Medicare because of disability would also be covered
for exams, either yearly or every two years depending on their risk.
   According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer will be
diagnosed in 142,000 women this year and will cause 43,000 deaths.
   Susan Ford Bales, spokeswoman for National Breast Cancer
Awareness Month, said 37 percent of American women over age 40 have
never had a mammogram, even though medical experts say breast
cancer deaths could be reduced by one-third if all women over 40
had regular mammograms.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called
Monday for a new military relationship with the Soviet Union to
sharply reduce the ``first strike'' nuclear weapons that could be
devastating in a surprise attack.
   Baker, in his first major arms-control speech, also urged a
reluctant Congress to approve White House requests for funds to
produce mobile Midgetman missiles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets
could exploit differences between Capitol Hill and the Bush
administration.
   ``United we stand; divided we fall,'' Baker said in a speech to
the private Commonwealth Club of San Francisco. Copies were
distributed in Washington by the State Department.
   Baker's emphasis on reducing U.S. and Soviet first-strike
weapons, such as Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballisic missiles,
signals the strategy the United States will pursue in trying to
conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union in Geneva.
   There, U.S. and Soviet negotiators began work in the Reagan
administration to cut arsenals of strategic weapons _
ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and submarines _ by 30 percent to
50 percent. Critics, such as former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger, have urged the United States to put greater stress on
slashing first-strike weapons instead of concentrating on
across-the-board numerical reductions.
   Baker made no reference to a 30 percent to 50 percent cutback in
his speech. This did not suggest the Bush administration would
abandon that goal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START),
but his emphasis on curbing first-strike weapons indicated a more
selective approach in negotiating reductions.
   Like the SS-18, designed to destroy U.S. intercontinental
ballistic missiles in their silos, first-strike nuclear weapons
have the potential of wreaking havoc on the other side's nuclear
forces.
   President Reagan responded to the perceived threat by launching
a program, known popularly as ``Star Wars,'' designed to destroy
Soviet ballistic missiles in space before they could approach their
targets.
   Baker, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentrate
their efforts on defense, as well, while the Bush administration
pursues the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   He said in the Geneva negotiations the United States would
explore ``a cooperative and stable transition to a greater reliance
on stability-enhancing, cost-effective strategic defense.''
   In fact, Baker said, ``we want to see Soviet defensive military
operations made habitual.''
   He said the Bush administration was emphasing in negotiations
the relative merits of slow-flying weapons, such as cruise missiles
and bombers, which are not suitable for a first strike.
   Baker said the U.S. goal was ``a new relationship in which the
capabilities and incentives to attack first are minimized and the
possibilities of strategic defense are pursued.''
   Meanwhile, Baker used the speech to publicly prod Congress to
drop its objections to the Midgetman, which is designed as a
safeguard against a Soviet first-strike because of its mobility.
   The House has eliminated the $100 million requested by the White
House but the Senate gave its approval for the money. A conference
committee is trying to resolve this and other differences over the
$305 billion defense authorization bill.
   ``We will need to rely upon the deployment of mobile missiles as
a key component of our nuclear modernization program,'' Baker said.
   Referring to the negotiations in Geneva, Baker added, ``Congress
needs now to support START, not undercut it, by funding this
program.''
   Baker initially planned to speak to the Commonwealth Club on
arms control last Thursday. The earthquake caused the postponement.
   Answering questions later on other subjects, Baker reaffirmed
U.S. support for the reunification of East and West Germany in a
way in which East Germans ``will be integrated into a community of
democratic European nations.''
   He acknowledged, however, that the idea of joining the two
Germanies together ``conjures up visions of a return to 1937
borders or perhaps a reunification that is not achieved in peace
and freedom.''
   On another subject, Baker said that despite a sustained effort
to arrange Arab-Israeli negotiations, ``I don't see it as anything
more than a possibility.''

<HEAD>Communist-Linked Union, Party Challenge Solidarity Economic Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist labor leaders spoke out Monday
against the Solidarity-led government's handling of the economy and
a union movement linked to the party began a nationwide protest.
   The four Communist Party ministers in the 24-member Cabinet
approved the government economic program, but union and party
officials have been increasing criticism of the government.
   A meeting in Warsaw of 208 heads of Communist Party committees
from factories nationwide said, ``Working people are painfully
feeling another drop in living standards. ... The country needs a
government social policy that will respect the human right for a
certain minimum'' living standard, the state PAP new agency
reported.
   ``We are against the vision of rapacious capitalism which would
be constructed by handing society's property over to foreign
capital,'' the meeting declared, according to PAP.
   That was a reference to still-sketchy plans to turn some
state-run factories over to the private sector.
   The trade union movement OPZZ, allied with the Communist Party,
began a week-long protest action, placing banners and posters at in
factories and offices.
   It also criticizes the economic reform plan of the Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, former Solidarity journalist.
   OPZZ, which now claims 6 million members, was created by
Communist authorities in 1982 to supplant Solidarity after the
independent union was banned. It claims the government is letting
prices rise uncontrollably, slowing wage increases, and not doing
enough to increase the supply of goods.
   ``We can't catch up with prices; the government must control
them,'' said a poster in Bydgoszcz, and another said, ``High prices
plus soup kitchens equals ever-growing poverty,'' PAP reported.
   Mazowiecki's government plans to fight inflation by halting
subsidies to inefficient state industries and limiting the growth
of credit and wages. Some factories have reacted by raising prices.
   In August, the cost of living rose 40-50 percent after the
previous Communist governemnt removed controls on food prices.

   Several hundred employees of an East German
factory have formed an independent union, a worker spokesman said
Monday, stirring memories of Solidarity's challenge a decade ago to
an equally stern Polish regime.
   In Leipzig, at least 100,000 people marched for democracy.
   Workers at the Wilhelm Pieck electronics factory in Teltow, a
suburb of East Berlin, call their union Reform.
   It is the first independent labor union in this communist
nation, as Solidarity was the first in the Soviet bloc, and
includes the right to strike among its demands. There was no
comment from the government.
   ZDF television in West Germany quoted a Reform spokesman as
saying workers in entire sections of the plant had resigned from
the state Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund labor federation. It
said workers had appealed to comrades in other factories to spread
the new union.
   A crowd estimated at 300,000 by supporters and ``over 100,000''
by the official news agency ADN marched through downtown Leipzig
demanding a more democratic society. For the first time, a Roman
Catholic church was made available to activists for the weekly
demonstrations and rallies.
   Lutheran church sources said police did not interfere with the
peaceful parade. More than 120,000 people filled the streets of
Leipzig a week ago to demand reform.
   Marchers carried placards reading ``Egon, who asked us?'' and
``We want dialogue, not lies.''
   In East Berlin, 3,000 pro-democracy activists held a vigil in
the Gethsemane Lutheran Church to support their comrades in
Leipzig. ADN said about 40,000 people rallied in Schwerin, a
northwestern city, in an event sponsore by the Communist Party to
encourage dialogue between citizens and the leadership.
   Pro-democracy spokesmen said there would be demonstrations
Tuesday when the parliament elected Egon Krenz head of state.
Krenz, 52, took over Wednesday as Communist Party chief, replacing
Erich Honecker, his 77-year-old mentor.
   Honecker, who led the nation for 18 years, was forced from power
by growing unrest at home and the flight of tens of thousands of
East Germans, most of them young, skilled workers, to freedom in
the West.
   Official media have carried calls for reform since Honecker's
departure, but opposition spokesmen remain skeptical about Krenz's
willingness to implement the kind of broad change under way or
comtemplated elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Monday's editions of the Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland
devoted four pages to discussions of reform ``going on all across
the nation.''
   ``Discussions start again'' and ``critical discussion are going
on everywhere,'' it said in a commentary.
   In Bonn, officials said Monday the Krenz regime had agreed to
let about 100 refugees at the West German Embassy in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, join 2,000 East Germans going to the West from
Warsaw, Poland. On Monday, a plane carrying 154 refugees left
Warsaw for West Germany.
   The number of East Germans arriving at West Germany's embassies
in Eastern Europe has continued to grow despite the first signs
that some change may come to their homeland.
   Krenz has accepted an invitation to visit the Soviet Union and
meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and East German media
suggested over the weekend that something might be learned from the
Kremlin leader's reforms. No date for the visit has been announced.
   On the independent union, the Krenz government remained silent.
East Germany's 8.6 million workers have been represented by the
official federation, which is run by a member of the Communist
Party Politburo.
   The party has said it will retain its ``leading role,'' even if
reform comes, and that ngotiations with the opposition are
unnecessary because the nation has enough official organizations
for discussing reform.
   It appeared certain the government would try to prevent the
independent union from gaining the mass support that eventually
carried Solidarity to political power in Poland.
   A statement from union spokesman Roelf Boerger said Reform's
goals include the right to strike. He urged all 6,000 employees of
the Pieck factory, named for East Germany's first president, to
join.
   Boerger said the official federation represents Communist Party
interests and ``doesn't enjoy the confidence of the workers.''
   ``Factories must become more independent and set prices and
salaries themselves,'' he declared. ``In place of patronizing
bureaucratic treatment and being led around like children, we need
worker participation in the factories.''
   His statement, distributed to Western news media in West Berlin,
did not say when the union was founded. It said Reform supports
East Germany's new opposition political groups and favors complete
restructuring of the economy.

   The house that high-performance
plastics helped build was unveiled Monday, a gracious colonial
dwelling with some decidedly 21st century, dream house technology
tucked behind its facade.
   ``We are very excited in sharing with you what we feel the
future of home ownership is,'' Uwe Wascher, vice president of
marketing for GE Plastics, said at the opening of the Living
Environments Concept House at the division's headquarters.
   General Electric officials were quick to point out that the
engineering plastics used in the house have little in common with
the stuff of toys or with the highly futuristic, space-age type of
plastic housing that has been experimented with over the past 40
years.
   About one-third of the light beige house is plastic. The total
cost is estimated at $10 million, but that includes research and
model development.
   The engineering plastics used typically have high melting
points, create little smoke when they burn and have good
sound-deadening properties. But the hime is so airtight it requires
strong ventilating systems.
   The house has curved bay windows, generous decks and huge atrium
windows in front and back. It is clearly in the dream house
category, with such amenities as double showers that convert to
steam rooms, power windows and movable walls.
   Tour guides showed off some of the features, such as a 50-gallon
reservoir in the basement in case of drought, liquid quartz
technology to make naked windows opaque and refrigeration systems
set into the kitchen walls.
   Cutaway sections throughout the house showed the plastics molded
into walls and floors and, in one bathroom, the tub was sliced in
two, right down to a bisected rubber duck.
   GE officials say the house will serve as a laboratory to explore
use of engineering polymers in construction markets, but also
contains some practical concepts that are already in use. Roof tile
panels of high-performance plastics are already on the market, as
are some of the window units, which feature snap-in moldings.
   ``You get used to it. You don't paint it, you just replace it,''
said tour guide Rob Gillette.
   The 3,000-square-foot, two-story house, with a split-level
basement, was built for a family of four, with a large master
bedroom luxuriously appointed with a Jacuzzi, window seat and
state-of-the-art Japanese toilets featuring a built-in exhaust fan
and automatic bidet.
   Company officials conceded it will be some time before all of
the innovations in the concept house become commonplace.
   ``We don't think we can change the industry overnight,'' Dickens
said.
   The plastics used in the building are now two to 10 times more
expensive than traditional building materials, but GE expects them
to become competitive as builders look toward prefabricated and
component assembly to hold down costs.
   Eventually, the plastic construction, which may feature prefab
wall panels complete wmth insulation and siding that snaps
together, will provide a more efficient way of building, company
officials said.
   More than 45,000 pounds of plastics are used in the house in
such areas as the roof, windows, siding, plumbing, foundation and
electrical and mechanical systems.
   But much of the visible material in the house is unabashedly
traditionl, such as the maple floors, and company officials said
that was intentional.
   ``We never intended to replace all wood, glass, stone and
steel,'' Wascher said.

<TEXT>
   A storm system moving inland from the Gulf of Alaska spread rain
across much of the northern and central Pacific Coast region
Monday, with some locally heavy downpours.
   Heavy rain in the San Francisco Bay area combined with the soil
movements of last week's earthquake to increase the danger of
mudslides. One landslide closed a section of California 17 in Santa
Clara County, southeast of San Francisco, state officials reported.
   Rain fell across the Pacific Northwest and the northern half of
California during the afternoon. Thunderstorms produced wind gusts
to 66 mph at Redding, Calif., and thunderstorms also were reported
in the area of Sacramento, Calif.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.80
inches at Crescent City, Calif., 1.14 inches at San Francisco and
1.09 inches at Redding, Calif.
   Inland, a winter storm warning was posted into Tuesday for
elevations above 7,000 feet in the Lake Tahoe and Truckee area of
California and Nevada, where up to 2 feet of snow was possible.
   A winter storm warning also was posted for elevations above
7,000 feet in the northern Sierra Nevada range, and the Mount
Shasta and Siskiyou mountain region of northern California.
   A gale warning was in effect along the northern California
coast, and a high wind warning was issued in Nevada for the Reno
and Carson City area. Wind gusted to 67 mph at Reno during the
morning.
   Indian summer weather prevailed across the central part of the
nation with temperatures warming into the 70s, and Texas warmed
into the 80s.
   Temperatures warmed into the 50s and 60s in the East, with
readings in the 70s across the Southeast, a day after a cold snap
that saw temperatures in the 30s as far south as northern Florida.
   Only vestiges of the cold air remained Monday in Florida, where
Miami had a record overnight low of 61, and Fort Myers tied its
record of 55.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 13 degrees above zero
at Gunnison, Colo.

   President Bush is ``like all men now, he
doesn't like confrontation'' and seldom argues at home, first lady
Barbara Bush said in a television interview broadcast Monday.
   Mrs. Bush, interviewed by entertainer Oprah Winfrey, also said a
role model is former first lady Lady Bird Johnson, that she seldom
worries about security and that the White House is ``the most
beautiful place in the world.''
   Asked by Winfrey whether she and the president argued, Mrs. Bush
responded: ``Not much, after 44 years'' of marriage. ``We sort of
grew up together.''
   ``He listens,'' she continued. ``He's like all men now, he
doesn't like confrontation. It's very hard to argue when only one
fellow will argue.''
   ``I'm feistier than George,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush said that she was ``the enforcer'' in the Bush
household when their five children were growing up, disciplining
them and even spanking them on occasion.
   ``I didn't spank hard, but I spanked,'' she said.
   ``I gave them enormous stablity (and) a lot of advice, none of
which they took,'' she said.
   She said that listening to her children was tedious at times,
``mine were so boring, they wanted to tell you the whole movie.''
   And, before selecting their present wives, her four sons
sometimes brought girlfriends home who were ``real dogs,'' Mrs.
Bush said. ``I treated them like they were neat nice people.''
   The first lady's press secretary, Anna Perez, said the interview
for the syndicated television show was taped two weeks earlier.
   Asked whom she most admired among other first ladies, Mrs. Bush
said, ``I think most often of Lady Bird Johnson. I've known her for
a number of years ... she lived a life very much like I lived.''
   ``She said ... if you can help people by talking about your
cause and making people aware of it, and if by chance it reflects
well on your husband, that's what life is all about. I like that.''
   She also praised Betty Ford for being ``very courageous'' and
called Nancy Reagan a ``very close friend. ... She really made the
White House sparkle. She fixed the plumbing and the electricity.
All those things you take for granted that I didn't have to do.''
   ``And I kind of admired old Bess (Truman). She did what she
wanted.''
   Asked about her concerns for the safety of her family,
especially in light of recent alleged threats from Colombian drug
lords, Mrs. Bush said: ``Why waste your time?''
   ``I have a great belief in God and enormous belief in the Secret
Service, in that order,'' she said.

   Right-wing extremists yelling that the Holocaust
was a lie had a shouting match Monday with a concentration camp
survivor outside an international conference on Nazi war crimes.
   ``You are Nazis! You are Nazi terrorists!'' shouted Rabbi Hugo
Gryn. ``You probably would have killed me.''
   Experts from the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain
had to pass the 14 protesters who were waving British flags,
shouting ``Six Million Lies!'' and passing out newspapers headlined
``Holocaust Story An Evil Hoax'' at the entrance to the Royal
Westminster Hotel.
   For Gryn of the West London Synagogue, who was born 59 years ago
in Czechoslovakia and spent 1944-45 in the Birkenau concentration
camp, it was too much.
   ``I lost my temper,'' he said. ``They're really obscene and
they're young, and the awful thing is, they would have put in the
gas pellets. They're the haters. What breeds them?''
   The clash highlighted some of the opposition to changing British
law to allow prosecution of alleged Nazi war criminals living in
Britain, the theme of a conference called ``Time For Justice''
sponsored by the All-Party Parliamentary War Crimes Group.
   Sir Thomas Hetherington, coauthor of a report recommending the
prosecution of alleged war criminals, said there is enough evidence
to prosecute three people living in Britain, whom he refused to
identify.
   He said three other cases that had been investigated in detail
needed further inquiries and another 75 cases should be
investigated. He also appealed for information on 46 alleged war
criminals whom his inquiry team had been unable to trace.
   ``I am quite unshaken on this, that having weighed all the pros
and cons, we in this country ought to legislate to take the
necessary jurisdictional powers,'' Hetherington said.
   Efriam Zuroff of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center
said he had turned over the name of one more alleged Nazi war
criminal living in Britain to the British Home office on Monday.
   ``We're talking about a person who served in a unit which
carried out the mass murder of thousands upon thousands of innocent
men, women and children,'' he said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
television interview. He did not identify the person.
   Parliament is due to debate the war crimes report this autumn
and vote on whether to introduce legislation enabling prosecutions
to take place.
   Labor lawmaker Merlyn Rees, chairman of the Parliamentary War
Crimes Group, predicted victory for those favoring prosecution
would not be easy.
   ``I believe there will be those, particularly among the younger
generation, perhaps among the older generation, too, who will say
it is all 50 years ago,'' he said.
   Opening the conference on behalf of Home Secretary Douglas Hurd,
Home Office Minister John Patten gave a hint of the government's
position saying: ``It is his view and it is my view that we should
certainly forgive, but we should certainly not forget.''
   Patten led a string of condemnations of the flag-waving
protesters, saying they were trying ``to clothe their own attempts
to rewrite history in some form of public acceptance.''
   He added: ``I think what they are doing outside is perfectly
disgusting and I condemn it utterly in every way.''
   One demonstrator, Richard Edmonds, said they were all members of
the British National Party, a small white supremacist party.
   ``The gas chambers were lies produced by Britain and America to
justify their activities in World War II,'' Edmonds said. ``These
(war crimes) trials are absolutely wicked. They are trials based on
evidence of the KGB, and who believes them?''
   If Parliament approves legislation, Britain would be following
the United States, Canada, Australia, East Germany and West Germany
in prosecuting war criminals.
   ``It truly is an issue which should have no territorial
boundaries,'' said Neal Sher, director of the Office of Special
Investigation at the U.S. Justice Department.
   He said more than 1,200 people had been brought to the attention
of U.S. authorities. Using existing laws on extradition and
deportation, more than 30 war criminals had been kicked out, 35
others had been stripped of U.S. citizenship and 25 cases were in
the courts, he said.
   Sher stressed the importance of prosecuting all Nazi war
criminals, even the ``small fry.'' But he guessed that possibly
10,000 ``small fry'' Nazi criminals living in the United States
were getting away with their crimes because nobody knows who they
are.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill to Make Abandoned Mines Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Monday that
expands the federal government's program to restore abandoned coal
mines to a safe and environmentally acceptable condition.
   The bill, approved 281-63 but opposed by the White House,
extends through fiscal year 2007 the Interior Department's
authority to collect fees on coal under the 1977 Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act.
   But it also makes changes in how the money is used, reduces the
fees in states that have completed all their abandoned mine
reclamation projects and creates a fund for reclamation of
abandoned non-coal mines.
   The legislation now goes to the Senate.
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who led the opposition to the bill,
said House action was ``extremely premature'' because the 1977 act
was not due to expire until 1992. He said he opposed the expansion
of reclamation efforts to non-coal mine sites and said more time
should be given to get reports from agencies involved in mine
reclamation.
   He accused the proponents, headed by Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.,
chairman of the House Interior Committee, of rushing the bill and
said it was ``not fiscally responsible'' to expand the provisions
of the 1977 law.
   ``The fund should be narrowed, not expanded,'' said Craig.
   Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., who led floor debate for the bill,
said that despite the work to remove scars left by previous mining
practices the number of abandoned sites ``is still overwhelming.''
He acknowledged that the problems addressed by the bill are
regional ones but said that many compromises were made to satisfy
the western states.
   Rep. Carl Perkins, D-Ky., said ``thousands of acres are still in
need'' of reclamation and spoke graphically of the landslide
problems caused by the combination of flooding and abandoned mines.
   Fees mandated by the legislation are used to pay for reclamation
of mine sites abandoned before 1977 when no one else has the
responsibility under federal or state law.
   The fees would be unchanged under the bill _ 35 cents per ton
for surface-mined coal, 15 cents a ton for underground coal and 10
cents a ton for a type of coal known as lignite, or brown coal.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending
collection of coal reclamation fees beyond 1992 would increase
federal revenues by $234 million in 1993 and $213 million in 1994,
but that fee compliance activities in those two years would
increase outlays by $11 million.
   The new abandoned non-coal mine reclamation fund would total $6
million in fiscal 1991 through 1994.

   A consultant supplied a Texas company with
details of closed sessions of the U.S. Postal Service's governing
board, according to testimony at a criminal trial Monday.
   Robert Buzard, president of Electrocom Automation Inc. of
Arlington, Texas, testified that his firm hired lobbyist Mark Bragg
in the company's effort in 1985 to win hundreds of millions of
dollars in postal contracts.
   Bragg's business partner at the time was Lyn Nofziger, the
former White House political director in the Reagan administration
who was convicted of illegal lobbying in matters unrelated to the
postal service. Nofziger's conviction was overturned by a federal
appeals court in June. Bragg was a co-defendant at Nofziger's trial
and was acquitted.
   Electrocom's competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc., and two of
REI's top officers, are on trial in U.S. District Court for
conspiring to defraud the postal service in connection with the
award of automation contracts.
   Buzard testified that Electrocom hired Bragg for about a year
``to keep the playing field level'' in the competition with REI.
   At the time, REI had hired a politically well-connected
consultant, John Gnau, at the suggestion of then-board of governors
vice chairman Peter Voss. Voss later pleaded guilty to taking an
illegal gratuity from Gnau in connection with the competition for
the postal automation equipment.
   During one hectic week in the competition with REI in November
1985, Buzard said Bragg supplied him with names of governors who in
a closed session had given speeches in support of Electrocom.
   Buzard also acknowledged it was Bragg who reported to him that
REI's closed-door presentation to the board on the automation
contract hadn't been persuasive and had provided ``nothing new.''
   Buzard sought to deemphasize the information Bragg provided,
saying it dealt with the ``quality, not content'' of board of
governors' meetings.
   Under questioning from REI legal counsel John Cooney, Buzard
said he hadn't been aware the information Bragg was providing was
from meetings that were closed.
   Buzard said he never asked and that Bragg never said where he
got his information about board meetings.
   Buzard acknowledged that in 1986 he refused to identify Bragg by
name to postal inspectors investigating allegations of contract
irregularities. Buzard simply told them that Electrocom had hired a
Washington consultant who was ``well-placed.''
   Buzard said he refused to identify Bragg because the consultant
didn't want the identity of his clients disclosed.
   Electrocom has been awarded the work for the automation
equipment.
   In a brief interview, Bragg said he was unfamiliar with Buzard's
testimony and so would have no immediate comment.
   Outside the courtroom, Buzard declined to say how much
Electrocom had paid Bragg.

   The fading popularity of President
Robert Mugabe's governing party will be tested in four special
parliamentary elections beginning Tuesday.
   Six candidates opposed to Mugabe's avowed aim of a one-party
state in one of Africa's few Western-style democracies will
challenge four contenders from the governing Zimbabwe African
National Union.
   The outcome from the elections in rural areas will be a
barometer of support for Mugabe's movement. Most of the country's 9
million people live in such areas.
   The by-elections were set for Tuesday and Wednesday in the
parliamentary districts of Chirumanzu, Gwanda, Kariba and Masvingo
North. Results are expected to be announced Thursday.
   The voting comes at a time of mounting disenchantment with a
government that took over when the British colony of Rhodesia
gained independence as Zimbabwe in 1980.
   Many Zimbabweans are now upset about reports of top-level
corruption and self-aggrandizement by politicians who preach
egalitarian ideals.
   Many in this country also complain about rising prices and
shortages of basic commodities, mounting unemployment and a
breakdown in public services.
   Earlier this month, the University of Zimbabwe was closed after
violent anti-government demonstrations. At least 15 students
remained in detention.
   The country's top labor leader, Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions secretary-general Morgan Tsvangirai, was also detained after
he supported the students.
   In addition, at least 11 officials of the opposition Zimbabwe
Unity Movement who campaigned for this week's by-election in the
northwest Kariba constituency were detained on unspecified
allegations.
   At least 150,000 voters have registered for the by-elections,
which will send candidates to the 100-member National Assembly. The
seats were left vacant by the resignations of three politicians
linked to official corruption and another politician who died.
   Mugabe's party is supported by all but two lawmakers in the
National Assembly and the 40-seat Senate.
   The leader of the Unity Movement, Edgar Tekere, holds one seat
and an independent the other. Tekere's movement vows to crush
official corruption, attract foreign investment to create new jobs,
and to keep Zimbabwe a multiparty socialist democracy.
   Mugabe says he wants Zimbabwe transformed into a one-party state
after general elections before April next year. To legally achieve
his aim, he needs the unanimous support of Parliament.

   President Bush took an
unseasonably balmy afternoon off from work on Monday to play golf
and his spokesman said anyone begrudging him the outing ``is just
silly.''
   Bush played with champion golfer Lee Trevino, House Minority
Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., and Mo Bandy, a country singer.
   Also playing with president, but in another foursome, were
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Treasury Secretary
Nicolas Brady, Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa., and golf pro Doug
Sanders.
   Bush, who flew by helicopter from the White House to the Andrews
Air Force Base golf course, about 10 miles away, miffed his first
drive on the first hole; he took it again and the second one
brought applause from spectators.
   ``We will edit out that first one,'' Trevino said.
   The president declined to answer questions shouted at him at one
point by reporters on the recent failed Panama coup, saying ``I
never discuss intelligence matters on the golf course.''
   He also said it was too beautiful a day to take questions _
sunny and with temperatures in the upper 60s.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater shrugged off
questions at his daily news briefing about whether the president
should be taking the day off with so many national problems
pressing.
   ``The president works 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And for
anyone to begrudge him an afternoon of golf is just silly,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush, after picking up his ball following two missed putts on
the 18th hole, told reporters: ``Well, here's the way it worked
out, just for the sports world commentators here:
   ``On the front side, the match headed by Lee Trevino won. I
happened to be a member of that team. And on the backside, the
match headed by Doug Sanders won. I was lucky enough to be on that
team.''
   Bush disclosed no scores. Schulze was seen handing Bush a $10
bill as they walked off.
   Mrs. Bush joined the group in mid-afternoon and served as a
gallery. She walked the course while Bush and the other men relied
on golf carts to get around.

   Christy Andrews, who weighed just 15 ounces
when she was born three months prematurely and was given little
chance of survival, celebrates her first birthday Friday.
   ``She's doing extremely well,'' Christy's 28-year-old mother,
Leslie Andrews, said Monday.
   When she was born Oct. 27, the baby measured 10 inches.
Specialists at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center gave her a less
than a 5 percent chance of survival. She was hospitalized for five
months before her discharge in March.
   Today, the brown-haired, brown-eyed infant weighs a little more
than 12 pounds and is 23 inches high.
   ``Her survival and the fact that she has done medically so well
is remarkable. When people hear about her, they can't believe it,''
said Dr. Margaret Fernandes D'Souza, director of the intensive care
unit for newborns.
   Christy's survival boosted morale among nurses and other staff
members in the unit, where another infant who was as small as
Christy at birth is recovering, the doctor said.
   ``It's made us feel really good,'' said Fernandes D'Souza, who
has cared for Christy since the child's birth. ``... This has shown
us even if we save one out of 20, it's worth it.''
   Mrs. Andrews said she no longer thinks of her child as the
``miracle baby,'' as the infant was called at the hospital. But she
remembered her daughter's struggle for life recently when she read
a journal she began when the girl was nine days old.
   ``It just seems like so long ago,'' said Mrs. Andrews. ``It
seems like a different lifetime _ a different baby.''
   The past year hasn't been easy for the family, which is
struggling to pay about $7,000 in hospital bills not covered by
insurance.
   Mrs. Andrews said the family plans a quiet, private party for
Christy on Friday at their home in Tabernacle, 25 miles southeast
of Camden, which is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.
   ``She's not like your typical 1-year-old who can sit there and
open gifts,'' said Mrs. Andrews, who also has a 9-year-old
daughter, Michelle. ``Maybe we'll save that for her second
birthday.''
   Christy suffered a urinary tract infection during the summer,
but otherwise has been relatively healthy since her release from
the hospital. Medical checkups have been scaled back from once a
week to once a month.
   She is beginning to roll over on her stomach and can sit up with
a boost, her mother said. Her social skills are equivalent to an
8-or 9-month-old baby and her speech and physical development are
on the level of a 6-month-old.
   The baby has about an 80 percent chance of living a normal life,
but will require constant medical attention in her early years,
said Fernandez D'Souza.
   Because of lung damage, Christy will have to breathe from a
oxygen tank for several more months, and will continue to be fed
intravenously until she gains more weight.
   Mrs. Andrews gives the child chest therapy four times a day to
help her breathe, and a nurse helps care for Christy eight hours
each week. A therapist will continue to visit once a week until the
child is 3 years old to monitor her speech, hearing and motor
development.
   ``It's taken her a long time to catch up,'' Mrs. Andrews said.
``She's pretty behind where she should be.''

   Buck Helm astounded his doctors Monday by
nodding his head to show he had no pain, despite being trapped for
90 hours in his tiny car under tons of concrete.
   ``In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now,
he will be out of the woods,'' said Dr. Floyd Huen, medical
director at Highland General Hospital.
   ``His love for us and our love for him is one of the major
things that kept him going,'' his former wife, Lorrie, said at a
hospital news conference Monday also attended by three of his
children.
   ``Buck is a strong-willed man. For him to survive this long he
has proved it,'' she said, adding later, ``He's always been there
when I needed him, and this is when he needs us.''
   A wave of joy spread through the hospital at news of Helm's
condition, Huen said.
   ``When he was asked about whether he was hurting anywhere, he
shook his head and everbody was incredulous,'' Huen said.
   Helm's condition was upgraded Monday from critical to very
serious and may improve again to serious, Huen said, adding that
Helm was likely to spend two or three more days on a respirator.
   Helm, 57, had been trapped in his silver Chevrolet Sprint under
tons of steel and concrete since the earthquake Tuesday toppled a
double-decker section of Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   A ship's clerk at the Port of Oakland's Charles P. Hamilton
Terminal at the foot of Market Street, Helm was headed up the
freeway to Emeryville to a legal poker parlor when the quake hit,
dockworkers said.
   And in the freeway rubble is where he remained, slumped on his
right side along the front seat, until rescue workers freed him
Saturday.
   Helm's kidneys, which doctors had feared were so severley
damaged by dehydration that he might need dialysis the rest of his
life, appeared to be resuming normal function, Huen said.
   When a person is severely dehydrated, the kidneys shut down to
preserve the fluids in the body, Huen said. However, doctors had
feared that byproducts of muscle damage could have poisoned the
kidneys.
   ``In his case, he has responded so quickly we feel it was just
severe dehydration,'' Huen said.
   Doctors felt Helm's recovery was coming along so well that they
began feeding him through a tube inserted in his stomach and gave
him a pencil and a tablet of paper to communicate.
   Helm, 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, can't talk because a respirator
tube has been run down his throat.
   However, the broken ribs and chest wall separation appear to be
mending and doctors have been lowering the amount of oxygen
delivered through the respirator, Huen said.
   Mrs. Helm said she has read newspaper accounts of the earthquake
to him, and he understands although he drifts in and out of
consciousness. He communicates by nodding, blinking, squeezing her
hand, she said.
   The night before the earthquake, Helm apparently slept, as he
usually did, in his rusty yellow Chevrolet panel truck parked at
the docks.
   On the left side of the truck, Helm had painted in orange the
words ``Weaverville Flash,'' referring to the little logging town
250 miles away in the Trinity Mountains of Northern California
where he drove every weekend to be with his children.
   On the right side, he painted a cartoon rabbit and ``Desirees's
Delight,'' after his 12-year-old daughter.
   ``He always calls me his rabbit,'' Desiree said at the news
conference. ``I love him.''
   Inside the van, Helm had a mattress, a Snoopy sleeping bag, two
alarm clocks, some clothes, and a panel of photographs of his
children, including one of a small child in a huge pair of football
shoulderpads.
   Before work, Helm usually drove to a YMCA to wash up, then
arrived at his job a little before 8 a.m., said Ralph Bucher, chief
clerk at the terminal.
   ``He was a Weaverville local,'' said Bucher. ``He has tried
living down in this area. He had several business enterprises
around Alameda. I believe he had a sandwich shop and a rent-a-wreck
type auto rental which kind of went sour.''
   Helm worked out of a small cubicle paneled in tan T-111 siding,
where he checked through the big trucks hauling shipping containers
bound for overseas.
   Inside the cubicle, there is nothing to identify Helm. Just a
computer terminal, a digital read-out for the truck scale outside,
and a printer for papers directing truckdrivers with their loads.
   During his coffee break, Helm routinely joined the other ship's
clerks at a round table in the back of a mobile office to play
tonk, the card game of the docks, at a quarter a hand.
   At lunchtime, none of the other clerks knew where Helm went, but
he might have taken a walk, because he was trying to lose weight,
said clerk Joe Marotto.
   Some of the ship's clerks took off early to watch the World
Series, but Helm said he was going to Emeryville to the Oaks Club
to play poker, ship's clerk Roger Phelps said.
   Maybe he felt lucky, because that day he'd been a winner at
tonk, ship's clerk Enrique Roman said.
   Bucher said Helm's car had more than 200,000 miles logged from
the commute to and from Weaverville. ``You look at it and think
that any collision would kill the occupant.''

<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Monday
that President Bush is exercising necessary prudence in vowing to
keep some chemical arms in U.S. arsenals until all such weapons are
eliminated worldwide.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, in his third
consecutive speech on the issue, said the Bush's decision
represents a ``major step backward'' that ``can only result in
delay and confusion'' at talks in Geneva aimed at banning chemical
arms.
   Dole, responding to the criticism by Mitchell and other
Democrats, said Bush only seeks to ``keep a deterrent, a modern and
credible deterrent, until we are certain there is worldwide
participation in a treaty banning chemical weapons.''
   ``It seems to me this is a reasonaable and responsible policy,''
the Kansas Republican said.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that the U.S. position _ and that of
other Western powers _ has been that a global ban on the production
of chemical weapons would take effect soon after a treaty entered
into force.
   Mitchell complained there is evidence, contained in published
reports not denied by the White House, that the United States will
continue to produce modern chemical weapons for eight years or more
after a treaty goes into effect, updating the chemical weapons
stockpile even as its overall size is reduced.
   Disputes over Bush's policy could cause such delay at the Geneva
talks ``that the opportunity to achieve progress on a global ban on
chemical weapons will be lost, perhaps forever,'' Mitchell asserted.
   ``The efforts of other countries to attain this capability will
proceed, while the arms control process will be stalled as the
result of American indecision and inconsistency,'' he said.
   But Dole argued tghat, ``We need some insurance in case we do
not get worldwide participation. Keeping our chemical deterrent
credible will provide us with that insurance.''
   ``As much as we may want to see arms control progress in the
area of chemical weapons and elsewhere, the United States needs to
look for action, not words, especially when U.S. national security
is involved,'' Dole said.
   In an address to the United Nations Security Council last month,
Bush announced that as part of a global treaty banning chemical
weapons the United States would reduce its stockpiles of such
weapons by 98 peercent over eight years if the Soviet Union did the
same.
   The president said the United States would eliminate the
remaining 2 percent at the 10th year, but only if all other nations
had eliminated their chemical weapons capability.
   Shortly after Bush's speech, press reports quoted unnamed
administration officials as saying the United States would produce
modern Bigeye chemical weapons throughout the reduction period to
make sure the reduced stocks of such arms are as potent as possible.
   Mitchell referred to these reports and asked: ``How can the
United States possibly expect other countries to observe a ban on
production if we reserve to ourselves the right to ignore a ban?''
   Mitchell said other nations would insist on such production
rights for themselves.
   ``This means that verifying a chemical weapons ban, hard enough
under the best of conditions, will become enormously more
difficult,'' he said.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Reaches Belgian Parliament After 16-Year Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate opens debate Tuesday on a
bill to legalize abortion in a showdown that has been put off for
16 years by legislative maneuvers in this predominantly Roman
Catholic country.
   The issue has divided the center-left government of Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens.
   It the Senate approves the bill, and a vote could be held by
Friday, the measure then goes to the more powerful Chamber of
Deputies.
   The measure would allow abortions during the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy for ``women in distress.''
   Abortions have been illegal in Belgium for more than 100 years
but in 1973 pro-abortion lawmakers sought to introduce legislation
changing the law. Catholic legislators successfully blocked all
efforts to bring the issue before Parliament until this year.
   The Senate's justice and public health committees voted to
change the law that bans abortions and provides for a penalty of up
to five years jail for women who have an abortion and those who
perform it.
   In the committees the Socialists voted for legalizing abortion
while Christian Democrats voted against.
   The dispute has divided Martens' five-party coalition of
Socialists and Christian Democrats, each split into Dutch and
French-speaking factions, and the Flemish People's Union.
   The greatest opposition comes from Martens' Dutch-speaking
Christian Democrats, Belgium's largest single political force.
   Many political observers believe the Christian Democrats are
willing to risk the fate of Martens' government on the outcome.
   Opinion polls have shown a majaority of Belgians favor
legalizing abortions.
   Although the procedure is banned, enforcement of the law has
been spotty and the courts have been lenient to those convicted of
violating the measure.
   It is estimated that 16,000 women have abortions in Belgium each
year and many more go to neighboring Holland, where abortions are
legal.
   On the eve of the parliamentary debate, there were indications
some Christian Democrat legislators would approve a change that
would approve abortions if granted by a special panel that would
hold hearings with the women seeking abortions.
   Pro-abortion forces reject such a compromise, saying the
decision must be made only by the woman and her doctor.

   The auction of the lifetime hoard of
an eccentric antiques collector brought nearly $1.2 million on the
first of six days Monday.
   Ronald Summerfield collected more than 10,000 items of china,
glass, ceramics, clocks, jewelry, furniture, books, prints and
paintings.
   When he died last spring at age 73, his three-story house in
Cheltenham, western England, was so crammed with treasures that an
ambulance crew lowered his body through an upstairs window with a
winch rather than trying to get it down the cluttered stairs.
   Christie's said the jewelry, silverware, portrait miniatures,
furniture and decorative art objects laid out Monday at the
Cheltenham racecourse drew bids from about 300 people and brought
in almost $1.2 million.
   About 1,300 of the 4,000 lots were sold Monday and the top price
of $17,600 was paid for a regency table, the auction house said.
   The auction continues Tuesday with objects d'art, barometers and
ceramics. The total is expected to surpass the pre-sale estimate of
$3 million.
   Just before his death, Summerfield created a trust to give most
of his fortune to arts charities.

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin admitted Monday the Krasnoyarsk radar
station violates the Soviet-U.S. ABM treaty and offered to
negotiate an end to the NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances.
   In a major foreign policy speech in the Soviet legislature,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also criticized the
decision by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1979 to send Soviet soldiers into
Afghanistan. He said it involved ``gross violations of our own
laws, intra-party and civil norms and ethics.''
   ``A decision that had very serious consequences for our country
was made behind the back of the party and the people,'' he said.
   About the military alliances, Shevardnadze said: ``We are
prepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-political
blocs in Europe on a mutual basis,'' but added that ``all our
obligations remain in force'' despite recent changes in Eastern
Europe.
   Poland and Hungary have moved away from one-party Communist rule
in recent months and the Soviet Union has made no move to stop
them. Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union would observe strict
principles of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''
   He said the Soviet Union is prepared to liquidate all foreign
bases and withdraw its military forces to its own territory by the
year 2000. What the conditions for such a withdrawal would be was
not clear.
   Shevardnadze said the radar station in Siberia would be
dismantled. He said it took Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government four
years to determine that its location violated the 1972 treaty, as
Western arms experts contended.
   As the Soviet Union tried to move forward on arms treaties based
on the ABM pact, ``there stood the station, the size of an Egyptian
pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABM
treaty,'' Shevardnadze declared.
   Shevardnadze said that the decision to dismantle the giant,
phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk was criticized within the country
as going against the Soviet Union's interest.
   In fact, he said, ``We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the
way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons, and we're
gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question
of American installations in Greenland and England which were
modernized, as we understand, in violation of the treaty.''
   The United States has claimed the treaty does not apply to its
modernization of the stations in Thule, Greenland, and Fylingdales
Moor, England, because they were in place before the ABM accord was
signed.
   In Washington, the Bush administration welcomed Shevardnadze's
admission.
   ``It reflects a different kind of mindset,'' said a U.S.
official. ``It's encouraging. It builds a degree of confidence, it
builds a degree of trust,'' he told reporters at a briefing on an
arms control speech Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
making in San Francisco. Ground rules of the briefing prevent use
of the official's name.
   After Shevardnadze and Baker met last month in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., they said in a joint statement: ``The Soviet Union stated
that, guided by its long-standing goal of strengthening the ABM
treaty regime, it had decided to completely dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk radar station. The U.S. side expressed satisfaction
with this announcement.''
   Shevardnadze, in a news conference at Jackson Hole, told
reporters: `We have decided to fully dismantle that facility, and
we expect that the U.S. side, too, will act in order to remove our
concern with respect to its radars in Greenland and Great Britain.''
   The Soviet government has offered repeatedly to turn over the
Siberian radar to a civilian agency and partially dismantle it, but
always stopped short of admitting the station violated provisions
of the ABM treaty.
   The United States rejected as unsatisfactory any plan short of
complete dismantling of the station, saying the ABM treaty
prohibited the deployment of large radar stations capable of giving
early warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery
of the U.S. or Soviet territory.
   The Krasnoyarsk station is deep within Soviet Siberia, several
hundred miles north of the Chinese border.
   The dispute was among the differences that soured U.S.-Soviet
arms control talks for years.
   It was not the first time high-placed Soviets have disclosed
that the decision to intervene in Afghanistan was made by a small
circle around the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. But it had
not previously been characterized by a government spokesman as an
outright violation of law.
   Shevardnadze noted that for the first time in many years, ``Not
a single Soviet soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will
participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world.''
   He said the Soviet Union is prepared to liquidate all its
foreign bases and withdraw its military forces to within its own
territory by the year 2000. It was not clear what the condition
would be for such a withdrawal.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, seeking to smooth relations
with Congress, said Monday he has ``no differences at all'' with
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the ground
rules for covert actions overseas.
   Bush grew testy when questioned by reporters about the issue at
the end of a 3{-hour golf outing at Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland.
   Bush complained to Senate Republican leaders in private last
week about congressional restrictions on actions by U.S. agents
overseas.
   The president reportedly griped that the restrictions, if
narrowly interpreted, could have required American officials to
warn Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in advance of any
impending coup that could endanger his life.
   Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., the chairman of the intelligence
panel, responded angrily Sunday night, saying ``the American people
are being deliberately misled'' by selective leaks of ``highly
classified correspondence.''
   But Bush told reporters, ``I have no differences at all with Mr.
Boren on all of this, and he knows it, and we know it, and that's a
good thing for the whole situation.''
   Asked specifically about Boren's complaint about leaks, Bush
replied: ``He's in good shape. He and I are thinking together on
these things.''
   Bush brushed aside another question about rewriting the
intelligence guidelines.
   ``Let me tell you something,'' said the president, who was once
director of the Central Intelligence Agency. ``I don't discuss
intelligence matters. It's just not intelligence if you do that.
That's not the way you treat it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier that Bush
and Boren had ``discussed the whole question of micromanagement and
of intelligence activities in these areas. The president feels that
any differences they may have had have been ironed out.''
   Fitzwater said Bush was working with Boren and the committee on
possible changes, but added, ``There will be no change in the ban
on assassinations _ bar none.''
   A policy imposed by then-President Gerald Ford in 1976 bars
American agents from taking part in any effort to assassinate
foreign leaders.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has complained that Intelligence
Committee guidelines inhibited the administration's flexibility in
responding to events in Panama leading up to the failed attempt
Oct. 3 to oust Noriega, who is under federal indictment in Florida
on charges of drug trafficking.
   Boren said the report of Bush's complaints about the policy was
a ``selective leak'' that distorted the situation at the time of
his panel's October 1988 letter to then-President Ronald Reagan.
   While not acknowledging details of the policy, Boren said his
letter merely restated the committee's understanding of CIA
guidelines to carry out a 14-year-old ban on U.S. involvement in
assassinations of foreign leaders.
   ``Our letter stated their policy as it had been told to us,''
said a committee source.
   Boren, in a statement, said, ``The plain truth is, there are
ambiguities in the record'' on both the congressional and executive
side.

   The trial of a police officer who killed a black
motorcyclist, sparking three days of racial violence, opened Monday
with the defense demanding the case be moved as demonstrators
clashed outside.
   Colombian-born Miami officer William Lozano faces two
manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 shooting of the motorcylist
Clement Lloyd, 23, as he was being chased by police, and the death
of his passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, who was fatally injured when
the motorcycle crashed.
   While small groups of black and Hispanic demonstrators faced off
outside the Dade County courthouse, attorneys and spectators inside
were put through two sets of metal detectors and had bags and
briefcases searched.
   Attorneys spent Monday selecting potential jurors. They finished
midway through the initial screening process and expected to
continue jury selection all day Tuesday.
   Earlier, defense attorney Roy Black listed for Dade Circuit
Judge Joseph Farina the extraordinary measures adopted by local
police worried about a violent reaction to the trial. Police have
bought 700 gas masks and made arrangements for use of two armored
personnel carriers.
   ``I can't remember any trial in which it was necessary to buy
armored personnel carriers to prepare for it,'' Black said, arguing
the trial must be moved. ``We can't prevent a riot, but we can
ensure jurors are not worried about it.''
   Four times this decade, police slayings of black men or
subsequent innocent verdicts in their trials have touched off
racial violence in Miami. As a result, Black said jurors in Miami
might be afraid to acquit Lozano and touch off new rioting.
   Potential jurors had to pass by two small groups of
demonstrators on the courthouse steps Monday, with blacks carrying
signs such as ``Stop Killing Black Men,'' while Hispanics, some of
them members of Lozano's family, waved Colombia's flag. One man,
Billy Hardemon, was arrested when he tried to force his way past
police guarding the courthouse doorway.
   John Hogan, lead prosecutor for the state, said he was not
concerned about the tension affecting jurors.
   ``The test is not whether they have heard of the case, the test
is whether or not they can base a decision on the evidence in
court,'' Hogan told the judge. ``We've been able to get juries in
other high publicity cases here in Dade County.''
   Attorneys estimated it could take weeks of addressing pre-trial
motions before the actual trial testimony begins.
   Outside the courtroom, Patricia Lloyd, sister of the slain
motorcyclist, called for the black community not to prjudge the
trial.
   ``Stay calm and let the trial go on,'' Ms. Lloyd said. ``I hope
he gets convicted.''
   Lozano's brother, Jairo Lozano, also a Miami policeman, said the
demonstrations and Miami's history make it impossible to find an
impartial jury.
   ``He will not get a fair trial here in Miami,'' Jairo Lozano
said. ``But if they move the trial out of Dade County, justice will
be done, because what he did was in self-defense.''
   Lozano said he fired at Lloyd because the speeding motorcycle
headed straight for him. Lloyd died instantly of a bullet to the
head, while Blanchard died of head injuries suffered in the crash.
   The slaying touched off burning and looting in predominantly
black neighborhoods. One person was killed, 11 were wounded by
gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before the Miami
area was host to the Super Bowl.
   Tensions, especially between blacks and Hispanics, remained high
after the violence.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir tried to play
down tensions with the Bush administration Monday after his aides
reportedly said he may cancel a visit to Washington over
differences on how to achieve peace.
   Maariv, a leading Israeli daily newspaper, quoted the aides as
saying Shamir may cancel his mid-November trip to Washington if the
divisions persist. One unidentified source in Shamir's office was
quoted as saying, ``We fear that differences of opinion between the
prime minister and President Bush, if expressed face-to-face, will
cause an explosion.''
   However, Shamir said later on Israel army radio, ``I can only
state there are some disagreements, they are not very sharp and I'm
convinced we can certainly overcome them.''
   Speaking on Israel Television, Shamir denied the visit was in
doubt. ``We're not running away from our views and the need to
express them,'' he said. The exact dates of the trip have not been
announced.
   In another development, a senior aide to Finance Minister Shimon
Peres said that leader's planned visit to the Soviet Union was in
doubt. He indicated Kremlin officials have not responded to
requests for top-level meetings.
   In more unrest in the occupied territories Monday, Israeli
troops shot and killed Mohammed Abu Libde, 19, and wounded at least
six other people, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed the youth was killed during a military
operation at the West Bank refugee camp of Tulkarem.
   The death brought to 601 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli gunfire in the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli
occupation. Forty Israelis have been killed in the violence.
   Shamir adviser Avi Pazner confirmed in a telephone interview
that U.S. and Israeli officials were divided over how to carry out
Israel's proposal for elections in the occupied lands.
   ``We hope this will all be straightened out before the meeting
with Bush,'' Pazner said.
   Israel's plan calls for elections in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to choose Palestinian representatives for negotiations on
limited self-rule for the territories. The status of the occupied
lands would be decided later.
   The U.S.-Israeli differences stem from U.S. efforts to arrange
an initial meeting with Palestinians to revive the stalled plan.
   Shamir told the television the key points in dispute were
Israel's insistance that no members of the Palestine Liberation
Organizations sit on a Palestinian delegation to talks and that
only matters related to elections be discussed.
   On Monday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-of-center
Labor Party opened a fresh Israeli debate about the plan of
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, saying Israel was
considering it despite Shamir's objections.
   Speaking to high school students in suburban Tel Aviv, he said
Baker's proposals ``have not been rejected or accepted'' and should
be considered by the Cabinet.
   Shamir also came under fire Monday from the other side of the
political spectrum. Ariel Sharon, Shamir's rival in the hard-line
Likud bloc, said Shamir had told Americans one thing and Israelis
something different.
   ``This has been a dangerous road from the beginning,'' he said.
``There's no place for a conflict with the United States, and I
think there would have been no conflict if we spoke clearly.''
   The Peres aide, meanwhile, said Peres would make a final
decision in mid-November about whether to make his trip to Moscow.
The aide, Nimrod Novick, returned to Israel this week after trying
to work out details of the trip, which has not yet been scheduled.
   Peres has been invited to Moscow by the non-governmental Soviet
Peace Committee. However, the minister, who also serves as Labor
Party leader, is reportedly seeking a meeting with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev or Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Peres is currently in a hospital recovering from a urinary
infection.

<HEAD>Sex Game `Foreplay' Found in Ambulance Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sex-oriented game is in the computer that
monitors city ambulances, but an official on Monday dismissed
speculation that the game could distract dispatchers or lead to
computer problems.
   John Petrofsky, a computer consultant for the Emergency Medical
Services, said in Monday's editions of the New York Post that the
game ``Foreplay'' had been in the EMS system since September 1988.
   The program could slow the computer or stop it for 30 minutes,
Petrofsky said. It also might carry a computer ``virus'' that could
shut down the computer for two days, he said.
   EMS spokeswoman Lynn Schulman said the inspector general of the
Health and Hospitals Corp. had confirmed that the game was in the
system, but she said it had no effect on response time, which has
been reduced in recent months.
   It was not clear who entered the game into the system, or
whether dispatchers or those who receive emergency calls even had
access to it, she said. Investigators were searching the master
computer Monday, she said.
   ``As soon as we find anything inappropriate, like this game or
anything else, it will be taken out of the computer,'' she said.
``When we find who's responsible, they'll be dealt with
appropriately.''
   Petrofsky told the Post at least 35 employees could gain access
to the game at one time, but the story did not say which employees.
   ``To make the implication that (dispatchers and call receivers)
don't do their work is ludicrous and unfair to them,'' Schulman
said.
   ``These are very hard-working and dedicated individuals who are
very insulted that someone would make allegations that they were
playing games when they're supposed to be dispatching ambulances.''
   The game involves the seduction of a woman, with players
choosing various tactics to gain ``arousal points,'' the Post said.
The wrong move can get a player kicked out of the woman's apartment.
   Petrofsky told the Post he was fired last week after warning
superiors over the past eight months of threats posed by the game.
   Schulman declined to comment on his dismissal, except to say
there were many protections for such whistle-blowers and that EMS
``encourages him to use the number of appeal procedures available.''
   Petrofsky said he told his boss, Norman Hunter, about the game
on March 23, but Hunter told the Post he did not remember
discussing such a game. Hunter said he did not know why Petrofsky
was fired, and said to ask EMS deputy executive director Joanne
Margusee, who is on vacation.
   Petrofsky produced records that showed the game was entered into
the system on Sept. 19, 1988, and revised twice since then.

   RADAR STATION
   The power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against
mistakes. It's important not to hide them, to admit them and
correct them.
   In this respect, the Krasnoyarsk radar installation issue is
very significant. It took us four years to get to the bottom of it.
   We were charged with violation of the ABM treaty because of the
station. It took the government quite a while to learn all the
truth of the project. Finally, we saw it clearly: The station had
been built on the wrong site, not where it should have been.
   All these years, we have been working hard to keep up the ABM
treaty as a foundation for strategic stability. We have been
looking for options and having very complicated debates on the
interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements'
contents.
   And all the while, there stood the station, the size of an
Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of
the ABM treaty.
   At last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle
the station. This has brought some discontent in the country, as if
we were foregoing our own interests.
   In fact, we are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the
conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons, and we're gaining
the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of
American installations in Greenland and England which were
modernized, we understand, in violation of the treaty.

   Jim Bakker should repay up to $100
million donated by his PTL followers as well as go to jail for his
fraud and conspiracy conviction, prosecutors said Monday.
   ``Fraud in the name of a religious organization is conduct which
must be deterred and punished,'' the prosecutors said in a
sentencing recommendation.
   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging he defrauded
followers of his television ministry, selling lodging guarantees at
his Christian retreat when he knew rooms weren't available at his
inns. Followers sent more than $158 million for the lodging rights.
   The jury found that Bakker used more than $3.7 million to buy
luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.
   Bakker will be sentenced Tuesday at a hearing in U.S. District
Court that is scheduled to start at 2 p.m. He faces 120 years in
prison and a fine of more than $5.2 million.
   Prosecutors filed the memorandum a day earlier with U.S.
District Court Judge Robert Potter, whose penchant for stiff
penalties has earned him the nickname ``Maximum Bob.''
   ``It appears unlikely the lifetime partners will recoup their
losses through the bankruptcy proceeding,'' the memo said. ``As a
result the government urges that restitution be ordered by the
court.''
   A letter from lawyers representing the partners was attached to
the memo and said unsettled claims made on behalf of various
partners would total between $90 million and $100 million.
   In the sentencing memo, Justice Department fraud specialist
Deborah Smith and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Potter
that Bakker be fined the maximum amount, which totals $5.23
million, if restitution wasn't ordered.
   Bakker couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney, Harold
Bender, said the defrocked Assemblies of God minister was driving
from his Orlando, Fla., home to Charlotte.
   Bender attached character references from Bakker supporters to
his three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to
consider alternatives to prison.
   Bender asked the court to ``consider reasonable alternatives and
allow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion and
mercy.''
   The lawyer also said former PTL executive vice president Richard
Dortch, who was indicted with Bakker, received an eight year prison
sentence after pleading guilty.
   ``It would appear the only difference between this defendant and
the co-defendant was that this defendant chose to exercise his
constitutional right of trial by jury,'' Bender said.
   Bender had no comment on the government's sentencing
recommendation and said he planned to meet Monday night with Bakker.

   Two weeks ago, Miss Ireland underwent surgery three times in one

go on and I can go on. I feel very happy today and quite strong

   The Garden of Hope is sponsored by the Preventive Medicine

early detection institute.
   ``If it weren't for people like that, I wouldn't be here today

   Lord Toby Aldington required hospital treatment
Monday after he stumbled in a courtroom during a High Court libel
trial over allegations that he is a war criminal.
   The 75-year-old peer fell as he stepped down from a bench beside
his lawyer's desk and suffered a graze on the head and a bloody
nose.
   Aldington, the former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party,
is claiming libel damages over allegations in a pamphlet published
by historian Count Nikolai Tolstoy and Nigel Watts, a property
developer.
   The pamphlet claimed Aldington, an army chief of staff at the
end of World War II, arranged the repatriation in 1945 of 70,000
Cossacks and Yugoslavs to the Communists knowing they would be
massacred on their return.
   Many of the 70,000 had fought on the German side during the war.
They had fallen into Allied hands on the collapse of Germany at the
end of the war.
   Their return was demanded by the late Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin.
   Historians say many people repatriated after the war were shot
by the Communists.
   Aldington, the ex-chairman of the Sun Alliance Insurance Group,
has said he is the victim of harassment by Watts. He claims Watts
was angered by the company's failure to provide payments after the
death of his brother-in-law.
   Aldington needed no stitches after he was taken to the hospital
Monday, and X-rays showed no damage, Judge Michael Davies said. He
said Aldington was expected to be back in court Tuesday.
   The trial was in its third week.

   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
suggested Monday that Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas are rigging
the campaign for the Feb. 25 general elections.
   During debate in the General Assembly, Pickering said the
Sandinista government views democratic reform as ``little more than
another obstacle to be overcome in continuing to violate
international, hemispheric and regional commitments.''
   His allegations disputed a report by U.N. election monitors sent
to Nicaragua.
   The report, released last week, said the monitors found
Nicaragua's Supreme Election Council gave ``no undue benefits'' to
the Sandinistas and ``there is appreciable concern on the part of
the members of the council to ensure the broadest possible
participation by political groups and citizens.'' The U.N.
monitoring mission is led by former U.S. Attorney General Elliott
Richardson.
   Pickering told the assembly, ``We remain concerned over actions
by the Nicaraguan government to limit the access by the Nicaraguan
opposition parties to the media and to limit the opposition's
ability to campaign to a broad public.''
   He said Washington also is ``concerned by the reported presence
of armed soldiers at Nicaraguan voter registration centers.''
   The U.N. report noted opposition parties receive free time on
Nicaragua's channel 2, which reaches only the Pacific coast and
interior, while the Sandinistas have sole use of the more powerful
channel 6. But the report added ``the use of radio and television
for political propaganda began too recently for any in-depth
discussion of the question to be possible at this stage.'' The
report covered the period from July 5 to Sept. 30.
   Voter registration for the Feb. 25 elections was held on the
first four Sundays in October. The Supreme Electoral Council said
that on the first three Sundays 1,336,342 citizens had registered
out of an estimated 1,970,486 eligible voters.
   The General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution praising
progress toward peaceful resolutions of the conflicts in Central
America following agreements by five Central American presidents at
a conference in August.
   Pickering, however, accused Cuba and Nicaragua of undermining
the peace process by shipping weapons to the leftist rebels
fighting the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador.
   ``There is no doubt that Cuba and Nicaragua regularly,
systematically and continually aid, arm and train'' the Salvadoran
guerrillas, he said.
   In another development, Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano
Caldera said his government might bar Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, from returning to the country after a Dec. 5 deadline.
   The August agreement, known as the Tela Accord, involves among
other issues the disarming and disbanding of the Contras by Dec. 5.
Many of the Contras are in bases across the border in Honduras.
   Serrano Caldera, speaking with reporters outside the General
Assembly, said, ``Non-compliance with the agreement would mean
Nicaragua could adopt the position that it is not bound by the
agreement to receive the Contras.''
   ``I would emphasize that the Tela Accord must be totally
complied with,'' he said.
   The United States has said the Tela Accord requires only the
voluntary disbanding of the estimated 11,000 Contras in Honduras
and many of the rebels do not want to return to their homeland
until democratic elections have been held.
   Free and democratic elections in Nicarauga are a provision of
the Tela Accord.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Henry A. Grunwald, who
oversaw U.S. relations with Austria during a period of unease over
President Kurt Waldheim's role in World War II, is resigning for
personal reasons, U.S. officials said Monday.
   Grunwald, 67, has been ambassador since January 1988. His
resignation will be effective Jan. 1, a U.S. Embassy representative
said without elaborating on the reasons.
   Grunwald replaced Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics company heir who
was defeated in a New York City mayoral Republican primary in
September.
   During Grunwald's tenure, U.S.-Austrian relations reached a low
point over reports that accused Waldheim of complicity in Nazi war
crimes. In April 1987, the U.S. Justice Department placed Waldheim
on a list of undesirable aliens.
   Born in Vienna, Grunwald, a Jew, was forced to flee Austria as a
child after Adolf Hitler took over the country and merged it with
Germany in 1938. Most Jews who remained were sent to death camps.
   In New York, Grunwald worked his way from copy boy at Time
magazine to foreign editor and then editor-in-chief. He retired
from that post in 1987.
   He was expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday in Vienna.

   Boarding one of the first
ferryboats pressed into emergency service Monday to carry commuters
across San Francisco Bay, I expected a romantic ride through the
fog. Reality brought nausea.
   The worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of
thousands of residents in Alameda and Contra Costa counties east of
San Francisco began the trek to work.
   This 127-foot ocean vessel, one of 14 being run on routes unused
by ferries for decades, met blustery winds, giant swells that
crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching
from side to side. The song of the journey should be, ``I Left My
Stomach on San Francisco Bay.''
   The 55-minute voyage, made necessary because of the collapse of
a 50-foot section of the vital San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
during last Tuesday's quake, was twice what was expected.
   The triple-deck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes
late because of weather worries and a low passenger count. The
captain announced some boats might be turned back. A big groan.
   I arrived dockside before dawn, naively thinking I could relive
idyllic bay crossings created by writers like Jack London and in
such classic movies as Humphrey Bogart's ``Dark Passage.''
   I wasn't alone.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it; it can only get better, this can't get much worse,''
said an ashen-faced John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda, who came onto
the deck to alleviate sea sickness.
   I moved up to the bow, where a giant swell drenched me. Since I
was downwind, I figured it would be best to remain there in case I
lost my breakfast.
   The ferry, with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338, was
supposed to dock at the Ferry Building in San Francisco. But waves
craching there forced the boats to divert to Fisherman's Wharf.
   Altogether my commute _ from hearth to work station _ took 3{
hours. I used to do it in 45 minutes. At the wharf, I tried to
catch a cable car into downtown, only to find it shut down. I
walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city
bus to work.
   Roughing it across the bay didn't dampen everybody's spirits.
   ``Considering everything, my commute has really gone smooth,''
said Maggie Faulkner, 46, of Oakland.
   Karen Meyer, 42, of Oakland, used to work on Long Island, N.Y.,
ferries, and was unflappable.
   ``Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion,'' she
said. ``That includes all the bosses.''
   Elena Pierini 44, of Oakland, recalled taking ferries to
Berkeley as a child. She relived those memories Monday morning.
   ``This makes up for all the bad things that came out of the
earthquake,'' said the San Francisco General Hospital research
nurse.
   The weather was trying for Dick Simpson, vice president of
marketing for Crowley Maritime, which operated the ferries. He rode
the Catalina Empress, which normally operates between Long Beach
and Catalina Island in Southern California.
   ``Mother nature is testing our mental state; normally this bay
is as smooth as glass at this time,'' said Simpson. About 3,000
people used the ferries Monday morning, Crowley said.
   Ferryboat service to the East bay, which began in 1863, grew to
include hundreds of boats at its height in the early 1930s. It was
discontinued shortly after the Bay bridge opened in 1937.

   ``Look Who's Talking'' claimed the No. 1 box
office spot for the second weekend in a row, proving John
Travolta's comeback was not short-lived, according to figures
released Monday.
   Grossing $14.1 million, the comedy starring Travolta, Kirstie
Alley and Bruce Willis as the voice of a baby from conception to
infancy finished almost $10 million ahead of second-place ``Next of
Kin.''
   ``Next of Kin,'' featuring Patrick Swayze and Liam Neeson
pursuing their brother's killer, collected $4.8 million in ticket
sales, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Overall weekend business for the Top 10 was $38.5 million, up
63.5 percent from a year ago, said Entertainment Data Inc., which
also tracks box-office business.
   ``Look Who's Talking,'' playing on 339 more screens than a week
ago, was up 17 percent from its debut weekend, Entertainment Data
reported.
   In third place with $3 million was ``Sea of Love,'' the romantic
thriller starring Al Pacino as a policeman whose murder suspect,
played by Ellen Barkin, is also his lover.
   ``Black Rain,'' the international adventure movie starring
Michael Douglas, finished fourth with $2.84 million. In fifth place
with receipts of $2.83 million was ``Gross Anatomy,'' a new
medical-school comedy featuring Matthew Modine and Daphne Zuniga.
   The dead-teenager sequel ``Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael
Myers'' landed in sixth with a gate of $2.79 million, down a sharp
45 percent from its opening weekend. In seventh was ``The Fabulous
Baker Boys,'' with Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer, which took
$2.78 million.
   Falling four notches to eighth was Tom Selleck's prison movie,
``An Innocent Man,'' grossing $2.3 million. In ninth was the
bittersweet family comedy ``Parenthood,'' with $1.51 million.
   In last place among the Top 10 was the new ``Fat Man and Little
Boy,'' starring Paul Newman in the story of the creation of the
atomic bomb. The movie failed to explode, collecting only $1.48
million for a terrible opening per-screen average of $1,752.
   Although Woody Allen's ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' didn't make
the leader board, it was up 1.5 percent from its opening weekend on
positive word of mouth.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $14.1 million, 1,547
screens, $9,145 per screen, $30.1 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Next of Kin,'' Warner Bros., $4.8 million, 1,358 screens,
$3,539 per screen, $4.8 million, one week.
   3. ``Sea of Love,'' Universal, $3 million, 1,419 screens, $2,080
per screen, $46.4 million, six weeks.
   4. ``Black Rain,'' Paramount, $2.84 million, 1,615 screens,

<TEXT>
   Lebanese Christians were split Monday
over Gen. Michel Aoun's rejection of a plan to end the civil war
and Aoun put his men on alert in case of renewed fighting with
Syrian troops and their Moslem allies.
   Amal and Hezbollah, the two main militias of the 1.2 million
Shiite Moslems, and Druse leader Walid Jumblatt also rejected the
accord. It was approved Sunday by Lebanese Christian and Moslem
legislators after three weeks of negotiations in Taif, Saudi
Arabia. Jumblatt is Syria's main Lebanese ally.
   An aide to Aoun said the general put Christian army units, which
number about 20,000 men, on alert to ``cope with all
eventualities.''
   Leave was canceled and troops were ordered to stay in barracks,
he said, speaking privately, but added: ``We're not going to war.
It's a defensive measure.''
   Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded, nearly all
of them civilians, before a truce last month in an artillery war
that began March 8 between Aoun's forces and a Moslem alliance led
by Syrian troops.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, a year after the sectarian
civil war began. Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation army and has
declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said the United States ``warmly welcomes'' the peace plan, which
she said provided ``a unique chance'' to end a war that has killed
at least 150,000 Lebanese.
   ``The challenge now is for all concerned parties to seize this
extraordinary opportunity to consolidate and implement what has
been achieved,'' she said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
``congratulates the Lebanese deputies for their courage and
statesmanship, which have yielded an extraordinary opportunity to
bring lasting peace in Lebanon.''
   Aoun announced his rejection Sunday night and criticized George
Saadeh, a legislator who leads the Lebanese Front, a coalition of
right-wing Christian political parties.
   The Kuwaiti daily Al-Watan on Monday quoted Aoun as saying: ``I
say to George Saadeh, don't sign and return home. If he signs, his
signature commits him personally. Let him come and impose by force
what he agreed to if he can overpower me and dismiss me.''
   The Lebanese legislators went Monday from Taif to the Saudi city
of Jiddah for a closing session scheduled for Tuesday.
   In Jiddah, 24 Christian legislators led by Saadeh met to discuss
Aoun's rejection and then issued a statement saying, ``It's a crime
to let this opportunity slip away, an opportunity which might not
be repeated.
   ``It was a choice between a continuation of the destructive war
and peace. ... It was a wise choice if compared with negative
rejections.''
   Pro-Iranian Hezbollah issued a statement declaring: ``Any
solution from Taif does not concern us. ... The only system that
safeguards justice and equality is Islam.''
   Jumblatt, in his rejection, called the accord ``silly and
sectarian.'' He said it ``obstructs the construction of a new,
democratic and modern Lebanon.''
   About 5,000 Aoun supporters demonstrated Monday outside his
residence _ the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in Baabda, a
Christian suburb.
   ``Withdrawing confidence from those who have gone to another ...
land which is not ours is a must,'' Aoun told the crowd.
   The deputies who met in Taif ``must understand that their role
is over and that now it is your turn, yours alone,'' he said.
   Aoun declared: ``What happened in Taif is a mistake that should
be corrected! This is the day of option! You have to choose between
free existence or capitulation and humiliation!''
   Sources close to Aoun, who heads a Christian military cabinet in
Lebanon's splintered government, said he feels he has the
constitutional power to disband Parliament and declare martial law.
   Moslems support the cabinet of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
a Sunni Moslem.
   Hoss, who supported the Taif peace plan, said: ``The only
alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide. No one has the
right to take a decision to commit suicide on behalf of the people
and the nation. This could be the last chance to lead the Lebanese
out of the sea of fury to the shore of peace.''
   Aoun's main objection to the peace accord is its lack of a
timetable for Syrian withdrawal. It provides for the Syrians, who
control more than 70 percent of Lebanese territory, to move into
the eastern Bekaa Valley in a two-year phased pullback from Beirut
and its environs.
   Sixty-three legislators began meeting in Taif on Sept. 30,
choosing a site outside Lebanon to avoid pressure from the various
Lebanese factions.
   Fifty-nine deputies voted for the draft Sunday, two abstained,
one was opposed and one was missing because of illness.
   Under the plan, Parliament would be expanded from 99 seats to
108, equally divided between Moslems and Christians.
   Christians have controlled the government, judiciary and army
since independence from France in 1943, when they were the
majority. Moslems have become the majority since and demand more
power.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's most senior supreme court
justice pleaded guilty to drunken driving charges Monday, and
promised not to participate in any drunken driving decisions for at
least a year.
   ``My shame and embarassment are beyond my ability to express,''
Supreme Court Justice Robert Clifford, 64, of Chester said in a
statement following his plea and sentencing in a courtroom a block
from his own chambers.
   Superior Court Judge Samuel Lenox suspended Clifford's license
for a year after the justice pleaded guilty to driving while
intoxicated and refusing to submit to a Breathalyzer test.
   Earlier Monday, Clifford followed court custom and excused
himself from oral arguments in a case questioning the legality of
the Breathalyzer test, which police use to determine the amount of
alcohol in the blood.
   Clifford, who has served on New Jersey's seven-member high court
longer than any other justice, was arrested in Princeton early Oct.
12 after an officer saw him crossing the highway center line and
driving 46 mph in a 35-mph zone. Clifford, who was returning from a
dinner, refused to take the test.
   Lenox also fined Clifford $500 plus court costs, and ordered him
to pay a $100 surcharge to a rehabilitation fund for alcoholics.
Clifford will also have to pay a $3,000 auto insurance surcharge
over the next three years.
   Clifford, who is known for his wit and penetrating questions
during oral arguments before the high court, displayed little
emotion at his own hearing.
   Asked by Lenox whether he had driven under the influence and
refused to take the Breathalyzer test, Clifford replied, ``Yes,
sir.''
   In his statement, the justice said he would not participate in
any drunken driving case for at least the year of his license
suspension.
   ``I have concluded that the best way to prevent any repetition
of drinking and driving is to avoid drinking,'' Clifford said.
``That is my intention, and I will not hesitate to draw on whatever
support is necessary to help me fulfill it.''
   Clifford and his attorney, Bernard Conway, refused to make any
further comments.
   The office later issued a statement saying Clifford's case would
be referred to the court's Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct,
which could recommend disciplinary measures.
   Clifford said his conduct let down former Govs. William Cahill,
who appointed him to the high court in 1973, and Brendan Byrne, who
reappointed him in 1980.
   ``Most importantly, I did not fulfill the legitimate
expectations of the people of New Jersey, who are entitled to
nothing short of irreproachable conduct from members of the
judiciary,'' he said. ``To all of them I apologize.''

   An earthquake shook the Alban Hills outside Rome on
Monday evening, frightening citizens but causing no damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   The quake occurred at about 10.20 p.m. and measured six to seven
on the Mercalli Scale, roughly equivalent to 3.8 on the Richter
Scale, the National Geophysics Institute reported.
   The epicenter was near Ariccia, a town about 12 miles southeast
of Rome in the Alban Hills.
   A quake of similar magnitude jolted the same area last Friday
but caused no damage.
   The Civil Protection Ministry reported no damage or casualties
but police said scores of residents fled into the streets in panic
and some families decided to spend the night in their cars.
   The quake was also felt throughout this capital. Residents said
they felt floors shaking for about 10 seconds.

   A House committee on Monday approved a $2.85
billion aid package for the San Francisco earthquake, more than the
White House supported but $1 billion less than the amount pushed by
the California congressional delegation.
   The plan was approved by voice vote in the House Appropriations
Committee after the panel rejected, 26-7, the state delegation's
request for $3.8 billion. Committee chairman Jamie L. Whitten,
D-Miss., said more money could come later but he didn't want to
send too much, too soon with too few controls.
   ``My whole pitch is to do something now, straighten it out
later, and don't waste any money in the meantime,'' Whitten said.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., the senior Republican on the
committee, said the Bush administration could accept Whitten's
proposal. The White House had proposed earmarking less than $2.5
billion, with nearly $1 billion of that coming from existing
federal accounts.
   Full House action was expected on Tuesday, as the aid was
attached to a stopgap spending bill which must be sent to the
President by Wednesday to avert a government shutdown on Thursday.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who led his state's effort in the
committee, said the $2.85 billion ``does not, of course, meet all
our needs.'' He said he was also concerned that the committee
refused to waive requirements for local matching of some of the
federal highway aid.
   The committee votes came during a somewhat testy session, during
which lawmakers from other states questioned why California's aid
package should be so big.
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., proposed and then withdrew an
amendment which would have allocated $5 billion for his home state
to compensate for the hurricane damage it has suffered in
hurricanes since the turn of the century.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, said he was ``troubled by the lack of
accountability'' in the California plan. Congress should ``look at
it a lot more carefully with hearings,'' he suggested.
   ``We are the Golden State and I think there is a certain amount
of jealousy,'' Fazio said afterward.
   The committee approved $1.1 billion for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's efforts to repair the devastation and $1
billion for the Federal Highway Administration's emergency fund.
Most of the fatalities, and the worst damage from the quake, was
related to highway structures.
   In addition, $500 million would be given to the Small Business
Administration for emergency loans, and $250 million for President
Bush to spend at his discretion on other operations.
   The California delegation, Congress' largest at 47 members, had
wanted $1 billion for highway repair, $1.1 billion for FEMA, $1.2
billion for SBA disaster loans and $100 million for loans to
low-income people. The president would have been given a $400
million discretionary fund.
   The White House was proposing a more modest $2.5 billion
package, of which only $1.5 billion would be spending beyond what's
already available in the federal budget.
   The White House proposed no new SBA spending authority and no
discretionary fund for the president. If proposed only $600 million
for highway repair, $500 million in additional spending, with
California using local money and insurance, when appropriate, to
pay for part of the roadway costs instead of having the federal
government covering virtually the entire tab.
   The Californians said their estimates of the damage were now in
excess of $7 billion. Fazio told the committee that experts have
led him to believe it can grow to more than $10 billion.
   ``The state will have to come up with huge sums of money, but
the federal government will have to help,'' he said. ``We're not
going to ask anybody to gild any lilies.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., told a Senate hearing that his
estimate of the total cost was over $7 billion, although he didn't
expect the federal government to pay that much.
   ``The human suffering and anguish can never be compensated, but
we can attempt to deal to the extent possible with the physical and
economic losses,'' said Cranston, the Senate Majority whip.
   Congressional discussion barely touched on how to pay for aid to
California. Although California officials have been talking about
raising state taxes, both the White House and Congress were loath
to make such a suggestion.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., tried unsuccessfully in the committee
to remove a provision in the bill waiving the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   With that provision in the bill, the cost will be added to the
federal deficit.
   ``I don't like that approach but ultimately our first priority
is to help the victims of this kind of disaster,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Budget Committee whose
district south of San Francisco suffered heavy damage.
   One congressional budget expert said there was no way to rein in
the federal cost, because politicians don't want to be seen as
Scrooges. Another said members of Congress don't want to be seen as
``the skunk at the picnic.'' Both spoke on condition that their
names not be used.

   Charles Burns had just moved into an
apartment Friday near the site of the Cypress offramp of the Nimitz
Freeway, which had collapsed only days earlier in a massive
earthquake.
   On Monday, Burns was temporarily homeless because of a decision
to remove a portion of unstable freeway near his apartment.
   Burns and more than 100 residents of a West Oakland public
housing project were told to leave their homes Sunday afternoon
after engineers concluded the freeway section near four of the
project's buildings might collapse.
   Residents were told to leave their homes immediately _ and leave
most belongings behind.
   ``We were all scared,'' Burns said. ``We were all wondering,
`What's going on now?' I thought there'd been another earthquake.''
   While some residents were able to find their own temporary
shelter, Burns took his Bible and some other books to the Lowell
Middle School, where he joined about 160 other people, some of whom
had been there since last week.
   They sat on cots in the school gymnasium, eating food provided
by local agencies and trying to figure out relief forms.
   ``I'll be glad when it's all straightened out,'' Burns said.
``One minute you're home and the next minute you're out and you
don't know why. There's confusion and chaos here.''
   Engineers estimate it may take 48 hours to take down the section
of freeway which imperiled the neighborhood, and it may be 24 hours
more before the residents can return.
   ``We are very aware of the problems people are going through,''
said Oakland police Lt. Kris Wraa. ``But the safety of the citizens
overpowered the need to let them get their belongings.''
   The west end of the housing project is within 20 feet of the
endangered freeway and if it had fallen on its own, ``a tremendous
amount of damage could be done and people could be hurt,'' said
CalTrans representative Kyle Nelson.
   What caused the most confusion was the short notice given, with
residents first being told they had to begin leaving immediately at
3:30 p.m. Sunday. Rumors bounced from house to house, ranging from
another earthquake to the possibility of a gas leak.

   A bomb in a briefcase-size container
exploded in a ball of fire at a high school principal's office as
explosives experts were trying to disarm it, fire officials said.
   The blast shortly before 1 p.m. caused extensive smoke damage at
Western Hills High School and ignited paperwork on Principal Bill
Roper's desk, but no one on the Fort Worth Fire Department bomb
squad was injured, officials said.
   ``We are real lucky,'' fire Lt. F.W. Tacker said after the
explosion in this suburb just southwest of Fort Worth.
   The container, which was described as a small attache case or a
cassette tape recorder, was found next to a drinking fountain by a
student, said Fire Department spokesman Butch Hall.
   The student opened the case, found wires and a battery inside,
and turned it over to school administrators. The case was taken to
Roper's office, and the school was evacuated.
   After the blast, the school's 1,800 students were sent home.
   ``There was smoke damage to his office and throughout the
building,'' Tacker said. ``The bomb created a ball of flame. It
destroyed its case, burned an indentation into the desk and set the
papers on top on fire.''
   Authorities were trying to determine the bomb's origin and
composition, Tacker said.
   An FBI agent went to the school to determine whether the case
fell under federal jurisdiction, said FBI agent Mike Santimauro in
Dallas. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firerarms also
was looking into the case.

   The construction of the Xingo dam, a
massive public works project of the outgoing administration of
President Jose Sarney, is being halted because of a cash shortage,
company officials announced Monday.
   A three-company consortium in charge of building the dam said
the federal government was $138 million behind in payments to the
project.
   As a result, the consortium must halt construction within 24
hours and lay off 2,050 workers, officials said.
   ``We've gone as far as we could, but we're convinced that we're
never going to see this money, '' said consortium superintendent
Ruiter Neto Campos at a Monday press conference in the northeastern
city of Recife.
   However, Campos said the group will resume work if the
government pays its debt.
   The dam was being built on the Sao Francisco River in
northeastern Bahia state.
   A $110 billion foreign debt coupled with growing internal debt
has drained federal coffers and stalled numerous public works.
   The 5,000-megawatt Xingo dam, projected to cost $2.5 billion, is
considered essential to supplying northeastern Brazil with
electricity by 1994. The dam is about 20 percent complete.

   Hungary declared itself a democracy
Monday, 33 years after Soviet troops crushed an anti-Stalinist
uprising, and chants of ``Russians go home!'' and ``Communism no
more!'' rose from a crowd of 100,000.
   Hungarian flags of red, white and green waved over the throng,
which overflowed the Parliament square. People cheered wildly in
the torch-lit plaza when participants in the uprising invoked
memories of its leaders.
   ``It took 33 years for those behind the thick walls to hear the
cries'' for democracy, Jenoe Fonay, a prominent activist who was
earlier involved in the uprising, told the rally. He was referring
to the recent official change of heart about the nature of the
12-day revolt that began Oct. 23, 1956.
   The Soviet bloc's bloodiest uprising was called
counterrevolution until early this year, when the official
description was changed to a popular uprising in one of the
dramatic moves in Hungary's progress toward democracy.
   As many as 32,000 people were killed in 1956 and about 200,000
fled the country.
   Gyula Obersovszky, a writer and editor who was sentenced to
death but later pardoned, said: ``I am keeping my fingers crossed
for Gorbachev.'' The crowd called out ``Gorby! Gorby!''
   ``History has taught us that as long as Moscow is not free, we
cannot be free either,'' Obersovszky said.
   He expressed certainty that ``the suppression of the revolution
would not have taken place'' if Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet
leader who champions reform, and President Bush had led the
superpowers in 1956.
   A banner proclaiming ``Freedom, Independence'' was draped across
the main entrance of Parliament and floodlights bathed the
structure.
   Gyoergy Krasso, a vocal opposition figure jailed for his part in
the uprising, drew one of the strongest ovations when he declared:
``We've had enough of Russian occupation!''
   Without mentioning names, he appealed to East European allies
who oppose reforms to ``help us and not make it more difficult.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said: ``Declaring itself an independent republic on the 33rd
anniversary of the popular uprising seems particularly appropriate.
We congratulate the Republic of Hungary and its people.''
   Hungarian national TV broadcast the entire rally, its cameras
panning frequently from the cheering crowd to the balcony with its
large photograph of Imre Nagy, who led the 1956 revolt and was
executed. Nagy's body was exhumed and reburied with honor in June.
   Some speakers recited patriotic poems, including one that began:
``The streets of Budapest are running with blood.''
   The evening rally followed a proclamation by acting President
Matyas Szueroes formally declaring Hungary a democracy after 41
years of communist rule.
   Szueroes declared the communist ``People's Republic of Hungary''
dead from the balcony of Parliament, to the applause of 100,000
people who had filled the square by midday.
   ``As of today, our nation's ... name is the Republic of
Hungary,'' he said, and church bells throughout the country pealed
at noon.
   State TV also broadcast the midday ceremony, the first
commemoration of the uprising ever conducted with official approval.
   Many people wore arm bands or hair ribbons in the national
colors, or waved large flags with jagged holes in the middle to
symbolize those of 1956 from which rebels cut the communist emblem.
   Tears flowed freely as the crowd sang the national anthem on the
anniversary, which Parliament declared a day of ``national
reconciliation.'' Teachers took their entire classes to the square.
Few police were visible, and none carried firearms or clubs.
   Hoots and whistles rose when Szueroes called for continued
cooperation with the Soviet Union. The crowd cheered and applauded
when he urged warmer ties with the United States.
   The applause was tumultuous applause when he said: ``The
Republic of Hungary has become a state governed by law, where the
values of ... democracy and democratic socialism are equally
valid.''
   Smaller rallies were held between the two mass events in the
square.
   Opposition leader Gyula Kiss said at one, ``Let us vow to finish
the revolution they had begun!'' and the crowd of about 10,000
replied ``We swear! We swear!''
   Two weeks ago, the ruling Communist Party dissolved itself in
favor of a successor Socialist Party favoring democratic ideals and
multiparty elections. The party issued a statement Friday rejecting
the Soviet invasion of 1956.

   Cigarette smokers need more than 1{ times as
much vitamin C a day as non-smokers, the National Research Council
said Monday in revising its nutrient intake recommendations for the
first time in nearly a decade.
   ``Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin,
leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' the NRC said in the
10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances.
   The new guidelines say that non-smokers need 60 milligrams of
vitamin C a day and that smokers need at least 100 milligrams. The
recommendation for pregnant women who do not smoke is 70 milligrams
a day.
   RDAs are defined as intake levels of essential nutrients that
are ``adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all
healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not
covered by the RDAs.
   The recommended allowances for nutrients are amounts intended to
be consumed as part of a normal diet; the NRC said they ``are
neither minimal requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of
intake.''
   RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The
Department of Agriculture, for instance, uses them to evaluate the
adequacy of the U.S. food supply, for establishing standards for
food-assistance programs and for determining the nutritional status
of the U.S. popoulation.
   Most average Americans come in contact most often with
nutritional information as it is listed on cereal boxes. Such
figures are derived from the RDAs.
   The new, 285-page volume leaves most previous recommendations
unchanged or modifies them only slightly. It does include some
important revisions.
   Instead of basing RDAs for adults on arbitrary heights and
weights, allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in
the population.
   Requirements for folate, which is found in liver, leafy
vegetables and some fruit, have been reduced from 400 micrograms
for both men and women to 240 micrograms for men aged 25 to 50 and
190 micrograms for women of the same ages.
   The RDA for vitamin B-12, an essential nutrient for maintaining
normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2.
   The new edition lists recommended dietary allowances for
protein, 11 vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides
known nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally
occurring substances of certain nutritional value.
   ``A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the
Food and Nutrition Board of the NRC, ``will probably be adequate in
all other nutrients.''
   The recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather goals
to be met over time.
   ``In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the NRC, ``it is
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a
single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the
nutrients.''

   An atmospheric phenomenon called a
``rolling wave'' may have been the cause of the crash of a Honduran
airliner that killed 131 people, sources close to the investigation
said Monday.
   They said such a wave, created by a strong wind blowing over
mountains, could have caused a severe downdraft that forced the
Boeing 727 jet 1,800 feet below its assigned altitude and into a
mountain as it approached Tegucigalpa's Toncontin airport Saturday.
   A flight attendant and passenger aboard the Honduran airline
TAN-SAHSA plane were quoted as saying there had been an explosion
aboard the craft. But the sources, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the investigation was focusing on an atmospheric
disturbance as being the cause of the crash.
   Investigators also were considering the possibility of loss of
power in an engine as a cause of the sudden descent, according to
the sources.
   They said reports of severe atmospheric turbulence before the
crash would support the theory of a ``rolling wave'' downdraft.
   Such a wave could be created by wind flowing south over the
Cerro de Hule that would follow the contour of the land until
running into other mountains, the sources said. The wind would then
be pushed up and over, creating a violent downdraft.
   The phenomenon is similar to wind-shear thunderstorms that have
caused crashes near airports in the United States, the sources said.
   Twelve of the people killed in Saturday's crash were U.S.
citizens. There were 15 survivors, including the pilot and co-pilot
and three American passengers.
   Investigators, including teams from Boeing and the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board, divided into groups to study evidence.
   Giomar Lizzeth Nunez, a 28-year-old flight attendant aboard the
Honduran jet, said, ``The pilot announced he was going to descend.
We were two minutes from the airport ... and I was in my seat with
the seatbelt fastened.
   ``There was an explosion. The emergency door came off toward the
inside of the plane, dragging with it a small storage bin where the
flight attendants keep our suitcases. Then there was a strong
impact.''
   Her account was carried by La Tribuna, a Tegucigalpa newspaper.
   Ramon Sanchez Borba, 48, a passenger, told reporters,
``Everything was calm. All of a sudden I saw fire ... and there was
an explosion.'' He is an an honorary Paraguayan consul in
Tegucigalpa.
   The plane's flight recorders were sent to Washington to be
studied, said Raul Bonilla, the airline's marketing manager.
   The plane crashed into a mountain about 20 miles south of
Tegucigalpa at 7:50 a.m. as it approached the Honduran capital
after a flight from San Jose, Costa Rica, via Managua, Nicaragua.
   Col. Marco Tulio Rivera of the Honduran Civil Aeronautics
Authority said the pilot, Raul Argueta, reported everything was
normal in his last communication with the control tower at 7:45 a.m.
   He said Argueta radioed the plane was seven miles from the
airport at 7,500 feet and on target for an approach to the airport.
   The pilot, flying on instruments into a 50-mph wind and cloud
cover, was supposed to descend to 6,700 feet at the five-mile mark,
which is 1,800-feet above the 4,900-foot Cerro de Hule, Rivera said.
   ``What happened in those few seconds is what we have to figure
out,'' he added. He said Argueta has not been interviewed because
of his injuries.
   Co-pilot Reiniero Canales said in an interview with radio
station HRN there was nothing unusual about the flight until
``suddenly we hit something. It was all so fast we didn't have time
to react.''
   People fearing relatives were among the victims continued to
gather at the morgue where specialists were trying to identify the
bodies. Morgue chief Dennis Castro said more than 20 bodies have
been identified.
   A Nicaraguan air force plane arrived carrying coffins to take
back the bodies of 45 Nicaraguan victims. One of the 67 Nicaraguans
aboard survived.
   Economy Minister Reginaldo Panting said TAN-SAHSA had rented the
plane for $180,000 a month about a year ago from Continental
Airlines. He said it was valued at $30 million.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the plane was more
than 20 years old, with 52,019 cycles _ each a takeoff and landing
_ through September and about 65,500 flight hours. He said both
figures were average for a plane of that age.
   Cole said the 727-200 with the most cycles had 66,000 through
June. The number of cycles can indicate the stress a plane's
fuselage has undergone.
   Boeing has said consistently its aircraft can remain in service
indefinitely if properly maintained.
   Maj. Alejandro Arguello, Nicaraguan director of civil
aeronautics, quoted air controllers as saying the roof of the plane
tore away before the crash, but survivors interviewed did not
mention that.
   A 19-year-old Aloha Airlines 737 that lost 18 feet of its upper
fuselage over Hawaii in April 1988 had 89,680 cycles, among the
highest of any 737 in service.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet on Monday
pardoned two banished union leaders who were scheduled to meet
later this week with Lech Walesa, founder of Poland's Solidarity
movement.,
   The pardons allow Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martinez to leave the
rural towns where they were forced to live in internal exile for
the past 404 days.
   Walesa, who is due to arrive here Thursday, was scheduled to
visit Bustos in Parral, 210 miles south of Santiago, and Martinez
in Chanaral, 595 miles north of the capital.
   Bustos and Martinez were sentenced last year to 541 days of
confinement within those cities for calling a general strike in
1987 to protest Pinochet's military government.
   Bustos is president and Martinez vice president of the United
Workers Central, Chile's largest labor federation.
   The federation had invited Walesa to Chile and arranged meetings
with Bustos and Martinez during the three-day visit. The pardons
mean the three men will be able to meet togther in Santiago or any
other city.
   Presidential press secretary Andres Saiz said Pinochet granted
the pardons in response to a request by Catholic bishop Orozimbo
Fuenzalida of San Bernardo.
   Walesa had issued statements in Poland calling on Pinochet to
free the union officials.
   Government supporters said Walesa's visit is designed to boost
support for Patricio Aylwin, the main opposition candidate for
president in the Dec. 14 election. Pinochet is not a candidate.
   Diego Olivares, acting president of the labor federation, said
the Walesa visit is intended to promote labor rights and has
nothing to do with party politics.
   Walesa also is scheduled to meet with members of the conference
of Roman Catholic Bishops and with officials of a church-sponsored
human rights organization that has accused the Pinochet regime of
human rights violations.

   Space shuttle Atlantis
streaked down through the atmosphere and glided safely home Monday
after a five-day mission that sent the long-delayed Galileo
spacecraft on a 2.4-billion-mile journey to Jupiter.
   Atlantis touched down at 9:32 a.m. in a light breeze, cutting
short its mission by two 90-minute orbits to get down before
predicted high winds came up on Rogers Dry Lake. Before the
landing, dense fog had shrouded the base.
   ``Atlantis, congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' said
capsule communicator Ken Cameron in Houston. ``You've extended the
shuttle's reach to the outer planets.''
   ``It's nice to be home,'' shuttle commander Donald E. Williams
replied.
   A relatively modest crowd estimated at about 20,000 was on hand
to watch Williams, pilot Michael J. McCulley and mission
specialists Shannon W. Lucid, Ellen S. Baker and Franklin R.
Chang-Diaz come home.
   ``The vehicle looks amazingly clean. We did not see, with a
quick inspection, any significant tile damage _ a little nick here
and a nick there,'' William Lenoir, an acting associate
administrator of NASA, said at a post-landing news conference.
   After thanking a crowd of several hundred cheering NASA workers,
the astronauts left Edwards shortly before 2 p.m. aboard two
Gulfstream jets bound for their home base in Houston.
   ``This is a great beginning for the study of Jupiter,''
Chang-Diaz said after Galileo project manager Richard Spehalski
teased the astronauts for nicknaming ``our lovely spacecraft `the
Critter.'''
   ``The Galileo critter is on its way and doing very well,''
Spehalski said.
   The crew and their spouses returned to Houston at about 6:30
p.m. CDT, and they were greeted by their children and nearly 300
friends and co-workers.
   ``Atlantis was a magnificent ship,'' Williams said. The
commander also thanked the workers at Mission Control who helped
the crew during their flight.
   ``We had a great time,'' said Mrs. Baker, a mission specialist
who made her first trip into space aboard Atlantis. ``I'm really
proud to be part of the Galileo mission.''
   After having most of the day off Tuesday, the astronauts will
return to the Johnson Space Center on Wednesday to begin a series
of briefings about their flight, officials said.
   The successful deployment of the nuclear-powered Galileo
accomplished the mission's main goal about 6{ hours after blastoff
Wednesday from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The $1.5 billion spacecraft was said to be operating
flawlessley, passing the million-mile mark at a speed of nearly
9,000 mph, relative to Earth, on a looping, 6-year trip to explore
Jupiter.
   Problems in the shuttle program, including the 1986 Challenger
explosion, helped delay the start of Galileo's trip by seven years.
While a shuttle sent the Magellan orbiter toward Venus in May and
will deploy the Ulysses spacecraft to orbit the sun's poles next
October, scientists plan to use unmanned rockets to launch
subsequent planetary spacecraft.
   ``We're obviously relieved the shuttle gave us a magnificent
ride,'' said Neal Ausman, Galileo mission director for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``But we're also pleased we're not going to
be depending on the space shuttle as the only way into space.''
   Several groups unsuccessfully sought to prevent the shuttle
launch for fear that an accident could release radioactive fuel
into the atmosphere over Florida. A federal judge refused to halt
the flight.
   The crew fired Atlantis' big braking rockets to drop out of
orbit, and the 97-ton winged spaceship made a fiery descent toward
California, crossing the coast at four times the speed of sound,
105,000 feet over Malibu.
   Automatic control systems put the hurtling orbiter through
speed-shedding maneuvers, rocking the Los Angeles area with the
shuttle's signature twin sonic booms. Then Williams lightly set
Atlantis on the clay runway where it rolled to a stop on the
black-dotted centerline.
   Reflecting jitters from last week's Bay Quake, the Santa Monica
Police Department got about a dozen calls around 9:30 a.m., said
Officer Kim Neal. Nervous callers thought the resonating boom as
Atlantis descended was an earthquake or gunshots.
   The shuttle passed through high winds aloft but surface winds
were reported at only about 4{ mph, with gusts at just under 6 mph
moments before touchdown.
   Fourteen minutes later, controllers told the crew they could
remove their bulky flight suits. An astronaut called back, ``Just
out of curiosity, Houston, what's the temperature outside?''
   At around 60 degrees, the astronauts were comfortable, exiting
the orbiter in their orange flight suits. They inspected the belly
of the shuttle, chatting, laughing and hugging each other before
leaving the dry lakebed for debriefing.
   Unofficial elapsed mission time was 4 days, 23 hours and 41
minutes.
   The astronauts had gone to bed early in anticipation of the
early landing and were awakened by a recording of Steve Miller's
``Fly Like an Eagle'' beamed up from Mission Control.
   ``Well I'm not sure we're flying like eagles, but it's been fun
so far,'' Williams remarked.
   If winds were too strong, the landing could have been postponed
until Tuesday or Wednesday, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said.
   The forecast predicted gusts up to 35 mph in the afternoon.
Safety rules forbid landings if headwinds reach 29 mph or
crosswinds reach 18 mph.
   The astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments,
including one that measured the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   Two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and
growing corn plants. The astronauts also photographed lightning
systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student
experiment.
   Time also was spent photographing various parts of the world
with the IMAX movie camera. The footage will be used for a
documentary film about Earth.
   Crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands have sometimes
greeted shuttle returns. Officials attributed the small turnout to
the fact that it was a weekday landing.
   There also were rain showers in Los Angeles, 80 miles south of
Edwards, and dense early morning fog around the base.

   Freeway survivor Buck Helm improved Monday
but crews searching the collapsed highway where he was rescued gave
up hope others would be found alive. The death toll from last
week's earthquake climbed by three to 62.
   Bay area commuters, after conquering heavy morning traffic and
rough seas on the first full workday since the quake, faced few
afternoon traffic tangles. In Congress, relief legislation worth
$2.85 billion moved toward a vote Tuesday.
   ``We're very certain nobody's up there alive. We've searched,
searched, researched, triple-searched,'' said Oakland police Lt.
Kris Wraa, referring to the crumpled 1\-mile stretch of Interstate
880 where huge slabs of concrete teetered in the rain.
   Asked if officials had given up hope of finding another
survivor, she said, ``That's fair wording.''
   With rescue efforts suspended, crews began dismantling a shaky
100-yard section, officials said.
   Kyle Nelson of the California Department of Transportation,
whose job is to make the structure was safe for rescuers, called it
extremely dangerous. ``Given the right conditions of rain and wind,
it could have collapsed,'' he said.
   Near the freeway, authorities Monday evacuated additional homes
after ordering 150 residents of a housing project to leave Sunday
because of fears that more of the highway could fall. Thousands
have been left homeless by the quake.
   ``We were all scared,'' said Charles Burns, who carried a Bible
and other books to a middle school where evacuees were being
sheltered.
   There was good news, however, for Helm. He was no longer in
pain, his kidney function continued to improve and his condition
was upgraded from critical to very serious, Dr. Floyd Huen said.
   ``We hope that as soon as tomorrow, he will be down to
serious,'' Huen said.
   The 57-year-old longshoreman, who spent four days trapped under
the freeway rubble in his Chevrolet Sprint before being rescued
Saturday, was awake and was given a writing tablet and pencil so he
could start responding to questions while on a respirator.
   His former wife, Lorrie Helm, has read him news accounts of his
ordeal and he seems to understand, she said.
   ``His love for us and our love for him is one of the major
things that kept him going,'' Mrs. Helm said at a news conference
with other family members.
   ``He's always been there when I needed him, and this is when he
needs us.''
   Since their parting, the two have remained good friends, she
said. ``We've been divorced for four years and he never gave up. I
would say that's a positive attitude.''
   Later, stopping at the collapsed freeway, Mrs. Helm exclaimed,
``Oh my God. I don't see how anyone could make it out alive,''
according to Oakland Police Sgt. Jack Huth.
   ``And then she reflected on it a minute and said, `Well, if
anyone could, Buck could.'''
   Commuters returned to the earthquake-ravaged transit system
Monday, many boarding extra trains or a flotilla of ferries because
the Bay Bridge from Oakland to San Francisco remained closed.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system carried twice the normal load
and ferry passengers had to stomach rough seas and whipping winds.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it,'' said John Trowbridge, a commuter who normally
would have driven across the Bay Bridge but instead rode a ferry
that lurched constantly, battling swells that washed across the tip
of the boat.
   ``It can only get better, this can't get much worse,'' he said.
   In clear weather during the evening rush hour, few traffic
bottlenecks were reported.
   Damage from Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake topped $7 billion,
surpassing Hurricane Hugo as the costliest natural disaster in U.S.
history, according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
   In San Francisco alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, Mayor Art Agnos told the city-county Board of Supervisors
Monday. He estimated damage in the city at $2.2 billion to $3.2
billion.
   Gov. George Deukmejian announced he would call a special
legislative session within two weeks to work out the state's
response to the devastation.
   Also Monday, the governor fired Ian Buckle, the earthquake
expert hired to probe the the I-880 collapse, saying his defense of
the state transportation department in an op-ed article jeopardized
the inquiry's impartiality.
   Two more deaths were reported in San Francisco, and in the beach
town of Bonny Doon, Calif., north of Santa Cruz, workers uncovered
the body of 41-year-old man, identified as Gary Phillip West,
buried by a landslide during the quake. His car had been found
Sunday.
   One San Francisco victim, an unidentified woman, was found in
fire rubble in the Marina district. The other, a 68-year-old woman
from Sweden, died of injuries sustained at a downtown hotel.
   So far, 38 bodies have been pulled from I-880. Dozens remained
missing and authorities said they are sure some remain entombed in
the freeway. Thousands were injured and homeless from the quake.
   At a Salvation Army warehouse filled to the rafters with donated
supplies, a dozen volunteers Monday prepared goods to be sent to
quake victims.
   Donors continued to bring plastic bags full of clothes, sleeping
bags and food to the warehouse, which held items ranging from
seltzer water to canned soup.
   ``People are just very generous,'' said Gordon Helms of the
Salvation Army. ``They're very concerned about the needs of other
people.''
   A House committee approved a $2.85 billion quake aid package,
and the full House is expected to act Tuesday. The package is more
than the White House supported, but more than $1 billion under the
request from the California congressional delegation.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the aid could
be extended without an increase in the gasoline tax or other new
federal taxes. Congressional sources said lawmakers were putting
off determining how to pay for the package.
   ``There is an urgent need for help for people now,'' Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., told the Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee on transporation and Resources.
   Yet for many in the Bay area, a scenic and diverse region of 6
million, life was actually quite normal throughout the past week.
Damage was confined to distinct areas of the major cities, although
destruction was widespread through Santa Cruz County towns.
   And Monday's commute, slow but not paralyzing, underscored how
well San Francisco has coped.
   Dr. Beverly Bradley, supervisor of health programs for the San
Francisco United School District, said she was in Chicago when the
quake hit and got mistaken first impressions that the entire city
crumpled.
   ``From watching TV, I got the impression the city was in
shambles. In truth, most of the city is functioning very well and
back to normal.
   ``I keep telling my relatives around the country the city is
fine except for some very specific areas that did suffer,'' she
said.
   The first phase of the Bay Bridge repair started when workers
sawed a 50-foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves
200 feet by crane Sunday to a barge on wind-whipped San Francisco
Bay.
   Without the Bay Bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists were forced
to seek other ways to work. Daily, 260,000 cars use the bridge, the
most crucial of the region's earthquake-disrupted roadways. Repairs
will take at least four weeks.
   About 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the
nine-county region. Authorities warned that 2 million of them could
be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course.
   Besides I-880 in Oakland, other freeways were also devastated.
The Embarcadero Freeway and the I-280 extension are closed in San
Francisco. Farther south, landslide-clogged Highway 17 is open only
to buses and emergency vehicles.

   Actor-comedian Chevy Chase was
released Monday from a hospital, where he was taken Sunday after
complaining of chest pains during a benefit tennis tournament in
nearby Boca Raton.
   Chase, 46, was taken to Delray Community Hospital after
apparently suffering heat exhaustion during a practice round with
tennis star and tournament sponsor Chris Evert.
   ``He felt a little sick to his stomach,'' said Richard Siemens,
developer of The Polo Club, where the tournament was being played.
   The former ``Saturday Night Live'' star, suffering from
dehydration and fatigue, underwent a full battery of tests and
spent the night under observation, said hospital spokeswoman
Elizabeth Koller.
   ``When he left the hospital he looked just like he does on TV,''
said Ms. Koller. ``He was in good spirits.''
   Chase was Ms. Evert's doubles partner Saturday in the tournament
to raise money for a drug abuse foundation.
   He won two Emmys for his work on ``Saturday Night Live,'' and
has appeared in movies, including ``Foul Play,'' ``Caddyshack'' and
``Fletch.''

   An 18-day-old infant awaiting adoption was
abducted from D.C. General Hospital Monday by a woman who posed as
a volunteer to the obstetrics ward, officials said.
   The kidnapping happened around lunchtime.
   ``At that hour of the day, mothers are coming in to feed their

Oct. 6.
   The woman authorities believe abducted the baby was described as
a black woman in her 20s, weighing between 230 pounds and 250
pounds with shoulder-length cornrows.
   ``We have no idea at this point'' who the woman is that took the
infant, Ms. Chisolm said.

<BYLINE>Former FBI Agent Granted Bail While Awaiting Third Trial On Spy
Charges ^By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only FBI agent ever convicted of spying
was granted bail Monday, enabling him to go free while he awaits a
new trial on charges he passed top-secret FBI information to a
Soviet woman who was his lover.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon set bail for Richard Miller at
$337,757, the amount Miller's sister, brother and a friend said
they could post in property.
   Kenyon was acting on orders from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which directed the lower court to set a bond Miller could
meet.
   Miller, who has been in a federal prison in Rochester, Minn.,
since his 1986 conviction, did not attend the brief hearing.
   Kenyon ordered that Miller be brought to Los Angeles for a
hearing next Monday to set a new trial date. It will be Miller's
third trial. His first jury deadlocked before a second jury
convicted him in June 1986.
   Miller's conviction was reversed in April on grounds that jurors
were allowed to hear too much about lie-detector tests Miller took
and failed.
   Kenyon, who had sentenced Miller to two life terms plus 50 years
in prison, initially refused to allow Miller's release on bail,
suggesting that the 52-year-old former agent might flee the
country. But the appeals court said there was insufficient evidence
that might happen.
   The corpulent Miller, who battled the FBI over his weight and
other problems during a lackluster 20-year career with the agency,
was depicted by prosecutors as a bitter, vengeful failure easily
recruited as a spy.
   Defense attorneys said Miller was a well-meaning FBI misfit who
dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a Soviet spy
network.
   Among those who testified against him was codefendant Svetlana
Ogorodnikov, who became his lover and allegedly enticed him into
spying. Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nickolay, pleaded guilty
to spying and are serving federal prison terms.
   Kenyon on Monday ordered that Miller be released to the custody
of former FBI agent Albert Sayers, a private investigator who
worked on Miller's defense, and that he not leave Los Angeles
without special permission.

   Slickered rescue crews, working in a
driving rain, on Monday recovered the body of a waiter who had been
buried in a beachfront landslide during last week's earthquake.
   The victim was identified by authorities as Gary Phillips West,
41, a San Francisco waiter from Napa. He had been missing since the
quake. His car was located in the Bonny Doon Beach parking lot
about 10 miles north of Santa Cruz, authorities said.
   West's body was found shortly before 2 p.m. Monday, the second
day of a search for him along the beach where a cliff gave way and
tumbled onto the sand.
   The National Guard, California Department of Forestry and Santa
Cruz paramedics helped in the search, using a front-end loader to
shovel and scoop dirt out of the 90-foot-high cliff. They were
assisted by a search dog amed Eros, said Capt. Mike Martin of the
California Department of Forestry.
   ``As they were trying to excavate the area, every time they
brought out a shovel full of dirt, more dirt was falling in,''
Martin said.
   The 30 to 40 rescue workers waded through muck and mud to search
the area, struggling to keep the front-end loader upright.
   The search had to be called off Sunday night at sunset because
of high tides and concern that more of the cliff would cave in,
Martin said.
   Martin said an autopsy would have to be performed before a cause
of death would be available.
   West, a waiter at the McArthur Park Restaurant in San Francisco,
was found wearing shorts and buried under 15 feet of rock and dirt,
Martin said.
   No air pockets were found that might have spared West's life,
said forest service Capt. Steve Delagadillo.
   Residents near the area noticed West's car and contacted
authorities. The victim's sister identified the car on Sunday and
the search was started.

   Almost one in four American adults would turn
over to the police a child of theirs if they caught that child
selling cocaine, according to a poll to be published Tuesday.
   Nearly one in three would turn in their best friend, according
to the poll results appearing in Tuesday editions of USA Today.
   About seven out of eight would turn in a stranger, according to
results made available on Monday by the newspaper
   Here is how the 814 respondents broke down on turning in someone
found selling cocaine: own child, 24 percent; best friend, 32
percent; stranger, 86 percent.
   Only half the respondents said the war against drugs could be
won, while 41 percent said it could not. Eighty-eight percent said
the drug problem is worse than most people realize.
   Seventy-one percent said they were worried ``a great deal'' that
someone they care about could become a victim of drug-related
violence, 58 percent said they feared drug use would result in the
ultimate decline of the country and 62 percent said they would be
willing to pay higher taxes to fight drugs.
   On taxes, 53 percent said they would be willing to pay between
$100 and $500 more.
   The newspaper's announcement did not say how the poll was
conducted or when. The likely margin of error is 3.5 percentage
points either way.

   Former federal judge Alcee Hastings
officially entered the 1990 Florida governor's race Monday, just
three days after the U.S. Senate removed him from the bench.
   ``I understand people will have a negative perception, but it
will be dispelled,'' said Hastings, who will run as a Democrat.
   Hastings, who became Florida's first black U.S. District judge
10 years ago, was removed Friday when the Senate convicted him in
an impeachment trial of conspiring to take $150,000 to fix a case.
   ``I got fired by people who didn't read or understand the
dynamics of the evidence as it was presented,'' said Hastings, who
was acquitted in a criminal trial. ``I believe myself to be a man
of honor and integrity. I have not committed any crime at any
time.''
   Hastings, who was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in
1970 and the state Public Service Commission in 1974, filed the
necessary paperwork with the state Division of Elections.
   He predicted victory despite the noteriety of impeachment and a
lack of funds and campaign organization.
   Also vying for the Democratic nomination are U.S. Rep. Bill
Nelson and state Sen. George Stuart of Orlando. If no candidate
wins a majority in the primary, the top two vote-getters would
advance to a runoff.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican, is running for re-election. He
faces a challenge for the GOP nomination by state Sen. Marlene
Woodson-Howard of Bradenton.

<TEXT>
   The leftist government Monday
threatened to retaliate against U.S.-backed rebels after a series
of attacks reportedly killed 20 people during a national voter
registration drive.
   Reacting to the fighting, President Daniel Ortega met with top
officials from the defense and interior ministries on Sunday, the
last of four registration days for the Feb. 25 general elections.
   In the bloodiest attack, Contra rebels ambushed two trucks
carrying military reservists Saturday near Rio Blanco, about 80
miles northeast of Managua, military officials said. Eighteen
soldiers were reported killed and eight wounded.
   In a communique Monday, the president's office said, ``Criminal
actions such as (Saturday's) ... will be punished with all the
energy and all the force that the laws of the republic allow for
this kind of offense.''
   The statement did not say exactly what measures would be taken.
   In separate remarks, Ortega accused the United States of
creating obstacles to the electoral process.
   ``They continue opposing demobilization of the Contras in
Honduran territory, they continue promoting a policy of
strangulation against Nicaragua and maintain financing of the
Contra armed mercenaries and now have approved financing of the
disarmed mercenaries,'' he said.
   In February 1988, Congress cut off military aid to the Contras
but it has continued non-lethal support, including $49 million
approved earlier this year.
   The latest aid package provides the Contras with food, medicine,
shelter, boots and other supplies. It contains a clause, however,
that allows the aid to be cut off if the Contras attack within
Nicaraguan territory.
   Most of the rebels are based in neighboring Honduras.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the top Contra military leader, has
denied the accusations by the leftist Sandinista government that
his troops in Nicaragua have been attacking.
   Instead, he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
from Honduras that the Sandinista army has been mounting a cleanup
operation against the rebels, who ``have to defend themselves.''
   The government has claimed the rebels are trying to disrupt the
election process. It also says they have gained the support of the
Nicaraguan political opposition, which denies the charge.
   Nicaraguans were allowed to register on the first four Sundays
in October. During the first three Sundays, the Supreme Electoral
Council said 1,336,342 citizens had registered of an estimated
total of 1,970,486 eligible voters.
   A top U.N. official on an election observer mission said rebel
attacks have impaired voter registration and expressed worry that
the fighting may increase.
   ``Regrettably, the electoral process is still marred in some
places by the continuing armed actions of some groups,'' Elliot
Richardson told reporters. The former U.S. attorney general is
serving as a representative for U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar.
   Electoral Council President Mariano Fiallos said at least 60
registration places had not opened during the registration period
because of actual or threatened Contra attacks.
   Ortega called early elections and pledged greater democracy in
Nicaragua in an accord with four other Central American leaders.
   In exchange, they agreed to dismantling the Contras by Dec. 7,
but the rebels say they won't disband until the Nicaraguan
government guarantees a general amnesty.
   Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a temporary cease-fire in
March 1988. However, they have been unable to reach a permanent
peace agreement, and there has been sporadic fighting since then.

   A former parliament member Monday urged
Solidarity deputies to follow Hungary's example and drop
``People's'' from Poland's official name, ``The Polish People's
Republic.''
   Ryszard Bender, a member of the previous parliament who lost his
race against Solidarity in June elections, had proposed in the last
parliamentary session that the country's name be changed and the
phrase inscribing the leading role of the party in the constitution
be eliminated.
   He outlined his latest proposal in a letter to the 160 members
of the Citizens Parliamentary Club _ the caucus of Solidarity
deputies in parliament. The official news agency PAP carried
excerpts of the letter.
   ``I appeal ... for the quickest possible legislative initiative
aimed at elimination of the name PPR (Polish People's Republic) and
restoration of the historic name of the Polish Republic,'' he wrote.
   The chairman of the Polish Historical Society made a similar
proposal earlier this month.
   Bender urged the Solidarity deputies not to fall behing Hungary,
which has restored its pre-communist name of the Republic of
Hungary.
   ``Last week, following a decision of the Hungary parliament, the
old name of the country was restored. The Stalinist People's
Republic of Hungary disappeared. And our country is still called
the Polish People's Republic,'' Bender said.
   ``Time is running out. Let's not remain far behind the
Hungarians,'' the letter said.
   Hungary and Poland are leading democratic reforms in the East
bloc, with Hungary firmly committed to free multiparty elections
and Poland having elected the first non-communist government in the
Warsaw Pact.

   Morehouse College announced Monday that two
students have been expelled because of a fraternity hazing that led
to a potential member's death last week.
   Eight other students were suspended for one year.
   Although officials did not release names of the students
disciplined, the college said all were members of the Alpha Rho
chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the nation's oldest black
Greek-letter fraternity. The fraternity had been suspended by the
college earlier.
   Joel Allen Harris, 18, of New York City, died Wednesday after
students interested in pledging the fraternity were allegedly
shoved when they did not answer questions correctly. Officials said
Harris had an enlarged heart, which contributed to his death.
   Cobb County police also are investigating.
   ``Clearly we want to send a message to fraternities that hazing
of any kind is not tolerated and will not be tolerated,'' Morehouse
spokesman Robert Bolton said Monday. ``From our standpoint, the
college defines hazing as harassment, mental and-or physical.''
   The penalties were decided by a Morehouse College judiciary
court, which included administrators and faculty members. Bolton
said at least two rules were broken: the pledging process began
before the sanctioned Oct. 19 date and hazing occurred.

   Left-wing rebels ambushed an army convoy on a
mountain road Monday and in the battle 13 soldiers and six
guerrillas were killed, the military reported.
   In a separate attack, guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path
movement killed nine peasants who had formed a self-defense group,
police said.
   A brief military report said Shining Path guerrillas attacked
the army convoy near Lachoj, 170 miles southeast of Lima.
   One army vehicle was struck by a dynamite bomb during the
ambush, it said.
   The military reported among the soldiers killed were two
lieutenants and two sergeants. It gave no further details.
   Police said Shining Path rebels killed the nine peasants in
Sallalli, a town 235 miles southeast of Lima in Ayachucho state.
   Another police report said that on Sunday the Maoist rebels
attacked the jail and a government office in Satipo, 186 miles east
of Lima, killing a local official and one policeman.
   It said the guerrillas attacked the prison with explosives and
gunfire but a special police unit repulsed the assault. The report
gave no indication that any prisoners had been freed or escaped. It
said Jesus Ore, 52, the top municipal official, and policeman
Mauricio Meza, 23, were killed.
   Authorities say the Shining Path movement has intensified its
attacks in recent weeks in its campaign against municipal elections
to be held next month.
   The government issued a decree Monday declaring a state of
emergency in four provinces in Lima state.
   It said the provinces of Cajatambo, Oyon, Barranca and Huaura,
about 100 miles north of Lima, were placed under emergency rule
because of the presence of subversives.
   Under the state of emergency the army is given control of the
area and constitutional guarantees are suspended.
   The Shining Path group began its anti-government campaign in May
1980 and it is estimated more than 15,000 people have been slain in
revolt-related violence since then.

   A centuries-old tradition of opium
poppy cultivation in Pakistan and Afghanistan has blossomed into a
major heroin industry during a decade of political turmoil in
Southwest Asia.
   It has spawned what many anxious Pakistanis call a ``heroin and
Kalashnikov culture'' of crime, referring to the preferred
automatic weapon of the region's drug lords.
   Most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboring
Afghanistan, where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attempt
to control their cultivation.
   Officials say the flowers' sticky yield of opium is refined into
heroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged
Pakistan-Afghan frontier. It is then spirited through Pakistan to
markets in the United States and Europe.
   Western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of the
heroin sold in Europe and 25 percent sold in the United States
comes from the so-called ``Golden Crescent'' region of Southwest
Asia.

   When El Ultimo de la Fila goes on stage,
rock singer Manolo Garcia strikes the pose of a matador, flamenco
dancers swirl and stamp to the sound of electric guitars and
screaming fans surge forward.
   Although lead guitarist Quimi Portet says the group plays rock
music, the back-up acoustic guitar, castanets and wailing vocals
that have become its trademark are unmistakably and traditionally
Spanish.
   Spain is synonomous with music, but only recently has home-grown
rock 'n' roll moved to center stage as the country witnessed
explosive growth in bands, concerts and record companies in the
past decade.
   When Elvis Presley, Little Richard and the Beatles hit the music
scene, Spaniards were living under a military dictatorship. But the
death of authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975 and
Spain's transition to democracy provided the cultural and political
context within which local rock could flourish.
   Rock bands soon became blatantly ideological in their lyrics and
entertained at political rallies and municipal gatherings as the
music became a banner for a cultural and political reawakening
known as the ``movida'' _ the happening.
   ``I don't think what happened was a cultural renaissance, or
anything like that,'' said rock singer Anton Reixa, ``What happened
is that people all of a sudden returned to the way they had always
been. Madrid of the `movida' of the early '80s was like the Madrid
of Arniches, Madrid of the `zarzuelas,' but with spiked hair and
pop music.'' (Carlos Arniches was an early 20th-century composer
who wrote for music halls; zarzuelas are operettas based on popular
themes.)
   Early Spanish rock was little more than an imitation of British
and American music, but musicians gradually began to experiment,
fusing rock with traditional styles.
   This experimentation led to the birth of flamenco-rock. Such
Groups as Triana (a neighborhood in Seville), were a precursor to
El Ultimo (the last in line). ``Triana'' excited listeners in the
late '70s with their mixture of rock and Gypsy-inspired Andalusian
folklore.
   The legalization of Spain's regional languages following the
return to democracy opened the way for groups such as Os Resentidos
(the Resentful), a band from Galicia that mixes raunchy, distorted
sounds of electric guitar and synthesizers with bagpipe music
typical of Celtic Galicia in northwestern Spain.
   The group, which started in 1982, played one of its first gigs
in a psychiatric hospital. It now has its own music videos and
continues to occupy alternative music charts with a bagpipe-rap
version of its hit ``Galicia Sitio Distinto'' (``Galicia, a
Different Kind of Place'').
   Spain's rock movement has been especially active in the small
northern provinces of the restive Basque country, home to some of
the most radical rock and punk groups. Basque separatism and
political activism have spawned bands such as the Basque-language
Kortatu, with its highly politicized mixture of rock, reggae, punk
and occasional Basque accordion riffs.
   ``There are many more bands now than at the beginning of the
'80s,'' said Madrid disc jockey Chusma Martin. ``But now there is
no sense of direction.''
   Martin says many radical groups, Basque and otherwise, still
exist, but they are being overshadowed by a new generation of
apolitical bands that opt for a variety of styles.
   Aficionados of punk, new wave, heavy metal and rockabilly, each
in the appropriate attire, roam the streets of Madrid and the
plazas of small Castilian villages. American-style country music
also has made an considerable impression on Spanish bands.
   ``I`m really bothered by so much music with American country
references,'' said Reixa. ``There can't be country in Spain. I'm
fed up with songs that talk about Cadillacs and bourbon.''
   Manolo Garcia of El Ultimo says the group will not go American
in order to expand its market.
   Despite this uncompromising approach and an aversion to
marketing blitzes, El Ultimo performs before sell-out crowds in the
country of 39.8 million and boasts record sales in the hundreds of
thousands.
   Their latest LP, ``Como la Cabeza al Sombrero,'' recorded with
DPI, a small, independent company, has been released in France and
will soon be distributed in Scandinavia.
   But Spanish rock has not had much success abroad. ``Los Bravos''
topped the U.S. charts in the early '60s with their
English-language ``Black Is Black,'' but little else has gone
beyond the Spanish market since.
   Several Spanish pop groups have begun to look toward Latin
America as a logical source of fans and record sales, but few have
made it big.
   ``The exchange with Latin America is minimal,'' said Madrid disc
jockey Rosa Perez, ``Spanish independent companies are simply
incapable of exporting music in large quantities to Latin America''
where audiences tend to prefer ballad singers such as Julio
Iglesias or more traditional styles.
   But the technopop group ``Mecano'' is an exception to the rule
with more than 1 million records sold from Mexico to Tierra del
Fuego.
   Both ``Mecano'' and ``Hombres G'' are among the few Spanish
groups picked up by multinational recording companies.
   ``El Ultimo'' is just breaking ground in Latin America where
Garcia and Portet took their low-key promotional rock tour to
Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico in July.
   ``Here in Spain we were considered a weird group when we
started, and in certain respects we still are over there,'' said
Garcia. ``The process taking place there is similar to what
happened here four or five years ago _ one of surprise and then,
little by little, gradually acceptance.''
   In Southern California, Portet said, the organizers tried to
sell them as a Hispanic group. ``That's fine, but we make music for
people, not for specific groups.''
   Although Os Resentidos have made it in their native Galicia and
on alternative lists in the rest of Spain, their first album was
put out in Portugal because Galego and Portuguese are more similar
than Galego and Spanish.
   Reixa is not optimistic about success in Latin America. ``They
know us a little in Argentina, but inflation is so high there and
with the economic crisis it's impossible to sell records, to play,
to do anything. And in Colombia, they're almost on the verge of a
civil war.
   ``What cracks me up is that we're most popular in places where
there's a lot of turmoil.''

<HEAD>Venezuelan Shark Fishermen Accused of Using Dolphins as Bait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalist groups, including the
Venezuelan Environment Ministry, charge that fishermen are killing
dolphins for bait to catch sharks.
   One group, Fundatropicos, claims that the shark fishermen are
harpooning thousands of dolphins a year to hook small sharks used
in a favorite Venezuelan delicacy called ``cazon.''
   Some fishermen and government officials deny the charges, but
the allegations have touched off a heated debate among
enviromentalists in Venezuela.
   The result has been conflicting press reports, confusion over
the number of dolphins killed, uncertainty about which fishermen
might be responsible, a call for a boycott of shark meat and an
open rivalry between two government ministries.
   ``Between 6,000 and 7,000 dolphins per year are killed by shark
fishermen using a system called trotline fishing,'' says Eduardo
Szeplaki, a biologist who is spearheading a campaign by
Fundatropicos. A trotline is a long fishing line with hundreds of
baited hooks attached to it.
   In July, the Environment Ministry identified 12 fishing boats
thought to be killing dolphins and the areas where the killings
were taking place.
   According to Szeplaki, Venezuelan fishermen got the idea of
using dolphins as shark bait from Asia. The dolphin meat is
fibrous, lasts as long as three days and is regarded as effective
in attracting sharks.
   Killing dolphins, while prohibited by Venezuelan law, also
enables fishermen to avoid having to buy bait.
   Daniel Novoa, director of the fishing section at the Venezuelan
Agriculture Ministry, describes Fundatropicos' accusations as
``completely without foundation.''
   He says nine Korean boats operating in Venezuelan waters may
have killed dolphins but departed more than a year and a half ago.
According to Novoa, Venezuela now has only four trotline shark
boats, despite Fundatropicos' claim of 17.
   While acknowledging the possibility of ``isolated cases'' of
dolphin killings, Novoa said captains of shark boats deny it.
   Salvador Bohir, director of an Environment Ministry animal
protection agency, disagreed with Novoa.
   ``I am far more realistic,'' he said. ``Yes, there are
irregularities.''
   In Venezuela the Agriculture Ministry is charged with marketing
and developing ocean resources and the Environment Ministry
oversees their protection and conservation.
   ``At times the marketing part takes precedence over
protection,'' said Jose Gregoria Garcia, an engineer at the
Environment Ministry. ``There must be greater communication and
team work.''
   Dolphins are protected by international accords in the Pacific,
where dolphins and tuna swim together and dolphins suffocate in
tuna fishermen's nets. Venezuela, which sends tuna fleets into the
Pacific, met the terms of those accords last year after a 38-day
tuna embargo by the United States.
   But no such accords apply to the Caribbean, which makes up
Venezuela's shoreline, and the shark fishermen, who are just 1
percent of the nation's fishing fleet.
   But Szeplaki maintains that nearly half of all species of
dolphin can be found in Venezuelan waters and that some species
might be in danger of extinction.
   Despite the accusations of dolphin killings in the press and
official circles, only one trotline shark boat has been sanctioned
so far. The Environment and Agriculture ministries said that
occurred in 1988 when the boat was found to have eight dead
dolphins aboard. It was fined 30,000 bolivars, less than $1,000.
   New legislation under consideration in the Venezuelan Congress
would increase penalties for killing marine mammals but would do
little to upgrade enforcement.
   However, the recent flurry of accusations has prompted
Venezuela's attorney general to open an investigation.
   Meanwhile, Szeplaki and others are asking Venezuelans to boycott
shark meat.

   Author Leslie Charteris was skeptical when
Simon Dutton, the 12th actor to play Simon Templar in ``The
Saint,'' told him his mother had named him for the famous
semicrooked detective.
   Charteris, who wrote the best-selling novels about the dashing
character, asked Dutton whether he actually had been named for the
character or if he'd made it up ``for the newspapers,'' the actor
said.
   ``When I assured him my mother was a fan he invited her to his
81st birthday party in London.''
   ``The Saint'' that Charteris created is a swashbuckler of
dubious morality, a ``Robin Hood of crime'' dedicated to justice.
Roger Moore, who played him on TV from 1967 to 1969, is perhaps the
best-remembered of those who have tackled the role.
   Dutton's version is part of the syndicated ``Mystery Wheel of
Adventure.'' Six two-hour movies of original ``Saint'' mysteries
are among the 10 shows being telecast by 102 stations.
   Since ``The Saint'' sought adventure all over the world, the six
new TV movies about him were filmed on location in London, Paris,
Berlin, Luxembourg and Australia. All the stories are original.
   Dutton met Charteris during a visit to New York. Charteris, born
Leslie Yin in Singapore of a Chinese father and an English mother,
is an American citizen who lives in England.
   His mysterious, urbane adventurer made his first appearance in
``Enter the Saint'' in 1930, the first of 45 novels. ``The Saint''
also has appeared in movies, television, radio and comic strips.
   When interviewed, Dutton, whose thick black hair is turning gray
at the temples, was just back from filming the final movie in
Sydney, Australia. He stopped here en route to his home in London.
   ``Simon Templar is really an adventure seeker,'' he said. ``He
becomes involved in the crimes in various ways. Maybe a friend gets
in trouble. He smells out danger and intrigue. He works both sides
of the law under various aliases. He's very much a product of
English public schools. His clothes are from Saville Row.
   ``He's from a wealthy, aristocratic family but probably from the
wrong side of the sheets. He's not a playboy. He makes his living
as a jewel thief. Charteris was very much influenced by Raffles,
the gentleman burglar. The heavies in the novels were based on real
people Charteris met in his travels.''
   The British actor, 31, has been on American television before.
He starred in a CBS movie based on Agatha Christie's ``Man in a
Brown Suit.'' He also was in the British miniseries, ``By the Sword
Divided,'' a story of the English civil war. That show was
televised in this country.
   Dutton, who also played Richard Gere's brother in the movie,
``King David,'' grew up in and around London and attended the
Central School of Speech and Drama.
   ``I started in repertory theater and my break came when I was
cast in `Another Country' in the West End,'' he said. ``Peter
Ustinov saw the play and cast me in his film `Memed My Hawk,' based
on a Turkish folk story about a Robin Hood type character.
   ``We never stopped laughing during the production. One actor
cracked a rib and begged Peter to stop telling stories because it
hurt to laugh. We'd come in every day and ask Peter to imitate a
new musical instrument. He never missed.''
   ``The Mystery Wheel of Adventure'' in which Dutton appears also
consists of three adaptations of books by Dick Francis and one
offbeat mystery called ``Star Trap.''
   ``The Saint'' has been played on radio by Vincent Price, Barry
Sullivan, Tom Conway, Brian Aherne and Edgar Barrier. In the movies
Louis Hayward, George Sanders, Hugh Sinclair and Jean Marais played
him.
   On television, Ian Ogilvy played him in ``Return of the Saint''
in episodes made in England nine years after Moore left the series.

   Construction workers carving out a
road for an elite Mediterranean resort bulldozed their way into an
ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand.
   They had stumbled upon a city more than 2,000 years old and
stretching for more than a mile along Egypt's coastline 125 miles
west of Alexandria.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Ali Hassan, who controls Egyptian
Antiquities Organization operations in the region. ``Other
countries get excited about finding an ancient house. We have a
whole city. It's without equal in all of Egypt.''
   The bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were
discovered in 1985. By that time, a road had been sliced through
what appears to have been an ancient temple, but much more remained.
   A few months later, Egyptian and Polish archaeologists began
excavating the ruins, without letting word out, and what they've
found over the last three years is in remarkable condition.
   ``What we have in hand is a golden egg, undisturbed, a complete
city that changed with time,'' said Hassan, director general of
Pharaonic monuments. ``It's not only a city of the dead, but also a
city of the living, side by side. It's something very rare and very
important.''
   The city, believed to have been founded in the second century
B.C., lasted more than 500 years. As excavators intruded on its
serenity since 1986, antiquities officials have worked quietly in
Cairo to save the site from further destruction.
   The still-unidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy
grave.
   To one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along
the coastline by Egypt's Ministry of Housing. A new apartment
complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be
the ruins.
   ``The site is under our protection,'' said Sayeed Tawfik,
chairman of the antiquities organization. ``Nothing can happen to
it now.''
   Only a small area has been excavated, but archaeologists already
have discovered well-preserved houses, vast cemeteries with
decorated and undecorated tombs, catacombs, a bath, a basilica and
many artifacts, imported and local, including statues and frescoes.
   Egyptian excavators are now at work. In February they'll be
rejoined by 10 Polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed
surveys of the site and its needs.
   They already have restored critical pieces that had begun to
disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road.
   Walking through the excavations, Feisal Mohammed Ashmy, the
antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city, pointed toward
mounds of toppled marble columns. They lay at the beside a ditch
cut 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep by the grading equipment.
   ``Before the bulldozers got here, this was a temple, I think.
It's terrible, but we now have to focus on saving what's left,'' he
said.
   ``There's so much. All you have to do is to look down, and
history says, `Take me.'''
   Early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along
Egypt's Mediterranean coastline. Villages of white houses, fishing
boats and nets, and later the domes of early Christian churches,
dotted the landscape. Vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and
almonds were plentiful. Families on outings sailed to outlying
islands to drink wine.
   W.A. Daszewski, head of the Polish Archaeological Institite in
Egypt and an expert in the Greco-Roman period, said he's delighted
with the find.
   ``This is a great opportunity for us to see how it was. It's a
unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this
period,'' he said in an interview.
   ``This was a landowners' city. ... They probably had farms
inland, but residents preferred to have their houses along the
coast because of the cooler climate.''
   Excavated houses are large, with complex systems that carried
rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns. Some are elaborately
decorated with pillars, niches, statues and delicate frescoes.
   ``The architectural decoration in the city is first class and
well-preserved,'' Daszewski said.
   Designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step
pyramids to magnificent, multistoried funerary complexes. Daszewski
said burials date from the second century B.C. to the end of the
third century A.D., but he believes the city existed in some form
until the early seventh century.
   Daszewski said he knows of two possible names for the city:
Leucaspis _ white shield _ which would refer to a sandspit that
protected the harbor; and Antiphre or Antiphra, a city mentioned as
late as the fourth century A.D. because of a bishop who hailed from
there.
   ``Both are possibilities, but we have a basilica here, so the
city existed during early Christian times,'' Daszewski said. ``I
rather think it's Antiphre, but it's possible the city was called
one thing, the harbor area another. We don't know.''
   The Polish and Egyptian archaeologists predict it'll be years
before excavation and restoration is completed.
   ``Maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe more,'' said antiquities official
Ali Hassan.

<HEAD>Government Candidate in Chile, Trailing in Polls, Turns Aggresssive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hernan Buchi, the pro-government
candidate for Chile's presidency, is waging an increasingly
aggressive campaign in hopes of eroding support for his opposition.
   In daily campaign appearances and statements, Buchi is
repeatedly accusing opposition contender Patricio Aylwin of acting
in concert with Marxist extremists and of condoning the scattered
acts of violence in what has been a largely peaceful campaign.
   He hopes to frighten middle-class voters away from Aylwin, a
moderate Christian Democrat heavily favored in most opinion polls
to win the Dec. 14 election to replace Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the
president since the military took power in 1973.
   The opposition confidently predicts the failure, however, of
Buchi's aggressive tack.
   ``It's a crass error,'' Carlos Huneeus, a pollster working with
the Aylwin campaign, said in an interview. ``It has nothing to do
with reality in Chile.''
   Pinochet was forced to call elections after Chileans, in a
yes-or-no ballot last year, rejected a proposal that he remain
leader until 1997. He is scheduled to hand power over to the new
president in March.
   Aylwin led a coalition of centrist and leftist parties that
campaigned for Pinochet's defeat in the referendum and is now its
sole presidential candidate.
   Buchi, 40, was Pinochet's finance minister for four years until
March and is backed by rightist political groups. A third candidate
is a populist banker-businessman, Francisco Errazuriz.
   In the first days of the campaign, after the candidates
registered in July, Buchi stressed his achievements as finance
minister. They include steady economic growth and low inflation, in
sharp contrast to other Latin American countries.
   But the message apparently has won him few backers. Polls in
early October indicated he is trailing Aylwin by as much as 30
percentage points. It was then he went on the attack.
   He charged that Aylwin has a ``secret pact'' with leftists who
had been prominent in the turbulent government of President
Salvador Allende, the Marxist who was elected to office in 1970.
Further, Buchi claimed, the leftists are likely to again plunge
Chile into the economic and social chaos that marked the Allende
years and prompted the 1973 coup.
   He blamed Aylwin's supporters for beating Buchi backers and
bombing some campaign offices.
   In a televised debate with Aylwin Oct. 9, Buchi hinted that his
opponent's backers might be responsible for the hit-and-run death
of a pro-Buchi labor activist. But a police investigation later
determined that he was killed in an ordinary traffic accident.
   Aylwin, a 70-year-old veteran statesman, has responded by
emphasizing his own reputation as a moderate and accuses Buchi of
waging an undignified and irresponsible ``scare campaign.''
   Aylwin's principal campaign message has been the need for
national unity to assure a democratic transition.
   But Buchi's backers contend that the Aylwin camp is guilty of
below-the-belt politics.
   ``They are trying to define the Dec. 14 election as a choice
between dictatorship and democracy, which is a lie,'' said Buchi's
campaign manager, Pablo Baraona.
   ``It is not dictatorship or democracy that is at stake here. It
is two democratic platforms.''
   Buchi has tried to distance himself from Pinochet, even
recommending publicly that Pinochet give up his command of the army
when the change in government takes place.
   Pinochet has said he plans to remain on as commander, a post
that the country's 1980 constitution allows him to keep for eight
more years.

<HEAD>Shooting Radicalizes Victim, Wife on Gun Control Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AK-47 bullets that blasted away his
left knee and right elbow also ended Mike Campbell's comfortable
detachment from the struggle over gun control.
   ``I've never been much of an activist,'' said Campbell, one of a
dozen survivors of Joseph Wesbecker's rampage at the Standard
Gravure Corp. printing plant. ``Obviously I am for gun control
now.''
   The ability of a mentally ill man bent on revenge to legally buy
a military-style, semi-automatic rifle has made his wife, Betty,
even more partisan.
   She has special contempt for legislators she sees as
complicitous to the extent they permit traffic in such guns and for
people who think ``that their right to carry a gun supersedes my
husband's right to carry his grandson.''
   The National Rifle Association is strong in Kentucky, where the
hunting is good and freedom of arms is cherished.
   But fallout from the Sept. 14 Standard Gravure shootings, in
which eight people died, may put the NRA on the defensive for the
first time in memory when the Kentucky General Assembly convenes in
January.
   Mrs. Campbell looks toward the session and the likelihood of
legislation to ban or limit the sale of ``assault'' weapons. ``I am
not a public speaker but I will support, in any way I can,
legislation to ban those kinds of weapons.''
   The NRA, which regularly fights such legislation as an
infringement on the Second Amendment right of citizens to ``keep
and bear arms,'' will be ready.
   The organization says that nothing _ not a waiting period, not a
ban on specific weapons _ would have prevented Wesbecker's mission
of vengeance against the company that ended his job because of his
mental illness.
   ``I think what's the real tragedy is that we use incidents like
this to propose restrictions on law-abiding citizens that will have
no effect on incidents in the future,'' said James T. Hayes, an NRA
lobbyist.
   ``How in a free society do you keep people like that man from
acquiring a firearm? I don't know what the answer is to that,''
Hayes said.
   A number of state officials now say they have an answer:
restrictions on assault weapons.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, long an opponent of gun control,
endorsed assault-weapon restrictions in the days after the
massacre. Two state lawmakers from the Louisville area said they
are ready to sponsor the legislation.
   U.S. Rep. Carroll Hubbard, a conservative Kentucky Democrat and
NRA ally, agreed four days after the shootings to become a
co-sponsor of legislation in Congress that would ban the domestic
manufacture of assault weapons.
   Wesbecker, 47, had an abundance of demons: two broken marriages
and a belief he had been injured by workplace chemicals and wronged
by Standard Gravure, which prints newspaper supplements and
advertising inserts.
   He had been placed on permanent disability leave because of
mental illness in 1988. It was shortly before a morning shift
change when he returned to the plant to say a gruesome good-bye.
   Besides the AK-47, which can shoot 40 bullets a minute,
Wesbecker had two MAC-11 semi-automatic machine pistols, a 9mm
semi-automatic pistol, a .38-caliber revolver, a bayonet and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to police.
   He carried the AK-47, the SIG-Sauer 9mm and extra ammo. The rest
was stashed in a gym bag under a stairwell. Police said Wesbecker,
having shot 20 people, apparently was heading for the arms cache
when he stopped, put the pistol under his chin and squeezed the
trigger.
   His shots killed eight others.
   Among the survivors, Mike Campbell, a tennis player who at 51
could easily pass for 40, was luckier than most, though grievously
wounded in both arms and both legs. His left knee was pulverized.
   As the couple's five daughters arrived one by one at the
hospital, and collapsed one by one in horror, Betty Campbell's fury
welled. ``I promised myself: `I am going to do something about
this.'''
   A day later, she faced reporters and television cameras for the
first time, eldest daughter Mary Campbell Ford in tears beside her,
and bristled.
   ``You see the devastation?'' she said. ``And anybody who thinks
a private citizen needs an assault gun, please justify it to this
child, to my husband and to his grandchild. You will not justify it
to me.''
   After 13 days in the hospital, Mike Campbell went home to the
house he and Betty have rehabilitated over 10 years. A hospital bed
awaited in the living room, as did an electric wheelchair and a new
cordless telephone.
   Doctors say the best Campbell can hope for is to walk with a
cane within the next three years. Then, Campbell said, doctors will
assess the amount of regrowth to bones in his knee; if there is
enough he might be a candidate for an operation that would allow
him to walk nearly normally.
   For now, Betty Campbell said Mike will be able to sit in the
gazebo, his favorite place, and watch the falling leaves of autumn,
his favorite time of year.
   She will be watching the legislature.

   SHAWL-I-COURT, Afghanistan (AP) _ For Hamid Ghulam, the
decade-long civil war is over and his six-year odyssey in exile
finished.
   The arid plains of southern Afghanistan are quiet again, the
sound of warplanes and exploding artillery shells replaced by the
rustle of the hot desert wind through the grapevines.
   Atop the shattered mud villages, above the tents pitched by
nomads and in the fields where camels graze, the black and white
and red and green flags of the Moslem resistance flutter in the
breeze.
   An undeclared truce exists between the soldiers defending the
government in Kabul and the mujahedeen guerrillas who rule the
countryside around Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city and
the cradle of its now-deposed monarchy.
   Despite the uncertainty of its durability, the peace is luring
thousands of refugees like Ghulam home.
   ``I could have stayed in Pakistan where I know my family would
be safe,'' said Ghulam. ``But believe me, I love this destroyed
country a thousand times more. I could never be happy anywhere
else.''
   In August 1983, Soviet tanks rumbled into Shawl-i-Court and
unleashed a fierce barrage lasting nearly 30 hours to rout
suspected guerrillas hiding inside the mud-walled compound.
   Ghulam, his family and a few of the other 1,000 families who
survived the barrage fled 120 miles to Pakistan, where they lived
with 170,000 other refugees in a camp near the desert town of
Chaman.
   Nearly 6 million Afghans are living in refugee camps in Pakistan
and Iran, the bases of the resistance groups trying to overthrow
the government of President Najib.
   Most Afghan refugees are anxious to return to a country where
war has been raging for 11 years. Even though the struggle shows no
apparent signs of ending, some like Ghulam have become impatient at
the lack of military victory or negotiated settlement and are going
home.
   International relief agencies and government officials estimate
about 100,000 Afghans have returned since the Soviet troops left in
February. But they acknowledge they cannot accurately gauge the
flow because of the country's porous borders and lack of any
central authority.
   ``I was born here,'' said Ghulam, a 33-year-old farmer, finally
back home. ``My father and grandfather were born here. This is home
and I want it to be my children's home. Why shouldn't we come back?
The Soviets are gone and God willing, peace will come soon.''
   It was before dawn when Ghulam, his wife and their two children,
his father, aunt, uncle and three cousins packed their belongings
and piled into a battered blue pickup truck, said goodbye to those
staying behind at the Chaman camp and headed for the border.
   Ghulam seemed apprehensive at first, wondering whether Pakistani
border guards would force them to turn back or demand steep prices
he could not pay.
   When the border guards waved them by and they plowed through the
sandy plain, the excitement on Ghulam's wizened face became as
infectious as a child's joy on Christmas morning.
   ``This is really Afghanistan. One day we'll all be back,'' he
said as the group headed toward Spin Buldak, the border post
captured by the guerrillas in November.
   ``Welcome to Free Aghanistan.'' The sign was spray-painted on
the side of a building on which a white flag had been planted.
   Beyond lay the remains of a once-bustling tourist information
center, a crumbling reminder of the Western hippy trail of the
early 1970s.
   A few guerrillas, their rifles strapped over their shoulders,
sat by a campfire in the center of the shattered buildings and
captured Soviet tanks. As Ghulam and his family chugged down the
road, weaving from side to side to avoid the huge potholes left by
years of neglect, his thoughts frequently turned to his two sons,
among the 700,000 Afghan children born in exile.
   ``All their lives they have seen mujahedeen coming in and out of
the house and they have idealized Afghanistan,'' he said. ``For
them, this is supposed to be the most beautiful country in the
world. I fear they may hate me for the deception.''
   Along the road cutting across what was once one of Afghanistan's
most densely populated provinces, there is now only destruction and
the tattered flags marking the graves of some of the 1.5 million
Afghans who have died in the struggle against the Marxist
government that seized power in April 1978.
   They passed through a guerrilla checkpoint and then turned down
a narrow dirt path, bouncing along the rocky, barren terrain,
weaving between the ox carts, the Land Rovers and huge trucks with
their cargoes concealed under burlap covers.
   They reached another potholed road lined with burned and rusting
shells of more than 100 Soviet tanks, armored personnel carriers
and rocket launchers. The destruction along the road was startling
_ a huge silo built by the Soviet lay in ruins and houses and
buildings lay in ruins. And in the midst of vast destruction, the
blue-domed masoleum of an Afghan king stood unscratched.
   Then, the 10-hour journey was over; they were home and it was
mealtime.
   The family sat cross-legged in the ruined house of an old friend
and guerrilla commander. All ate from the same plates _ their first
meal in ``Free Afghanistan.''

   After 40 years of Communist rule, much has
changed inside China. Much remains the same. Small factories and
other businesses are beginning to find their way into the peasant
villages, and villagers are finding jobs in the cities. But new
policies imposed by the conservative leadership that won June's
power struggle in Beijing may reverse that trend.

<DATELINE>PEACEFUL VILLAGE, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The road to Peaceful Village is a
ribbon of brown powder winding among the pale and dusty cliffs of
dry, northwestern China.
   The earth crumbles to the touch and seems to have no nourishment
in it. But nine generations of the Xu, Wei and Li clans that
comprise Peaceful have coaxed from it spare harvests of wheat and
beans.
   Asked to tell stories about the village, Xu Yunbao, 65, talks
about water. He tells how his ancestors walked 12 miles each day to
reach the nearest well, how a new well dug when he was a child
turned out to be too salty to drink.
   Less than 12 inches of rain falls in a good year. It is too dry
even for crickets: The hills at night are eerily silent.
   The great drought of 1929 forced Xu's family to move to a city
where, ironically, they made a living as water sellers. But after
three years, when the drought eased, they and other fugitives from
the village returned.
   Why?
   ``Our forefathers lived here, we were born here,'' explains Xu's
70-year-old brother, Yunnian.
   The stubborn loyalty of generations of Chinese peasants to their
ancestral homes has helped the Communist government for most of its
40 years of rule to keep country and city sharply separated,
preventing the development of peasant shantytowns around cities,
like elsewhere in Asia.
   The separation also kept the relative wealth of the cities from
filtering down to the villages, leaving many peasants without
electricity or adequate water supplies well into the 1970s. Some
villages still go without, while modern appliances such as washing
machines have become standard in urban homes.
   For most peasants, the mechanics of daily life remained
unchanged even while the Communists first collectivized and then
redistributed the land, closed temples, set up clinics and schools
and made other radical changes in the social and political fabric
of village life.
   But in the past few years the rural-urban barriers have begun to
crumble. An economic boom generated by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's embrace of the free market created millions of
construction jobs in cities, and young men flocked from the
countryside to fill them.
   Even more important, a bit of the city came to the countryside
in the form of small rural factories that by this year employed a
total of 95 million peasants, nearly a quarter of the rural work
force.
   For the first time, the peasants' ancient dependence on the
whimsies of weather was broken.
   The late revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung, a product of a
peasant family, said peasants should grow grain. Any other
endeavor, he said, was capitalistic. But under Deng's more flexible
rule, the Peaceful Village committee took out a loan and set up a
brick factory in 1985.
   Profits from that helped set up a calcium carbide factory, and
the two jointly have underwritten a new village-owned poultry and
pig farm and new primary and middle schools.
   Other villages have used the profits from similar factories to
build irrigation ditches, pave streets, install electricity and
open small stores in the first significant infusion of investment
funds the Chinese countryside has ever seen.
   Nearly one-fifth of Peaceful's 500 families have a member
working in one of the factories or on the poultry farm, bolstering
family income with a guaranteed monthly wage of about $32, more
than double the per capita earnings from the land and close to the
average monthly salary for urban workers.
   Deng's open policies also included accepting outside help, such
as a $55 million World Food Program grant that helped build pipes
and pumps to carry water from the Yellow River, 16 miles away. The
Chinese government contributed $222 million.
   Since the project was finished last year, a network of ditches
brings river water to nearly half the fields in Peaceful and other
villages in the region, and families can draw water from cisterns a
few yards from their homes.

   ``Things are pretty good here now,'' says 35-year-old Xu
Zhengqie, squatting alongside a dirt path with a few of his
neighbors, watching another man driving a tractor over newly
harvested wheat to thresh it. They smoke and chat in the morning
sun, waiting their turn.
   Xu says his acre and a half yielded enough wheat to feed his
family of four. But less rides on the harvest now. He earns a
steady $270 a year driving a jeep for the local government.
   Like most of his neighbors, Xu is saving up to build a new
house, bigger than the three rooms of clay brick he has now. He has
already helped set another trend by replacing his traditional kang,
a heated sleeping platform for the whole family, with a
Western-style bed.
   ``It's more modern,'' he says proudly. ``We slowly learn from
the cities.''
   But the rural mini-boom _ no more than five years old in most
villages _ may be coming to an end. A yearlong clampdown on
construction, intended to curb nationwide inflation of more than 25
percent, has sent millions of peasants home from the cities.
   Thousands of rural factories have been forced to close because
they take raw materials and energy needed by the behemoth state
companies. Many rural companies consistently out-perform the state
businesses in productivity, but the conservative leaders who won
June's power struggle in Beijing say state factories must get
priority as a pillar of the socialist system.
   Rural factories rank lower ideologically: They are owned by
village or township governments or by individuals and operate
outside the state-planned economy.
   The leaders acknowledge the new policies will hurt rural
residents but have offered no solutions. Officials in Gansu
province, where Peaceful is located, insisted they had no figures
for the number of Gansu peasants put out of work. Officially there
is no such thing as rural unemployment: Everyone is considered to
work on the land.
   Despite rapid growth _ rural industrial output has grown more
than 30 percent a year since 1985 _ village factories have only
begun to shrink the huge gap between rural and city life.
   If this growth slows markedly or reverses, life in Peaceful will
remain more in the 19th century than the 20th. Only the new
cisterns and the television sets in many homes would greatly
startle any long-gone ancestor who paid a visit.
   Even the new houses, with shiny red doors and black tile gates,
use paper for windows and coal cooking stoves for heat. Life
remains a round of chores to be tackled with a strong arm and back.
   A cart loaded with produce is as likely to be pushed by two
peasants as pulled by a mule or tractor. Xu and his neighbors
gathered their harvest by hand, and although a tractor helped with
the threshing, they used rakes to separate the grain and chaff.
   Wang Yuhua, a soft-spoken woman who came to Peaceful 23 years
ago as a teen-age bride, was asked how she spends her free time.
``I cut grass for the pigs,'' she said.
   A large picture of Mao and the Red Army general Zhu De decorates
Wang's home, but she only giggles uncomfortably when asked if this
means she thinks Mao was a great leader. Questions about politics
and ideology fall flat in Peaceful: People look to results and are
content as long as the economy prospers.
   ``We can't leap ahead, we will have to remain backward for a
while,'' says Yan Bolin, vice magistrate of Gaolan county, which
includes Peaceful, professing support for the central government's
clampdown on economic growth.
   But Bolin is confident the clampdown will bypass Peaceful and
all of Gaolan. ``We didn't develop factories blindly,'' he says.
``We've tried to emphasize products that were needed.''
   When Beijing talks about over-heated investment, he adds,
``They're certainly not talking about us.''
   Rural officials elsewhere expressed similar hopes: that their
factories would be considered too useful, too profitable or too
innocuous to warrant closure.
   ``China is very big so it's not possible to act quickly,'' one
government worker said.``Sometimes the old policy has not been
carried out and there's a new one.''

   It was just after the Lunar New Year last
February that an army of up to 2.5 million peasants rode the rails
to this city in southern China in search of fortune.
   The crush came after migrant laborers working in Canton and the
surrounding Pearl River delta returned home for the holiday and
told fellow villagers of the high wages at the region's toy,
textile and garment factories.
   Most of the peasants quickly returned home because the region
could not absorb such a sudden and massive influx of unskilled
labor. But smaller waves have continued to pour into the delta.
   On the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, this coastal region
of Guangdong province is indeed China's land of plenty. Lush green
rice paddies, orchards and rolling hills spread from the meandering
Pearl River. Villages of aging gray brick houses and ostentatious
three-story, tiled villas vie for space with factories throughout
the countryside.
   But the region's development has more to do with markets than
Marx.
   Referring to the decade of market-oriented economic reform under
senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Yi Kun Cheng, vice governor of
Heshan county near Canton, says, ``The 10-year open policy has been
a golden time for China and Heshan.''
   Neither he nor other local officials who recently met with
foreign reporters offered praise of the preceding 30 years of
Communist rule, when ideology was stressed over profit.
   Now the party's conservative leaders in Beijing, who
consolidated power after quashing the spring pro-democracy
movement, want to reign in coastal regions such as the delta that
have acted with growing autonomy in recent years.

certainly is tension'' as co AND RADIO OUT

   A nearly forgotten program of World War II,
called V-12, turned out 60,000 Navy and Marine Corps officers _ and
changed their lives. Recently those old warriors got together to
rehash what V-12 meant to them. The writer of this story, a retired
Associated Press editor and Marine veteran of World War II and the
Korean War, was one of them.

   The meatloaf on the metal mess trays had the
taste and the look of old times for the aging men in
gold-emblazoned Navy blue baseball caps.
   The gold read: NAVY V-12. And as they chowed down on Navy bean
soup, meatloaf, steamed carrots, mashed potatoes, fruit salad and
lots of coffee, they laughed and needled and talked about V-12.
   Navy V-12? Hardly anybody remembers it except the men who were
in it and the families who have endured stories about it. Now these
men were here on a mild fall weekend to celebrate what V-12 had
meant to them and to the country. They called the meeting the Navy
V-12 National Colloquium, a fancy name for organized talk. The talk
was plain and not always organized.
   If all the talk had been condensed into a theme, it might have
been: V-12 was the turning point in my life.
   V-12 gave boys who grew up in the Depression a chance at
college. It furnished officers for the Navy and Marine Corps. It
trained leaders for the future. It kept small schools alive.
   All that happened because the Navy saw that the World War II
draft was devouring potential officer material, and it looked like
a long war. So with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's blessing, the
Navy created V-12, a program to put college men in uniform and get
them ready for midshipmen's schools and Marine officer candidates
school.
   When the program ended, it had produced more than 60,000 Navy
and Marine Corps officers.
   Many of its trainees went on to become prominent:
   Former Senate Majority Leader and former White House Chief of
Staff Howard Baker, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,
former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, former Commissioner of
Baseball Bowie Kuhn, Heisman Trophy winner Angelo Bertelli, former
Washington Redskins Coach George Allen, actors Jack Lemmon and
Jackie Cooper, ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson.
   Invitations to the national colloquium, the first since the
program began 46 years ago, went to about 17,000 known V-12s. Their
names had been tracked down for a history of V-12 by James G.
Schneider, chairman of Kankakee, Ill., Federal Savings and Loan and
a V-12 at Milligan College in Tennessee and Duke University. Ann
Landers ran a letter from Schneider about the colloquium, and her
column produced about 2,000 replies.
   About 260 Navy men and 20 Marines turned out. Wives were there,
too, about 100 of them. That was enough to dominate a luxury hotel,
filling the bars, the elevators, the dining rooms, the meeting room
and the banquet room with blue and gold caps.
   Only one of the big names showed.
   Baker, Moynihan and Laird had been scheduled on the program.
Carson had been invited to be on it.
   Moynihan and Laird pleaded intervening business. Carson wrote
that ``the tremendous constraints on my time'' prevented him from
coming.
   ``That's joke No. 1,'' said Peter Hackes of NBC News,
introducing a humor session.
   Baker found time to drop by the mess tray lunch with a wave for
his old compadres.
   But big names hardly mattered. The men were here to see old
friends and make new ones and, mainly, to talk about old times.
   Some asked why so comparatively few had registered.
   ``As usual, the Marines were just looking for a few good men,''
said an old Marine.
   And the organizers said after all, this was a first, and it's
hard to get the word out to that many men. People move, addresses
change. And there was the cost of four days in Washington. Some
wrote from the West Coast that if the colloquium had been in the
middle of the country _ say, Chicago or Kansas City _ they would
have made it.
   ``Yes, it's expensive,'' said Navy veteran Fred S. McClory of
Glenview, Ill., ``but it may also be the chance of a lifetime.''
   That lifetime for V-12s began on July 1, 1943. High school
graduates, college students and men from the fleet reported to
units at 131 colleges ranging in national prominence from Harvard,
Yale and Notre Dame to Arizona State Teachers College, Louisiana
Polytechnic Institute and Valley City State Teachers College in
North Dakota. Forty-one of those units had Marine detachments.
   Crammed with math, physics and military discipline, the V-12s
went on to Navy midshipmen's schools or Marine officer candidates
school _ and from there to billets at sea and in the field.
   After their service, thousands became corporate executives,
business owners, doctors, lawyers and judges, bankers, prominent
newspaper and television newsmen, educators and ministers.
   The men at the colloquium had registered from 104 of the 131
V-12 schools.
   They stood at attention at the opening reception to salute the
colors and sing full-throated versions of ``The National Anthem,''
``Anchors Aweigh'' and ``The Marines Hymn,'' played by a college
Naval Reserve drum and bugle corps whose members looked young
enough to be their grandchildren.
   And they told their sea stories. There was the one about the
Navy chief who warned his men to fall out for the next inspection
in whites just out of the laundry. So one fell out with his uniform
still dripping wet.

   Then there was the Marine who confessed that he forgot to unload
his rifle while on a field exercise, accidentally kicked it and
shot himself in an embarrassing place.
   There were wild stories about liberty in towns near their
schools, tales of learning what they thought was the manly military
art of drinking, stories of circumventing the rigors of math and
physics, close-order drill and calisthenics and curfews for their
dates at religion-oriented schools.
   And they talked about why they came to the meeting.
   ``V-12 was pure luxury for a child of the Depression,'' said
John Scott Davenport of Columbus, Ohio, a Marine trainee at
Redlands University in California.
   And it was more. An educator told why.
   Meldrim F. Burrill of Irvine, Calif., stocky, ruddy and erect at
84, was a Los Angeles public schools administrator commissioned as
a Navy commander to skipper the V-12 unit at Colorado College.
``Nothing in my lifetime has been as significant in education as
the V-12 program,'' he said.
   V-12, as he and others pointed out, not only gave
Depression-strapped young men a start on education, a commission
and leadership experience, it also saved many small schools from
going under in a wartime shortage of male students and funds.
   Back in 1943, Robert J. Wisner was a poor boy from Decatur,
Ill., struggling to work and stay in school and afraid he wouldn't
make it.
   Today, sharp features framed by a mane of white hair, he is a
mathematics professor at New Mexico State University and travels
around the country teaching other professors how to teach.
   Wisner, a Wabash College V-12 who served on a rocket ship in the
invasion of Okinawa, said: ``V-12 was the most important event in
my life. Without it, I might not have been able to finish my
bachelor's degree, probably wouldn't have gone on to a master's,
and certainly not to a Ph.D.''
   Donald H. Smith, like Wisner, was struggling to stay in school.
He enlisted as a Marine and V-12 kept him in the unit at Yale. He
was commissioned, led a company in Korea and served for 20 years,
retiring as a lieutenant colonel.
   His retirement pay let him fulfill his ambition to become an
Episcopalian priest, and that led him to Abaco, Bahamas. Burly and
silver-haired, with a pink, cherubic face, he ministers to a
poverty-ridden, all-black parish in an area so poor there are no
telephones.
   William A. Cox, who had no idea what he wanted to be after high
school, went to medical school after the war because of his Navy
education, then served 17 years as an Army doctor and now is a
heart surgeon in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Jack M. Osborn's Navy schooling led him into medicine, too. He
is in private practice and a colonel who runs a National Guard
hospital unit at Los Alamitos, Calif. Why? ``Because the Navy
taught me to love the military.''
   Thadeus Marcyan of Northbrook, Ill., hadn't planned to attend
the reunion. But the husky Marine's small wife took care of that.
   ``I told him I was sick and tired of listening to V-12 stories
and he had to come here and relive his old experiences,'' Helen
Marcyan said. She laughed. ``I was still in high school in the war,
and a nun who had two nephews in V-12 told me that all V-12s were
wonderful heroes, and maybe that's why I fell for him.''
   But in those threatening war days there were moments of low
morale, impatience and doubt. The men had enlisted to fight the
Japanese and the Germans _ and here they were, in uniform but still
in college.
   Crawford Gates, a Navy V-12 at landlocked Valley City State
Teachers College wrote a ``V-12 Victory Song'' that throbbed with
youthful fervor. The first verse went like this:
   ``Rolling, rolling over tossing waters
   ``That's the life for you and me.
   ``O rolling, rolling like our Navy's fathers
   ``Who died for liberty.''
   V-12s were in the Normandy invasion and in the Pacific from
Saipan through Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
   Men who stayed in the reserve were called back for the fighting
in Korea. Some shipped over as regulars, fought in Vietnam and
became Navy captains and admirals, Marine colonels and generals.
   Now, on a cool Washington afternoon, these old salts had orders
to fall out _ uniform of the day: ball caps and sports clothes _
and march six blocks to the Navy Memorial. The march of men and
wives could best be called a straggle.
   But at the memorial, they pulled together into a tight group
around a heroic bronze statue of a lone sailor, legs braced and
shoulders squared as if against a gale. Then they reverently laid a
wreath in tribute to fighting men of the sea. This was the time for
memories of combat and buddies lost.
   At the final banquet, the Sea Chanters, a mixed chorus of the
U.S. Navy Band, sang. When ``Anchors Aweigh'' began, the voices of
the V-12s, their first reunion nearly over, swelled again,
inundating the chorus' special arrangement with billows of sound.
   And finally there was a resolution: that another Navy V-12
National Colloquium be held in 1993, the 50th anniversary year, at
an appropriate place and time.
   The ``ayes'' had it with a roar.

   Mud, in his eye, is as glamorous as concrete.
And as useful, in building houses poor people can afford. But while
the ideas of Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy have been readily
accepted in the American West and elsewhere, he has found mostly
frustration in his homeland.

<TEXT>
   In his youth, Egyptian architect Hassan
Fathy was determined to find a way to house the world's poor.
   As years became decades, others sought answers in steel and
concrete. Their high-rises grew higher. Their little boxes dotted
hillsides.
   But Fathy, looking to the magic beneath him, turned mud bricks,
volcanic rock and sand into design masterpieces. For generations of
young architects, he became a prophet, a Picasso of the earth.
   His sweeping domed creations with shaded courtyards and latticed
windows mellowed the harshness of the relentless desert sun against
the expanse of a windblown Sahara.
   They are seen not only in the Middle East but on a sun-baked
mesa in the American West, reviving the use of mud brick, or adobe,
in the Islamic community Dar al-Islam in Abiquiu, N.M.
   In the land of his birth, however, where housing problems are
acute, Fathy's remarkably simple solutions remain stillborn.
   Unable to convince either successive Egyptian governments or the
poor that mud is as glamorous as concrete, Fathy has found a
following mainly among Egyptian intellectuals and Western
architects.
   Now 89 and in ill health, Fathy has seen his world narrow, but
not his dreams. Surrounded by slender minarets, Saladin's lusty
Citadel and scores of cats, Fathy struggles in his aerie above Old
Cairo to complete projects for three Egyptian oases.
   He's nearly done.
   ``People say to use mud bricks for housing is to take a step
backward, but in reality it's turning forward,'' Fathy said in an
interview. ``Concrete blocks bear no human reference ...
   ``It's disgusting when you lose hope, when you think your ideas
are not being accepted in the right way, when people you want to
serve can't grasp, don't want to understand. Every day in Egypt,
around the world, babies and children are dying from improper
housing.
   ``I have the answer, but nobody will listen. The answer is under
foot.''
   An admirer is Britain's Prince of Wales, an architectural critic
who pays homage to Fathy in his just-published book ``A Vision of
Britain.''
   ``A movement is developing which seeks to rediscover the Islamic
and indigenous heritage, and to learn from the local environment
the wisdom of ancestors, who knew so well how to build
appropriately for the prevailing climatic conditions,'' Prince
Charles writes.
   ``People in the Middle East are now listening with increasing
interest to a remarkable Egyptian architect called Dr. Hassan Fathy
who, for 40 years, has had to put up with persistent vitriolic
criticism and denigration by the modernist architectural
establishment.''
   Even so, the world's poor, some 800 million, remain out of
reach. For them, Fathy says, there is no hope of decent housing
until officials take a different view of their plight.
   ``Government officials cannot grasp how poor poor is,'' he wrote
in the now-classic ``Architecture for the Poor,'' standard reading
in architecture courses around the world.
   ``Abandoned by God and man, (the poor) live out their short,
diseased and ugly lives in the dirt and discomfort to which they
are born. They need decent houses, but houses are expensive.
   ``None of the apostles of mass production and prefabrication
seem to realize just how poor an Egyptian peasant is. There is no
factory on Earth that can produce houses these villagers can afford.
   ``How can people so poor that they cannot even afford to buy
ready-baked bread even dream of a factory-made house.''
   Fathy says governments can save money and spur initiative by
letting peasants form cooperatives to do the work themselves and
encouraging them to use free or cheap materials according to their
environment: mud, stone, limestone, wood or reeds.
   ``Once when a man wanted to build a house, he would launch into
some of the most complex and prolonged decision-making of his
life,'' Fathy says. ``It used to be the house of my father where
every step had a meaning. Today, it is the house of my Uncle Sam,
where every step has a dollar value.''
   Peasant housing in Egypt, he says, is vastly inferior to ancient
housing, mud-brick structures that often outlasted even pyramids.
Domed, with mud-brick walls arched to give life and air,
traditional housing gave way to what is seen in the Egyptian
countryside today, low-slung hovels filled with smoke from cooking
fires.
   Fathy struggled to discover what the ancients knew, how to shape
and curve mud bricks.
   In 1941 his search took him to the southern Egyptian village of
Gharb Aswan, where tradition hadn't clashed with modern technology.
   ``Every house was a wonder, every house different,'' he says.
``A whole village of spacious, lovely, clean and harmonious houses,
each more beautiful than the last.''
   The impact is evident in any Fathy design. In 1980 he and two
village masons soared arches and domes into the New Mexico sky for
America's first mud-brick mosque.
   ``The Americans were willing, but not the Egyptians,'' he says.
``Americans have no inferiority complex. They're open-minded.''
   That thought led Fathy to recall his greatest heartache:
   In the 1940s, the Egyptian government wanted to shift the 6,000
inhabitants of Gourna, a village on the west side of the Nile
opposite present-day Luxor. Officials hoped transplanting the
population would end a bustling centuries-old local business of
tomb robbing.
   Hired to construct a mud-brick village, Fathy wanted each house
to suit the needs of an individual family. His ideals, however,
immediately clashed with bureucratic dicta that said the poor were
too ignorant to decide for themselves. Officials stopped the
project, the families were not transferred, and buildings that had
been finished remained empty, a ghost town.
   Fathy chronicled his dashed hopes in ``Architecture for the
Poor.'' ``A peasant never talks about art,'' he wrote. ``He makes
it.''
   Fathy spent the next years designing public and private
buildings in his homeland, his stunning use of mud brick and other
natural materials gradually earning him an international reputation.
   ``When Hassan Fathy begins to design a house, he never thinks if
he's building for a prince or a pauper,'' says Nawal Hassan, a
friend and adviser.
   The Aga Khan Foundation, which recognizes Islamic architectural
excellence, gave Fathy its first Chairman's Award in 1980, noting
``his commitment to the poor and his extraordinary aesthetic
sense'' and hailing him as a ``champion of indigenous building.
   ``Hassan Fathy has taught us the value of ... environment,'' the
jury said. ``He has shown us that the lessons to be learned are
modern lessons.''

   They are the quick-strike force in California's
war on forest fires. From nine helicopter bases around the state,
airborne firefighters attack small wildfires in an attempt to
contain them before they spread. It's a job with no little peril
since they often have no escape route.

   Helicopter 901 clattered toward the towering
pillar of smoke with six men and a woman who would charge the
wildfire alone, with only hand tools and little chance of getting
away if things went badly.
   Just two weeks before, a firestorm had trapped a crew from the
helicopter attack, or helitack, base in Vina. With no escape route,
the firefighters weahered the inferno inside heat-resistant fire
tents. It was too much for one of the firefighters, who panicked
and ran. He was rescued by a crew captain, and later was fired.
   Since 1973, one member of California's airborne firefighting
corps has been killed and 11 have been seriously injured.
   Aboard Helicopter 101, Fire Protection Capt. Dan Burns of the
state Department of Forestry explains that once the helicopter
drops off the firefighters, they are largely on their own.
   ``We're breaking all the rules by going in in front of the fire
and watching our escape route fly away,'' he says.
   The idea is to swiftly control a small fire before it gets big.
   California, which claims to have the largest firefighting force
in the world, places more emphasis on helitack than does the U.S.
Forest Service, which has had to reduce crew sizes to five or less
due to budget cutbacks. California, with nine helicopter bases, has
more helitack units than any other state.
   ``Air 901 is five minutes out,'' radioes pilot Jim Costa, his
eyes scanning the flames racing over a mountain on a rugged
oak-studded ranch in Tehama County, northwest of Chico.
   Gloved hands of the crew members recheck yellow fire-resistant
suits, plastic helmets and belts bristling with up to 30 pounds of
gear.
   Each member of the crew, reduced by one to make room for a news
reporter, packs a book-size pouch containing one of the
heat-reflecting ``shake and bake'' tents they may have to dive into
if they are overtaken by fire.
   Hand signals flash across the cramped compartment of the
lime-green UH-1F ``Huey'' helicopter, one of the workhorses of the
Vietnam War.
   Suddenly, the helicopter tilts so the crew is staring out side
windows at flames below. As 901 circles the blaze, the two crew
captains and pilot _ in a clipped language of their own _ pick a
landing zone and path of attack for the firefighters.
   ``This is the kind of fire that will be up to us to hold,'' says
Burns, the 35-year-old lead captain.
   Air tankers dispatched to drop fire retardant had yet to arrive.
Fire engines were still lumbering over winding roads miles away.
   The chopper touches down in an explosion of dust at the base of
the mountain. The crew swings into action.
   Some pull shovels and hoe-like brooms from an outside
compartment, uncomfortably close to searing jet exhaust spewing
into the 100-degree day.
   Others unpack a bag and hook it under the helicopter so the
ship, stripped of the crew's weight, could drop water from a nearby
pond on the blaze and on the firefighters if things go badly.
   The crew bounds up the mountain.
   The helicopter that should have lifted off behind them did not.
An air controller in a small fixed-wing airplane overhead had
ordered it to hold. Within seconds, an air tanker roars over
dropping retardant. The helicopter climbs and swings toward the
pond.
   Burns waves half the crew one way around the fire; Capt. Mike
Rivas, with the rest, goes the other way. Flames lick at their
elbows as they hack control lines through walls of smoke.
   Fire snakes through grass, dying at the control line. An inferno
in an oak tree dies in a crushing torrent of water dumped by the
helicopter.
   Twenty minutes after landing, there came cheers of victory. The
firefighters had linked up after encircling the fire. Their job was
done: Ground crews were arriving.
   The engine crews would handle ``mop up,'' the tedious,
slog-through-the-ashes job of dousing every last ember.
Investigators would probe the cause, but it was evident. A jeep,
pile of firewood and chainsaw had been abandoned on the hilltop.
   The helitack crew, which had held the blaze to three acres,
would fly back to base to be in place for the next run.
   The helicopter is playing an increasing role in wildland
firefighting because it is more like a fire engine than an air
tanker, according to a recent state study. Besides shuttling a
helitack crew and dropping water, it can be used for
reconnaissance, rescue, evacuation and cargo delivery.
   The effectiveness of the program is reflected in this year's
statistics in California. As of Sept. 25, 6,056 fires had burned
68,880 acres, down from last year's 6,831 blazes over 167,696 acres.
   The human cost of the 16-year-old program is high at times.
   Helitack crewman Denis Lee Cullins was burned to death in a 1987
fire in Northern California's Mendocino region.
   The Vina crew itself was forced to deploy fire shelters as a
wall of flames roared at them during Lassen County's Eagle fire in
July.
   ``We could hear the fire and the wind roaring from inside the
tents,'' says Mike Weaver, a 22-year-old crew member with five
years of helitack experience.
   A firefighter with less experience ran instead of deploying a
fire tent. Rivas, 33, finally was able to hold up one of the
shelters so he and the firefighter could stand behind it.
   ``It wasn't planned. I wasn't trying to be a hero or anything,''
Rivas says.
   No one was injured, but the firefighter was fired.

   Clinging to the southern flank of
the Mount McKinley massif is a snug shelter of glass and wood, a
place with an indoor view of one of the world's most astounding
outdoor scenes.
   People come to the Sheldon Mountain House to climb staggering
walls of gray rock ringing the Ruth Glacier, to ski or just to look

America's tallest peak, and its cousins, Mount Dan Beard and the
ragged Rooster Comb. They listen to the quiet of the Alaska
twilight, hear the wind and the sliding snow.
   The hexagonal house is a simple place in an extraordinary
environment.
   The structure can become a solarium as sun beats through the
large windows on five of six sides. The building, at 5,810 feet,
also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the Alaska Range.
   The house, in a glacial amphitheater with a clear view of
20,320-foot McKinley's summit, is a half-hour flight from
Talkeetna. The trip takes in the confluence of three rivers, miles
of scrubby black spruce and brown tundra, dozens of ponds, brown at
first and then brilliant blue as the glacial moraine appears below.
Toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones through a
gorge.
   The late bush pilot Don Sheldon designed the Mountain House and
supervised its construction in 1966. He acquired five acres in the
Ruth Amphitheater before it became part of Denali National Park and
Preserve.
   The house was built for use by mountaineers, photographers and
sightseers.
   ``It's been booked solid for the last five or six years,'' says
Roberta Sheldon, who was the radio operator when her husband landed
ski-equipped airplanes on Ruth Glacier. ``It's been a gradual
evolution, just like the growth of the tourist industry in
Talkeetna.''
   The house is perched on a jagged outcropping about 100 feet
above a snowfield that serves as a runway.
   ``The glaciers are moving and changing,'' Sheldon says. ``It was
hard to find a stable place to build the house.''
   Once it was built, the 196-square-foot house proved up to the
test of 20 years of harsh weather and seasonal occupancy.
   Sixty-five dollars buys a night's lodging and wood for the
stove. An outhouse stands 50 yards away.
   The house is furnished with four cushioned benches that double
as beds. Visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their own
food, although previous occupants have left supplies. Cereal,
canned stew, four kinds of mustard, pancake mix and real maple
syrup are among the provisions.
   Packed along two walls of the one-room house is more culinary
equipment _ including a wok _ than many home kitchens can claim.
   There are things to read in this mountain studio, as well. Books
and magazines line part of a shelf, along with Scrabble and other
games. A chin-up bar fashioned from a stick of firewood, a
mountaineer's carabiner and nylon webbing hangs from the slanted
ceiling.
   But for the landings and takeoffs by planes that use the
ice-and-snow runway below the house, it would be insulated from the
world outside. At the height of the summer tourist season, light
planes carrying sightseers interested in 10 minutes on Ruth Glacier
land several times an hour.
   Noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come and
go, the snow acting as a brake that allows them to land in
one-fourth the space needed for takeoff.
   Users of the Mountain House over the years have included
organized mountaineering groups. Genet Expeditions of Anchorage
rented the building during the month of May for several years, with
the house serving as a base of operations and clients sleeping in
tents nearby.
   ``It was nice to be able to dry out gear,'' said Mike Howerton,
Genet Expeditions general manager and a guide. ``It just made for a
more comfortable recuperation area.''
   The house also has served as a base for mountain rescues.
   Howerton warns against a casual attitude about activities in the
Ruth area. Precautions that would be adequate in many other
cross-country ski areas aren't enough here. He recommends skiers
rope themselves together for safety in case one falls into a
crevasse while crossing the snow.
   ``It's a hassle, but skiing roped is the only way to go up
there,'' Howerton says. ``It's a place where you have to be very
careful.''

   Time is on Peter Noone's mind these days.
   The former lead singer of Herman's Hermits, the superstar 1960s
English pop group, now is host of ``My Generation,'' dedicated to
the music that people his age grew up with.
   It's a half-hour show on cable television's VH-1.
   Noone, who turned 42 today, shows film clips of bands of the
1960s and '70s.
   ``When I was 14, I used to read the ages of these people. They
were 26 and 27. I thought, `These people are too old to be in rock
'n' roll.' Now you see the Rolling Stones. These guys are ancient
and they're good. I guess that's experience.''
   He also interviews musicians of his vintage on the show. But not
with the studio-formality of desk and chairs. Instead, he hits the
road with his minicam.
   ``When I go to rock 'n' roll shows,'' he says, ``I take the
camera with me. With most people I can walk up and say, `Will you
do this bit for my TV show?'''
   His interest in interviewing stars dates from his own days as a
fledgling star.
   ``When I was 16, I met Elvis Presley and interviewed him,'' he
says. ``That's going to be on the show. I met Colonel Parker in
Honolulu and said I wanted to interview Elvis, `because I'm the
biggest star in the world after him.' I said, `We're playing the
Hula Bowl tonight.' He asked how many tickets we sold. I said,
`100,000.' He said, `You can interview him.'
   ``It's a short interview, but it's nice.''
   Four different shows are seen each week. Each usually is
repeated later the same evening.
   Noone usually features bands that had many hits instead of just
one _ ``unless it's one I like.'' An example of the latter is the
Easybeats' ``Friday on my Mind,'' which Noone calls ``a great
working-class song.''
   Minimovie videos of hit singles postdate the ``My Generation''
era but Noone says there are plenty of TV clips and home movies and
more turn up all the time.
   On the show he sometimes tells anecdotes about the music stars
he knew in the 1960s. He also knew some of their families. ``Keith
Richards' father was a fat, jolly man. I knew John Lennon's father
better than I knew John. He was a great raconteur. George
Harrison's sister went to school with my sister.''
   Herman's Hermits, formed in 1962, first came to America in 1964.
It had its biggest year in 1965 and broke up in 1971. Its
best-remembered hits are ``Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely
Daughter,'' ``I'm Henry the Eighth I Am'' and ``There's a Kind of
Hush.''
   Noone didn't leave show business after the demise of Herman's
Hermits. He sang solo. In 1982, he was the fourth singer to play
Frederic in ``The Pirates of Penzance'' on Broadway. Early this
year, Cypress Records released ``I'm Into Something Good,'' Noone's
remake of Herman's Hermits' first hit, for the movie ``The Naked
Gun.''
   Noone still travels, with a New York-based band.
   ``We've rehearsed 100 songs, from the '60s, '70s and '80s,'' he
says. ``If they call for `Ferry Across the Mersey,' which was Gerry
and the Pacemakers' hit, we do it, of course. We play anything.''
   He even does an imitation of Johnny Cash singing ``Pinball
Wizard'' (from the Who's rock opera ``Tommy''). ``I think the
audience needs a laugh sometimes.''
   Noone is from a Liverpool family. He and an older sister grew up
in Manchester, living with their grandmother while their father,
who got out of the Royal Air Force in 1947, went back to college.
``My youngest brother is 17. There are just five of us but we're
all spread out.''
   When a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Herman's Hermits'
first American tour was held in New York recently, Noone's
3-year-old daughter thought it must be Daddy's birthday and asked
where his cake was.
   Married 21 years, Noone and his wife live in Santa Barbara,
Calif.
   Another current project of Noone's is producing a record for the
English group Johnny Hates Jazz. ``The leader is the son of Mickie
Most, the producer who made Herman's Hermits records,'' he says.
``We'd be in the studio and he'd say, `This song isn't working out.
Let's go out and have a beer.' We'd come back and it would usually
work.''

   The blonde pigtails have been gone for more than
30 years, replaced today by what looks like a modified Farrah
Fawcett cut, but Patty McCormack still has that impish, almost
wicked smile theatergoers remember from ``The Bad Seed.''
   She has done other things, but McCormack will be identified
forever with that horror classic in which she played Rhoda Penmark,
a sweet, polite, 8-year-old murderer. The Maxwell Anderson drama
was a hit on Broadway in 1954 and two years later became a
successful movie for which McCormack received an Academy Award
nomination.
   ``It's so hard when you do something that's noticed so much,
especially if you continue to work,'' the 44-year-old actress says
now. ``You can have credits up to here, but not everybody knows
them. The one people focus on is the one that got the notoriety.''
   But there was life after little Rhoda _ a marriage, two
children, movies, a short-lived TV series, guest shots on numerous
other television shows and stage appearances, mostly on the West
Coast. Now McCormack has begun a national tour in ``Rumors,'' the
Neil Simon comedy smash that will take her across the country
during the next nine months.
   Rehearsals for the tour brought her back to a New York theater
for the first time since ``The Bad Seed'' and triggered memories of
her days here as a child actress.
   ``Growing up, I always played people who had a peculiar side to
them,'' she says. ``I never did Sandra Dee roles. I always looked
like something else was going on.
   ``So much of the work we did back then on television was
theater-like. Even the procedure. We had three weeks' rehearsal.
And we tried things and threw them out if they didn't work. Not
like television today. You don't rehearse.''
   McCormack's career began in the early '50s in New York when her
mother, a former professional roller skater, carted her off to
auditions.
   ``Things just seemed to happen. I had a terrible lisp, and my
mother took me to this woman to correct it,'' she recalls. ``And
the woman had show business connections.''
   It led to her first Broadway show, ``Touchstone,'' with Ossie
Davis, which ran for one week. The following year, she was a star
in ``The Bad Seed.''
   ``I had the same growing difficulties that anybody had. People
would say about me, `You're such a normal kid.' And of course I
wasn't. But I kept thinking, `I am a normal kid. I am a normal
kid.' And that's confusing.
   ``I did what I did purely as a kid, because kids are almost
natural actors. But then as life goes on, you try to be this for
that person and that for this person, and you kind of get lost in
the shuffle. And I think I did. I'm coming to terms with that now.''
   The film version of ``The Bad Seed'' brought a nearly teen-age
McCormack to Hollywood where she did movies like ``Kathy-O'' and
her own television series called ``Peck's Bad Girl.''
   ``At 16, my interest in show business dropped,'' says the
daughter of a New York firefighter. ``I was confused: `What do I
really want to be?' Of course, we still ask that, but we don't tell
anyone.
   ``Kid actors have a hard time in life. Maybe it's because you
don't know who to be.
   ``I moved back to New York. I went to New Utrecht High School in
Brooklyn. I worked real hard at being anonymous. I even took back
my real name, which is Patty Russo.''
   From the time she was 18 to 21, McCormack abandoned acting. She
went to beauty school, sang with a rock 'n' roll band (Mikey Vee
and the Imperials) and worked in a talent agency for child models.
   ``I traveled into the city like I played another part. I was
trying things. I had a real job,'' McCormack says.
   Then she started to miss show business. At age 21, she went back
to Los Angeles and slowly began working again. She got married in
1967 and had two children, Bobby and Danielle.
   ``I had this fantasy about being the perfect mommy, but then my
marriage didn't last,'' she recalls. ``So half the characters were
gone. Work again became important to me.''
   For a while during her career, most prominently when she was in
the ABC television series ``The Ropers,'' McCormack changed her
professional name to Patricia McCormack.
   ``I thought if I was called `Patricia,' I would stand up taller
and feel like the woman I didn't feel like,'' she says. ``And of
course, it didn't help at all. Then I thought, `Well, this is
absurd. A name does not do it for you.' Plus I was with someone at
that time who liked it. I was influenced by what he thought. But it
didn't change anything.''
   Today, McCormack again thinks of herself as a working actress.
   She works regularly on television, having just completed an
episode of the syndicated series ``Freddy's Nightmares.'' In it,
she gets her eyes gouged out.
   ``It was fun,'' she giggles. ``I guess I still have a bizarre
sense of humor.
   ``Before I got married and had my kids, I did a tour of another
Neil Simon play, `Barefoot in the Park,''' McCormack says. ``It was
the first play I had done since `The Bad Seed' and that was
frightening. But I fell right into it.''

   Grim-faced, the teen-age boys squatted
around a Kurdish guerrilla showing them how to strip and assemble a
machine gun. Soon, they would be using the weapon in a conflict
that is almost 70 years old _ the Kurds' fight for an independent
homeland in Iran.
   The Iraqi-backed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran has in recent
weeks stepped up its attacks on Iranian military bases and economic
targets.
   Guerrilla chieftains at the KDP base camp here in the Iraqi
mountains said the youngsters will go into action, as their fathers
and grandfathers have before them, in the mountains of northwestern
Iran.
   ``They get three months' training in weapons, explosives and
guerrilla tactics, then join units inside Iran to carry out
hit-and-run attacks,'' said the camp commander, who would identify
himself only as Salam.
   It is a war that has largely been overshadowed by Kurdish
campaigns in neighboring Turkey and in Iraq itself. In southeastern
Turkey, the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party has been fighting a
guerrilla war for five years to establish a separate Marxist state.
   About 20 million Kurds _ Sunni Moslems of Aryan stock _ live in
an overlapping area where the borders of Soviet Armenia, Iran,
Iraq, Syria and Turkey converge, a region once known as Kurdistan.
   Iraq, Iran and Turkey all have faced rebellions by their Kurdish
minorities. But Iraq is nonetheless backing the Iranian Kurds in an
extension of its decades-old rivalry with Iran.
   Iran backed Iraqi Kurds in their war against the government in
Baghdad during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. Syria aids Kurdish
fighters in Turkey.
   The KDP fighters, clearly with Iraqi consent, stepped up their
attacks after their veteran leader, Abdul-Rahman Qassemlou, was
assassinated July 13 in Vienna, Austria.
   His successor, Sa'eed Badal, said Qassemlou went to Vienna in
response to an offer from Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani to
negotiate an end to the Kurdish rebellion.
   Badal said he believes Qassemlou was killed by agents of radical
Iranian factions in an attempt to torpedo Rafsanjani's efforts to
end the mountain war, a move that would have strengthened his
credibility as a pragmatist.
   Sa'eed said the KDP has turned down an Iranian proposal to
resume negotiations because ``we no longer trust them.''
   The guerrillas, known as Peshmergas, or ``those who face
death,'' say hundreds of young Iranian Kurds have joined them in
recent months.
   Kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claim
they are pinning down some 200,000 Iranians. Diplomatic sources in
Baghdad estimated that as many as 2,500 KDP guerrillas are in Iraq,
with thousands more operating inside Iran.
   ``Everybody in my village said the Peshmergas are working for a
better future for the Kurdish nation, so I decided to join them,''
said Farouk Hassan Pour, 14, who trekked across the mountains for
seven days until the guerrillas found him.
   About 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in this
camp high in the northern Iraqi mountains overlooking the Iranian
border.
   In the camp are about 1,000 guerrillas, dressed in their
distinctive baggy trousers and turbans. Several thousand Kurdish
women and children live in villages in the surrounding valleys.
   The KDP runs the camp, but the area is under Iraqi military
control. The guerrillas are not allowed to leave without Iraqi
permission.
   The Kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in the
lush uplands. The Iraqis provide flour, rice and fuel oil.
   A rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp for
guerrillas who have lost limbs. Among the 30 undergoing therapy is
Ismail Muradi, 23, who lost an arm in a recent raid.
   ``I don't care if I have to live in this camp, deprived of the
good things of life, for 50 years, so long as the next generation
of Kurds can live as free human beings,'' said Muradi, who joined
the guerrillas last year.
   A five-member French medical team from two relief agencies,
Medecins Sans Frontieres and International Medical Aid, operates a
makeshift hospital in the base. The team alternates with others who
spend three-month tours in the mountains.
   ``Conditions are pretty primitive,'' said Dr. Jean Breveau, a
surgeon from Paris who is on his third tour. ``We've eliminated
serious diseases, but there's a lot of malnutrition and back pains,
which are common among mountain people.''
   Breveau, who also has worked in Africa and with Tamil rebels in
Sri Lanka off southern India, said he misses life in Paris and his
family.
   ``But these people need my help more than the people of Paris,''
he said. ``There's a great satisfaction when you save someone who
would have died if there had been no surgeon.''
   The Kurds were promised an independent state in the Treaty of
Sevres of 1920. But the great powers sliced up Kurdistan among
Iran, Iraq and Turkey.
   Since then, the Kurds have been in a constant state of revolt
against one or more of these states. The Kurdish revolt in Persia,
which later became known as Iran, began in 1920.
   Kurdish hopes of self-rule have been hampered by internal
rivalries that have prevented a unified strategy.
   Nonetheless, morale among the Iranian Kurds in Iraq appears high.
   Qader Agha Ibrahimi, an 83-year-old former Iranian army officer,
joined the rebels 43 years ago when the Soviets seized part of
northern Iran in 1945 and set up the short-lived Kurdish Mahabad
republic.
   It lasted only about a year before the Iranians reclaimed the
territory. It's the closest the Kurds anywhere have ever come to
having an independent state.
   ``I've spent half my life fighting for freedom and Kurdistan,''
said Ibrahimi, now frail and going deaf. ``They've been hard,
difficult years. But I still believe that one day we will win.''
   One of his sons was killed fighting the Iranians. Three others
are in Iran.
   ``I've never laid down my gun,'' the grizzled old warrior said,
patting his AK-47 assault rifle.

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old war between Marxist Kurdish
guerrillas and security forces is driving thousands of Kurdish
civilians from their villages in southeastern Turkey to safer areas.
   Of 2,000 people killed so far in the conflict, at least 700 have
been listed as Kurdish farmers.
   Guerrillas of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party are fighting to
establish an independent Marxist state in the Kurdish areas in
eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   The scope of the support they have from Kurdish civilians could
not be independently determined but Kurdish resentment toward
Turkish security forces has been building. It reached a high poiint
in mid-September when a crowd clashed with police in the township
of Silopi while protesting the killing of six Kurds a few days
earlier.
   The security forces maintained the victims were guerrillas, but
local residents claimed they were farmers taking fruit to the town
market. The locals charged the victims were shot as suspected
rebels.
   An investigating group from Turkey's Parliament bore them out.
   ``It is very sad but the people are right,'' said Nurettin
Yilmaz, a member of Parliament from Premier Turgut Ozal's
Motherland Party. ``Our investigation in the town and taped
testimony of many witnesses support their claim.''
   Yilmaz and two other Parliament members have urged the
prosecution of those responsible.
   For years, the local Kurds have complained that if they don't
help the guerrillas, they risk being killed by them. If they do
help them, they face imprisonment by the security forces and
sometimes torture.
   Security officials contend it is difficult to distinguish the
guerrillas from the farmers and herdsmen of the 300 small hamlets
in the region.
   Some officials acknowledge that local support for the guerrillas
is increasing, mainly out of fear and in some cases because of
mistreatment by government forces.
   Residents complain most about the special anti-terrorist police
in the southeastern area, the Parliament group said.
   ``Maybe it is because of their commando training but they are
very harsh with the local people,'' Yilmaz said.
   ``The people are increasingly becoming alienated from the state.
There is cause for anxiety,'' said Fuat Atalay, a Social Democrat
from Diyarbakir, the largest province in the area.
   During a recent parliamentary debate, Interior Minister
Abdulkadir Aksu said that only those suspected of aiding and
harboring guerrillas were detained.
   He contended that police and soldiers were trying to save lives
in an area where he said the guerrillas had killed 618 civilians
and 336 security personnel in the past two years.
   However, the aspirations and grievances of the Kurdish minority,
a taboo subject in Turkey until recent years, now find expression
even in parliamentary debates in Ankara.
   Members from the Kurdish areas are demanding increased
government investment in the Kurdish provinces, where the jobless
rate of 35 percent is double the national average.
   The Kurds also are demanding that the education, publications
and broadcasts in the Kurdish language _ now forbidden _ be allowed.
   ``Like ostrichs burying their heads in the sand, we are still
debating, in this day and age, whether there are Kurds in Turkey,''
said Yilmaz.

   This is one of a series of periodic reports
looking ahead to Western Europe in 1992, when the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community remove their trade barriers and
interlock their economies, policies and goals.

   Belgians jokingly call a morning train that
pulls out of Brussels with mostly middle-class passengers to nearby
Luxembourg ``Le Train des Fraudeurs'' _ The Cheaters' Train.
   The nickname stems from the financial business assumed to be
carried on by the train's passengers in Luxembourg, which has long
lured investors because of its strict banking secrecy and tax
breaks.
   But the country, which is smaller than Rhode Island and
overshadowed by neighboring Belgium, France and West Germany, has
been honing other financial skills to compete in the single market
that will be created in late 1992 when the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community take down old trade barriers that
restrict the free movement of people, money, goods and services.
   Local officials appear to want to shed Luxembourg's image as a
savings and tax haven. Several interviewed played down the
importance of the country's secrecy and tax provisions.
   Whatever, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a country of just
372,000 people (about the same as Cincinnati, Ohio), clearly has
appeal.
   Luxembourg now has 156 banks _ only a handful American _ many of
which are on Boulevard Royal, known as Luxembourg's Wall Street.
   About 650 investment funds and some 100 reinsurance companies
also operate from here. The stock market trades some 8,400 issues,
about 75 percent of which are bonds denominated in dollars or major
European currencies.
   In an interview, Prime Minister Jacques Santer expressed
satisfaction with the financial center.
   ``(It) has not only grown but has also ... developed its own
specificity and is now competitive with all other, bigger
centers,'' he said in his office at government house.
   The center was hurt by the banking crisis in the early 1980s
when major developing countries were unable to meet their foreign
debt payments.
   But it has since rebounded and the outlook remains bright,
according to analysts.
   Among the advantages they cite are the country's social and
political stability, central location in the European Economic
Community, strong government support and multilingual population.
It also has no central bank to apply credit controls or reserve
requirements on banks as a means of shaping monetary policy.
   Moreover, a recent report from the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, a group of 24 industrialized nations,
remarked on the country's pluses:
   ``One of the special attractions of the Luxembourg financial
market from a tax standpoint is that there is no withholding tax on
dividend or interest payments for non-residents and that
stockmarket transactions are not taxed.
   ``Here too, changes in the taxation system _ corporation tax
reduced from 40 to 34 percent between 1987 and 1989, the abolition
of stamp duty on securities issues _ mean that the Grand Duchy now
ranks as one of the world's most attractive financial markets.''
   Still another advantage, it said, was a decision this year to
spell out the right to banking secrecy in relation to tax
authorities. Disclosure of information about customers' bank
accounts is prohibited, except in criminal cases.
   Moves to strengthen the financial center will no doubt help
Luxembourg compete in the 1992 market that will be formed when the
EEC lifts the trade barriers.
   The EEC already has approved measures requiring the lifting of
controls on the movement of capital _ or money _ by July 1.
   France and Italy, which still have some restrictions on foreign
bank accounts held by their citizens, intend to comply, possibly
before that date. Less-advanced member nations _ Portugal, Spain,
Ireland and Greece _ have more time to do so.
   The OECD report cautions that the single market drive ``means
that Luxembourg will almost certainly have to adjust again to
changes in the international financial environment.''
   It warns about moves to impose a European-wide withholding tax
on interest income.
   The European Commission, the EEC's executive body, unveiled a
plan earlier this year for a minimum withholding rate of 15 percent
throughout the trading bloc. It was later scaled down to 10 percent.

   The proposal, requiring unanimous approval, was fought by
Luxembourg and other countries.
   ``I think at this point it is a dead issue,'' said Prime
Minister Santer.
   In pushing the measure, the commission argued it was needed to
halt tax evasion once capital controls were lifted.
   ``There is thus a risk that, once investors are free to open
bank accounts in other member states, they will not declare their
interest income to their national tax authorities and will thus
illegally evade payment of tax,'' it said.
   That might lead, it added, to a substantial loss of revenue in
many countries.
   West German authorities introduced a 10 percent withholding tax
at the start of the year, only to repeal it in the summer. Analysts
believe a substantial amount of money flowed out of the country,
some into Luxembourg.
   Most analysts do not expect much to happen on July 1 since many
capital controls already have been lifted.
   James Cornish, European markets strategist at County NatWest in
London, noted, however, ``In principle, if there's a lot of money
pent up in Italy by the restrictions, the money could flow out.''
   Fresh from apparent victory on the withholding front,
Luxembourgers shrug off suggestions they might be hurt by greater
competition from other money centers.
   ``We've always had open frontiers,'' said Fernand Rau, managing
director of Credit European, a subsidiary of a Belgian bank, and
head of the national legislature's finance committee.
   ``We are probably the country least concerned among all the 12
with the lifting of (capital) controls in 1990,'' he said.
   Jean Krier, senior executive vice president of the Banque
International of Luxembourg and president of the Luxembourg
Association of Banks and Bankers, agreed: ``Luxembourg has certain
advantages which cannot disappear.''
   The nation's bankers must be innovative to keep pace, Santer
said.
   ``The bigger the capital markets where a banking center can
operate, (the) more opportunities there are _ of course, the more
competition there is,'' said Pierre Jaans, general director of the
Luxembourg Monetary Institute.
   Officials believe some banks want to move to Luxembourg before
the 1992 deadline for the European-wide market.
   The number of banks has grown from 112 in June 1984 to 156 now.
Officials expect it to reach 160 by year's end.
   The majority of the banks have European parents, with West
Germans topping the list at 37 banks as of June.
   Banks with Luxembourg or Belgian roots reached 19, and 13 were
counted as Swiss. Only nine were American, the same as Japanese.
   Luxembourgers bridle at questions about dirty money operations,
often attracted to banking centers steeped in secrecy.
   The legislature recently enacted a measure setting tough
penalties for the laundering of drug money.
   ``We have no interest ... to have this reputation, and therefore
we are very strongly against this situation,'' Santer said.
   Agreed Jaans, ``Since we are so small ... we have to be
particularly cautious.''
   The United States last year accused a bank owned by a Luxembourg
holding company of taking part in an international ring that
laundered millions of dollars in profits for the Colombian cocaine
trade. The bank denied the charges.

<TEXT>
   Ireland's economy is surging ahead, but
it's a long, long way to full employment.
   Inflation is down to a modest 4 percent and economic growth is
expected to surpass 5 percent next year. Exports are projected to
reach an all-time high of $19.3 billion this year with a trade
surplus of nearly $700 million.
   Unemployment has decreased from 19.7 percent in January 1987,
but only to 17.3 percent, and the rate of emigration has climbed.
   Ireland is enjoying ``a very strong recovery from a fairly
dismal period of no growth,'' says John Fitz Gerald, a senior
researcher at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
   The indicators have improved just since summer, Fitz Gerald
said, and the institute has revised its economic growth forecast
for this year upward by a full percentage point.
   The institute forecasts that growth will stay above 4 percent a
year through 1993, inflation will remain low and the government can
expect budget surpluses by 1992.
   ``There are few economies in the industrialized world now in a
position to make the kind of optimistic projections we can, or to
point to such an improvement in such a short space of time,'' Prime
Minister Charles Haughey said recently.
   ``The emphasis now must be on translating rising economic growth
into more jobs,'' he added.
   While the unemployment rate has declined in the past two years,
it still is nearly double the average of 9.3 percent in the
12-nation European Economic Community, of which Ireland is a
member. Only Spain, at 17.4 percent, reported worse.
   ``There are fewer people with jobs in Ireland than there were in
1950,'' says the Rev. Sean Healy of the Justice Office of the Roman
Catholic Conference of Major Religious Superiors.
   As the number of jobless more than doubled in the 1980s, the
economic institute reported, the standard of living for the
unemployed declined. That decline, it added, may continue despite
the upward trend of the economic indicators.
   Emigration, a signal of Irish distress since the famine days of
the 19th century, is on the rise again. The government's Central
Statistics Office reported that 46,000 people left in the 12 months
through last April, up from 32,000 the year before.
   A recent report based on the 1986 census found that net
migration from Ireland between 1981 and 1986 totaled 72,000 _
two-thirds of them 15 to 24 years old.
   The economic institute's survey predicted that Ireland will add
82,000 jobs and cut emigration to 11,000 by 1994. Unemployment is
projected to drop to 12.7 percent.
   Ireland bailed itself out of deep deficits by slashing public
spending, supported by a broad, informal coalition of the
politically dominant parties of the right.
   When Haughey called an election this past summer, however, his
Fianna Fail party found the voters unhappy about austerity,
especially cuts in the health service. Fianna Fail lost seats and
Haughey clung to power by forming a coalition, a deeply unpopular
move within his own ranks, with a splinter party.
   Fianna Fail, Ireland's dominant party since the 1930s, no longer
pursues the dream of a Gaelic-speaking, mostly rural and united
island espoused by Eamon de Valera, the party founder and former
prime minister and president.
   Like other mainstream parties, it aspires to a united Ireland.
Indeed, that goal still features prominently in the constitution
drawn up by de Valera. But under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
Ireland has accepted that Northern Ireland can only become part of
Ireland when a majority of the British province's people want to.
   In its seventh decade of independence from Britain, this nation
of 3.6 million people is still remarkably dependent on the British
economy, which absorbs 30 percent of Ireland's exports and the
largest portion of Irish emigres.
   In economic terms, the people of the Republic of Ireland have
reason to envy the life in Northern Ireland. A married couple in
Dublin earning 25,000 Irish pounds pays 9,625 pounds in tax, while
a couple in Belfast earning 25,000 British pounds pays 5,467 pounds
in income tax.
   The cost of living in Dublin, excluding rent, matches London,
though wages are 27 percent lower, according to a 1988 survey by
the Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Making a virtue of adversity, the government's Industrial
Development Authority is promoting Ireland as a low-cost base
within the European Economic Community, whose members are to
abolish internal tariff barriers by the end of 1992 and create a
single market of 320 million people.
   Labor costs in Ireland averaged about $10 an hour in 1988,
compared with $11.21 in Britain and $18.38 in West Germany, the
development authority says.
   Fitz Gerald says improvements in employment are restrained by a
baby boom now working its way through the schools. The children
from the peak of that boom are now 9 years old and will be entering
the job market within a decade.
   Though the constitution no longer grants a special role to the
Roman Catholic Church, Ireland remains 93 percent Catholic and
divorce and abortion are illegal.
   Even though the birth rate has fallen by more than 25 percent
from 1980 to 1987, it remains the highest in the European Economic
Community, at 16.6 per 1,000.
   Michael Barry, senior lecturer at the National College of
Industrial Relations in Dublin, says that unless Ireland reduces
its population growth, it risks becoming ``a permanent low-wage
economy and a backwater and peripheral slum region of the new,
enlarged Europe.''
   He does not believe Ireland can ever support all its people, at
current rates of growth.
   ``With the industrial development policy, with its very best
efforts to attract foreign companies, they have only managed to
replace jobs _ low-wage jobs with high-wage jobs,'' Barry said in
an interview.

   The ladder of ambition for some of the
young men in old Dublin begins with breaking a car window, then
stealing what's inside the car, then stealing a whole car.
   Then they burn it, without stripping a few saleable parts.
   ``They don't think that far,'' says Gus Monaghan, who works with
young school dropouts in the rough and ready streets of the
Liberties, hoping to steer them away from a life of breaking into
cars.
   The neighborhood where Jonathan Swift wrote ``Gulliver's
Travels'' and George Frideric Handel premiered his ``Messiah'' can
be described today by what it lacks: parks, jobs and, for many, a
future.
   At a school established by the South Inner City Commmunity
Development Association, Monaghan starts with the basics, teaching
often unruly young school dropouts how to iron a shirt, cook a meal
or do simple carpentry.
   ``These young people have never been asked to accept the
consequences of their own actions,'' says David Orr, the school's
director.
   They and their neighbors are quite unprepared for any economic
miracles that may occur, Orr added.
   ``If Toyota walked in here and created 2,000 jobs, there would
be no one here to take them,'' he said.
   The Liberties, so called because it is outside the medieval city
walls, stands apart from an Irish economy that is generating record
trade surpluses and strong economic growth of 5 percent this year.
   That fortunate Dublin is seen on Grafton Street, where Ralph
Lauren and Laura Ashley set the marketing tone, but not on Meath
Street, the gritty strip in the Liberties where the inner city
assocation has its offices.
   ``It's a different world really,'' says Roisin Elliott, whose
work at the association includes counseling frightened people in
debt to loan sharks.
   Employment at the Guinness brewery, the neighborhood's biggest
industry, has dropped from 4,000 jobs two decades ago to 1,400.
   Liam Fenlon, who is chairman of the association's board, says
the group has put 175 young people to work _ ``people who normally
never ever got work, three-fourths of whom, I have no hesitation in
saying, would end up in jail.''
   The school's courses include woodworking, sewing and
photography, and it is placing 60 percent or more of its graduates
in fulltime jobs, he says.
   Three students have been studying German and will go to West
Germany for three months' work experience.
   ``If I get a job I'll stay, because there is nothing here,''
says Jinet McGuinness, 17, who left school three years ago.
   Glen Duggan, 17, also bound for Germany, joined the training
program a year after being expelled from school _ for throwing
chairs, he explains. Then he drifted on the streets.
   Stephen Domican, 16, is learning carpentry and wants to stay in
Dublin but says the neighborhood needs ``more houses, more jobs,
more construction.''
   Others cannot wait to leave.
   ``I'd go now but you're not allowed,'' said Audrey Langley, 15.
   ``I'd hate leaving my family and friends and where you grew up
and all,'' she added. ``Still, they can't expect you stay here and
live on the dole for the rest of your life.''
   Poverty is an ancient presence in the Liberties.
   Jonathan Swift, the dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, raged at
Ireland's deprivation and in 1729 offered ``A Modest Proposal for
Preventing the Children of Ireland from being a Burden to their
Parents or Country.'' In that famous satire, his modest proposal
was to eat the young.
   Swift's grave in St. Patrick's Cathedral is a highlight of a
Liberties tour developed by the inner city association to create
four part-time jobs.
   Margaret Doyle always points out the banners of the Order of St.
Patrick in the cathedral and retells the story, possibly
apocryphal, of how prospective members demonstrated aristocratic
credentials.
   ``You had to prove that your family hadn't worked in 200
years,'' she said. ``We'll all qualify for it soon.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Crimes and Misdemeanors'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For a decade now, Woody Allen has maintained a schizoid quality
in his films. With ``Broadway Danny Rose,'' ``The Purple Rose of
Cairo'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' he has presented the
familiar Woody Allen, the heroically neurotic chronicler of the
absurdities of urban living.
   ``Interiors,'' ``September'' and ``Another Woman,'' which Allen
wrote and directed but in which he did not appear, reflected darker
images derived from his idol, Ingmar Bergman.
   Now the twain meet in ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Like all of
Allen's movies, it is idiosyncratic, highly original and
thought-provoking. But it is unexpectedly cynical.
   Two parallel but rarely converging plots deal with different
segments of Manhattan society. One is show biz. Allen is a failed
documentary maker whose devotion to esoteric subjects precludes his
success. His despairing wife, Jenny Gleason, wangles him a real
job: profiling her brother, Alan Alda, a high-powered television
producer. Allen is repelled by the crassly commercial Alda but
intrigued by his aide, Mia Farrow.
   The other plot begins with a testimonial dinner extolling the
good works of Martin Landau, a rich ophthalmologist and benefactor
with a loving wife, Claire Bloom, and family. But for two years,
Landau has had a fatal attraction to Anjelica Huston.
   When his mistress grows impatient with unkept promises, Landau
fears his comfortable world will collapse. He finds a solution
through his black-sheep brother with Mob connections, Jerry Orbach.
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' climaxes at a wedding, where most of
the cast converge. There is an epilogue in which Landau returns to
his normal, untroubled life.
   Despite the murky message, the film can be enjoyed on more than
one level. Allen's dialogue is lucid and insightful, and his
skewering of television's idiocies hits the target.
   Actors always seem to do their best work for Allen. Landau's
portrait of a good man susceptible to evil is brilliant. Alda
captures all the shrewdness and pomposity of the television breed.
Sam Waterston helps bridge the two plots as a rabbi going blind.
   The Orion release was produced by Robert Greenhut and
photographed by Bergman's favorite Sven Nykvist. Rating: PG-13 for
adult subject matter. Running time: 104 minutes.

   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (MCA Home Video. VHS, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   When film students, critics, historians and other buffs are
asked to list the best movies ever made, ``Lawrence of Arabia''
appears with well-deserved frequency. This majestic epic is
cinematic poetry.
   When the David Lean masterpiece, which introduced an unknown
actor named Peter O'Toole, landed in New York on Dec. 17, 1962, it
opened with a few lovely touches including a program book complete
with bibliographical and biographical material. Although called a
``camel opera'' by some wags, and homoerotic by others because of
its absence of women and glorification of men with men, few could
elude the movie's raptures.
   And the charms and cinematic seductions of ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' still hold up on the small screen, despite the thick black
frame that allows Cinemascope to be reduced.
   What's being offered on video is a new, restored version of the
film, which played theatrically earlier this year.
   After a decade, 32 minutes of the movie had been cut and one
print contained a complete reversal (Lawrence's watch is switched
from hand to hand). There were also original editing cuts made when
the movie was first released to trim it for American audiences with
a short attention span. Lean has restored some of those scenes, at
times calling some of his actors (notably O'Toole) into a studio to
record new dialogue.
   Lean has added a scene in which Lawrence rudely breaks up a
snooker game at the officers' club and a harem scene. The flogging
scene before a panting bey (Jose Ferrer) is more fully developed
and suggests even more strongly the sexual connotations.
   The restoration by Robert A. Harris and Anne Coates, who won an
Academy Award for editing the original movie, takes the film to a
running time of 218 minutes. The new version, with an added 20
minutes, is still breathtaking but attempts to more deeply probe
the elusive and enigmatic Lawrence.
   T.E. Lawrence was an arrogant cartographer in the British army
who is sent to Arabia to assist Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) in
the 1917-18 Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. He quickly
adapts to the desert and the Bedouin way of life _ he drinks water
only when his guide does; he eats the same tepid swill as they do.
He also becomes a messianic warrior whose strategy and wisdom are
matched only by ego and obsession.
   With his almost virginal white robes, O'Toole, with eyes the
deep blue of the Mediterranean and hair the color of golden straw,
struts about not with the swagger of the British gentleman but with
the stance of a god. Indeed, the exploits Robert Bolt so craftily
chisels in his excellent screenplay, paint Lawrence as a demigod.
   Unlike many of today's filmmakers who take their audiences to be
simpletons, Lean has a keen eye for detail and strives for cultural
accuracy. The costumes, props, blocking all hold up today _
``Lawrence of Arabia'' could have been made in the 1980s. The
makeup, however, especially the shoe polish on Guinness, is dated.
   The performances by a rash of stars who also include Omar Sharif
in his Western screen debut and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. But
the movie's real star is the desert with its smouldering dunes and
poetry of colors.

   ``Miss Firecracker'' (HBO Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.99. Rated
PG-13)
   
   How much can one hope for in life? Not much, but that still
leaves a lot of room. And as we learn in Thomas Schlamme's ``Miss
Firecracker,'' anything is possible.
   The key is to just be oneself, and to honestly approach and
embrace the opportunities in life. Beth Henley's story drops enough
homilies between the lines to stuff a goosefeather-filled quilt.
But these wise little nuggets are drizzled with spice and wit and
charm.
   Carnelle Scott (Holly Hunter), a plain little thing who cleans
fish in a catfish factory, has spent her life in the shadow of her
beautiful cousin, Elain, a delicate but catty magnolia blossom who
won the Miss Firecracker beauty contest in 1972.
   Carnelle, who's known in town as Miss Hot Tamale because of her
lusty ways, has held only one dream in life: to win the pageant. So
when she reachs the cutoff age, she dies her hair a brassy,
fire-engine red, and enters.
   Her main support is a young woman who is equally plain _ an
endearing seamstress with the improbable name of Popeye (Alfre
Woodard), who taught herself to sew by making little outfits for
her pet frogs as a child. Popeye, whose brother threw gravel in her
eyes when she was a child and then tried to ease the pain with
eardrops, hears through her eyes and sees beyond the surface of
things in life. She dreams of one day finding that one special love.
   Elain (Mary Steenburgen) returns to Yazoo City for the contest
to give a speech, ``My Life as a Beauty.'' Her wild brother,
Delmount (Tim Robbins), has just been released from an insane
asylum after Elain committed him for what she saw as his
anti-social ways. After a brief stint removing squished animals
from highways, he arrives in Yazoo City to sell the family home.
   It all comes together on the runway. Selfishness is exposed like
an ugly boil; loyality, optimism and honesty glow.
   Henley, who received a Pulitzer Prize for ``Crimes of the
Heart'' in 1981, opened ``Miss Firecracker'' off-Broadway to rave
reviews in 1984. She wrote the screenplay for the movie version.
   In portraits bursting with the magic and eccentricities of the
same Southern literary tradition that gave us William Faulkner,
Harper Lee and Tennesee Williams, Henley has created memorable and
rich characters. These are real people, not Hollywood plastics.
   Hunter originated the role of Carnelle off-Broadway, and is
marvelously hyper as the unsophisticated, unassuming beauty
hopeful. Robbins is strangely maniacal but boyish and easy to love.
Steenburgen, who was born in Arkansas, plays magnolia blossom to
the hilt and is delicious. But it is Woodard who steals the movie
with her lovely innocence as Popeye. We know what love really means.
   Play this one for the entire family. The language might be a
little strong for younger children, but the values are even
stronger.

   The Uptown String Quartet (Philips) _ Diane Monroe and Lesa
Terry, violins; Maxine Roach, viola; Eileen M. Folson, Cello.
   
   And now for something completely different ...
   A listener needs a change now and again, and this disc from the
Uptown String Quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears.
   The name gives a clue _ a marriage of the string quartet with
the sounds from far uptown, beyond 110th Street in Manhattan. A big
shot of jazz, a little rag, a little blues, a lot of Polish.
   Listen to ``Midnight Child'' and it's evident why the mix is so
convincing. The virtuoso note-bending of the blues and gospel
singers was born for the violin. So, too, were the strutting
rhythms of ``Calvary,'' and doggone if Scott Joplin didn't have
strings in mind when he wrote ``Easy Winners.''
   It helps, too, that the four players are demon fiddlers, whose
various experiences include the Philadelphia Orchestra,
``Dreamgirls,'' the New York Philharmonic, Frank Sinatra, Sammy
Davis Jr., Wynton Marsalis and producer Max Roach's Double Quartet.
   Yes, it may seem a little strange, but this is no Beethoven's
Ninth for massed accordion band kind of stunt. Each of a dozen cuts
is perfectly idiomatic, fresh, piquant, just right.
   The Uptown String Quartet threatens to give crossover recordings
a good name.

   ``Trash'' (Epic) _ Alice Cooper
   
   Don Henley recently complained that pop music has become
moronic, which would mean that Alice Cooper was way ahead of his
time.
   Happily, two decades after the release of his first record,
Cooper still sounds moronic. ``Trash,'' his latest album, is
impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike.
   Don't be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought Cooper
spits out over grinding guitars. These tunes are cartoons _ they
have more in common with Sam Kinnison than Judas Priest.
   No image is too obvious for Cooper, which is half the fun. And
he shows cleverness in other ways. ``I'll drive you like a hammer
on a bed of nails,'' Cooper sings. Then the punch line: ``Ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow.''
   The band is head-banger friendly. Guitarist John McCurry nicely
frames Cooper's frenzy, and guest appearances by Aerosmith and Jon
Bon Jovi add to the fun.
   There are some dead spots, but such hormonal imbalances as ``I'm
Your Gun'' and ``This Maniac's in Love With You'' make ``Trash''
the funniest heavy-metal record since Spinal Tap. Whether Cooper
intended it to be that way is really immaterial.

   Martin Friedman, who during 28 years as director of the Walker
Art Center in Minneapolis built the museum from a primarily
regional facility into a major national institution, has announced
his retirement, effective Nov. 1, 1990.
   Friedman, who has been associated with Walker for his entire
museum career, said he will turn 65 next year and it seemed time to
move on.
   A search committee has been formed to select a successor, said
Bruce Atwater, president of Walker's board.
   ``Martin Friedman's long and successful identification with the
Walker Art Center is well known throughout the art world, as well
as in this community,'' Atwater said. ``Thanks to his leadership,
the Walker Art Center is in excellent artistic and administrative
condition.''
   Friedman joined the Walker's staff as chief curator in 1958. He
served as Walker's acting director in 1960 and was named director
in 1961.

<HEAD>Eds: `The Bear' opened Oct. 27 in limited theaters.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   French filmmaker Jean-Jacques Annaud recently
talked about why he has spent the last 10 years making three highly
original films, ``Quest for Fire,'' ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``The Bear.''
   ``I always see audiences begging for something different,'' he
said. ``It's difficult to make something different today. Many
films have been made, and there are many good filmmakers around. To
bring something fresh to the screen is difficult, let's face it.
   ``This is what pushes me. It's so pleasant seeing people come
out of the cinema having the impression that they discovered
something new. They are happily surprised, and I think that's a
great reward.''
   ``The Bear'' is unquestionably different. Based on the old James
Oliver Curwood novel ``The Grizzly King,'' it tells the battles of
a small cub and a huge male bear against hunters and nature. The
film already has grossed more than $100 million in Europe.
   ``The large part of the battle is to explain to the public the
nature of this film. It's an entertainment. It's not documentary.
It's not the old-fashioned Disney animal picture. It's not a
wilderness picture,'' he said.
   ``When I tell people my last film is about two bears, they're
convinced it's for kids. It's not a National Geographic
(television) special. How can I explain to people that it is
something that they have not seen _ yet? Fortunately when I arrived
here, the Hollywood Reporter said it was similar to `E.T.' Thank
you.''
   Annaud's history with ``The Bear'' dates back to 1981, when he
had finished his prehistoric adventure, ``Quest for Fire.'' He fell
in love with Curwood's book, then was sidetracked by ``The Name of
the Rose.''
   ``The Bear'' was launched in 1986. Annaud, himself a bear of a
man with curly, graying hair and a charming accent, plunged himself
into the new project, exploring locations, checking out bear
trainers, steeping himself in animal behavior.
   ``The Bear'' was filmed in Europe's Dolomites from May 18, 1987,
to the following Sept. 21. The difficulties with animals, weather
and managing a 200-person crew were enormous, but Annaud was
exhilarated by his actors.
   ``Bears are very fascinating animals,'' he said. ``They are as
intelligent as dogs, but they have something dogs do not: They
spend a lot of their time standing up. Because of that, there is
immediate identification with human beings.
   ``Take a lion. A fascinating animal, but it remains a beast. A
bear is a beast in the four-leg version. Very hairy. Very noisy.
It's fascinating, he's so powerful. Suddenly, he stands up (Annaud
demonstrates, bearlike). The front legs look like arms. They use
their paws like arms. Their claws like fingers. If you see a bear
eat an apple, it's just like a human.''
   The two principals were played by Bart, a Baltimore Zoo grizzly
trained by Doug Seus of Utah, and Douce (``sweet''), a cub from a
French zoo. Were there days when the two stars simply didn't want
to act?
   ``Of course,'' said the director. ``Any star you work with has
bad days. Stars are very temperamental. So are bears. You cannot
push them. In any case, I would not advise a director to push a
star. A star must be happy in front of the camera _ especially when
they are bears and they can kill you if you're not.
   ``I swear that if you try to get something from an animal who is
not in a good mood, not only will you not get it that day, you will
never get it. What you have to do is organize the set so the animal
will be happy with its own instincts, digging in its own nature to
discover what it would do in such a circumstance. He would in
effect rewrite the script.''
   He cited the example of a scene in which the grizzly scratches
its back on a tree. The scene took days of preparation: finding a
tree with rough bark, laying a cement platform at the base and
covering it with moss, surrounding the tree with rocks, putting
sand on the bear's back so it would itch. A few seconds on the
screen, the scene took a day to shoot.
   ``My first concern with the film was that no animal would get
hurt,'' said Annaud. ``Second concern, although there is no Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Technicians nor Actors _ because
they're not endangered species _ I was very worried about working
every day with those enormous monsters.''
   He became more worried toward the end of shooting because no
incidents had occurred. One girl had tried to remove her finger
from the cub's mouth and nearly lost her finger when the cub bit
down. The only other casualty was Annaud himself. He ``foolishly''
posed for photographs with Bart in the cage. Like some stars in the
past, Bart turned on his director in a bad mood ``and decided to
kill me.''
   Annaud followed the safety instruction of playing dead when
menaced, and Bart retreated.
   A scene that amazes previewers comes when Bart roars at hunter
Tcheky Karyo at close range on a mountain ledge. It's the real
thing, the director assured. Bear and actor were a few feet apart,
but Karyo had the option of leaping to a net 30 feet below.
   ``The Bear'' credits list Jim Henson's Creature Shop as creators
of ``animatronic bears.'' But Annaud assured that the Henson fakes
were used only for battle scenes.
   ``Henson's contribution was to avoid putting the animals in any
situation where they were at risk,'' said Annaud. ``For instance, I
have a fight between bears and dogs. As long as there is no body
contact, there is a real bear. But when you see the dogs biting the
fur, you don't need a real bear. But the fur needs life in it, so
that was where Henson came in.'' The same with a fight between the
cub and a puma.
   His next project?
   ``I don't know. Even though `The Bear' is a success in Europe, I
want to see how it does here. My films have not been terribly
successful here. I hope that will change.''

   Chantal Kozyreff lives with one of a
museum's worst dilemmas: to exhibit a treasure is to see it slowly
fade into oblivion.
   To avoid such loss, Brussels' Museum of Art and History, where
Kozyreff heads the Far East department, has had to keep its 7,542
Japanese woodcut prints mostly under lock since it began collecting
them a century ago.
   To preserve the original coloring and sharpness of the 17th to
19th century prints, they have long been shielded from daylight _
and visitors _ in a cavernous room. There the collection remained,
unknown but to a few cognoscenti.
   For the Europalia-Japan art festival this fall, however,
Kozyreff has allowed 1,000 of the light-sensitive prints to go on a
unique display until December in the Beaux-Arts Palace of
Charleroi, 31 miles south of Brussels.
   ``Some of the prints have never been shown in public before and
some may never be shown again,'' said Kozyreff.
   The occasion has not been wasted on the critics, who got a
glimpse of the works of such masters as Katsushika Hokusai,
Toshusai Sharaku and Suzuki Harunobu, all exhuming a rare freshness
in hue.
   ``A universe of elegance of refinement,'' said the Gazet Van
Antwerpen newspaper, lauding the nature scenes, portraits of Kabuki
theater actors and glimpses of geishas.
   ``You just will not believe your eyes,'' praised De Standaard.
   The Brussels daily added that the Japanese prints show was the
best of 33 exhibits in the Europalia festival, which is expected to
draw more than 1.7 million visitors during its three-month run.
   Every fortnight, 200 different prints will be put under the
dimmed lights of the Beaux-Arts Palace. The rotation will limit
damage to the works. Light changes the pigments of the ink and
makes the old paper wither.
   ``If you show it permanently, it disappears,'' said Kozyreff.
Comparing it to a tree leaf in fall, she said, ``if you leave it in
the open, it will shrivel.
   ``Anyway, even looking at 200 stamps in one session is too much.
You can only concentrate on some 60 or it gets to be too much.''
   But one man who couldn't get enough was Edmond Michotte, a
Belgian businessman who a century ago had a huge appetite for all
things Japanese.
   When Japan broke out of its isolation in the latter part of the
19th century, Europe was stunned to discover such a rich artistic
culture. Soon the first woodcut prints arrived in Europe and were
enthusiastically received.
   Vincent Van Gogh was so impressed he made a series of paintings
of prints.
   Michotte managed to select the best woodcut prints before they
even came off the boats and had amassed a superb collection by the
turn of the century.
   In 1904 he wrote: ``The Japanese gave up the finest of their art
riches to foreigners. The products left for London and Paris by the
hundred thousands.''
   Because they were not unique pieces, Japan did not consider the
prints national treasures. Prints from one woodcut could range in
numbers from a few hundred to a couple of thousand, but only the
first few had a perfect sharpness.
   Soon the market was exhausted. Today the best woodcut prints are
limited to some 20 collections worldwide.
   Apart from Brussels, two of the best collections outside Japan
are in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and the Art Institute of
Chicago.
   The prints have now become so rare that a Sharaku recently
fetched $345,000 at an auction.
   In 1905, Michotte sold his 4,666 prints to the Museum of Art and
History. The museum slowly added to that over the years.
   The Brussels collection stands out for its extraordinary
sharpness in lines and richness in colors.
   Even in Michotte's days, experts charged the colors were so
fresh his prints had to be fakes. It was not until 1970 before
experts confirmed their authenticity beyond doubt, Kozyreff said.
   Many of the woodcuts are only known because Brussels has the one
remaining print.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Just James McMurtry</HEAD>

   James McMurtry is a soft-spoken man. He'll
sit and talk about his music, chain-smoking Winstons and grinning
when most people laugh, but he'd probably prefer to hand over his
first album and let it talk for him.
   Since his LP, ``Too Long in the Wasteland,'' came out in August,
he's been barraged by journalists looking for a story on the
talented songwriter and son of a talented author. His writing has
been compared to that of his father _ author Larry McMurtry
(``Lonesome Dove,'' ``The Last Picture Show'') _ and he's been
compared to more than a few musicians.
   He's heard it all: Lou Reed with a Texas accent, Mark Knopfler
with more of a country feel, Randy Newman with a softer cynicism,
Jerry Jeff Walker with a major record deal.
   But he's actually just James McMurtry with a guitar who takes it
all in typical Texas stride, flattered but not pressured.
   ``Style is a retrospective thing,'' he said recently, leaning
against the headboard of a motel bed. ``If my songs are getting
across then I'm doing my job.''
   ``James is only 26 years old, but he writes like he's lived a
lifetime,'' said musician John Cougar Mellencamp, who produced the
album for Columbia.
   McMurtry's father sent Mellencamp a tape of his son's songs
while the pair worked on a screenplay.
   James Lawrence McMurtry comes from a schooled background _ his
father, a Pulitzer Prize-winner, and his mother, an English teacher
at the University of Richmond. He spent most of his childhood in
Houston while his father taught at Rice University, and in Archer
City, Texas.
   His father gave him a guitar when he was 7, and his mother made
him learn to play it ``when she got tired of hearing me bang on the
thing.''
   During his approximately four years at the University of
Arizona, McMurtry gradually became more interested in performing at
the nearby Saw Mill Cafe in Tucson than in schoolwork.
   At least one icon from his English classes made an impression,
though. If listeners don't get the reference in the title song,
there's an apology in the liner notes to T.S. Eliot, who wrote the
celebrated poem ``The Wasteland.''
   ``I always liked Eliot,'' McMurtry said. ``I liked the way he
twisted those words around.''
   The songs on ``Too Long in the Wasteland'' fly by like an
aimless drive from one end of Texas to the other, and back again.
McMurtry's deadpan delivery provides the travelogue.
   He muses about poor fools going through the motions in
``Painting by Numbers,'' tells the story of a teen gone bad and
trying to go good in ``Terry,'' goes home and wonders if he ought
to leave the motor running in ``Outskirts'' and ``Poor Lost Soul,''
and hangs around shooting the breeze in ``Talkin' at the Texaco.''
   The last song, lamenting small-town life, comes closest to the
work of his father. It calls on McMurtry's experiences in Archer
City, long a wealth of creative inspiration for Larry McMurtry:
   ``Who you lookin' for, what was his name, you can probably find
him at the football game,'' McMurtry sings, a chorus of
questionable-sounding comrades swelling the background vocals.
``It's a small town, know what I mean, it's a small town and we all
support the team.''
   ``The words are work unless you accidentally come up with
something that fits,'' he explained. ``I usually stumble onto a
line, write it down, and start from the line. There's no
pre-arranged story.''
   At least one song comes straight from McMurtry's life. He got
the idea for ``Shining Eyes,'' a face-the-facts song about a
relationship in trouble, from an episode with his girlfriend, Elena.
   He was having a serious heart-to-heart with Elena on the phone
upstairs at a rare book store in Washington. ``I heard the phone
ringing downstairs, and I just let it ring. That's where that line
comes from, `when a telephone rings in an empty room.'''
   But unlike the song, which ends in wistful ambivalence, McMurtry
married Elena a few weeks ago. While he's on the road she's in
Austin, where the couple have a house.
   McMurtry started out playing songs by Guy Clark and David
Bromberg in Tucson, and after tending bar and playing in San
Antonio, he was encouraged by a friend to enter the Kerrville Folk
Festival in 1987.
   He was one of six winners that year and met songwriter Fred
Koller, who told him to stop by if he ever made it to Nashville.
McMurtry did and they cut some songs, one of which was considered
for the soundtrack for his father's ``Lonesome Dove'' miniseries,
``but they decided they didn't want any words,'' McMurtry said.
   By then, McMurtry's father had given the tape to Mellencamp, and
after a few months of writing, McMurtry had enough songs to go into
the studio.
   He tries to stay away from the business side of the industry and
focus on his music. And as far as he's concerned, the people at
Columbia have been very accommodating.
   ``They must think I'm a draw now,'' he grinned. ``They haven't
told me to cut my hair or dress in leopard skins or anything.''
   McMurtry wants to finish his road trip _ he's been touring since
August, and will quit just before Christmas _ and then try to put
some songs on paper and then on wax.
   But he still remembers a long-term goal, one he set when he was
banging on the guitar his father gave him. He laughs about it, but
it carries a bit of truth at the same time.
   ``I wanted to grow up to be Johnny Cash.''

   When Howard Norman isn't writing, he lobbies.
Actually, he sits in lobbies _ hotel lobbies, and especially, movie
lobbies.
   The author likes watching people buy tickets and walk inside. On
a cold day, he appreciates the smell and warmth of the popcorn
maker and coffee machine. And in his beloved Savoy Theater in
Vermont, there's a book left out for suggestions.
   So hotels and movie houses appear often in his work, which
includes the 1987 novel ``Northern Lights,'' nominated for the
National Book Award, and the recently published ``Kiss in the Hotel
Joseph Conrad (Summit, $18.95), a collection of short stories.
   ``In lobbies, one lives in a pure state of expectation,'' said
Norman, 40. ``You're in between. You're sort of safe. You haven't
been disappointed yet by anything that has happened.
   ``You're off the street. It has something to do with being
protected and not responsible but being able to observe and take
everything in.''
   Lobbies are like sneak previews for Norman, opportunities for
eavesdropping and observation. In his stories, lobbies are where
young lovers meet, old ones reunite and former actresses recapture
their past.
   In the title story of ``Kiss in the Hotel Joseph Conrad,'' a man
spends his entire life drifting from lobby to lobby as he pursues
an unrequited love from his youth, a woman who worked a kissing
booth during World War II.
   ``I was trying to show how one single event can consume a
person. Just seeing a woman and making that person your entire life
without any rhyme or reason except for an emotional one,'' he said.
   ``I didn't want to psychologize too much in these stories. It's
a conscious effort to take yourself out of the story. You always
tell young writers, `Show, don't tell.'''
   Norman, born in Iowa, had traveled extensively in Canada as a
writer for wildlife magazines and learned the native languages well
enough to produce three collections of translated works.
   The death of a friend helped inspire ``Northern Lights,'' in
which a teen-age boy, Noah, shuttles between a broken home in
Toronto and life in Quill, a northern Manitoba settlement where his
best friend, Pelly, has been killed in a freak accident.
   The seasons are important in ``Northern Lights.'' Summers, the
time for experience, are spent in Quill. As the days shorten and
winter arrives, Noah returns home.
   ``In summer you're out and time seems to be totally open to
you,'' Norman said. ``Everything seems possible.
   ``Winter seems to have direct conflicts in terms of your sense
of time. It closes you in, you have to bundle up. One's moods are
more acute. These characters seem to be very moody characters.''
   The novel's title is derived, naturally, from a movie theater
that Noah's mother purchases with the hope of bringing the family
together. In ``Whatever Lola Wants,'' a story from Norman's new
book, movies at the Moonlight drive-in theater shine on falling
snow.
   ``I've worked in two movie theaters, one when I was 16 and one
in college,'' Norman said. ``The first time I went to work in a
movie theater I thought that's what I'd be doing. I saw it as a
possible occupation. So I guess in that sense there was a domestic
aspect to it.''
   Disappointment, Norman said, is another important part of his
work. Not just unrequited love, but the loss of innocence, the
inability to enjoy life without complications.
   In ``Whatever Lola Wants,'' the title character is a former
actress from the 1940s who persuades her husband to show one of her
old films, ``White Savage,'' at the Moonlight. Watching the film,
in which she is captured by cannibals, Lola sadly reflects on
dreams long faded:
   ``That scene when the camera is on me, just before the cannibals
arrive. Just by campfire light that way, with everything about my
face and character calm and brave and just right. When I was a
girl, that's who I wanted to be.''
   The friendship of Noah and Pelly in ``Northern Lights'' is
written with the same longing for simplicity.
   ``I thought of how at that age you have a friendship without
what happens later when you start to psychologize,'' the author
said. ``The kind of friendship you have at that age, which is why
coming-of-age novels are fundamentally of such interest to people.
   ``Those friendships are unlike anything you have later. You're
almost entirely relating on an emotional level to the other person.
You're just interested in his company. You aren't alone.''
   But for Norman, the teen-ager's desire for companionship has
given way to a writer's need for privacy, even in a crowded lobby.
   ``It has something to do with the fact that as you get older,
you feel your time is less your own,'' he said. ``You have
responsibilities, like money, no matter how isolated you're living.
Your time is precious.
   ``You can live vicariously in a hotel lobby like the Algonquin.
You watch people come and go, just sit in the lobby and totally
live a vicarious existence.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Billy `Crash' Craddock Is `Back on Track'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Billy ``Crash'' Craddock, who had a
litany of hits in the 1970s, but who gave up making records in
1981, has returned with an album aptly titled ``Back on Track.''
   After releasing such hits as ``Knock Three Times,'' ``Rub It
In,'' ``Easy as Pie'' and ``Broken Down in Tiny Pieces,'' Craddock
quit the studio to ponder his future and keep an eye on his bank
balance.
   Nicknamed for his crashing style of play in high school
football, he kept active by making personal appearances. He signed
with Atlantic Records and ``Back on Track'' is his first recording
for the label.
   He won't go into detail about his problems, but he was a party
to a lawsuit involving the country group Alabama.
   Craddock was a co-owner of a booking agency that promoted
concerts by the award-winning four-piece band. Alabama and the
agency became embroiled in a $3 million suit over commissions. The
matter was settled out of court in 1987 and the terms were never
announced.
   ``Nobody ever needs to be in a lawsuit,'' Craddock said.
``Everything is cool now. Nobody wins in a lawsuit. It's going to
hurt you one way or another. You may win one way but it's going to
hurt you in another.
   ``When you are involved in a lawsuit, you've got other things on
your mind when you try to do a road show. You can't get your mind
on recording. So I backed away a little.
   ``When you have certain problems, you kind of feel rejected. I
didn't know whether to retire or make another stab at it. I kind of
wanted people to accept me again. I wasn't sure if they would or
not.''
   His version of ``Knock Three Times'' in 1971 ignited a string of
nine No. 1 records and 20 others that reached the Top 10 of the
country charts. He took Tony Orlando's pop version of the song,
added fiddles and came up with a country alternative that made the
tune one of the most heard of its time.
   In his heyday, Craddock gave one of the most dynamic concerts in
country music. Clad in form-fitting outfits, he gyrated across the
stage and flirted with fans.
   His show hasn't changed much, as he does up-tempo songs, ballads
and a rock 'n' roll medley of old tunes. His followers have
remained loyal.
   The first single released from Craddock's comeback album is
``Just Another Miserable Day (Here in Paradise),'' which is about a
man in Florida separated from his lover. Other cuts include his
version of the Hank Williams Sr. hit ``I Can't Help It (If I'm
Still in Love With You)'' and the nostalgic ``The Girls That
Everybody Knew,'' whose lyrics rattle off the names of girls
mentioned in hit songs down through the years (Barbara Ann, Mary
Lou, Peggy Sue).
   ``I think we're headed in the right direction now,'' he said.
``I don't think it (the recording hiatus) hurt too much because
we've been traveling lots of days and the fans have still been
coming out.''

Commercial Workers Union said.
   _ Between 1981 and 1983, meatpacking production jumped by 52
percent, the union said, while employment declined by almost 20
percent.
</TEXT>

   AUTOS:
   _ Total injury rates in large plants in the motor vehicle
industry reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1987 were
2.5 times those reported in 1985, according to congressional

<HEAD>Wharton Replaces Stolen Photo of Junk-Bond King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, the indicted junk bond
financier, has been returned to the ``alumni honor roll'' at his
graduate school alma mater.
   The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School said it has
replaced a photograph of Milken that was stolen earlier this month.
The new picture was put up Friday without ceremony, Wharton
spokeswoman Denise Portner said.
   The Milken photograph, together with 17 other picture-plaques,
will remain until students vote at an unspecified date on a new
group of alumni to be placed on the so-called alumni honor roll.
Those now shown were chosen in 1986.
   Among alumni honored on the Wharton wall are entrepreneur Donald
Trump, media magnate Walter Annenberg, Supreme Court Justice
William Brennan, CBS founder William Paley, Apple Computer Inc.'s
John Sculley, Robert Crandall of American Airlines and beer tycoon
August Busch III.
   Honored Wharton alumni are selected on the basis of outstanding
achievements and contributions to society.
   Milken was indicted in March on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud in connection with his activities with the Wall Street
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., where he headed the
junk bond division. He has pleaded innocent.
   Milken resigned from Drexel in June. Drexel in September pleaded
guilty to six counts of securities-law violations and began paying
a record $650 million in fines and penalties.
   The trial of Milken and two co-defendants is scheduled to begin
in March.

<HEAD>T-Shirts: $10 Billion Business in `Wearable Art'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't call them T-shirts. ``Imprinted sportswear''
is the language preferred these days in a $10 billion business that
has its roots in the tie-dyed 1960s.
   ``It started ... when people found out you could take a T-shirt
and put a message on it,'' said Milt Anglin, general merchandise
manager for Waco-based Plus Companies, which owns the nation's
largest chain of retail T-shirt stores.
   Screen printers, monogrammers and applique-makers vied with
clothing manufacturers, distributors and designers for attention at
the Imprinted Sportswear Convention here last week.
   About 6,000 people attended the convention, which featured
displays ranging from neon-bright shirts and shorts to basic black
and white shirts. Decorations included fabric paint, sequins, foil
transfers and various trinkets.
   Officials said 1.6 billion T-shirts were sold in the United
States last year, with more than 20 percent of American shoppers
buying 10 or more shirts. Anglin estimated that 90 percent of the
T-shirt business is in shirts and other articles priced from $15 to
$35 and imprinted with everything from favorite colleges to rock
groups to cartoon characters _ Mickey Mouse and Batman are big this
year _ to free-form designs with ``tons of glitz.''
   ``T-shirts have moved up to high fashion and high profits,''
Anglin said. ``A dollar's worth of trim should yield up to five
times the original value of the shirt.''
   For Dino Calabrese, a design consultant for Transfermania Inc.,
clothing is a canvas for wearable art.
   Calabrese, said he once used transfers to create a $900 evening
dress and spends much time looking for new things to stick on
clothes. ``Right now, I'm looking at a fabric developed out of
cork,'' he said.
   And yes, tie-dye is back, meaning hipsters of 25 years ago can
impress their children.
   Upon seeing an old tie-dyed shirt, Anglin said his 20-year-old
daughter was dumbfounded. ``I had no idea you were so cool,'' she
told him.
   Calabrese said imprinted clothing _ shoes, jackets, caps or
T-shirts that become dresses _ allows individuality. ``People are
very much into doing their own thing these days,'' he said, echoing
the tie-dyed era.

   British Airways PLC has bailed out of a group
attempting to buy UAL Corp., a defection that sent UAL stock into
another tailspin and dealt the buyout plan its second stunning blow
in a week.
   The pilots union at UAL's United Airlines, which along with
management is leading the buyout attempt, quickly announced Friday
it was developing a new plan that would include for the first time
United's flight attendants as partners.
   In a brief statement, British Airways said it ``does not intend
to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the
foreseeable future.'' It didn't give reasons, but said its
marketing agreement with United would remain in effect.

the federal government coordinates its regulation of financial
markets, ``the better off we're going to be.''
   In his first extensive discussion of last week's sudden market
drop, Brady said Friday there was no ``air of panic'' within the
administration after the Dow Jones average dropped 190 points last
Friday.
   He said he spent much of Monday _ when the market rebounded

<HEAD>Dollar Higher in Calm Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly higher in calm trading in
Europe early today and dealers said they expected little movement
in the currency until the publication of U.S. economic growth
figures on Thursday.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range between 1.85 and
1.86 West German marks, and likely would stay there until the
release of U.S. gross national product estimates for the third
quarter, dealers said.
   ``The bulls and bears are in balance, so I don't see major
changes until Thursday,'' said Dieter Manderbach, a trader at
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Hanover, West Germany.
   Another dealer, at a European bank in Frankfurt, said: ``It's
very sluggish right now. ... A trend in one or the other direction
should crystallize after the (GNP) figures.''
   Economists expected the third-quarter growth rate to be little
changed from its moderate 2.5 percent in the second quarter, but
some traders anticipated a sharp slowdown.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 142.40 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 142.47 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.8570 West German marks, up from 1.8535; 1.6295
Swiss francs, up from 1.6255; 6.3040 French francs, up from 6.2962;
2.0970 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0973; 1,365.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,363.65; and 1.1730 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1732.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5875 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5885 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $366.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price also of $365.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $365.90 compared with $366.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 53 cents to close at a bid
$366.54.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.08 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.09.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced slightly.
   The dollar closed at 142.40 yen, up 1.05 yen from Friday's close
of 141.35 yen. After opening at 141.95 yen, the dollar ranged from
141.95-142.40 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 112.16-point
gainer Friday, added 99.14 points, or 0.27 percent, closing the
day's session at 35,585.52.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained relatively strong
against the yen despite a lack of fresh market-affecting news.
   ``The market tried the downside of the dollar in Sydney,'' said
Minori Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank. ``Then in the afternoon
in Tokyo traders began to cover their short dollar positions. There
weren't any strong trends.''
   Traders said the market was closely watching the activity of the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the American central bank, for signs of
an ease in monetary policy.
   ``Market players are interested in whether the Federal Reserve
Board will consider taking an easy credit policy in view of U.S.
economic indices'' to be released this week, said a dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously.
   The upcoming U.S. economic figures include the nation's
third-quarter gross national product, due out Thursday, and the
personal income and consumption spending figures for September, due
Friday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to gain for the
fifth consecutive trading day.
   ``Volume was low at 600 million shares, but good for a Monday.
People were feeling quite confident,'' said Stephen Hill, head of
sales at Jardine Fleming Securities.
   He said non-life insurance companies rose on stories of mergers
and acquisitions, and recovered from their drop following the San
Francisco earthquake last week. ``There was a realization that they

   Stock prices rose in light trading Monday on
cautious hopes for British trade figures for September, to be
announced Tuesday.
   ``There is a growing feeling that it's about time we had a good
trade number,'' said one London dealer. ``If so, it would give the
market an excuse to rally.''
   Analysts were expecting a current account deficit of 1.6 billion
pounds, or $2.5 billion, for September, compared with August's 2
billion-pound shortfall.
   With many players waiting for the trade figures, most early
dealings Monday were limited to market makers, who were ``shuffling
positions,'' one trader said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was at a
session high of 2,194.6 points, up 15.5 points, or 0.7 percent. At
its lowest, the index stood at 2,179.5.
   Volume was a very light 127.1 million shares, compared with
206.9 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>New Employee-Management Bid Reported Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor-management group is considering a revised
buyout offer for UAL Corp. that would give employees a majority
stake in the airline holding company and leave some stock in public
hands, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   The Journal said the group is seeking reactions to the new deal,
valued at $225 to $240 a share, or about $5.09 billion.
   To avoid the risk of rejection, the group doesn't plan to
formally present the plan at a UAL board meeting today, the
newspaper said.
   Instead, the bidding group will seek binding commitments from
banks covering all the money needed to finance the buyout before
making a formal proposal, the Journal said. The group hasn't fully
developed the idea yet or discussed it with banks, according to the
Journal.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune said the
employee-management group intends to submit a revised proposal to
the UAL board at today's meeting.
   Representatives of United's top management, pilots and flight
attendants prepared a proposal over the weekend and will present it
at today's board meeting, the papers reported in today's editions.
The Chicago newspapers said the bid is in the range of $220 to $250
a share.
   Such an offer would be substantially lower than the $6.75
billion, or $300-a-share, offer the board accepted in September.
That leveraged buyout collapsed when it failed to get necessary
bank financing.
   The original deal would have given management and labor an 85
percent stake in UAL under the largest employee buyout in corporate
history. British Airways PLC would have taken a 15 percent
ownership stake in return for a $750 million investment.
   After the deal's financing fell through on Oct. 13, sparking a
rout on Wall Street and a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones
industrial average, uncertainty surrounding the situation caused
British Airways to pull out.
   No new investor has been found to replace the foreign carrier,
all three newspapers reported.
   Citicorp reportedly approached potential lenders last week,
offering higher interest rates and loan fees. The bank has not,
however, offered term sheets, the written terms that must first be
approved by the buyout group.
   United's directors have a difficult decision to make, analysts
said. United shares last week lost 40 percent of their value, or
$111.25. On Friday United stock closed at $168.50.
   A significantly lower bid might be hard for shareholders to
swallow, particularly those who bought shares for $250 or more. If
the directors accept a lower offer, they could be vulnerable to
shareholder lawsuits, analysts said.
   But if they reject the offer, a corporate raider might buy up
low-priced UAL stock and then seek stockholder consent to oust the
board.
   An alternative, some say, is a partial financial restructuring
giving shareholders a large cash dividend and securities. Such a
plan would give employees a sizable stake, if not a majority, in
the company.

<HEAD>Grain Markets Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with
harvest pressure offsetting the positive impact of new export sales.
   The corn market fell after opening nearly unchanged, surprising
analysts who had expected a higher opening based on the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Friday that the Soviet Union had
bought 2.8 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   The confirmation brought to more than 7.8 million metric tons
the total amount of corn purchased by Soviets since the new crop
year began Sept. 1.
   ``The question from here is, are they going to buy more or are
we pretty well done,'' said William Biedermann, director of
research with Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake,
Ill. ``That's why we're kind of stalled here.''
   Further selling was linked to the fine harvest weather that
occurred in the Midwest over the weekend and is predicted for the
region through Friday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.41 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 2 cents lower with December at $2.41 a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ cent higher with December at
$1.44} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher
with November at $5.62 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after Friday's USDA report
showing fewer cattle on feed than the market had expected.
   Live cattle futures were .22 cent to .68 cent higher with
December at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .65
cent higher with October at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent lower to .45 cent higher with December at 47.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .18 cent higher with
February at 52.95 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures
advanced.

<HEAD>Exxon's Third-Quarter Earnings Dip 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. said today its third-quarter profit
fell 9 percent due mainly to a $373 million stock repurchase and
lower refining and marketing earnings.
   Costs associated with the Alaska oil spill did not affect
third-quarter results, Exxon said, although the company continued
cleanup efforts during the period.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Exxon said its
earnings totaled $1.11 billion, or 87 cents a share, down from
$1.23 billion, or 93 cents a share in the comparable 1988 period.
Revenue rose 8 percent to $23.66 billion from $21.89 billion a year
ago.
   Exxon said the repurchase of more than 8 million shares of its
stock for $373 million contributed to the lower results.
   In addition, U.S. and foreign refining and marketing earnings
declined by $180 million during the quarter, although they remained
above those of the second period. Chemicals earnings also declined,
while interest expense increased due mainly to the acquisition of
Texaco Canada by Exxon's Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd.
   For the first nine months, Exxon's earnings fell 34.5 percent to
$2.54 billion, or $1.99 a share, from $3.88 billion, or $2.89 a
share. The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's
provision for the March 24 Alaska spill in which the supertanker
Exxon Valdez crashed into a reef, spewing millions of gallons into
Prince William Sound.
   A special provision in the second quarter for expenses and
insurance claims stemming from the spill reduced its net income by
$850 million, or 67 cents a share.
   Without the provision, Exxon said its net income for the first
nine months would have been $3.4 billion, or $2.68 a share.
   Revenue for the nine months rose to $69.51 billion from $65.52
billion a year earlier.

   McDonald's Corp. reported on Monday a 14
percent increase in its third-quarter earnings due largely to
strong sales overseas and domestic promotional programs.
   For the latest three months, the company that made the Big Mac a
worldwide phenomenon reported net income of $217.9 million, or 59
cents a share, up from $191 million, or 51 cents a share, a year

   Third-quarter revenue rose 9.4 percent to $1.63 billion from

franchised restaurants as well as those that are company-owned,
rose 9 percent to $4.58 billion from $4.19 billion in third-quarter
of 1988.
   The company said sales growth was particularly strong in markets
outside of the United States, especially in Europe.
   Contributing to improved U.S. sales were marketing and
promotional programs that include ``Happy Birthday Big Mac'' and
the firm's Scrabble game, McDonald's said.
   ``In addition, sales were positively impacted by the national
introduction of the McChicken sandwich in the United States in May
... .'' the company said.
   For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, net income rose 12
percent to $555 million, or $1.49 a share, from $494 million, or
$1.31 a share, a year ago.
   Nine-month revenue totaled $4.5 billion, up 11 percent from $4.1
billion for the first nine months of 1988, the company said.
Systemwide sales rose to $12.8 billion, up 8 percent from $11.9
billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Cummins Engine Co. on Monday reported
third-quarter losses of $39.7 million, blaming a decline in engine
orders from makers of heavy-duty trucks, the company's largest
single market.
   Cummins said the losses, equal to $4.12 a share, compared with
losses of $17.6 million, or $1.84 a share, in the same 1988 period.
   The engine maker reported third-quarter sales of $807.6 million,
compared with $808.3 million in last year's quarter.
   Cummins also noted a 30 percent decline from a year ago in sales
of generator sets for marine and recreational vehicle markets at
its largest subsidiary, Onan Corp.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Cummins reported profits of
$3.6 million on sales of $2.65 billion. But after deducting
preferred and preference stock dividends, the company reported a
per-share loss of 31 cents.
   In the first three quarters last year, Cummins had losses of
$8.43 million, or $1.36 a share, on sales of $2.44 billion.
   Anticipating the quarterly loss, the company recently laid off
300 production workers and temporarily reduced the pay of some
salaried employees and executives.
   Salaried workers' pay was reduced by 5 percent, while some
company officers reduced their pay by 7.5 percent to 10 percent.
   The cut-cutting measures affected only employees at the
company's plants in southern Indiana.

<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. said Monday its
profits fell 35 percent in the third quarter because of softening
prices for some of its chemical products.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $139 million, or
98 cents per share, compared with $213 million, or $1.56 per share,
in the third quarter of 1988.
   Consolidated sales for the quarter rose 2 percent to $2.14
billion from $2.11 billion, due mainly to an increase in sales in
the company's industrial gases industry segment. Union Carbide said
the increase helped offset reduced sales in chemicals and plastics.
   Overall operating profit was $331 million, a 23 percent decline
from $430 million in the third quarter in 1988.
   Union Carbide said prices for polyethylene and ethylene oxide
and glocyols continued to soften in the third quarter, causing the
drop in net income.
   Earnings for the first nine months were $526 million, or $3.74 a
share, up 5 percent from $501 million, or $3.71 a share, in the
same period last year. Nine month sales rose to $6.66 billion from
$6.19 billion.

<TEXT>
   The 1980s have been financially successful years
for millions of Americans, but they also have been years of
repeated warnings about great financial collapses and recessions to
come.
   There has been little sense of security, almost no comfort in
material achievement, because of the constant threats that all
could disappear in a wink. The economy was prone to earthquakes.
Hundreds of ``experts'' said so.
   One reason for the sense of insecurity has been the problem of
debt _ of personal, business, municipal, state, federal,
international debt, the multibillion-dollar likes of which had
never been seen before.
   Debts on houses, debts on cars, debts to Uncle Sam, education
debts, credit card debts, debts to the Japanese, uncollectable
debts owed by Third World nations to big Western banks. Easy
credit, it was said, was undermining human and financial values.
   In such an atmosphere of fear, some critics went to extremes.
They reasoned that if everyone is screaming, they have to scream
even louder to make a point. Nothing short of total collapse could
get a listener's attention.
   It led to ``The Coming'' style of analysis _ the coming Great
Depression, the coming collapse in home prices, the coming banking
disaster, the coming great inflation, the coming interest-rate
surge, the coming decline of the United States.
   So, where have those coming events gone?
   Oddly, some of them might already have taken place, not in their
ultimate, extreme, catastrophic form, but in smaller doses. The big
quake didn't occur, but there have been many sizable, lesser
tremors.
   The financial system hasn't collapsed in its entirety, for
example, but repeatedly there have been large and painful financial
disasters.
   Thousands of farmers lost their land in the decade, many of them
after violating their own conservative beliefs. They borrowed money
and bought land at inflated prices. Some of that land fell to a
third of its purchase price.
   Some of the richest, most independent, glamorous entrepreneurs
the country has ever produced were wiped out when crude oil prices
collapsed. Their buddies in real estate speculation went down with
them.
   Simultaneously, commercial banks were forced to write off
billions of dollars in debt to the less developed nations, after
making loans that almost everyone in the nation except bankers knew
were overly risky.
   Savings and loan institutions collapsed, at a cost to the
country of scores of billions of dollars. Junk bond deals have
fallen apart, wiping away billions in paper profits. The stock
market has collapsed twice in two years.
   Who said there haven't been financial and economic earthquakes?
   Edward Yardeni, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. economist,
who doesn't allow such terrible events to lead to despair, calls
attention to some positive considerations. Assets well exceed
debts, for example, and savings continue to exceed credit demands.
Moreover, personal savings are now rising.
   What about the coming recession? Well, to some extent that too
might have happened. It wasn't officially recorded as a recession,
but conceivably it could some day be recognized as such.
   It occurred in mid-1986, when by some statistical measurements
there might have been more than 30 states in recession. Offsetting
this, however, were booms on the coasts. In national statistics,
the booms hid the busts.
   The ``recession'' of 1986 didn't go altogether unrecorded.
   In the second quarter of 1986 there was a decided decline in
economic activity, but official figures still recorded gross
national product as expanding. Two years later the government
revised the reading to show a loss.
   Meanwhile, the government also revised third-quarter numbers. In
1987 they revised downward the GNP reading for that 1986 quarter,
and they revised it lower again in 1988 _ and again in 1989. Next
year, it could show a loss.
   Two quarterly losses of gross national product constitute at
least one definition of recession. But if we had one in 1986, we
probably won't know it until 1990.
   In short, the total catastrophes might not have occurred, but
there have been several lesser shocks. It leaves us to ask the
question: Did these shocks relieve pressure, or are they precursors
of the Big One?

<TEXT>
   Allied-Signal Inc. said Monday its
third-quarter profit edged up 1.7 percent as lower returns from its
automotive operations offset increases in aerospace and engineered
materials.
   Net income for the third quarter was $121 million, or 81 cents
per share, compared with $119 million, or 80 cents per share, a
year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue slipped to $2.83 billion from $2.86
billion a year earlier.
   Excluding onetime charges, the company said net income from its
aerospace business rose 34 percent to $55 million while net income
from its engineered materials business rose 4.8 percent to $66
million.
   However, the company reported net income from its automotive
operations fell to $11 million this year from $33 million last
year, excluding onetime charges. It blamed overall declines in
original equipmnmet car and trucks sales, increased investment in
anti-lock brake systems, unfavorable foreign exchange conversion
and an unusually low effective tax rate last year.
   ``We foresee continued strength in both our aerospace and
engineered materials businesses and a rebound in our automotive
operations,'' said Edward L. Hennessy, Jr., the company's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   For the first nine months, Allied-Signal said it earned $413
million, or $2.77 a share, up 15 percent from $359 million, or
$2.40 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue slipped to $8.88 billion from $8.90 billion a
year earlier.

   Share prices closed modestly higher Monday on the
London Stock Exchange, in the lightest volume so far this year,
ahead of Tuesday's release of British trade figures for September.
   Dealers said the day's modest gains signaled some support for
London equities. They pegged the support largely to anticipation
that Britain's trade imbalance cannot be much worse than the
near-record deficits seen in July and August.
   But the very light volume reflected nervousness, dealers said.
   Volume was 276.8 million shares, breaking the year's previous
low of 280.5 million shares recorded on Sept. 25. Last Friday,
351.3 million shares changed hands.
   ``It's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid
to sell,'' said a senior dealer with the London investment firm
Kleinwort Benson Securities. ``It's better to wait.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 10.6
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,189.7.
   The index opened at a session low of 2,179.5 and rose to a high
of 2,195.9 shortly before Wall Street opened on a slightly weak
note.
   The early action in New York helped knock London's 100-share
index down a bit in late trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 11.6 points higher at
1,772.6. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.2 points to
close at 1,215.62.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
narrowly mixed Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade with prices for
near-month corn and wheat deliveries supported by export demand and
other contracts weakened by harvest pressure.
   Indications that China was seeking to buy 330,000 metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat prompted buying of December wheat futures,
analysts said.
   The Agriculture Department's confirmation last Friday of a sale
of 2.8 million metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union helped
to limit losses in the December corn market. The confirmation
brought to more than 7.8 million metric tons the total amount of
corn purchased by the Soviets for delivery in the new crop year,
which began Sept. 1.
   Contracts for deferred delivery of corn finished moderately
lower on selling linked to forecasts for continued good harvesting
weather in the Midwest.
   A USDA report released after the close of trading showed a 20
percent increase in the amount of wheat inspected for export last
week compared with the previous week, while corn and soybean
inspections were little changed.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 2{ cents lower to } cent
higher with December at $4.07} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2{
cents lower with December at $2.41\ a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1 cent higher with December at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were {

<HEAD>Bankers Trust Posts $1.42 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers Trust New York Corp. on Monday posted a
third-quarter loss of $1.42 billion, confirming an amount revealed
recently when Bankers Trust announced a big boost in its loan-loss
reserve to cover problem debt.
   The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 came to $17.39 a
share and compared with a profit of $162.1 million, or $2.01 a
share, in 1988's third quarter.
   Last week the New York-based bank holding company said it was
making a $1.6 billion special addition to its provision for
potentially bad Third World loans, joining a long list of major
U.S. banks that have bolstered their reserves.
   The special addition raised Bankers Trust's allowance for credit
losses to $2.91 billion, or 14 percent of total loans on Sept. 30.
   If it hadn't set aside the additional funds, Bankers Trust would
have earned $180 million, or $2.18 a share, in the third quarter,
up $17.9 mlilion or 11 percent from a year earlier.
   Bankers Trust Chairman Charles S. Sanford Jr. said that apart
from the loan-loss provision, third-quarter results benefited from
higher noninterest revenue and a lower effective tax rate.
   These were partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses
and provisions for debts _ other than the special addition.
   Noninterest revenue totaled $505 million in the third quarter,
up $57.7 million or 13 percent from a year earlier. Higher fees and
commissions plus increases in trust and custodian revenue
contributed to the overall gain in noninterest revenue.
   A decline in revenue, however, partially offset the increases.
Revenue fell $33.7 million to $82.3 million.
   The effective tax rate was 18 percent in the third quarter
compared with 31 percent in the third 1988 quarter.
   Total noninterest expenses were $470.5 million, up $54.4 million
or 13 percent over 1988.
   For the first nine months of the year, Bankers Trust lost $1.08
billion, or $13.27 a share, compared with earnings of $462.2
million, or $5.80 a share, a year earlier.
   Excluding the third-quarter loan-loss provision, nine-month
earnings would have been $518.9 million, $6.34 a share, up $56.7
million or 12 percent from the first three quarters of 1988.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Monday its
third-quarter earnings climbed 29 percent from a year earlier,
citing significantly higher revenue at its ABC Television Network,
its TV stations and the ESPN cable network.
   The company, which also has interests in radio and publishing,
said it earned $80.8 million, or $4.56 a share, in the three months
ended Sept. 30 compared with $62.6 million, or $3.55 a share, a
year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 9 percent to $1.10 billion from $1.01
billion a year earlier.
   Chairman Thomas S. Murphy said stronger advertising demand
boosted revenue at the ABC Television network, the company's eight
TV stations and the 80 percent-owned ESPN cable network.
   Operating income rose 14 percent to $157.3 million, as income
from broadcasting rose 18 percent and publishing edged up 1 percent.
   The TV stations and ESPN reported significant increases in
operating earnings, while higher program and news-gathering costs
moderated the earnings improvement at the ABC Television Network.
   For the first nine months, Capital Cities-ABC said net income
rose 23 percent to $303.7 million, or $16.97 a share, from $246.9
million, or $14.43 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue slipped to $3.45 billion from $3.46 billion a
year earlier.
   Capital Cities-ABC also owns the ABC Radi Networks and 21 radio
stations, and publishes nine daily newspapers as well as weekly
newspapers, shopping guides, books and specialized periodicals.

<HEAD>Treasury, SEC Heads Talk to Congress This Week About Market Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress hopes to get an inside look at how
the federal government handled the recent stock market plunge when
two key officials testify at separate hearings this week.
   On Wednesday, a House panel is slated to hear from Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, in his first
congressional appearance since the market slid more than 190 points
on Friday, Oct. 13.
   The following day, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is to
appear before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   The hearings were scheduled before the stock market's Oct. 13
decline, but that market drop and continuing concern about another
crash like the one in October 1987 are expected to overshadow both
sessions.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., has told Breeden the stock
plunge ``adds new and compelling impetus to your testimony.''
   He asked Breeden and his staff to reconstruct what happened
during the selloff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, which Markey chairs.
   Legislation is pending in both houses of Congress that would
expand the SEC's powers to monitor the markets in several ways,
some of them opposed by various segments of the industry.
   The market reforms were proposed by the SEC after the stock
market crash in 1987.
   The ones that have sparked controversy include giving the SEC
authority to request reports on large securities and options trades
to track who's trading what to whom. Another would requires rules
for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies that are
the parent companies of broker dealers.
   In congressional testimony earlier this month, the heads of the
New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange supported
those changes, but the president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Joseph R. Hardiman, had some reservations.
   Edward I. O'Brien, president of Securities Industry Association,
said Monday that the trade group ``is opposed to both bills, as
written, but we are hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve
the SEC's goals.''
   O'Brien is expected to spell out the SIA's position at
Wednesday's hearing before Markey's subcommittee. In addition to
O'Brien and Breeden, George S. Bissell, chairman of the
Boston-based Keystone Group of mutual funds also is to testify on
proposed market reforms.
   But the main topic is expected to be Wall Street's Friday the
13th. That's when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial companies'
stocks, a key market indicator, plunged 190.58 points in the final
hours of trading.
   Many nervously compared the drop to October 1987 when Dow fell
more than 100 points on a Friday before plummeting a record 508
points in the Black Monday crash.
   This time around the market rebounded, closing up 88.12 points a
week ago Monday. Washington officials, headed by Brady, worked to
restore calm over the weekend while quietly conferring with the
exchanges, various government agencies and foreign trading partners.
   Some Democrats in Congress, however, say it's time to re-examine
changes recommended, but never implemented, by a presidential task
force headed by Brady before he took the Treasury post.
   ``Recent events have indicated the need to review the
recommendations of the Brady Commission,'' Sen. Donald W. Riegle,
D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee, said.
   Brady will be the sole witness before that committee Thursday.
   The Brady Commission proposed having one agency coordinate
regulation of all financial markets. The plan never was implemented
by the Reagan administration.
   Then and now, the SEC oversaw stock and options markets, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulated futures markets and
the Federal Reserve set stock margins and supervised the payments
system among banks and brokerage houses.
   The market reforms proposed by Congress include giving the SEC
chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in
emergencies. Currently, only the president can order such a
shutdown.
   But Breeden has said he does not want that power and does not
think it should be exercised.
   In written answers to questions during Senate confirmation for
the SEC post, Breeden said such authority would create too much
uncertainty about when the markets would close and for how long.
   ``In a crisis, this uncertainty and the related rumors
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse
consequences,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Erstwhile Buyer of MGM-UA Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resort-entertainment company Qintex
Australia Ltd., hurt by financial problems including the collapse
of its $1.5 billion deal to buy MGM-UA Communications Co.,
announced a broad restructuring Monday aimed at generating hundreds
of millions of dollars in savings and asset sales.
   The announcement came after the Australian Stock Exchange
suspended trading in Qintex because the company hadn't answered an
exchange question about its loans, investments and deposits to
Qintex Entertainment Inc., a U.S. affiliate.
   Los Angeles-based Qintex Entertainment filed for protection from
creditors late Thursday under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The filing gives the company a repreive from creditors while
it works out a way to pay debts.
   Qintex Australia, a Sydney-based operator of resorts and
television stations, plans to sell its remaining 51 percent stake
in Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii, said Chairman
Christopher Skase.
   Skase said in a news release that the company also will
accelerate plans to sell its Adelaide television station in
southern Australia and two regional stations in Queensland.
   The sales are expected to generate more than 600 million
Australian dollars, or about $460 million, reduce interest costs
and eliminate other financial liabilities, Skase said.
   Qintex intends to retain a long-term management contract on the
resorts to generate fee income.
   In March, Qintex sold a 49 percent stake in the three Mirage
resorts to Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui &amp; Co. for 433 million
Australian dollars, or about $333.4 million. At the time, Skase
said that new resorts were planned for southern California and
Florida.
   The announcement Monday didn't say if the Japanese companies
would acquire Qintex's remaining stake in the resorts.
   The planned corporate restructuring involves the merger of
Qintex Australia with Qintex Ltd., which owns 55 percent of Qintex
Australia. Skase said this move would ``significantly reduce
administrative costs.''
   Before trading was suspended, Qintex Australia shares had
plunged to 16 Australian cents from 33 cents Friday. The shares had
traded at around 1.50 Australian dollars in March, when Qintex
announced the plan to acquire MGM@UA.
   MGM@UA on Oct. 10 scrapped the agreement, saying the Australian
company failed to deliver a $50 million letter of credit that it
was supposed to supply as security in the transaction.
   Skase said Monday that ``group cash flow has been negatively
impacted by an excess of 200 million Australian dollars'' because
of four recent problems.
   The problems included what Skase characterized as an ``unlawful
termination'' by MGM@UA of the acquisition pact and ``consequential
impact on Qintex Entertainment,'' which was denied access to
banking facilities after the deal dissolved.
   High Australian interest rates also are hurting its business,
Skase said. He traced some of the troubles at the Australian Mirage
resorts to a strike by domestic airline pilots.
   The deferral of a settlement in a previously announced sale of
two Queensland regional TV stations also hurt, Skase said.
   Monday's announcement responded to the stock exchange's question
about Qintex's exposure to Qintex Entertainment, which is 43
percent-owned by the Australian company. The U.S. affiliate owes
Qintex Australia $38.1 million in unsecured loans.
   Qintex Australia said it has a further investment of $83.3
million in Qintex Entertainment shares.

   The dollar drifted lower in lackluster trading
Monday as currency markets around the world awaited direction from
U.S. economic reports due this week.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold for current delivery settled at $367 a troy ounce, down 30
cents from Friday's settlement. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a 4 p.m. EDT gold bid of $366.25 an ounce, 25 cents lower
than Friday's late bid.
   Dealers at home and abroad reported that there recently has been
reluctance to establish significant new positions in dollars until
a clearer economic picture emerges.
   The reluctance has kept the dollar trading in a narrow range
against other major currencies.
   A report on orders for durable goods is due Tuesday from the
Commerce Department followed Thursday by the department's first
estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross national product, the
government's broadest measure of economic health.
   The dollar also has been weighed down by speculation that U.S.
interest rates might recede in the near future. Lower rates would
reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to lessen
demand for dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 142.40 Japanese yen from
141.35 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, the dollar ended
unchanged at 142.40 yen. It was quoted at 141.90 yen in New York,
down from 142.42 yen on Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5945 from $1.5885 late
Friday. A pound cost $1.6030 at the end of New York trading,
compared with $1.5885 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8578;
1.6190 Swiss francs, down from 1.6285; 6.2740 French francs, down
from 6.3105; 1.1704 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1741; and
1,356.00 Italian lire, down from 1,367.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.8550 West German marks, up from 1.8535; 1.6270
Swiss francs, up from 1.6255; 6.3050 French francs, up from 6.2962;
2.0965 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0973; 1,364.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,363.65; and, 1.1720 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1732.
   Gold bullion fell in what dealers called one of the slowest
sessions in months.
   In London, the metal fell to a late bid price of $365.75 a troy
ounce, down from $366.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, gold declined to $365.60 bid from $366
bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 53 cents to close at $366.54.
   Silver bullion barely budged in quiet dealings and closed
unchanged. Silver was quoted in London at a late bid price of $5.09
a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday's late bid price. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.089 an
ounce, the same as late Friday.

<HEAD>Europeans, Americans Offer Proposals on Services Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community and the United
States Monday offered separate proposals on how to include trade in
services in the framework of the current round of negotiations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The proposals, which will be discussed this week by
representatives of the 96-member GATT, aim to set guidelines on
trade in such services as insurance, banking, tourism, engineering
and data processing.
   The current Uruguay Round of GATT talks is the first to attempt
to include services in its mandate to liberalize world trade.
   Details of the U.S. proposal weren't released Monday, but the EC
proposal was released to reporters in Geneva.
   The EC warns against adopting too broad a definition of
services, saying such a move would be tantamount to ``liberalizing
all investment and all labor movement.''
   ``The Community doesn't consider that an all-embracing, generic
definition of trade in services, which stands on its own, will be
feasible,'' the EC said, adding that it is too difficult to develop
``unambiguous, universal criteria.''

<HEAD>Iacocca Scores Sony Chairman's Criticism Of U.S. Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca on
Monday criticized Japan for maintaining what he called a ``rigged
market'' that owed much of its business success to restrictive
national trade policies.
   Iacocca, speaking to more than 600 members of the Magazine
Publishers Association and the American Society of Magazine
Editors, specifically complained about critical remarks by Akio
Morita, chairman of Sony Corp., in the recently published book,
``The Japan That Can Say No.''
   ``I resent like hell being lectured on fairness by a guy who got
to be a multibillionaire in our market _ wide open to him _ while
we were being systematically shut out of his,'' Iacocca said.
   ``The guy even has the audacity to say that American car
companies won't even try to sell in Japan. Well, we try alright,
but it's tough. I send a Jeep to Japan and the price goes up 70
(percent) to 90 percent.
   ``Japan is a rigged market ... If Morita didn't know any more
about electronics than he does about fairness, he'd still be trying
to figure out how to put together a crystal radio set.''
   The book, written by Morita and Shintaro Ishihara, a former
novelist, Cabinet minister and candidate for prime minister,
examines Japan's relations with the United States and the two
nations' frequent trade frictions.
   In the book, Morita argues that the United States must regain
the competitiveness its industries once enjoyed and scolds American
managers' short-sightedness. Ishihara contends that Japan
constantly capitulates to U.S. pressure and he blames racial
prejudice as the basis of U.S.-Japan friction.
   Iacocca urged U.S. business to halt the present system that
emphasizes short-term planning and encourages hostile takeovers. He
also suggested readjusting the capital gains tax to raise the levy
on short-term investments.
   ``The whole country seems to be in a short-term feeding
frenzy,'' said Iacocca. ``We really are strange people. We load up
on oat bran in the morning so we'll live forever, and then act all
day long like there is no tomorrow.''
   Iacocca also called for year-round school terms to keep U.S.
students competitive with their peers in other nations.
   Afterward, First Lady Barbara Bush called on the audience to
concentrate on fighting illiteracy.
   She said the inability to read and write can lead to drug abuse
and contributes to the nation's social problems.

<HEAD>Copper Hits Two-Month Low as Speculators Bail Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper speculators continued their flight from the weakening
market Monday, sending copper futures prices to their lowest levels
in more than two months on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   On other futures markets, heating oil plunged the
2-cents-a-gallon daily limit as energy futures sagged; stock-index
futures dropped along with stock prices; livestock and meat futures
were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Copper settled 0.2 cent to 4.5 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $1.196 a pound, its lowest daily close
since Aug. 16.
   The sell-off largely reflected selling by investment funds amid
indications that the market is shifting away from the tight-supply
situation that has existed since mid-summer.
   ``This was a complete continuation of fund liquidation,'' said
Tony Ellis, a broker with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New
York. ``It was one of the quieter days that I can remember as far
as trade business is concerned.''
   A fundamental backdrop for the market's decline was establshed
last week when miners at Canada's Highland Valley copper mine ended
a 3{-month strike and Mexican officials indicated that the Cananea
copper mine, that country's largest, would likely reopen soon after
a two-month shutdown.
   Analysts also traced Monday's weakness to the London Metal
Exchange's report that warehouse stocks of copper registered with
the exchange had shruken by 4,800 metric tons last week, a much
smaller decline than traders had expected.
   Precious metals futures edged lower on New York's Comex in dull
trading. Gold settled 30 cents to 50 cents lower with December at
$370.20 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.3 cent lower with
December at $5.138 a troy ounce.
   The sharp drop in oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange
was mainly a technical affair inspired by the November heating-oil
contract's dip below 60 cents a gallon, said Jerry Samuels, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Selling accelerated after crude oil futures broke through $20 a
barrel, a point of strong psychological support, he said.
   A trade journal's report of continued OPEC overproduction
prompted further selling.
   Heating oil for December delivery fell the 2-cent daily limit
while the limitless November contract plungged 2.02 cents a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 8 cents to 36 cents lower
with November at $18.59 a barrel; heating oil was 1.02 cents to
2.02 cents lower with November at 58.42 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.03 cents to 1.10 cents lower with November at 53.48
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with stock prices after last week's strong rally
showed signs of fading.
   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 2.50 points lower at 347.95.
Each point is worth $500.
   Cattle futures climbed on the Chicago Merc following Friday's
quarterly Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which
showed fewer cattle on feedlots than the market had expected.
   Hog futures also advanced while frozen pork bellies retreated
ahead of the USDA's monthly cold-storage report, which showed 32.8
million pounds of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of
Sept. 30 compared with 31.1 million pounds on the same date a year
earlier.
   Live cattle futures finished .15 cent to .45 cent higher with
December at 75.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .37
cent higher with October at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .82 cent higher with December at 47.62 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to .37 cent lower with February
at 52.57 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade with prices for near-month corn and wheat deliveries
supported by export demand and other contracts weakened by harvest
pressure.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to } cent higher with
December at $4.07} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2{ cents lower with
December at $2.41\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with December at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 2{

<HEAD>Mixed Bag for Oil Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Six major oil companies reported mixed quarterly results Monday,
mostly because of lower gasoline prices that hurt their refining
and marketing businesses.
   Earnings were down at Exxon Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co.,
Atlantic Richfield Co., and Ashland Oil Inc. reported a net loss.
Occidental Petroleum Corp. said earnings rose slightly. Amerada
Hess Corp., bucking the trend, said earnings more than doubled.
   Analysts said higher worldwide crude oil prices partly offset
weaker refining margins due to a fall in gasoline prices. Soaring
gasoline prices in the spring led to softer-than-expected demand
for gasoline during the peak summer travel season, hurting refining
and marketing profits for most companies.
   New York-based Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, said it
earned $1.1 billion or 87 cents a share in the third quarter ended
Sept. 30, down 9 percent from $1.2 billion or 93 cents a share a
year earlier. Revenue totaled $23.6 billion vs. $21.8 billion an 8
percent gain.
   For the first nine months, earnings fell 34.5 percent to $2.54
billion, or $1.99 a share, from $3.88 billion, or $2.89 a share.
The lower nine-month earnings reflected the company's provision for
the March 24 Alaska oil spill.
   Los Angeles-based Occidental earned $108 million or 39 cents a
share in the third quarter, up from $105 million or 38 cents a
share a year earlier. Revenue declined 2 percent to $4.8 billion
from $4.9 billion.
   Occidental's nine-month earnings dropped 14 percent to $255
million or 93 cents a share, compared with $295 million, or $1.23 a
share, in the same 1988 period. Revenue rose 6 percent to $15
billion from $14 billion.
   Phillips Petroleum's earnings dropped 60 percent to $87 million,
or 36 cents a share, from $215 million, or 89 cents a share a year
earlier. Revenue for the Bartlesville, Okla., company rose 7
percent to $3.1 billion from $2.9 billion.
   For the nine months, Phillips earned $474 million or $1.95 a
share, down 8 percent from $515 million or $2.17 a share a year
earlier. Revenue dropped 10 percent to $9.5 billion from $8.6
billion a year earlier.
   Los Angeles-based Arco earned $379 million, or $2.19 a share in
the quarter, down 3 percent from $391 million or $2.17 a share a
year earlier. Arco's revenue totaled $3.7 billion, down 20 percent
from $4.6 billion in the 1988 third quarter.
   Arco's nine-month earnings rose 33 percent to $1.6 billion, or
$8.87 share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $6.56 a share, a year
earlier, while revenue declined 13 percent to $12 billion from
$13.8 billion in 1988.
   Ashland Oil, reporting its fourth-quarter results, said it lost
$39.4 million or 71 cents a share due to previously announced
charges of $78 million. Revenue rose to $2.3 billion from $2.2
billion.
   For the fiscal year, Ashland's earnings totaled $86.2 million or
$1.55 a share, down from $224 million or $4.01 a share a year
earlier. Revenue grew about 4 percent to $8.5 billion from $8.2
billion as year ago.
   New York-based Amerada Hess's third-quarter earnings jumped to
$51.8 million, or 64 cents a share, from $15.8 million, or 20 cents
a share, reflecting much stronger refining and marketing segments
that bucked the general trend in the industry. The company also
benefited from unused tax credits of years past.
   The third-quarter results included a charge of $30 million,
associated with expenses from a refinery shutdown in the Virgin
Islands during Hurricane Hugo.
   Amerada Hess's third-quarter revenue rose to $1.2 billion, up 28
percent from $925 million in the same 1988 period.
   Amerada Hess' nine-month earnings jumped to $406 million, or
$4.99 a share, from $57.9 million, or 71 cents a share. Revenue
totaled $4 billion, up 35 percent from $3.1 billion in 1988.

   Oil futures prices fell in relatively light
trading Monday led by a sharp fall in heating oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
domestic heating oil finished 2.02 cents lower at 58.42 cents a
gallon and the contract for delivery in December closed at 58.84 a
gallon, down 2 cents.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery ended 1.03
cents lower at 53.48 cents a gallon, while the December contract
declined 1.10 cents to settled at 52.78 cents a gallon.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark grade of crude oil, lost 39 cents to close at $19.76 a
42-gallon barrel. January crude fell 36 cents to $19.59 a barrel
and February shed 31 cents to close at $19.44 a barrel.
   Analysts said volume remained light to moderate throughout the
session.
   An explosion and fire at Phillips Petroleum Co.'s Houston
chemical complex boosted prices only briefly, traders said.
   ``It lifted gasoline prices about 30 points but they came back
off,'' said Ann Shannon, trader at Elders Futures Inc. ``It was a
petrochemicals plant and shouldn't affect the market.''
   Energy brokers said the drop in heating oil was not unexpected,
given its strength in relation to crude oil and other market
segments.
   ``Heating oil got its just desserts,'' said Greg Dreis, energy
broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.

   UAL Corp. said Monday it will continue exploring
ways to get the best deal for its shareholders and indicated it may
not accept anything less than the $6.75 billion offered by a
labor-management group which failed to get financing for a buyout.
   In a vague statement, the parent of United Airlines said it
considered the failed bid's price of $300 a share to be ``an
attractive offer'' and ``in the best interests of shareholders.''
   ``Consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value, the
board will continue to explore all strategic and financial
alternatives available to the company,'' UAL said.
   ``However, the board has concluded that, at this time, the
welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the
broader public served by the airline can best be enhanced by
continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent
company.''
   The company issued the statement late in the day after a special
board meeting had ended.
   The statement also contained an ambiguous statement from UAL
Chairman Stephen Wolf, who had joined with the company's 7,000
pilots in leading the buyout group.
   Wolf said the cooperative effort had helped management and the
pilots to forge a ``substantially improved working relationship.''
But he made no mention in the statement of the group's recent
efforts to revise its offer.
   Wolf said he ``hopes that all 70,000 United employees can now
turn their full attention to operating the best airline in the
world.''
   Published reports had indicated the battered buyout group would
bring a new proposal to the board Monday while others said the
group wanted to secure financing before putting another offer on
the table.
   Spokespersons for United's parent UAL, the Air Line Pilots
Association and the flight attendants all declined comment on the
status of their efforts to put together another bid.
   A $300-a-share bid valued at $6.75 billion collapsed Oct. 13
when key banks refused to provide financing.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that the labor-managment group
was considering a revised offer that would give employees a
majority stake in UAL and leave some stock in public hands.
   The Journal said the group was seeking reactions to the new
deal, valued at $225 to $240 a share, or about $5.09 billion.
   The newspaper said the group did not plan to formally present
the scheme at the UAL board meeting but would seek binding
commitments from banks covering all the money needed to finance the
buyout before making a formal proposal.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune reported
that the employee-management group intended to submit a revised
proposal to the UAL board Monday.
   The offer for Chicago-based UAL will be in the range of $220 to
$250 a share, the newspapers said, quoting unidentified sources.
   The Association of Flight Attendants told its members in a
recorded phone-in message that any revised proposal ``will
obviously be considerably lower'' than the unsuccessful deal.
   The failure of the earlier bid helped trigger a 190-point plunge
in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13 and precipitated a
40 percent drop in UAL's stock price. UAL stock closed last Friday
at $168.50 a share.
   But the stock rebounded Monday morning as the board meeting
began and was trading at $182 at midday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The flight attendants joined the pilots and United's top
management in the bid on Thursday.
   The original deal would have given management and labor an 85
percent stake in UAL under the largest employee buyout in corporate
history. British Airways PLC, which pulled out of the buyout group
on Friday, would have taken a 15 percent ownership stake in return
for a $750 million investment.

<HEAD>Reports Loss for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Monday it lost $176
million in the third quarter due to huge expenses associated with
its acquisition of a controlling interest in Warner Communications
Inc.
   The loss amounted to $2.88 per share on revenue of $2.2 billion.
   A year ago, Time alone earned $81 million, or $1.42 a share, on
revenue of $1.13 billion.
   Those figures are not directly comparable, however, with the
latest results reflecting Time's acquisition in late July of 100
million shares of Warner stock, boosting its stake in Warner to
59.3 percent. The latest results also reflect a pro-rated share of
Warner's earnings for August and September.
   For the first nine months of the year, the newly configured
entertainment and media giant known now as Time Warner lost $33
million, or 56 cents per share, on revenue of $4.5 billion.
   Time alone earned $231 million, or $4 a share, on revenue of
$3.3 billion a year ago.
   The Time Warner loss in the latest quarter reflects a jump in
interest expense to $451 million from $25 million for Time alone in
1988, as well as depreciation and amortization charges of $155
million compared with $55 million a year earlier.
   The company said that for purposes of discussion, it computed
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for
the new company.
   Under that method, it said its pro-forma earnings amounted to
$526 million for the quarter, up from $242 million a year earlier,
and to $1.52 billion for the nine months, up from $999 million.
   Magazine division earnings on a pro-forma basis fell to $41
million in the latest quarter from $47 million a year earlier, as
advertising revenues were flat.
   The filmed entertainment division had pro-forma earnings of $103
million in the quarter in contrast to a loss of $123 million last
year, reflecting the success of ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon II.''
   On the same pro-forma basis, Time Warner's recorded music and
music publishing division earned $108 million, up from $92 million
a year earlier, and cable division earnings rocketed to $166
million from $94 million.
   Time Warner expects to complete the acquisition of the remaining
shares of Warner stock later this year, paying for a package that
includes preferred stock and Warner's holdings in a subsidiary of
Chris-Craft Industries Inc.

<HEAD>Boeing Chairman: No Increase in Money to Settle Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. will not offer any more money to
settle a three-week strike by production workers despite mounting
and ``irreparable'' losses, Chairman Frank Shrontz told reporters
Monday.
   Earlier Monday, Tom Baker, president of District Lodge 751 of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
said the strike could not be settled without a bigger money offer.
   The separate news conferences, including the first by Shrontz in
the dispute, appeared to mark a hardening of positions in the 20th
day of a walkout at the world's largest commercial airplane
manufacturer.
   Four hours of talks Wednesday were the first since union members
voted by an 85 percent margin to strike rather than accept the
company's a three-year offer.
   That offer included annual pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percent
and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year
and 3 percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover
inflation; a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher
benefits.
   No further talks were scheduled. The Machinists represent 57,800
Boeing workers nationwide, including 43,300 in the local district,
12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred
at scattered sites in other states.
   At Wichita, a non-union Boeing worker and two others were
released on bond after being arrested early Saturday in the firing
of a shotgun at the union's strike headquarters. Pellets hit the
building, parked cars and a sign, but no one was injured. Sedgwick
County sheriff's deputies said charges could be filed within 14
days.
   Picketing has been generally quiet in the Seattle area.
   The last paychecks for work done before the walkout were mailed
by Boeing last week. The first union strike payments of a flat $100
per week per member are set for distribution Thursday.
   Baker said union members were adamant about getting a bigger
financial package, with less than 1 percent crossing picket lines
and fewer total crossing than in the last Boeing strike, in 1977.
   At his news conference, Shrontz maintained the package was the
best in recent U.S. industrial history and said any boost would
jeopardize Boeing's competitive position.
   ``We're not prepared to increase the offer,'' Shrontz said.
   Shrontz said he hoped the dispute would not jeopardize Boeing's
long-term labor relations, generally regarded as among the best in
the aerospace industry.
   ``I don't think I've drawn a line that is unreasonable,'' he
said.
   Contacted by telephone after Shrontz spoke, Baker said he didn't
consider that the company's last word.
   ``They have their own timing on when they want to settle the
strike,'' the union leader said, adding that he did not know what
that timetable might be.
   Shrontz said Boeing already faced unspecified losses, including
sales, on which he gave no figures or other indication of magnitude.
   ``We certainly are not ignoring this strike. We certainly want
to see it settled as soon as possible,'' Shrontz said. ``I think
our losses are irreparable already.''
   Meanwhile, contract talks with Boeing's second-largest union,
the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, were
set to resume Tuesday and continue through the week, said Robbi
Miner of the unaffiliated union.

<HEAD>OSHA Issues Citations, Fine Against Cargill Poultry-Processing Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency on Monday announced citations
against Cargill Inc.'s Buena Vista, Ga., poultry-processing plant,
alleging 113 willful violations of federal safety and health
standards.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also proposed
a $242,000 fine against Cargill over the alleged violations.
   Gerard Scannell, OSHA's assistant secretary of labor, said the
plant did not implement controls to reduce cumulative trauma
disorders in its workers. The disorders, known as CDTs, include
carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis.
   Greg Lauser, a spokesman at Minneapolis, Minn.,-based Cargill,
said the company plans to contest the citations and fine.
   ``At this time OSHA has not discussed the detailed factual
findings of its investigation,'' he said, reading from a statement.
``Therefore, the company will contest the proposed citation and
fine so it can review OSHA's findings.''
   CDTs result from constant repetition of awkward or forced hand
and arm action and result in aching wrists and numb fingers and
hands. In some cases, permanent damage can be caused to tendons,
nerves and muscles.
   OSHA records indicate 90 percent of the Buena Vista plant's 500
employees work at tasks that expose them to risk from CDTs.
   ``We believe the pervasiveness of CDT in the plant, affecting
upwards of an estimated two-thirds of Cargill employees, and the
lack of a concerted effort by the company to implement corrective
actions justify the multi-instance penalties,'' Scannell said.
   OSHA found 111 CDT violations and cited the plant for not having
an effective program to battle CDTs and for failing to provide
employees' medical records.
   Lauser said the company ``has made serious good-faith efforts to
address CDT problems,'' including hiring medical experts and
providing job rotations.

<HEAD>West Virginia Charges Five Investment Houses With Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Virginia charged five New
York-based investment houses with fraud and conspiracy Monday over
the loss of $279 million in the state consolidated investment fund
in 1987-89.
   The suit, filed in Kanwha County Circuit Court, came after the
state obtained a related injunction against the five firms and
three others.
   The injunction was sought after five of the brokerage houses
filed suit in New York on Friday to prevent the state from suing
them in a West Virginia court. A hearing on the New York petition
is scheduled for Tuesday in New York.
   The legal actions amounted to pre-emptive strikes by both sides
as they maneuver on the complicated issues of whether the brokerage
firms are responsible for trading losses that the state suffered
primarily in April-June 1987 in the consolidated investment fund.
The losses led to the resignation of state Treasurer A. James
Manchin.
   The five brokerage houses did not believe they were responsible
for any trading losses in the fund nor were they liable for
damages, Attorney General Roger W. Tompkins told the state Board of
Investments, which oversees the fund.
   The five are Salomon Brothers Inc.; Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc;
Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.; and County
NatWest Government Securities Inc.
   Tompkins filed a 69-page legal action against the five Monday
evening in Kanawha County Circuit Court, charging them in a
10-count civil action with actions that were ``reckless, willful,
wanton and malicious and exhibited conscious indifference to their
consequences.''
   Before the five sued the state, Tompkins warned them they would
be arguing their case before a West Virginia jury. Shortly
thereafter, they sued in New York court to prevent the state from
suing them in West Virginia court.
   As a result of that suit, West Virginia filed suit Monday in
Kanawha County against the five, plus Chase Securities Inc.;
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Citibank; and Merrill Lynch Pierce
Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.
   The latter three were added to preclude them from filing action
in New York, officials at the attorney general's office said.
   Tompkins said Kanawha County Circuit Judge A. Andrew MacQueen
issued a preliminary injunction on the state's petition to halt the
eight from filing legal action to prevent the state from suing
them. He said the suit and countersuit means the two sides are at a
legal standstill.
   Tompkins later Molnday filed the new suit, which seeks
unspecified damage against the investment houses for their handling
of state investments in the loss period of 1987-89. It charged the
companies with fraud, conspiracy, negligence, violation of
financial trust and illegal speculative trading.
   The fund lost $279 million directly and up to $340 million when
future interest losses are included, according to a report by a
special prosecutor.
   The fund, comprised of money from state, county and municipal
governments, was invested by the treasurer's office.
