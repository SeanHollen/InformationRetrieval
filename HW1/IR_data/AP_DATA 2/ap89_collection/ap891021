   The release of seven African
Congress National leaders from prison has been welcomed in black
townships nationwide, but there is no sign of a thaw between the
guerrilla group and its black political rivals.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the most powerful black moderate in South
Africa, complained the ANC wants to project itself as the sole
representative of the country's blacks.
   ``I shudder to think what would happen to South Africa if we all
stood aside and allowed only one black party to negotiate the
future with the government,'' Buthelezi said Thursday.
   Buthelezi, a critic of the ANC's socialist ideology and its
bombing and sabotage campaign, is chief minister of the tribal
homeland of KwaZulu. He also is leader of Inkatha, a Zulu
organization that claims 1.5 million members and which has feuded
violently in the past three years with supporters of the ANC.
   More than 2,000 blacks in Natal Province have died in the
conflict, and recent efforts to promote peace talks have collapsed.
   Also remaining at odds with the ANC is the outlawed Pan
Africanist Congress. Both groups have conducted guerrilla
operations against the government in the past three decades, but
the Pan Africanist Congress is smaller, has been less active and
has sharp ideological differences with the ANC.
   The ANC follows a policy of non-racialism and welcomes whites in
its ranks. The Pan Africanist Congress espouses the ``black
consciousness'' philosophy pioneered by Steve Biko before his death
in detention in 1977, and believes whites should have no role in
the struggle for black rights.
   One Pan Africanist Congress member, Jafta Masemola, was released
from prison Oct. 14 along with the seven ANC leaders. But he stayed
out of the spotlight at his home near Pretoria while the ANC men
held a triumphant news conference that was covered by journalists
from around the world.
   In subsequent interviews, Masemola, 60, said he foresaw no
likelihood of his group and the ANC uniting. Unlike the ANC
leaders, he said there was no purpose in pursuing negotiations with
the government, calling them ``an exercise in futility'' because
the ruling National Party would not negotiate itself out of power.
   The leader of the Pan Africanist Congress, Zeph Mothopeng, was
freed from prison last year. He met during the week with Walter
Sisulu, the most senior of the freed ANC prisoners, but has given
no indication of an ideological rapprochement between the two
groups.
   Earlier this month, Mothopeng even criticized the campaign of
protest marches organized by anti-apartheid groups aligned with the
ANC.
   He said President F.W. de Klerk had gained favorable publicity
overseas by allowing the marches, and asked: ``How much closer to
liberation did they bring the oppressed?''
   Both Mothopeng and Buthelezi have sought to avoid portraying
themselves as personal rivals of Nelson Mandela, the paramount ANC
leader who remains in jail. Buthelezi has depicted Mandela as his
friend and said repeatedly that he will not enter political
negotiations with the government until Mandela is freed.

   From classic elegance at Givenchy to skin-tight and
slinky jerseys at Tarlazzi, styles in Friday's fashion shows for
next summer ran the gamut.
   Tailored, ruffled, draped, and bare-midriff looks took over the
runways as the fashion picture was unfocused.
   Givenchy had his act together, a sophisticated range of clothes
that looked worthy of the elder statesman of couture.
   But the clothes were far from elderly. Givenchy simply took some
of his favorite themes and brought them out in luxurious fabrics.
He firmly padded shoulders for shape, ignoring the softer shoulders
elsewhere. There were lots of short skirts and easy long pants, in
plaid or solid suits with fitted or bolero tops. The suits were
handsome in windowpane plaids, stripes or glen plaids in silks,
linens and cottons.
   Simple sheaths with big padded cap sleeves or off-the-shoulder
banded tops with huge puffy sleeves over narrow short skirts added
to the range of feminine silhouettes for summer.
   There were navy, gray and neutrals for daytime, with sizzling
colors for later on. They came out in gazar or organza outfits with
big flounces, flowered prints, shades of orange, pink, wisteria and
turquoise, sometimes decorated with lily-of-the valley appliques or
sparkly fish just for fun.
   Karl Lagerfeld's ideas oozed with originality, all the clothes
cut for action from striped knit pullovers, long pants and shorts
to the fluid, full-skirted minis.
   Borrowing some of his own ideas from Chanel, where he's also
head designer, Lagerfeld sometimes paired big tweed checked blazers
with dark chiffon culottes and long skirts.
   Jackets were the forte, and whether short or long, they were
always fitted to the waist, and often had deeply cut lapels,
hugging the hips over contrasting short and lean skirts with
matching tights or the new, full minis. The best jacket had
crescent-shaped lapels _ one large, one small _ and for evening it
came out with pearled embroidery.
   Lagerfeld's prettiest cocktail clothes paired up black and white
short looks in bustier outfits with revealing black lace loose
jackets.
   Folklore and graphic prints with sequins and big polka-dotted
satins and cottons looked great too. Lagerfeld mixed them up in
tiny minis with fitted jackets, or in long, high-waisted pyjamas
and short or cutaway jackets.
   ``Come play with me,'' declared Angelo Tarlazzi in his program.
The Italian designer, who now also plies his trade for Guy Laroche
couture, went all out for hot-colored and clingy knits, leaving
little to the imagination. With elastic shoulder wraps, many bare
midriffs, pleated ruffles at the bust or hem, some of the viscose
knits were convertible _ and could be pulled out from mini length
to make a long dress.
   The most amusing evening dresses were called ``totems,'' and
combined bubbles of African-inspired prints in hot colors and black
with raffia fringes and fishnet hems.
   To emphasize the waist, he gave a girdle effect in lame
waist-cinchers to many outfits, with fullness in blouses above and
long pants or shorts below.
   Tarlazzi raided the linen closet for his ideas in summer white:
hem-stitched jackets and flounced skirts with boleros were a great
exercise in what you can do with sheets, napkins and tablecloths.
   Anne-Marie Beretta's daytime suits with mother of pearl buttons
or snaps on long jackets worn with pedal pushes or pleated skirts
looked a bit too strict for the pampered set that frequents the
Automobile Club, where the show was held.
   The outfits were better in light pastel linens, forest green and
petrol blue than in the rather sad shades of khaki, putty and muddy
brown that predominated.
   She draped lots of clothes rather awkwardly for daytime, giving
them a heavy look in front. But some of the taffeta and lace
evening drapes and big ruffles were opulent if not especially
feminine.
   Woodstock was reborn for Bernard Perris, who went back to the
1960s and '70s for his inspiration. His girls trotted out in
flared, funnel-shaped trousers, lots of embroidered and jeweled
hipster pants and skirts, and fringes all over the place.
   He also harked back to the age of Aquarius in his mixed Indian
cotton and silk prints in wrapped and draped skirts and
cummerbunds. And his idea of the tuxedo got all dressed up with
acres of long tassels.
   Bellbottomed pants, jumpsuits and shorts came out at Chloe, the
collection designed by Martine Sitbon. Her black pants suits or
short skirts with cutaway jackets were stitched with white, giving
nice vertical lines all over.
   The many cut-outs, bareback and bare-midriff outfits gave
another nod to the 1960s in this group of shows that seems to be
floundering as designers search for details and silhouettes for the
1990s.

<TEXT>
   Japan has become the most earthquake-conscious
nation in the world since the earth shook in 1923 and destroyed
Tokyo, but the next great quake probably will be a human and
economic disaster despite all precautions.
   Tokyo had 2 million people when the earthqake struck. Now 12
million people live in the city and the nation is a pillar of
finance, with world's richest stock exchange and the most money
flowing out to international capital markets.
   Predictions about the next great earthquake _ it's due about
1993 if calculations of a 70-year cycle are correct _ include
casualties in tens of thousands and a setback for the world as
Japanese money stays home to rebuild.
   A lot is being done to lessen the effect. More new buildings are
resistant to earthquakes and the fires temblors often cause, and 13
million people took part in the last national disaster-prevention
drill in September.
   Japan is a world leader in earthquake engineering. Newer
buildings are designed not to collapse even in a quake registering
about 8 on the Richter scale, said Shinsuke Nakata, a design code
specialist in the Construction Ministry.
   Japanese and U.S. codes follow different philosophies, Nakata
said: a tendency to rigid construction in Japan, while California
emphasizes improved ``margin of deformability'' in building codes
that are ``much more sophisticated.''
   After the California quake Tuesday, Japanese experts went to the
San Francisco Bay area to study why one structure collapsed and
another stood, what the soil conditions were and other aspects of
the disaster.
   If Tokyo's new skyscrapers perform as well as those in San
Francisco, most of the damage will occur elsewhere.
   Some experts believe Japan is doing some things wrong, however,
and that the inevitable great quake will be more costly as a result.
   A fundamental problem is the dense Tokyo area megalopolis of
close to 30 million people, nearly one-quarter of the national
population. The archipelago is in the world's most active seismic
zone, a meeting place of four tectonic plates.
   Japan and the surrounding seabed experience about 10 percent of
global earthquake action, the government says, and Tokyo is on a
particularly active site even by Japanese standards.
   Although residents of the city feel several quakes a year of low
to medium intensity, experts say this is a quiet time.
   Since a strong quake nearby in 1929, ``Tokyo has not experienced
a single tremor with an intensity of 5 or more,'' Katsuhiko
Ishibashi, a seismologist with the Construction Ministry, wrote in
1987.
   On the Japanese intensity scale he cited, 5 is a ``very strong''
quake just below the disastrous level. The great quake of Sept. 1,
1923, which caused 140,000 deaths in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama, was
a 7, the top of that scale.
   No direct conversion is possible between the Japanese scale and
the open-ended Richter, which was developed later, but the 1923
Tokyo quake was estimated to have had a 7.9 Richter reading; the
1906 San Francisco earthquake was estimated at 8.3.
   Ishibashi and other Japanese scientists have focused on a
volcanic eruption in 1986 on Oshima Island, 70 miles south of
Tokyo, as evidence of deadly seismic activity on the way.
   If history repeats itself, the next focus would be Odawara, 40
miles south of Tokyo, and after that a great earthquake is likely
``toward the end of this century'' in the heavily populated Tokai
region a bit farther south, he wrote.
   These quakes ``are also likely to inaugurate an extended period
of frequent and destructive earthquakes directly under Tokyo Bay,''
he said.
   Ishibashi said Japan must decentralize away from Tokyo and the
Kanto Plain on which it sits. He urged national leaders ``to find a
way of freeing ourselves from Tokyo's magnetic pull and steering
Japan clear of tragedy.''
   His article in the monthly Chuo Koron monthly said it was folly
to proceed with plans for Tokyo that put strong emphasis on
building artificial islands in the bay to house several million
people.
   Because of a phenomenon called liquefaction, landfill can turn
into something like quicksand in a big earthquake, magnifying
ground motion and damage, he wrote, ``even if buildings, bridges
and highways themselves are of earthquake-resistant or
vibration-free design.''
   Some of the worst damage in San Francisco this week was in the
Marina district, built on landfill.
   After the San Francisco quake, Japanese TV viewers saw long
programs on disaster measures at home, often including maps of
Tokyo showing large areas already built on landfill and prone to
liquefaction.
   Last year, city authorities calculated the loss if Tokyo were
hit by a quake as strong as the 1923 disaster, especially on a
winter evening when cooking stoves and gas heaters were in use.
   The estimate was 37,000 dead, 78,000 injured, one-third of homes
and offices destroyed and massive disruption to communications and
power supplies.
   A study by the National Land Agency put the toll much higher:
150,000 dead and 200,000 injured.
   Tokai Bank of Nagoya calculated such a quake would cause damage
valued at $570 billion, or about 20 percent of Japan's economic
output.
   It predicted the flow of capital to the United States would be
cut in half, causing U.S. interest rates to rise and stock markets
to plunge, worsening Third World debt problems and threatening a
world depression.
   Some Japanese are fatalistic about the impending disaster. One
survey showed 94 percent of businesses thought they needed backup
computer systems, but only 9.5 percent had them.
   ``You can't do anything about it,'' a Foreign Ministry official
said. ``Que sera, sera.''

   Of the entire 8.5-mile span of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, only about 50 feet is not where it
belongs.
   But that is all the difference in the world.
   ``Ninety-five percent of the bridge worked,'' said Greg Bayol, a
spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.
   Officials estimate it will take about four weeks to repair two
sections of the bridge damaged in Tuesday's earthquake and reopen
the span to the 270,000 vehicles that cross back and forth each day.
   ``One month sounds awful ambitious,'' conceded Bob Halligan,
spokesman for transportation department. ``We may get in there and
find something else.''
   One person died in the collapse, a 23-year-old Berkeley woman
whose car sped over the edge moments after the gap opened.
   Initial work is planned for this weekend, when a huge crane will
lower the 250-ton section of the upper roadway more than 100 feet
to a barge in the bay.
   On Friday, crews prepared the damaged section, working in stiff
37 mph winds, biting temperatures and a light fog.
   The five-lane-wide chunk of roadway slumps at a terrifying angle
toward the water, which is visible through a savage slice cut into
the lower level by the falling edge.
   Workers operated small vehicles and cables just a few feet from
the edge, defiant of wind gusts and the choppy gray water below.
   Since the accident, workers have hoisted pennants on the upper
span in the black-and-gold colors of the San Francisco Giants and
green and yellow of the Oakland A's, the cross-bay rivals meeting
in the delayed World Series.
   Reporters were allowed to tour the bridge Friday, but could not
talk to workers.
   One project manager, however, volunteered that the repair work
would be unique.
   ``We've never done anything exactly like this,'' said Doug
Comstock of the Smith Rice Co. of Oakland, which is removing the
damaged section.
   The company's No. 5 barge and its crane capable of hoisting 400
tons were already in place Friday afternoon.
   Once the bridge section is on the barge, officials said, it will
be taken to Alameda for study and, if possible, repairs.
   Jim Roberts, chief of structures for the state transportation
department, said the damaged section appears to be in good shape.
If it can be salvaged, it will be put back in place as soon as
possible, he said.
   ``It will be upgraded to today's technology,'' he said.
   The top section fell when its anchor bolts were sheared off by
more than 2 million pounds of pressure, Roberts said at a news
conference Friday.
   That was ``far in excess of what anyone calculated when it was
designed in the early '30s,'' he said.
   The bolts were sheared by the movement of a column that supports
the bridge, Bayol said.
   ``The tower shifted,'' Bayol said.
   The tower is structurally sound, although workers will have to
use winches and cables to push it three to five inches back into
place, he said.
   The bottom section of the two-tiered bridge suffered three
puncture holes, opening portions of the roadway to the water below,
Bayol said.
   It may be possible to repair that section while it remains in
place, Bayol said. Roberts said it could also be replaced by a
prefabricated section.
   Total repair cost is estimated at $1 million, Halligan said.
   Asked what the biggest potential problem was in the rebuilding,
Bayol deadpanned: ``Earthquake.''
   Severed light cables and communication lines for bridge workers
will also have to be repaired.
   ATT's coaxial telephone cable, normally capable of handling
1,200 phone calls simultaneously, was bent, and that traffic has
been permanently rerouted to other lines, said AT&amp;T spokesman Ron
Beagley.
   The bridge closure is expected to cause havoc with the local
traffic. Even with many businesses closed Friday, traffic was
bumper to bumper on other bridges.

   Three Hill Air Force Base security
policemen pleaded innocent Friday to charges stemming from a
three-year federal undercover operation into thefts and illegal
sales of military property.
   The three appeared before U.S. Magistrate Ronald Boyce two days
after their arrests by agents of the FBI, the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service and the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations.
   They were among nine people charged in sealed indictments handed
up Oct. 13 by a federal grand jury in Ogden.
   Another 12 people were charged earlier in a separate sealed
indictment handed up by a Salt Lake grand jury in the wake of the
undercover investigation called Operation Punchout.
   Sgt. Robert Todd Young, 23, of Orting, Wash., was indicted on 12
counts of theft of property ranging from helmets and survival
knives to clothing and ammunition.
   Boyce released Young, who lives off-base with his wife, on a
$2,500 signature bond with a $250 cash deposit and ordered him to
return to duty Monday.
   Airman 1st Class Robin James Olson, 21, of Missoula, Mont.,
charged with seven counts of stealing helmets and clothing, was
released on a $2,500 bond and restricted to base.
   Sgt. Gregory Lewis Hawley, 27, of Columbus, Ohio, is charged
with a single count of theft of night observation devices. He was
released on his own recognizance and confined to base.
   Operation Punchout involved FBI agents posing as operators of a
mock military surplus store. The probe netted an assortment of
government munitions and equipment, including three F-16 jet
engines valued at about $2 million each.
   Two airmen at the base pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges they
stole the engines and sold them to undercover agents. Under a plea
bargain, additional charges will be dropped against Airman 1st
Class Brian David Roth, 22, of Chesterland, Ohio, and Senior Airman
Danny Joe Stroud, 24, of Newton, Kan., when they are sentenced Dec.
12.
   Two other Hill servicemen have been acquitted by military courts
of charges they unlawfully sold government property.
   Federal and Air Force investigators expect to charge more than
100 people in the probe, according to U.S. Attorney Dee Benson.
   In all, about 20 indictments have been handed up, including the
nine last week in Ogden. Not all of those charged have been
arrested.

   A woman convicted with her
religious sect-leader husband of sexually exploiting teen-age boys
was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison.
   Colleen Randazzo ``has repeatedly exploited children for her own
sexual gratification and that of those around her,'' Mesa County
District Judge David Bottger said in sentencing her on eight felony
convictions.
   Supplying teen-agers with cocaine, having sex with them and
videotaping the sessions ``is not casual or inadvertent acts,''
Bottger said. ``I watched that videotape and I didn't see any love
or affection at all. All I saw was sex.
   ``The only reason she doesn't have any other felony convictions
is because her conduct was not detected and prosecuted sooner,''
the judge said.
   Bottger allowed Mrs. Randazzo, 38, to go free on $80,000 bond
pending her appeal.
   On the 1{-hour videotape, Mrs. Randazzo's husband, James, is
seen lying naked next to his wife and the teen-age boy as they have
sex. He called out direction, made requests of them and fondled
himself.
   The Randazzos were leaders of a group called the Spiral of
Friends, a Christianity-based cult whose five or six dozen members
believed that James Randazzo had reached the ``highest level of
spirituality since Jesus Christ,'' according to testimony.
   The Mesa County probation office had recommended a sentence of
90 days in jail, followed by probation, for Mrs. Randazzo, who had
faced up to 66 years in prison.
   Bottger said he couldn't agree because Mrs. Randazzo's conduct
had not constituted an isolated incident and because she had not
expressed remorse or acknowleged that what she did was wrong.
   He sentenced her to two consecutive terms of four years each.
Under state law, she will probably serve four years.
   Her 50-year-old husband, James, was convicted of 10 charges and
also was to be sentenced Friday. However, his attorney was unable
to be present, and his sentencing was rescheduled for Jan. 26. He
faces up to 130 years in prison.
   Mrs. Randazzo's attorney, Robert Flynn, said he would base his
appeal on the admissibility of the videotape and the court's
refusal to allow her to use a ``choice of evils'' defense.
   Mrs. Randazzo had contended that she engaged in sex with the boy
in the videotape because he was depressed and needed to have his
self-esteem boosted.
   Bottger, however, said her case ``is not a case of religion ...
or of therapy, or kindness or affection or love.''

   The traumatic rescue of a 6-year-old boy
from the rubble of Tuesday's earthquake has become a focal point of
sympathy and good will from his classmates, his city and his
president.
   Julio Berumen lost his right leg after doctors had to cut
through the body of his dead mother to free him from the family car
trapped in a freeway collapse.
   The Richmond boy was in serious but stable condition Friday. His
8-year-old sister, Cathy, was in fair condition with head injuries
suffered in the crash.
   While the children's father, Pastor, waited for further word
about his children, news of Tuesday's rescue had spread.
   By Friday, Children's Hospital officials said there was even
some discussion about a presidential bedside visit.
   President Bush did meet Friday with Dr. Jim Betts, who performed
the surgery on the boy while lying on his stomach on a board which
had been pushed into a narrow opening in the wreckage.
   The hospital had received hundreds of calls by Friday from
around the country expressing support for the family. People
stopped at the front desk to bring toys. Some of them were in tears.
   Hospital officials said the elder Berumen was aware of the
attention his family had attracted, but wanted to stay out of the
spotlight.
   ``He's vey much in touch with this, but in his grief, he has
asked everyone to leave,'' said hospital spokesman Dennis Green.
   Green said Berumen had been at the hospital almost constantly
since the accident and was being supported by relatives, friends
and hospital counselors.
   The rescue, to many people, brought the earthquake very close to
home.
   ``It really brings it (the earthquake) to a personal level,''
said Antonieta Franco, Cathy's teacher. ``The whole family was very
close. The mother was devoted to her children. She dropped them off
at school and picked them up in the morning.''
   Now, the mother was dead after being killed instantly when a
pillar on the freeway sliced through her car.
   Cathy was pried from the car soon after rescuers reached it, but
Julio was pinned. The mother lay between the rescuers and the boy.
Doctors decided they had no choice but to saw through the seat and
the body to get to Julio.
   Then came the decision to amputate the boy's leg.
   ``I'd do it again,'' Betts said afterwards. ``I knew if I was up
there or one of my family members were up there, I'd want them to
do it.''
   The story of the rescue, which took more than four hours, has
stirred neighbors and friends who have organized two funds to help
the family.
   And the memory of it will serve as a reminder for many of the
children's classmates long after the last aftershock fades.
   ``It's going to be hard for the kids in my class to forget about
it (the earthquake) after something like this.'' Ms. Franco said.

   Wealthy businessman Del Dunmire has
given hundreds of thousands in donations over the years, but his
$50,000 gift to the city of Abilene, Kan., had a special meaning.
   In 1958, Dunmire robbed the Commercial State Bank in Abilene.
   He was caught, convicted and sent to prison, serving two years
before being paroled. After his release, Dunmire borrowed $3,000 to
start Growth Industries, the aviation parts company that became the
source of his wealth.
   The gift to Abilene will help rebuild a bandstand destroyed by
fire.
   The robbery 31 years ago netted Dunmire $2,261.

   Kathrine Rice strutted slowly down the runway at a
charity fashion show, sashaying this way and that to show off the
white beaded-lace sheath she wore.
   But the once-aspiring actress demurred when anyone suggested
that at age 95, she looked radiantly beautiful.
   ``I was just doing my job. The dress did a lot,'' said Rice, who
dispatches questions about her marital status with a snappy: ``Just
plain Rice, never married.''
   Rice was among a bevy of models over 40 who presented evening
wear and furs at a fund-raiser Friday for Reading is Fundamental, a
non-profit organization.
   Rice said that years ago she planned a career on the stage and
played bit parts in the Provincetown Players on Cape Cod, which
gave playwright Eugene O'Neill his start.
   She got a toehold in the pictures, playing extras. But other
obligations brought down the curtain on those dreams and she
returned to Boston to help in the family tie-manufacturing business.
   Friday she returned to the spotlight.
   Her thoughts? ``I was nervous.''

scheduled for tonight and Sunday. Rose made the apology Thursday at
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after complaining out loud on
stage Wednesday that he was going to quit because of excessive drug
use in the group.
   ``I just didn't want to see my friends slip away,'' Rose
explained.
   The Los Angeles band, which has sold more than 12 million albums

   Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on
the moon, is joining the board of directors of Thiokol Corp., whose
rocket was blamed in the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger.
   Armstrong and several other directors were elected Thursday in
the first shareholders' meeting of the company since the separation
of Morton Thiokol Inc. into Thiokol and Morton International Inc.
in July.
   The explosion of Challenger was blamed on a faulty O-ring seal
on one of the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets, which were
built by Morton Thiokol. Seven astronauts died in the explosion.
   Thiokol was involved in the redesign of the rockets and since
the redesign there have been six successful missions, U. Edwin
Garrison, chief executive officer of the company, told shareholders.

   Paul Tibbets said he had a job to do
Aug. 6, 1945, when he dropped the first atomic bomb in battle.
   And if he had to, he would do it again.
   ``Nothing like regret ever entered my mind,'' said Tibbets,
pilot of the Enola Gay. ``It was something that we were supposed to
do to defeat the enemy. That was the name of the game.''
   The bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed or injured 160,000, but
Tibbets said the loss of life would have been much greater if the
United States had been forced to invade the Japanese mainland.
   ``The Japanese would have resisted an invasion with every man,
woman and child,'' Tibbets said Thursday. ``If necessary, they
would have used sticks and stones in defense. It would have been
bloody beyond imagination.''
   Tibbetts, a 74-year-old retired brigadier general, was here for

   Sister Isolina Ferre, a 75-year-old Roman
Catholic missionary, won the $10,000 Albert Schweitzer Prize for
Humanitarianism for her work with the poor in Appalachia, New York
and Puerto Rico.
   ``Over the years, in Puerto Rico, in Appalachia, in the Navy
Yard section of Brooklyn, I had come to realize that violence among
youth or in neighborhoods had an important relationship to family,
community, and employment,'' Ferre said after receiving the award
Friday. ``If family and community could be strengthened, and
meaningful employment made available, I was convinced that we might
make substantial progress in the struggle against neighborhood
crime and violence.''
   Ferre mediated between black and Puerto Rican youth gangs and
New York's juvenile justice system in the late 1950s and 1960s.
   In 1969, she returned to her native Puerto Rico where she
founded a community-based youth training program.
   The prize, established in 1986, is named for the Alsatian
medical missionary, theologian and musician, Dr. Albert Schweitzer
(1875-1965) and is administered by The Johns Hopkins University.

<HEAD>Investigator Said to Find No Grounds for Further Gingrich Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary investigation of Rep. Newt
Gingrich is nearing its end with an apparent conclusion by an
outside attorney that there are no grounds for a full-fledged
ethics probe of the No. 2 House Republican leader, Capitol Hill
sources say.
   But the final answer on whether the Georgia Republican is off
the hook on ethics charges will await the outcome of some ``loose
ends,'' which will be looked into by the House ethics committee's
own staff investigators.
   Chicago attorney William Kunkle, representing the firm hired as
outside counsel to look into the Gingrich matter, completed a
three-month, $150,000 investigation and gave his findings to the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct on Wednesday, the
sources said.
   The panel could act on Gingrich's case as early as its expected
meeting next week.
   But Democratic and Republican sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Kunkle also gave the panel questions that remained
unanswered and will have to be pursued by the committee's own staff
before final disposition of the case.
   One source said some of the questions could be important,
adding: ``There's a lot of loose money out there. It will be a
close call'' on whether to drop the case.
   Some of the questions involve what was done by the publisher to
promote sales of a book Gingrich wrote, ``Window of Opportunity,''
one source said.
   Kunkle is a partner in Phelan, Pope and John, the same Chicago
law firm that investigated former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas. Wright resigned May 31. Gingrich filed the complaint that
led to the opening of Wright's ethics case, and has said his
current problems are the result of Democratic vindictiveness rather
than any wrongdoing on his part.
   Gingrich said Friday he did not know what was in the report, but
he called for it to be released publicly. He also said he had not
been contacted by the ethics committee.
   ``I haven't seen it. We have no idea what it says and we're
waiting for the committee to finish its work and we'll continue to
cooperate with the committee,'' Gingrich said. ``When it's all
done, I'm sure they will release it.''
   Gingrich is the minority whip, the second-ranking post in the
House Republican leadership.
   The case stems from a complaint by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.,
that Gingrich violated House rules and federal campaign finance
laws with a limited partnership created in 1984 to promote the
book, which Gingrich wrote with his wife and another co-author.
   Alexander's complaint focuses on a partnership of 21 individuals
who each put up to $5,000 to promote the book. Gingrich was not an
investor, but his wife was paid more than $10,000 for running the
partnership.
   The complaint contended the $105,000 raised by the partnership
could be considered income to Gingrich, in violation of House
limits on members' outside earnings. If not income, the complaint
said, it could be a gift to Gingrich, in violation of House rules
that prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than $100
from anyone with a direct interest in legislation.

<HEAD>State Says Reports of I-880 Problems Were No Cause For Alarm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of problems noted by inspectors
of an Oakland freeway over the years gave no hint of its disastrous
collapse during a major earthquake, a top California transportation
official contends.
   The periodic maintenance and repair reports described a sagging
deck, cracks, flaking concrete, bent spans, a cracked girder and
other problems since the Cypress viaduct opened in 1957.
   But the reports on the double-deck Nimitz freeway section that
collapsed and crushed dozens of drivers were ``no cause for
alarm,'' Caltrans chief engineer Bill Schaefer said Friday. ``The
maintenance reports are not unusual at all.''
   Caltrans structures chief Jim Roberts made similar remarks at a
news conference, saying, ``I don't think it's fraught with any more
(problems)...Bridges grow old like we do.''
   ``I wouldn't leave that thing open if I thought it was unsafe,''
said Roberts, who was driving on the Interstate 880 section the day
before its top deck crashed onto the bottom deck.
   Roberts also insisted it was a lack of technology and not a lack
of money that led to delays in earthquake safety improvements on
I-880 and similar elevated roads supported by ``outrigger'' columns
on either side.
   He also said the collapse of the freeway and the damage to two
other two-tiered roads in San Francisco doesn't mean Caltrans
should stop building such structures. He said use of new technology
can ensure safety.
   The three _ I-880, the Embarcadero and I-280 _ were the only
double-deck freeways in Northern California, and all were closed by
the quake.
   Roberts also said it's not the Caltrans policy to make easy
repairs first to quake-threatened roads, adding, ``The worst case
is being fixed first.'' And he repeated that the 1\-mile-long
section of freeway that collapsed had not been viewed as a hazard.
   Caltrans has spent $54 million on first-stage earthquake safety
improvements, mainly to tie roadways to support columns, and is
spending an additional $64 million on second-stage improvements to
strengthen vertical columns, but the plan doesn't include the
Nimitz freeway or other ``multi-columned'' freeways because they
were considered safe.
   Roberts said the third-stage work, which involves strengthening
double-column supports, will have to include roads such as the
Nimitz. He said the third-phase cost could run as high as $300
million, and research under way on how to fix double-column
structures will be speeded up.
   He added that the cost of replacing the Nimitz Freeway section
could range from $50 million to $100 million, once it's demolished.
   Schaefer and Roberts also questioned various statements from
outside engineers who have said I-880 had an outdated design and
was vulnerable to quakes.
   ``You can talk to 100 engineers and get 100 different answers,''
said Schaefer. Roberts added, ``We can armchair quarterback
everything we do, let's face it.''
   Asked whether the fill land beneath the Nimitz was too soft,
Roberts said, ``I don't think you can say the land is so unstable
you can't build a bridge there.'' Reports made available Friday by
Caltrans showed top layers of fill and rubble over soft clay and
gravel.
   Another report, produced in 1982 by the state Department of
Mines and Geology said, in part: ``The elevated section through
downtown Oakland is expected to be extensively damaged.
Liquefaction and related ground failures will occur'' in a quake
with a magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
   Tuesday's earthquake registered at 6.9.
   ``The hydraulic fills used to construct miles of freeway along
the east shore of (San Francisco Bay) in Alameda County may liquefy
during heavy shaking, with long sections becoming totally
impassable,'' said the report to the Governor's Emergency Task
Force on Earthquake Preparedness.
   ``Of course, the soils had a lot to do with the collapse,'' said
John Kariotis, one of the engineers offering criticism Friday. ``Go
back and look at pictures of Oakland in 1916. It was all marsh that
was filled in.''
   Kariotis, a South Pasadena expert on earthquake effects, and San
Francisco engineer Loring Wyllie, in San Francisco, also said that
if I-880's columns had been girded in steel and addtional concrete,
the elevated section probably would not have collapsed.
   The collapse was ``an unfortunate combination of an old
structure on soft ground,'' said Ian Buckle, the prominent
structural engineer who was named by Gov. Deukmejian to chair a
special panel reviewing the I-880 disaster. ``I'm not surprised
given the earthquake. We know those column of these old structures
are vulnerable.''

   County communications technicians had
just completed installing new computerized emergency radio
equipment when the earthquake struck, officials said.
   ``They had just become operable, I mean we're just talking a
matter of minutes,'' Carol England, communications supervisor for
the county, said Friday.
   The dispatch center is in the basement of the Santa Cruz county
governmental center. It serves as the nerve center for
law-enforcement, medical and fire emergencies as well as public
works and other county agencies.
   County officials had long planned to replace radio and
computerized dispatch consoles at a cost of about $1 million.
   Existing electronics were pulled out at three of the center's
seven dispatching stations Tuesday and telephone company workers
had scarcely connected phone lines to the new equipment when the
quake hit at 5:04 p.m., England said.
   If the earthquake had struck 10 minutes earlier, England said,
the calls would have gone to the four dispatchers operating
existing equipment, overloading the system.
   ``The minute the power came back on (from emergency generators),
every phone line on the all the consoles was lit,'' England said.
   Most of the calls concerned structure damage or fires.
   England said each operator handled about 10 calls a minute in
the frantic hours after the quake. The center remained staffed 24
hours a day with additional dispatchers loaned by San Mateo county.

   As workers continue the painstaking
effort to chip away freeway concrete from crushed motorists,
psychologists and counselors have launched their own
round-the-clock effort to help rescuers cope.
   Denver psychologist Tom Williams said Friday the slowness of the
recovry effort and the extent of the carnage are particularly
frustrating for workers, who may be susceptible to long-term
emotional problems.
   ``The biggie is when they go back to their regular jobs, they
feel so meaningless,'' said Williams, who was coordinating the
on-site counseling program.
   Stress from the rescue is building up, said Williams, who urged
workers to share their concerns and problems with friends as well
as professional counselors.
   ``If you don't deal with it, it's going to come up and bite you
on the butt later,'' Williams said. ``They might not want to be
rescue workers later.''
   As days pass and workers continue pounding through pavement in
their search for bodies, workers struggle with the frustrations of
slow equipment, he said.
   Typically, rescuers are accustomed to retrieving people who can
be saved, but the chances of discovering a survivor are now
extremely slim, he said.
   ``With every passing hour, the little candle in the tunnel ...
dims for them,'' Williams said. ``It's amazing, the strength of
character these people have.''
   The rescue scene is overwhelming, said the former career Marine
who served two tours of duty in Vietnam.
   ``It just reminds me of being in Vietnam for a couple of
years,'' said Williams. ``It smelled like sort of the same thing.''

   One person grabbed a priceless collection
of jazz records. Others searched for photo albums. Some piled up
chairs, chests and everything else they could on the streets.
   ``Our poor little lives are right here on the sidewalk,'' said
Patrice Gehrke, 36, packing items from furniture to ferns in the
back of a pickup truck Friday.
   For residents of the city's upscale Marina District whose homes
may have to be demolished, Friday was a dash to salvage whatever
they could from the rubble of Tuesday's earthquake.
   They stuffed their belongings into Mercedes, BMWs and other
luxury cars if they couldn't find rental trucks or pickups. Others
carried away goods in shopping carts, toy wagons, cardboard boxes,
laundry baskets and garbage bags.
   Residents were supposed to have just 15 minutes to grab all
their valuables. Those whose buildings will be torn down were given
red tags and escorted into their homes by a corps of officials
wearing orange vests and hard hats.
   But the time limit was largely ignored. Some tossed possessions
through upper-floor windows.
   ``I felt like I just won a free hour in the supermarket on one
of those TV game shows,'' said Al Challacomb, guarding his stash of
belongings on a buckled sidewalk.
   The mood was not always lighthearted.
   Some people returned to find their homes and apartments
collapsed. One couple stood in the street in a tearful embrace.
   Jennifer Ritz tried not to cry as she squeezed clothes, artwork,
chairs, tables and knickknacks into every available inch of her
friend's blue Mercedes.
   ``You feel rushed, and you can't stop to think of what you
should take,'' said Ms. Ritz, a legal secretary.
   ``I'm alive, but I've lost certain aspects of my life,'' she
said, sobbing. ``I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what
I'm doing. It's terribly unsettling. I just feel like I'm lost.''
   Ways of life crumbled along with stucco condominiums and posh
apartments in the neighborhood, the worst-hit in San Francisco
because its homes were built on landfill, not bedrock.
   As many as 60 homes either collapsed or will be torn down. Many
others were too severely damaged to live in. Damage was so bad
police cordoned off eight square blocks after gas leaks were
detected.
   When residents were allowed back in, the operation looked like a
grotesque sidewalk sale. Streets held motley piles of leather
couches, cedar chests, mahogany trunks, lamps, paintings, chairs,
televisions, stereos, VCRs, skis, snowshoes, vacuum cleaners,
microwaves and mattresses.
   Janet Wyleczuk, 28, was able to grab her dishes, clothes and
personal mementoes out of an apartment scheduled to be demolished.
   ``This was our last chance,'' she said. ``I was able to get a
piece of my past before starting n.''
   ``All I cared about was my photo albums,'' said Lisa Radomski.
   Helmeted motorcycle police officers and Red Cross volunteers
assisted with the chores, huffing and puffing their way down the
stairs.
   Diane Whitacre, 47, hoisted a drawing board on her shoulder so
she could get on with her free-lance work.
   ``The most important thing to me was the stuff I need to make a
living. Life does go on,'' said Ms. Whitacre.
   ``You can always buy another bed. You can always buy new
clothes.''

<HEAD>They're Here: Quake T-Shirts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was as inevitable as The Big One
promises to be.
   Earthquake T-shirts, with such slogans as ``I Survived the Great
Quake 1989,'' began popping up in tourist corners of San Francisco
just days after the quake.
   ``Everybody wants one thing,'' Moishe Sewell said at a
Fisherman's Wharf shirt shop Friday. ``They don't care how much it
costs. They say, `When can I have one?'''
   T-shirts from the disastrous quake that rumbled through Northern
California have surpassed World Series shirts in popularity in this
baseball-crazy city.
   ``America leads the way in cashing in at times like this,'' said
Lisa Cozens, a tourist from Melbourne, Australia. ``People may
still be trapped in the rubble, but the T-shirts are here.''
   She bought a shirt.
   Other shirts available included: ``6.9 _ '89 _ Bay Area Quake,''
for $10, and ``I Survived the Quake _ 7.0,'' for $20.
   Quake-related T-shirts were, on average, about twice as
expensive as other tourist shirts, such as ``Alcatraz Swim Team.''
   The owner of one of nine T-shirt stores on Jefferson Street at
Fisherman's Wharf said he sold 1,000 shirts in 30 minutes one
morning.
   Sewell was selling quake shirts for $20 apiece, and he
characterized the sales as a public service.
   ``The only way to help the city at a time like this is to fill
its coffers,'' said Sewell. ``If we didn't fill our coffers,
someone else would fill theirs.''
   Some shirt merchants said they would donate proceeds to relief
efforts. Shop owner Nick Hoppe said he would kick in $8 for each
$16 shirt he sold.
   One shop owner, Bertha Jimenez, said she would not sell any
earthquake T-shirts.
   ``People were killed,'' she said. ``I feel terrible. I am not
going to sell a shirt like that. It would make me feel too sad. Not
right now, anyway.
   ``Maybe next week. Come back next week. I'll probably have some
then.''

<HEAD>Pilot of Wandering Plane Loses Right To Fly</HEAD>

   The Federal Aviation Administration won't
allow Thomas Root, who ended up in the Atlantic Ocean after flying
unconscious for several hours last July, to pilot planes again
anytime soon.
   The communications lawyer said Friday the FAA had pulled the
medical certificate he needs to fly, but that he wouldn't take a
plane in the air anyway.
   ``It would be a very foolhardy thing for me to do to go flying
without knowing what caused the blackout,'' Root said after
receiving a letter informing him of the FAA decision.
   Root, whose Washington communications law firm filed for
bankruptcy after the July 13 incident, said he would turn in his
certificate as ordered.
   But Root added, ``I don't need the FAA to tell me it would be
dumb to fly.''
   The FAA said Root was suspended because he refused to supply all
relevant medical documents, including psychiatric records from his
treatment in Hollywood, Fla., after the flight.
   Root suffered from a gunshot wound he said must have occurred
when a pistol he kept in the cockpit discharged, apparently as the
plane hit the water off Bermuda.
   Root said he no longer owns a plane and had not flown since the
incident that occurred as he was on a business flight from
Washington to Rocky Mount, N.C. Root's pilot's certificate was not
suspended, but he cannot fly without medical certification.
   In a letter dated Wednesday, FAA counsel Donald P. Byrne told
Root FAA Administrator James B. Busey ordered the suspension and
``safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the
immediate effectiveness of this order.''
   The letter said Root had 10 days to appeal to the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.
   Root has challenged in court the board's use of his psychiatric
records, claiming Florida law protects their confidentiality.
   Root's attorney, Gene Propper, said the hospital had refused to
release the records but inadvertently sent them to the safety board
along with other medical documents.

<HEAD>New Sanctions to Penalize Americans Who Do Business with Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is expected to
announce next week that it will make it a crime for any American to
do business with Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or firms in
which he has an interest.
   The penalty for violators is a jail term or fines of $500,000,
officials said Friday.
   The sanction is the product of an effort by the administration
to find ways of pressuring Noriega without further damaging the
Panamanian economy. In an additional bid to deprive Panama of
sorely needed income, the administration also is considering
barring Panamanian-flag vessels from U.S. ports, said the
administration officials.
   Panama has been in a steep economic decline over the past year
and a half, partly as a result of limited sanctions imposed by the
United States.
   Many of the more than 30 firms targeted by the new sanctions are
used as intermediaries for illegal trade between the United States
and Cuba.
   The U.S. move will not only tighten the embargo against Cuba but
will also affect firms in which Noriega has an interest, said the
officials, who asked not to be identified.
   The sanction was first reported by The Los Angeles Times in its
Friday editions. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler had
no comment on the report.
   Cuba has found the Panamanian firms identified with Noriega to
be useful, using them to import high technology U.S.-made items
which would otherwise be beyond Cuba's reach because of the trade
embargo.
   The firms also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban exports
to the United States, officials said, speaking on condition they
not be identified.
   The Bush administration has been searching for additional ways
to weaken Noriega since long before the abortive coup attempt
against him almost three weeks ago.
   The administration has not ruled out the use of force but
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said Friday any
such step would be unwise.
   ``Interventionism is never desirable,'' Gonzalez said shortly
before ending his two-day visit here.
   He praised President Bush for not committing U.S. forces to
all-out support for the rebel officers who revolted against Noriega.
   Gonzalez has called for new elections in Panama and for the
newly elected leadership to have the authority to name a new
Defense Force commander to replace Noriega.

<TEXT>
   A small generic drug manufacturer in New York
is recalling seven products because the company filed false
information to win government approval for the drugs, according to
the company and government officials.
   Quantum Pharmics of Amityville, N.Y., last month suspended the
production and distribution of all 21 of its generic drugs pending
completion of an internal audit.
   American Home Products Corp. of New York said the audit found
that the seven drugs being recalled had been approved ``on the
basis of false information filed by the company's (Quantum's) prior
management,'' the company said Friday.
   American Home Products completed acquisition of Quantum in June
1988, said spokeswoman Carol Emerling.
   The FDA said for some of the drugs, the company told the agency
the size of the production batch submitted for testing to gain FDA
approval was larger than it actually was. For other drugs, the FDA
said it was concerned about data submitted in the original
applications for approval.
   The drugs being recalled are minoxidil tablets, chlorazepate
dipotassium tablets, meclofenamate sodium capsules, trazadone,
doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam.
   Both the FDA and the company said there was no indication of any
safety problem with any of the drugs.
   Quantum is among more than 30 generic drug manufacturers being
investigated by the FDA following disclosures of irregularities
ranging from falsified records to misrepresentation of test data.

<HEAD>Union Leader Speaks About Abuses From Computer Monitoring</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: 9to5 in 2nd graf is correct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a clerical workers' union says
employers are using computer surveillance to supervise their
employees out of ``control and fear.''
   Karen Nussbaum, executive director of 9to5, the National
Association of Working Women, appealed to computer specialists
Friday to help curb abuses that she says are leaving many of the
nation's lowest-paid workers frustrated in their workplace.
   ``A management strategy characterized by this lack of commitment
to and faith in the workforce requires a supervision style based on
control and fear,'' she said. ``Surveillance and control now take
the place of supervision, commitment and training.''
   ``You are the creators of this wonderful technology,'' she told
a meeting sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility, a public interest group based in Palo Alto, Calif.
``But it is misused. And there is no one with more credibility than
you to speak out against this misuse.''
   Ms. Nussbaum also serves as president of District 925 of the
Service Employees International Union, representing about 10,000
clerical workers.
   Computer monitoring is most widely used with workers using video
display terminals. Modern technology enables employers to
automatically monitor a variety of work performance data, including
keyboard strokes, typing mistakes, time spent on each phone call
and rest breaks.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment has said
``there are strong arguments that the present extent of
computer-based monitoring is only a preview of growing
technological capabilities for monitoring, surveillance and worker
testing on the job.''
   ``If this is the case, then there may be a need for a new
balance between workers' rights to privacy or autonomy in the
workplace and management requirements for information,'' OTA said
in a 1987 report.
   Several states _ including Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island _ are considering
bills that seek to regulate computer monitoring practices.
   Industry management officials generally argue that computer
monitoring, if properly used, benefits employees by providing an
objective basis for evaluating work performance and rewarding more
productive workers.
   Ms. Nussbaum cited a survey released earlier this year by the
Massachusetts Coalition on New Office Technology, a Boston-based
union-affiliated group, which took questionnaire responses from
more than 700 electronically monitored office workers.
   The survey found 62 percent of the respondents were not informed
they would be monitored prior to hiring, 75 percent of the workers
said monitoring lowers morale and 80 percent said monitoring makes
their job more stressful.
   ``This survey shows deep alienation from the (work) process. And
these feelings are substantiated by study after study,'' Ms.
Nussbaum said.

<HEAD>Immigration Judge Denies Asylum to Polish Sailor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish sailor who is seeking political asylum
says he fears for his life if he's deported, even though an
American judge doesn't think the newly liberalized Polish
government poses any threat.
   ``I will be persecuted. I will be jailed. I might lose my life
if I am returned to Poland because the media there knows that I
have asked for asylum,'' Polish fisherman Roman Marczak, 25, said
through an interpreter.
   Immigration Judge Jesse Sellers ruled Thursday that Marczak had
nothing to fear from the recently reformed Polish government.
   ``I think the applicant has failed to prove a well-founded fear
of persecution by the present government of Poland,'' Sellers said.
``Prior to those recent changes, I think he would have had a
well-founded fear.''
   ``(Marczak) is totally ignoring changes made in Communist bloc
countries in the past year,'' the judge said.
   Marczak was one of nine fishermen who defected in Anchorage,
Alaska, in mid-August. All are being held in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Aurora detention facility, where Marczak's
hearing was held.
   He is assured of remaining in the United States for up to
another four months as his case is appealed.
   ``It's a bad decision based on an erroneous legal stcndard,''
said Dan Kowalski, Marczak's lawyer. ``I'm very pessimistic about
the other cases. If this case can't win, I'm dubious that any of
the other cases will win. This was one of the stronger cases.''
   The INS, in a departure from past practice, refused the
fishermen's requests for temporary work permits and transported
them to the detention center here, contending the fishermen were
seeking lucrative jobs on American boats, not freedom from
political persecution.

   British media mogul Robert
Maxwell plans to invest up to $200 million in Argentina in the

   ``The differences between Great Britain and Argentina have gone

   The news came a day after Britain and Argentina, which went to
war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, said
they would upgrade diplomatic relations to the consular level and
remove trade and travel restrictions in effect for nearly six years.
   Menem said Maxwell, who owns a string of newspapers including a

initial investment of $150 million to $200 million.''

<HEAD>Chinese Historians Protest Japanese Decision Not To Revise Textbooks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty Chinese scholars expressed ``surprise and
indignation'' over a Tokyo court ruling against revising textbooks
that avoid calling Japan's 1930s attack on China an aggression.
   ``We Chinese are reluctant to keep bringing up the bitter past,
but that does not mean that we can allow the Japanese to hurt
Chinese feelings by distorting history,'' the academics said in a
statement Friday later carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.
   China says at least 200,000 people were killed when Japanese
troops invaded Nanjing in 1937, and it has strongly objected to
Japanese textbooks characterizing the military campaign as an
``advance'' rather than aggression.
   The scholars, attending a symposium on the Sino-Japanese War of
1937-45, said Japanese aggression against China during that period
was firmly maintained by the international community.
   Tokyo District Court this month ruled the government's
inspection of textbooks is legal but said there were mistakes in
the Education Ministry's orders that parts of a historian's
textbook be rewritten.

   A city official said the leaning tower will
stay open to tourists despite a scientific committee's conclusion
that Pisa's most famous monument is dangerous.
   The committee appointed by the Public Works Ministry said the
180-foot tower, which has been leaning for 800 years, tilts more
each year, that some of the stone work is crumbling and pieces of
stone have fallen off.
   They said officials should consider immediately closing the
tower, which now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular.
   ``I will keep the tower open until I am forced to close it,''
Giuseppe Toniolo, chairman of a city committee responsible for
preservation of the tower, said Friday.
   Mayor Giacomino Granchi said he hoped the committee's
recommendations would be quickly evaluated by the Public Works
Ministry. He said closing the tower would cause economic problems
for the city but added: ``it is my wish that the problem with the
tower is confronted decisively, seriously and openly.''

<TEXT>
   Rejected by judicial colleagues and removed from
the bench by Congress, Alcee L. Hastings will take his case to
Florida voters.
   Within minutes of the announcement Friday of his impeachment
conviction in the Senate, the 53-year-old veteran civil rights
activist said he would seek the Democratic nomination for the 1990
governor's race.
   ``Not only can I be elected, I think I will,'' Hastings said in
Washington. ``Floridians are tired of ordinariness, and if there's
nothing else I bring to an experience, it is not ordinariness.
   Hastings is the sixth federal judge removed and the first
impeached after acquittal by a jury.
   ``I'm not disgraced. The Constitution is disgraced,'' Hastings
said. ``Life goes on, and there will be joy in the morning.''
   He held a party for friends in Washington late Friday,
declaring, ``We was robbed.''
   Hastings' last foray into politics was a lopsided defeat in the
1970 U.S. Senate Democratic primary in Florida.
   Jon Peck, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez,
belittled the former judge's chances in the political arena.
   ``Based on that track record, he's going to run for governor?''
Peck asked. ``Anybody who wants to is welcome to run for governor.
They'll have to take on an incumbent who is going to get
re-elected.''
   The governor, who was on a glass-bottom boat in the Florida Keys
with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, laughed when told of
Hastings' announcement for governor.
   ``You'll have to ask George Stuart and Bill Nelson about that,''
he said, referring to the Democrats in the race.
   Said state Democratic Party Chairman Simon Ferro: ``I would
certainly like to sit down with him to assess his opportunities and
his chances and how they might affect the race. That's about as
much as I can tell you at this point.''
   Hastings, appointed in 1979 by President Carter as the first
black U.S. district judge in Florida after a career of civil rights
litigation and experience as a state judge, plans to return to law
practice while gearing up a gubernatorial campaign.
   Plagued by clogged arteries, he also has indicated he wants to
undergo surgery before his federal insurance expires in 30 days.
   Under a cloud since an FBI sting operation probing alleged
case-fixing began in 1981, Hastings has refused to step aside
despite mounting evidence and accusations against him. He and his
attorneys have argued that charges against him were racially tinged
witchhunts.
   He was convicted Friday on eight of 17 impeachment counts. The
Senate voted 95-0 to acquit on charges he leaked confidential
wiretap information to Metro-Dade County Mayor Steve Clark.
   Black reaction Friday was indignant.
   ``It's a definite travesty to our justice system,'' said
Roosevelt Walters, head of the Fort Lauderdale branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``We
have to wonder who is next? Who will be singled out?''
   The judge was voted out for allegedly conspiring to take a
$150,000 payoff to fix a court case. A federal jury in Miami
acquitted him in 1983, although his friend William A. Borders, a
Washington attorney, was convicted of bribery conspiracy in a
separate trial.
   Judicial colleagues launched an investigation that led to
Hastings' impeachment last year in the House, which accused him of
plotting to obtain a bribe, lying during his trial and an unrelated
charge of improperly disclosing federal wiretap information.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, astonished at the
destruction the Northern California earthquake tore through the San
Francisco Bay area, is pledging the government will ``do what's
necessary to fix it.''
   ``There's no ceiling on the compassion of the American people,''
Bush said Friday after what he called ``a very moving day'' touring
sites of devastation the earthquake left behind, including the
collapsed freeway that entombed uncounted bodies.
   ``I'm willing to do what's needed to be done,'' Bush said as he
walked amid the rubble of Santa Cruz's shattered business mall, a
few miles from the Tuesday quake's epicenter.
   He didn't promise a specific amount, and declined several times
to rule out the possibility of tax increases to pay for recovery
costs.
   State officials estimate the total damage at $5.5 billion, but
some estimates say damage may reach $10 billion,
   ``In terms of what it will cost, I don't know,'' said Bush, who
has already signed a disaster relief declaration for seven Bay-area
counties and authorized an initial $273 million. He said Washington
will work with local and state governments ``to see the suffering
is alleviated, the restoration begins.''
   Bush, who won office on a firm pledge of no new taxes, said,
``I'm going to do what is necessary to have the federal government
fulfill its obligation,'' and repeated substantially the same
phrase when asked if that meant new taxes.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian has said he is willing to face
a state tax increase, if necessary.
   Bush appeared shocked at the destruction he saw as he walked
along the collapsed Interstate 880 in Oakland and flew by
helicopter over the eerily quiet Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge.
A 50-foot gap in the upper level of the eight-mile, two-deck bridge
gaped where the earthquake knocked a slab of roadway loose.
   At the Oakland highway leading to the bridge, Bush exclaimed
``Jesus'' on seeing the flattened concrete and twisted beams where
workers are still searching for victims. He walked alongside and
even under the highway where flattened cars were crushed beneath
the top portion of the freeway.
   ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very
stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.
   Pressed on whether he would waive tight budget restraints to
speed aid to the region, Bush said, ``We're going to do what is
necessary to fix it ... We will do what is necessary to fulfill our
federal responsibility.''
   At each stop, he greeted rescue workers and praised the
volunteer efforts of those who are helping put the area back
together.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, newly designated to
head federal quake-recovery efforts, said the administration was
putting together a relief package for California, but gave no
figures.
   Bush spent five hours in Northern California for a firsthand
look at some spots worst hit by Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude earthquake.
   He later said his most emotional moment was when he talked to a
surgeon who had to amputate the leg of a 6-year-old boy to rescue
him from a smashed car on I-880. Bush then telephoned the boy's
father.
   ``I had a chance to tell him that the American people are
rooting for him,'' Bush told reporters.
   Bush also taped a public service television announcement
offering encouragement to Bay area residents and urging Americans
around the nation to contribute to volunteer organizations.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, a Democrat from nearby San Jose, said the
damages could run as high as $8 billion to $10 billion. He said the
$2.5 billion suggested Thursday by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
``is not enough.''
   Democratic Rep. Leon Panetta, whose district includes Santa
Cruz, said his area would need ``in excess of $1 billion.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos gave a damage estimate of $2
billion and said up to 2,000 San Franciscans had been made homeless.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said his area suffered about $1.3
billion in damage to buildings.

   A former computer analyst who returned
from a month alone in the wilderness with ``a wild look in his
eye'' was shot and killed after pointing a gun at the police chief,
authorities said.
   David Brian Peatroy, 34, died Thursday as seven or eight people
looked on after he pointed a loaded 9mm pistol at Police Chief Al
Rise and threatened to kill him, Rise and witnesses said.
   Rise had responded to reports of a man brandishing a gun on Main
Street in this town about eight miles south of the Canadian border.
   ``He pointed (the gun) right in my face. ... I had no other
choice,'' Rise said. ``It was over in five seconds. He was
definitely crazy _ stark, raving crazy. He had a wild look in his
eye when he turned around and looked at me.''
   Witnesses said Peatroy, a resident alien originally from
Worthing, England, began acting erratically Tuesday, a week after
returning from a month alone in the Pasayten Wilderness of
Washington's North Cascades mountains.
   He had come to the Oroville area just a few days before leaving
for the wilderness, said Okanogan County Sheriff Jim Weed, whose
department is investigating the shooting in this town of 1,500
people. Peatroy had worked for several years as a computer analyst
in San Diego.
   Pat Miller, co-owner of an outfitting company in nearby
Winthrop, said she and her husband, Claude, had helped Peatroy pack
supplies Sept. 10 to an old tungsten mine in the North Cascades.
   ``He just wanted to get into the wilderness and stay, get away
from the hustle and bustle of city life,'' Mrs. Miller said. ``I
thought he was a nice boy.''
   But Peatroy returned Oct. 10 a changed man, she said.
   ``He was like hyper once in a while,'' Mrs. Miller said. ``His
laugh was a little hysterical, but he'd been in the hills for 30
days and was talking like a magpie, as anybody would.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities began extradition
proceedings against two suspected cocaine traffickers, and the drug
war injured six more people when a car bomb exploded in front of a
Caribbean port hotel.
   Police said the alleged smugglers, both wanted by U.S. federal
courts, were brought to Bogota on Friday after they were detained
the day before in other Colombian cities.
   Police arrested Nelson Cuevas Ramirez, 55, in Cartagena. He was
charged by a New York federal court with possessing cocaine and
conspiring to distribute the drug, according to an official
communique.
   ``I am a legitimate businessman and have a clear conscience,''
Cuevas Ramirez said shortly after his transfer to the capital.
   Authorities said they initiated extradition proceedings against
Cuevas Ramirez and another drug suspect, Robert James Sokolowski
Salah, captured near the Caribbean port of Barranquilla. Sokolowski
was also being held under tight security at a Bogota jail.
   The U.S. Justice Department said Salah's real name was Robert
Sokol Jr. He was charged in 1984 by a federal court in Greensboro,
N.C., with conspiring to distribute cocaine.
   Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said Sokol was born in
Colombia but is believed to have both Colombian and U.S.
citizenship. He was arrested at the Cerrejon coal mine in the
Guajira Peninsula northeast of Barranquilla.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco has extradited four
suspected traffickers to the United States since it began its drug
crackdown Aug. 19, one day after a leading presidential hopeful was
assassinated.
   The latest arrests brings to six the number of Colombians being
processed for extradition. Authorities have not, however, captured
any of the dozen traffickers on a U.S. most-wanted list.
   Traffickers have responded to the extraditions with a campaign
of bombings and assassinations. Since the crackdown began, 165 bomb
blasts have killed 16 people and injured 201.
   The latest explosion attributed to traffickers rocked a hotel in
Barranquilla Friday, seriously injuring five workers and a
Colombian guest.
   Authorities arrested one of two suspects who, according to
witnesses, parked the subcompact Renault packed with 100 pounds of
dynamite near the Royal Hotel shortly before the vehicle exploded.
   Police identified the suspect as 24-year-old Jose Arena Ramirez.
An army general said he worked for drug traffickers.
   ``I beleive that traffickers are responsible for the bombing,''
Gen. Juan Salcedo Lora, commander of the city brigade, told Caracol
radio.
   Three of the bombings have targeted Colombian hotels. A bomb at
the Hilton in Cartagena Sept. 25 killed two people.
   Anonymous callers saying they represented traffickers have
claimed responsibilty for several recent assassinations, including
te slaying of a federal judge Tuesday in Medellin.
   The killing sparked a 72-hour strike by the nation's judges and
court workers to demand more government protection. The strike,
which ended Friday, failed to force the government to adopt drastic
security measures.
   Gregorio Oviedo, a lawyer for the judicial workers' union, said
the government agreed to provide judges with some security
equipment next week, including 25 motorcycles for guards, 72
bulletproof vests and 14 metal detectors.
   But he said that would not even begin to protect the more than
1,000 judges who received death threats.
   ``They are still completely unprotected,'' he said, adding that
none of the promised $19 million in U.S. aid for the judges had
reached Colombia.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults said the
agency sent 75 bulletproof vests to the American Embassy in Bogota.
   In an operation unrelated to the drug war, police Friday rounded
up 2,000 Bogota emerald dealers for questioning following last
week's massacre of seven dealers in Quipama, 60 miles north of
Bogota, Caracol reported.
   About 300 dealers remained in custody while the rest were
released.

   A flurry of earthquakes that hit northern China
this week destroyed 27,500 homes and left more than 50,000
homeless, Radio Beijing said today.
   The broadcast, monitored in Tokyo, also said there have been
1,500 aftershocks, four between 5.0 and 6.0 on the Richter scale,
since the initial temblors devastated farming villages late
Wednesday and early Thursday.
   There were no new reports of casualties today in the official
press, which has carried little coverage of the quakes. Official
reports Friday said 29 people were killed and more than 150 injured.
   The Communist Party's People's Daily said today that the temblor
caused damage in 40 villages over a 320-square-mile area, mostly in
northern Shanxi province.
   It said 1,600 soldiers were mobilized to help relief operations
and that such items as bread, noodles, chopsticks, quilts, tents,
mats and medical supplies were rushed to the affected areas.
   However, the report emphasized that production and commerce were
little affected by the quakes. It said coal production in Datong,
the province's main city, exceeded its normal daily output Thursday.
   The Beijing Radio report also said 32,400 houses were damaged
and in danger of collapse, and that cracks had appeared in the
Shanxi No. 2 dam.
   A Western reporter in the stricken area Friday night said
peasants rigged tents of quilts and straw and gathered around fires
in near-freezing temperatures.
   Northern Shanxi is an impoverished area located on a windswept
plain about 4,000 feet above sea level. The local population works
in coal mines or scratches out a living by growing wheat and corn
in the dusty, infertile soil.
   Many live in homes of mud and stone that easily crumble in
earthquakes.
   Chinese seismologists said the quakes were the worst to hit
northern China since 1976, when a temblor measuring at least 7.8 on
the Richter scale killed 240,000 people in northeastern Tangshan.
   The strongest quake Thursday registered 6.1 on the Richter scale.
   Despite the destruction, casualties appeared to be low because
many people fled their homes after a first quake late Wednesday and
were outside when the second big tremor destroyed their dwellings.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake,
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 6.0 can cause severe damage in a populated area.

   Two New England universities are using different tactics to
grapple with racist attacks and racial hostility on their campuses.
   The University of Massachusetts launched a week of events aimed
at greater racial understanding. At Brown University, authorities
reacting to attacks on Asian and white students said they were
canceling a dance sponsored by a black fraternity, but later the
dance was rescheduled.
   Some students had protested the cancellation.
   ``The whole black community is upset. We feel the university is
holding blacks liable for the attacks in Providence,'' said John
Robertson, vice president of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. ``They're
cutting the social lives of black students at Brown right out from
underneath them. They're taking away the places we go to get away
from the academic rigors at Brown.''
   Robert Reichley, vice president for university affairs, said the
event had been rescheduled and moved to a ``more internally located
part of campus.''
   Officials at the Ivy League school in Providence, R.I., said the
party was moved to discourage high school or non-Brown students
from attending.
   There have been 19 attacks on 22 Brown students since classes
began in September. At least 14 white and Asian men described their
attackers as black teen-agers, believed to be from off-campus.
   Meanwhile, at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
officials opened Civility Week, an eight-day series of events
designed to promote racial harmony on the campus. The series of
events, being held for the second year, marks a brawl that followed
the 1986 World Series. It left one black student seriously injured.
   A number of racial incidents have occurred at New England
campuses in the last two years.
   At exclusive Smith College, racist notes were slipped under the
doors of minority students last spring. At Hampshire and Williams
colleges, also located in western Massachusetts, sit-ins were held
in the spring of 1988 to demand more attention to racial issues on
campus.
   In March of this year ``go home'' notes were shoved under a
black student's door at UMass. This semester, a black man was
assaulted by three white non-students.
   Racism on campus is difficult to predict and hard to stamp out,
said the director of the National Institute Against Prejudice and
Violence.
   ``We're talking about a form of terrorism and there isn't any
defense,'' said Howard Ehrlich, director of research at the
Baltimore-based institute. ``In order to build up a defense you
wind up sacrificing a lot of people's personal rights and
liberties.''
   Ehrlich said the institute estimates one out of five minority
students are victimized during the course of an academic year,
based on case studies on a dozen campuses.
   He said he recommends that colleges take a two-pronged approach
to racism: institute stiff punishment for offenders and establish a
core of educational programs.
   ``You cannot organize to stop random acts, so what you try to do
in a sense is to inoculate a campus to deal with the effects and
the impacts,'' he said. ``You can watch your curriculum and you can
watch the way in which the university as an institution deals with
matters of group relations.''

<HEAD>NJ Reps Want Express Trains to Include Stop in State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some New Jersey members of Congress don't want
their state to be sacrificed in the competition between Amtrak and
the Trump Shuttle for the New York-Washington travel market.
   The national railroad company is preparing to offer three
additional express metroliners between New York and Washington at
month's end to retain its dominance of the air-rail route.
   But the New Jersey representatives, led by Republican Rep.
Matthew Rinaldo, say Newark is being unfairly left out of the
quicker metroliner service.
   ``This decision by your office is a shortsighted effort that
disserves the Newark-New York metropolitan area,'' Rinaldo said in
a letter to W. Graham Claytor Jr.
   Garden State riders account for 1.2 million Amtrak passengers
each year, half of whom board or disembark at Newark.
   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said New Jersey service is not
being sacrificed for the express trains.
   ``We are not reducing the number of metroliner service trains in
New Jersey that are stopping in New Jersey,'' he said.

<NOTE>Lamia Sausage Voluntarily Recalling Meat Products</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says Lamia's
Sausage Co. of St. Louis, Mo., is voluntarily recalling all of its
meat products because they may contain high levels of sulfites.
   The company sells some products across the counter in its St.
Louis retail store, but most products are distributed to
restaurants in nearby areas in Missouri and Illinois.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Friday that no illnesses have
been reported but that consumers and other purchasers should
``immediately return any products produced by the company.''
   The recalled products include: Lamia's Spedini's, bratwurst,
Italian sausage with cheese, Italian sausage with beef and tomato
sauce, Italian sausage (pork), ground beef patties, ground beef,
and Italia Brand Beef Patty Mix. Products can be identified further
by the establishment code ``Est. 13000'' inside the USDA inspection
seal.
   Crawford said that because of the high levels of sulfites found
during testing, sulfite-sensitive consumers could become seriously
ill or even die.

<NOTE>Bush Working With South Americans for Drug Summit</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is working with
officials from three South American cocaine-producing countries to
determine a site for a drug summit, a White House official says.
   ``We can't rule anything in or out,'' deputy press secretary
Alixe Glen said Friday.
   She commented in response to questions about a story in the
Washington Times, which said the Secret Service had informally
rejected Cartagena, Colombia, as the site for the summit because
the president's safety could not be guaranteed in a country torn by
drug-related violence.
   The newspaper said Puerto Rico was the most likely site, and
indeed, officials have mentioned that it is a leading contender.
   Ms. Glen said the United States was working with Peru, Colombia
and Bolivia to determine the location, timing, agenda and
participants for the summit. She said representatives of the four
countries will meet Nov. 20 to decide the details.
   Secret Service spokesman Robert Snow declined to comment on the
report.

<NOTE>Soviets Buy More US Grain</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says private
exporting companies have sold the Soviet Union an additional 2.82
million metric tons of U.S. corn, a record for a single purchase,
for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement.
   The department said Friday that 105,000 tons of soybean meal
also were sold to the Soviet Union for 1989-90 delivery.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total nearly 7.87 million tons of corn, 143,700 tons of
soybeans and 430,000 tons of soybean meal.
   Two of the orders since Oct. 1 have been record breakers,
according to a list compiled by the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service for sales going back more than 10 years. The
latest for 2.82 million tons topped the previous high of 2 million
tons reported on Oct. 3.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 totalled a record of more
than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of
corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 2.82 million tons
of corn would be more than 111 million bushels.

<HEAD>Society to End Relationship with Station that Co-Produced Specials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 15 years and 27 Emmys, the National
Geographic Society will sever its relationship with WQED-TV, the
station that has co-produced the National Geographic specials.
   The society has announced it will take over management and
production of the specials in 1992, when the current contract
expires.
   WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., will replace WQED as the station
that will make the program available to public television stations
across the nation. WETA will not be involved in production of the
specials other than as a consultant.
   ``Almost everything we do at the society is done in-house,'' Tim
Kelly, vice president and director of television at National
Geographic, said Thursday. ``It just seemed like the time in our
evolution to let things play out in our outside relationship and
bring the specials back in-house.''
   Chevron Corp., based in San Francisco, continue as sponsor.
   WQED and the society have co-produced the award-winning specials
since they moved to public television in 1974. The society
terminated its contract with WQED in February, and the parties have
been negotiating since then.
   WQED Communications Vice President Tom Skinner, executive
producer of the specials, issued the following statement from
London, where he and other top WQED executives are attending a
festival:
   ``The combined efforts of the many talented WQED people who have
contributed to the success of the specials will now be available to
work on our upcoming eight-hour `Space Age' series and our
continuing `Infinite Voyage' specials, among our other efforts soon
to be launched,'' he said.
   ``Space Age,'' a $6 million co-production with the National
Academy of Sciences, is timed to coincide with the 1992
International Space Year.

<HEAD>Anthony Quayle, Oscar Nominee, Veteran Stage Actor, Dead At 76</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Anthony Quayle, a veteran actor-director of
the classical theater credited with helping launch the careers of
many British theater greats, has died of cancer. He was 76.
   Quayle died at his London home Friday, said his agent, Laurence
Evans.
   The self-effacing Quayle found Broadway fame as the detective
writer in ``Sleuth'' and was nominated for an Oscar for ``Anne of
the Thousand Days,'' in which he played Cardinal Wolsey.
   But his greatest legacy was his devotion to classical theater.
   In Stratford-on-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, Quayle headed
the Shakespeare Memorial Theater from 1948-1956. There, he raised
the standards of classical acting and helped along the careers of
Richard Burton, Robert Shaw, and Rachel Roberts, among others.
   He employed the major actor-knights of his generation _ the late
Laurence Olivier, the late Ralph Richardson, and John Gielgud _ and
turned Stratford into the touchstone by which Shakespearean
performance in Britain was measured.
   In 1985, Quayle himself was knighted.
   Director Peter Hall, who founded the Royal Shakespeare Company
in 1960, called Quayle ``a great man of the theater _ actor,
director, creator of companies.''
   Hall spoke through a spokeswoman at the Houston Grand Opera,
where he is rehearsing the opera ``New Year.''
   He said Quayle ``was largely responsible for the extraordinary
renaissance of the Stratford-on-Avon festival. ... He was a superb
leader with a passion for Shakespeare and with a great talent for
bringing the best out of people.''
   Quayle was a company man throughout his career, from the Old Vic
Theater in 1932 to Compass, the touring company he founded in 1984.
   ``I thought of myself as a rather funny-looking, rather large
fellow who would never be a matinee hero. So I went into classical
companies,'' he once remarked.
   In an interview with London's Independent newspaper last summer
he wondered whether he had not ``poured creativity into others at
the expense of my own.''
   Gielgud remembered him as ``very fair, very unbitchy, very
uninterested in gossip and always in a good humor, amusing and
understanding.''
   Over the years, his stage work spanned Shakespeare and Sheridan,
Bertolt Brecht and Francois Billetdoux.
   He was London's first Eddie Carbone in Arthur Miller's ``A View
From the Bridge'' and planned to participate in an American play,
``Never the Sinner,'' until illness required him to drop out before
rehearsals.
   He made his Broadway debut in 1956 in William Wycherley's ``The
Country Wife,'' but had his greatest success with ``Sleuth,''
Anthony Shaffer's two-character comedy thriller.
   The play, co-starring Keith Baxter, ran on Broadway for 1,222
performances, and producer Morton Gottleib remembered Quayle as ``a
wonderful actor.''
   ``There are some actors who have a certain personality and no
matter what the role is, that personality takes over the stage,''
Gottleib said. ``But Tony Quayle would fit into whatever the role
and characterization.''
   Quayle last appeared on Broadway opposite Mary Martin in the
short-lived 1978 play ``Do You Turn Somersaults?''
   His movie career was erratic. Quayle, a former paratrooper,
often found himself cast in war films, from ``Battle of the River
Plate'' and ``Operation Crossbow'' to ``The Guns of Navarone'' and
``HMS Defiant.''
   He appeared in David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and Alfred
Hitchcock's ``The Wrong Man.'' his television credits included ``QB
VII,'' ``Masada,'' and ``Oedipus At Colonus.''
   He wrote two bestselling novels, ``Eight Hours From England''
(1945) and ``On Such A Night'' (1947), both based on his
experiences in World War II.
   He is survived by his second wife, Dorothy, an American actress,
two daughters and a son. His first marriage ended in divorce.

<HEAD>Archbishop of Canterbury Endorses Episcopal Bishops' Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Canterbury helped the
Episcopal Church celebrate its 200th anniversary in America and
praised the leaders of the church for compromising on a dispute
over the ordination of women.
   Archbishop Robert A.K. Runcie, spiritual head of the world's 70
million Anglicans, celebrated the Eucharist and visited with
Episcopalians on Friday in the hometown of Suffragan Bishop Barbara
C. Harris of Massachusetts, the church's first woman bishop.
   The Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of the Anglican Communion,
was founded in 1789 as the first free and independent Anglican
church outside the British Isles.
   The Episcopal House of Bishops, the ruling body of the church,
last month issued a statement affirming the ordination of women
while calling for sensitivity toward those who believe women
shouldn't be ordained.
   The bishops' statement welcomed Ms. Harris, but said those
within Anglicanism who oppose the ordination of women ``hold a
recognized theological position.''
   Runcie commended the bishops for their ``courtesy and respect''
toward those who reject the American church's position.
   ``I pay tribute to that spirit of unity and to the wise and
sensitive pastoral leadership of Bishop Browning, which has done so
much to foster it,'' he said. ``It needs translation into every
diocese in the communion.'' Edmond Browning is the presiding
Episcopal bishop.
   Runcie celebrated the Eucharist at the Episcopal Church of the
Saviour in west Philadelphia on Friday, then spoke at a banquet for
the Diocese of Pennsylvania's annual convention at Memorial Hall in
the city's Fairmount Park. Earlier Friday, Runcie said at a news
conference that Anglican church leaders in November would consider
taking the issue of ordaining women before their dioceses. He
declined to comment on his own beliefs.
   James Solheim, a church spokesman in New York, said the
Archbishop's Commission on Communion and Women in the Episcopate _
known as the Eames Commission after its chairman, Archbishop Robin
Eames of Ireland _ was meeting Friday in London and might issue a
response to the statement by the Episcopal House of Bishops.
   Eleven bishops from the Church of England on Friday declared
their support for women priests and bishops.
   Said English Bishop Jim Thompson, ``We are trying to reclaim the
sense that not all catholics in the Anglican Communion are against
the ordination of women. Many are in favor.''
   The Church of England does not permit the ordination of women.
   Runcie and Pope John Paul II signed a document three weeks ago
that committed the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches to working
to heal their 450-year-old schism.
   Vatican and Anglican officials have been holding talks since
1966. The estrangement began when King Henry VIII formed his own
church after the pope refused to grant him an annulment of his
marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
   Some English Protestants criticized Runcie's visit. He was only
the second archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal Mass since
the Reformation.
   The Anglican Communion includes 28 national or regional churches
in 164 countries.

<TEXT>
   A court reporter has been jailed more
than two weeks for failing to finish the transcript of a 1987
double murder trial that is now under appeal.
   Donna Creel of Red Oak was jailed Oct. 4 after the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals issued a contempt order. She remained in the
Ellis County Jail Friday, officials said.
   Mrs. Creel took nearly 8,000 pages of notes from the murder
trial of Kenneth Dewayne Thomas, who was convicted for the March
1986 murder of a Dallas attorney and his wife. No action can be
taken on the appeal until the appeals court obtains a transcript.
   The transcript of the trial was originally due in November 1987
and Ms. Creel was given four extensions, the last until Aug. 7,
before the nine-member appeals court issued the contempt order.
   Mrs. Creel's attorney, Ron Bunch, said she is spending up to 20
hours a day working on the transcript and expects to finish next
week.
   ``She's going to be all right,'' Bunch said. ``She's not getting
much sleep.''

<HEAD>LTV May Sell Hummer Military Vehicle To Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For motorists seeking something special in
off-road adventure, a defense contractor thinks it may have the
answer.
   The builder of the Hummer military vehicle may soon make the
four-wheel-drive, five-ton jeep-like vehicle available to the
public.
   LTV Corp.'s AM General Division, which builds the Hummer, or
High-Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle, has developed a new
version with a heavier chassis that can carry 2\ tons of cargo.
   The Hummer is being sold to the Army, but AM General has
received inquiries from individuals who want the vehicle for
hunting, ranching or just plain off-road fun.
   Craig Mac Nab, company spokesman, said the South Bend,
Ind.-based division is weighing product liability questions and
conducting market studies on demand for the Hummer, which could
cost around $30,000 each.
   Mac Nab told The Dallas Morning News he believes the vehicle
could be competitively priced with other upper-end, off-road
vehicles.
   ``It wouldn't have to be as expensive as a military model
because you wouldn't need all those features,'' Mac Nab said.
Military versions sport such features as armor plating and Stinger
missile carriers.

   A Panamanian Embassy official said
today that a Panamanian military attache appeared to have sought
political asylum in the United States after being implicated in a
recent coup attempt.
   The embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
retired Maj. Leonidas Pretelt, 44, secretly left the South Korean
capital Thursday with his wife and three children on a flight to
Oregon.
   ``We are sure that he left Seoul to seek asylum in the United
States,'' the official said. ``He was suspected of being involved
in a coup attempt and forced to retire from active duty,'' he said
without elaborating.
   There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials.
   A group of Panamanian military officers tried Oct. 3 to topple
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, indicted in Florida on drug
trafficking charges and whose refusal to step down has prompted
Washington to impose sanctions against the Panamanian government.
   The South Korean national police, at the request of the
Panamanian Embassy, discovered Friday that Pretelt secretly left
Seoul for Portland, Ore., aboard a Delta Air Lines plane Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements stunned abortion foes by
refusing to put the issue on the agendas of two scheduled special
sessions of the state Legislature.
   Abortion opponents angered by Clements' decision Friday recalled
the governor's previous statement that Texans ``can bet on'' a
special abortion session to react to the latest U.S. Supreme Court
abortion ruling.
   ``I'm glad I didn't put any money on it,'' said Bill Price,
president of Texans United for Life.
   Clements Friday said abortion wouldn't be on the agenda of
either the November special session called to consider workers'
compensation or the spring session on school financing. But his
press secretary, Rossanna Salazar, said, ``Whether it (abortion) is
the subject of a future special session, anything is possible.''
   Particularly galling to anti-abortion activists is the fact the
governor, a Republican, is opposed to abortion.
   ``I consider it to be a betrayal,'' Price said of Clements'
statement. ``He's playing political football with the lives of
unborn children.''
   A Supreme Court ruling in July gave states wider powers to limit
abortions.
   Clements, who isn't seeking re-election, will be out of office
by the time the next regular session begins in January 1991. The
governor calls and sets the agenda for special legislative sessions.
   Ms. Salazar said Clements hasn't changed his anti-abortion
beliefs. The governor is against abortions except in the cases of
rape, incest, or if the life of the mother is in danger, she said.
   ``We're not going to cloud the issue of the special session on
workers' compensation by putting in these other extraneous
issues,'' Clements said of the first special session.
   Ms. Salazar said Clements wouldn't put abortion on the agenda of
the second session, either. ``The governor believes that this issue
would be better served if it were considered during a regular
session,'' she said.
   She said Clements believes Texas lawmakers need to wait for
additional abortion cases pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Current Texas law forbids abortions in the third trimester,
unless the life of the mother is in danger.

   A Russian sailor trying to cross the Pacific in
a 20-foot sailboat was rescued by a passing container ship after
drifting for 67 days, the Coast Guard reported.
   The 30-year-old man appeared to be in satisfactory condition,
although he had lost a lot of weight, a Coast Guard official said
Friday.
   No one on the container ship speaks Russian, and the sailor
doesn't speak English, so his story was pieced together through
sign language and by looking at his log book, said the coast guard
official, who refused to be quoted by name.
   It wasn't clear if the man was trying to defect, the Coast Guard
official said.
   Coast Guard investigators believe the 20-foot vessel left the
Soviet port of Vladivostok about June 2, bound for San Francisco,
and lost its mast August 14, the official said.
   It drifted until Friday, when the sailor was picked up by the
U.S. container ship President Roosevelt about 1,850 miles northwest
of Honolulu.
   The container ship was headed for Guam and should arrive there
with the survivor Sunday night.

<HEAD>Garcia is Second Congressman Convicted in Contractor Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Garcia became the second congressman
convicted in the Wedtech scandal when he and his wife were found
guilty of extortion and conspiracy for taking bribes and
interest-free loans from the company.
   The federal jury said Friday that Robert and Jane Lee Garcia
conspired to obtain $175,000 in payments, and a $1,900 emerald and
diamond necklace for Mrs. Garcia, from 1984 to 1986, in exchange
for Garcia's political influence in helping the now-defunct
military contractor get government business.
   The Democrat and his wife were acquitted of bribery and receipts
of illegal gratuities.
   ``The verdict shows that the jury can see through sophisticated
methods used by politicians to sell political influence,'' said the
lead prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Little.
   Another Bronx congressman, former Rep. Mario Biaggi, was
convicted in a Wedtech racketeering case last year and sentenced to
eight years in prison.
   Others convicted in the Wedtech scandal were E. Robert Wallach,
a friend of ex-U.S. Attorney Edwin Meese, former Bronx borough
president Stanley Simon and Wedtech founder John Mariotta.
   The Garcias face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy
charge and up to 20 years on each of two counts of extortion.
   Sentencing was set for Jan. 5. Ronald Fischetti, a lawyer for
Jane Lee Garcia, said the verdict would be appealed.
   As the jury forewoman read off the first guilty verdict, Garcia
reached over and squeezed his wife's hand. Afterward, he appeared
shaken and his voice broke when he read a prepared statement to
reporters.
   ``My faith in God remains strong, so I remain strong,'' said
Garcia, the son of a Pentecostal minister. He recalled a song he
sang in church: ``In the good times, you praise His name. In the
bad times, you do the same.''
   Garcia, 56, didn't announce if he intended to give up his seat,
which he has held since 1978.
   ``In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my political
advisers and the Democratic Party leaders about the best way of my
preserving the interests of my constituents,'' he said.
   Garcia doesn't automatically lose his House seat. The
Constitution gives each chamber of Congress sole authority for
disciplining its members.
   Under House rules, a convicted member is urged, but not
required, to abstain from voting in committee or on the floor
unless he is later cleared of wrongdoing or is re-elected to his
seat. After being indicted, Garcia was effectively stripped of the
chairmanship of the banking subcommittee on policy, research and
insurance.
   The Garcias' month-long trial was the seventh to stem from the
wide-ranging scandal at Wedtech, the small South Bronx machine shop
that grew into a multimillion-dollar defense contractor through
various bribe schemes.
   The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of corruption.
   One extortion charge against the Garcias dealt with $76,000
allegedly funneled by Wedtech through an attorney in Puerto Rico to
Mrs. Garcia's consulting firm, Leesonia Enterprises, in numerous
payments between 1984 and 1986.
   The attorney, Ralph Vallone Jr., a close friend of Mrs. Garcia,
was charged with the Garcias but was severed from the trial for
health reasons.
   The other extortion charge was for a $20,000 no-interest loan
Garcia received from Wedtech in 1985. Testimony showed Garcia
instructed Wedtech to make the loan to his sister, who transferred
the money to Mrs. Garcia.
   The conspiracy count also included a $77,500 investment
Mariotta's wife made in a Benetton store Mrs. Garcia wanted to open
in Puerto Rico; another $1,500 loan from Wedtech to Garcia; and the
necklace, which Mariotta bought for Mrs. Garcia the day after the
Garcias set up a 1985 meeting between Wedtech officials and Gov.
Rafael Hernandez-Colon of Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   Five railroad cars full of rotting refuse
were on their way back to Philadelphia today after state officials
won a court order blocking a plan to dump the garbage in Indiana.
   The state Department of Environmental Management said the four
companies involved in carting the trash lacked a permit allowing
garbage to be transferred from railroad cars to dump trucks.
   The cars headed back Friday after the state obtained a
restraining order against the dumping and threatened to fine the
trash haulers $25,000 for each day the garbage was parked at a
Terre Haute rail yard. The order was issued by a Clay County
circuit judge in Brazil, Ind.
   The household trash originally was destined for the Center Point
Landfill near Brazil, about 60 miles west of Indianapolis near
Terre Haute.
   Friday's action ``is really intended to send a message to
anybody that if they're going to bring their trash into Indiana,
they're going to have to do it legally,'' Environmental Management
Commissioner Kathy Prosser said in a telephone interview.
   Susan Shadley, an attorney representing the four companies,
didn't respond to a telephone request for comment.
   ``It's not surprising to see boxcars of garbage being shipped
across the country,'' Prosser said. ``This really symbolizes a
bigger problem this nation has. A lot of states have never
addressed how they're going to manage their solid waste.''
   The disposal dispute recalled the saga of a freighter _ also
from Philadelphia _ that sailed the seas for two years searching
for a place to dump 14,000 tons of ash from burned garbage. It was
rejected by 11 countries before turning up empty in Singapore late
in 1988, after changing names and owners.
   The garbage-laden rail cars, emitting a foul smell and with
steam rising from their cargo in the cold air, left a Conrail yard
about 10:30 a.m. headed east, officials said.
   The Conrail train was to have left the state by early today,
heading back to Pennsylvania through Ohio, Prosser said.
   She said the train's progress was being monitored and that Ohio
and Pennsylvania officials would be alerted it was heading their
way.
   Mayor Pete Chalos of Terre Haute learned Thursday that the
garbage cars were in his city and organized a hunt to locate them.
Prosser then sent investigators to the rail yard late Thursday.
   The cars had been in Indiana since late last week.
   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling prohibits Indiana from stopping
solid waste from entering the state in railroad cars. However,
state solid-waste rules forbid trash from being unloaded from
railroad cars onto trucks that would take it to landfills.
   The four companies involved in the garbage transport included
the Terre Haute, Brazil &amp; Eastern Railroad Inc. of Terre Haute;
Girard Point Transfer Station Inc. of Philadelphia; and United
Waste Removal Inc. and O.K. Storage Transfer &amp; Cartage Inc. of
Louisville, Ky., said Bettie Cadou, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Environmental Management.

<HEAD>KGB to Reduce Restricted Border Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will cut its restricted border
zones by 90 percent and take down the barbed wire in many areas,
KGB officials told a Soviet legislative committee.
   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said the committee was told
border-crossing procedures will also be simplified. The committee
oversees the KGB and the Defense Ministry.
   In its report Friday, Tass did not specify the area now
protected by 200,000 border guards or how the zone will be cut.
   The KGB is trying to soften its image and move away from a Cold
War mentality, in keeping with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
push for greater openness and democracy.
   A KGB official said Moscow's better relations with neighbors
prompted the move and KGB head, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, said there
was no longer any reason to maintain such a large border zone, the
news agency said.
   KGB deputy chief Vadim Matrosov told the Defense and Security
Committee the southern border _ particularly with Afghanistan _
requires extra guards to combat smuggling and armed gangs. But in
general, improving relations with China, Iran and NATO members
Turkey and Norway, has meant reduced border tension.
   In some places the forbidden border zone is hundreds of miles
wide and even along the Soviet Union's border with Warsaw Pact
allies, Moscow has strung barbed wire and placed armed KGB guards
in towers.
   Foreigners are barred from a 16-mile-wide strip along the Soviet
borders with Norway, Finland, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan.
   The country plans to ``remove the barbed-wire entanglement in
many areas,'' Tass said.
   About 3,400 people illegally crossed into border zones since
last year, Tass said.

   School, work and the
northern California earthquake may limit the crowd of spectators to
100,000 people when the space shuttle lands here next week, a NASA
spokeswoman said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to touch down at this Mojave Desert base
at 12:38 p.m. PDT Monday.
   But there is some possibility that high winds might force NASA
to bring the shuttle back to Earth about 90 minutes early, or one
or two days later, the agency said Friday.
   A weekday landing should draw about 100,000 spectators to the
public viewing site on the east shore of Rogers Dry Lake, said
Nancy Lovato, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``Had the landing been on a Saturday or Sunday, I'd expect
double that,'' she said. ``But on a Monday people have to go to
school and go to work.''
   Lovato said the crowd also might be reduced by last Tuesday's
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``I don't think we'll have very many people coming from that
area,'' she said. ``They have things to take care of.''
   Atlantis blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on
Wednesday, and several hours later deployed the Galileo spacecraft
on a six-year trip to the planet Jupiter.
   The biggest crowd to greet a shuttle numbered 500,000 on July 4,
1982, when then-President Reagan was on hand for Columbia's
landing. About 450,000 people watched Discovery land Oct. 3, 1988 _
a Monday, but the first shuttle landing since the Challenger
disaster, Lovato said.
   The viewing site will be opened to the public 24 hours before
Atlantis lands, and access will be closed one hour before the
landing, Lovato said. Two-lane access roads often are congested, so
spectators are advised to arrive early.

   A judge barred the city from enforcing an
ordinance which bans sales of semiautomatic assault weapons.
   Judge Luther Alverson of Superior Court in Fulton County ruled
Friday for the second time that only the General Assembly can
regulate the sale of firearms. In July the judge blocked
enforcement of an almost identical Fulton County ordinance.
   Alverson said he would grant temporary restraining orders
against the City Council, police and Mayor Andrew Young.
   Attorney Martha Glisson, a lawyer for Citizens for Safe
Government, a gun-fanciers' group that challenged the law, argued
that the local laws are so vague and broadly written that even
sporting weapons could be considered illegal by police.
   Assistant City Attorney Joe M. Harris argued that the city
ordinance isn't preempted by state law because, he said, it goes
farther than any state legislation now on the books.
   Both ordinances were aimed at limiting drug dealers' access to
weapons like Uzi semiautomatic pistols, rifles and the AK-47
assault rifle.

   The family of a slain Ethiopian immigrant
has sued a white supremacist group and its leader for allegedly
encouraging the thugs who beat him to death with a baseball bat.
   The federal lawsuit filed Friday names White Aryan Resistance,
or WAR, its leader, Tom Metzger, and Metzger's son, John, head of
the Aryan Youth Movement.
   Two men who have been convicted in the death, Kenneth Mieske,
20, and Kyle Brewster, 19, also were named in the suit.
   Mulugeta Seraw, 27, was killed Nov. 13 outside his apartment.
Two of Seraw's friends were severely beaten.
   The lawsuit alleges the defendants are responsible for wrongful
death, conspiracy to violate civil rights and racial intimidation.
It seeks unspecified damages.
   Mieske was sentenced in the spring to life in prison for murder.
Brewster was sentenced Thursday to 10 to 20 years in prison for
manslaughter. Both men also were convicted on racial intimidation
charges.
   A third man charged in the death, Steven Strasser, is scheduled
for trial later this month. Strasser wasn't named in the civil suit.
   Members of neo-Nazi youth gangs are known as ``skinheads''
because the shaved head is an identifying feature among such youths.
   The suit was filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith on behalf of Seraw's family.
Seraw's son, Henock Seraw, and his father, Seraw Tikuneh, live in
Ethiopia. The estate is being handled by Seraw's uncle, Engedaw
Berhanu of San Francisco.
   Tom Metzger is one of the better-known white supremacists in the
country. Reached at his Southern California home Friday night, he
dismissed the allegations in the lawsuit as ``nonsense.'' He and
his son, he said, didn't know Brewster or Mieske. Further, he said,
``I don't send people to do violence against people. I never have.''
   The complaint filed in Portland alleges that John and Tom
Metzger, as WAR leaders, sent ``agents'' to Portland in October
1988 to encourage Mieske, Brewster and other members of the
skinhead gang East Side White Pride to incite violence against Jews
and Blacks.
   The Metzger agents, who aren't named in the court papers,
allegedly urged members of the skinhead group to call Tom Metzger's
hot line for encouragement and direction. They also gave group
members racist literature that encouraged them to violence, the
lawsuit alleges.

   Two artillerymen face up to 15 months
confinement for their part in the Sept. 27 accident that killed
three soldiers and wounded 24 when a howitzer round missed its
target by about half a mile.
   Too much powder behind the 105mm howitzer round caused it to
explode near a formation of about 80 soldiers at a rifle range,
Fort Sill spokeswoman Sheila Samples said Friday. Four of the
injured soldiers remain hospitalized.
   Sgt. Edward C. Tyler, 26, of Washington, D.C., and Spec.
Nickoles W. Holly, 24, of Canton, Ohio, were charged this week in
military court, Ms. Samples said.
   Tyler, a howitzer battery section chief, and Holly, a No. 2
cannoneer, are assigned to C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Field
Artillery.
   Staff Sgt. William Beil said the men had been removed from the
battery and assigned to other duties until the outcome of their
hearing. He said the soldiers were not in confinement.
   If a general court-martial is convened, the men could face
between three and 15 months of confinement, loss of wages, and bad
conduct discharges, Ms. Samples said.
   Maj. Gen. Raphael J. Hallada, the Fort Sill commander, will
determine whether the men will be charged with dereliction of duty
through negligence, negligent homicide, or both charges, she said.

   A cold front brought rain and cool temperatures to the Pacific
Northwest today, while unseasonably cold temperatures also cooled
the Southeast.
   In the Midwest, the rain and snow that lingered over much of the
region on Thursday and Friday appeared to be moving away, allowing
a warm front out of the West to reach the area.
   While temperatures are expected to rise to the 70s in part of
Iowa and Illinois by Sunday, temperatures were in the 30s and 40s
in the Midwest early today. Rain fell over Detroit, and snow and
rain fell in eastern Wisconsin.
   A series of cold fronts was expected over the Pacific Northwest
this weekend. The cold fronts were expected to dampen the region
and bring snow over the higher elevations of Washington and Nevada.
   In the South, record low temperatures for the date were broken
in several cities Friday, including Corpus Christi, Texas, 39, and
Miami, 58. Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT dipped to 38 at Little Rock,
Ark., and 41 in New Orleans.
   Snow continued into Friday evening over upper Michigan, eastern
Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, northeast Kentucky, West Virginia, and
western Virginia.
   Rain fell from New England across New York state and New Jersey.
Three or more inches of rain drenched portions of Vermont and
eastern New York, causing flooding and threats of flooding.
   Rain also extended from the northern third of California to the
Washington coast, and from eastern Washington into northwest
Montana.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 95 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Parliament Declares Anniversary of 1956 Uprising Day Of Reconciliation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted to rehabilitate
victims of the military crackdown that followed the 1956
anti-communist uprising and declared next Monday, the day the
revolt began, a day of reconciliation.
   The vote Friday ended a weeklong parliamentary session devoted
to moving the country toward multi-party democracy, and the first
freely contested elections since the communists consolidated power
in 1948.
   The house also voted to disband the Worker's Militia,
established after the 1956 revolt to protect the Communist Party.
   The Communist Party itself was disbanded Oct. 7 and the new
Hungarian Socialist Party, which is committed to democratic ideals,
took its place.
   The new party, largely led by the same people who led the
Communist Party, had backed a motion to disarm the 60,000-man force
but keep it as a civil defense organization, but this was defeated.
   The house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal by house
speaker Matyas Szueros to declare Oct. 23 a day of ``national
reconciliation.'' However, the house rejected a motion favored by
the opposition to make it a national holiday.
   ``Let us be understanding of each other's differing opinions,''
the statement adopted by the house on the commemoration, said.
   Tens of thousands are expected to participate in a peaceful
rally called by 23 opposition groups of Parliament on Monday to
mark the 33rd anniversary of the revolt. In the past such rallies
were prohibited.
   Csaba Vass, a member of the Socialist Party presidium, told a
news conference that his party would not try to take the initiative
away from the opposition.
   In a statement the Socialist Party presidium said it ``rejects''
the Soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and opposed all forms
of intervention or interference in a country's sovereignty.
   The house adopted two bills exonerating victims of political
trials and other reprisals. One bill rehabilitated those convicted
of revolutionary activity after 1956 and pledged unspecified
compensation to victims of reprisals.
   Earlier this year the government rehabilitated Imre Nagy, the
leader of the uprising and several of his close associates.
   A second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized
between 1948 and 1962 _ the period now officially considered
Hungary's Stalinist period.
   Reforms enacted over the past year have put Hungary at the
forefront of democratic change in Eastern Europe along with Poland
_ the only country in the Soviet bloc with a non-communist-led
government.
   Earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaging
a modified system of proportional representation meant to give all
parties a chance to win mandates.
   It also adopted a bill outlining plans for a presidential
election but put off deciding on a specific date. The Socialist
Party and most of the major opposition groups tentatively agreed
Nov. 26 would be a direct election, with subsequent presidents
appointed by Parliament.
   But some opposition groups, fearing the short campaign period
would give the Socialist Party candidate an unfair advantage,
collected more than 100,000 signatures _ the amount needed to force
a plebiscite _ for a referendum on the issue. Parliament is to
debate it at its next session Oct. 30.
   On Thursday the house passed legislation permitting opposition
parties to operate and field candidates in the elections.

   Gov. Bob Martinez was hoping an
11,000-year-old living coral reef could succeed where he, Florida's
congressional delegation and thousands of angry citizens so far
have failed.
   But Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan refused to commit to a
permanent ban on oil exploration and drilling off Florida's shores
Friday, despite a first-hand look at parrotfish and barracuda
darting among brain coral in the waters off Key Largo.
   ``It's a very beautiful area ... what most impressed me is how
fragile the area is and what a resource it is for all of Florida,''
said Lujan after viewing some of Florida's estimated 6,000 reefs
from a helicopter and a glass-bottomed boat.
   The reefs, a key element of a state economy largely based on
tourism and fishing, are down-current from the oil fields of the
Gulf of Mexico and would be devastated by an oil spill there,
Martinez said.
   ``We are looking for a permanent solution,'' said Martinez.
``What we've been able to get so far is year-to-year bans on leases
and that's been very nerve-wracking.''
   The sightseeing tour also made good politics for the Republican
governor, whose constituents overwhelmingly supported calls for a
permanent ban on offshore oil and gas exploration at public
hearings around the state this year.
   But Lujan, who chairs President Bush's Task Force on Outer
Continental Shelf Drilling, said he has to give equal weight to
both environmental and development interests and can't reveal his
intentions before the task force gives its report to the president
on Jan. 1.
   ``It would be unfair of me to make that decision before meeting
with other members of the task force,'' said the secretary.
   Lujan also noted that buying back the existing 73 leases from
nine companies would be ``an expensive proposition.''
   ``People put up $105 million and they have a legitimate right to
it, having paid for it,'' Lujan said. ``They can take us to court.''
   A temporary drilling ban is in effect through October 1990, but
Mobil and Unocal already have proposals to set up exploratory
platforms and begin oil drilling on their leases as soon as the
deadline passes.
   Similar one-year moratoriums are in effect at the Georges Bank
off New England, in Alaska's Bristol Bay and off parts of Northern
and Southern California.
   A bill supported by the governor and Florida's entire delegation
in Washington would prohibit the interior secretary from issuing
new oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico from Naples south to
the Florida Keys and provide funds to buy back existing leases.

<HEAD>First Three Pro-Democracy Chinese Activisits Arrive in Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese man and two women who fled China
to avoid arrest for involvement in June's pro-democracy protests
have secretly arrived for resettlement, officials said today.
   Government officials said the three, identified as Tien
Hsin-jen, 43, Bai Hsueh, 26, and Chin Chin, 27, are the first
Chinese involved in the pro-democracy movement to receive
permission to settle in Taiwan.
   Seven others were expected to arrive later, the officials said.
   The three attended a news conference today arranged by the
semi-official Free China Relief Association, but they continually
used magazines to shield their faces from photographers.
   They said they feared Communist authorities might identify them
from the photographs and persecute their relatives in China.
   Officials declined to say whether the three were using
pseudonyms and refused to disclose how they escaped from China
before arriving in Taiwan from undisclosed European countries
earlier this week.
   A number of pro-democracy demonstrators, including student
leaders, have fled China to escape arrest since June when Chinese
troops rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen Square to suppress the
movement. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people died in the
crackdown.
   Tien, who said he taught Russian in Beijing, said the three fled
China through an ``underground railroad'' with the help of friends.
   He declined to elaborate, explaining: ``Many other Chinese
activists are still stranded in China or Hong Kong. We have just
escaped danger ourselves and don't want to put others in danger.''
   Ms. Bai, who said she was a high school teacher, said she helped
organize anti-government demonstrations in the southern port of
Fuzhou. She said her husband was arrested for helping her escape
but he has since been released.
   Ms. Chin, who said she once worked as an art designer at
Beijing's Central Television Station, declined to provide details
of her involvement in the pro-democracy movement, explaining:
``They (the Chinese) would know who I am if I told you what I did.''
   Tien said he helped rush the injured to hospitals on June 4 when
Chinese troops opened fire on demonstrators in Beijing.
   ``I believe mainland China can gradually move toward a society
of democracy and freedom although this would take a long and
difficult process,'' Tien said. ``More exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait can help the mainland to achieve this purpose sooner.''
   Vice Interior Minister Chang Lung-sheng told reporters the
government is reviewing the resettlement applications of 91 other
Chinese who said they were involved in the pro-democracy movement.

   The end of Exxon's oil-spill cleanup
helped push Alaska's unemployment rate up more than a percentage
point to 7.3 percent in September, the Labor Department reported.
   The rate was up from 5.9 percent in August but low compared to
the 8.7 percent rate in September 1988.
   The loss of about 2,700 cleanup jobs and sharp seasonal job
declines in fish processing and tourism reversed a five-month drop
in the state's unemployment rate that began with the cleanup boom.
   The state's unemployment rate from April to August was the
lowest recorded since at least 1976, the department said.

<TEXT>
   Decisions that will affect how Prince
William Sound is restored are being made by anonymous federal
officials who are ignoring local interests, according to Alaska's
attorney general.
   At issue is the Trustee Council, a high-level government group
charged under federal law with determining the long-term damage
from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, an assessment that eventually will
be used to determine how much Exxon Corp. must pay to restore the
environment.
   The council includes the federal secretaries of Interior,
Agriculture and Commerce, and a state representative, Commissioner
Don Collinsworth of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
   A group of federal and state scientists and bureaucrats have
been working together on the assessment and related studies, and
they report to the trustees, Attorney General Douglas Baily said
Friday.
   But ``their decisions have regularly been overturned once they
get back to the policy-making people back in Washington,'' he said.
``They'll be rewritten in Washington by parties unknown.''
   The Exxon Valdez hit a reef March 24 and spilled about 11
million gallons of oil into the Prince William Sound. Exxon's
cleanup operation in the sound ended in September but may continue
in the spring.
   The council staff has held several meetings in Washington
without enough notice to permit state representatives to attend,
Baily said. He said the council has yet to name a chairman, or
``lead trustee,'' and to his knowledge the trustees have never met
together.
   ``We're still under the direction of a headless horseperson and
nobody has final say, so nobody's accountable,'' he said.
   ``There has been an inordinate amount of time spent trying to
figure out where we are and to keep track of what other people are
doing at meetings where we are not invited,'' Baily said.
   Bob Walker, an Interior Department spokesman in Washington, said
the federal trustees have met several times with William Reilly,
director of the Environmental Protection Agency. He said Alaskan
officials declined to participate in the meetings.
   Baily disagreed.
   ``I don't know that there's ever been a meeting of the trustees,
period,'' he said. ``I have never heard that they have ever sat
down in the same room on this topic.''
   Federal and state officials were in disagreement about the
formation of the council, with Alaska demanding that Collinsworth
be named the lead trustee.
   Walker acknowledged the dispute was over power.
   ``The feeling of several of the trustees was that they could not
operate that way, that they would be yielding authority they could
not yield,'' he said.
   Baily said that while the state and federal officials in the
field are working well, their recommendations are being ignored.
For example, the staff recently recommended a three-year budget to
fund its research, but officials in Washington limited it to a year
without consulting the state, Baily said.
   ``Many times a report goes back to Washington and it comes out
in a different form.''
   Another brewing dispute, with ramifications beyond the spill, is
over who owns the tidelands and submerged lands in Prince William
Sound.
   Baily said Alaskan officials believe the tide and submerged
lands belong to the state of Alaska, but the federal government,
through the Forest Service, has insisted since the spill that it
owns those lands.

<HEAD>Four Former Cordis Officials Innocent of Pacemaker Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four former Cordis Corp. officials accused of
selling defective heart pacemakers from 1983 to 1985 have been
found innocent in federal court.
   The defendants were acquitted Friday after a six-week trial on
conspiracy and related charges in what the government claimed was
the sale of 2,200 defective pacemakers and 6,000 corrosion-prone
batteries.
   Harold Hershenson, 62, a former executive vice president; John
Pagones, 64, former vice president for corporate product assurance;
Stephen Vadas, 48, manager for product administration and Dean
Ciporkin, 42, senior reliability assurance engineer all were
cleared by the 12-member federal jury.
   All four left Cordis, which has since sold off its pacemaker
division.
   The Miami-based company itself previously had pleaded guilty and
paid a $764,000 fine, along with $5 million in civil penalties to
various federal agencies.
   The FDA said the pacemakers could have stopped without warning,
yet no deaths were attributed to failure of the devices implanted
under the skin to regulate the heartbeat.
   Company officials knew of the problems, but sold the pacemakers
anyway, according to the charges.
   Cordis' pacemaker business was sold to the Australian medical
device manufacturer Telectronics. Cordis now concentrates on making
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for
monitoring pressure on the brain.
   A company statement released after the verdict that Cardis was
``extremely gratified'' by the acquittals.
   ``We fully supported the individuals and have always believed
that no crime had been committed,'' the unsigned statement said.

<HEAD>Meeting On Protecting Antarctic Ends In Disagreement, But More Talks
In 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two weeks of negotiations, delegates to an
international conference on the Antarctic disagreed over how to
protect the frozen continent's environment and next year might
consider making it a global nature reserve.
   Representatives of the 39 signatory nations of the Antarctica
Treaty of 1959 said Friday discussion of ``comprehensive
environmental measures'' would be continued next year.
   The Paris meeting was the latest installment of an unfolding
drama about the future of a frozen continent larger than the United
States and Mexico combined.
   A member of Belgium's delegation predicted privately that,
before the 1990 meeting, public opinion will create pressure for
stringent protection.
   ``This is a big day for the environment,'' said Jim Barnes,
director of the Antarctic and Southern Oceans Coalition, an
umbrella for about 200 environmental groups. Although most
substantive matters were postponed, Barnes said just focusing world
attention on Antartica was significant.
   ``There is momentum ... that is leading to Antarctica being
declared a special place unlike any other on earth,'' Barnes said.
   No time or place was immediately announced for next year's
meeting.
   The United States, Britain and New Zealand support an
international minerals convention that would open Antarctica to
regulated mining. They sought to exclude discussion of the nature
reserve from the 1990 discusssions.
   ``We were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted the
outcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position,'' said
Tucker Scully, head of the U.S. delegation.
   A mining convention worked out over six years of negotiations
was signed in June 1988 in Wellington, New Zealand. Washington
wants a meeting next year to discuss the convention, which it says
sets stringent standards and offers the most practical way of
safeguarding the Antarctic environment.
   The convention does not assign liability for accidents such as
oil spills. Two fuel leaks at U.S. bases in Antarctica have been
announced this month.
   Australia and France want to declare Antarctica a ``wilderness
park'' where mining would be prohibited and human activity
carefully controlled. They were joined recently by Italy, Belgium,
India, Greece, Austria and Bulgaria.
   The U.S. delegation has agreed to a separate meeting on the
mining convention. Barnes, the environmentalist representative,
called the planned talks ``victory for common sense.''
   Delegates to the Paris conference agreed on minor issues,
adopting a waste disposal code and extending international marine
pollution conventions to include the seas around Antarctica. They
also created a category of areas to be given special protection
because they are wild, beautiful or geologically important.
   The 1959 treaty set aside all territorial claims to Antarctica
and declared it a region of peace and scientific cooperation.

<HEAD>Rockwell To Close Nuclear `Hot Lab,' Won't Seek Long-Term NRC License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. will
close the nuclear ``hot lab'' at its Rocketdyne division plant, a
facility besieged by protests from nearby residents and
anti-nuclear activists.
   Rocketdyne President Bob Paster defended the nuclear safety
track record of the field laboratory in a statement announcing the
decision Friday. He said community pressure contributed to the
decision to close the lab.
   ``While the hot lab poses no threat to safety, health or the
environment, we hope closure of the facility will allay concerns
and will assure the public of our commitment to the community in
which we live and work,'' Paster said in the prepared statement.
   Rockwell, which was pursuing a 10-year renewal of a special
nuclear materials license to operate the hot lab, will instead
request a one-year extension lasting through next October, to
complete existing work and file a decontamination plan with the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Most of the work at the lab was ``decladding,'' the taking apart
of nuclear fuel to remove the plutonium and uranium for shipment to
approved DOE storage sites. The last of the decladding work was
done in 1986, but the lab continued to handle nuclear material.
   Rocketdyne critics and neighbors applauded the announcement.
   ``That is great! That is the best news I've heard in a long
time,'' said Jim Werner, of the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an environmental group that opposed the lab's relicensing bid.
   Opponents contended the plant leaked small amounts of
radioactivity, but U.S. Department of Energy and state and federal
environmental agencies all reported that conditions there do not
pose an immediate health risk.
   The amount of radioactivity to be handled in the hot lab for the
remainder of its life will be less than that found ``in a typical
neighborhood hospital radiation therapy unit,'' company officials
said.
   The shutdown of the lab wasn't expected to cause any job losses
or adversely affect the company's business, officials said.
   Established in the late 1940s, the lab is near Simi Valley,
about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   The distance between a school yard and a drug
dealer is measured in a straight line, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the claim of
a convicted drug dealer that a federal law imposing strict
penalties for drug peddling within 1,000 feet of a school should be
measured by how far children would have to walk to the crime scene.
   Everton Gladstone Watson was convicted of selling marijuana at a
market about 960 feet from an elementary school, said his lawyer,
Michael Brush.
   Students would have had to walk more than 1,000 feet from the
school to reach Watson, Brush said.
   But the appeals court ruled that a straight line measurement
``creates a readily ascertainable zone of protection'' for children.
   Watson was sentenced last year to two years in prison under the
law, which imposes a minimum one-year sentence.

<TEXT>
   Economic growth was cut almost in half this year
by lower production, strikes and ethnic unrest, while foreign trade
and consumer prices were higher, a government official said.
   Growth was 2.4 percent in the first nine months of 1989,
compared to 4.7 percent in the same period last year, said Nikolai
G. Belov, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Statistics.
   ``Negative tendencies were notably on an increase from July to
September, caused mostly by the weakening of production discipline,
ethnic conflicts and strikes,'' the official Tass news agency
quoted Belov as saying.
   Soviet coal miners walked of their jobs this summer demanding
better working conditions. They also made political demands.
   Local ethnic disputes brought on strikes in factories in the
republics of Azerbaijan, Moldavia and Estonia. Last month Armenia's
economy largely shut down after an Azerbaijani rail blockade cut
off supplies of fuel, food and building materials in a dispute over
a territory both republics claim.
   Consumer prices rose 2.6 percent so far this year and demand
remains greater than supply, Belov said.
   ``There has been a 5.7 percent increase in consumer goods, lower
than the plan, which called for 10 percent,'' he said.
   In the first nine months, foreign trade grew by 2.8 percent and
all but 0.5 percent of it was increased imports, Belov said.
   Belov said the number of foreign companies forming joint
ventures with Soviet companies grew to 936 involving 53 different
countries and employ 15,000 people, Soviet and foreign.
   Agriculture officials anticipate an improved grain harvest this
year, Belov said. He gave the harvest figure to date as about 209
million tons, compared with 195 million tons at this time last year.
   In Washington, the U.S. Agriculture Department said the Soviet
Union was continuing to buy large amounts of grain from the United
States.
   It said sales for 1988-89 were more about 21.7 million tons _
16.3 million tons of corn and 5.4 million tons of wheat. In
addition, sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million
tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums.

   FBI agents have seized a 150-year-old tribal
mask on display at an antiques show that a Hopi priest said was
stolen from an Arizona Indian reservation about seven months ago.
   ``As soon as I saw it, I knew it was ours,'' said the priest,
Herman Lewis, at a Friday news conference.
   Lewis, 82, was flown to New York by the Association on American
Indian Affairs to identify the Wupomo Kachina mask.
   The mask, decorated with braided corn husks and eagle feathers,
is key to the rites of passage to young Hopis, said Leigh Jenkins,
director of the tribe's cultural preservation office.
   Gary Kimble, executive director of the Indian affairs
association, said the loss of the mask had the effect on the Hopis
``like a Jewish community being unable to hold a bar mitzvah.''
   Kimble said New Mexico dealer Joshua Baer bought the mask for
$34,000 and then sold it to an unidentified Connecticut dealer for
$75,000. Friday it was on display, but not for sale, at a show
assembled by the Museum of American Folk Art.
   Baer, who it the ``greatest pueblo mask I've ever seen,'' and
said he bought the mask for $70,000 in April from a private
collector.
   Baer said, ``I did not know it was stolen when I bought it and I
still believe it was not stolen.''
   The mask was sent to the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix on
Thursday.

   Japanese companies, citizens' groups and local
governments have pledged hundreds of thousands of dollars for
victims of the San Francisco area earthquake.
   Both Sumitomo Bank and Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. subsidiary said
they were each donating $500,000 to victims of Tuesday's temblor,
which measured 6.1 on the Richter scale.
   The city of Tokyo sent $15,000 each to San Francisco and
Oakland, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Friday.
Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, gave $10,000 to San Francisco
and its sister city, while Yokohama gave $10,000 to each of the
U.S. cities.
   The Japanese archipelago lies along one of the world's most
active seismic areas and earthquakes are commonplace. The 1923
earthquake that destroyed Tokyo and killed 140,000 is etched in
Japanese memories.
   Newspapers reported other corporate donations which could not be
immediately confirmed because of the weekend holiday.
   Hitachi, the electronics giant, and two other companies in the
Hitachi group gave $180,000, while Fujitsu, an electronics and
computer manufacturer donated $100,000 and 200 cellular telephones,
the reports said. Mitsubishi International Corp., sent $100,000,
they said.
   In addition, U.S. Kawasaki Motors donated $50,000 in
power-generating equipment to ease power shortages in San
Francisco, the reports said.
   Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations, a grouping of
powerful business associations, began a fund-raising campaign for
quake victims, Foreign Ministry spokesman Watanabe said.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party also said it would start
a campaign within the party and among the public for the victims,
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said.
   The Japanese Red Cross has given $35,700 to its American
counterpart in emergency aid, while the America-Japan Society has
set up an account asking for donations from the public, Watanabe
said.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain today accused its former
colonies in the Commonwealth of being ``wrong-headed'' as the
49-nation summit finalized a new strategy seeking tighter financial
pressure on South Africa.
   But British Foreign Secretary John Major said the organization
recognized for the first time sanctions should not be punitive and
should be scaled down if the white-led government delivers on
promises of reform.
   ``We do not wish to hand a broken-backed economy over to a new
South Africa in due course,'' Major said in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   In a separate development, the Commonwealth summit issued a
declaration on the environment which, in a victory for the
developed nations, failed to give outright support to an Indian
demand to set up a new environmental fund.
   Commonwealth leaders debated the South Africa draft today during
a weekend retreat at Langkawi, a luxury resort island 210 miles
northwest of the capital, midway through the weeklong summit.
Malayasian officials said the final communique will be issued
Sunday.
   Major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws on
South Africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers' committee
drawing up the communique on financial sanctions.
   ``We think they're both wrong-headed,'' he said.
   The draft was drawn up after the 10-nation foreign ministers'
committee _ including Britain _ argued into the early hours.
   Diplomatic sources said the draft incorporated the essence of a
five-point Australian plan which stipulates that the Commonwealth
will try to squeeze South Africa's foreign loans and trade credits.
   While the dispute remained, the outcome appeared to reflect the
first signs of concensus on a policy toward South Africa by the
49-nation association of Britain and its former colonies.
   The draft, the sources said, stipulates that a reappointed
committee of eight foreign ministers, which has monitored sanctions
for the past two years, will meet next April to examine how far
F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's new president who took office in
August, has moved toward reform.
   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.
   The commmittee, expanded to nine with summit host Malayasia, is
chaired by Canada and also includes four of the most deeply hostile
critics of South Africa, the black African nations of Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The 10-point declaration on the
environment, approved Saturday morning by the Commonwealth leaders
called for additional support for ``the development of
international funding mechanisms'' to preserve the enviroment.
   And it said these should ``take account'' of India's proposal
for a new ``Planet Protection Fund,'' stopping well short of
endorsing the proposal.
   Developed countries, led by Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, argued a new fund would be an unnecessary duplication and
that all aid should be channelled through the U.N. Environmental
Protection Program.
   The Commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 non-binding sanctions,
including bans on air links, new investment, and imports of
agricultural products, iron, steel, coal and uranium. Britain, the
largest foreign investor in South Africa, strongly resisted the
idea of a list but eventually applied a handful of measures.

<HEAD>Syrians, Christians Appear Near Agreement</HEAD>

   Syria has agreed to relocate some of
its troops in Beirut, a development that moves Lebanese lawmakers
closer to agreeing on a peace plan for their country, sources said
today.
   Christian lawmakers also agreed to a new power-sharing
arrangement with rival Moslems, the sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the final
scheduled session of the fractured Lebanese parliament in Taif,
where Moslem and Christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effort
to settle their 14-year-old civil war.
   The lawmakers would next meet in Lebanon to formerly implement
any plan reached on Sunday.
   Whatever peace accord, if any, is drafted by Lebanese lawmakers
still must win the approval of the militia leaders who control the
guns and the troops involved in Lebanon's civil war.
   Syria, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has been backing Moslem
forces in the war with the Christians and is the main power broker
in the divided country.
   Sources at the peace conference, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Christian lawmakers have been consulting with Gen.
Michel Aoun, the commander of Christian forces, and other hard-line
leaders in Beirut.
   Aoun's insistence on a quick, guaranteed timetable for the
pullout of Syrian troops has stalled the talks.
   The conference sources have said Syria accepted the idea that
its troops pull out of a ``security zone'' around the Lebanese
parliament before it meets in formal sessions to approve political
changes and elect a new president.
   The Syrians would be replaced by Lebanese police backed by
Algerian and Moroccan observers, the sources said.
   The sources, however, said Syria refused a specific timetable
for withdrawing from the rest of the country, proposing instead
that it be worked out by a joint Syria-Lebanon committee.
   The sources said the Christians, meanwhile, agreed to political
changes that are to give Moslems a greater share of political
power. Lebanon's existing political was written when Christians
were thought to be in the majority, but it is believed now that
Moslems comprise a greater share of the population.
   Christians have agreed to expand the size of Parliament from 99
seats to 128, with an equal number for Moslems and Christians.
   The current Parliament, with only 73 surviving members from the
last elections in 1972, was formed under the 6-to-5 advantage for
Christians, a formula imposed when Lebanon obtained independence
from France in 1943.
   Syria agreed to provisions in the plan after Saudi Foreign
Minister Saud al-Faisal met with Syrian leaders earlier this week.
The conference sources said Christian lawmakers seemed ``80 percent
satisfied'' with the Syrian response.
   The 63 Christian and Moslem deputies have been in the mountain
resort of Taif since Sept. 30.
   The sources quoted Faisal as telling the Christian deputies that
what he got from Damascus was the ``maximum.''
   Christian deputies refused to comment to reporters, saying they
had first to ``properly study'' what was relayed from Damascus.
   Moslem deputies on the other hand appeared to have no hesitation
in accepting what was agreed upon in Damascus, with Jamil Kubi, a
respected Moslem deputy, saying ``each party got a prize and
Lebanon got the best prize.''

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady says Bush
administration officials knew before stock market trading began
last Monday they likely weren't facing a repeat of the 1987 crash.
   ``I don't think anybody had an air of panic,'' Brady said Friday
in his first extensive public discussion of the sudden, 190-point
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13.
   As senior administration officials gathered at the White House
at 7 a.m. Monday, the first trading day after the plunge, they
focused on the reaction of foreign markets, which had been closed
during the Friday the 13th plummet, he said.
   ``It became clear as I stared at those statistics that it looked
much more like a technical market change. ... (The U.S. stock
decline) was picked up around the rest of the world, but not added
to. That is an important distinction,'' he said in an interview.
   From the White House, Brady went to the Treasury Building and
personally monitored developments on computer screens providing
up-to-date information simultaneously on stocks, stock futures,
international currency and bond trading, he said.
   The market sharply recovered Monday, rising 88 points. For the
week, it regained 120 points.
   ``You shouldn't look at this loss on Friday as some cataclysmic
event, but more of an instantaneous technical reaction,'' he said.
   Two years earlier, the story was different. The market fell more
than 100 points on a Friday, then crashed 508 points the next
trading day, which became known as Black Monday.
   The Treasury secretary, who as a private citizen headed a
presidential commission that investigated the 1987 crash, said top
administration officials had learned from the past.
   This time, officials were better prepared to coordinate their
actions and statements and had much more sophisticated means of
monitoring markets.
   Brady declined to say precisely what he would propose when he
testifies next week in Congress. But he left little doubt that he
hasn't changed his mind about the steps he recommended two years
ago.
   ``With all due modesty, I might say there's been nothing written
since that contravenes any of the information in the report. So
it's, in a certain sense, a guide to what happened then and what
you might need to do now,'' he said.
   Among the recommendations then was that a single agency,
probably the Federal Reserve, coordinate regulation of all
financial markets.
   ``The more progress we can make towards bringing the regulation
into one place, or to bring it into a high degree of coordination,
the better off we're going to be at it,'' he said.
   Then a Wall Street investment banker, Brady was widely praised
for his report, although the Reagan administration failed to adopt
many of its recommendations.
   Brady, assisted by two Harvard professors who are now senior
deputies at Treasury, concluded the stock market in New York and
the futures markets in Chicago, and to a degree stock and futures
markets worldwide, function as one market because of the speed of
electronic communication and computer-executed trading.
   ``The implication of the conclusion that we had one market would
indicate that too many different regulators for that one market
don't make an awful lot of sense,'' he said.
   Then as now, the Securities and Exchange Commission oversaw
stock and options markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
regulated futures markets and the Federal Reserve Board set stock
margins and supervised the payments system among banks and
brokerage houses.
   But Brady acknowledged the political difficulty of disturbing
regulatory turf that was divided years ago. After the 1987 crash,
traders on the Chicago futures markets and the members of Congress
who represent them resisted any changes in the regulatory lineup.
   ``Those geographic markets have their constituencies and they
don't want to be changed,'' Brady said. ``That doesn't mean that
they shouldn't be.''
   The Reagan administration did establish a working group through
which the various agency heads could coordinate policy, although
none of the regulators have the power to impose their views on the
others. It continues to operate.

   Thousands of people clutched candles and called
for reform during a late-night vigil in Dresden. The government
took a more tolerant line against such protests today, promising to
probe charges of police brutality at earlier rallies for democracy.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the candlelight
demonstration was held after Lutheran church services in Dresden
late Friday. Pro-democracy activists estimated the crowd at 50,000,
but Lutheran church sources and ADN said 20,000 participated.
   ADN said there was no trouble at the rally, the latest in a
series of protests held by an increasingly vocal populace unhappy
with their government's strict adherence to socialism.
   ADN reported that the deputy police chief in East Berlin pledged
to investigate all allegations of police brutality during mass
demonstrations two weeks ago.
   Dieter Dietze was quoted as saying 60 complaints had been filed
and they all would be ``thoroughly investigated.''
   Police used force to break up pro-democracy protests that swept
the nation two weeks ago, but have shown restraint since then.
   On Friday, East German officials appealed to tens of thousands
of those who have fled West to return home. Spokesman Wolfgang
Meyer said East Berlin's diplomatic missions would help East
Germans return home as quickly as possible.
   ``We want to help anyone, unless there are reasons to prevent
it, to come back home,'' Meyer said, without elaborating.
   The message was in sharp contrast to previous government
statements denouncing those who took part in the exodus.
   More than 55,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months,
discouraged by the Stalinist social restrictions placed on them
when other East European nations are moving toward democracy.
   Hard-line leader Erich Honecker, who had resisted reforms, was
replaced by his protege, Egon Krenz, on Wednesday after 18 years in
power. Krenz is also an orthodox proponent of strict party rule,
but he has sought to project a willingess for reforms as long as
the Communist Party's leading role is not challenged.
   Since Krenz's takeover, state-run media have embarked on an
unprecedented course of more critical reporting on economic and
political problems.
   Meanwhile, a West German official rejected conditions set by
Krenz for the possible loosening of travel for East Germans to the
West.
   Krenz said Thursday that a new law would be drafted to expand
East Germans' travel rights but made it clear that substantial
economic and political hurdles stood in the way of letting everyone
travel West.
   Many East Germans say a lack of travel freedom is the hard to
bear in the tightly-controlled society. It has, in part, fueled the
exodus West.
   But Krenz said the biggest obstacle to freer travel is West
Germany's refusal to recognize East German citizenship.
   East German leaders say economic problems also pose considerable
obstacles, because East Germans need convertible currency to travel
in the West.
   Dorothee Wilms, who heads West Germany's Ministry for
Inter-German Relations, said Bonn will not change its position on
the East German citizenship issue and charged that East Berlin
already receives millions of dollars' worth of hard currency from
West Germany.
   ``If East German officials really want to allow their citizens
free travel to the West, then they should use some of this money,''
Ms. Wilms said in an interview with West Germany's ZDF television
network.
   East German marks are not convertible to currencies traded on
international markets and therefore have no real value in the West.

   Gunmen ambushed a police car in
South Armagh province, killing one officer and injuring another,
police said today.
   The Irish Republican Army in South Armagh claimed responsibility
for the ambush in Belleek, about 10 miles north of the border with
the Irish Republic.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
the unmarked, armored police car came under heavy caliber
machine-gun fire as it drove down the main street of Belleek, where
the officers had an appointment.
   The car was riddled with bullets, burst into flames and was
completely burned, police said.
   Constable Michael Marshall, 25, who was married and had two
daughters, died instantly, police said. His 21-year-old colleague,
who was not identified, was seriously injured in the legs and a
shoulder.
   Marshall was the eighth member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
to be killed by the IRA in Northern Ireland this year and the 265th
to die in 20 years of violence in the province.
   Predominantly Roman Catholic South Armagh is an IRA stronghold
known as bandit country by security forces in the province.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   In another incident, police said an explosion Saturday morning
damaged the telephone exchange at Mill Hill, Castlewellen in the
southeastern part of the province but nobody was injured.

   Space shuttle flight controllers
today considered bringing the Atlantis home three hours early
because of predicted high winds Monday afternoon at the California
landing site.
   The astronauts were told to shut down some equipment Friday to
conserve power in case NASA is forced to extend the flight a day or
two to wait for calmer weather.
   The forecast is for gusts up to 35 mph at Edwards Air Force Base
at the planned 12:38 p.m. PDT landing time on Monday. Because winds
at the Mojave Desert base normally are lighter in the morning,
flight director Bob Castle said today that controllers were
studying whether to cut the mission by two orbits, about 90 minutes
each.
   ``We're looking at that option, but, depending on the weather
Monday, we're also prepared to stay up a day or two longer,'' he
said.
   He said Atlantis ``is humming right along. It's a very clean
vehicle.''
   The space travelers plunged into a fourth day of experiments
after being awakened today by a rock song, ``Bohemian Rhapsody,''
by the band Queen. It includes the words, ``lightning, lightning,
very frightening, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo.''
   Mission Control reported the song was a tribute to the Galileo
spacecraft that the space travelers dispatched on a six-year,
2.4-billion-mile trip toward Jupiter on Wednesday, their first day
in space. The center said the $1.5 billion probe continued to
operate well today.
   Controllers also sent the crew The New York Times' Friday
crossword puzzle by teleprinter, and radioed up scores from some
Texas high school football games.
   The possibility of a one- to two-day delay in landing arose
Friday when a weather front, trailing high winds, moved across
Edwards.
   Should bad weather persist at Edwards, the shuttle has two
alternative sites. The Northrup Strip at White Sands Missile Range,
N.M., would be the first choice, and Kennedy Space Center in
Florida the second, Dittemore said.
   Atlantis has enough fuel, oxygen, power and other supplies to
remain in orbit two days beyond the planned five-day mission
without any conservation efforts, said Mission Control commentator
Brian Welch.
   But to be conservative, Welch said, the crew was told Friday to
save some power to enable the shuttle to stay aloft even longer.
Welch said Mission Control wanted to save about 600 watts of power.
   The astronauts' conservation efforts included dimming or turning
off unneeded lights on the shuttle and shutting down one of three
computer displays on the flight deck and one of three general
purpose computers generally left on while the shuttle is in orbit.
   But the astronauts' in-orbit schedule remained the same. The
crew consists of commander Don Williams, pilot Mike McCulley, and
mission specialists Franklin Chang-Diaz, Shannon Lucid and Ellen
Baker.
   Today, the astronauts planned to use a powerful IMAX camera to
film various parts of the world for a documentary film. They also
hoped to photograph lightning systems for a weather experiment.
   The day includes a special event for Chang-Diaz, who was born in
San Jose, Costa Rica, and has been a hero there since his first
trip to space in 1986. At about 6 p.m. EDT, Chang-Diaz plans to
speak from orbit with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   A solar flare erupted on Thursday, and radiation from the burst
may disrupt Galileo's computer memory. The computer should correct
itself as designed, but if not, a correction can be made by ground
controllers, NASA spokesman Charles Redmond said.
   Since the radiation dose from the sun would be greater than what
the spacecraft will encounter at Jupiter, it will be a good test of
the vehicle, he said.
   ``This will give Galileo the smart robot a chance to prove how
smart it is,'' he said.
   On Thursday, two of the crew members spent part of the day
demonstrating simple medical procedures that can be done aboard the
shuttle.
   As Ms. Lucid _ the ``patient'' _ floated upside down, Ms. Baker,
a physician, took her temperature and examined her throat and ears.
The session was taped earlier in the day by the astronauts and
later aired on NASA satellite television.
   The shuttle's first-aid kit ``carries pretty much what any
doctor's black bag would carry,'' Ms. Baker said. It includes a
stethoscope, bandages, adhesive, aspirin and other common
medications.

<HEAD>Government Approves First African National Congress Rally in 29 Years</HEAD>

   Activists today said the government
will allow seven freed black prisoners to appear at a rally of the
outlawed African National Congress.
   No African National Congress rally has been allowed in South
Africa since the organization was banned in 1960.
   Eight prominent black prisoners, many of them jailed in excess
of 25 years, were freed by the government on Sunday. Seven were
African National Congress leaders.
   Activists said those seven will appear at the Oct. 29 rally in
Soweto that is being billed as an African National Congress event.
   ``Apart from being a welcoming party, the rally is going to be
an occasion at which our leaders will be making a major address to
the nation on a whole range of issues,'' National Union of
Mineworkers secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa said at a news
conference near the home of Walter Sisulu, one of the freed
prisoners.
   The black, green, and gold African National Congress flag flew
from a pole above Sisulu's roof. He and some of the other recently
freed prisoners met today with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu at
a birthday celebration for Sisulu's activist wife, Albertina, 72.
   Ramaphosa said the group had not sought government permission
for the rally, to be held at noon Oct. 29 in a new soccer stadium
near Soweto. But he said letters had been sent to President F.W. de
Klerk, the minister of justice and the chief magistrate of
Johannesburg informing them of the plans.
   The Department of Justice issued a statement late Friday night
saying an application to hold the meeting had been approved by the
chief magistrate.
   Informed of the approval during the news conference, Ramaphosa
said, ``They approved it because they knew we would give them
trouble if they didn't.''
   ``This will be the first rally of leaders of the African
National Congress in nearly 30 years,'' said Murphy Morobe,
spokesman for the banned United Democratic Front. ``Comrade Walter
Sisulu will deliver a major address to the nation.''
   Ramaphosa said the group had asked the government to lift
restrictions on former African National Congress national chairman
Govan Mbeki so that he could join his colleagues at the rally.
   Mbeki was freed from prison in 1987, but the government banned
two rallies he was to address, then restricted him to his hometown
near Port Elizabeth and prohibited him from speaking in public or
talking to the press.
   De Klerk said that if there was some guarantee from
``organizations which practiced a policy of political violence and
acts of terror'' that such things would not recur, it would improve
the atmosphere in which the 3-year-old national emergency could be
lifted.
   De Klerk has preached conciliation with the black majority since
he was elected in August. He has promised to gradually bring blacks
into the political process in South Africa, where the white
minority holds all power.
   Several rallies that normally would have been broken up by
police have been allowed to take place in recent weeks.

   Typhoon Elsie headed for China's
southern island province of Hainan today after killing at least 17
people in the northern Philippines and forcing more than 300,000
into government shelters, officials said.
   The Manila weather bureau said Elsie was packing winds of 127
mph when it blew ashore Thursday but had since weakened to 75 mph.
If Elsie maintains its westward course at 11 mph, it will hit
Hainan by Monday, said meteorologist Felio Bartolome.
   A compilation of reports from the Red Cross and the military's
Office of Civil Defense showed 10 people died in Isabela province,
four in Quirino province, two in La Union province and one in
Benguet province. Most of the dead either drowned or were hit by
falling trees and flying galvanized iron roofing.
   Officials added 15 people were injured and more than 326,800
others were taking temporary refuge in government shelters. More
than 5,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged, they added.
   Capt. Donna Eggleston, a U.S. Air Force spokeswoman, said Clark
Air Base had minimal damage as Typhoon Elsie spared Pampanga
province, 50 miles north of Manila, from the brunt of its
destructive winds.
   Wallace Air Station, a joint Philippine-U.S. air defense radar
complex in La Union, suffered damages worth $20,000 and the rest
and recreation facility, Camp John Hay, had about $10,000 in
damage, mostly caused by detached roofs.
   Officials said many northern provinces lost electricity when
high winds toppled power lines. Fallen trees littered the national
highway and blocked dozens of other roads.
   Civil defense said Elsie's winds caused two tugboats to sink and
a British-registered yacht to slam into port at La Union's Poro
Point, but there were no immediate reports of casualties on the
vessels.
   An average of 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the
Philippines annually. Elsie is the 17th this year.
   Manila newspapers reported today that U.S. pop-rock star Cyndi
Lauper, who was in Manila last week for a two-day concert, last
Sunday donated $2,300 to typhoon victims.
   On Oct. 10, Tropical storm Dan hit Manila and southern Luzon on
Oct. 10, killing at least 59 people. Typhoon Angela killed at least
119 people in northern Luzon four days earlier.

   A U.N. spokesman today denied reports of a
firefight between Norwegian peacekeeping troops and Israeli-backed
militiamen in southern Lebanon.
   On Friday, U.N. sources in Lebanon said the peacekeepers clashed
with a force of the Israeli-trained South Lebanon Army that had
kidnapped a Lebanese civilian in the town of Shibaa.
   The sources said the firefight, involving automatic rifles as
well as rocket-propelled grenades, started after a six-man
Norwegian patrol tried to prevent the kidnapping. No injuries were
reported.
   Timor Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, denied today there was an exchange of fire.
   Goksel said a unit of the South Lebanon Army's security service
entered Shibaa to grab a wanted man. After the Norwegian
peacekeepers intervened, a militiaman fired a rocket-propelled
grenade over their heads, causing no injuries or damage, Goksel
said.
   He said the Norwegian troops did not return fire. The militiamen
withdrew deeper into the Israeli-controlled security zone, taking
the detained man with them, he said.
   The 702-strong Norwegian battalion serves with the nine-nation
U.N. force, which patrols a narrow buffer in the southern provinces
of Lebanon separating the security zone from the rest of Lebanon.

   A Swiss photographer today said he saw
decomposing bodies described by villagers as just a few of scores
of porters allegedly massacred by the Burmese army.
   Karl Ammann said he saw six or seven corpses _ mostly skeletal
remains _ but that villagers' estimated there were at least 150
corpses in the area.
   Villagers and Karenni rebels, who escorted Ammann into Burma on
Oct. 12, said the porters who toted supplies for the army were
killed during a Burmese army offensive against the Karennis in July.
   The porters were given virtually no food or water, the villagers
said, and were shot, beheaded or had their legs broken and were
left to die when they could no longer shoulder their heavy burdens.
   It was not clear which ethnic or political groups the porters
belonged to. There have been previous reports of the Burmese army
forcing political prisoners to become porters and take part in
brutal jungle marches, resulting in scores of deaths.
   Refugees, rebel groups and human rights organizations such as
the London-based Amnesty International have long accused the
Burmese army of widespread atrocities. Last year, Amnesty published
two detailed reports charging ``a consistent pattern of gross
violations of human rights'' by the Burmese military in trying to
suppress the ethnic rebels.
   But there has been virtually no firsthand substantiation of the
charges due to the difficulty of access to most of Burma by
foreigners. The Rangoon government has either denied the various
allegations or remained silent.
   The Karenni are among a variety of ethnic minority groups in
Burma, many of which have guerrillas fighting the central
government in Rangoon for greater autonomy.
   Following the brutal suppression of a pro-democracy uprising in
the country last year, several thousand students from Burma's
cities have joined the insurgents in remote border areas.
   Ammann, a Kenya-based Swiss national who specializes in wildlife
photography, said he made contact with the Karennis in order to
photograph the so-called Padaung ``Giraffe Women'' who wear copper
and brass rings around their necks.
   He crossed into Kayah State in east-central Burma from Thailand
and trekked to the Salween River, about 435 miles northwest of
Bangkok opposite Thailand's province of Mae Hong Son.
   Ammann said neither the Karennis he was with nor the villagers
pressed him to see the corpses, and seemed to accept the killings
as a routine matter.
   He said the remains were all found along trails at considerable
distance from one another. Some still had tattered clothing and
belts sticking to the bones. One skeleton was lying very near a
stream.
   Ammann said he had no interest in seeing more than the first
half dozen bodies, but numerous villagers along the route offered
to take him to more killing sites.
   The rebels said the offensive involved between 500 to 600 troops
from the Kayah State capital of Loikaw along with 700 to 800
porters. The Burmese troops retreated back across the Salween after
inflicting some damage to Karenni camps, they said.
   Independently of the photographer's account, a letter from
Loikaw received recently in Bangkok and addressed to another Swiss
journalist claimed that prior to the July offensive, troops of the
Burmese 66th Division had ``provoked terror'' in the town and
surrounding villages by forcefully rounding up porters.

   Indonesia's foreign minister today
denied reports of the arrest and torture of dissidents who
demonstrated during the visit of Pope John Paul II to the colony of
East Timor.
   ``Although they have been interrogated, they have all been
released. No one was arrested or tortured,'' Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said.
   He was commenting on allegations by the London-based Amnesty
International that aboutu 40 anti-Indonesia East Timorese were
arrested and, ``according to reports, some of those detained have
been subjected to ill treatment, including electrical shocks, by
members of the security forces.''
   Amnesty International said the reports came from church sources
and journalists in East Timor and Australia, and the sources had
proven reliable in the past.
   The incident occurred on Oct. 12, when the pontiff was finishing
his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 people in Dili, the capital of
East Timor.
   About 20 young men shouting ``Independence'' and ``Long Live the
Pope'' unfurled banners in front of the altar.
   The demonstrators were flogged and their banners seized. One
banner read, ``Fretilin Welcomes You.'' Fretilin is the
independence movement that has fought Indonesian rule since the
annexation of East Timor in 1976.
   The pontiff was on a five-day visit to Indonesia.

five hours later, left six workers suffering from smoke inhalation,
the Kent Fire Brigade said.
   Both fires were extinguished by construction workers, and the

   A judge Saturday sentenced two Sikhs to
death for killing India's most decorated military hero, who
commanded the army when it stormed Sikhism's holiest shrine in 1984
to drive out Sikh militants.
   Judge V.L. Rukar found Sukhdev Singh and Harjinder Singh guilty
of murdering Arun S. Vaidya in August 1986. Rukar acquitted a third
Sikh, Nirmal Singh, for lack of evidence.
   The verdict was announced in the central Indian city of Poona,
where Vaidya was slain after retiring from the army.
   Rukar said the convicted men should be hanged, but he ordered
that the sentences be confirmed by India's Supreme Court.
   Vaidya was targeted by Sikh militants because he was the chief
of the Indian army when it stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar in
June 1984. At least 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the
operation.
   The Khalistan Commando Force, an underground Sikh group, claimed
responsibility for the general's assassination.
   Sikhs make up about 2 percent of India's 880 million people, and
militants have been campaigning since 1982 for an independent Sikh
nation. They claim they are discriminated against by Hindus, who
account for 82 percent of India's population.

   The attack on the soldiers occurred in Hambantota district, 105

   Sinhalese radicals started their campaign of violence two years
ago, when the Sri Lankan government signed a peace accord to end
the war by militant Tamils.
   The radicals say the accord offered too many concessions to the
Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese form about 75 percent of the country's population.
   Tamils claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese in

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has shown the
Soviet press who is boss.
   First he told the new generation of free-swinging journalists
not to overstep the bounds of glasnost. Then he ousted the
conservative editor of Pravda.
   The result has left Gorbachev in what he clearly thinks is the
best place for every Soviet to be: in the center.
   By accusing the more liberal editors of stirring up dangerous
public passions, Gorbachev drew a line and told them they cannot
always print what they choose. He then demonstrated he could
install his own man at the helm of Pravda, the most prestigious
editor's job in the Soviet Union.
   At a meeting with editors of major publications Oct. 13,
Gorbachev accused them of stirring up the public at a time of great
uncertainty. One editor paraphrased Gorbachev as saying, ``Reading
the papers, one gets the impression of standing knee-deep in a pool
of spilled gasoline. All it needs is one tiny spark.''
   It was a reminder that glasnost, or openness, has limits.
   Many accounts of the session came from Soviet journalists who
weren't present but had been briefed by their bosses. Under the
cloak of anonymity and in the more casual climate spawned by
glasnost, dismayed informants shared with Western colleagues what
they regarded as an assault on the gains they have so recently made.
   Gorbachev reportedly called for the resignation of the editor of
Arguments and Facts, Vladislav A. Starkov, who led his weekly in
little more than a year from a recorder of social statistics
circulated among party members to a breezily written tabloid with a
circulation of 26 million.
   On Monday, Starkov was called to the party's Central Committee
headquarters where he reportedly was given a dressing-down by
Gorbachev's ideology chief and told he had two days to think over
his position.
   Soviet lawmakers, the newspaper's workers and other editors
rallied in Starkov's defense and he was not fired. But the edition
that appeared Friday was a chastened version of Arguments and Facts.
   Its first three pages were devoted entirely to two articles. The
lead story confessed that a poll the paper published two weeks ago,
indicating human rights activist Andrei Sakharov was more popular
than Gorbachev, was an unscientific sampling of readers' letters.
   The article then reported the results of what it described as a
scientific poll of 2,461 people. Although Sakharov found some
popular support among students, the poll showed, Gorbachev's
performance got a favorable assessment from 66 percent of those who
responded.
   The second two-thirds of page 1, all of page 2 and most of page
3 were devoted to a friendly interview with Yegor K. Ligachev, the
sole surviving conservative party stalwart on the ruling Politburo.
   Ligachev used the space to condemn efforts by reformers to
restore the concept of private property and defended the one-party
system in the Soviet Union.
   If Arguments and Facts took a sharp turn to the right, Pravda
apparently took a sudden and equally abrupt turn to the left.
   Viktor G. Afanasyev, the 66-year-old editor who had headed the
official party organ since 1976, cleaned out his desk Thursday to
make room for Ivan T. Frolov, a Gorbachev aide and Communist
philosopher.
   Frolov is said to have come up with the ideological underpinning
for Gorbachev's conciliatory foreign policy based on the need for
cooperation among nations.
   Afanasyev ostensibily supported glasnost but was closely
identified with the leadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev from 1964 to
1982, when the press helped hide the country's problems. He
rejected political pluralism and warned against letting criticism
of party policy get out of hand.
   One seasoned diplomatic observer used a boxing analogy,
suggesting Gorbachev's criticism of the editors at the closed-door
meeting could have been ``a feint to the left before the right hook
came in.''
   But there also is reason to believe Gorbachev was simply
following his instincts and giving the guidance he believes
necessary.
   The only published account of the meeting to appear in the
following week was from Yegor Yakovlev, editor of Moscow News, a
weekly that has spearheaded the drive for more open examination of
the problems of Soviet society.
   Yakovlev said Gorbachev told the group the press has contributed
to setting political passions on fire but has done little to point
the way toward solutions to problems.
   Yakovlev said Gorbachev told the editors, ``You'll come home
after this meeting, and you'll probably say, `Gorbachev tried again
to reconcile the irreconcilable and fell between two chairs.'
   ``Don't you see? I'm sitting on my own chair.''

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode today left a hospital

the mayor said as he left the University of Pennsylvania hospital.
``I feel fine.''
   His physician, Dr. Arthur Whereat, said Goode, 51, probably
suffered from sinus problems or something he ate.
   He was taken to the emergency room at Lankenau Hospital at 1:15
a.m. Friday by police after he complained of a ``very vague
discomfort in his head and neck,'' according to Whereat, who said
the symptoms lasted about 15 minutes. The mayor was transferred to
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, his regular
hospital.
   ``I was impressed with how well he looked and felt,'' Whereat
said today, adding the mayor could work today if he wanted. The
mayor said he would take the rest of the weekend off, though.

   President Siad Barre of Somalia on
Saturday marked the 21st anniversary of the military coup that put
him in power by ordering the release of 1,278 prisoners, government
radio said.
   Radio Mogadishu gave no further details of the presidential
amnesty, saying only the prisoners had been ``jailed for various
crimes.'' The broadcast was monitored in Nairobi.
   Barre, a major general, seized power in a bloodless coup on Oct.
21, 1968, to prevent the election to the presidency of a civilian
opposed by the army.
   Since then, Barre's socialist government has been plagued by
opposition groups. Western rights organizations and Somali refugees
say Barre has ruthlessly suppressed opposition in the east African
nation.
   In 1981, the Somalia National Movement was formed and has been
fighting the government to press for Barre's ouster. Somalia also
is plagued by clan violence.
   Thousands of people have fled to neighboring countries.
   A report commissioned by the U.S. State Department and released
in in September accused government troops of murdering an estimated
5,000 unarmed members of a northern clan in an 11-month period that
ended in March.
   Somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the
north and south, colonized by Britain and Italy respectively.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau said Saturday he
will campaign in the United States and around the world to rally
support for making Antarctica an international nature reserve.
   Delegates from 39 nations at the biennial Antarctica Treaty
meeting agreed late Friday to call a meeting next year to discuss
``comprehensive environmental measures'' for the icy continent,
including a French-Australian proposal for a nature reserve there.
   The United States and Britain lead opposition to the proposal,
urging support instead for an international minerals treaty that
would permit regulated mining in Antarctica. France and Australia
have refused to sign the treaty, blocking it from taking effect.
   Tucker Scully, head of the U.S. delegation, said he was
satisfied with the compromise outcome of the Paris meeting, which
lasted two weeks.
   ``We were not prepared to accept any proposal that predicted the
outcome of the next meeting or ran counter to our position,''
Scully said.
   Under the compromise, two meetings have been called for next
year _ one to discuss environmental measures and one to consider
proposals for establishing accident liability under the mining
convention.
   When and where the meetings will take place was not decided,
although Chile has offered to be host.
   The next general Antarctica Treaty meeting will be in West
Germany in 1991.
   Cousteau, the 79-year-old adventurer known for his television
specials and environmental activism, said his foundation would
continue to seek signatures on petitions urging permanent
protection for Antarctica.
   He told a news conference he plans to pursue his campaign in his
travels to the United States in mid-November, to Argentina in
December, to Chile next April and to Britain at a date not yet set.
   Cousteau said he hoped next year's meeting on environmental
protection in Antarctica would have ``a more active participation
of political authorities, not just the bureaucrats.''
   French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde, at a separate news
conference, said he thought public pressure could change the U.S.
government's stance.
   ``When I consider the state of mind of a large part of the
American population, I think the position of the United States can
change,'' Lalonde said.
   Environmental groups called the outcome of the Paris meeting a
success.
   ``This is a victory for common sense and the environment,''
Greenpeace International spokeswoman Lena Hagelin said in a
statement. ``We now have the momentum to begin the negotiation of a
successful new environmental regime.''

<HEAD>Upcoming Debt Limit Deadline _ Unlike Gramm-Rudman _ Is Real</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional nerves frayed over a Republican
drive to slash the capital gains tax are setting the stage for a
partisan game of chicken with a looming budget deadline that packs
devastating clout.
   The government's legal authority to borrow money expires with
the end of October. Although there is likely to be enough money
jangling around the Treasury to last another day or two, failure to
extend the debt limit before about Nov. 3 would lead to an
unprecedented federal default.
   No one believes lawmakers are likely to let the debt limit lapse
while they joust over legislation.
   ``I suspect at some point in time common sense will prevail,''
predicts Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas.
   But as usual, the debt limit bill should attract a slew of
unrelated, highly partisan amendments from lawmakers looking for
the surest way to get their pet projects enacted into law. In the
process, Congress will be playing with fire.
   ``It's been almost a week since the sequester and the country
doesn't even know it happened,'' said University of Maryland public
policy professor Allen Schick, referring to the automatic budget
cuts triggered last Monday by the Gramm-Rudman law. ``With a
default, they'd know it happened immediately.''
   The current $2.87 trillion debt limit expires at the end of the
day on Halloween. As of late last week, total federal red ink had
reached $2.85 trillion and was climbing steadily.
   If no extension were signed into law by late Oct. 31, default
would not occur immediately.
   But Congress has several enormous bills to pay during the first
few days of November. This includes about $10 billion owed federal
workers and retirees Nov. 1, $14 billion in Treasury bills maturing
Nov. 2, and $20 billion worth of Social Security checks payable
Nov. 3.
   Failure to make any of those payments would mean default. And
default would mean the government would have to send workers home
and stop providing services, virtually shutting down. It would also
face steeper borrowing costs in the future as lenders _ people who
buy treasury bills _ demand higher interest rates.
   ``The United States has never defaulted on its debt
obligations,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady wrote Congress
last week. ``To do so would be unthinkable and irresponsible.''
   Most members of Congress also want to see the debt limit
extended promptly, at least in part because of the consequences
they would face from constituents if it weren't.
   ``Most people are afraid to vote against Social Security
checks,'' says Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore.
   Yet with the contentious political climate of recent months, a
clash over the bill is likely.
   GOP senators were thwarted earlier this month in an effort to
pass a capital gains tax reduction, a move dear to the heart of
President Bush and anathema to Democratic leaders.
   Last week, Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and William Roth, R-Del.,
proposed a new version of that idea and said they would attach it
to whatever legislation is moving, including the debt limit bill.
   The debt limit bill is a likely target for other measures as
well, including several competing proposals to change the
much-maligned federal budget process. Other possible candidates for
inclusion are initiatives ranging from expanded child care programs
to a rollback of Medicare benefits for severely ill elderly people.
   Many of these proposals have already sparked battles between
Republicans and Democrats. Unless party leaders could work out an
agreement in advance, an attempt to attach any of those provisions
to the debt limit bill would be certain to slow work on it.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said he
believed the ``acrimonious atmosphere'' even makes it possible a
default will occur, although he conceded there was only a slim
chance.
   The debt limit bill was once seen as the vehicle for a
bipartisan deal on the fiscal 1991 budget, but bickering between
the two parties has scuttled such a pact.
   Instead, the very item that has poisoned the atmosphere between
Democrats and Republicans _ Bush's capital gains tax cut plan _ is
bucking for a ride on the debt limit extension.

   Suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch is learning
that fame may be fleeting but the FBI is not.
   The nightly news no longer chronicles the 54-year-old diplomat's
walks in the park, visits to his lawyer or trips to the grocery.
The two dozen reporters and camera crews who followed him
everywhere in July and August have dwindled to none.
   But the FBI agents are still there around the clock, in what
they call ``wheel-lock'' surveillance. Experts say Bloch also
remains surrounded by the government's electronic eavesdropping.
   And he remains on paid leave from his $80,000-a-year job in the
State Department's European bureau.
   Still, there is no indictment; not even a public move to fire
him.
   How long can this go on? How long will it?
   Legally, it could go on forever.
   No one in the government will predict, but current and former
intelligence officials see no letup well into next year. Some spy
investigations have lasted more than a decade _ although mostly out
of the public eye.
   Bloch could be removed from the government payroll next spring
under a State Department up-or-out policy requiring periodic
promotions to remain employed.
   His departure from government would not end the FBI
investigation into allegations that he spied for the Soviet Union
since his posting in East Berlin in 1975. But it would increase the
parallels between the Bloch case and that of Kim Philby, the famed
Soviet ``mole'' who penetrated British intelligence.
   The British relieved Philby of his duties in 1951 but did not
dismiss him from government until 1955. The investigation remained
open, while Philby worked as a journalist in Beirut, until
additional evidence surfaced and he fled to Moscow in 1963.
   In the Bloch case, U.S. counterintelligence officials have
enough evidence to suspect him of spying, but not enough to bring
charges.
   Although Bloch's situation is hardly without parallel, public
awareness of it is unparalled. And that has raised concerns, even
objections from a range of observers.
   ``They should fish or cut bait _ either indict him or let him
live his life,'' Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., told The Associated
Press last week. ``He's being punished as a convicted criminal.
He's practically enslaved.
   ``You can't treat people like that in this country, even if you
lose a spy. The issue is terribly important: to have a policy
agency behaving like this.''
   Edwards, a former FBI agent who is chairman of the House civil
and constitutional rights subcommittee, said the FBI should
continue its investigation without the obvious, tight surveillance.
``Their duty is investigate in accordance with their usual rules,
but their usual rules do not include harassment,'' he said.
   A former No. 2 official of the FBI, Homer Boynton, doubted the
current level of surveillance could be pursued indefinitely. ``At
some point, the guy's right to privacy should come into play,'' he
said.
   Assistant FBI Director Milt Ahlerich responded, ``I appreciate
those concerns, but the investigation is being conducted lawfully
and within the bounds of the foreign counterintelligence guidelines
of the Department of Justice.
   ``It may not be pleasing to the eye or the mind, but that has to
be a secondary consideration,'' Ahlerich continued. ``One of the
objectives of this investigation is not to harass but to counter
the possibility of damage to U.S. government security.''
   Former FBI agents say such surveillance is designed to prevent a
spy suspect from acquiring or turning over additional secrets. The
concerns over the tactic are by no means universal.
   L. Britt Snyder, general counsel of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he has heard no complaints from senators, but
observed that ``you can't keep this on forever.''
   Counterintelligence investigations are reviewed annually _ and
eavesdropping every 90 days _ by the FBI and the Justice
Department. The guidelines started in the Ford administration
following disclosures that the FBI had investigated figures such as
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. for decades without
bringing indictments.
   The review concentrates on whether there is enough evidence for
a full investigation using all investigative techniques.
   Based on interviews with government sources and broadcast and
published reports, the evidence in hand in the Bloch case looks
like this:
   Bloch was observed in Paris last May meeting a suspected Soviet
agent after using traditional ``dry-cleaning'' techniques to shake
surveillance. He passed a travel bag to the man, who was later
recorded telephoning Bloch with what sounded like a warning that
authorities were on to them.
   Other electronic surveillance is said to have picked up Bloch
telling his wife that he had accepted payments from the Soviets. A
one-time Viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that
Bloch spent roughly $10,000 a year for her services over seven
years _ an amount that investigators cannot find withdrawn from
Bloch's acknowledged bank accounts.
   But missing from this list is the identity of even one secret
turned over to the Soviets _ and that is the minimum requirement
for obtaining an espionage indictment.
   In interviews, Bloch has repeatedly passed up chances to deny
the allegations, contenting himself with the observation that the
government has not been able to bring any charges, much less prove
them.
   Kenneth C. Bass, the Justice Department's chief intelligence
counsel during the Carter administration, predicted that if the
news leaks are accurate, the Justice Department will never close
down the investigation.
   ``In theory, you can keep the case going forever,'' he said.
   With up to five dozen agents required to keep an eye on Bloch
around the clock, others monitoring electronic bugs and still
others interviewing witnesses and tracing financial transactions
here and abroad, the cost of such surveillance can easily run into
the millions of dollars.
   But Bass said it is ``very, very rare'' for the Justice
intelligence counsel to question such investigations on the basis
of cost, or time elapsed.
   Ahlerich said when all leads have been run down ``you might very
well go back and do everything all over again. It's not uncommon
that you miss something the first time through.''
   Bass and Ahlerich said it would be no surprise for this case to
run a year at its current pace. Later, Bass said, ``after a long
period with no activity at all, the FBI might begin to think about
discontinuance'' of some surveillance, particularly if pressed by
new cases.
   Bass, Snyder and Ahlerich all dismissed the idea that
information Bloch has from working at the State Department would
ever be so outdated that it would be harmless for him to flee to
Moscow.
   ``I can't think of a case where that's the way we've looked at
it,'' Ahlerich said, explaining that what seems out of date to most
citizens is often still very useful to intelligence officers.
   Government officials did consider firing Bloch for cause. But
that would provide him with an appeal hearing at which the
government could be forced to disclose details of its counterspy
techniques.
   Far more likely is that Bloch will be dismissed next year under
State Department policy requiring that officers who reach the title
of minister-counselor, as Bloch did in April 1985, be promoted
within five years to career minister or be ``selected out,''
without a hearing.
   And the diplomat's very public ballet with the FBI would
continue.
   As Bloch himself put it: ``Longevity runs in the family. This
could go on another 35 years.''

<HEAD>Graffiti Gone from Subway, Beggars May Be Next</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was just another subway ride until the door
between cars clanged open and Woodrow Wright entered. He pressed a
comb to his lips and distracted his captive audience with a
subterranean concert.
   ``I am a homeless man. But when I play a comb, I am the magic
man,'' he said, after rough renditions of TV themes and Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony.
   Some riders smiled. But the folks who run the Transit Authority,
which operates the subways, are not amused, and they're pulling the
curtain on acts by Wright and others beginning Wednesday.
   Jared Lebow, the authority's chief spokesman, says beggars and
homeless people are creating an ``air of anarchy'' and bothering
many of the 3.7 million daily riders.
   Hardened by the daily parade of the sick, the desperate, the
mentally ill, the panhandlers and drug addicts, many riders do not
look up as beggars employ a range of tactics to get them to part
with change.
   Some shout. Many sing. A few play instruments. Veterans carry
papers to prove past heroism. Others carry hospital papers to
authenticate injuries. Some have severe disabilities.
   ``In a subway car at 45 mph you can't leave when somebody comes
up and shakes a coffee container filled with coins in front of your
nose and intimidates you into giving money or makes you feel
uncomfortable,'' Lebow said.
   As cold weather arrived _ the time when the subway's homeless
population burgeons _ the Transit Authority warned in posters and
leaflets of a crackdown on panhandling, begging, sleeping, selling
trinkets and playing music on the system's 6,200 subway cars and in
stations.
   Such activities always have violated rules, but the 3,800
transit police officers have been instructed to begin following the
book, after being trained to treat the homeless gently but firmly,
Lebow said.
   ``We know it's not going to change overnight or over several
months, but we want to send out a message,'' Lebow said, noting
that it took four years to rid the cars of graffiti.
   The message has fallen harshly on some people, including George
McDonald, one of the city's most outspoken advocates for the
homeless.
   ``It's a policy that will cause the death of many people this
winter,'' he said, claiming that up to 5,000 people live in New
York subways. ``A person should be able to have a sign and cup and
ask for help if they're reduced to that.''
   ``When it's freezing, people are going to risk the consequences
of this policy and seek warm places to rest. Other people will die.
Fifteen percent of the folks are mentally ill and frightened away.
Police will come after them with their clubs,'' McDonald said.
   Lebow promised police ``won't come in like storm troopers. If
it's freezing outside, we're not going to throw anybody out in the
street.''
   Lebow notes that 44 homeless people died for a variety of
reasons in the subway stations between May 1988 and last May. He
said many of the homeless use subway cars ``both as a bedroom and a
bathroom'' and should be sent to city shelters.
   Brian Brewster, a 32-year-old homeless man, said he found the
subways safer than shelters. He said he was robbed at one shelter;
he was walking near another last winter when a bullet struck his
thumb.
   He said his tailspin began when the woman he lived with on Long
Island cheated on him and he left her. Nearly two years of college
and years working as a barternder or cook are distant memories.
   When begging, he tells subway riders: ``I don't like sleeping in
this train but I have no family and no friends. Nobody wants to
say, `Come in my house, take a bath, or here's a pair of underwear
nobody wants.'''
   He struggles to accumulate about $16 a day, enough for food and
a place to shower. He knows that he raises a stench.
   ``I want a home. I want to be a man again,'' said Brewster.
``Right now I need a shower, bath and a shave so bad.''
   Cynthia Wynn, who said she was burned out of her apartment and
lives with two sons, ages 18 and 7, in a welfare hotel, said she
begs on the trains only when she needs to make ends meet.
   ``I don't know what to say to you ladies and gentleman but I
need help,'' she tells riders. ``I've got my children in a hotel
with no refrigerator and I ran out of food. Thank you for anything
you can do, a nickel, a dime.''
   As one homeless man begged riders for money one afternoon, Chris
Rangel, 26, of New York handed him an apple.
   ``If they need food I give them food,'' he said. He refuses to
give coins he suspects might be spent on drugs or alcohol.
   The comb-playing Wright, who said a drug problem and other bad
decisions put him on the street two years ago, said that after
eight months in shelters, he sought safety in the subways and is
content.
   He recalls making between $12 and $15 by just asking people for
money. Then he began playing the comb, something he learned in
grade school, and found he could make up to $60 in seven hours of
begging.
   Now, he said he ``hopes one day that somebody discovers me
playing this comb.''
   He said: ``A lot of people say I got a talent and should be on
TV. I'm looking for David Letterman. I'd like to show him I can
play a comb.''

<HEAD>Suspicion Surrounds Death of Strike Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leader during the coal strikes that crippled the
mining industry over the summer has been found dead, and fellow
miners fear he was the victim of a revenge killing, a newspaper
said Saturday.
   The body of Alexander Sotnikov, a member of the regional strike
committee in the Donetsk Coal Basin in the Ukraine, was found last
week in the village of Zverevo, the newspaper Socialist Industry
reported.
   It gave no details on the condition of the body or where exactly
it was discovered. Sotnikov's age was not known.
   ``The miners are seriously anxious,'' the newspaper said.
``Could this be some kind of revenge on their comrade?''
   Much of the Soviet coal industry was paralyzed during the summer
when hundreds of thousands of miners walked off the job to press
for better working conditions and political changes.
   Instead of cracking down on the miners as it once would have,
the Soviet government negotiated with them and conceded on many of
their demands.
   Socialist Industry said police were not prepared to say whether
Sotnikov's death was a result of foul play, but a colleague said in
a telephone interview that the strike leader was ``brutally
murdered, with his skull cracked by a blunt object and his face
cut.''
   The colleague, Yuri Boldyrev, who also helped organize strikes,
said Sotnikov had received threats telling him to stop trying to
uncover corruption at the mine where he worked.
   Boldyrev did not say who he thought might be responsible. He
said Sotnikov had three children, ages five, 10, and 17.
   The minister of internal affairs, Vadim V. Bakatin, is
personally overseeing the investigation into Sotnikov's death,
Socialist Industry said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, setting off on
a three-week tour of key allied capitals and U.S. military posts,
says East-West negotiations on slashing conventional forces are
going so well that an agreement is possible ``in the
not-too-distant future.''
   Cheney was departing Saturday for a trip that will take him to
France, Great Britain, West Germany and Italy, with a stop in
Portugal for NATO talks, as well as meetings in Australia and
Hawaii.
   Forging an approach to the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, and discussing with his NATO counterparts the
Vienna talks on conventional force reductions, are high on the
agenda at many of Cheney's sessions, Pentagon officials say.
   In an interview with The Associated Press shortly before he left
on his first major excursion as defense secretary, Cheney observed
that the negotiations between North Atlantic Treaty Organization
members and the Warsaw Pact are ``moving along in pretty good
shape.''
   ``There are still a lot of issues to work out, but I think there
is a sincere desire on the part of virtually everybody, including
the Soviets. I am fairly optimistic we will get a good agreement
... in the not-too-distant future,'' Cheney said.
   While problems remain in verification and counting aircraft, ``I
think we're talking about a year or two at most'' for reaching a
full agreement, he said.
   Cheney said another item under constant discussion is
burden-sharing, and he spoke of the pressures against increases in
military spending for the United States and its Western European
allies.
   ``As convictions grow that Mr. (Mikhail) Gorbachev and the
Soviets ... don't constitute the threat they used to, it's more and
more difficult to get people to allocate the same levels of
resources to their defense budget _ and that affects the kind of
decisions we have to make,'' Cheney said.
   The allies would be ``prepared to allocate much higher levels of
resources'' if the Soviets were pursuing a policy more hostile to
the West, or more intolerant of the changes under way in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany, he said.
   Cheney added that ``while it is perhaps more difficult to
maintain alliance cohesion and unity at a time when there is this
perception that the threat is significantly reduced, if anything it
is more important.''
   The United States allocates about 60 percent of its conventional
forces budget to the defense of Western Europe _ a situation that
prompts criticism among some lawmakers who have called for fewer
expenditures for such economically well-off nations.
   ``We've maintained our commitments, and we are encourage our
allies to do the same,'' Cheney said.
   The former Wyoming congressman is leaving as his negotiations
over the Pentagon's fiscal 1990 budget have stalemated, in part
over Cheney's demands that lawmakers do away with several weapons
systems.
   Cheney noted that he had twice postponed the trip and couldn't
avoid being out of Washington for three full weeks, given that he
was is also scheduled to attend an annual ministerial conference
with Australian officials.
   ``We've got good communications, so we can manage to maintain
our involvement with major issues, the budget, and so forth,'' he
said.
   Cheney will meet with his counterparts in Paris on Sunday, and
then travels on Monday to Vilamoura, Portugal, for two days of NATO
discussions with defense ministers.
   He travels to England on Wednesday, where he will visit with a
U.S. Air Force unit and have meetings with British officials. On
Thursday, he meets in Bonn with Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg and goes on to Berlin and sessions with Army troops.
   Cheney is slated to travel to Rome on Saturday, where he will
spend three days and visit ships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
   During the Pacific leg of the trip in the first week of
November, Cheney will join Secretary of State James A. Baker III
for the annual session with Australian officials.
   Afterwards, he is scheduled to visit U.S. naval facilities and
consult in Hawaii with Adm. Huntington Hardisty, the
commander-in-chief of U.S. forces in the Pacfic.
   He is slated to return to Washington Nov. 10.

   Two months after non-Communists took over
the government, top officials are flashing Solidarity
``V-for-victory'' signs, there is talk of developing a market
economy, and the new labor minister is on TV telling people prices
have to go up.
   There is a new mood and style in Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki's administration _ the first non-Communist government in
an East bloc country. There is a clear effort, in the premier's
words, to ``separate ourselves from the past with a thick line.''
   Take Juliusz Burski, new chairman of the state Film Committee.
He sits in a cavernous office in the Ministry of Culture, the first
time a director, not a politician, has the job.
   He wants to give up the right to veto film projects, sell the
state-owned movie houses, and create conditions to allow private
filmmakers to blossom alongside the state-owned companies.
   ``In my opinion, the film industry should not be managed, but
should be allowed to live,'' he said.
   He ended the interview by explaining that there are no longer
any banned films in Poland and gave Solidarity's trademark
``V-for-victory'' sign.
   Across town, at the Ministry of Building and Spatial Planning,
Minister Aleksander Paszynski talks about the huge bureaucracy and
his plans to solve a housing crisis that can force young couples to
wait 15 to 20 years for an apartment.
   His solution is to create postwar Poland's first free housing
market. He says he is studying the privatization of
government-owned apartments in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Britain.
   Paszynski sees change in government working habits. ``You have
to work overtime, or maybe even harder _ because the premier is
after us,'' he joked.
   Mazowiecki, a journalist and former political prisoner, came to
power Aug. 24 through a stunning political manuever engineered by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who lured the Communist Party's
former allies, the Peasants and Democrats, into a parliamentary
coalition.
   On Sept. 12, Parliament approved a 24-member Cabinet that
includes 12 members of Solidarity. There are just four Communists,
heading foreign trade and the defense, interior and transportation
ministries. One independent, four Peasants and three Democrats make
up the balance.
   But the Communist Party remains a power to be reckoned with, and
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party chief, retains the
powerful presidency.
   Most of the ministers are new to administration because
executive jobs once were virtually off limits to anyone but
Communist Party members. The new Cabinet is dominated by
journalists, professors and that vague designation in the East
bloc: political activist.
   ``The confusion is less than you might have expected, which does
not mean that it is going smoothly,'' Paszynski said.
   In virtually every ministry there are signs of radical change:
   Justice Minister Aleksander Bentkowski asked victims of
Stalinist crimes to come forward so their cases can be investigated.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak dissolved the much-hated ZOMO
riot police.
   Minister of Education Henryk Samsonowicz receives members of the
once-banned Independent Students Association.
   Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski argues against deporting
back to East Germany refugees reaching Poland.
   Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, a born rabble-rouser and thorn in
the side of every Communist leader of the last three decades, has
appeared on television in a denim shirt and chain-smoking American
cigarettes to explain why prices must go up.
   Despite such symbolic acts, there have been some complaints,
principally surrounding television and information policy.
   Mazowiecki made clear he wanted no ``witch hunts,'' meaning the
old ranks could keep their jobs as long as they loyally followed
instructions of the new ministers and displayed competence.
   Mazowiecki's appointee to head the Radio-Television Committee
controlling state broadcasting, Andrzej Drawicz, fired no one. He
did reassign to off-camera jobs three newscasters who were most
associated with the martial-law propaganda of the early 1980s.
   The Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu protested loudly,
comparing it to the 1982-83 purge of hundreds of pro-Solidarity
journalists.
   There were also complaints from Solidarity: that more people
should have disappeared from television screens, and that the style
of presenting news still gives disproportionate attention to the
Communist Party.
   Another complaint, voiced by Walesa among others, is that the
new government is not doing enough to explain its economic policies
at a time when prices are leaping by 50 percent a month.
   Mazowiecki wants to undo the old centralized economy in one to
two years and has been willing to take on entrenched interests
within the Communist Party and among his own followers.
   Solidarity's rank-and-file suffered when the government
persuaded Parliament to limit automatic cost-of-living increases to
help plug the budget gap and fight inflation.
   Another sacred cow, the coal industry, is about to feel the
sting as the government reduces subsidies by the equivalent of $571
million in coming weeks. Some inefficient mines may have to close.
   Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz hopes to sign an IMF
standby loan agreement next month, something previous Communist
governments were unable to negotiate in 3{ years.
   The sharp turn to a market economy foresees heightened inflation
at first as price controls end and state subsidies that lowered
prices are eliminated. Price increases have accelerated under
Mazowiecki. A loaf of bread that cost 11 cents a year ago is now 27
cents and quart of milk that cost about 5 cents now costs about 45
cents.
   But the price increases, far greater than those that toppled
Communist governments in the past, are so far accepted with pained
understanding by consumers. Strikes have gradually died out.
   That reflects the popularity of the Mazowiecki government.
   How long the initial trust will last is anybody's guess, but one
pro-Solidarity teacher said the world might be surprised at Poles'
patience now that they have a government they support.

   The director of religous affairs for the
communist government in Czechoslovakia says his country has freedom
of worship and his office has a good working relationship with the
Roman Catholic and other faiths.
   ``The churches are an integral part of our society, today and in
the future,'' Vladimir Janku, the Czech official, told a gathering
of U.S. Roman Catholics, Czechoslovak emigres, Congressional
staffers, diplomats and journalists Friday.
   Janku also dismissed a petition on religious freedom signed by
hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovaks the past year as a
``normal'' statement supporting freedom rather than a demand for
what is lacking.
   President Gustav Husak has invited Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek,
the 90-year-old Roman Catholic archbishop of Prague, to participate
in drafting the country's next constitution, he said.
   Janku defended the continued existence of his office and the
government's right to approve appointment of bishops. After years
of negotiation, four Roman Catholic bishops were named this year
but half the 13 dioceses still lack them.
   Janku plans to meet on Monday with Richard Schifter, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for human rights, other State
Department officials and Congressman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., a native
of Hungary who heads the Congressional human rights caucus.
   Monday's meetings could determine if the two countries are ready
to begin a dialogue on human rights that U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III suggested to Czechoslovakia's foreign minister
during their U.N. meeting last month. Earlier in the year, former
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said in Prague that human
rights would be the key to improving relations with the United
States.
   Friday's gathering, in the U.S. Capitol complex, was arranged by
the Slovak American National Council, an emigre organization that
until recently was among the communist government's arch-critics.
   The organization's executive director is John Hvasta, a
Slovak-American U.S. Navy veteran who spent three years in
Czechoslovakia's Leopoldov prison, escaped in 1951, and made his
way to the U.S. Embassy in Prague, in one of the celebrated
incidents of the cold war.
   Hvasta said he was surprised by the new atmosphere, though less
than satisfied with some of Janku's answers.
   Janku told the gathering that perestroika, or restructuring, has
come to Czechoslovakia but in a different form from the efforts in
Poland and Hungary to abandon the Leninist model of socialism.
   If perestroika means ``dismantling of socialism, we are
lagging,'' said Vladimir Janku during a visit late last week.
``Ours is a socialist perestroika.''

   When the body of Ramzi Asfour was lifted
from his mangled Cadillac Seville and lowered off a mountain of
crumbled concrete, a three-day vigil ended for his anxious wife,
children and cousins.
   On Sunday, they will hold a funeral, rather than the celebration
planned for his 51st birthday.
   Their dread that Asfour had been among the people crushed when
an elevated section of Interstate 880 collapsed in Tuesday's killer
earthquake were confirmed at 4 a.m. Friday, a day in which 18
bodies were removed from the still horrible scene.
   The wait goes on for dozens of families who fear their loved
ones remain entombed in the rubble.
   The Asfour family's ordeal began Tuesday night, when they, along
with millions of others, were rocked by the 6.9-strength quake.
   When the ground stopped shaking, Asfour's wife, Lily, turned on
the television at the family's home in Novato, 15 miles north of
San Francisco in Marin County.
   In horror, she watched the news reports, which came to focus on
the greatest single point of death and destruction: a mile-long
stretch of double-deck highway that had bucked and heaved, a
behemoth in spasms, and finally collapsed on itself.
   An unknown number of cars and trucks were sandwiched between
layers of broken concrete and twisted iron bars.
   Lily Asfour knew that highway was the most direct route between
Oakland International Airport and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge _ and her husband, a Bank of America vice president
returning from a business trip, had been due to land at the airport
half an hour before the 5:04 p.m. quake.
   Could Ramzi Asfour be buried in the concrete?
   ``My mom suspected it from the beginning,'' said Fareed Asfour,
18. ``When my father didn't come home by midnight, we thought
that's what might have happened. But we had hope that it didn't.''
   Aunts, uncles, and cousins in the big Lebanese-American family
came to comfort Mrs. Asfour and her daughters, 16-year-old Zeina
and 12-year-old Leina. Fareed rushed home from the University of
California at Davis.
   They called the police to report Asfour missing. They called the
Red Cross. They called hospitals to ask if he had been admitted.
And they called the police again, but there was no word of him
anywhere.
   So they waited.
   ``We wanted to go to the scene, but the police said not to,''
Fareed said. ``They said the roads were blocked and we couldn't get
near the highway, anyway. They wanted to keep down the crowds.''
   Two of Asfour's cousins, David and Ramzi Hissen, went anyway.
For hours they drove around Oakland or waited outside police
barricades for a sign of Asfour. Periodically they called in their
discouraging reports to Novato.
   Through the night and the next morning, the family stuck
together, their eyes glued to the ghastly images on the television
screen.
   They knew they were not alone in their pain, and they shared
strangers' grief when TV cameras showed sobbing relatives at police
barricades near I-880. They watched as officials stepped up to
microphones to estimate the number of dead and to voice their
doubts that anyone would be found alive.
   By noon Wednesday, the morbid scenes were too much to bear. The
Asfours switched off the set.
   By then, a swarm of people had filled the house: friends and
family offering food, help and shoulders to cry on. Overseas
relatives called with words of sympathy; Asfour was born in
Palestine and the family had lived in London for several years.
   The company ``helped a lot,'' Fareed said. ``We didn't want to
be alone.''
   Nobody spoke aloud the fears in their hearts: Could the adored
father be trapped in the crawlspace between the pancaked tiers, as
little as 18 inches high in spots? Was the beloved husband injured
and suffering _ or dead?
   ``We just sat and tried to talk about anything _ except what had
happened,'' Fareed said.
   On Thursday, the vigil went on. The cousins, David and Ramzi,
remained at their post near the collapsed highway. Every now and
then, someone would call the police, but they didn't know anything,
either.
   Officers had their hands full controlling the crowds that came
to gawk at the destruction and were as frustrated as anyone with
the agonizingly slow search for victims in the rubble.
   ``It's a slow process,'' said Sgt. Donna Jay at the Alameda
County Coroner's Office, where bodies recovered from the highway
were taken. ``It's just taking a long time to get the bodies out.
We're doing a lot of waiting, too.''
   Late Thursday night, as most of the exhausted Asfour family
slept fitfully, Mrs. Asfour went downstairs alone, drawn once again
to the television reports.
   Workers inching through the debris between the layers had mapped
the locations of flattened cars, indicating the status of the
people inside with spray-painted codes on the concrete railing. The
panning TV camera picked up the painted letters ``DOA'' next to
what appeared to be a license plate number, Fareed said later.
   Mrs. Asfour didn't know that meant Dead on Arrival _ a fortunate
thing, Fareed said, because it turned out that this particular car
belonged to her husband.
   David and Ramzi Hissen's long wait at the highway ended a couple
hours before dawn Friday when they saw the crumpled Cadillac lifted
from the rubble, Fareed said. Officials soon confirmed it: Asfour
was dead.
   ``We were very disappointed,'' Fareed said. ``We were still
hoping.''
   By that night, plans for Ramzi Asfour's birthday party had long
been forgotten, and a Sunday funeral was scheduled instead. The
days of waiting were over; the tears had just begun.

<HEAD>Child Brings Cocaine To Teacher; Mom Arrested On Drug Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old girl who had attended a
drug-education program brought a suspicious bag of white powder to
her teacher, and the girl's mother was arrested, police said.
   Carmen Garcia, 31, was arrested Thursday after police searching
her home discovered 14 similar bags of cocaine, said Lt. Bud Harper.
   Her daughter, whose name was withheld, didn't bring the powder
in for show-and-tell, Harper said. ``She was concerned. She was
confiding in her teacher. She wanted to tell somebody she knew.''
   ``This is a gutsy little gal,'' Harper said. ``I think she's
very brave.''
   The girl was warned about the dangers of drugs in a
police-sponsored drug education program at her North Hollywood
elementary school, Harper said.
   So when she stumbled upon about one half-ounce of white powder
divided into several bags at her mother's home, she was worried and
brought one bag to school Thursday morning, Harper said.
   The teacher notified school authorities, who turned the bag of
powder over to police.
   Lab tests showed that the powder was cocaine and detectives
obtained a search warrant for the mother's home Thursday afternoon.
   Ms. Garcia was booked for investigation of possession of cocaine
for sale and was being held on $5,000 bail at the Van Nuys women's
jail, Harper said. Police will seek formal charges against her
Monday, he said.
   After the arrest, the girl was staying with her father at a
separate home and was expected to continue going to class, Harper
said, adding that he did not know if she realized that her mother
might be arrested if she brought the bag to her teacher's attention.
   ``I don't know if a kid of that age could logically deduce the
things that were going to come about from that,'' Harper said.
   ``Sometimes the consequences are tough, but it's the right thing
to do,'' Harper said.

<HEAD>Communist-Linked Unions Call for Protest of Gov't Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WARSAW, Poland _ The Communist-linked trade union alliance on
Saturday urged a limited nationwide protest to oppose price hikes
and plans to privatize state-owned property, but it stopped short
of calling for work stoppages.
   Union members are to hang banners and posters at their
workplaces and office buildings from Monday to Friday, the OPZZ
alliance said in a statement published in weekend newspapers.
   In declaring the protest, OPZZ cited factors such as ``prices
going up madly, speculation, selling out the national property and
the phantom of hunger and poverty for many Polish families.''
   It said no work stoppages were called thanks only to a promise
by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz that he would take
OPZZ's concerns under consideration.
   OPZZ said current economic reform plans would halt pay increases
at a time when prices are rising uncontrollably. This, it said,
would bring ``growing poverty and the possibility of a social
outburst.''
   The alliance also said not enough is being done to increase the
flow of goods to the market and that the economic program as
formulated would lead to higher inflation.
   Government plans call for reducing subsidies to factories _
expected to cause higher prices initially _ and reducing wage
increases in an attempt to balance the state budget and introduce a
tight money policy. The government hopes that policy eventually
will bring inflation under control.
   Some state property, such as factories, is to be sold off. The
government says the process will be gradual, marked by competitve
bidding, and will take different forms such as public stock sales,
foreign investments or employee buyouts.
   The government has warned Poles to expect difficult times,
including bankruptcies and unemployment, but says the situation
should stabilize by the end of next year.
   OPZZ has called for talks between workers and the government to
win public support for the economic reforms, and the Communist
Party supports the idea.
   ``We note with concern that a number of important decisions
undertaken or planned by the government are not consulted with
social groups or their concerned representatives,'' said a
statement by party spokesman Jan Bisztyga last week.
   ``Such important concepts ... cannot be implemented without
social approval, without the consent of the working people and an
agreement signed by them,'' he said.
   He said the changes require an accord such as the one reached in
April after talks between the government and opposition. Those
talks led to elections that resulted in Solidarity taking over the
government.
   OPZZ _ created by Communist authorities in 1982 to try to
supplant Solidarity _ has always been considered by Solidarity a
hollow shell supported only by Communist activists and careerists
in factories.
   It has been struggling in recent years to establish credibility
as a real union and often takes more militant stances than
Solidarity.
   Although OPZZ unions claim 6 million members, about three times
as many as Solidarity, an OPZZ picketing action outside parliament
Oct. 13 that was to draw representatives from around the country
attracted only about 150 people.
   OPZZ says Solidarity and the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki are committed to reintroducing
capitalis in Poland. It portrays itself as the defender of the
common worker and socialist social values such as protecting the
needy.
   The deeply divided Communist Party, a participant in the
government, has so far gone along with Mazowiecki's plans and
offered only muted criticism.

   When the body of Ramzi Asfour was lifted
from his mangled Cadillac Seville and lowered off a mountain of
crumbled concrete, a three-day vigil ended for his anxious wife,
children and cousins.
   On Sunday, they will hold a funeral, rather than the celebration
planned for his 51st birthday.
   Their dread that Asfour had been among the people crushed when
an elevated section of Interstate 880 collapsed in Tuesday's
earthquake was confirmed at 4 a.m. Friday, a day in which 18 bodies
were removed from the still horrible scene.
   The wait goes on for dozens of families who fear their loved
ones remain entombed in the rubble.
   The Asfour family's ordeal began Tuesday night, when they, along
with millions of others, were rocked by the 6.9-strength quake.
   When the ground stopped shaking, Asfour's wife, Lily, turned on
the television at the family's home in Novato, 15 miles north of
San Francisco in Marin County.
   In horror, she watched the news reports, which came to focus on
the greatest single point of death and destruction: a mile-long
stretch of double-deck highway that had bucked and heaved, a
behemoth in spasms, and finally collapsed on itself.
   An unknown number of cars and trucks were sandwiched between
layers of broken concrete and twisted iron bars.
   Lily Asfour knew that highway was the most direct route between
Oakland International Airport and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge _ and her husband, a Bank of America vice president
returning from a business trip, had been due to land at the airport
half an hour before the 5:04 p.m. quake.
   Could Ramzi Asfour be buried in the concrete?
   ``My mom suspected it from the beginning,'' said Fareed Asfour,
18. ``When my father didn't come home by midnight, we thought
that's what might have happened. But we had hope that it didn't.''
   Aunts, uncles, and cousins in the big Lebanese-American family
came to comfort Mrs. Asfour and her daughters, 16-year-old Zeina
and 12-year-old Leina. Fareed rushed home from the University of
California at Davis.
   They called the police to report Asfour missing. They called the
Red Cross. They called hospitals to ask if he had been admitted.
And they called the police again, but there was no word of him
anywhere.
   So they waited.
   ``We wanted to go to the scene, but the police said not to,''
Fareed said. ``They said the roads were blocked and we couldn't get
near the highway, anyway. They wanted to keep down the crowds.''
   Two of Asfour's cousins, David and Ramzi Hissen, went anyway.
For hours they drove around Oakland or waited outside police
barricades for a sign of Asfour. Periodically they called in their
discouraging reports to Novato.
   Through the night and the next morning, the family stuck
together, their eyes glued to the ghastly images on the television
screen.
   They knew they were not alone in their pain, and they shared
strangers' grief when TV cameras showed sobbing relatives at police
barricades near I-880. They watched as officials stepped up to
microphones to estimate the number of dead and to voice their
doubts that anyone would be found alive.
   By noon Wednesday, the morbid scenes were too much to bear. The
Asfours switched off the set.
   By then, a swarm of people had filled the house: friends and
family offering food, help and shoulders to cry on. Overseas
relatives called with words of sympathy; Asfour was born in
Palestine and the family had lived in London for several years.
   The company ``helped a lot,'' Fareed said. ``We didn't want to
be alone.''
   Nobody spoke aloud the fears in their hearts: Could the adored
father be trapped in the crawl space between the pancaked tiers, as
little as 18 inches high in spots? Was he injured and suffering _
or dead?
   ``We just sat and tried to talk about anything _ except what had
happened,'' Fareed said.
   On Thursday, the vigil went on. The cousins, David and Ramzi,
remained at their post near the highway. Every now and then,
someone would call the police, but they didn't know anything,
either.
   Officers had their hands full controlling the crowds that came
to gawk at the destruction and were as frustrated as anyone with
the agonizingly slow search.
   ``It's a slow process,'' said Sgt. Donna Jay at the Alameda
County Coroner's Office, where bodies recovered from the highway
were taken. ``It's just taking a long time to get the bodies out.
We're doing a lot of waiting, too.''
   Late Thursday night, as most of the exhausted Asfour family
slept fitfully, Mrs. Asfour went downstairs alone, drawn once again
to the television reports.
   Workers inching through the debris between the layers had mapped
the locations of flattened cars, indicating the status of the
people inside with spray-painted codes on the concrete railing. The
panning TV camera picked up the painted letters ``DOA'' next to
what appeared to be a license plate number, Fareed said later.
   Mrs. Asfour didn't know that meant Dead on Arrival _ a fortunate
thing, Fareed said, because it turned out that this particular car
belonged to her husband.
   David and Ramzi Hissen's long wait at the highway ended a couple
hours before dawn Friday when they saw the crumpled Cadillac lifted
from the rubble, Fareed said. Officials soon confirmed it: Asfour
was dead.
   ``We were very disappointed,'' Fareed said. ``We were still
hoping.''
   By that night, plans for Ramzi Asfour's birthday party had long
been forgotten, and a funeral was scheduled instead. The days of
waiting were over; the tears had just begun.

   All the paramedic could see were the hands
of a man and a woman sticking out of the rubble, their fingers
entwined in a loving grasp.
   Beneath the pile, the man's muffled voice pleaded with rescuers
to help the woman. Minutes later both were dead in the ruins of
their collapsed apartment.
   Donald McGlinchy, a high school teacher racing to perform an act
of mercy, survived the quake but died of injuries received when he
fell down a dark stairwell while trying to help an invalid cousin.
   A wife knew her husband was dead when a coroner on the phone
described a ring she had just bought him for their wedding
anniversary.
   These are some of the stories of the 55 people confirmed dead
since Tuesday's earthquake:
   _Diane Laufer, 40, and Paul Harris, 48, San Francisco.
   ``The couple died hand in hand with his hand on hers as if he
were trying to protect her,'' said paramedic Joe DelliGatti, who
found the couple in rubble. ``He was mostly incoherent, but he
said, `Don't worry about me, attend to her.' He talked eight or
nine minutes and then he stopped and we could find no pulse.''
   The couple held on in their collapsed Marina district apartment
for more than six hours before rescuers discovered them. The next
day an earth mover freed their bodies. They were embracing, she in
a black leotard and skirt, her long brown hair flecked with
concrete dust, he in a T-shirt and jeans, his arm around her.
   ``I could see them there hugging each other,'' said DelliGatti.
``That really hit me hard, two people in the rubble together
hugging each other.''
   _Donald McGlinchy, 59, San Francisco.
   McGlinchy, a Galileo High School English teacher, lived through
the quake but hurried to help his ailing cousin, Mary McDevitt, at
her darkened apartment on Clay Street.
   ``He came by after the quake and all the lights were out. He
left to walk down three stories but he had no flashlight,'' said
McDevitt. McGlinchy's nephew found him one hour later in the
darkened stairwell. Bloodied and dying, he told the nephew, ``I
hurt.''
   McGlinchy, a father of three who was about to retire, died of
internal injuries at San Francisco General.
   ``He was a wonderful person. I'm an invalid; ever since I've
been sick he called or visited at least three times a week,'' said
McDevitt, through tears.
   _Gary Watson, 54, Napa.
   Watson, a retired Naval shipyard worker and wine connoisseur,
was working the part-time job he loved, trucking wine from San
Leandro to Napa. His truck was crushed when a section of Interstate
880 buckled, trapping dozens of hapless motorists under slabs of
concrete.
   ``I had no idea he was down there. When I noticed he didn't come
home by 1 a.m. I went in the family room and I saw my mom crying.
She was on the phone to the coroner,'' said Debbie Watson, one of
Watson's four daughters.
   Authorities couldn't find Watson's wallet. His wife identified
him on the phone by the sparkle-cut wedding band she had just
bought him for their 21st wedding anniversay.
   _Donna Marsden, 36, Alameda.
   As she had done for years, Marsden was in a vanpool with seven
other women, returning home from her job in the Pathology
Department at the University of California at San Francisco.
   Earlier, her husband, Bruce, took her to lunch and brought
flowers and balloons to celebrate her promotion to assistant
manager.
   ``She was a stunningly attractive woman ... who loved Victorian
antiques and raised rare plants. She was quiet but not shy,'' said
her brother-in-law Dave Marsden.
   Bruce Marsden began calling hospitals when his wife failed to
return home.
   Finally, he went to the coroner.
   ``I asked if they had anybody from the UCSF vanpool. By the look
on their faces, I knew I had found what I was looking for,'' he
said.
   _Jeffrey Choi, 41, San Francisco.
   A native of Hong Kong, Choi was working as a thimble cutter to
support his wife and three teen-age children.
   Choi was in his car headed home along his usual route near the
Bluxome Outlet where he worked south of Market Street.
   He was buried in his car by brick cascading off the facade of a
building that collapsed on motorists, killing five.
   ``We had been having a hard time in America,'' Monita Choi, 15,
said from the family's home. ``He was trying to work as hard as he
could to raise us so we could go to college. They wanted us to get
a better education.''

<HEAD>Seat Belt Rule Latest in a Busy Worker-Safety Agenda for Dole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration fell so out of favor with pro-labor lawmakers and
its watchdogs during the Reagan years that one senator accused it
of making ``a retreat from safety'' and another critic blamed it
for 9,000 deaths.
   But under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole the agency has this
year assumed a high-profile, calming if not quieting its critics
with actions on troublesome issues affecting exposure of workers to
the AIDS virus, hazardous chemicals and repetitive-motion disorders.
   Most recently, she has ordered a new rule requiring seat-belt
use on job-related drives, a move she said should significantly
reduce the nearly 2,500 work-related automobile fatalities each
year _ 37.5 percent of all on-the-job deaths last year.
   ``A lot of it will be education,'' she said of the rule, which
she concedes will be difficult to enforce. ``Getting people in the
habit of using seat belts is the most important thing.''
   In an interview Friday, Mrs. Dole refused to respond directly to
criticisms of OSHA during the Reagan administration. But when she
spoke of her plans it was clear she does not believe it had been
doing enough.
   ``It seems to me that we really need a recommitment to worker
health and safety,'' she said. ``This has to come from the top. ...
We're going to be fair, certainly. But we are going to enforce the
law.''
   Even her critics within the department give high marks to her
efforts to promote safety.
   In the last six months the agency has:
   _Proposed exposure limits for MDA, a chemical widely used in
construction, that it said would prevent at least 20 cancer deaths
a year.
   _Fined Lockheed Corp. $1.49 million for safety violations at a
California plant where it makes the B-2 Stealth bomber.
   _Fined a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary nearly $2 million for
allegedly violating a previous agreement with OSHA.
   _Recommended criminal charges against two companies it blamed
for a fatal explosion in a Milwaukee sewer tunnel.
   _Ordered 631,000 factories to install locks and other
protections to guarantee machines stay idle during repairs, a step
designed to save 120 lives a year. This rule had been bogged in the
bureaucracy for a decade.
   _Agreed with Sara Lee Corp. on a plan to protect 8,000 workers
in 31 meat-processing plants from injuries blamed on repetitive
motion.
   _Fined a Maine paper mill $1.6 million for 531 alleged safety
violations.
   _Issued a proposed rule designed to protect 5.3 million health
care and rescue workers from exposure to blood and other bodily
fluids potentially infected with the AIDS virus.
   _Adopted new standards governing the use of trenches in
construction that cover 1 million jobsites and are designed to
prevent 75 deaths and 3,000 injuries a year.
   _Asked Congress for $14.8 million for 179 more inspectors.
   Getting the agency involved in preventive efforts is a Dole
priority.
   ``In the past OSHA actions have depended on looking at the
illness and injury data that is reported to us,'' she said.
``That's sort of like closing the barn door after the horse is out
of the barn.''
   One such effort begins soon within the highly hazardous
meatpacking industry, with nationwide distribution of voluntary
guidelines designed to prevent injuries by recommending redesigned
equipment and work spaces and rotation of employees whose jobs
require using sharp objects and repetitive motion.
   OSHA also plans to encourage employers who use hazardous
chemicals to study whether they could use safer alternatives that
cost more up front but might actually cost the same or less in the
long run when storage and handling costs are considered.
   Mrs. Dole defended the OSHA against criticism that it too often
settles for greatly reduced fines, saying that in the place of
money the agency might accept a promise by a company to improve
safety in all its plants, not just the one cited.
   ``It's not just how many dollars you get,'' she said. ``It's
getting the problem corrected.''

<HEAD>List of Missing Shrinks, As Police Continually Check Their List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Every four hours, the 10 officers on duty
at the missing persons bureau of the Oakland police check their
list to determine if anyone has turned up after being reported as
missing in the earthquake.
   ``A lot of times they don't call us back when someone has shown
up,'' said Sgt. Greg Hughes, who heads the bureau. ``When we
contact them, usually they say, `You know, I was just going to call
you.'''
   Since Tuesday night, 250 people have been reported missing
specifically in connection with the quake. By Friday evening, 164
had been located, alive or dead. More than 30 victims have been
pulled from the wreckage of collapsed Interstate 880.
   That left 86 still missing, all of whom, reports indicated, had
a chance of driving on the double-decker freeway when it collapsed,
trapping cars in the rubble.
   ``Most of the calls to us are coming from out of state,'' Hughes
said. ``We're isolating and screening reports so make sure we don't
include someone who just hasn't seen their Aunt Tilley in four
months.''
   Officer Gary Foppiana said all the people believed missing from
the earthquake can be traced to the freeway collapse and most are
from the Bay area.
   ``Occasionally an officer will call us to give a license plate
from out there,'' Foppiana said of the crushed cars being pulled
from the collapsed freeway.
   One of the missing is Melissa Maxwell, a deputy district
attorney for Alameda County.
   She left her office, next to another stretch of the fateful
freeway, on Tuesday afternoon for the San Francisco airport to pick
up some relatives and hasn't been heard from since, said Senior
Deputy District Attorney John Adams.
   ``They found some cars and one of them looked like hers,'' Adams
said. ``We're hoping for the best, but who knows?''
   Foppiana said the count had been complicated by the fact that
some of the dead were never reported missing.
   That's why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a
report.
   ``It's not like an air crash, where people are international,''
said Hughes. ``You have people, working stiffs, living in the East
Bay or the city (San Francisco).
   ``There's a lot of people close to home.''

   There was fallen plaster in the War
Memorial Opera House and the building was unsafe for the public, so
the San Francisco Opera moved a performance for the first time in
its 67-year history.
   Instead of performing Verdi's ``Otello'' in the ornate opera
house beside City Hall, the company prsented a semi-staged version
in the Masonic Auditorium atop Nob Hill. It was the company's first
performance since Tuesday's earthquake.
   ``It was a great experience,'' said soprano Katia Ricciarelli,
who sang Desdemona. ``It was like the (Franco) Zeffirelli film. You
are so close you just use emotion. You don't have to use such big
movements.''
   Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's scenery was left at the opera house,
which still needs several days of cleanup. But the performers wore
costumes and the supertitles were taken along, too.
   The Masonic Auditorium is much more intimate than the 3,252-seat
War Memorial. Even though it has only 87 fewer seats, the entire
hall is only slightly larger than the stage of New York's
Metropolitan Opera House.
   Two more semi-staged performances are scheduled for the Masonic
Auditorium this weekend _ the season premiere of Verdi's ``Aida''
on Saturday and Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' on Sunday. The company
intends to return to the War Memorial on Tuesday for the final
``Otello.''
   When Tuesday performance of ``Idomeneo'' was canceled following
the quake, it was the second canceled performance in the company's
history. The first was after President Kennedy's assassination on
Nov. 22, 1963.
   The performers got just one hour of rehearsal in the new
auditorium and Kazimierz Kord, the conductor, was unsure of the
acoustics.
   ``We are just happy we can do it,'' the maestro said.
   Before the performance, San Francisco Opera general director
Lotfi Mansouri addressed the audience of about 1,000.
   ``We all have so much to be thankful for,'' he said. ``At the
same time, our thoughts are with the people who shouldered the
burden this week.''
   Joanne Dunne of San Rafael, Calif., a subscriber for 25 years,
was impressed by the way the company pressed ahead despite the
tragedy.
   ``We're hearty souls,'' she said.
   But her daughter, Laurie, would have preferred ``Otello'' at the
War Memorial.
   ``I'd much rather have it in the Opera House with the costumes
on stage and the champagne downstairs,'' she said.

   Every four hours, the 10 officers on duty
at the missing persons bureau of the Oakland police check their
list to determine if anyone has turned up after being reported as
missing in the earthquake.
   ``A lot of times they don't call us back when someone has shown
up,'' said Sgt. Greg Hughes, who heads the bureau. ``When we
contact them, usually they say, `You know, I was just going to call
you.'''
   Since Tuesday night, 250 people have been reported missing in
connection with the quake. By Friday evening, 164 had been located,
alive or dead. More than 30 victims have been pulled from the
wreckage of collapsed Interstate 880.
   That left 86 still missing, all of whom, reports indicated, had
a chance of driving on the double-decker freeway when it collapsed,
trapping cars in the rubble.
   ``Most of the calls to us are coming from out of state,'' Hughes
said. ``We're isolating and screening reports so make sure we don't
include someone who just hasn't seen their Aunt Tilley in four
months.''
   Officer Gary Foppiana said all the people believed missing from
the earthquake can be traced to the freeway collapse and most are
from the Bay area.
   ``Occasionally an officer will call us to give a license plate
from out there,'' Foppiana said of the crushed cars being pulled
from the collapsed freeway.
   One of the missing is Melissa Maxwell, a deputy district
attorney for Alameda County.
   She left her office, next to another stretch of the fateful
freeway, on Tuesday afternoon for the San Francisco airport to pick
up some relatives and hasn't been heard from since, said Senior
Deputy District Attorney John Adams.
   ``They found some cars and one of them looked like hers,'' Adams
said. ``We're hoping for the best, but who knows?''
   Foppiana said the count had been complicated by the fact that
some of the dead were never reported missing.
   That's why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a
report.
   ``It's not like an air crash, where people are international,''
said Hughes. ``You have people, working stiffs, living in the East
Bay or the city (San Francisco).
   ``There's a lot of people close to home.''

   On Veterans' Day, 20 years, eight months and
13 days after enemy mortar blew away most of his body below the
waist, Freddie Paul Heugel rejoins his comrades who sacrificed
their lives in Vietnam.
   The name of Heugel, who died in 1984 of complications from his
war wounds, has been inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in
Washington. It will be dedicated at a Nov. 11 ceremony with the
names of 19 other servicemen recently added to the black granite
wall, which carries the names of more than 58,000 Americans.
   His mother, Maggie Heugel of Taylor, Mich., will be there.
   ``He would be very proud,'' Mrs. Heugel said in a telephone
interview from her home. A soft-spoken woman who works the
all-night shift making salads for airline dinners, she still finds
it hard to discuss her son without crying.
   Truman A. Strong might not be able to attend the ceremony, but
the event will be special nonetheless for the Livonia dentist.
Strong launched the campaign to have Heugel's name inscribed on the
memorial and enlisted the help of Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., who
interceded with the Pentagon.
   ``He was the nicest kid I've ever seen ... very easygoing,''
Strong said. ``He deserves to be on that memorial as much as
anybody.''
   Heugel's story begins in 1968 when he was 19 and working at a
Dearborn Heights service station when the draft notice came.
   By Feb. 23, 1969 _ the day his life changed forever _ he was
Cpl. Heugel, assistant gunner on a 105mm howitzer.
   As he manned his weapon in a bunker two miles from the Ho Chi
Minh Trail, a mortar shell exploded nearby, wounding a buddy.
Heugel ran to summon a medic.
   ``Then I got it, too,'' Heugel said in a 1974 interview with The
Detroit News. ``I remember getting hit and smelling the gunpowder
and then falling over backward. Then there was a medic leaning over
me saying, `Oh, my God. Oh, my God.'''
   He was evacuated to Japan, where doctors rated his survival
chances as practically nil. Telegrams were sent to Michigan urging
his family to hurry to his bedside.
   One physician, however, suggested a risky operation that would
involve further amputations and removal of 80 percent of Heugel's
spine. It would mean he would never even sit up again, but he might
live.
   Heugel resisted.
   Ford's office helped Mrs. Heugel catch a flight to Tokyo, where
she persuaded her son to undergo the surgery. He spent four years
convalescing in hospitals, repeatedly confounding predictions that
he would die within months.
   With sheer grit and help from friends, he managed to lead a
productive life despite being permanently confined to a prone
position on a hospital gurney.
   Heugel taught himself to drive a specially equipped van,
controlling the brakes, gears and accelerator with a single lever.
He and his mother drove to the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville,
Tenn., and to Disney World in Orlando, Fla. A Veterans of Foreign
Wars post raised money for an elevator and recreation room in
Heugel's home. He read, played pool and poker, and took up
photography.
   ``We had a great time together,'' Mrs. Heugel said. ``Everybody
that knew him loved him. He cheered up people who came to see him.''
   He also became a volunteer in Ford's congressional campaigns,
driving workers around the district and making telephone calls.
   ``I have an annual family birthday picnic, and he'd come,'' Ford
said. ``People would marvel at how he'd drive up in his van, wheel
himself out on his gurney. ... His courage was remarkable. I never
heard a bitter word out of him, that he had gotten a raw deal, that
anybody owed him anything.''
   But life was difficult. Heugel required heavy doses of
painkillers and he was constantly returning to the local veterans'
hospital for dialysis and other treatment. He developed cirrhosis
of the liver from a blood transfusion, and toward the end his heart
deteriorated.
   No one disputed Heugel's fitness for a spot on the Vietnam
memorial when his name was submitted in 1987. But because of the
strict qualification standards and red tape, it took a year to win
the Pentagon's approval.
   For Mrs. Heugel, the passage of time has made it no easier to
understand the war and her son's fate. ``I don't even watch the war
movies on TV. I can't,'' she said. ``I don't know why it had to
happen. Before my son went to Vietnam ... he never said nothing
like `I don't want to go' but he just said, `Mom, why do we have to
go and fight people we don't even know?'''
   Heugel died May 12, 1984, at age 35.

   ``Nobody Knows the President Better Than His Wife''

<TEXT>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan says she failed
to talk her husband into retiring after one term in the White
House, then argued in his second term that he should tone down his
anti-Soviet rhetoric.
   Mrs. Reagan discusses some of her disagreements with former
President Reagan and his advisers in her new book, ``My Turn,''
coauthored with William Nowak and scheduled for publication Friday
by Random House.
   She makes light of her influence at times but leaves no doubt
that she expressed herself strongly on many personnel and other
decisions of Reagan's administration.
   ``Had it been up to me,'' she writes, ``Ronald Reagan might well
have been a one-term president.''
   She says that in 1983, missing her friends and her home in
California and concerned for her husband's safety after one attempt
on his life, she tried to persuade him not to run again.
   Reagan was determined to seek re-election so that he could work
for his policies for another four years and because he believed it
had been too long since a president had served a full two terms,
she says.
   ``In the end,'' she writes, ``it was just a matter of convincing
me.''
   The former first lady says her husband was never a
``warmonger,'' but ``his calling the Soviet Union an evil empire
was not particularly helpful in establishing a dialogue with the
other side.''
   ``The world had become too small for the two superpowers not to
be on speaking terms, and unless that old perception about Ronnie
could be revised, nothing positive was likely to happen,'' she
writes.
   ``Some of his advisers wanted him to keep up the tough rhetoric,
but I argued against it and suggested that he tone it down. As
always, Ronnie listened to various points of view and then made the
decision that he thought was best.''
   Many of the stories Mrs. Reagan tells have been told before from
different perspectives, but the book gives some new insights into
the view of the Reagan administration and the presidency from the
East Wing, where the first lady's office is located.
   ``The West Wing has traditionally seen itself as the sole center
of power, and the men surrounding the president have resented any
assertion of independence and autonomy on the part of the first
lady,'' she writes. ``But it doesn't have to be that way. After
all, nobody knows the president better than his wife.''
   Mrs. Reagan says she believes acceptance of her advice might
have saved the president trouble in several instances.
   She says Reagan did not ask her opinion of David Stockman, the
White House budget director who expressed his misgivings about the
Reagan administration economic plan in a 1981 magazine article. But
she says she gave it to him anyway.
   ``Had it been up to me, Stockman would have been out on the
street that afternoon,'' she writes. ``But Ronnie can be stubborn,
and he insisted on keeping Stockman. I believed then, and I believe
now, that this was a serious mistake.''
   She says she and the president also disagreed about Secretary of
Labor Raymond Donovan, who resigned after being indicted on fraud
and larceny charges of which he was later acquitted. He had done
nothing wrong, she says, ``but as I told Ronnie on any number of
occasions, it would have been better for everyone if he'd stepped
down earlier.''
   Mrs. Reagan says that after White House Chief of Staff Donald T.
Regan came under fire for his handling of the Iran-Contra crisis,
``I told Ronnie repeatedly that he should be fired. But it was many
months before Ronnie took that advice.''
   Mrs. Reagan defends her practice of consulting an astrologer,
which was revealed by Regan in his White House memoirs. She also
says that when the president found about it he told her, ``If it
makes you feel better, go ahead and do it. But be careful. It might
look a little odd if it ever came out.''

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Dole began the debate over raising
the 55 mph speed limit by stressing safety. But in the privacy of
the Reagan White House, the debate turned to states rights, budget
worries and election-year politics.
   ``Mr. (Edwin) Meese felt this is a good issue to put off until
December or politically we will be seen as raising the speed
limit,'' read the final paragraph of the minutes of the July 1986
session in the Roosevelt Room, and the words from the attorney
general settled the issue.
   The minutes, and scores of others detailing Reagan's domestic
and economic policy councils, were recently released under the
Freedom of Information Act.
   The hundreds of pages offer a behind-the-scenes look at how
officials weighed ideology and politics in setting policy on issues
from AIDS to the government's petroleum reserves to establishment
of minimum government standards for toaster ovens and other
household appliances.
   They also show Reagan aides could become exasperated by public
criticism.
   ``The public often does not recognize that environmental
protection can conflict with other social goals,'' Environmental
Protection Agency chief Lee Thomas said in one council memo.
``There are unrealistic expectations of what we can and should
achieve.''
   The debate over the speed limit on July 24, 1986, went this way,
according to the notes:
   Mrs. Dole, then transportation secretary, began by saying a
higher speed limit no doubt would lead to increased highway deaths.
But she said she believed the administration should support raising
it to 65 mph on rural highways.
   Budget Director James Miller thanked her for her analysis and
then promptly disagreed, saying outright repeal of the national
limit was the best course because the federal government had no
business setting speed limits.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's conservative top economic
adviser, concurred and said safety was not the sole issue.
   ``Mr. Sprinkel said that if we believe in federalism we should
leave speed to the states and let the consumers decide the speed
they will travel,'' according to the minutes. ``He felt the 55 mph
limit is bad regulatory policy and that we need to be sensitive to
costs as well as safety.''
   In principle, Bill Brock and Donald P. Hodel, secretaries of
labor and interior, agreed. But then they talked politics.
   Hodel ``said if we support a federal limit of 65 mph we could be
held responsible for increased deaths,'' the minutes read. Added
Brock: ``If we are wrong on this issue we can lose votes.''
   Attorney General Meese had heard enough. As chairman of the
group, he deferred the decision to another day.
   Congress and the White House ultimately agreed to the 65 mph
rural limit. But that didn't come until after the 1986 elections, a
reflection of White House concern over bucking polls that showed
opverwhelming public support for the 55 mph limit in effect since
the energy crisis of the 1970s.
   The minutes, included in the recently released files of the top
aide to former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce, show that the most
frequent topics of discussion at the domestic policy sessions from
1985 through 1987 were Reagan's drug policy and how the
administration should respond to the AIDS epidemic.
   The council considered a virtually identical memo on AIDS more
than a half-dozen times.
   In November 1985 the first paragraph said 14,000 AIDS cases had
been diagnosed in the United States; by May 1987 the number had
grown to 35,000 and the advisers thought it time to name a
presidential commission.
   Invariably the potential political impact at home and abroad of
suggested policies was discussed.
   On one occasion, in December 1985, top Cabinet members were
discussing a plan to retaliate against Japan for unfair trade
practices when Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Japanese
Prime Minister Nakasone had asked that the action at least be
delayed two weeks until the Japanese parliament adjourned.
   The Reagan advisers agreed, and Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III said the administration would need ``a public line'' if
asked to explain the delay. Although the administration had a plan
in hand, Baker, according to the minutes, said official position
would be that it was just drafting one.
   The topics of the power policy sessions weren't always so
weighty.
   For a February 1987 meeting the subject was the ``AppliancEhis
day.
   Instead, a memo to the advisers suggested the administration
take a stand because under the bill, ``90 percent of current
frost-free refrigerators could no longer be sold.''
   They decided on a classic Washington course of action _
suggesting amendments to relax the standards and recommending the
president sign the bill if it were altered.

   A rocket ripped through the roof of a
dining hall at a textile mill during lunch Saturday, killing five
people and injuring 26, workers said. Four more people were
reported killed in other rocket attacks.
   The government said at least 13 missiles struck targets
throughout the city. Witness reports said two rockets landed near a
government military base used to fire Soviet-made Scud missiles. It
was not known if the base, in the mountains outside Kabul, was hit.
   Meanwhile, a government source said Moslem rebels had pushed
back government troops in heavy fighting near the southeastern city
of Khost. He said the U.S.-backed rebels had taken several military
posts on the outskirts of the town.
   Fierce fighting and heavy rebel artillery also has forced the
closing of the Khost airport, which was being used to supply the
government troops, he said. A government convoy of more than 200
trucks headed toward Khost with ammunition, weapons and other
supplies was attacked before it could reach the city, according to
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rebels have been fighting the Soviet-backed government 11 years
to set up an Islamic republic in Afghanistan.
   They have been trying since the summer to Khost. The offensive
followed the rebels' failure to seize the eastern city of
Jalalabad, which they had hoped to use as a base for operations
inside Afghanistan.
   Khost is 25 miles from the Pakistan border, where the rebels are
based.
   In Kabul, a rocket slammed into the dining hall of the Guzagur
Textile Mill at 11:45 a.m., said Gulam Haida, the factory manager.
   Workers were eating lunch when the rocket pierced the corrugated
tin roof and sprayed shrapnel around the room. Two men and three
women were killed immediately and another 26 people were rushed to
hospitals, said Haida. All of the people in the room were either
injured or killed, he said.
   ``How could anyone escape?'' he said. ``It happened like
lightning.''
   At dusk, the dining room was in shambles. Pieces of roof and
ceiling hung from wood rafters. Tables and chairs lay in disarray.
Blood stained the packed dirt floor.
   ``We are all poor people. We don't want any more rockets,'' said
Shaida Roh, who has worked at the factory 23 years.
   More than 350 people have been killed and 800 injured since June
in frequent rocket attacks on Kabul. The government blames the
rebels for the attacks, but the rebels say the government is
rocketing its own people to make the guerrillas look bad.
   For the last four days, rocket attacks on Kabul's international
airport have forced the cancellation of several civilian flights,
officials and diplomats say. Rocket attacks Thursday shut down
civilian service for several hours.
   The government source said intermittent attacks Friday and
Saturday also affected the transport of goods into Afghanistan from
the Soviet Union.
   Diplomats in Pakistan and Kabul have said the Soviet Union is
undertaking a large airlift of military and food supplies for the
Afghan army.
   Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in February after a
decade-long intervention in the war.

   A jury awarded $5.1 million in damages to an
8-year-old and his parents, who sued the child's pediatrician
charging that his treatment of their son's broken arm caused the
boy to lose the use of the arm.
   C. Stephen Hauptli broke his left arm five years ago after
falling off his parents' brass bed and catching his arm in the
footboard, according to state district court records.
   Dr. George Monroe and an orthopedic consultant, Dr. Harry Dubow,
treated the boy at Humana Hospital-Medical City Dallas.
   The Dallas County jury found last week that despite the child's
screams and fever, the doctors failed to detect complications
resulting from a decrease of blood flow in the injured arm. This
resulted in a permanent deterioration and loss of muscle use or
movement.
   Dubow and the hospital's parent company, Humana Health Care,
recently settled out of court with the plaintiffs for $700,000.

   In 15 seconds, as deep, jagged fissures cut
through the Santa Cruz Mountains and earthquake waves rocked a
World Series crowd, euphoria turned to fear and life may have
changed forever for millions of Californians.
   It came without warning. The only sound, close to the mile-wide,
25-mile-long ruptures along the San Andreas Fault, seemed like
distant thunder in the mountains _ until the cruel, random
destruction began.
   Then there were the sickening sounds of crashing cars, broken
glass, and crumbling houses.
   Fifteen seconds. Time enough to kill dozens, injure thousands,
displace more than 10,000 people and wreak billions of dollars
worth of damage. Time enough to send a jolt up and down the state
and across the valleys and deserts.
   In the first five seconds, the heart, and perhaps the soul, of
picturesque Santa Cruz were destroyed. Hundred-year-old homes,
survivors of the 1906 Great Quake, gone. Quaint downtown shops
reduced to rubble. Longtime residents stunned, and many later would
talk about leaving a city prized for its free-spirited lifestyle,
surfing beaches and historic boardwalk.
   About 10 seconds later, the towering Bay Bridge _ symbol of a
World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics
that had infused the Bay area with giddiness and pride _ partially
collapsed and a section of Interstate 880 came smashing down on
rush-hour commuters.
   Candlestick Park, where 62,000 fans waited for the start of Game
3 of the Series, quivered violently but didn't fall. Amazingly,
there was no panic, no stampede for the exits. Indeed, a wild roar
erupted from the fans who took the quake as an omen of the Giants'
comeback from two losses.
   At the same moment, beautiful apartment buildings and condos,
worth millions of dollars, tumbled or caught fire in San Francisco
on the soft landfill in the Marina district, a mile from
Fisherman's Wharf. Luxury cars were crushed by the bricks and
debris. Remnants of the good life lay on the sidewalks and littered
streets _ stereos, VCRS, skis, golf clubs, carried out by desperate
residents trying to salvage whatever they could.
   Oakland's ornate City Hall was rendered unusable, along with a
dozen other buildings. Homes and businesses in Silicon Valley, the
high-tech center of the nation located between Santa Cruz and San
Francisco, somehow escaped with relatively little damage.
Skyscrapers in the cities swayed but didn't fall.
   When the quake struck, it was the start of ``happy hour'' in
many restaurants and bars, and patrons were gathered to watch the
Series when suddenly bottles and glasses and mirrors flew in every
direction.
   Children waiting to be picked up from day care centers began
wailing as they tumbled among the scattering toys.
   Water sloshed out of pools, dishes fell, liquor stores and
supermarkets had bottles and groceries splattered on the floor.
   No one who survived those 15 seconds of terror at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17, 1989, is likely to forget where he or she was, just as
those who lived through the Great Quake of 1906 never forgot what
happened to them.
   Whether they were injured, suffered damage to their homes or
businesses or the losses of friends or relatives, the survivors
must live with the memory of the event and the fear it could happen
again on an even larger scale.
   They are trying to return to normal life, but it is difficult
when the evidence of ruin is so widespread and more than 1,500
aftershocks have hit since.
   ``This is one of those events, like the Kennedy assassination,
that almost everyone who lived through it will remember in
detail,'' said Dr. Donald Tarver, a psychiatrist with the Mission
Crisis unit in San Francisco. ``It had a life-changing context for
those who lost homes or loved ones and it could have life-changing
consequences for many others who shared in an event with such a
wide impact.''
   It all began 10 miles underground in the mountains along the San
Andreas Fault, the boundary between the North American and Pacific
tectonic plates, which move sideways to each other at the rate of
two inches a year.
   The fault, straight in some places, curves like the letter ``S''
in the Santa Cruz area, 57 miles south of San Francisco, causing
both horizontal motions and compression, according to Robert
Uhrhammer, research seismologist for the University of
California-Berkeley Seismographic Station.
   On Tuesday, when the strain exceeded the strength of the rock,
the earth's crust ruptured, unleashing a force that Uhrhammer said
was equivalent to about 30 million tons of high explosives _ nearly
10 times the total of explosive power of all bombs in World War II,
including the two atomic bombs.
   Compression waves shot out in all directions at the rate of
18,000 mph, followed by the more damaging horizontal shear waves
traveling at 10,800 mph and elliptically shaped waves going 7,800
mph.
   Unlike the narrow, 270-mile-long split from the 1906 quake in
the same region, the new quake caused many cracks, fractures,
slides and slumps along a broader, shorter zone.

   The Berkeley station's instruments measured the magnitude of
Tuesday's quake at 7 on the Richter scale, a bit more than the 6.9
magnitude registered on the Alaska-based seismograph of the U.S.
Geological Survey. In a few weeks, scientists from around the world
will meet to compare notes and tag the quake with its official
reading.
   When the quake hit Candlestick, Giants center fielder Brett
Butler was stretching down the right-field line. The first thing he
saw was the lights blinking off one by one.
   ``I thought there was a ceremony they hadn't told us about and I
expected to see the Blue Angels parachute down near home plate,''
he said. ``Then I heard the crowd and I knew something was up. Then
I felt the ground start rolling.''
   A few miles away, in the tube under the bay, Anthony Ramsey of
Hayward couldn't understand why his train was suddenly dark and
standing still.
   ``Nobody told us what was going on,'' Ramsey said. ``We waited
around about an hour until it started back up. Nobody panicked but
we were all upset. I would rather have known what was happening.
But maybe it was better that way. It might have panicked people to
know they were in the tube during a big quake.''
   The quake knocked down power lines and cut electricity supplies
to more than 1 million customers, including all of San Francisco.
   At that same moment, the worst disaster occurred across the bay
in Oakland when a mile-long stretch of the elevated portion of
Interstate 880 buckled and crumbled. Cars on top plunged downward
and those on the bottom were buried under tons of concrete and
twisted steel.
   Among those killed on the highway were five women employees of
the University of California at San Francisco, who were traveling
home to Alameda in a carpool van. ``They were just five minutes
from home,'' said Bruce Marsden, husband of one of the van's
victims, Donna Marsden.
   On the Bay Bridge, a section of the upper deck dropped down like
a trap door. One woman tried to race her car across the gap but her
car plunged down and smashed into the hanging slab of roadway. She
died later of massive injuries.
   The capricious nature of the quake's death toll claimed young
and old.
   Scott Dickinson, a 3{-month-old infant, was killed in the
collapse of a building in the Marina. Only minutes before, his
father, Walter, had waved good-bye to his wife and son and pedaled
off on a bike ride. when he returned, his son was dead and his wife
seriously injured.
   Diane Laufer, 40, and Paul Harris, 48, of San Francisco died in
a crush of rubble in the city.
   ``The couple died hand in hand with his hand on hers as if he
were trying to protect her,'' said paramedic Joe DelliGatti. ``She
died first. He said a few more words and then died.''
   Len Jann, a Bay Area Rapid Transit station agent, observed with
a sense of hope that the 15 seconds of the quake may have claimed
many lives but also created a special bond among those who lived
through it.
   ``The scene that is most vivid in my mind is when we were
walking up the stairs at night to take some women to the ferry and
we saw these waves of people walking down Market Street,'' he said.
``They were in the middle of the street, on islands, on sidewalks,
everybody calm, nobody panicking, all talking, people who had never
met before.
   ``You could smell smoke in the air, hear sirens from the police
cars, ambulances and fire trucks,'' he said. ``It was like a scene
out of a horror move or a war film. We were at ground zero, and we
survived.''

<TEXT>
   From the pursuit of democracy to
an unbending adherence to socialism, Communist countries are
responding in vastly different ways to the reforms of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The power shift in East Germany last week was another reminder
of the influence of reform movements rippling across the East bloc.
But the speed and the scope of change varies, depending on the
level of tolerance at the top.
   Poland is pursuing democracy and a free market economy with a
vigor borne of economic desperation. Romania, though also plagued
with terrible food shortages and skyrocketing inflation, is keeping
a tight grip on socialism.
   Czechoslovakia and Hungary are in somewhat better shape
economically, but Czechoslovakia jails pro-democracy dissenters
while Hungary says they can run for political office next year.
   Seemingly adrift in this unpredictable ideological sea is East
Germany, long considered a hard-line adherent to Communism but now
something of a question mark.
   Communist Party officials in East Germany acted to remove Erich
Honecker as leader only after mounting protests at home and a flood
of emigrants to the West deeply embarrassed the orthodox socialist
leadership.
   The new leader, 52-year-old Egon Krenz, has been considered a
hard-liner also, but he tried to give the impression of
conciliation during his first days in office. And on Saturday, he
was quoted as saying there may be ``important lessons'' to be
learned from Gorbachev's reforms.
   The man who gave strength to the Communist reform movement,
Gorbachev, continues to lead the Soviet Union down a rocky path of
greater openness and a less centralized economy.
   Gorbachev, who must deal with sniping from the right and the
left over his policies and a phalanx of ethnic disputes in the
Soviet republics, has said he will not interfere in what the rest
of the Warsaw Pact alliance is doing.
   Moscow, however, is expected to keep siding with East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries that hold the
party's ``leading role'' sacrosanct.
   In East Germany, the New Forum and other opposition groups used
Gorbachev's visit to the country earlier this month to press for
reform.
   ``If Gorbachev weren't there, the New Forum people would be sent
to the hinterlands or be sitting in prison,'' says East-West expert
Josef Janning of the University of Mainz.
   Western countries have made it clear they are willing to help
those countries undertaking political and economic reforms. The
U.S. House overwhelmingly approved $837 million in aid to Poland
and Hungary on Thursday, nearly double what the White House had
asked.
   ``Only the market place, only free enterprise, can solve the
desperate economic problems of the Eastern countries,'' U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher said in a speech in
Frankfurt last week.
   ``Marxist economics do not work.''
   Despite that assertion, there are likely to be problems ahead as
growing calls for capitalist-oriented free enterprise clash with
the cradle-to-grave socialism that now reigns in Eastern Europe.
   The changes have created much friction between hard-line and
progressive countries. Hungary infuriated Warsaw Pact ally East
Germany in September by opening its Western borders to East German
refugees.
   That was only one of several changes initiated by the
reform-minded leaders in Budapest, who also have promoted greater
free enterprise and promised free elections by June.
   ``This (free elections) characterizes all modern democratic
legal states,'' Interior Minister Istvan Horvath told Parliament on
Thursday.
   Although the leadership has disbanded the Communist Party in a
symbolic move, the top figures remain at the head of the newly
created Socialist Party.
   Poland is giddy over becoming the first East bloc country led by
non-Communists, but is facing the potential for more unrest as it
implements tough austerity measures.
   Communists, meanwhile, still control the foreign trade, defense,
interior and transportation ministries.
   Bulgaria has been paying lip service to reform and has
introduced limited economic changes, but is unlikely to change much
under 78-year-old leader Todor Zhivkov.
   In Czechoslovakia, the Communist government responded to a wave
of pro-democracy protests in January with carefully targeted
repression of key activists.
   That prompted Czechoslovak playwright and human rights activist
Vaclav Havel, who was jailed for four months this year, to speak of
``a country where one is still thrown in jail for his words'' and
where ``socialism has become a rubber truncheon.''
   In Romania, the East bloc reform movement irked Stalinist
President Nicolae Ceausescu so much that he suggested Warsaw Pact
intervention to block Solidarity's takeover in Poland.
   Ceausescu's iron-fisted, 24-year rule in Romania refuses to
budge, despite chronic shortages of food and fuel that leave
thousands literally shivering in their homes each winter.
   Yugoslavia, though not a member of the Soviet bloc, has been
grappling with serious ethnic clashes that until now have
overshadowed growing calls to banish the Communist Party's power
monopoly.
   Yugoslavs for decades have enjoyed the freedoms that many of
their Eastern European neighbors would cherish. The country faces
mounting economic troubles and an inflation rate of nearly 1,200
percent, while hundreds of thousands have gone to the West in
search of work.

<HEAD>Abortion Question Finally Comes to Vote in Pennsylvania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE McGRAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One Pennsylvania lawmaker received
gruesome pictures of aborted fetuses in the mail, while another was
accused of maintaining an unholy alliance with the pope.
   As the Legislature prepares to vote on a stringent package of
abortion restrictions this week, protesters have hung metal hangers
on the walls of legislators' district offices, conducted
candlelight vigils, picketed lawmakers when they spoke at almost
any kind of appearance, and sent mail by the truckload.
   When the vote is taken Tuesday, the traditionally anti-abortion
Legislature could become the first in the nation to adopt abortion
restrictions since the Supreme Court allowed states more latitude
in restricting abortions in July. An effort to pass new
restrictions fell short in the Florida legislature earlier this
month. Gov. Robert P. Casey has said he will sign the bill.
   Pro-choice lawmakers, who hold a minority in both the House and
Senate here, plan to fight the proposed restrictions and also will
try to loosen current regulations.
   The Missouri measures upheld by the Supreme Court ruling July 3
ban abortions in public hospitals, stop public employees from
counseling women about abortions, and require doctors performing
abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks old to determine if
it could live outside the womb.
   The anti-abortion legislation before the Pennsylvania
Legislature would ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy
except to save the life of the mother, prohibit abortions based on
a fetus' sex, require women to inform their husbands if they plan
to get an abortion, and require a 24-hour waiting period. The
legislation also would ban experiments done with the tissue of an
aborted fetus, except to save its life.
   Last year, Casey vetoed anti-abortion legislation, saying he
opposes abortion but didn't think it would survive a court
challenge. But in light of the Supreme Court decision, Casey said
he believed the current legislation would withstand a court fight.
   Rep. Stephen Freind, a suburban Philadelphia Republican and the
Legislature's chief abortion opponent, said he hopes to get his
proposed restrictions passed as an amendment to a bill now before
the House that would toughen penalties for incest. He said he
thought the measure could be passed more quickly that way, rather
than having the restrictions considered in a separate bill.
   Rep. Karen Ritter, a Democrat from the Lehigh Valley who leads
the House pro-choice caucus, said lobbying from both sides has been
intense.
   ``I got a postcard from a priest with a picture of a mutilated
fetus. It said, `I'm praying for your soul to come back to
Christ,''' she said.
   Anti-abortion supporters have vowed to bump her from the seat
she has held since 1987. Her father, James Ritter, held the same
seat from 165 to 1982 and received similar pressure, she said.
   Chris McNally, a freshman Democrat from Allegheny County, said
he is taking the 1,000 hangers taped to his office last week by
pro-choice advocates and using them in an impromptu clothing drive.
The hangers have become the symbol of the pro-choice movement
because they signify how some women were forced to abort their
fetuses before abortion became legal.
   ``I think it's great; people ought to lobby like this for every
issue. There's a lot of other issues that are very important and I
wish people would be more active on those,'' McNally said.
   An ardent opponent of abortion, Rep. Gerard Kosinski, said his
most memorable communication with pro-choice advocates was a letter
chastising him ``for taking orders from the Vatican.''
   ``As yet, I'm still awaiting a call from the pope,'' Kosinski
said.
   So far this fall, abortion opponents have made little headway in
state capitals or in Congress. In Austin, Texas, on Friday, Gov.
Bill Clements stunned anti-abortion leaders when he announced that
abortion restrictions will not appear on an agenda of an upcoming
special legislative session.
   Clements said the Nov. 14 special session will be limited to
workers' compensation reform.
   Clements' spokeswoman said she didn't think the governor was
swayed by recent events in Florida, where the Legislature rejected
in two days all abortion restrictions proposed by Gov. Bob Martinez.

   A Honduran Boeing 727 carrying 137
people smashed into a mountain region just south of Tegucigalpa
early today, officials said. At least 40 people were reported
killed.
   Radio HRN, a privately owned station, said 40 bodies had been
recovered from the site, about 25 miles south of the capital, and
another 20 injured had been rescued about four hours after the
crash.
   Earlier reports from the Tegucigalpa fire department indicated
that 60 people had been rescued. Red Cross and fire officials said
rescuers were still searching the wreckage.
   Those rescued all were hosptalized with serious burns,
firefighters and Red Cross workers said.
   The SAHSA airline passenger jet crashed at about 7:45 a.m. in
the mountain region of Las Tablitas, about 25 miles south of the
capital, said Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, the armed forces
chief.
   A SAHSA airline employee, who insisted on anonymity, said there
were 129 passengers and eight crew on board the plane when it
crashed. Earlier, airline officials had said there was a total of
143 people on board.
   Red Cross workers said a majority of the victims were suffering
from serious burn.
   Control tower employees at Tocontin Airport, who insisted on
anonymity, said unusually strong winds were blowing at the time the
aircraft was trying to land.
   Regalado Hernandez said he ordered military and civilian rescue
crews to the area as well as a number of air force helicopters.
Aviation routes in Honduras are controlled by the military.
   The plane was on a regular run from San Jose, the capital of
Costa Rica, to Tegucigalpa's Tocontin Airport with a stop in
Managua, the Nicaraguan capital.
   Nicaragua's Voice of Nicaragua said about 100 passengers, most
of them Nicaraguans, boarded the plane in Managua airport but gave
no details.
   Regalado Hernandez said that from reports he received he
believed the plane crashed at the foot of a mountain called Cerro
Hules. He said he had no further details.

<HEAD>Britain Rejects Sanctions In New South Africa Strategy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Saturday rejected as
``wrongheaded'' a Commonwealth strategy on South Africa seeking to
tighten financial pressures but said the organization now
acknowledges measures should not be punitive.
   ``It is a novel recognition that change is beginning (in South
Africa), that change is welcome and that ... we do not wish to hand
a broken-backed economy over to a new South Africa'' said British
Foreign Secretary John Major.
   He said there was a ``very welcome and new recognition'' at the
49-nation Commonwealth summit that sanctions may be relaxed ``as we
begin to see evidence that apartheid is being dismantled.''
   Britain also rejected outright three other key sections of a
draft declaration on South Africa.
   The draft was drawn up by a 10-nation foreign ministers'
committee after a day of argument. Diplomats called the exchanges
``robust.''
   Officials from Canada, which headed the committee, said that
with Britain refusing to budge from its lone opposition to
sanctions, ``we agreed to disagree.''
   Commonwealth leaders debated the South Africa draft during a
weekend retreat at Langkawi, a luxury resort island 210 miles
northwest of Kuala Lumpur.
   Malayasian officials said the final version would be issued
Sunday.
   At the retreat, some of the leaders played golf and Pakistan
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's 15-month-old son, Bilawal, joined
other leaders for lunch in his high chair.
   In a separate development, the summit issued a declaration on
the environment which, in a victory for developed nations, rejected
an Indian demand to set up a new environmental fund.
   The developed nations, including Britain, argued there was a
need for additional money but a new fund would be a wasteful
duplication of U.N. programs.
   Major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws on
South Africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers' committee
drawing up the communique on financial sanctions.
   ``We think they (the decisions) are both wrongheaded,'' Major
said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Diplomatic sources said the draft avoids setting any deadline
for reforms under threat of new sanctions.
   But the foreign ministers' committee, expanded to nine with the
inclusion of Malaysia, is to meet again in April to examine whether
South Africa's new president, F.W. de Klerk, has delivered on
promises of reform.
   Despite the deep differences, the draft appeared to mark a
modest shift toward consensus on South Africa _ an issue which has
long isolated Britain from its former colonies.
   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.
   The draft declaration encompasses a five-point Australian
proposal to organize international aid for a ``post-apartheid South
Africa,'' and says pressures should be eased if there is
``irreversible change,'' sources said.
   Apart from legalizing the African National Congress guerrilla
movement, that would mean de Klerk introducing legislation to
abolish fundamental race laws that deny South Africa's black
majority the vote.
   Britain complained here that the Commonwealth condemns South
Africa constantly while remaining silent of human rights violations
by black groups, including the South West African People's
organization in Namibia.

   African National Congress leaders
plan to address a rally in South Africa for the first time since
the organization was banned in 1960, activists said Saturday. The
government has granted permission.
   ``It's time for the ANC leaders to address the nation,'' said
Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the National Union of
Mineworkers.
   The seven ANC leaders freed from prison last Sunday will speak
at the rally Oct. 29 in the black township of Soweto outside
Johannesburg, the activists said.
   The activists belong to the National Reception Committee _ a
group of leaders and workers in major anti-apartheid organizations
set up to deal with release of the black leaders.
   ``Apart from being a welcoming party, the rally is going to be
an occasion at which our leaders will be making a major address to
the nation on a whole range of issues,'' said Ramaphosa.
   He said the government had been informed of plans for the rally
but no permission was sought. However, the Department of Justice
said in a statement late Friday that the chief magistrate of
Johannesburg had approved the rally.
   No African National Congress rally has been allowed in South
Africa since the organization was banned in 1960.
   Informed by reporters of the government action, Ramaphosa said,
``I am sure they knew that if they didn't allow it, we would have
taken them on.''
   He spoke at a news conference near the home of senior ANC leader
Walter Sisulu, where the black, green, and gold ANC flag _ legal
but seldom tolerated by police _ flew above the roof.
   Sisulu and some of the other freed prisoners met Saturday with
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu at an impromptu birthday
celebration for Sisulu's activist wife, Albertina, 72.
   ``Having Walter home is the best birthday present I could ever
have been given,'' said Mrs. Sisulu, who had been prohibited from
making public statements or attending public meetings since
February 1988.
   She said she intended to make her first address Sunday at a
rally in Johannesburg in support of the South-West African People's
Organization, fighting a pre-independence election in Namibia.
   Mrs. Sisulu's restrictions were lifted Oct. 13, but the
organization she heads, the United Democratic Front, is still
banned. She was re-elected this week as co-president of the front,
a coalition of anti-apartheid organizations, youth groups, and
township committees.
   Also Saturday, Sisulu and Tutu reacted negatively to a statement
by President F.W. de Klerk that before the government can consider
lifting the emergency and legalizing organizations, the groups must
promise that all violence will end.
   ``The more de Klerk allows our meetings to go ahead without
hindrance, the more he will understand that we are a peace-loving
people,'' said Sisulu. ``The organizations shall not give
guarantees as to the cessation of violence. It is the government
which must pave the way for peace.''
   Tutu cited the many peaceful marches that have occurred since de
Klerk took power in August. The only violence happened when police
stopped a march by women in Pretoria, and when some black youths
broke shop windows and looted at the end of a march in
Pietermaritzburg.

   Poland is pressing President Bush to
lead relief efforts for its new non-Communist government, but
Western leaders have made clear they see the matter as primarily
Europe's responsibility.
   Participants at last week's East-West security conference in
Frankfurt, called ``Security in the 1990s,'' indicated they will
continue to approach financial aid for reform-oriented East
European states as in the security interests of all Western nations.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government already has promised more
than $1 billion in debt relief to Poland, and projects to aid
Hungary in its move toward a multiparty democracy are also in the
works in advance of Kohl's visit to Budapest in December.
   The Group of Seven wealthy democracies decided at their summit
in Paris in July to coordinate aid to Poland and Hungary through
the European Economic Community based in Brussels, Belgium.
   Poland, however, would like to see Washington lead the effort.
   ``It's soon to become a question of whether we have a Marshall
Plan or martial law,'' said Dariusz K. Rosati, director of Warsaw's
Foreign Trade Research Institute.
   ``I say this to help visualize the dramatic choice facing the
Western side,'' he said in an interview.
   The Marshall Plan was a broad U.S.-financed aid program that
helped West Germany rebuild itself into an economic powerhouse
after the destruction of World War II.
   Some West German politicians have suggested a similar relief
effort be organized for Poland and Hungary to help rebuild
economies that have been ravaged by four decades of socialism.
   ``If there is no substantial improvement in the market situation
within a few months, no one _ not even the Mazowiecki government _
will be able to control what happens,'' Rosati said, referring to
the new leadership of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former
Solidarity journalist.
   Rosati said the Bush government should do the most ``because the
United States has always played a leading role in supporting change
in Poland.''
   But he acknowledged that European efforts have been swifter and
more comprehensive in organizing food aid and debt relief for
Poland.
   Bush has pledged $200 million in aid to Poland in conjunction
with a Western fund being set up to help the new Warsaw government.
   The U.S. House of Representatives substantially upped Bush's aid
offer with its approval Thursday of $837 million in support for
Hungary and Poland. But the package still awaits Senate approval,
and the White House has suggested the sum may be excessive.
   Kohl's chief foreign affairs adviser, Horst Teltschik, has said
the chancellor plans to guarantee during his visit to Warsaw in
mid-November that the aid pool will reach $1 billion _ effectively
promising whatever West German contribution is needed to reach that
level.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher told participants at
the security conference Thursday that Eastern Europe's economic
problems are ``home-grown'' and can be overcome only by
wide-ranging internal changes.
   ``Only the marketplace, only free enterprise, can solve the
desperate economic problems of the Eastern countries,'' Mosbacher
told the delegates in Frankfurt.
   Polish participants complained his views were short-sighted and
failed to address how Poland should get through the difficult
transition period.
   Rosati said inflation is spiraling and could soon overwhelm the
patience of Poles if they begin to see the turn toward democracy as
costing them food and economic stability.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher reiterated
Bonn's view that financial aid for reformist states like Poland and
Hungary is a crucial means of maintaining political and military
stability in Europe in a period of rapid change.

   Community leaders in this racially tense city are
bracing for the trial of a police officer in the shooting death of
a black motorcyclist that touched off riots in January.
   Acquittals of police officers in the deaths of blacks sparked
violence in Miami in 1980 and 1984. The impeachment conviction
Friday of a popular black federal judge, a heated local election
campaign and the drug war add kindling for catastrophe.
   Suspended Miami officer William E. Lozano is charged with
manslaughter in the Jan. 16 shooting of Clement Lloyd in a police
chase. After Lloyd was shot, his motorcycle crashed and passenger
Allan Blanchard was fatally injured.
   Jury selection begins Monday in Circuit Court unless Lozano's
attorneys succeed in getting the trial moved.
   The proceedings will be watched carefully by Miami's blacks, who
on Friday saw U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings removed by the
Senate for bribery conspiracy six years after his acquittal in a
jury trial. Black reaction was angry but peaceful, and an upbeat
Hastings announced he will run for governor.
   Nevertheless, community leaders say the removal of Florida's
first black U.S. district judge adds to tensions fueled by a
campaign in which a Cuban-American is seeking a city commission
seat traditionally held by a black.
   Perceptions of political and judicial inequality, combined with
persistent problems of crime and poverty in the inner-city
neighborhoods, may need only a spark to flash into violence again,
some community leaders say.
   ``If too many of those things break together and appear to be
going against the black community, I think there could be a
demonstration of concern and anger,'' said Arthur Teele, a black
lawyer. ``To quote Dr. Martin Luther King, dark and difficult days
lie ahead.''
   Mayor Xavier Suarez said he doesn't think ``a Dante's Inferno
scenario'' will occur, although he and other city officials are
preparing for the possibility of riots if Lozano is acquitted.
   Lozano, boosted by fund-raising efforts on Spanish-language
radio in Miami and in Colombia for his defense, expressed
confidence last week.
   ``I'm innocent. What I did, I did in self-defense, and we're
going to prove that in court,'' said Lozano, who is of Colombian
descent.
   Defense attorneys Roy Black and Mark Seiden helped Miami officer
Luis Alvarez gain acquittal in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a
black youth. That verdict began two days of violence.
   In 1980, the acquittal of five Metro-Dade officers in the
beating death of a black motorcyclist sparked three days of bloody
rioting that killed 18 people.
   Police Chief Perry Anderson, who is black and was raised in
Miami's inner city, said most blacks he hears talking about the
case just want to see a fair trial. But he stills expects an
acquittal to mean trouble, in part because efforts to ease the
despair and frustration underlying the recurrent racial violence
have infringed on the profitable turfs of crack dealers.
   ``I know for a fact that the drug dealers are preparing to try
to cause problems, a riot,'' Anderson said. ``They like to see the
police in a hostile situation, the community hostile against the
police.''
   Unlike the sudden January disturbances, in which one person died
and 22 stores were burned, police this time have had months to
prepare. All 1,100 officers will be on call at the end of the
trial, expected to last about three weeks.
   The city has ordered 700 gas masks and has two armored personnel
carriers and National Guard military equipment available.
   The city has a clear mandate from people in Overtown, Liberty
City and other predominantly black neighborhoods not to allow
looting, Suarez said.
   Anderson said police will make arrests immediately, unlike in
January when they formed a perimeter and refrained from mass
arrests until the third day of violence. The trouble occurred the
week before the city was host to the Super Bowl.
   Because the trouble broke out on Martin Luther King Day, police
were reluctant to charge into a community whose holiday had been
disrupted by a police killing, Anderson said.
   ``You've got to utilize force, but you've also got to use
sensitivity,'' he said.
   A review panel set up after the January riots called on police
to improve recruitment and promotion of blacks. Anderson said the
police force is 19 percent black, up from 17 percent, and moving
toward a goal of 21 percent to match the percentage of blacks in
the city population.

   Chris Hervey started her week with an
office to go to each morning and a house to return to each night.
Now, she has neither.
   But she has no time for pouting or pity. ``I'm here,'' the
earthquake survivor said proudly. ``I think people are just happy
they're alive. Then you assess your losses. You take what you've
got and you go on.''
   It's a philosophy shared by many residents of Santa Cruz County,
as they recover, rebuild and rebound from the catastrophic quake
that shook their communities last week.
   ``Start all over. It's what you have to do,'' said John Kane,
who narrowly escaped death Tuesday as he watched from the doorway
while a stream of bricks tumbled from the top of the building that
houses his insurance business.
   ``You can't roll over and die,'' he said, surveying his office
equipment spread out in the rubble-strewn parking lot in the back
of the office building that has been condemned.
   ``It's time for a rebirth,'' he said.
   But he knows it won't be easy. ``I'm preparing myself for a lot
of problems and a lot of trials and a lot of frustrations,'' he
said.
   Others will be in the same predicament in this county where five
people died, hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, and
thousands were left homeless. Some have ended up with the sky as a
roof, huddling in tents or sleeping bags in school grounds, parking
lots and back yards.
   Though some businesses have reopened and electricity has been
restored in many places, in towns such as Watsonville there still
are long lines for food, and mothers and their children walk the
streets carrying empty plastic jugs in search of water.
   Damage estimates already have reached the billion-dollar mark in
this county of 229,000 people. And the devastation is felt from the
rugged mountains near the epicenter of the quake where fissures
ripped open three-foot gashes in the earth, to the Pacific Garden
Mall in Santa Cruz where buildings split open like melons, to the
agricultural town of Watsonville, where a Victorian Gothic church
that survived the 1906 quake wasn't as lucky this time.
   For people in the county, this is only the latest assault by
nature. In recent years, there have been floods and fires _ and
fears of an earthquake.
   And if Tuesday's temblor wasn't bad enough, a series of
aftershocks frayed nerves and knocked down people trying to get
back on their feet.
   ``People say `I think I'm going to die,''' said crisis counselor
Rosa Zayas, who's been helping out at a 24-hour medical clinic in
Watsonville. ``People are sick, they're vomiting, they're confused.
They're not sure it's stopped.''
   Miss Hervey, for one, said the aftershocks were so big that when
her hands began trembling, ``you couldn't tell if it was nerves,
your pulse or the earthquake.''
   Her house has been condemned, and she said she has slept
outside, taking her 86-year-old grandmother with her. ``You sleep
in an area where nothing falls on you,'' she explained.
   Mary Oyervides said she, along with her husband and two
children, spent the last two nights in a car, then in a tent. Her
7-year-old daughter, she said, was with her the day of the quake
and witnessed flying bricks and trembling buildings. For a few days
after, she said, ``when something was not moving she would think it
was moving.''
   Now, she said, ``she just holds on to us.''
   Randy Graff, who works as a Red Cross volunteer at a Santa Cruz
shelter, said he also notices lingering fears. ``When there was an
aftershock (Thursday), I watched people get off their cots and
start running,'' he said. ``People are cracking under the
pressure.''
   But others are coping with their losses by getting involved.
Doctors and nurses have offered their services at the free
Watsonville clinic. Scores of volunteers have showed up to help the
Red Cross at shelters.
   One is Ken Biby, who lost his mobile home and many of his
belongings in the quake.
   ``I've been keeping myself busy,'' he said. ``As long as I'm
doing this, I ain't got all of that on my mind.''
   He said he and his family are planning to move next week to
Alaska. Originally, he had planned to wait until next summer, but
he said, ``This was the extra push I needed.''
   Biby is pragmatic about his plight.
   ``If I had lost a kid, I probably would have gone crazy,'' he
said. ``I face reality. Material things can be replaced. Humans
can't. I got my truck, I got my wife and my kids. That's enough.''
   And for those who are staying in Santa Cruz County, there's a
combination of resiliency and an acceptance of nature's quirks.
``You can take your choice,'' Miss Hervey said. ``There's stuff all
over the world that can scare your shorts off.''
   Red Cross volunteer Graff said he also is staying and expects
others will too. ``People here,'' he said, ``are trying to gather
their things, their thoughts, fix themselves up and dust themselves
off and be ready for the next one.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Replaces Civil Servants with Political Appointees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDS: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, Thornburgh had ..., to CORRECT `nine months'
to nine years. ^By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine months after Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh ousted five career civil servants from the Justice
Department's public affairs staff, he has hired two political
appointees to help answer reporters' queries.
   Michael Robinson, who helps edit the daily news summary for
President Bush, and Amy J. Casner, an aide to Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, will soon join the department,
chief spokesman David Runkel said Friday.
   Thornburgh had cited budgetary constraints nine months ago when
he laid off the five career spokesmen with many years in their
jobs. The latest appointments bring to three the number of new
public affairs officers hired since the office was scaled back.
   Last spring, Thornburgh appointed Daniel Eramian, who had been a
Republican Party spokesman in the Massachusetts legislature, to be
deputy public affairs director.
   Runkel denied that the hirings are part of a plan to replace
career employees with Republican Party loyalists. But since the
layoffs earlier this year, Joseph C. Krovisky has been the only
civil servant working as a Justice Department spokesman.
   ``The intention of the the January RIFS (reductions in force),
an action which has been upheld by the Office of Personnel
Management, was to bring the department's public affairs office
within the budget set for it by the Congress,'' Runkel said.
   ``There is nothing being done which in any way would run counter
to the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) personnel and
budgetary provisions for the public affairs office,'' Runkel said.
   ``This does not signal any increase in the personnel level or
the budget,'' Runkel said. He declined to say whether that meant
someone currently on the staff would be leaving.
   Runkel, who heads the office of Public Affairs, was Thornburgh's
press secretary when the attorney general was governor of
Pennsylvania.
   Casner, who has worked in advertising as well as the Bush-Quayle
campaign press office last year, will be paid $28,800 a year.
   Robinson, who has worked for the Syracuse Post-Standard, the
Chicago Sun-Times and The New York Times, will be paid $26,200,
Runkel said.
   ``I think you will find these are bright, energetic people who
will assist our public affairs office,'' he said.
   Thornburgh has had rocky relations with the Justice Department
press corps in recent months.
   He has been outspoken about stopping news leaks of details of
ongoing criminal investigations, saying that Justice Department
attorneys should not talk to reporters.
   He has ordered several leak investigations, notably an extensive
probe into disclosures that the FBI was investigating alleged
financial irregularities in the office of Rep. William Gray III,
D-Pa.
   That leak proved particularly embarrassing for Thornburgh
because it came as Gray was running for House majority whip.
   Accusations from Democrats that the Justice Department was
engaged in political leaks prompted one of Thornburgh's top aides
to state that Gray was not a target of the investigation.
   The Justice Department considered subpoenaing the telephone
records of Rita Braver, the CBS correspondent who first reported
the Gray story. But leak investigators dropped the effort after
determining the telephone company doesn't log local calls.
   Since then, the Justice Department's criminal division adopted a
new policy allowing for the prosecution of officials for theft of
government property if they leak non-classified information about
criminal investigations.
   Previous department policy dating back to 1978 had barred the
use of the statute to prosecute leakers. Conviction of the theft
charge carries a 10-year prison term.

   Palestinians in the occupied territories held a
general strike Saturday to press demands for independence and
clashed with Israeli troops, leaving at least 11 Arabs wounded,
Arab reports said.
   The army said two Palestinian youths died overnight of wounds
suffered in earlier clashes. The deaths raised to 598 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
uprising. Forty Israelis have died.
   Traffic throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip came to
a halt and shops and businesses were closed following strike calls
from the underground leadership of the 22-month-old Palestinian
revolt.
   The uprising leaders said in a leaflet that Saturday's strike
was meant to show rejection of Israel's peace plan and to press
demands for an independent Palestinian state.
   Israel's plan calls for elections in the occupied territories to
choose Palestinian representatives for negotiations on a limited
autonomy.
   The PLO has rejected the proposal.
   Demonstrations erupted Saturday in Nablus, the largest town in
the West Bank, and the neighboring Balata refugee camp. Arab
hospital officials in Nablus said they treated five people shot by
Israeli troops.
   Scattered clashes were also reported in the occupied Gaza Strip,
and hospital officials said they treated six wounded. The military
command said it was checking the reports.
   At least 132 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on
suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   The army command said a 17-year-old youth from Khan Yunis died
at an Israeli hospital late Friday. It said the youth, identified
by Arab reporters as Iyad El-Asi, was shot by troops Friday when he
tried to grab a rifle from a soldier.
   At the Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel, 18-year-old Nidal Hajaij
of Gaza City died of a head wound suffered in a clash with soldiers
earlier this month, the army said.

   Rescuers today pulled a man alive from the
wreckage of a collapsed freeway in Oakland, and after spending 89
hours buried in the rubble of Northern California's major
earthquake he was able to wave his arms, authorities said.
   ``He has been removed and is in transit to Highland Hospital,''
five miles from the scene, said Tom Silvey, a spokesman for the
state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento.
   Silvey said the man was tentatively identified as Buck Helms,
57, hometown not immediately known. He was alone in a Chevrolet
Sprint automobile.
   Helms had a steady pulse and was apparently in stable condition,
Silvey said.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson was at the scene when the man was
rescued and saw the man wave his arms.
   ``When he came out, it was just an incredible and a wonderful
sight to see after he had been there some 89 hours,'' the mayor
said.
   Rescue operations had been suspended Friday night because the
1\-mile stretch of Interstate 880 became too unstable. But at 6
a.m., a transportation engineer reported seeing movement in a
heavily damaged section, and an all-out effort started.
   Five fours later, officials said the man was alive.
   Workers pushed dirt under the roadbed to stabilize it and
drilled holes in the concrete to reach the victim.
   ``It is a very, very dangerous effort,'' said California Highway
Patrol spokesman Mike Garver.
   Rain, winds and colder temperatures that began moving in today
were expected to fill shelters for the homeless this weekend, slow
recovery work and possibly even touch off further landslides across
earthquake-shaken Northern California.
   ``Right now, we're gearing up for a large influx of people,''
said Matt McLaughlin, a relief coordinator in Santa Cruz County
south of here, where an estimated 10,000 residents have been
displaced and some have been sleeping outside.
   At the fallen stretch of double-deck Interstate 880 in Oakland,
   The massive dig to recover bodies from the fallen stretch of
double-deck highway in Oakland was suspended Friday night after
workers felt the roadway shake. High winds were a contributing
factor, a spokesman said.
   Telephone-pole-sized timbers were trucked in to help prop up
precariously perched chunks of roadway, and dirt was heaped
underneath for support.
   Coordinators said work would continue today _ unless nature
inflicts further hardship on the area.
   ``It depends on how hard the rain is. If it's not too hard we
hope to be able to work through it,'' said Bob Jacobs, deputy
district director of California Department of Transportation.
   The National Weather Service said ``splatterings'' of light rain
showers are moving through the Bay area this morning, and will
continue through the night. A second system Sunday will bring
heavier rain, forecaster Daryl Williams said.
   On Friday, state officials raised the estimate of damage from
Tuesday's killer quake to $5.5 billion, and coroners reported 55
bodies had been recovered as workers dug more than a dozen victims
from under tons of freeway concrete in Oakland.
   So far, 34 bodies have been uncovered in the freeway rubble.
Oakland police said some 85 people are listed as missing.
   Building supply stores rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood,
cement, flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shield
from the rain.
   Rain also raised the threat of additional landslides in the
mountains north of Santa Cruz, where 60 homes already have been
destroyed in Boulder Creek, a town of 6,800.
   ``It's a dangerous area, but all my stuff is here. My dogs are
here. I figured you go down with the ship. Where do you go?'' said
Todd Viele, 27, who decided to stay.
   County spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said not enough rain was
expected to cause widespread land problems.
   ``There probably will be some additional landslides, but where
you really get some serious land and mudslides is where the earth
has been saturated, and we've been having a drought,'' said Ms.
Phillips.
   National Weather Service forecaster Doug Atkinson said the storm
would probably produce only one-quarter inch of rain.
   More than 1,500 aftershocks have hit since Tuesday.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale struck
near Santa Cruz at 5:50 p.m. PDT, according to the Seismograph
Station at the University of California at Berkeley. There were no
immediate reports of damage.
   At 1:13 a.m. Friday, an aftershock of magnitude 3.9 was centered
about seven miles southwest of Los Gatos, Berkeley seismologists
said. It caused additional landslides in that shaky area south of
San Francisco, and was felt north and south of the city.
   The reality of the grim task of uncovering bodies at the I-880
disaster appeared to be taking a toll on workers Friday, even as
President Bush arrived for a tour.
   ``You see a car that's crushed, a lot of debris, you usually
find the people slumped over the steering wheel,'' said Alameda
firefighter Matt Tunney, who was part of the rescue operation.
   ``I'd thought I'd seen everything. This is devastation, the
worst disaster I've ever seen,'' he said.
   Bush also was struck by what he saw as he toured ravaged areas
to offer sympathy, aid and a pledge of no bureaucratic red-tape.
   ``I am deeply moved by this, saddened in some ways, yet very
stimulated by this team effort,'' the president said.
   Bush walked over chunks of concrete beside the 1\-mile crumpled
stretch of I-880, where scores of people were feared entombed, and
talked with rescue workers. He had said he hoped to offer
encouragement.
   Ironworker Joe Carter said the president asked him how his
rescue crew felt.
   ``I told him ... we're beat, we're tired, but we're still going
at it,'' Carter said. Bush ``let me know the eyes of the world are
on us right now.''
   Relief aid continued to stream into the area Friday. But the
most urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homeless
families from sheltersto temporary living quarters such as hotels,
a Red Cross official said.
   About 5,000 people have been housed in 30 shelters in the region
affected by Tuesday's quake, the Red Cross said.
   Members of the San Francisco Giants, participants in baseball's
suspended World Series, visited a downtown shelter Friday to hand
out souvenir balls, caps and T-shirts to families left homeless by
the quake.
   Scientists roaming through mountains southeast of San Francisco
pinpointed the epicenter of Tuesday's 5:04 p.m. killer quake in the
northeast corner of the Nisene Marks State Park, near the top of
Aptos Creek, said Joseph Cotton with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park.
   That's about 57 miles from San Francisco atop the San Andreas
Fault, and just 14 miles northeast Santa Cruz.
   The scientists converged on the Santa Cruz Mountains to look for
the origins of the earthquake. Geologists were investigating
whether a fissure hundreds of yards long and as wide as 20 inches
in some spots was in fact the result of the San Andreas Fault
rupturing to the surface.
   Estimates for reopening the main lifeline between San Francisco
and Oakland, the Bay Bridge, slipped to at least a month.
   Engineers hoped to use a floating crane to lift the fallen
200-ton, 50-foot-long five-lane highway span onto a barge this
weekend and begin repairs, the transportation department said.
   At Stanford University near Palo Alto, 24 building were closed
indefinitely, and university President Donald Kennedy said the
destruction ``certainly is going to add up in the many tens of
millions of dollars.''
   Housing for 500 students was damaged, and professors have been
asked to postpone tests.
   In San Francisco's Marina district, an upscale neighborhood
where lifestyles crumbled along with stucco condominiums and posh
apartments, residents stuffed clothes, artwork, furniture and
knickknacks into cars, toy wagons and even laundry bags.
   The neighborhood was the worst hit in the city because its homes
were built on landfill, not bedrock. As many as 60 homes either
collapsed or will be torn down.

   A couple that claims their daughter was
switched with another girl in a hospital maternity ward promised
not to seek custody in exchange for an agreement on genetic testing
to settle the dispute.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg returned from Pennsylvania to Sebring
earlier this month to be closer to the 10-year-old Sarasota girl
they claim is their daughter, Kimberly Michelle Mays.
   The child's father, Robert Mays, agreed Friday to the genetic
testing only after the Twiggs promised not to seek custody of
Kimberly if she proves to be their biological daughter. They will
retain the option to seek visitation rights.
   ``I don't know why it took so long to get to this point,'' Mays
said. ``If Mr. and Mrs. Twigg and I had sat down a year ago, we
could have accomplished the same thing.''
   Regina Twigg said her family was relieved and her seven other
children were ecstatic that they might soon meet their missing
sister.
   ``For once and for all we will find out if she is or is not a
Twigg,'' said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney.
   Mays, who has long resisted testing for fear he would traumatize
or even lose his daughter, agreed for himself and his daughter to
give blood samples within 10 days to be tested at either Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore or the University of Florida in
Gainesville. Mays' first wife died in 1981.
   Under the agreement, which still must be approved by a Sarasota
Circuit judge, the Twiggs could seek visitation rights if they are
determined to be the biological parents. Each party would select a
psychologist to interview everyone involved and make a
recommendation within two months about how much contact should be
maintained.
   The Twiggs began their fight after learning through genetic
tests that the girl they raised, Arlena, was not biologically
theirs. Arlena died of a heart defect in 1988, never knowing that
questions had been raised about who her parents were.
   The Twiggs have sued Hardee Memorial Hospital in U.S. District
Court in Tampa, claiming employees at the Wauchula hospital
switched their child shortly after birth with another newborn. The
only other white girl born there about the same time was Kimberly
Mays.
   As early as February, the Twiggs said they would forgo custody
of Kimberly _ even if she turned out to be their real child _ if
they could spend time with her.
   Mays has maintained since the Twiggs' first raised the question
of Kimberly's parentage that he would do what was in the best
interest of his daughter, short of giving her up to the Twiggs.

   Lebanese Christian lawmakers agreed to
a new power-sharing arrangement with rival Moslems, and Syria
agreed to relocate some of its troops in Beirut, sources at a
Lebanese parliament conference said Saturday.
   The breakthroughs were disclosed one day before the final
scheduled session of the fractured Lebanese parliament in Taif,
where Moslem and Christian lawmakers have been meeting in an effort
to settle their 14-year-old civil war.
   The lawmakers would next meet in Lebanon to formerly implement
any plan reached Sunday.
   One source close to the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``differences of opinion'' surfaced in the
Christian camp during a meeting Saturday afternoon.
   Conference sources said that before debate began on the thorny
issue of the Syrian military presence, the Christians accepted a
proposal to expand the 99-seat Parliament by 29 members to allow
Moslems equal legislative powers.
   That was one of the key points of political reform suggested in
a four-chapter peace plan drafted by an Arab League committee to
settle the war.
   Sixty-three of Parliament's 73 surviving members have been
studying the draft peace accord since Sept. 30.
   A second session of the Christian legislators was set for 11
p.m. and was expected to continue well into the night, the sources
said.
   They said the Christian deputies would confer by telephone with
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and militia chieftain Samir Geagea
in Beirut, and with Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir at
the Vatican.
   Although the 33 Christians and 30 Moslems meeting in Taif
clashed on a number of issues in the original draft, the problem
that nearly collapsed the talks was the chapter on Syrian troops.
   The original draft suggested a gradual withdrawal from Beirut
into east Lebanon's Bekaa valley in two years, without committing
Damascus to a total evacuation from the country after that.
   Christians insisted on a fixed timetable for a quick withdrawal
from all of Lebanon, and Moslems argued that the Syrian presence is
their only guarantee for implementation of political reforms.
   Moslems, who make up 55 percent of the 4 million population,
want an equal share of power with the Christians, who have
dominated the government, Parliament, army and judiciary since
independence from France in 1943.
   The compromise, worked out by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal during a two-day visit to Damascus this week, was not
disclosed.
   But sources said Damascus agreed to it.
   They said it fell short of the Christians' demand for a
withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon in less than three
years.
   They said Syria agreed that its troops pull out of a
.6-mile-radius ``security zone'' around the Parliament before the
chamber meets in formal sessions to ratify political changes and
elect a new president.
   The Syrians would be replaced by Lebanese police backed by
Algerian and Moroccan observers, the sources said.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, 1988,
when President Amin Gemayel's term ended with Parliament unable to
meet to elect a successor.
   Whether Syria accepted the Christian demand that the Syrian
presence in the Bekaa does not exceed one year remained unclear.
   Conference sources said Syria refused a specific timetable for
the Bekaa withdrawal, instead proposing it be worked out by a joint
Syrian-Lebanese military committee after political reforms are
ratified, a president is elected and a unified government is formed.
   Conference sources said there were minor changes in legalistic
terms in the formulation of the draft that the Christians sought.
   The sources quoted Faisal as telling the Christian deputies that
the concessions he got from Damascus were the ``maximum'' Syria was
prepared to agree to.
   The sources said that as a guarantee to the Christians, Faisal
suggested the 22-member Arab League, which gave the
Saudi-Moroccan-Algerian committee six months from May to find a
settlement in Lebanon, extend this mandate to two years to oversee
full implementation of the accord.

   Millions of dollars worth of fruits and
vegetables were destroyed in the Northern California earthquake,
with much of it crushed in warehouse collapses or spoiled in
frozen-food processing plants brought to a halt.
   And agricultural workers, many of them living in substandard
houses knocked down by the quake, have scattered or are too busy
finding housing to return to the fields or help clean up, officials
said.
   Cans and drums filled with 400,000 tons of the San Francisco Bay
area summer tomato harvest came tumbling down in many of the 14
corrugated steel wall warehouses of Hollister. An ammonia leak at
the Green Giant frozen food plant in Watsonville could result in
$20 million worth of losses in frozen Brussels sprouts, broccoli
and other vegetables.
   ``The loss will be in the millions,'' said Steve Arnoldy,
director of operations for San Benito Foods, which owns six of the
Hollister tomato warehouses. ``Some of our buildings we can't even
get into. It's a miracle there was no one in the warehouses.''
   Crops in the field were only slightly affected by irrigation
pumps temporarily stopped because of electrical power outages in
the earthquake on Tuesday.
   Del Mar Foods in Watsonville, a medium-sized food processor,
resumed operation Thursday when electrical power was restored, said
Del Mar President P.J. Mecozzi.
   Cool weather kept unprocessed food from spoiling, but a lack of
returning workers has delayed cleanup of about $1 million worth of
goods that fell from warehouse pallets during the quake.
   ``We've had a hard time getting our crews back to work because
they have been displaced from their homes,'' Mecozzi said.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate in Soviet Kazakhstan Against Nuclear Testing</HEAD>

   Thousands of people rallied in Kazakhstan on
Saturday to protest nuclear testing in the Central Asian republic,
Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency said protesters gathered in the capital
of the republic, Alma-Ata, to call for an end to testing in the
Semipalatinsk area of Kazakhstan and a halt to testing by the
United States in Nevada.
   Protesters in Semipalatinsk itself and other towns in Kazakhstan
also held protests, it said. Tass gave no specific figure for the
number of people at the rallies.
   Tass said the protests were organized by a Soviet anti-nuclear
group called ``Nevada-Semipalatinsk,'' the most prominent
grassroots anti-nuclear group in the Soviet Union.
   Infant mortality in the Semipalatinsk region is among the
highest in the country and the cancer rate there has been climbing
sharply for 15 years, a prominent Kazakhstan health official told
the crowd in the city of Alma Ata.
   The protesters appealed for the Soviet Union's legislature to
put the ``immediate closing of the Semipalatinsk'' testing site on
its agenda, Tass said.
   On Friday, about 150 students from Kazakhstan converged on the
Defense Ministry's General Staff building in Moscow to call for an
end to the underground tests in their homeland.
   A nuclear device was exploded Thursday with a yield of 20 to 75
kilotons, Tass reported.

   After years of resistance to change, East
Germany's Communist leadership conceded Saturday there may be
``important lessons'' to be learned from reforms introduced by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Thousands of pro-democracy activists rallied in East Berlin and
Plauen to keep up the pressure for change. East Berlin's top two
officials had a heated confrontation with a crowd that briefly
surrounded them.
   The official ADN news agency said East Germany's new Communist
Party chief, Egon Krenz, spoke by telephone with Gorbachev about
his reforms, which have given non-communists seats in the Soviet
government and allowed more open discussion of the nation's
problems.
   After years of contending Gorbachev's reforms were unnecessary
in East Germany, ADN said Krenz acknowledged ``there are important
lessons to be learned from Soviet perestroika in the German
Democratic Republic.'' Perestroika refers to Gorbachev's reforms.
   Gorbachev invited Krenz to visit Moscow, and the trip will take
place soon, ADN said without giving a date.
   About 2,000 East Germans marched through central East Berlin
linked arm-in-arm, demanding ``Democracy now'' and the release of
political prisoners and jailed protesters.
   Lutheran Church sources also reported that at least 30,000
demonstrated in the city of Plauen, chanting ``democracy'' and
``Neues Forum,'' the German name of a new opposition group.
   After the East Berlin march, East Berlin Communist Party leader
Guenter Schabowsky and Mayor Erhard Krack were surrounded by more
than 100 marchers demanding to know if the government is serious
about reform, witnesses said.
   It was not immediately clear how Schabowsky and Krack came to be
on the streets with the demonstrators.
   ``After 40 years, now you come to us and want to talk,''
exclaimed one citizen. ``What are you really going to do to change
things?''
   A young East Berliner declared: ``When you trust us enough to
let us buy a ticket to Munich or Rome, then you'll start being
taken seriously.''
   Travel restrictions are among the most frequently aired
complaints about East Germany.
   On the main evening newscast, Aktuelle Kamera, Schabowsky was
shown telling citizens: ``We are going to have to live with the
fact that, for a long time, people are going to think that what we
are doing is a trap. But it is not.''
   The encounter involving Schabowsky and Krack was likely intended
to gauge public sentiment on the hesistant moves toward change
taken since Wednesday, when Krenz was named party leader.
   In another unusually frank report by the government news agency,
ADN said at least 20,000 East Germans staged a pro-reform
candlelight vigil in the city of Dresden late Friday. It also
reported that the deputy police chief in East erlin promised to
investigate allegations of police brutality during pro-democracy
demonstrations earlier this month.
   The police official, Dieter Dietze, was quoted as saying 60
complaints filed in connection with those marches would be
``thoroughly investigated.''
   Police used force to break up pro-democracy protests that swept
the nation before and during its Oct. 7 celebration of 40 years of
statehood. Larger demonstrations since then have been allowed to
take place peacefully.
   Krenz replaced Erich Honecker as Communist Party leader when the
77-year-old Honecker stepped down after 18 years in power.
   Honecker cited health reaons, but widespread dissatisfaction
with his authoritarian government, which has led about 55,000 East
Germans to flee West in recent weeks, had increased pressure for a
change.
   The Krenz leadership responded to public calls for more
democracy with a promised dialogue on ways to improve East German
living standards. But Krenz made clear in a speech the night of his
appointment that communists have no plan to share power with
fledgling opposition groups or embrace reforms as broad as those
under way in Poland and Hungary.
   Since Krenz took over, the state-run media have embarked on
unprecedented discourses advocating change.
   ``The gate to dialogue over reforms in our nation has been flung
open,'' the Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported
Saturday.
   ``We have to be very clear about which concrete form of
democracy we want,'' it said.
   Another Communist Party newspaper, Neues Deutschland, devoted a
lengthy commentary to the nation's problems, focusing on Krenz's
proposal to draft a new law making it easier for East Germans to
travel outside the country.
   ``We don't want to leave our German Democratic Republic,'' the
newspaper wrote. ``We want to help change things for the better.
But we would like, every now and then, to see Vienna, or Paris, or
Munich or Stockholm, and come home with new and interesting
impressions.''
   Western diplomatic sources in East Berlin said they were
expecting another meeting of the policy-setting party Central
Committee later this week to consider some reform proposals and
replacements for party officials fired last week in the shake-up
that ousted Honecker.

   David Eisenhower, grandson and biographer
of the late President Dwight Eisenhower, said Saturday the town's
celebration of his grandfather's 100th birthday will fulfill a
boyhood dream.
   ``My granddad lived many places in his life, there's 37 in
all,'' Eisenhower said. ``But he chose to come to Gettysburg.''
   ``It's the place where I knew him best,'' Eisenhower said.
``It's the place where he was the most vivid person that I knew. It
was the place where he felt natural and at home.''
   The 41-year-old historian spoke at a news conference at
Gettysburg College announcing a yearlong celebration commemorating
the Oct. 14, 1890, birth of the nation's 34th president.
   Eisenhower, of Valley Forge, has been working on three-volume
history of grandfather since 1976. The first volume, ``Eisenhower:
At War, 1943-1945,'' was released earlier.
   President Eisenhower worked at the college after he left office,
was a trustee of the college and lived on a farm that remains a
tourist attraction outside of town. He died in 1969.
   Saturday's ceremonies were part of several activities
coordinated by the Eisenhower Society, a local group formed to
honor the late president and World War II general.

   Former tennis superstar Bjorn Borg said
allegations by his ex-girlfriend that he used cocaine during their
relationship were ``shameless,'' a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Borg, 33, filed a lawsuit in a Stockholm District Court last
week against the Swedish monthly magazine ``Z,'' which published
allegations by Jannike Bjorling, Borg's former girlfriend.
   ``Her allegations are false and shameless,'' Borg said in a
story in Expressen, Scandinavia's largest evening newspaper. ``If
you want more information, please read the lawsuit and attend the
court proceedings.''
   When asked if he ever used cocaine, Borg said, ``You've got all
the answers and facts in the lawsuit. It's as simple as that.''
   It's the first time Borg, interviewed in Tokyo, has commented on
Bjorling's allegations. They met more than five years ago, and had
a son, Robin, the following year. The couple is involved in a
custody battle for the child.
   Borg, who won an unprecedented five consecutive Wimbledon titles
from 1976 to 1980 as well as six French Open crowns, amassed an
estimated personal fortune of about $105 million. He retired in
1983.

   Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen was
awarded an honorary doctorate at Hendrix College, a school she left
17 years ago to pursue her dream of acting.
   The Arkansas native told a crowd of about 350 people on Friday
that she accepted the doctorate of human letters not as a star, but
as ``a fellow student in life who will continue to dream.''
   ``I thank Hendrix for the ability to examine the dream,'' she
said. ``The important thing is that I had a place where I could be
brave and take risks.''
   She spoke about living life to the fullest, using the Latin
``carpe diem,'' which translates ``seize the day.''
   ``I sometimes fail miserably, but I try to seize the day,'' she
said.
   Born in Newport and raised in North Little Rock, Steenburgen,
36, lived in New York and Los Angeles for five years after leaving
Hendrix in 1972 before being discovered by actor Jack Nicholson.
She then won her first starring role in the movie ``Going South.''
   She won her Academy Award for best supporting actress in 1980
for her role in ``Melvin and Howard.''

   Scottish golfing star Sandy Lyle has
married his Dutch sweetheart in nearby Gibraltar, the bride's
mother said Saturday.
   Jolande Huurman, 26, and Lyle were wed Friday in a private
ceremony at the Registry Office at the nearby British colony on
Spain's southern tip, said the bride's mother, Evelien Schelt.
   ``They're both happy and hopeful,'' Schelt said by telephone.
   She said the couple remained in southern Spain and had postponed
their honeymoon until after Lyle competes in the Volvo Masters
tournament in nearby Sotogrande, Cadiz province, which starts
Thursday.
   That tournament is the PGA European Tour season finale.
   The new Mrs. Lyle is a physical therapist. The golf star met her
when she worked as a masseuse on the PGA European Tour in 1986-87,
Schelt said.
   Lyle's greatest triumphs include the 1988 U.S. Masters, the 1985
British Open and the 1987 U.S. Tournament Players Championship. But
he has not won a tournament this year.
   Schelt said Friday's wedding in Gibraltar and a later private
party at her house in Estepona were attended only by the couple's
parents and Lyle's two children from a previous marriage.

   Writer William Wharton, who has guarded his
privacy for years, is making a public plea to stop a farming
practice that led to the death of his daughter and her family.
   Wharton's first-born daughter, Kate Rodewald, and her husband,
Bill Rodewald, both 36, and their two children were killed last
year when a farmer's field-clearing fire ran out of control and
sent thick smoke across Interstate 5 near Albany, leading to a
chain-reaction traffic accident.
   ``The only thing to do that I can see is to make it so it
doesn't happen to somebody else,'' said Wharton, 63. ``I don't want
anyone to suffer as we have suffered, ever, for the rest of my
life. I'll make a difference if it kills me. ``Now I'm coming out
of the closet,'' Wharton said. ``I'm sacrificing my privacy.''
   His daughter and her family were among seven people killed and
35 injured during the accident Aug. 2, 1988.
   Over the past year, Wharton says he has written numerous letters
trying to elicit answers and apologies from Oregon officials,
including Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   He is on a nationwide tour to mark the release of his new book,
``Franky Furbo,'' published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. He is also the
author of ``Birdy,'' ``Dad,'' ``A Midnight Clear,'' ``Scumbler,''
``Tidings'' and ``Pride.''

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Man Convicted Of Attempted Murder For Biting Police
Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man infected with the AIDS virus was
convicted of attempted murder for biting a police officer and
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Gregory Scott Scroggins, 27, of Smyrna was found guilty late
Friday night after three hours of deliberations by a Cobb County
Superior Court jury.
   Judge Watson White sentenced him to 10 years in prison, which
defense attorney Greg Schroeder said was ``tantamount to a death
sentence.''
   Scroggins bit Cobb County Police Officer David Crook as the
officer was investigating a dispute between Scroggins and his
roommate, Paul Murray, on Jan. 29.
   Scroggins testified that he did bite the officer, ``but I would
never intentionally inflict this terrible disease on anyone.'' He
said he bit because the officer had him in a choke hold, and he
could not breathe.
   Schroeder said he would appeal Scroggins' conviction. ``This
decision sends the message that anyone testing HIV (AIDS virus)
positive and involved in a crime can expect to be charged with
murder,'' he said.
   Scroggins tested positive for the AIDS virus last December,
according to trial testimony. The police officer said he has tested
negative for the virus in two AIDS tests.
   Emory University medical school professor David Rimland said
there have been no confirmed cases of the virus being transmitted
through saliva, although ``the possibility exists, at least in
theory.''
   Murray was convicted of obstructing a police officer, as were
Scroggins' parents, Philip and Angie Scroggins. They were accused
of assaulting Crook while he tried to arrest their son and were
sentenced to a year's probation and a $250 fine.
   Officials said it was the first case of its kind in Georgia.
   ``They say there's no documented cases,'' Crook said, ``but I
would hate to be the first.''
   Prosecutors in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1986 charged an
AIDS-infected man with attempted murder for biting a jail guard,
but the jury in that case acquitted the man.
   In Alabama, a state appeals court overturned a first-degree
assault conviction this summer of an AIDS-infected inmate who bit a
prison guard, but said there was enough evidence to support a
lesser assault charge.
   In St. Louis, an inmate who bit two guards after testing
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus was properly convicted of
assault with a deadly weapon because human bites are inherently
dangerous, a federal appeals court ruled in May.

   I had just got home to watch the pregame and the World Series.
I'm lying there on the bed, all comfortable, and I have my munchies
and everything all set for the game. And suddenly it started
shaking, which I'm used to. They're sort of like an adventure,
usually, but this was a real adventure.
   Usually it will shake a little bit, and then it stops. But this
one just kept getting bigger and bigger and the wall across the
room is coming toward me, away from me, toward me, away from me,
rocking back and forth.
   And when the first plaster came down, I just thought, ``I'm
getting under the bed,'' but it was rocking so hard I couldn't even
get off the bed. ... And then the ceiling came down. ...
   ``The first heavy thing that came down was (from) the guy who
lived above me. His dresser came right through the ceiling and
landed on my cat. ... When I saw that I thought, ``Well, this is
it.''
   I just barely had time to look up and the whole ceiling came
down. ... The whole thing came down in one piece. If I had been on
the floor, a solid surface, I don't think I would have made it. But
I was on the soft bed, so I sort of sank onto the bed. ... I was
kind of crushed. ... I injured my back.
   After about an hour, I broke through the plaster that was
against my face to give me some maneuvering room ... and I pushed
down on the mattress and once I got down to the side of the bed I
had a crawl space. ...
   I didn't realize I was a whole floor lower than where I started.
... (The building) had just pancaked.

   I had just woken up and everything started to shake. I thought
they were tearing down our building, because it's a condemned
building that we sleep in. ... I was thinking, ``I gotta get out.''
   I crawled out and was looking around to see where the wrecking
ball was ... and realized it was an earthquake. ... I didn't think
it was that bad.
   Inside the house, it felt just like it was built out of cards.
It was going that way and that way. ...
   If I was thinking anything, it was ``Get out.'' ... Most of the
thinking I did afterward was I'm glad I'm alive.

   I got home from work Tuesday and sat down on the couch and was
talking on the phone to a friend and things started shaking.
   The dog started going crazy
   I hung up, stood up and grabbed the dog. A lamp blew off the
mantle and headed toward the opposite wall of a 20-by-30-foot
living room. I realized things were serious and I headed under the
dining room table with the dog.
   Things were not just falling off the shelf but flying around the
room and coming to rest in other parts of the house. We had
interior decoration done by mixmaster.
   All the things flew around. The salt shaker is in a drawer that
opened and closed itself, and the pepper is in the computer room.
The computer's OK, but the printer got trashed.
   Structurally we believe our home is OK. The main room is a
redwood log cabin from the late 1800s, and it is sitting on a
flooring of river rock.
   We're putting up our neighbors, two adults and a baby.
   On Highway 17, there are no cars out there and you feel the
world has come to an end. But after you get to Los Gatos it's
business as usual. It plays tricks with your mind. You ask, ``What
happened to me? Did I dream this?''

   I was in my residence (Camelot Hotel in the Tenderloin
district)... sitting on my bed, and I felt the shaking real kind of
slight at first, and then it started getting real intense and real
rumbling, so I went over ... and opened the door.
   One of my neighbors was there ... and she was frightened and
scared. So I told her, ``We'll get down in the doorway.'' Then the
shaking got real intense, and at that point I thought the building
was going to come down.
   We went outside, and the whole top of our building had shifted,
like the whole sixth floor had shifted to the right. ... We went
back in our building a little later that night, but then the fire
department said the whole building was going to collapse, it was
unsafe to be in, and they evacuated us into a bus and brought us
here (a shelter at the Moscone Center).
   That's what happened.
   Naturally, like anyone else, I was hoping I'd survive. I was
kind of freaked out whether or not as I was going to live through
it or not, because it really seemed at that time the building was
going to come down. It was that intense.
   It was wavy, rumbling, a lot of rattling, shaking, like a bomb
exploded underground, in slow motion.

   I was watching the television at home ... the station that
didn't have verbal communication with their helicopter.
   The commentators were trying to guess what they were seeing from
the air. Working here and knowing the area, I knew that was the
Cypress structure that had come down. And I knew that my wife had
just got off work at 5 o'clock. I waited for 2{ hours in front of
the TV.
   They were in a van pool when it hit. They were heading to get on
the structure to go up the corridor to head to the North Bay, where
I live. She was about two blocks (away) in traffic when the quake
hit.
   After the quake stopped they knew they had been in an earthquake
and they tried to head as fast as possible to get on the structure
(and) when they made the turn ... they saw that it had collapsed.
   They veered back into Oakland, through Berkeley and onto I-80
that way and went straight home. She said they were pretty
devastated because they travel that corridor every day and they
know that the cars were jammed up there.

   The scene most vivid in my mind is when we were walking up the
stairs at night to take some women to the ferry and we saw these
waves of people walking down Market Street.
   They were in the middle of the street, on islands, on sidewalks,
everybody calm, nobody panicking, all talking, people who had never
met before.
   You could smell smoke in the air, hear sirens from the police
cars, ambulances and fire trucks. It was like a scene out of a
horror movie or a war film. We were at ground zero.

   A 122-year-old brass cannon
affectionately named ``Doug'' is missing again from a prominent
perch on the Wesleyan University campus.
   The Douglas Cannon, which has been the target of storied student
thefts throughout the 20th century, was purloined late Friday, said
Wesleyan spokesman Bobby Wayne Clark. It presumably was taken by
students, he said.
   The 140-pound cannon was taken less than a month after it was
remounted, despite that experts had been called in to make the
cannon theft-proof.
   On Friday, one brass mount was cut though, and the cannon and
the other mount removed entirely.
   The cannon has ventured on other student-sponsored trips before,
including to Paris and the United Nations. In one brazen theft in
1982, it was stolen from a supposedly secure locker in Wesleyan's
public safety office.
   The cannon has also made surprise appearances at various campus
functions periodically, Clark said. At Wesleyan's 150th anniversary
party in 1981, it was found hidden inside a giant birthday cake.
   ``It's Doug's fate to be stolen,'' said Robert G. McKelvey, who
coordinated the cannon restoration.
   The 29-inch long cannon was cast in 1867 for a Middletown
artillery battery and named in honor of then-Mayor Benjamin Douglas.

<HEAD>New Boost for the Bust in 1990</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safaris, Caribbean soirees and circus gymnasts were
just a few of the themes at Saturday's shows of 1990 summer
fashions. Curvy and feminine clothes emphasized the bust in
virtually all designs, from Claude Montana to Jean-Louis Scherrer.
   Montana, who has just been chosen to design couture for the
house of Lanvin, seemed to be skimping on his ideas for his own
house, perhaps saving up for January when he'll show for Lanvin. He
concentrated on rigorously honed-down curvaceous clothes, much
softer than many of his past styles.
   There was hardly a skirt in sight.
   Montana put very few accessories on the figure-hugging corsair
body suits and belted, drawstring-tied jackets with shorts. In
spicy shades of cinnamon, clove, curry, saffron and dill green,
some of the safari jackets with saddlebag pockets had daring
V-shaped decolletes.
   Memorable for color and shape were the tomato linen shortie
coats split into several panels, with pushed-up puffy sleeves worn
over shorts or long pants.
   Another terrific look is in Montana's version of the
opaque-transparent theme popular all over town. He paired long and
sober raw silk or linen jackets with flowing pleated sheer
georgette crepe pants.
   His most revealing styles were centered on see-through silk and
viscose cobweb tops _ another favorite Paris theme done daringly
here, paired with clinging silk stretch tights.
   Also in the ``second-skin'' vein were the clinging outfits with
matching string or rope decor strung like strands of pearls across
a shoulder, at the hip or on bare backs, the sober shades of brown,
rust, khaki and putty merely emphasizing the curvy figure
underneath.
   This was perfect in a sheath topped with a transparent, wide
organza jacket, showing the designer's sheer perfection of line,
although it's not for timid souls with figure problems.
   For Scherrer, there were no endangered species, as he brought
out every kind of animal print _ leopards, tigers, zebras, often
best worn by his favorite model, his blond daughter Laetitia.
   The big cat prints pounced onstage in bermudas and billowing
tops, in gracefully wrapped and draped dresses and bathing suits
cut out to show lots of skin, and even decorated lapels of tailored
suits.
   He, too, went for a transparent-solid look, combining sheer
animal-print blouses and pants with solid linen safari jackets.
Wild-animal prints are already all over the streets here, but it
still looked great at Scherrer.
   His more sober daytime ideas included soft paisley prints in
suits, sharp navy coat dresses with striking white lapels decollete
to the waist, and a range of lovely softly checked and glen plaid
pastel suits in silk and cool wools.
   Scherrer also laid on a Caribbean soiree. It was a blazing color
show, with casual, draped sarongs, knotted shirts and shorts or
cropped-pants outfits in multicolored batik flower patterns.
   His gorgeous evening clothes were delicately edged in arum
lilies, magnolias and garlands of sequined embroidery by master
embroiderer Francois Lesage. Coming out in satin sheaths, silk
pajamas or ball gowns with full organza skirts, the women had tank
tops or bustiers, always underlining the female curves.
   Issey Miyake's show was full of stretchy gymnasts' suits and
corsair pants, spotlighting the sportier side of summer fashion.
   His yellow, royal blue or red-and-white striped or
harlequin-patterned stretch cotton pant suits with their boxy
jackets would make a jaunty entry to the beach scene. The
turtle-shaped or chrome-hooped handbags added wonderful touches of
wit to this fun show of bouncy clothes.
   Yellow, black and white or turquoise tailcoats paired with
bicolored corsairs or cropped wider pants were another theme.
   An artist with silhouettes as well as fabrics, Miyake also
showed some great new shirt shapes over short-shorts, the tops
centered on triangular elbows in dolman sleeves, in striped cotton
or in pleated, stiffened fabrics Miyake often favors.
   Dressier and more feminine clothes were shown by Michel Goma at
Balenciaga in a show that was not only full of peppy stuff, but
sometimes had touches of the inimitable Balenciaga in couture
shapes and luxurious silk fabrics.
   The champagne lace and silk tunics and lean short skirts looked
just as easy to wear as the brightly colored crepe de chine
flowered dresses with long linen jackets.
   Some lovely white piques with caramel organza touches looked
great when cut out at the back _ as did the multicolored flowered
organza dance dresses, or the pastel crepe georgette pleated
Charleston dresses edged in lace at the hems.
   The billowy organza evening dresses were perfect for debutantes
and other young-hearted party girls.
   Most remarkable was the royal blue bustier dress with a huge bow
at the top, a big bell-shaped flounced skirt shorter in front to
reveal buttoned organza leggings underneath. It was worthy of
Balenciaga.

   Several hundred people sang ``Dixie'' on
Saturday at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the death
of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
   More than 150 people in Civil War uniforms and period clothing,
plus a similar number of spectators in modern clothing, watched a
re-enactment of Davis being sworn in as president in 1861 atop the
Capitol steps in Montgomery. Richard Couch, portraying Davis, stood
on a bronze star that marks the spot where a country was divided.
   Some spectators carried Rebel flags and most joined in singing
``Dixie'' during the program, which included historical lectures
and displays and a rifle and cannon salute by Civil War re-enactors
from throughout Alabama.
   Norman Dasinger, state commander of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans, said Davis' death a century ago was important to mark
because there was so much misunderstanding about the Civil War.
Davis was 81 when he died in Louisiana.
   ``The ignorance is so pervasive about the war being over
slavery. Out of the 50,000 Alabamians who died in the war, 90
percent owned no one,'' said Dasinger, a professor of education
administration at Jacksonville State University.
   ``The majority of the people here today believe Jefferson Davis
was right and I do, too,'' Dasinger said. ``That does not mean we
want to have a slave nation. We believe in individual rights and
freedoms and state's rights.''
   David Toifel, a history teacher at Hillsdale Middle School in
Mobile who had the idea for the ceremony, said that one reason
Southerners loved Davis so much after the war was that ``he never
admitted what he did was wrong.''
   One of the programs at the State Archives included a film of a
re-enactment in 1914 of Davis' swearing-in by real Confederate
veterans. In that ceremony, they raised the first flag of the
Confederacy atop the Capitol _ the kind of flag that actually flew
over the building when it was the capitol of the Confederacy _
rather than the Confederate battle flag that flies there now.
   The Confederate battle flag has been the focus of protests,
including one on Feb. 2, 1988, that resulted in the arrest of 14
black state legislators who made a symbolic attempt to rip it down.
Black leaders contend the flag has become a symbol of racism
through its use by the Ku Klux Klan.
   Saturday's ceremony attracted no protests.
   The ceremony did bring two sons of Confederate veterans _
80-year-old Eddie Jordan of Selma and 83-year-old Willard ``Fred''
Kennedy of Gadsden.
   ``My daddy never owned a slave. He fought 3{ years in the war as
a volunteer. He was fighting for principle,'' Jordan said. ``When
the Union told him, you've got to get rid of slaves, he didn't like
it. It was the principle. Most people don't like to be told what to
do.''

<HEAD>Urged to Act With Speed, FEMA Centers to Open Sunday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal relief officials, under criticism
for responding sluggishly after Hurricane Hugo, said Saturday that
disaster-aid centers will open Sunday in seven earthquake-ravaged
counties.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has processed about
4,000 applications over a 24-hour hotline since Thursday, a day
after President Bush issued a disaster declaration for parts of
northern California.
   But those who lost their homes in one of the nation's costliest
natural disasters should expect to wait seven to 10 days for a
check to pay for temporary housing once their applications are
processed and verified.
   ``There is no magic wand,'' said FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan.
``People have to understand that FEMA does not have people standing
by waiting for disasters to happen. It takes us a little time to
get rolling and do it right.''
   Until federal money is approved, those displaced can seek
emergency shelter with the Red Cross or pay for a hotel and seek
reimbursement from the government, FEMA said.
   At least one center will be open by 1 p.m. Sunday in San
Francisco and the counties of Alameda, Monterrey, San Benito, Santa
Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo, according to Robert Broussard, a
FEMA official.
   At a news briefing, Broussard said FEMA wanted to make sure its
disaster centers were in structurally sound buildings.
   Local officials pleaded for quick government help, and President
Bush pledged ``no red tape'' when he toured the area Friday.
   ``We need fast action. We need checks written on the spot,''
said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.
   After Hurricane Hugo slammed South Carolina on Sept. 21, it took
FEMA seven days to open its first disaster center. U.S. Sen. Fritz
Hollings, D-S.C., called FEMA officials ``a bunch of bureaucratic
jackasses'' for the slowness of their response.
   Areas in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and North and South
Carolina are still under disaster declarations because of Hurricane
Hugo.
   In addition to money for temporary housing, the government can
provide low interest loans, cash grants of up to $10,400 for
individuals, jobless pay for those not covered by unemployment
insurance and advice on how to claim losses on their federal tax
returns.

   Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency reported the death
toll from Friday's crash at 64, but that could not be confirmed.

   The widow of Swedish prime minister
Olof Palme said Saturday that police and the press ``sabotaged''
the inquiry into her husband's murder and the subsequent trial.
   Lisbeth Palme was the chief witness against a local career
criminal, Christer Pettersson, whose July conviction in the slaying
was thrown out earlier this month by an appeals court, which cited
insufficient evidence.
   Mrs. Palme made her first direct public comment on Sweden's
``trial of the century'' in a 30-minute TV interview. She accused
the Swedish tabloids and other media of interfering in the inquiry,
buying information from sources, including police, and hounding her.
   Mrs. Palme also lambasted the police. She said she knew of
officers who accepted money for leaks, but she did not identify
them.
   Mrs. Palme herself has been criticized by the press for
hindering the investigation into her husband's death by setting
pre-conditions for her participation in police lineups and court
testimony.
   Her demand that any recording of her testimony be banned was
granted in court.
   In Saturday's TV interview, Mrs. Palme said she stuck to her
testimony that 43-year old Christer Pettersson was her husband's
murderer.
   Palme was killed Feb. 28, 1986, while he walked with his wife on
a Stockholm street.
   Mrs. Palme testified she saw Pettersson when she looked up from
her dying husband and was ``100 percent'' certain he was the gunman.
   Legal experts said that unequivocal statement would prohibit her
from testifying against anyone else accused of the crime.

   The cost of attending some of the nation's
most prestigious colleges is virtually the same, according to a
survey, prompting the government to investigate whether the
tuitions are fixed.
   In the 1989-90 school year, four schools generally considered
among the best ranged by less than $250 total tuition, room and
board costs: $19,164 at Stanford, $19,207 at Princeton, $19,310 at
Yale, and $19,395 at Harvard, according to their catalogs.
   Under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department are at least
55 schools, according to a survey by The Chronicle of Higher
Education, a trade publication. The probe apparently does not
include public colleges and universities.
   Investigators are looking at the extent in which administrators
compare financial information with other schools before setting
tuition levels.
   School officials deny any wrongdoing, and experts in antitrust
law say the government would have a difficult time establishing a
strong case against the schools.
   But the probe has focused a spotlight on college's tuition
practices and has put extra pressure on administrators to justify a
decade of tuition increases that have outpaced inflation.
   ``Regardless of whether actual wrongdoing is found, the
investigation can only benefit students and families, whose ability
to pay often does not match the demands of greedy colleges,'' said
an editorial in the South Bend (Ind.) Tribune.
   Investigators would need to look no further than the colleges'
own catalogs, under the listing for tuition, room and board for
evidence of a rigged education market, critics said.
   The University of Southern California, at $17,610 in total
costs, falls behind Stanford and the top Ivy League schools but
compares in price closely with many other California private
schools, with costs of $17,877 at Occidental, $17,050 at the
University of Pacific and $17,530 at Claremont McKenna College.
   School administrators say they find nothing surprising in the
similarity in costs, and they say there is a strong motivation to
keep tuitions in line with schools with which they compete for
students.
   Administrators also say that the relatively public nature of the
budget process _ including open meetings with school boards and
faculty _ makes exchange of financial information inevitable.
   But the Justice Department suspects that the exchange of
information is more formal and less public than administrators
admit, legal scholars say. The department is also studying whether
top universities share information on how much scholarship aid they
offer individual students.
   Former USC administrator Taylor W. Meloan said that before final
tuition decisions are made, school officials commonly talk to
administrators at other schools to see what tuitions are being
considered.
   ``You call around and say, `What is your tuition going to be
this coming year? What is going to be your increase?''' said
Meloan, now a USC marketing professor. ``Schools don't want to be
too far out of line. You don't want to be higher than prestigious
universities. So you may lag just a little bit behind.''
   USC officials deny trading information in the manner described
by Meloan, and noted that he has not been an administrator for
about 10 years.
   ``We don't do it that way now, and we didn't do it that way
then,'' said university spokeswoman Martha Harris. ``Maybe he was
the only one doing it.''
   Officials at other schools also deny such practices, but
acknowledge that it is virtually impossible to keep many tuition
matters private.
   Administrators at Stanford, for instance, meet in open session
with the Academic Senate in December to discuss, among other
things, the possible tuition increase for the upcoming term.
   Long before the university's Board of Trustees approves the
final tuition in February or March, administrators at other
colleges have an accurate picture of where Stanford is headed in
tuition and other costs.
   Stanford, in turn, also gets information from other schools
through open forums, said Tim Warner, Stanford's director of
budgets.
   ``We don't ask other universities for information,'' he said.
   Even if the Justice Department finds evidence of information
exchange, it still faces problems establishing a strong antitrust
case, said Lawrence A. Sullivan, law professor at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall Law School
   The primarily problem is convincing a court that the few
prestigious schools that allegedly exchange information make up an
education market of their own, regardless of the thousands of other
schools in the country that charge different amounts, said Sullivan.
   The government would be hard-pressed to prove that a more
broadly defined education market could be affected by the actions
of a few schools, he said.
   ``Quite frankly, my own top of the head reaction is that if all
they have is an information exchange, they haven't got one hell of
an antitrust case,'' Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Uzbekistan Parliament Replaces Premier, Passes Language Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premier of Uzbekistan, who has been struggling
with growing ethnic nationalism and unrest, was replaced by a
younger Communist Party official, Tass reported Saturday.
   Uzbekistan's parliament also passed a compromise language law
that failed to satisfy Uzbek nationalists who have taken to the
streets several times in the past week to protest. Hundreds of
people were reported arrested.
   The parliament removed Premier Gairat Kadyrov at a two-day
session that ended Saturday and replaced him with 48-year-old
Mirakhmat Mirkasymov, a longtime Uzbek party official, Tass said.
   Kadyrov, 61, had been premier of the central Asian republic
since 1984. Tass said he would be transferred to a new post but did
not elaborate.
   Kadyrov had struggled in recent months swelling Uzbek
nationalism, which led to formation of a grass-roots political
movement and ethnic unrest that killed 100 people in the Fergana
Valley.
   The new language law fueled further unrest. Tass said the law
would make Uzbek the official langauge of the republic, correcting
the ``historical injustice'' dictator Josef Stalin committed in the
1930s by forcing Russian on the population.
   At the same time, Tass said, Russian and other languages common
in Uzbekistan, such as Tajik, could still be used by all groups for
``inter-ethnic communications.''
   A spokesman for the Uzbek Writers' Union said militia units
continued to patrol the republic's capital of Tashkent on Saturday
to prevent further demonstrations by the new grass-roots movement,
known as Berlik, or Unity.
   ``All the streets and squares are blocked by the police,'' said
the spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. ``There is
no traffic, but people keep gathering in groups with slogans
addressing their demands.''
   A similar law passed in the republic of Moldavia last summer
raised protests by ethnic Moldavians and prolonged strikes by
Russian speakers.
   In the Baltic and Caucasus regions as well as other areas of the
country, popular movements have openly held meetings and protests
and won the support of many top government officials.
   But in Tashkent, hundreds of people have been arrested since
Thursday during Berlik-sponsored protests, including the movement's
leader, Abdurakhim Pulatov, group sources said.
   Residents said they did not know if Mirkasymov had played a role
in the efforts to suppress the movement.
   He has held senior Communist Party jobs in the republic for the
past 16 years, Tass said.
   Kadyrov was reprimanded at a regional party congress in 1986 for
failing to ease the chronic unemployment in the republic of 20
million people. Such criticism has persisted.
   Last year, Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, ridiculed
Kadyrov for his handling of a land and water dispute. The affair
climaxed when an angry crowd cornered Kadyrov, who had to radio
guards for help.
   In the Fergana Valley in June, Uzbek nationalists clashed with
minority Meskhetian Turks. Activists attributed much of the
violence to pent-up anger over economic conditions in the poor,
cotton-growing republic.
   Also Saturday, Tass said the Uzbek parliament passed a law
banning ethnic restrictions on the right to vote.
   A recent law championed by Estonion nationalists in their Baltic
republic set residency requirements for voting and touched off
strikes by Russians and other ethnic groups.

   Workers used concrete saws and blowtorches
Saturday to cut through a collapsed section of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, operating under a tight deadline to
reopen a major link knocked out by Tuesday's earthquake.
   The California Department of Transportation had hoped to remove
the collapsed section of roadway on Saturday, but that was likely
delayed until Monday by the decision to saw the 250-ton piece in
half, said Greg Bayol of the Transportation Department.
   The Transportation Department has set a four-week deadline and a
$1 million pricetag for reopening the 8.5-mile bridge, which
carries 270,000 cars each day. But some officials have said the
repairs could take two months.
   Bayol said officials decided overnight Saturday to avoid
unnecessarily adding stress to the tower supporting the roadway
piece, which is 50 feet long, 60 feet wide and holds five lanes of
traffic.
   ``They were afraid if they lifted 250 tons the shifting of
weight would be more of a problem than if they cut it,'' he said.
``It would be more safe for everyone concerned if they cut the slab
into two sections and lifted it out one at a time.''
   The pieces will be lowered by a 190-foot barge-based crane onto
a waiting barge. The section is to be repaired and reassembled at
nearby Alameda, Bayol said.
   The cutting should not delay the reopening, because other repair
work can continue during the weekend, he said.
   A section of the upper span of the bridge shook loose during
Tuesday's earthquake and crashed down on the lower roadway,
destroying several vehicles and killing a 23-year-old Berkeley
woman whose car sped over the edge moments after the gap opened.
Television pictures of the pitched upper section provided the first
graphic indication of the strength of the quake.
   Workers are using diamond-tipped saws to cut an 18-inch-wide
strip through the concrete roadway, and blowtorches to cut through
the steel frame, said Jim Drago of the Transportation Department.
   Repair and reopening of the bridge is being closely watched in
the Bay Area because the span is vital to commuters. For now,
residents will have to rely on jampacked Bay Area Rapid Transit
systems and a makeshift fleet of donated ferry boats.
   Officials are still unclear why only the one section of the
bridge failed, Bayol said.
   Theories center on the notion that the collapsed section was at
the point where the different construction techniques used to build
the 1930s-era bridge are joined, Bayol said. Jutting west out of
Oakland the bridge is supported underneath only by towers, while
the central cantilevered section is held up by steel girders from
above as well as towers.
   ``This one section is unique to the whole bridge,'' Bayol said.
``It was more rigid. Maybe it didn't move as much.''
   Jim Roberts, chief of structures for the state transportation
department, said the damaged section appears to be in good shape.
If it can be salvaged, it will be put back in place as soon as
possible, he said.
   The bottom section of the two-tiered bridge suffered three
puncture holes, opening portions of the roadway to the water below,
Bayol said. Transportation Department officials have given
conflicting accounts of whether that section can be repaired, or
whether it will have to be replaced.

   The Foreign Ministry accused Syria of
downing a Turkish airplane on a geographical survey mission
Saturday, killing all five crew members.
   Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said a propeller plane of the
Turkish Title Deeds Office was shot down Saturday morning by two
Syrian MiG-21s that violated Turkish air space. He said all five
crew members were killed.
   Sungar said the plane was doing survey work 12 miles from the
Syrian border when it was attacked. He said it split in two and was
found later in mountains in Hatay province, which borders Syria.
   Sungar told reporters that Syria's ambassador to Turkey, Abdul
Aziz Al-Rifai, was called to the Foreign Ministry for ``vehement
protest of the incident.''
   He said Turkey asked Syria for compensation and an explanation.
   In Damascus, Syrian officials had no immediate comment.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday signed a $9 million
aid package designed to help the political opposition running
against Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista government in next year's
election.
   The money, to be spent for general political activity such as
registering voters and getting them to the polls, is to start
flowing into the Central American country in the next 10 days to be
used during the voter registration period that concludes at the end
of October.
   The stated purpose of the aid package, which Congress sent to
Bush on Friday, is to level the playing field for the underfinanced
opposition. The money is to go to registering Nicaraguans,
including thousands who have left their homeland, and paying for
poll monitoring, vote counting and other election-related
activities.
   However, because of Nicaraguan regulation of foreign
contributions, some of the money _ as much as $2 million _ probably
will end up with the Sandinista-controlled national election
council.
   Critics allege the package is merely an attempt by the United
States to buy out the Sandinistas through political influence after
years of failure to oust them by militarily backing the Contra
rebels.
   But White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that the step reflects administration hopes that through
fair elections ``Nicaragua will join other countries that have made
the transition from repression to freedom.''
   The aid, which passed Congress easily, ``represents another step
forward in our efforts to promote democracy in countries that have
been deprived of political and economic freedom,'' Fitzwater's
statement said. ``Around the world, the tide of democracy is
advancing as more and more authoritarian and totalitarian regimes
realize that human progress is inseparable from the principles of
liberty.''
   Bush's action comes just before his two-day trip to Costa Rica
for a hemispheric democracy celebration where Nicaragua's President
Daniel Ortega also will attend, along with many heads of state from
the western hemisphere.
   They are to participate on Friday and Saturday in a centennial
celebration of Costa Rican democracy hosted by that nation's
President Oscar Arias.
   Bush earlier acknowledged in a letter to lawmakers that because
of the Nicaraguan election laws, as much as $2 million of the
package would have to go to the Sandinista-controlled Supreme
Electoral Council. But he said that situation should not ``be used
as a transparent attempt to prevent the United States from helping
its democratic friends.''
   Under Nicaraguan rules on foreign money donated to the electoral
process, 50 percent of the money spent in certain categories must
go the Supreme Electoral Council. The council oversees and
regulates the election process.
   Most of the U.S. aid is to go through the National Endowment for
Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that promotes democratic
elections around the world to pay for ostensibly nonpartisan
activities like voter registration, election monitoring and party
building.
   Part of the money also will go to independent groups that will
monitor the Feb. 25 elections, including one headed by former
President Carter.
   The legislation was vague on how the money will be used, but
congressional observers said it appeared that up to $6 million
could go directly to the National Opposition Union, a coalition
group that is backing the presidential candidacy of opposition
newspaper publisher Violeta Chamorro.
   However, money is not to go directly into her campaign coffers
or be used for advertising to promote her candidacy, backers say.
   The National Endowment's charter forbids such partisan campaign
activity. But administration officials believe that spending money
on the democratic process will ultimately benefit Mrs. Chamorro,
who is at a heavy financial disadvantage to the pervasive
Sandinista Party.
   Bush, in his letter lobbying Congress to pass the package, said
Mrs. Chamorro's party ``needs our assistance desperately.''
   ``With the funds provided for in this legislation, the National
Endowment for Democracy and other organizations will work to
strengthen democratic institutions in Nicaragua so that truly free
and fair elections may be held,'' Fitzwater said Saturday.
   The $9 million is money reprogrammed from the State Department's
Agency for International Development.
   An administration official said $5 million will go to NED to be
dispensed to Mrs. Chamorro's group, while the other $4 million will
go to election monitoring groups and to the Supreme Electoral
Council to match money for UNO's activities that fall under the 50
percent rule.

   A Navstar navigation satellite
rocketed into orbit Saturday to join a network of spacecraft that
guide bombers, warships, missiles and ground troops with pinpoint
accuracy.
   An Air Force Delta 2 rocket propelled the $65 million satellite
into an orbit ranging out to 11,000 miles high following a fiery
liftoff that brilliantly illuminated the pre-dawn sky.
   ``The satellite has been picked up; we sent commands and it's
responding as expected,'' said Air Force Col. Marty Runkle, the
mission director. It appeared to be a normal mission, he said.
   Information on rocket performance was delayed nearly an hour
because a tracking station on Ascension Island in the south
Atlantic also was supporting the space shuttle Atlantis at the
time. Trackers there recorded the rocket data and later played it
back to the launch control center here.
   The Navstar is the fourth in a new series of spacecraft that
enable U.S. and allied military units such as planes, ships,
submarines, tanks and field troops to precisely determine their
positions to within 50 feet in any type of weather anywhere in the
world.
   They tune in on the network's radio signals, using receivers as
small as a hand-held telephone.
   The satellites also keep track of the speed of military units
within a fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a
millionth of a second.

   More than 100 anti-abortion demonstrators
were arrested Saturday after they chained shut the doors of a
clinic and shackled themselves together, police said.
   The 101 protesters, members of the Bi-state Operation Rescue
Network, were charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and
obstructing justice after their arrests at the Long Island
Gynecological Clinic, said Nassau County police spokesman, Charles
Koller.
   About 250 protesters were in place by 7 a.m., two hours before
the clinic opened, said organization spokeswoman Esther Lerach.
   Fourteen women scheduled for treatment were kept from entering,
said the clinic's manager, Lois Colasuonno.
   Police carted off some of the protestors on stretchers; others
had linked themselves together with thick metal chains that were
also attached to the building's front and rear doors. Police used
electric saws to cut the chains, Koller said.

   A canister used to move space
shuttle payloads was damaged Saturday when a crane apparently
failed and dropped a 20-ton concrete weight on it, NASA reported.
   The weight struck the top of the 65-foot-tall carrier ``striking
a door a glancing blow as it fell to the floor of the canister,'' a
statement said.
   The concrete weight being lifted out of the canister ``was just
about clear of the canister's doors when an apparent crane failure
caused the weight to fall,'' it said.
   The concrete was being used to simulate a payload for a test.
The canister is the size of a shuttle cargo bay.
   The statement said there were no injuries and an inspection was
being made to determine the extent of the damage. An investigation
of the accident was begun.
   The container is one of two available at the Kennedy Space
Center for transporting satellites and other shuttle payloads from
a processing building to the launch pad. NASA said the accident
would have no impact on launch schedules.
   The damaged canister was recently used to check out Launch Pad
39A, which has undergone renovation and is to be used for a shuttle
liftoff in December for the first time in nearly four years.
   The canister and its enclosed piece of concrete had recently
been moved from the pad to an assembly building, where the accident
took place.

   It was too hard to believe.
   A 57-year-old longshoreman, wedged behind the wheel 90 hours and
23 minutes and given up for dead, was plucked from the ruins of a
collapsed roadway after he was found alive Saturday by a worker
doing a stress check in the rubble.
   The trapped man was still buckled into his seatbelt.
   Rescue workers, drained by almost four grisly days of peeling
bodies and vehicles from the wreckage, burst into a throaty cheer
when they saw the face of burly Buck Helm, who was wearing a red
jogging suit.
   They cheered again when Helm was placed into an ambulance and
whisked to Highland Hospital five miles away.
   ``It's amazing he was extricated alive. It is phenomenal,'' said
Dr. Monica Rosenthal.
   The miracle of Interstate 880 was as startling as finding a
miner trapped for four days in a cave-in.
   Weary workers had actually suspended their grim labors Friday
night because officials feared the collapsed double-decked highway
was too unsafe. They were already talking about tearing the
remaining sections down.
   Helm's silver Chevrolet Sprint was in the flattest and most
unstable section of the 1\-mile stretch of highway that slammed
down like a concrete sandwich in Tuesday's earthquake, trapping
bodies and vehicles in the middle.
   But incredibly, it was shielded by a 3{-foot-high ripple in the
shattered concrete.
   A California Transportation Department worker, walking the
roadway in the dim morning light, was the first to spot Helm.
Stress tests were being done so workers could proceed with their
search when, at 6 a.m., something moved.
   ``He couldn't believe was he was seeing, so he brought some
others who also detected movement,'' said Bob Jacobs, deputy
director of CalTrans.
   Helm, parched and weakened by days without food and water,
nodded his head to signal he was alive.
   ``One of the guy's came running down yelling, `There's somebody
alive up there,''' said Alfred Anderson, 63, of Oliver Construction
Co. ``We'd been working here all along and we didn't realize he was
right there. It is a thrill to know somebody's going to survive
from this horrible thing.''
   Heavy rain fell briefly as rejuvenated crews scrambled to free
the miracle survivor.
   Before crews could attempt to rescue Helm, they had to reinforce
the area with a 60-foot-long steel girder stacked on top of beams
the size of telephone poles. Then rescuers with jackhammers and
concrete saws raced into action.
   Working from the side, they gouged a hole 2{ feet high and 4
feet wide through 15 feet of stubborn concrete. Rescuers burrowed
in from the passenger side and opened the car with the jaws of
life. They cut off his seat belt and freed him from the driver's
side.
   He was brought out feet first at 11:27 a.m. and lowered to the
ground on a gurney suspended from a crane.
   Helm lapsed in and out of consciousness, according to paramedic
Diana Moore, 25, the first person to reach him. She put him on
oxygen but couldn't give him an intravenous injection because the
space was too cramped.
   ``He was very anxious to get out,'' said Ms. Moore. ``He was
mainly moaning. The only thing that he was that was understandable
was, `When am I going to get out of here?'''

<TEXT>
   On Veterans' Day, more than 20 years after
enemy mortar blew away most of his body below the waist, Freddie
Paul Heugel rejoins his comrades who sacrificed their lives in
Vietnam.
   The name of Heugel, who died in 1984 of complications from his
war wounds, has been inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in
Washington. It will be dedicated at a Nov. 11 ceremony with the
names of 19 other servicemen recently added to the black granite
wall, which carries the names of more than 58,000 Americans.
   His mother, Maggie Heugel of Taylor, Mich., will be there.
   ``He would be very proud,'' Mrs. Heugel said in a telephone
interview from her home. A soft-spoken woman who works the
all-night shift making salads for airline dinners, she still finds
it hard to discuss her son without crying.
   Truman A. Strong might not be able to attend the ceremony, but
the event will be special nonetheless for the Livonia, Mich.,
dentist. Strong launched the campaign to have Heugel's name
inscribed on the memorial and enlisted the help of Rep. William
Ford, D-Mich., who interceded with the Pentagon.
   ``He was the nicest kid I've ever seen ... very easygoing,''
Strong said. ``He deserves to be on that memorial as much as
anybody.''
   Heugel's story begins in 1968 when he was 19 and working at a
Dearborn Heights, Mich., service station when the draft notice came.
   By Feb. 23, 1969 _ the day his life changed forever _ he was
Cpl. Heugel, assistant gunner on a 105mm howitzer.
   As he manned his weapon in a bunker two miles from the Ho Chi
Minh Trail, a mortar shell exploded nearby, wounding a buddy.
Heugel ran to summon a medic.
   ``Then I got it, too,'' Heugel said in a 1974 interview with The
Detroit News. ``I remember getting hit and smelling the gunpowder
and then falling over backward. Then there was a medic leaning over
me saying, `Oh, my God. Oh, my God.'''
   He was evacuated to Japan, where doctors rated his survival
chances as practically nil. Telegrams were sent to Michigan urging
his family to hurry to his bedside.
   One physician, however, suggested a risky operation that would
involve further amputations and removal of 80 percent of Heugel's
spine. It would mean he would never even sit up again, but he might
live.
   Heugel resisted.
   Ford's office helped Mrs. Heugel catch a flight to Tokyo, where
she persuaded her son to undergo the surgery. He spent four years
convalescing in hospitals, repeatedly confounding predictions that
he would die within months.
   With sheer grit and help from friends, he managed to lead a
productive life despite being permanently confined to a prone
position on a hospital gurney.
   Heugel taught himself to drive a specially equipped van,
controlling the brakes, gears and accelerator with a single lever.
He and his mother drove to the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville,
Tenn., and to Disney World in Orlando, Fla. A Veterans of Foreign
Wars post raised money for an elevator and recreation room in
Heugel's home. He read, played pool and poker, and took up
photography.
   ``We had a great time together,'' Mrs. Heugel said. ``Everybody
that knew him loved him. He cheered up people who came to see him.''
   He also became a volunteer in Ford's congressional campaigns,
driving workers around the district and making telephone calls.
   ``I have an annual family birthday picnic, and he'd come,'' Ford
said. ``People would marvel at how he'd drive up in his van, wheel
himself out on his gurney. ... His courage was remarkable. I never
heard a bitter word out of him, that he had gotten a raw deal, that
anybody owed him anything.''
   But life was difficult. Heugel required heavy doses of
painkillers and he was constantly returning to the local veterans'
hospital for dialysis and other treatment. He developed cirrhosis
of the liver from a blood transfusion, and toward the end his heart
deteriorated.
   No one disputed Heugel's fitness for a spot on the Vietnam
memorial when his name was submitted in 1987. But because of the
strict qualification standards and red tape, it took a year to win
the Pentagon's approval.
   For Mrs. Heugel, the passage of time has made it no easier to
understand the war and her son's fate. ``I don't even watch the war
movies on TV. I can't,'' she said. ``I don't know why it had to
happen. Before my son went to Vietnam ... he never said nothing
like `I don't want to go' but he just said, `Mom, why do we have to
go and fight people we don't even know?'''
   Heugel died May 12, 1984, at age 35.

<HEAD>Critics Say California's Vow to Fix Roads Is Politics, Not Planning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Earthquake experts contended Saturday
the state's rush to strengthen elevated roadways like the Oakland
stretch that crushed scores of motorists smacks more of politics
than much-needed safety planning.
   The sudden activity demonstrates again that state government
often reacts to the most visible results of the last quake, while
ignoring warnings of what is likely to happen in future temblors,
some state experts said.
   ``There are too few people in power _ political visionaries _
who have a strong will to lead us to better prepare for future
quakes,'' said Richard Eisner, who heads the state-funded Bay Area
Earthquake Preparedness Project.
   ``Of course, we have to look back, but we must begin to look
forward too'' and devote more resources to preparing for
earthquakes, he said.
   But other observers asserted Californians would never pay the
billions of dollars needed to prepare for all quake scenarios.
Given resources limited by tax-cutting Proposition 13 as well as
pressing needs elsewhere, the most sensible alternative is to act
on lessons learned in past quakes.
   ``You're always short of money for those freeways and other
things,'' said former Gov. Pat Brown. ``Earthquakes are so seldom,
you know, and you probably think things should be done but they're
a low priority.''
   He said it was unfair to fault government for simply fixing
problems revealed in past quakes, given lack of money to do more.
   ``We learn more every time there's an earthquake, and we act on
it. That's what we should be doing,'' added Caltrans Chief Engineer
Bill Schaefer.
   But Ed Hensley, a top official with the state Seismic Safety
Commission, said the swift move to speed improvements of Oakland's
Interstate 880 only after it claimed so many lives appears to be a
political reaction.
   The highway's apparent flaws were just some of many earthquake
hazards long noted in dusty government reports, he said.
   Hensley said a lengthy 1982 state study on effects of a big
quake in the Bay Area noted what some consulting engineers suspect
contributed to I-880's collapse _ extremely unstable ground beneath
the highway.
   The study predicted the former marsh would liquefy in a big
quake. ``So far as I know, nobody at the top paid attention to that
study,'' nor to his own Seismic Safety Commission research on
likely future earthquake effects, Hensley said.
   ``These documents seem to be taken as interesting academic
exercises until something happens,'' Hensley said.
   Jim Roberts, a top structural engineer for the California
Transportation Department, said Friday that Gov. George Deukmejian
``obviously is going to speed up'' research to find ways to
quake-proof the 1\ miles of I-880 that collapsed, killing scores of
motorists.
   The 1950s-era double-decker freeway is among four such
structures in the Bay Area. Another, the Embarcadero Freeway in San
Francisco, was severely damaged in Tuesday's quake and shut down
for lengthy repair. The two others, a portion of I-280 and the
Central Viaduct, received less damage.
   Roberts confirmed that the four structures' earthquake
stability, particularly their aged double-support columns, have
worried engineers for years. He admitted that warnings came even
from within his own department, including a May 31 memorandum that
mentioned the need to act soon to bolster some multi-column bridges.
   The transportation department, however, has put off column work
on the freeways pending more study. Instead, it is readying a $55
million effort to strengthen ``single-column'' freeways as a result
of the 1971 San Fernando Valley earthquake, which severely damaged
such roads, Roberts said.
   He also acknowledged the department hadn't asked for research
money to seek technology to strengthen freeways like I-880 until
after the 1987 Whittier quake, when more flaws were revealed in
multi-columned structures.
   Now the department will seek $200 million to $300 million to
strengthen the structures once research is finished, he said.
   Since the 1971 quake, the department has completed ``first
phase'' work on 1,300 bridges, including double-columned bridge
entryways like I-880, to bolster horizontal decking. Ironically,
installation of strengthening cables may have contributed to
1-880's collapse by pulling down sections of the roadway jarred
loose by the quake, said Dr. Pyotr Moncarz, a Palo Alto engineer.
   ``You can talk to 100 engineers and get 100 different answers''
as to why the section collapsed, retorted Caltrans' Schaefer, who
added that the department will spare no effort to learn causes of
the bridge failure.

<HEAD>2,000 Aftershocks and More Expected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 aftershocks have been
recorded since the big earthquake Oct. 17, government seismologists
said Saturday as they warned of the risk of further damage.
   The aftershocks are expected to last for several more days, with
some strong enough to cause additional harm, especially to
structures weakened in the original 6.9 quake, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey.
   An aftershock measuring 4.6 rattled the quake area anew Saturday
afternoon. The USGS said it was centered about 8 miles northeast of
Santa Cruz, just a few miles from the epicenter of the big quake.
   Although the aftershocks are generally decreasing in magnitude,
there is still a small chance of a strong temblor measuring 5.0 or
more on the Richter scale of ground movement in the next few days,
said USGS seismologist William Bakun.
   The 6.9 quake relieved strain on the San Andreas fault in the
southern Santa Cruz Mountains, greatly reducing the chances of an
equally powerful quake in the same spot over the next 50 years,
said geologist Bill Ellsworth.
   But the quake did nothing to reduce the chances of another big
temblor along a 25-mile stretch of the San Andreas north of the
Oct. 17 rupture, or along any of the other faults in California,
Ellsworth said.
   ``There are a number of small segments within the Bay area that
are estimated to have a reasonably high chance of rupturing in a
magnitude 7 earthquake during the next 30 years,'' Ellsworth said.
   Three segments, two along the Hayward fault on the east side of
San Francisco Bay and one along the San Andreas, each have about a
20 percent chance of breaking in the 30-year period, he said.
   ``There are many other faults in the Bay area, most of which we
do not have the same kinds of geological information to build these
kinds of forecasts,'' Ellsworth said. ``So in some sense the
long-term forecasts for the Bay region, the chance of another
magnitude 7 earthquake in the next 30 years, is probably an
understatement of the probability.''
   As of Saturday, 17 aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or larger and 71
measuring at least 3.0 had been recorded, the USGS said. The
largest was the 5.2 temblor that occurred 37 minutes after the main
shock Tuesday evening. The second largest was a 5.0 that occurred
at 3:14 a.m. Thursday.
   ``Because of this continuing hazard, we are urging that
earthquake preparedness measures continue to be taken, and that
extreme caution be exercised in and around damaged structures,''
said USGS geologist Thomas Holzer.

   Dogged rescuers punching through concrete
pulled a burly longshoreman alive Saturday from the rubble of an
Oakland freeway destroyed by an earthquake four days earlier.
   Onlookers burst into cheers as Buck Helm, 57, was removed from
his subcompact car and again when he waved weakly from a stretcher.
   ``When he came out, it was just an incredible and a wonderful
sight to see after he had been there some 89 hours,'' Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson said. ``That gives hope to everyone in terms of what
the potential is. Who knows what is under there?''
   Helm had asked paramedics crawling into a 3{-foot-high cavern,
``When am I going to get out of here?'' He asked doctors for a
drink of milk when he arrived at Highland General Hospital.
   He probably could have survived two more days, doctors said.
   Workers have toiled for days uncovering bodies from the mayhem
of the 1\-mile-long stretch of double-decked Interstate 880, and by
Saturday there had been little hope of finding anyone alive. Helm
was the first person rescued alive since Tuesday night.
   Damage estimates from Tuesday's quake stood at some $5.5
billion, and the confirmed death toll rose Saturday to 55 _ 34 of
them pulled from the remains of I-880. Dozens are still listed as
missing in Oakland, police said.
   A strong aftershock Saturday afternoon measuring 4.6 of the
Richter scale was centered eight miles northeast of Santa Cruz,
very close to the site of Tuesday's earthquake, the U.S. Geological
Survey reported. It was felt in the San Francisco area, but there
were no immediate reports of damage.
   In all, more than 2,000 aftershocks have been registered since
the initial quake.
   Helm, a 240-pound longshoreman's clerk who works in Oakland, was
pulled from a Chevrolet Sprint automobile and was rushed to
Highland, five miles from the scene, said Tom Silvey, a spokesman
for the state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento.
   Helm had a steady pulse and was in critical-guarded condition,
officials said, suffering from dehydration, kidney failure, three
broken ribs, and breathing difficulties. He had been on the missing
persons list since the disaster.
   ``I raised my hands and screamed and thanked God he's alive,''
his ex-wife, Lorene Helm, told the Cable News Network from her home
in Weaverville, 250 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   ``We figured that if anybody could make it, Buck Helm could.
He's tough. He's a fighter,'' said Dave Comport, a co-worker on the
docks.
   Asked why he thought Helm survived, his son Greg responded,
``He's an ornery old fart.''
   Rescuers said Helm was packed inside the driver's seat, not so
much pinned as trapped.
   Paramedic Diana Moore said she and other rescuers had to crawl
into an area only 3{ feet tal. Helm' seat belt proved to be an
obstacle, she said.
   He was removed from a hole punched through the car with a
jaws-of-life device, placed on a gurney and lifted out with a crane.
   ``I was overwhelmed finding him. It was a wonderful feeling,''
she said.
   ``He was very anxious to get out. He was mainly moaning,'' Ms.
Moore said. ``The only thing that he said was understandable was
`When am I going to get out of here?'''
   Dr. Michael Smith, director of trauma at Highland, said Helm was
responding to fluids and had asked for a drink of milk.
   Helm's left leg was partially crushed, causing some kidney
damage, hospital medical director Floyd Huen said. Doctors were
also checking for a skull fracture, Smith said.
   ``He was not really compressed or in too bad a condition,'' he
said.
   Helm and a co-worker had left the Oakland terminal at 5 p.m.
Tuesday in separate cars headed north, according to Comport, a
superintendent for Stevedore Services of America.
   The 6.9-magnitude quake struck at 5:04 p.m.
   ``One of his co-workers was 10 car lengths ahead when the
earthquake hit,'' Comport said. ``He knew that Buck Helm was behind
him and didn't come out. All the word on the waterfront was that
Buck Helm didn't come out.
   ``We're all ecstatic,'' he said.
   Work had been suspended Friday night at the freeway site because
the morass of concrete and twisted steel had become too unstable,
and some sections shifted as much as three inches, officials said.
   But at 6 a.m., a transportation engineer looked through one of
the new seams created by the shifting and saw something move in a
heavily damaged section.
   ``He couldn't believe what he was seeing, so he brought some
others who also detected movement,'' said Bob Jacobs, deputy
director at the California Department of Transportation.
   An all-out effort with jackhammers was begun. Two hours later,
Ms. Moore was able to get within eight feet and yell to Helm, who
moved his head.
   That was the first confirmation that he was alive.
   The crowd of rescuers cheered when told Helm was alive.
   ``We saw him wave his hand and everybody started cheering
again,'' said Seth Isler, a Los Angeles actor volunteering with the
Red Cross.
   ``It was an incredible site to see.''
   Helm was identified by his car's license plates and a check of
the list of missing people.
   There were no other survivors in nearby cars, but the search was
renewed after the discovery of Helm, officials said.
   ``There have been five sweeps of the entire structure, and we
are in the process of making a sixth sweep,'' Garver said.
   CalTrans spokesman Jim Drago said despite renewed enthusiasm for
the rescue operation, they effort can't be sped up for fear of
causing cave-ins.
   ``The problem is we still have to proceed cautiously and
deliberately even though our people are encouraged'' that others
might still be alive, Drago said.
   In San Francisco, firefighters removed what they first thought
was the body of a baby discovered Saturday in the smoldering
remains of a fire in the Marina district. The coronor's office
later said tests would have to determine if the remains were human.
   A search with trained dogs continued for others missing in the
blaze, which killed three people following the earthquake.
Bulldozers began demolishing the first half-dozen of about 60
dwellings in the Marina that were too badly damaged to be repaired.
   In hard-hit Santa Cruz, where the quake and its aftershocks
still have residents jittery, rain forced people inside for the
first time since Tuesday.
   ``Many of the families who had earlier been camped out in
backyards and parks because they didn't feel secure inside
buildings are making a value judgment and seeking getting out of
the weather,'' said Lee Duffuss of the local Red Cross office.
   Tents have sprung up all over town, he said, and federal
officials are trying to determine whether to create a long-term
tent city for those driven out of their homes.
   Officials said they began noticing increases in shelter
populations Saturday, and expected more Sunday as a second storm
was expected in the Bay area.
   High winds dashed engineers' hopes of quickly removing the
collapsed 50-foot section of the upper deck of the Bay Bridge, the
lifeline connecting Oakland and San Francisco.
   Experts decided to cut the 250-ton slab of five-lane highway
into two pieces with a giant saw and lower them to a barge with a
crane, said Greg Bayol of the California Department of
Transportation.
   The decision to delay the lifting is not expected to set back
the four-week target date for reopening the bridge, Bayol said.
   Rain also raised the threat of additional landslides in the
mountains north of Santa Cruz, near the epicenter of Tuesday's
6.9-magnitude quake. In Boulder Creek, a town of 6,800, 60 homes
already have been destroyed.
   County spokeswoman Dinah Phillips said not enough rain was
expected to cause widespread land problems.
   Relief aid continued to stream into the area. But the most
urgent requirement was for money to help relocate homeless families
from shelters to temporary living quarters such as hotels, a Red
Cross official said.
   About 5,000 people have been housed in 30 shelters in the region
affected by Tuesday's quake, the Red Cross said.
   Some 12,000 people _ 10,000 of them in Santa Cruz County _ have
been displaced from their homes, officials said.

   Police searched on Saturday for a Palestinian
suspected of strangling seven people in Tel Aviv, and the case has
prompted officials to review the policy that lets workers from the
occupied lands stay overnight in the city.
   Police said the murders apparently stemmed from financial
disputes between the suspect and his victims over drugs and
prostitution, but they would not rule out a political motive.
   Army radio quoted police officials as saying the suspect was
known as a criminal and was given an overnight permit because he
served as an informant for Israel's security forces. Tel Aviv
police declined comment.
   The victims included prostitutes and drug dealers. Some were
Jews and others were Arabs, including some from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The investigation began Friday when residents of an impoverished
Tel Aviv neighborhood reported bad odors coming from an apartment.
   Police arrived to discover the decomposing bodies of two women
and one man hidden under mattresses in the apartment.
   They said the investigation led them to the Arab-Jewish Tel Aviv
suburb of Jaffa, where the bodies of three women and one man were
found.
   News reports said police suspected more bodies may be found in
southern Tel Aviv.
   Assistant Inspector General Yigal Markus, the Tel Aviv police
chief, said the main suspect was a Palestinian from the occupied
territories who had a permit to stay in Tel Aviv at night.
   Israel army radio said the victims apparently were strangled
with nylon string.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss said Saturday the policy of
granting permits to Palestinian workers to spend the night in Tel
Aviv will be re-examined.
   ``Tel Aviv should not serve as a haven for criminals from the
(occupied) territories,'' he said.
   Thousands of Palestinian workers travel each morning to Tel Aviv
but need a special permit to stay the night. Many hide in
apartments, warehouses or shelters to avoid the journey back home
or the possibility of being caught in a Palestinian commercial
strike.
   Police officials have said they are instructed not to arrest
laborers staying in Tel Aviv illegally. However, measures have been
taken to limit the flow into Israel of suspected criminals and
activists of the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
rule of the territories.
   In June, the army began requiring that Palestinian workers from
the Gaza Strip present magnetic ID cards to enter Israel. Leaders
of the uprising have ordered strikes and attacks to protest the
step, but they appear to have lost the battle.
   In July, police gave the army a list of about 3,300 Palestinians
it wanted permanently barred from entering Israel because of
suspected criminal activity.

   The head of NBC News has criticized the
network's initial response to San Francisco's earthquake and
ordered executives to find out why NBC was late with its coverage.
   An internal memo issued Friday by NBC News President Michael
Gartner and made available by a source was written after the
network received complaints from affiliates.
   Although the network eventually broadcast non-stop coverage of
Tuesday's quake, it lagged far behind its rivals both in reports
and pictures.
   NBC's first live pictures from the scene didn't air until 9:08
p.m. EDT Tuesday, well after ABC, CBS and CNN were broadcasting
live shots.
   Gartner's memo blamed some of the delay in coverage on
``problems and confusion'' that were not related to technical
problems. NBC spokewoman Peggy Hubble confirmed Saturday that the
memo was by Gartner.
   Gartner had said in an interview Wednesday that the delay was
because NBC's San Francisco affiliate, KRON-TV, had been harder hit
by the earthquake than other network affiliates, and was knocked
off the air longer.
   However, Francis Martin, president of Chronicle Broadcasting,
which owns KRON, said in a letter Friday that the station was back
on the air by 8:35 p.m, 31 minutes after the earthquake.
   In a letter to James R. Sefert, chairman of NBC's affiliate
board, Martin said NBC could have had a satellite feed of pictures
from the scene then had it asked. It also could have gotten
pictures shortly after that via a KRON hookup with station KCRA-TV
in Sacramento, or from NBC-owned KNBC-TV in Burbank, Calif., Martin
wrote.
   By 8:50 p.m. EDT, Martin said, there were three ways NBC could
have picked up KRON's signal. Had it done so then, he said, that
would have made NBC ``second to ABC in terms of initial coverage
and would have made CBS third.''
   Gartner's memo began by praising news employees' hard work in
covering the quake, said an executive who requested anonymity. Then
it changed tone.
   ``Let me express my dismay and anger over our not being on the
air right away Tuesday night,'' Gartner wrote.
   ``We had problems and confusion that were not related to the
technical problems of getting material from our affiliate,'' he
said. ``This is just unacceptable. Period.''
   ``I don't think we have a workable procedure for dealing with
crises like this,'' the memo said, adding that there will be one
soon.
   He said he had asked a top NBC News executive to investigate
what happened and then ``quickly develop a failsafe procedure to
ensure that we're never again late in getting on the air.''

<HEAD>Soviet Soldiers Start Group to Fight Military Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 200 Soviet soldiers and seamen formed an
unsanctioned organization Saturday to fight military corruption and
ensure that ``the army is not used against the people,'' a group
spokeman said.
   The founding congress of Shchit, Russian for ``shield,'' went
ahead despite heavy opposition from military officials, spokesman
Dmitri Chechell said.
   He said the group wants to help soldiers and sailors battle
corruption in the armed forces and make sure the military is not
used as it was at Tbilisi in April, when soldiers charged
pro-independence protesters. Twenty people died in the unrest in
the city, the capital of Georgia.
   Chechell said many of the delegates to the congress left their
military units illegally to attend Saturday's meeting. He said some
were even placed under house arrest to prevent them from coming.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, KGB chairman Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov and other top officials were invited but failed to
appear, Chechell said.
   However, Communist Party gadfly Boris N. Yeltsin and other
progressive Soviet lawmakers did attend, he said.
   Shchit will fight ``arbitrariness, nepotism, corruption and
cover-ups,'' Chechell said.
   The group is calling for fewer top-ranking officers and limits
on dishonorable discharges, which are often used as ``revenge
against inconveniently honorable people,'' he said.
   He said organizers expect to encounter major opposition from
authorities when they try to officially register the new group as
an organization.
   The congress was scheduled to continue through Sunday.

   President Bush on Saturday kept his pledge to
veto legislation that would liberalize abortion law by making
federal funds available for poor women in cases of incest and rape.
   Bush said he was unwilling to expend tax dollars unless the
mother's life is endangered, which is the only way Medicaid can
fund abortions under current law.
   ``This year, regrettably, the Congress has expanded the
circumstances in which federal appropriated funds could be used to
pay for abortions,'' Bush said in a veto message released by the
White House.
   The Senate on Thursday completed action on the abortion
language, passing on a 67-31 vote a $156.7 billion fiscal 1990
spending bill for the departments of Health and Human Services,
Labor and Education that included the expanded abortion funding
provision despite Bush's threat of a veto.
   The House passed the measure the previous week by a much more
narrow margin, 216-206 _ far short of the two-thirds vote that
would be needed to override a veto.
   However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has indicated
he would make an override attempt. Foley and other Democrats say
they do not believe there will be sufficient votes.
   The leading sponsor of the abortion language change, Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has said supporters will attempt to attach
the language to other legislation.
   Congressional action to broaden the federal guidelines that have
covered abortions for Medicaid mothers since 1981 came amid
increased activism nationwide by pro-choice forces angered by the
Supreme Court's decision in July to allow state discretion on
abortion law.
   Pro-choice advocates had been buoyed by congressional passage of
the new abortion language and by the failure of Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez to get bills toughening that state's abortion laws through
a special session of the Florida legislature earlier this month.
   They expressed dismay Saturday over Bush's decision.
   ``With one stroke of his pen, President Bush today condemned
impoverished women to continue crisis pregnancies that can destroy
their lives,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, the political arm of the
pro-choice movement. She said Bush ``defied public opinion and
pandered to extremists.''
   But Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the pro-life
National Right to Life Committee, said ``Pesident Bush has acted to
protect innocent human life. Now pro-life Americans must persuade
the House of Representatives to back him up.''
   In his veto message, Bush said ``I have informed the Congress on
numerous occasions that I would veto legislation if it permitted
the use of appropriated funds to pay for abortions other than those
in which the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus
were carried to term.''
   He noted that he wrote to the Senate on Tuesday warning he would
veto such language.
   In his brief veto message, Bush said he also was unhappy that
the spending bill did not provide adequate funding for the Pell
grant program for higher education, and that it ``failed to provide
needed flexibility in the use of HHS discretionary funds to combat
HIV AIDs, one of America's highest public health priorities.''
   Bush had indicated last week he was willing to discuss
compromise language on abortion, but then made what some saw as a
concession to conservative Republicans.
   Supporters of the expanded guidelines said the president's
position discriminated unfairly against poor mothers. Bush supports
the practice of abortion in cases of rape or incest, as well as
when the mother's life is endangered, but he does not favor using
federal funds for the first two situations.
   He said in a news conference Oct. 13 that he was ``not looking
for any conflict over this'' and was interested in seeing if
conference language could be worked out by the House and Senate
that ``may be able to avoid a veto on my part.''
   Bush said when he wrote to the Senate last Tuesday that he had
not reached his position on abortion ``easily or lightly.''
   ``Since 1981, the federal government has determined, I think
wisely, that taxpayer funds should be used for abortion in only the
most narrow of circumstances: where the life of the mother is
endangered. If abortion funding were expanded to include other
circumstances, it would be difficult to limit to the few cases of
actual rape or incest, and could have the unintended consequence of
allowing the taking of countless other lives of unborn children
well beyond the few cased argued as reasons for the proposed
legislative change.''
   That letter came on the heels of what abortion proponents had
seen as a glimmer of hope for a shift in Bush's position. In his
Oct. 13 news conference he had said he wanted to ``see if there's
room for flexibility'' on the question in Congress.
   His veto means the entire $156.7 billion spending package goes
back to Congress.
   It is the third bill Bush has vetoed since he took office. In
June he vetoed legislation raising the minimum wage to $4.55 an
hour, and in July he vetoed a measure placing restrictions on a $6
billion program for the United States to build a new jet fighter,
the FSX, with Japan.

   President Bush's veto Saturday of legislation
allowing federally financed abortions for rape and incest victims
marks the third time since he took office that he has exercised
that constitutional prerogative.
   Bush said he vetoed the $156.7 billion health, education and
labor spending measure that included the abortion provision because
he opposed expanding the use of tax dollars for abortion.
   Current law makes federal Medicaid funds for abortion available
to poor women only when the mother's life is endangered.
   This summer the president vetoed a bill that effectively would
have killed a joint production agreement between the United States
and Japan for the FSX jet fighter.
   In June he also vetoed legislation that would have raised the
minimum wage to $4.55 an hour by October 1991.
   Congressional opponents of the fighter deal wanted to place
restrictions on the transfer of certain advanced U.S. technology to
the Japanese in the development of the $6 billion aircraft by
General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   Bush argued the restrictions were an infringement on
presidential powers to conduct foreign policy. The Senate last
month failed by a single vote to override the veto.
   Bush's first veto came after less than six months in office when
Congress approved an increase of the hourly minimum wage from $3.55
to $4.55. Bush had offered an increase to $4.25 an hour over a
longer period, with a six-month subminimum $3.40 an hour ``training
wage'' for new employees.
   Democrats initially resisted the subminimum wage but later
included a provision allowing the lower wage for first-time
employees with fewer than 60 days' work experience in the measure
Bush rejected.
   Neither the House nor Senate could muster the votes needed to
override that veto.
   Last week the Democratic-controlled House Labor and Education
Committee approved a new minimum wage bill with Bush's $4.25
ceiling, but the panel insisted the increase must come in two
45-cent increments by October 1991. It also retained the 60-day
limit on the lower wage.
   Senate sources have said the modified House bill could be
brought up within the next three weeks.

   The earthquake may turn out to be the most expensive natural
disaster in U.S. history, with state officials putting the current
estimate at $5.5 billion. The 1906 earthquake and fire in San
Francisco cost as much as $5.8 billion in current dollars,
according to the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
   The American Red Cross says at least 729 homes and residential
buildings were destroyed and 4,950 others damaged along 75 miles of
the San Andreas Fault. The state Office of Emergency Services said
6,568 people remained displaced Saturday, 4,500 in Santa Cruz
County.

   Stunned rescuers pulled a 57-year-old longshoreman alive from
the debris of I-880 Saturday, long after most had given up hope of
finding survivors. Buck Helm, the first person rescued alive since
Tuesday night, was rushed to a local hospital suffering a serious
chest injury but doctors said he was not in imminent danger.
   Fifty-five deaths have been confirmed, with the toll expected to
grow as more bodies are pulled out of the wreckage where I-880
collapsed. Officials said 34 bodies had been pulled from the I-880
rubble by Saturday, with dozens of missing people expected to be
counted among the victims; elsewhere in Northern California, at
least 21 people have been killed.
   The state OES reports that 3,011 people were injured in eight
counties of Northern California. Thirty Red Cross shelters were
housing up to 5,000 people Saturday.

<NOTE>THE QUAKE AND AFTERSHOCKS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, registered 6.9 on the
Richter scale, and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 14 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 57 miles south of San Francisco n the
Santa Cruz Mountains. Scientists pinpointed the epicenter in the
northeast corner of the Nisene Marks State Park, near the top of
Aptos Creek.
   More than 2,000 aftershocks have been recorded, including one of

   Tens of thousands of people left homeless by the
worst earthquake in northern China in more than a decade spent a
third night outdoors Saturday, and the government delivered
truckloads of food to devastated towns.
   ``The nighttime is unbearably cold,'' said Guan Xiaoping, a
peasant from Guiren Village. Like almost every person in the
village of 2,400, he lost his home in a series of severe tremors
Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
   Guiren was one of 40 villages, mostly in Shanxi province, that
were severely damaged by the quakes. They killed at least 29
people, injured more than 150, destroyed an estimated 27,500 homes
and left more than 50,000 homeless.
   Guan told a Western reporter he had received noodles, bread,
clothing and millet from the government. He also said soldiers had
helped him build a temporary wood-and-mud shelter.
   But he said there had been no promises of help in rebuilding his
home. ``For winter we will build stronger tents. We have no
choice,'' he said.
   The national television news, in its first extensive reporting
on the disaster, Saturday night showed truckloads of food being
delivered. It said local officials and the People's Liberation Army
were involved in relief operations.
   People wearing many layers of clothing to ward off the cold and
wind warmed themselves around fires and slept in hastily built
shelters of straw and bamboo.
   At least one aftershock strong enough to be felt jolted the area
Saturday morning. Beijing Radio, in a broadcast monitored in Tokyo,
said Saturday there have been about 1,500 aftershocks, four between
5.0 and 6.0 on the Richter scale.
   The biggest quakes late Wednesday and early Thursday measured
5.7 and 6.1 on the Richter scale, which measures ground motion. A
quake measuring 6.0 can cause severe damage in a populated area.
   The Communist Party's People's Daily said Saturday that 40
villages in a 320-square-mile area were damaged. The epicenter of
one quake was 135 miles west of Beijing.
   The newspaper said 1,600 soldiers had been mobilized to help in
relief operations and that such items as bread, noodles,
chopsticks, quilts, tents, mats and medical supplies had been
rushed to the affected areas.
   Chinese seismologists said the quakes were the worst to hit
northern China since 1976. That year, a quake measuring at least
7.8 on the Richter scale killed 240,000 people in the northeastern
city of Tangshan.

   About three dozen parachutists leaped
off the country's second tallest bridge Saturday in defiance of
official warnings that flooding made the jump too dangerous on the
one day a year it is allowed.
   No injuries were reported. Police cited at least one of the
parachutists who jumped from the 876-foot New River Gorge National
Bridge.
   The National Park Service, the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce,
and a group organizing the jump as part of the 10th annual Bridge
Day celebration called off the jump Saturday morning, saying the
river, which was running 11{ feet above normal, had flooded all
safe landing sites.
   Authorities did not set another date for the jump because they
could not predict when water would subside. Parachutists had
traveled from as far away as Europe and Australia and 100,000
spectators had gathered.
   Last year, more than 100,000 people turned out to watch 300
divers perform 600 jumps from the center of the bridge.
   ``I didn't come here to spin doughnuts,'' said Gerald Harendza,
30, before making the 8-second leap. ``It's not dangerous.''
   Harendza, a construction worker from Lordsville, N.Y., who has
performed 135 jumps off buildings, antennas, bridges and cliffs
since 1982, landed on a pathway at the bottom of the
3,000-foot-wide gorge.
   Nunzio Forte, a 59-year-old father of six who had never jumped
off a structure before, landed on railroad tracks after hitting a
tree.
   ``I have six kids _ sure I'm worried,'' Forte, a carpenter from
Effort, Pa., said before jumping. ``It's a little risky, but I'm
going to try it. I've been wanting to do this for my birthday.''
   The morning's third jumper yelled ``Skydive Wyoming!'' as he
leaped over the edge of the bridge. Timothy Sell, 23, of Davis,
Calif., landed in a parking lot, and was cited for parachuting onto
federal property without a permit.
   Sell said it was his sixth jump from the bridge.
   ``I think it's unfair. I come out here from California and I get
this,'' said Sell, who said he didn't consider the jump dangerous
for veterans.
   The offense carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail,
$5,000 in fines and confiscation of equipment, police said.
   The area under the bridge includes state, federal and private
land, giving jurisdiction to different law enforcement agencies.
   Damien Hansen, 24, a parachute rigger from Melbourne, Australia,
opted not to jump.
   ``It was a wise move, all in all,'' Hansen said. ``We came all
the way from Australia, but we're happy. It'll be here next year.''
   About two dozen parachutists made their jumps in late afternoon
as authorities were preparing to clear the bridge of thousands of
spectators.
   ``One sheriff's guy came on the P.A. and said, `let's clear the
bridge,''' one diver said later. ``I said, `OK, see you later,'''
and leaped.
   Unlike earlier divers who landed on the north side of the river,
later divers zeroed in on a clearing on a twisting road amid about
150 dodging, cheering spectators on the south side of the river.
One diver landed on the roof of a car, another was left dangling in
a tree and a third brushed a tree before falling in a pile of
leaves.
   The river has to be running, at most, at 4 feet above normal to
permit jumping on Bridge Day, said Lizzie Watts, a park service
ranger. The water level fell only 2{ feet from its level of 14 feet
above normal Friday night, despite the opening by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers of four floodgates.
   Three people have been killed in parachute leaps from the
bridge, two during Bridge Day festivities. The last fatality
occurred in 1987. No prior jumps were canceled.
   Other Bridge Day festivities went on as scheduled, including
arts and crafts sales and the detouring of traffic so that
pedestrians could walk on the world's longest steel arch bridge and
view the fall foliage.
   The only taller bridge in the United States is the Royal Gorge
Bridge over the Arkansas River in Colorado.

<TEXT>
   Buck Alvin Helm, a beefy longshoreman who
splits his time between the Oakland waterfront and the Klamath
Mountains, is ``strong, tough and ornery.'' Those traits served him
well in a death-defying, 90-hour ordeal on a crumpled highway.
   Helm's family and friends know him as an occasionally
cantankerous, family-loving man with a booming voice who knows how
to survive. And survive he did through three nights of terrifying
conditions inside his crushed car in the concrete wreckage of the
Nimitz Freeway.
   Asked what kept his father alive so long, Greg Helm responded:
``He's an ornery old fart.''
   Helm, 57, has worked in the bay area since 1969 as a shipping
clerk for Local 34 of the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union. A former teacher, he has worked most recently
at the Port of Oakland, keeping track of the cargo received and
delivered on the waterfront.
   Most weekends and sometimes on weekdays, he drives 250 miles
north to Weaverville on the edge of the Klamath Mountains to visit
his children and his ex-wife, with whom he remains good friends.
His silver Chevrolet Sprint, mashed in the wreckage, had nearly
200,000 miles on it.
   News of his miraculous survival and rescue shot through the town
of 3,500 like a lightning bolt Saturday.
   One woman came into Top's Market where Buck shops, the largest
grocery store in town, and hollered at the top of her lungs, ``They
found him! They found him!'', according to assistant manager Tony
Giassullo.
   A group of Helm's friends and relatives was watching television
together at the home of his ex-wife, Lorene, when news came that he
was alive.
   ``Everyone was happy, yelling, crying and holding each other,''
said Frank Desmond, a friend of Helm's son Jeff. ``Mrs. Helm was
saying, `Thank God!'''
   Said former next-to-door neighbor Cathy Hardisty: ``I still got
chills all over my body at him living through that.''
   Helm's tale of survival starts with his own misfortune in timing.
   After finishing up work at 5 p.m., Helm and Basil Parker, a
co-worker for the last six years, left the Howard Terminal and
headed north on the Nimitz, Parker for his home in Berkeley and
Helm for Weaverville. Seconds after passing Helm and waving to him,
Parker looked in his rear-view mirror as the earthquake struck;
Helm, who had been about 10 car lengths behind him, was gone.
   ``Right now, all I can say is I'm glad to see him alive,'' said
Parker. ``I'm happy for his family more than anything.''
   Helm, described by one acquaintance as about 6 feet tall, 240
pounds and ``pretty good-sized around the middle,'' is a well-known
figure in Weaverville. His family has lived there about 10 years _
sons Greg, by a first marriage, and Jeff, a high school student,
and fifth-grader Desiree.
   ``He was a real family man,'' said Bridgitte Calkins. ``We saw
him when he went to the football games and the soccer games with
his children. He's real friendly and real talkative.''
   Waitress Lory Hartland, 25, serves him cherry pie and coffee
almost every weekend at the Nugget Restaurant.
   ``He's big, strong, tough and ornery,'' she said. ``I'm not
surprised he survived. He always comes in here with all his kids
and their friends. He's a real good dad. I'm ecstatic he's alive.''
   So is Weaverville resident Fred Meyer, who described his friend
as ``a big bear of a guy.''
   ``He has a booming voice and a heart of gold,'' Meyer said.
   
   Peggy McConnell of Weaverville said Helm is one of her best
friends. She said he ``stands out as an individualist in this
fundamentalist, redneck little town.''
   McConnell, 40, described Helm's car as dirty and disorganized
and said it might have contained food and water. She said he had
access to a van that he slept in while in the Bay area in order to
save money, ``even though he makes plenty of money.''
   
   The day after the 6.9 quake, Helm's former wife walked into
Weaverville Variety Office Supply in a daze and spoke with store
owner Pat Zugg.
   ``She said she had a gut feeling that he was trapped in that
freeway,'' she said. ``She was pretty stunned. He hadn't called to
say he was OK, so she knew something wasn't right. He was very
family-oriented. Every time I saw him he was with his kids.''
   Helm's co-workers on the waterfront had known for days that he
was almost surely among the victims on the devastated stretch of
freeway. When radio and television reported he had been found, many
called in to the Local 34 office to share the good news.
   ``We're all ecstatic,'' said Dave Comport, a shipping
superintendent who works in the same terminal as Helm. ``We figured
that if anybody could make it, Buck Helm could. He's tough. He's a
fighter.''
   Frances Lona, secretary for the Local 34 main office in San
Francisco, characterized Helm and his co-workers as ``wild
characters,'' but said he is a great guy.
   He's now a guy with a new nickname, according to co-worker Bob
Bombarde.
   ``We're going to call him Lucky Bucky from now on,'' Bombarde
said.

<TEXT>
   Local transit officials are pleading with
commuters to stay off the roads Monday, the first business day for
tens of thousands since the quake damaged the Bay Bridge.
   In a plan put together by area transportation agencies,
commuters were asked to instead make use of subways, trains, buses
or ferries.
   The plan was hastily thrown together in an effort to avoid what
promises to be the worst traffic mess ever experienced here as
55,000 people who usually drive over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge try other routes. An additional 10,000 people who normally
commute by bus will also need to find other routes.
   ``We have a very critical situation,'' Birch Buchtold, district
director for the state Department of Transportation, said Saturday.
   The 8-mile-long Bay Bridge, which lost a 50-foot section of its
top deck in Tuesday's earthquake, is a key link between San
Francisco and Oakland.
   But the transit problems are not limited to the bridge. The
Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco is closed because of
structural failure and the Interstate 280 extension from downtown
to Highway 101 near Candlestick Park is also down for several
months.
   In Oakland, the Cypress section of Interstate 880, used by
160,000 cars daily, has been closed after a section collapsed,
killing dozens.
   State Highway 17, a vital link for 20,000 people who commute to
work in the Silicon Valley, is closed in Santa Cruz because of
landslides connected to Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude temblor.

   About 750 blacks and supporters angry about
``acts of racist violence'' staged a peaceful, three-mile march
Saturday through the predominantly white neighborhood where Mayor
Richard M. Daley lives.
   ``No part of this city is off limits to people of my race,''
Alderman Allan Streeter, who is black, said at a rally at a South
Side church where politicians, clergy and civil rights leaders gave
marching orders to the group.
   ``We're here to say to Chicagoans we're not going to be afraid
anywhere in this city,'' the Rev. Benjamin Chavis Jr. told the
marchers. ``We must not let acts of racist violence in Chicago
continue without a national protest.''
   Police said the march was orderly and no arrests were made.
   Most whites who lined the streets or sat on the stoops of their
bungalow-style homes were silent or talked among themselves. A few,
however, taunted the marchers.
   ``White power! Go home, niggers!'' yelled Karen Carter, 19, a
resident of the Canaryville neighborhood. ``They take our houses,
want to burn our houses down. I feel like shooting them.''
   But neighbor Tom Millard, 39, said blacks walk through the
district daily without problems.
   ``They're free to go anywhere they want,'' he said. ``For two
decades we've had this name, racism and all that. We're just
working class people who want to keep living here and want to be
left alone.''
   The protests were sparked by recent incidents of alleged police
brutality and by the growing belief that Daley _ who lives in the
neighborhood _ has not done enough to stop such incidents.
   In one case, two black youths said they were roughed up by white
police officers who picked them up for a curfew violation after a
White Sox baseball game in nearby Comiskey Park. The boys, Calvin
McLin and Joe Weaver, say they then were attacked by a gang of
white youths.
   The officers were charged with official misconduct and battery
and have been suspended without pay. McLin and Weaver helped lead
the march past the corner where they were attacked, and past
Daley's house. The mayor did not appear to be at home.
   ``We didn't come today to destroy anybody's community,'' said
Jesse Jackson Jr., son of the civil rights leader. ``We're here
today to declare Chicago a free and open city.''

   Flight controllers told the Atlantis
astronauts Saturday they will have to return to Earth at least 90
minutes early Monday to avoid predicted high afternoon winds at the
California landing site.
   Officials also said they were preserving an option, outlined
Friday, of keeping the space shuttle in orbit an extra day or two
if a landing can't be made Monday. A three-day extension was
possible, but not likely, they said.
   Meanwhile, astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, a naturalized U.S.
citizen who was born in San Jose, Costa Rica, spoke from orbit
Saturday evening with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   Arias praised Chang-Diaz for his accomplishments, saying he had
``become an example to the young people of Costa Rica and of Latin
America in general.''
   To conserve power for a possible prolonged mission, the
astronauts turned off unneeded lights and shut off some computers
and other redundant equipment.
   They were directed Saturday to adjust their work and sleep
schedules to be ready to return at least 90 minutes, or one orbit,
early on Monday. Bedtime was 90 minutes early Saturday and about 2{
hours early Sunday.
   Since the forecast calls for gusts up to 35 mph at Edwards Air
Force Base at the planned 12:38 p.m. PDT landing time on Monday,
NASA decided to land a little earlier because winds at the Mojave
Desert base normally are lighter in the morning, flight director
Ron Dittemore said Saturday afternoon.
   The new landing time is now 11:08 a.m. Monday at Edwards,
Dittemore said.
   If the winds look as if they will still be too strong, the
shuttle could land another 90 minutes earlier Monday, he added.
Flight controllers will reevaluate the landing time after a weather
briefing Sunday morning, he added.
   ``We're just going to have to watch the winds real closely,''
Dittemore said.
   For safety reasons, a shuttle would not land if a crosswind
exceeded 18 mph or a headwind was more than 29 mph.
   The crew consists of commander Don Williams, pilot Mike
McCulley, and mission specialists Chang-Diaz, Shannon Lucid and
Ellen Baker.
   Chang-Diaz, a physicist, discussed the flight with the Costa
Rican president in Spanish, saying, ``It has been a marvelous
mission.'' He also said the crew had taken several photographs of
Costa Rica and he hoped to show them to Arias after the mission.
   ``We feel exceedingly proud of everything you have accomplished.
In reality, you raise high the name of Costa Rica and of Latin
America in general,'' Arias told Chang-Diaz, who has been a hero in
his homeland since his first trip to space in 1986.
   Arias invited the crew members to a space conference next March.
   ``I don't have words to thank, on behalf of our people, all of
you for what you are doing for the welfare of humankind,'' Arias
said.
   Earlier Saturday, Flight director Bob Castle reported Atlantis
``is humming right along. It's a very clean vehicle.''
   The Galileo spacecraft the astronauts released six hours after
launching on Wednesday was more than 600,000 miles from Earth on
Saturday and ``doing wonderfully,'' reported mission director Neil
Ausman. He said the craft had measured radiation from a large solar
flare that erupted on the sun Thursday but its computer memory was
not affected by the large dose.
   The $1.5 billion Galileo is traveling a 2.4-billion-mile course
that is to carry it into orbit about the giant planet in December
1995. Once there it is to fire an instrument package into the
atmosphere and probe Jovian mysteries for 22 months.
   In honor of the Jupiter probe, the music that flight controllers
chose to radio to the shuttle Saturday morning as a wake-up call
was the rock song ``Bohemian Rhapsody'' by the group Queen. The
lyrics mention Galileo.
   The astronauts' camera targets Saturday included a dust storm in
Africa's Sahara Desert, volcanoes in Mexico and the Philippines,
Mexican and Turkish river deltas, Typhoon Elsie in the South China
Sea, a storm south of Bermuda and damage done by Hurricane Hugo to
barrier islands off the South Carolina coast. Crew members are
filming sights for a documentary about Earth.
   Should bad weather persist at Edwards, the shuttle has two
alternative sites. The Northrup Strip at White Sands Missile Range,
N.M., would be the first choice, and Kennedy Space Center in
Florida the second.
   Atlantis has enough fuel, oxygen, power and other supplies to
remain in orbit two days beyond the planned five-day mission
without any conservation efforts.

   Federal relief officials, under criticism
for responding sluggishly after Hurricane Hugo, said Saturday that
disaster-aid centers will open Sunday in seven earthquake-ravaged
counties.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has processed 4,050
applications over a 24-hour hotline since Thursday, a day after
President Bush issued a disaster declaration for parts of northern
California.
   But those who lost their homes in one of the nation's costliest
natural disasters should expect to wait seven to 10 days for a
check to pay for temporary housing once their applications are
processed and verified.
   ``There is no magic wand,'' said FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan.
``People have to understand that FEMA does not have people standing
by waiting for disasters to happen. It takes us a little time to
get rolling and do it right.''
   Until federal money is approved, those displaced can seek
emergency shelter with the Red Cross or pay for a hotel and seek
reimbursement from the government, FEMA said.
   Centers will be open from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday in San
Francisco and the counties of Alameda, Monterey, San Benito, Santa
Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo. Hours will be 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
thereafter.
   Local officials pleaded for quick government help, and President
Bush pledged ``no red tape'' when he toured the area Friday.
   ``We need fast action. We need checks written on the spot,''
said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.
   But FEMA officials warned that residents should not have
unrealistic expectations.
   ``Our program is really a federal assistance program. It is not
an insurance program funded by the government to make their lives
whole,'' said Tom Hamner, the federal coordinating officer.
   U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said the state
delegation would ask Congress for a $3.3 billion funding package on
Monday to help the area recover, including $1.1 billion for FEMA.
   After Hurricane Hugo slammed South Carolina on Sept. 21, it took
FEMA seven days to open its first disaster center. U.S. Sen. Fritz
Hollings, D-S.C., called FEMA officials ``a bunch of bureaucratic
jackasses'' for the slowness of their response.
   Areas in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and North and South
Carolina are still under disaster declarations because of Hurricane
Hugo.
   In addition to money for temporary housing, the government can
provide low interest loans, cash grants of up to $10,400 for
individuals, jobless pay for those not covered by unemployment
insurance and advice on how to claim losses on their federal tax
returns.

   Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., paid a $50 fine to
release his wife from jail in the District of Columbia on Saturday
after she was arrested for driving with an expired license, police
officials said.
   Dorothy Ford was stopped after she allegedly ran a red light
near the Capitol building Saturday morning, police said.
   When an officer discovered her driver's license had expired more
than a year ago, Mrs. Ford was arrested and taken to a nearby
police station, where she called her husband, police said.
   A police official said anyone caught driving with a license more
than 90 days out of date is subject to the $50 fine, which must be
paid when the infraction is discovered.
   She still faces a $75 fine for allegedly running the traffic
signal.
   The seven-term congressman was himself indicted two years ago in
connection with loans allegedly illegally negotiated through banks
run by deposed Knoxville, Tenn., bankers Jake Butcher and C.H.
Butcher Jr.
   Ford's trial is set for Feb. 12.

   Animal rights activists in Ohio, Kentucky, Maryland and
Minnesota staged protests at department stores Saturday against the
sale of furs.
   Pickets stood outside Lazarus department stores in Columbus,
Ohio, Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky., handing out fliers and copies
of a letter from Lazarus officials declining to take a stand.
   A protest was also held at Higbee's stores in Cleveland and at a
Hutzler's in Baltimore. Two Minneapolis stores _ a Saks Fifth
Avenue and a Dayton-Hudson Corp. outlet _ were also the target of
demonstrators.
   In Columbus, Robin Russell, head of the group Protect Our
Earth's Treasures, suggested the stores could sell fake furs and
still satisfy their customers.
   ``What we found out was that this Lazarus had taken their furs
out a couple months ago because of low sales,'' Russell said. ``But
that reinforces what we are asking even more: Furs are not a large
part of their sales, and it's not going to hurt Lazarus to take the
furs out of their stores.''
   The demonstrators passed out a flier showing a copy of a letter
Daniel G. Bukey, Lazarus' vice president for consumer relations,
wrote to an animal rights group. He said the company ``found it
impractical to make moral, religious and political judgments about
products or the companies that manufacture them. We simply must buy
and sell the merchandise on the merit of the merchandise itself.''

   Federal relief officials, under criticism
for responding sluggishly after Hurricane Hugo, said Saturday that
disaster-aid centers will open Sunday in seven earthquake-ravaged
counties.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has processed 4,050
applications over a 24-hour hotline since Thursday, a day after
President Bush issued a disaster declaration for parts of northern
California.
   But those who lost their homes in one of the nation's costliest
natural disasters should expect to wait seven to 10 days for a
check to pay for temporary housing once their applications are
processed and verified.
   ``There is no magic wand,'' said FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan.
``People have to understand that FEMA does not have people standing
by waiting for disasters to happen. It takes us a little time to
get rolling and do it right.''
   Until federal money is approved, those displaced can seek
emergency shelter with the Red Cross or pay for a hotel and seek
reimbursement from the government, FEMA said.
   Centers will be open from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday in San

Helm was buried by an earthquake.
   ``Barbara and I join all Americans in expressing our joy in the

a tribute to the thousands of relief workers and volunteers who
have been working so tirelessly in the Bay Area. I am delighted to

   Alfred Hayes, the former president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, died Saturday at his home. He
was 79.
   Hayes suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease
and had been in a nursing home for about four years, said Richard
Hoenig, a spokesman for the bank.
   Hayes was educated at Harvard and Yale universities. He returned
to New York City in 1933 after a year in England as a Rhodes
scholar and started working in the bond department at the National
City Bank of New York, which later became Citibank.
   In 1956, he was appointed to the Federal Reserve and served
there until 1975. During the same period, he was vice chairman of
the Federal Open Market Committee.

<HEAD>More Parts Found in Farm Fields, GE Says Searches Will End Sunday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTA, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Volunteers searching northwest Iowa farm
fields Saturday found more parts from an engine of a DC-10 that
crashed July 19, but the key part has failed to turn up,
authorities said.
   The search by 90 volunteers, paid for by General Electric
Aircraft Engines, was to be discontinued Sunday, but rewards still
will be given for significant discoveries.
   Jerry Clark, a GE representative, said search parties using
metal detectors would try one last time to find a flange that
connected the forward fan shaft to the disc in the tail-mounted GE
engine and was held together with 20 bolts.
   The No. 2 engine flew apart as United Flight 232 was flying
north of Alta, spewing metal and severing hydraulic lines for
flight controls. Pilots wrestled the jumbo jet to the Sioux Gateway
Airport in Sioux City but the plane cartwheeled down the runway in
a fiery crash that killed 112 of the 296 people aboard.
   Of the engine pieces still missing, Clark said the flange is the
``thing most important'' to investigators.
   Nick Droegmiller, a farmer near Alta, said volunteers scoured
the fields on his land and found a variety of fragments.
   ``They came up with a couple of retainer pins and an oil line
with what looked like a pump on the end of it,'' he said. Searchers
said it was apparently part of the hydraulic system of the DC-10.
   The company has offered more than $270,000 in rewards for the
return of various parts.
   The largest single award of $119,000 was claimed this month when
Droegmiller's neighbor, farmer Janice Sorenson, found most of the
rear engine fan disc. The rest of the disc was found on the nearby
farm of Harold Halverson, who received about $40,000.

<HEAD>Hungarian Official Wants Soviet Forces Out; Trade With West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's foreign minister on Saturday said
Soviet forces should quickly leave his country and that Hungary may
someday join the European Economic Community.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, on a two-day official visit to
Norway, Friday discussed historic reforms in his East bloc nation
with Norway's prime minister, Jan P. Syse. On Saturday, he met with
Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
   ``As soon as possible, Soviet forces should be pulled out of
Hungarian territory. It depends on the success of talks in Vienna
in 1990 about conventional disarmament ... which should give the
green light to the withdrawal,'' Horn said at a news conference.
   About 62,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in Hungary. The
Soviets have pledged to pull out 10,000 of them by the end of next
year as part of a withdrawal from Eastern Europe.
   Horn also proposed a draft agreement of cooperation with the
six-nation European Free Trade Association to pave the way for
future Hungarian membership.
   He said Hungary may join Western European nations in the
European Economic Community in 10 to 15 years. The EEC, which is
promoting a common European market by 1992, now has 12 members.
   Meanwhile, Horn said, it would be more realistic for Hungary to
seek cooperation with the trade association.
   He said economic reform and trade are as important to
debt-ridden Hungary as political reform. He said the West must help
bolster Hungary's economy.
   ``Development of a political system is something that Hungary
itself decides. Economic development depends on our will and the
West's will,'' he said.
   Hungary this month rewrote its constitution to reflect
democratic ideals, allowing opposition parties and preparing for
its first free elections in 41 years. The elections are to be held
early next year.
   The Communist Party also dissolved itself and formed the
Hungarian Socialist Party, which is headed by reformers.
   ``Hungary is beginning to near the democracy of Western
Europe,'' Horn said. He predicted that the new party, which now
rules the country, will be part of a governing coalition after
multiparty elections.

   A deputy sheriff who fatally shot his
girlfriend was given a suspended sentence by a judge who said that
``sometimes the commission of the crime is the punishment itself.''
   Alexander G. Costeines, 21, of Shelton, who had been charged
with first-degree manslaughter, bowed his head and sobbed during
the proceedings before Judge Joseph T. Gormley Jr.
   New Haven police charged Costeines, a deputy sheriff in
Bridgeport, hours after the June 3 shooting.
   Costeines and Luanne Dietz, 19, had been sitting in her car that
night when the gun went off. Police and prosecutors said they
believed the shooting was accidental, but also believed Costeines
had lied about some of the details.
   During the trial, Miss Dietz's mother, Mary E. LaMere, told the
judge that nothing would be gained by sending Costeines to prison.
   ``I expect Alex to be accountable for what happened,'' LaMere
said, ``but I don't expect him to be persecuted for something that
didn't happen that way. He was negligent, yes. Did he intend to
hurt her? No.''
   The judge agreed.
   ``Sometimes the commission of the crime is the punishment
itself,'' Gormley said. ``I think in this case, that's absolutely
true.''
   Gormley prohibited Costeines from carrying a weapon for the five
years he will be on probation.
   The gun used in the shooting was Costeines' service revolver.

   Samuel Clarence Pulitzer, who grew up in an

Friday. He was 84.
   Pulitzer was chief executive officer of WEMCO Inc., a
multimillion-dollar neckwear and sportswear company which makes

   Pulitzer, who came from a New Orleans family with 11 children,
was placed in the orphanage when he was 6.
   He and his brother, the late Emanuel S. Pulitzer, began working
together in 1925, driving back roads from Texas to Alabama to sell
neckties. Their rise to riches began in 1936, when Samuel Pulitzer
cut up the jacket of his brother's new suit to make a necktie. The
suit was made from a wrinkle-resistant fabric made in England. Ties
made from the cloth quickly became popular.

   Americans sent planeloads of Pampers, shovels, stoves and other
basic goods to help quake victims rebuild their lives from the
ground up, and relief groups begged for cash to defray what could
prove the costliest U.S. natural disaster.
   Money was donated in every denomination, from children's pennies
to $1 million-plus corporate checks. In quake-conscious Japan,
companies, citizens' groups and local governments pledged hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
   ``The response to the need has been phenomenal,'' Capt. Don
McDougald of the Salvation Army in San Francisco said Saturday.
   ``We are finding material coming from all over the country.
Phoenix has sent six planeloads. States like Texas, Oregon and
Colorado have sent clothing, canned goods and tents of all kinds.''
   In some hard-hit communities near the quake's epicenter, like
Santa Cruz and Watsonville, residents were reduced to a
frontier-like existence, living on donated camping equipment,
cooking stoves and Sterno fuel, McDougald said.
   ``One of the things asked for is pet food. Up in the Santa Cruz
mountains these people keep all kinds of animals,'' McDougald said.
``We also need personal items like toothpaste, brushes and
deodorant.''
   Wet weather Saturday drove more of the newly homeless into some
of the 20 Red Cross shelters housing about 5,000 quake-displaced
people in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``Our main needs are for cash donations rather than donations of
food or clothing,'' said Red Cross spokesman Bob Howard in Los
Angeles. Most of the money will be used immediately to relocate the
homeless into temporary living quarters, officials said.
   ``With the rain over the next couple of days, people that have
been living outside their homes are going to need to come inside,
so we expect the shelter population to go up considerably,'' Howard
said.
   Since the quake struck Tuesday, the Red Cross alone has received
more than $8 million from individuals and from corporations, many
of them multinationals with ties to the Bay area.
   In quake-sensitive Southern California, people waited in line
for hours to give blood, and former President Reagan phoned in a
$5,000 donation to the Red Cross and recorded a public service
announcement before leaving on his $2 million junket to Japan.
   Orange County schools contributed more than $7,000 to
earthquake-relief efforts, most raised by students and teachers
passing the hat.
   First- and second-graders at Tierra Vista School in Oxnard
decided that the $60 they raised in a recycling drive for crayons,
felt pens and chalk for their classrooms should go to the Red Cross
for earthquake relief.
   Fullerton-based HomeClub Inc., a chain of home improvement
stores, donated about 200 shovels, 600 trash cans and 2,500 canvas
gloves to the Salvation Army.
   Elsewhere around the country, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch
Inc., as part of a $2 million donation, sent a trailer-load of
casual wear, including sweatsuits and light jackets. Transportation
was provided free by Union Pacific railroad. Johnson &amp; Johnson
Inc., based in New Brunswick, N.J., shipped in caseloads of
Pampers, the Red Cross said.
   In Montgomery, Ala., the Alabama Baptist State Convention on
Saturday dispatched a disaster relief truck _ actually a giant
kitchen on wheels _ to Santa Cruz, where it is expected to feed up
to 5,000 people a day.
   In Provo, Utah, fans at a football game between Brigham Young
University and the University of Texas-El Paso poured $60,301 into
collection boxes set up for earthquake relief donations to the Red
Cross. That included $20,000 from Joe Cannon, president of Geneva
Steel, who once worked for a steel plant in the San Francisco Bay
area.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. announced Saturday that it is providing
free shipping from seven Western states for emergency relief
supplies being collected by the Salvation Army and American Red
Cross.
   In Japan, where memories of the 1923 earthquake that destroyed
Tokyo are still vivid, the California temblor has aroused
widespread sympathy. Sumitomo Bank and Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S.
subsidiary each said it was donating $500,000.
   The city of Tokyo sent $15,000 each to San Francisco and
Oakland, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Friday. In
addition, U.S. Kawasaki Motors donated $50,000 in power-generating
equipment.
   Damage estimates for the quake stood at $5.5 billion Saturday
and, by one estimate, could go as high as $10 billion. That would
make it the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history with
the possible exception of San Francisco's 1906 quake, according to
the Independent Insurance Agents of America, a trade group based in
Washington.

   A Honduran jet carrying 146 people
broke apart in the air and crashed in flames into a mountain
Saturday as it prepared to land, and at least 131 people were
killed, officials said.
   Twenty survivors were initially rescued and scores more were
trapped in the burning wreckage, according to Red Cross volunteers
and firefighters. However, Raul Bonilla, general manager of
TAN-SAHSA airline, said later in the day that only 15 people had
been confirmed as survivors. He said 131 people had been confirmed
dead.
   A partial list provided by TAN-SAHSA showed that at least 11
Americans were on board the jet, which stopped in Nicaragua en
route from Costa Rica to Honduras.
   However, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Jacobs said about 20
Americans were on board.
   Bonilla said three Americans had survived. He identified two of
them as Eugene Van Dicke and Curtis Shaffer, but he had no
hometowns. He said an American woman had also survived, but she was
unconscious and officials had not determined her identity.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately reported. Honduran
officials said it was the nation's worst air disaster.
   The pilot, Raul Argueta, survived with serious bruises and
burns. His relatives said he told them he tried to land the plane
on a small soccer field near Las Mesitas, about 25 miles south of
Tegucigalpa. They did not say why he attempted an emergency landing.
   ``After exhaustively analyzing the situation, we can be sure
that a total of 146 people were aboard the plane,'' Bonilla said
late Saturday. He said there were 138 passengers and eight crew
members.
   Earlier, the airline had said 164 people were aboard. Nicaraguan
officials said at least 65 Nicaraguans were aboard.
   Tegucigalpa morgue director Edgardo Murillo said the dead
included Honduran Labor Minister Armando Blanco Paniagua; Jose
Ricardo Fasquell, chairman of Honduras' College of Forestry
Engineers; and Fanny Sanchez, a daughter of Defense Minister Col.
Wilfredo Sanchez.
   Also killed was Mario Rodriguez Cubero, an official in the Costa
Rican president's office, that country's embassy said.
   Rosario Ubeda, one of the few survivors able to talk to
reporters, said she remembered almost nothing of the crash. ``I
heard strange noises and shouting. I remember nothing (after
that),'' she said.
   Ms. Ubeda, a 40-year-old Nicaraguan, was interviewed at the
Medical School Hospital in Tegucigalpa. A doctor said she was in
serious condition with fractures of the pelvis, both legs, and an
arm.
   ``What we're seeing here is tremendous ... a really hellish
scene,'' said Rolando Sarmiento, a reporter for Radio HRN. ``It's a
horrible scene. The bodies are all over the place. There are at
least 15 bodies completely charred.''
   The TAN-SAHSA airlines Boeing 727-200 crashed into a 6,000-foot
peak called Cerro Hules at 7:45 a.m. in Las Tablitas, said Gen.
Humberto Regalado Hernandez, the armed forces chief.
   Control tower employees at Toncontin Airport in Tegucigalpa said
unusually strong winds were blowing as Flight No. 414 tried to land.
   A resident of Las Tablitas said the plane was on fire before it
hit the ground.
   ``I saw the plane coming down in flames ... and then I heard a
loud noise in the distance,'' the witness, Pedro Martinez, told
Radio HRN.
   Maj. Alejandro Arguello, the Nicaraguan civil aeronautics chief,
said ``Apparently part of the fuselage, the roof of the plane, tore
off.''
   Bonilla said the plane's ``black box'' flight recorder had been
located. He said officials from the International Aviation
Organization would open it Sunday ``and find out what really
happened.''
   The worst previous airplane disaster in Honduras occurred in
1987, when 60 people died in the crash of a Honduran air force
Hercules C-130.
   A partial passenger list provided by Alfonso Valladares, the
TAN-SAHSA reservation manager, included among the Americans on
board: Robert Heyr, Marie Apodaca, Edward Apodaca, Connie
Montealegre, Daniel Yurista, Tony Friedrich, Lea Browning, A.
Absevans and Gregory Pagla. It provided no hometowns.
   Arguello, speaking at a news conference in Managua, said he was
told that Pagla was an American diplomat.
   Lou Falino, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Managua, could
not confirm that.
   Red Cross workers said most of the people rescued suffered
serious burns.
   Radio stations broadcast bulletins from hospitals urgently
asking for donations of morphine, pain killers, antibiotics and
other medicines.
   The plane was on a regular run from San Jose, the capital of
Costa Rica, to Toncontin Airport with a stop in Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital.
   Honduras and Nicaragua declared periods of national mourning. In
Managua, officials issued emergency visas to relatives of victims.
   In the last two years, there have been a number of incidents
involving Boeing jets losing engines, wheels, or parts of their
fuselage. Most were blamed on metal fatigue, which can affect older
jetliners.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said in Seattle the plane that crashed
Saturday was delivered to Continental Airlines, apparently in 1968.
Cole said Continental may have leased it to TAN-SAHSA or it could
have been leased through an intermediary.
   On Dec. 26, 1988, an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727, also built in
the late 1960s, made an emergency landing in Charleston, W.Va.,
after a 14-inch hole opened in its fuselage at 31,000 feet. There
were no injuries, but the incident led to a fleetwide inspection.
   An American Airlines Boeing 727 made a belly landing at
Dallas-Fort Worth on Sept. 21, 1988, after metal fatigue in its
landing gear prevented the pilot from opening the wheel well door.
Three people were injured in the evacuation.
   A flight attendant was killed and 61 people were injured April
28, 1988, when a portion of the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737 built in the 1960s ripped off at 24,000 feet over Hawaii.

   President Bush, astonished at the
destruction the Northern California earthquake tore through the San
Francisco Bay area, is pledging the government will ``do what's
necessary to fix it.''
   ``There's no ceiling on the compassion of the American people,''
Bush said Friday after what he called ``a very moving day'' touring
sites of devastation the earthquake left behind, including the
collapsed freeway that entombed uncounted bodies.
   ``I'm willing to do what's needed to be done,'' Bush said as he
walked amid the rubble of Santa Cruz's shattered business mall, a
few miles from the Tuesday quake's epicenter.
   He didn't promise a specific amount, and declined several times
to rule out the possibility of tax increases to pay for recovery
costs.

   School, work and the
northern California earthquake may limit the crowd of spectators to
100,000 people when the space shuttle lands here next week, a NASA
spokeswoman said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to touch down at this Mojave Desert base
at 12:38 p.m. PDT Monday.
   But there is some possibility that high winds might force NASA
to bring the shuttle back to Earth about 90 minutes early, or one
or two days later, the agency said Friday.
   A weekday landing should draw about 100,000 spectators to the
public viewing site on the east shore of Rogers Dry Lake, said
Nancy Lovato, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady says Bush
administration officials knew before stock market trading began
last Monday they likely weren't facing a repeat of the 1987 crash.
   ``I don't think anybody had an air of panic,'' Brady said Friday
in his first extensive public discussion of the sudden, 190-point
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13.
   As senior administration gathered at the White House at 7 a.m.
Monday, the first trading day after the plunge, they focused on the
reaction of foreign markets, which had been closed during the
Friday the 13th plummet, he said.
   ``It became clear as I stared at those statistics that it looked
much more like a technical market change. ... (The U.S. stock
decline) was picked up around the rest of the world, but not added
to. That is an important distinction,'' he said in an interview.

   Touting a newfound readiness to ``face the
truth,'' East Germany's new communist leadership has appealed for
the first time to those who have fled West to come home.
   Also Friday, pro-democracy activists kept up the pressure on the
new leadership to agree to reform. More than 10,000 pro-democracy
supporters staged a rally in the provincial city of Zittau,
opposition leaders said Friday.
   A spokesman for the East German Foreign Ministry appealed to the
tens of thousands of East German refugees who have fled to West
Germany in recent months to return home.
   Spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said East Berlin's diplomatic missions
would help East Germans return home as quickly as possible.

   The archbishop of Canterbury helped the
Episcopal Church celebrate its 200th anniversary in America and
praised the leaders of the church for compromising on a dispute
over the ordination of women.
   Archbishop Robert A.K. Runcie, spiritual head of the world's 70
million Anglicans, celebrated the Eucharist and visited with
Episcopalians on Friday in the hometown of Suffragan Bishop Barbara
C. Harris of Massachusetts, the church's first woman bishop.
   The Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of the Anglican Communion,
was founded in 1789 as the first free and independent Anglican
church outside the British Isles.
   The Episcopal House of Bishops, the ruling body of the church,
last month issued a statement affirming the ordination of women
while calling for sensitivity toward those who believe women
shouldn't be ordained.

   Five railroad cars full of rotting refuse
were on their way back to Philadelphia today after state officials
won a court order blocking a plan to dump the garbage in Indiana.
   The state Department of Environmental Management said the four
companies involved in carting the trash lacked a permit allowing
garbage to be transferred from railroad cars to dump trucks.
   The cars headed back Friday after the state obtained a
restraining order against the dumping and threatened to fine the
trash haulers $25,000 for each day the garbage was parked at a
Terre Haute rail yard. The order was issued by a Clay County
circuit judge in Brazil, Ind.
   The household trash originally was destined for the Center Point
Landfill near Brazil, about 60 miles west of Indianapolis near
Terre Haute.
