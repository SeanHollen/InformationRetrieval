   Famed violinist Eugene Fodor Jr., arrested last
week on drug possession and breaking and entering charges, was
released on his own recognizance Monday.
   Fodor, 39, is an internationally acclaimed musician who has won
top honors in both the Tchaikovsky and Paganini violin
competitions. He also has performed at the White House.
   Maids at the Vineyard Harbor Hotel on Martha's Vineyard
discovered Fodor in an unoccupied motel room Thursday. He was later
arraigned on charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit
a felony; trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute; possession of a hypodermic needle; possession
of heroin; and possession of a dangerous weapon _ a dagger.
   Fodor was held on $50,000 cash bail at the Dukes County Jail
over the weekend after a judge refused to accept his 300-year-old
violin as bail, officials said.
   On Monday, Edgartown Superior Judge Joseph S. Mitchell released
Fodor on his own recognizance. A pre-trial conference was scheduled
for Sept. 7.
   Some family members blamed the incident on Fodor's recent drug
problems. Colleagues said Fodor had not performed as frequently in
recent years and never reached the top ranks of virtuosos.
   Fodor, a Denver native, made his debut with the Denver Symphony.
In 1974, he shared a silver medal with two Soviet violinists in the
Tchaikovsky violin competition in Moscow. He later won the Paganini
International Violin Competition in Genoa, Italy, and most recently
completed a concert tour in South America.
   Relatives said Fodor was on vacation when he was arrested.

   The Senate voted unanimously on Monday to
condemn the apparent execution of kidnapped Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins as an ``outrageous act of terrorism'' and urged President
Bush to consider retaliation if possible.
   The vote on the amendment, sponsored by Senate Majority leader
George Mitchell of Maine and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas was 99-0. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, is ill and did not
vote.
   ``The United States must take the lead in bringing to an end
what has become an international scourge,'' Mitchell said
immediately before the Senate voted.
   ``All nations must act,'' he said. ``If an end is to be put to
terrorism those nations must consult, coordinate and act.''
   ``Faint-hearted efforts and half steps only embolden
terrorists,'' Mitchell said. ``The United States must not shrink
from pursuing every effort to ensure the American people are free
from what is now the possible danger of attack when overseas.''
   Dole, who earlier had crticized Israel for not informing the
United States before seizing suspected terrorists, a step that
allegedly led to Higgins' reported killing, made clear his mind had
not been changed.
   He said that beyond sending a message to terrorist groups and to
nations like Iran _ suspected of being a driving force behind them
_ ``we also want to send a message to our friends.''
   The message: ``This is a very serious matter and we believe that
in any future efforts there should be some notification, some
coordination, and maybe more responsibility assumed by our
friends.''
   Outside the Capitol, the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith
said it was shocked by Dole's remarks because they ``failed to
place the blame for Col. Higgins' murder where it truly belongs,
with Iran and the Hezbollah terrorists.''
   ``We must support each other, directing our efforts against
those responsible for the evil of terrorism,'' said a statement
from Burron S. Levinon, chairman, and Abraham H. Foxman, national
director.
   The National Association of Arab-Americans said it condemned
those responsble for Col. Higgins' execution, which it called
``reprehensible,'' but said it supported Dole's remarks and
believed Israeli leaders knew their kidnapping of a Hezbollah
leader would ``set off a cuycle of violence and retribution.''
   The Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, The
Associated Press correspondent who is the longest-held hostage,
said in a message to Bush and members of Congress it was ``gravely
concerned about U.S. reaction. As Terry's sister, Peggy Say, said
today, this is no time for revenge. Violence only begets violence.
We urge you to use restraint and explore all avenues of peaceful
discussions with Iran.''
   The Senate resolution condemned Higgins' reported death as
``barbaric, cowardly, and utterly imcompatible with the standards
of conduct upheld by civilized people.''
   ``The president should utilize all available resources of the
United States government ... to determine the responsibility of
those responsible ...,'' it said.
   ``The president should determine whether it would be possible to
isolate and bring to justice or retaliate against those responsible
in a manner that would reduce the risk to Americans from
terrorism,'' the non-binding resolution said.
   And it said the president should urgently consult Israel and
other governments ``concerning their policies and actions which
might have relevance to the interests of the United States or
increase the vulnerability of U.S. citizens to attacks by
terrorists''
   Other congressional reaction to the reported execution of an
American hostage ranged from calls for revenge to warnings that
such moves would only worsen conditions in the volatile Middle East.
   ``We can't blow Lebanon up simply to avenge the life of one
American,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said: ``No cause or
political goal can be used to justify such a despicable, cowardly
act.''
   ``As for options, we're back to square one,'' said Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``It's a horrible mess.''
   Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
called the reported execution ``a dreadful, horrible, devastating
action. I know the president is as horrified as we are. This will
be discussed at the highest levels. And I am sure we will be
cooperating with the executive branch.''
   Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, lamented that ``with every
passing year it seems that some areas of the Islamic world are
moving farther and farther away from the orbit of civilized
nations.''
   Others were more blunt. Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said ``We need
revenge and we need justice, and I will support the president in
whatever means he might employ to bring them about.''
   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., added: ``The president should
do everything he thinks is necessary to avenge this killing. And I
mean he should consider every possible retaliatory action.''
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked Bush in a letter to award
Higgins the Medal of Honor.
   ``This tribute is customarily issued to soldiers who prove valor
in military actions, or in peacetime, demonstrate unique acts of
bravery,'' McConnell told the Senate.
   ``I think Rich's record is clear,'' he said. ``His selfless
efforts to secure peace in a nation consumed by bloodshed and
battle should be recognized and honored.'' Higgins was born in
Danville, Ky.

<HEAD>Cows Taught to Avoid Poisonous Plants, May Help Stem Ranching Losses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal scientists have taught cows to avoid
eating a poisonous plant, but the cattle act more like lemmings
when gripped by the psychology of the herd.
   In newly reported studies, cows that learned to avoid the tall
larkspur did fine when they grazed by themselves. But they started
to eat it when they mingled in the pasture with untrained animals
that were enjoying the tasty plant, which has caused serious losses
in some Western herds.
   ``The peer pressure appears to be very, very strong,'' said
range scientist Michael Ralphs.
   There may be ways to fight it, said Ralphs, of the federal
Agricultural Research Service's Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory
in Logan, Utah.
   The training approach may also help with other problem plants,
such as locoweed, he said.
   He spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the work at
the Third International Symposium on Poisonous Plants, which
concluded Saturday in Logan.
   The tall larkspur may kill more than 2,000 cows a year on
high-altitude summer pastures in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Utah and Wyoming, Ralphs said. Ranchers can lose up to 10 percent
of their herds, he said.
   Cattle relish the plant, which resembles the garden delphinium,
said study co-author John D. Olsen.
   Ranchers build fences or spray herbicides to fight the problem,
both expensive strategies, Ralphs said. Sometimes they pass up the
chance to graze cattle on lush grass and other nutritious plants in
larkspur-infested pastures.
   The new work is designed to make cattle associate the taste of
tall larkspur with feeling ill. After eating small, safe doses of
larkspur, cattle were made to feel nauseous by infusion of a
chemical through a tube to their stomachs.
   Ralphs said the training made five one-year-old heifers avoid
the plant when turned loose in a small rangeland plot. When they
returned the year after training, the aversion persisted.
   But when they were allowed to mingle with untrained cattle that
ate larkspur, the trained cows started eating it too.
   ``Apparently if they observe another animal eating it, they're
tempted to try it,'' Olsen said. `And if they eat it then without
any ill consequence, then the taste aversion is lost, or at least
reduced.''
   To overcome this peer pressure, researchers tried another
experiment with five pairs of cattle. One member of each pair was
trained, and then it and its partner were offered small doses of
larkspur. When the trained animal started eating, it got another
dose of the nausea-inducing chemical.
   ``They must learn that even though my neighbor does, I must
avoid it,'' Ralphs explained.
   This summer, researchers plan to see if cows already familiar
with the pastureland can be trained to resist the peer pressure
there. Another approach may be to train young animals and keep them
separate from larkspur-eating cows for a year or so until their
feeding patterns are set, Ralphs said.
   Scientists still must find a way to make the training procedure
practical for ranches, he said.

   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a U.S. marine held hostage in
Lebanon and facing execution, said when he graduated from high
school that his main ambition was to make his family proud.
   After he was kidnapped nearly 1{ years ago, his uncle said
Higgins had fulfilled that goal.
   ``He loves his country,'' said Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, Ky.
``He is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will
under the circumstances. ... I don't think they could bring enough
pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way.''
Eagle died four months ago.
   The Shiite Moslems holding Higgins said Sunday they would hang
him unless Israel released a Shiite Moslem clergyman kidnapped by
Israeli commandos. They gave an 8 a.m. EDT deadline for Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid to be freed.
   When he was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, Higgins, 44, headed a
75-member observer group assigned to the U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon. He was returning from talks with a moderate
Shiite Moslem militia leader that reportedly touched on foreign
hostages.
   In December, Higgins' kidnappers said they had sentenced him to
death as a spy for Israel. A statement issued by the captors did
not state an execution date for Higgins, a one-time aide to former
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Higgins, born in Danville, Ky., grew up in southern Jefferson
County, Ky.
   By the time he left for college, he was well on the way to
fulfilling the ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook: ``For
my family to always be proud of me.''
   He won appointment to West Point, but he chose instead to study
at Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship.
   He was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated in
1967 with a business degree, and later earned master's degrees from
Pepperdine University and Auburn University in Alabama.
   Higgins served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972 and later was a rifle
company commander in Okinawa, Japan, an instructor at the staff
non-commissioned officers academy at Quantico, Va., and a rifle
company commander at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   Higgins served in various staff positions at Marine Corps
headquarters in Washington and at the Pentagon, and graduated from
the National War College in 1985.
   He has a 17-year-old daughter, Christine Lynn, with his first
wife, Bonita Spalding of Louisville, Ky.
   His second wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, works at the
Pentagon.

<HEAD>Ignoring the Jeers, Utah Moves Ahead With Fusion Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cold fusion researcher Stanley Pons has
given up trying to convince critics that he and colleague Martin
Fleischmann may have unlocked the power of the sun in a laboratory
beaker.
   But if many physicists have ridiculed the notion of table-top,
room-temperature fusion, it's become a boom industry in Utah, where
the two chemists enjoy strong support.
   Pons' University of Utah has leased a research center and a Utah
congressman is preparing a bill to create a national center here; a
private group of boosters has been created to help Pons and
Fleischmann win over non-believers.
   Pons said months of stinging criticism have taken their toll,
leaving him frustrated and weary of meetings with skeptical and
sometimes hostile colleagues.
   ``It's a bit depressing, to say the least,'' he said last week.
``They're saying it can't be done, but they can't explain our
results.''
   Pons may have given up on the critics, but neither he nor the
university is about to give up on cold fusion.
   Bolstered by $4.5 million in state funds, the university has
signed a lease for an off-campus fusion research center, and Pons
and Fleischmann are writing a new paper expanding the theory behind
their experiments.
   ``When you know you're right it's a lot easier to move ahead. We
know the science is there,'' said James Brophy, the university's
vice president for research. ``With this beginning of seed money
and with corporate support, we'll define what the possibilities
are.''
   Brophy said negotiations are under way with General Electric,
which has agreed to collaborate with the two scientists. He would
not provide further details.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter, the state Legislature and the congressional
delegation are firmly behind Pons and Fleischmann, of Britain's
University of Southampton. A bill by Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens
would create a national fusion research center at the university,
which is in his district. The bill's chances were hurt by a July 12
report by the U.S. Energy Department's Energy Research Advisory
Board, which concluded there was no convincing evidence that cold
fusion works.
   Pons and Fleischmann startled scientists with their March 23
announcement that they had sustained a fusion reaction by running
an electrical current between electrodes of palladium and platinum
immersed in heavy water, so called because instead of normal
hydrogen it contains the heavier isotope deuterium.
   Pons said the process had produced more than 50 times the amount
of energy that went into it. If true, it could lead to technology
that would provide the world with an unlimited, relatively clean
supply of energy.
   Fusion involves the combining of atoms and should be safer than
fission, atom-splitting, which has been used to produce nuclear
power.
   Initial excitement among scientists turned to ire as major
laboratories were unable to duplicate the process. The two
scientists were openly ridiculed during the annual meeting of the
American Physical Society in Baltimore in April.
   Pons said the laboratories that could not achieve fusion hadn't
done their experiments right, adding that he was frustrated by
scientists who dismissed his findings without providing details of
their own methodology.
   ``They just say it didn't work and walk away. They don't publish
anything,'' said Pons, who himself was criticized for announcing
his findings rather than publishing details of the research.
   ``It is tremendously frustrating. It puts you on your knees
because you don't have any idea what they're doing. They don't give
you the opportunity. You made a mistake if you say you saw heat. If
you see tritium, you're insane.''
   Radioactive tritium, another isotope of hyodrogen, can only be
produced in a fusion reaction. Pons claimed tritium was created
during his experiment. About a dozen labs around the world also
have reported finding tritium in their fusion experiments. Among
them was the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which did not confirm
that the experiment produced fusion.
   Pons said many scientists who have achieved fusion are holding
back their results for fear of public humiliation.
   A new private organization, the Fusion Information Center, has
started an education campaign aimed at convincing the world that
Pons and Fleischmann are right.
   ``I like to tell people it's the most important discovery since
Adam's rib,'' said Hal Fox, a retired missile systems engineer who
is funding the group and is its president.

<HEAD>During Final Days in Office, Pierce Pushed Disputed Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal housing officials say they are
reviewing two contracts approved by Samuel Pierce in his final days
as housing secretary, and agency sources say Pierce endorsed one
project over stiff objections from HUD experts.
   The two contracts, worth several hundred thousand dollars, were
placed on hold shortly after the Jan. 20 change in administrations
ended Pierce's eight-year tenure at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   One contract was to go to a firm headed by two prominent black
Republicans and the other to a company whose president had a
longstanding friendship with a former Pierce deputy, HUD officials
said. The officials asked that they not be identified by name.
   Pierce's role in these contracts came to the attention of HUD
investigators about two weeks ago, the HUD sources said.
   HUD spokesman Jack Flynn, asked about the January approvals,
confirmed that they were among a number of pending contracts put on
hold after Jack Kemp succeeded Pierce as HUD secretary.
   Several department sources said HUD staffers had questioned the
need for the consulting arrangements and had criticized the
proposals as poorly drafted.
   The contracts were issued under a technical assistance program
that HUD auditors have criticized on grounds that many contractors
provided too few services and spent too much money on overhead and
administrative costs.
   Pierce's approval of the projects was not improper, but his role
is at odds with his congressional testimony. In sworn testimony in
May, he told Congress he took no direct role in agency funding
decisions.
   Repeated attempts to reach Pierce in recent weeks have been
unsuccessful. He has an unlisted home telephone number, and has not
returned messages left at his former law office in New York.
   One contract, to a company called One America Inc., was endorsed
by Pierce on Jan. 17 _ three days before he left the department _
according to HUD sources who said an agency selection committee
voted 6-1 against the contract.
   The other contract, to Mississippi-based Pro-Mark Inc., also was
approved by Pierce in mid-January, according to sources who said
the proposal was extensively revised before the review committee
approved it by a 5-3 margin.
   The presidents of both companies defend their proposal, both of
which dealt with minority enterprise.
   One America is headed by Elaine B. Jenkins, who once served on a
White House small business commission, and her husband, Howard
Jenkins, a former Labor Department official and the first black to
serve on the National Labor Relations Board.
   Pro-Mark president Les Range has close ties to Dubois Gilliam, a
former Pierce associate who approved earlier HUD contracts to the
company before he left the agency. Range said he appealed to Pierce
in the belief that criticisms of Pro-Mark's previous work may have
been racially motivated.
   The housing agency during Pierce's tenure became a wellspring of
cash for well-connected developers and consultants, and a stunning
example of mismanagement that allowed millions of dollars to
disappear through sloppy accounting practices.
   One America requested $421,000 to develop a computerized listing
of black entrepreneurs. Pierce approved the project at half that
amount despite the committee's recommendation to reject the
unsolicited proposal.
   HUD records indicate that One America, based in Silver Spring,
Md., has received four contracts worth more than $1.5 million from
the technical assistance program since 1981. The company once
shared an office and telephone number with the Council of 100, a
black Republican group. At the time, Mrs. Jenkins was the group's
chairwoman.
   In a telephone interview Friday, Mrs. Jenkins said One America
``has barely broken even'' on its HUD contracts and defended its
work as essential aid to small and minority-owned businesses with
little experience in dealing with the federal bureaucracy.
   Mrs. Jenkins said she does not know Pierce and played down her
political connections.
   ``Being a Republican has not yet been ruled illegal,'' she said.
``Neither has being a black Republican.'' She also dismissed the
timing of Pierce's approval, which came just three days before the
change of administrations in January.
   Pro-Mark is a Jackson, Miss., company that from 1985 through
1988 received $400,000 from HUD to provide technical advice on HUD
programs to small and minority-owned business in the state of
Mississippi.
   Initial funding for Pro-Mark was approved by Gilliam, a former
HUD deputy assistant secretary whose duties included oversight of
the technical assistance program. (Gilliam was indicted in April
for allegedly seeking to defraud the government in 1986 by making
money off a Mississippi project he had funded with HUD money.)
   Pro-Mark requested $240,500 to continue its HUD contract this
year. Pierce approved the contract at $150,000, but Kemp aides have
shipped the proposal back to HUD's Atlanta regional office because
of questions raised by current HUD officials.
   Pierce has been recalled by the congressional subcommittee he
appeared before in May and is scheduled to testify Sept. 15 and at
least once more after that.
   Since his earlier testimony, evidence of his involvement in
certain HUD projects has surfaced.
   A former agency official told congressional investigators she
was ordered by Pierce to fund a Durham, N.C., project supported by
the city's then-mayor, Charles Markham, a former law partner of
Pierce's.
   And files kept by Deborah Gore Dean, who for three years was
Pierce's top aide, indicate Pierce also took a personal role in
projects involving jazz musician Lionel Hampton and former GOP Sen.

   If your boss is making life miserable,
Earnest ``Dr. Buzzard'' Bratton says he can solve your problem with
a couple of shiny dimes, a teaspoon of black cat oil and an
incantation over a cemetery grave, plus $1,200 of your cash.
   ``A piece of cake,'' says Bratton, a self-proclaimed voodoo
witch doctor in this Washington suburb who says he's licensed by
the state of Virginia to administer herbs and potions.
   ``I have your boss removed from his job,'' he says. ``I give him
what I call the hotfoot. It works, no doubt about it. If it doesn't
work, there's no dogs in Georgia.''
   Bratton, 57, a native of Gaffney, S.C., says he was born with
magical powers and perfected them with the help of ghostly visions.
He boasts he can improve his clients' sex lives, rid them of pesky
neighbors, bring them good luck at the racetrack, retire debts,
cure rheumatism and banish assorted spells and curses.
   He says he can even help President Bush.
   ``Bush is all right. He's doing the best he can, but he seems a
little disoriented, a little shaky,'' he said. ``It would be a good
idea for him to come see the doctor. I could give him some
breathing room.''
   Bratton's basement apartment is littered with press clippings,
snapshots of Dr. Buzzard with fellow celebrities on late-night
television shows, and clumps of stuffing torn from his Naugahyde
sofa by his pet cat, Silver Dumpster.
   Bratton is proud of his videotape lecture titled ``Voodoo Hoodoo
Youdoo.'' The Learning Annex, a local university without walls
where he lectured recently, declared that ``Dr. Buzzard is to
voodoo what Jane Fonda is to Spandex.'' Voodoo's been his business
since he was 9.
   A table top in his apartment is covered with the tools of his
dark trade: candles in the shape of skull and crossbones, a jar of
``confusion oil,'' a bottle of all-purpose ``Hoyt's Cologne,'' a
plastic bag of graveyard dirt and another containing small blue
stones used for ``eliminating ordinary jinxes'' during a good soak
in the bathtub.
   There's a three-eyed coconut for ``sending people you don't like
out of town,'' which Bratton says he'd like to use against the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, and a ``Samson doll'' which he claims can save
innocent prisoners from the electric chair, with the collaboration
of his reclusive black cat.
   A dried hawk's claw is helpful in finding missing persons,
Bratton says, and such oddments as a buckeye, arrowroot, lodestone
and ``devil's shoestrings'' make dandy good-luck charms when
carried in a red flannel sack.
   His clients' most frequent complaint is a lousy sex life, and
the witch doctor claims he has the perfect cure: drink a potion
containing two beaten brown eggs mixed with 7-Up every morning for
12 days.
   And ``to put spice back in your life and keep on truckin','' he
says, carry a bunch of medium, brown-skinned onions in the
briefcase, purse or car trunk and eat one raw onion within 15
minutes after having sex. ``You'll jump up and down like you're in
Birmingham,'' he says.
   Bratton says he is capable of using his voodoo powers to have
someone killed within three hours. He would take dampened graveyard
dirt from a cow horn, inject it into a lemon with a golden-eyed
needle, utter some mumbo-jumbo and ``it's goodbye Charlie.''
   But Dr. Buzzard abhors violence and says he'd never take
someone's life. Instead, he prefers to find kinder, gentler
solutions to life's problems.
   Tear up your credit cards, he says, and go into business for
yourself. ``A job is just a shortcut to the grave.'' Pray every
night, and keep your goals to yourself because ``secrecy is
independency.''
   ``From an anthill to a milestone, success and progress is what
I'm looking for,'' Bratton says with a benevolent smile.

   House ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon
is disputing a law firm's statement that it contacted him several
times in 1986 and 1987 to lobby for a company with which his wife
now has a lucrative deal.
   The Washington law firm that represents Duty Free Shoppers Group
Ltd. told Justice's Office of Foreign Agents Registration that it
talked with Dixon three times and bought him dinner once in the
course of its work for the client.
   But Dixon, in written responses to questions about the meetings,
said the documents filed by the law firm contain erroneous
information.
   ``At no time have I ever been `lobbied' or have I ever engaged
in any discussion whatsoever concerning Duty Free Shoppers,'' the
California Democrat's response said. ``I have never helped Duty
Free Shoppers `with their legislation' (and I do not know if any
exists).''
   Betty Dixon, Dixon's wife, has a lucrative stake in a joint
venture with Duty Free Shoppers, the majority partner in a group
that operates stores at the Los Angeles International Airport.
   Dixon said the documents contain wrong information because he
never talked about Duty Free Shoppers with Ronald Brown, the
attorney that represented the San Francisco-based company. Brown,
now the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, worked for
Patton Boggs &amp; Blow.
   The law firm was paid at least $1.4 million over four years by
Duty Free Shoppers to pursue the company's legislative goals.
   ``In connection with its representation of Duty Free Shoppers,
Patton Boggs &amp; Blow has had contacts with Congressman Dixon (and
other members of Congress),'' the firm said in a statement.
   Brown did not return telephone calls, but Patton Boggs
reaffirmed the information in the Justice reports.
   The Dixons earned more than $150,000 in dividends in two years
from the airport operation after investing between $5,000 and
$15,000, according to Dixon's financial disclosure statements. In
addition, Mrs. Dixon's stake in the company has grown in value to
at least $100,000.
   Patton Boggs reported to Justice that it contacted Dixon three
times in early 1986 _ before Mrs. Dixon invested in the airport
concession _ and once in 1987. Mrs. Dixon invested in the
partnership in July 1986, three months after the airport board
awarded the concession.
   Here are the Dixon contacts listed in the documents:
   _On March 11, 1986, Duty Free Shoppers picked up a $187 dinner
tab for Dixon and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a member of the Los
Angeles airport board. Cochran was a consultant to the ethics
committee at the time.
   Dixon said the dinner bill for himself, Brown, Cochran and a
friend, Jay Preston Johnson, was mistakenly paid by Duty Free
Shoppers.
   ``Ron has told me DFS was billed due to a processing error,'' he
said. ``It was not a business dinner by any stretch of the
imagination and absolutely no conversation regarding DFS or the
L.A. airport occurred.''
   The foursome gathered to talk about Cameroon, an African nation
where Johnson served with the Agency for International Development,
Dixon said.
   _On Feb. 26, 1986, and the next day, Patton Boggs ``had
conferences (personal and telephonic) with the following ... Julian
Dixon,'' the reports said. The subject of the contacts involved
advice that Patton Boggs gave to Duty Free Shoppers ``concerning
its duty free stores'' in several cities, including Los Angeles,
the reports said.
   Dixon said the Feb. 26 event was a Patton Boggs ``social
function'' at which his wife _ not he _ had a brief conversation
about Duty Free Shoppers. Mrs. Dixon ``apparently learned about the
Duty Free Shoppers investment possibility'' at the event, Dixon
said.
   Of the Feb. 27 contact, Dixon said: ``I have no recollection of
such a contact (or with Ron Brown). Finally I am informed that Mr.
Brown's secretary at Patton Boggs has no reference to a contact
with me in her records. Thus, I am at a loss to explain or respond
to the Feb. 27, 1986, reference.''
   _ On Sept. 26, 1987, Patton Boggs contacted Dixon ``in
connection with the regulation of duty free shops by the Customs
Service,'' the documents say. Dixon said he attended a
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation function that day.
   ``Why a report of DFS-oriented contact has been made is a matter
I cannot explain. I was not lobbied by any person or organization
during that function,'' he said.
   Patton Boggs is required to file foreign agents disclosure forms
every six months on its work for Duty Free Shoppers, which is
headquartered in San Francisco but incorporated in Bermuda.
   Mrs. Dixon, who has a background in retailing, has a 12 percent
interest in two minority-owned companies that were formed to be
Duty Free Shoppers' partners in the Los Angeles airport concession.

<HEAD>Philippines May be Next to Get Debt Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines, with its $30 billion debt,
may be the next country to get help from banks under pressure to
help the Third World climb out of poverty, international finance
sources say.
   Mexico got first attention under Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady's debt-reduction plan. That country's annual debt payments
could be reduced by as much as $3 billion under a financial package
announced July 23.
   Brazil and Argentina owe a lot more than the Philippines _ $120
billion and $60 billion _ but sources say they will have to wait.
The new Argentine government of President Carlos Menem is still
settling in and Brazil will have an election in November.
   Another candidate for early help is Venezuela, where President
Carlos Andres Perez wants his country's $35 billion debt cut in
half. There has been pressure for action on Venezuela because of
bloody riots in February caused by austerity measures taken by the
government to help meet its payments.
   It is uncertain how much can be done for the Philippines, as it
is for Mexico despite the plan to reduce that country's $54 billion
debt. The success of the Mexico plan depends on bankers'
willingness to participate, experts say.
   ``Now the arrangement has been agreed for Mexico, there'll be a
question of reducing debt and interest for the Philippines too,''
said a banker who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Much will depend on how much pressure the Bush administration
exerts on banks to work out an agreement with the Philippines, as
it did on the Mexico debt problem, the banker said.
   One calculation is that the Philippines needs $1.7 billion in
new money over the next two years.
   For the Philippines, one expert _ who also spoke on condition of
anonymity _ predicted that an accord could be reached by the end of
August between that country's government and a committee of 12
banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. A meeting is due in
New York by mid-August.
   However, Haywood Fleisig, in charge of Philippine affairs at the
World Bank, said any action by commercial bankers would affect only
about $7.5 billion of that country's debt.
   Individual governments to which the Philippines also owe money
have already granted some relief. In May the governments put off
for six years any repayment of principal and three-quarters of the
interest on $1.85 billion due them.
   Incomes in the Philippines, as in many African and Latin
American countries, have declined during much of the 1980s.
   President Corazon Aquino said last week the Philippine situation
is getting better, although 500,000 people have crossed the poverty
line since she took office three years ago. The average Filipino
earned about $590 in 1987, according to the World Bank.
   Venezuela has long been a richer country than either Mexico or
the Philippines because of its oil resources. Nearly all its
borrowing has been from commercial banks rather than from
governments or official bodies.
   But a committee of bankers, chaired by Chase Manhattan Corp.,
refused Venezuela's debt-reduction proposal last week, and more
meetings are due in August.
   The average Venezuelan's income was $3,230 in 1987. The drop in
the price of oil had brought that down from the $4,920 of 1982.
   Another country that could get help from the bankers is Costa
Rica, said Richard E. Feinberg, vice president of the Overseas
Development Council, a private study group on Third World problems.
   Costa Rica owes about $4.5 billion, much less than the
Philippines and Venezuela, but Costa Rica is a much smaller country
and the World Bank calculates the debt burden on the average
citizen is higher than that on the average Filipino or Mexican.

<HEAD>Farmer-Owned Cooperatives Making a Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmer-owned cooperatives are showing healthy
signs again after suffering financial setbacks during the early and
mid-1980s, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Preliminary figures for 50 of the nation's 100 largest farm
cooperatives show that total revenues in 1988, despite drought,
rose by 9 percent and that profits, or net margins, were up 28
percent from 1987.
   Michael D. Kane, an economist for the department's Agricultural
Cooperative Service, said also that co-ops last year showed a
``significant 6 percent decline in long-term debt'' and put greater
reliance on cooperative bank financing.
   ``In somewhat dramatic fashion, farmer cooperatives continued
their recovery from the agricultural recession of the 1980s,'' Kane
writes in the current issue of Farmer Cooperatives magazine.
   The 9 percent growth business last year pushed estimated total
revenues of the top 100 co-ops to nearly $46.9 billion. But that
was still far short of the record level of around $58 billion set
in 1981 before the slump began.
   ``Drought-induced higher commodity prices brought greater
marketing revenues on reduced volume while farm supply sales and
volume also improved,'' Kane said.
   Marketing co-ops, those that handle grain and other commodities
for farmers, had sales estimated at more than $33 billion, up 6
percent from 1987.
   ``Most farm supply cooperatives report growth in overall sales,
particularly fertilizer,'' he said. ``Fertilizer sales among the
top 100 are estimated to increase more than $900 million in 1988
because higher domestic and export tonnage drove up total dollar
sales.''
   Looking at profit sheets, Kane said net margins to the top 100
co-ops last year were estimated at more than $920 million,
accounting for the 28 percent increase from $717.3 million in 1987.
   ``Net margins would have topped the billion-dollar mark except
for major losses in petroleum refinery operations,'' he said.
``Regardless, net margins are expected to reach their highest level
since 1980.''

   It's okay to clean up the environment, just
don't do it at the expense of hungry people, says Orville L.
Freeman, president of the Agriculture Council of America.
   ``There is danger that these needs of the hungry will be
obscured while the affluent 10 percent of the world looks for a
broad brush and quick fix to environmental problems that have been
decades in the making,'' he said at a recent conference on future
global problems.
   ``In our haste to atone for environmental sins of the past, we
must not delude ourselves about the realities of the future,''
Freeman said. ``We must guide the world to a technology that meets
the need of both humanity and the environment.''
   The council is a private, non-profit organization based in
Washington. It represents all segments of agriculture and
frequently concentrates on trade and world issues that affect
American farmers and consumers.
   Freeman, a former governor of Minnesota, was secretary of
agriculture during the 1960s in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations.
   ``The estimated population growth for the next quarter-century
is so enormous that warning bells should be sounding in every
quadrant of the globe,'' Freeman said. ``Feeding this population
may very well be the greatest challenge we have ever faced _ one
that will test the world's productive and technological
capabilities to their very limits.''
   Freeman said that projections show the world's population will
increase by more than 1 billion people to 6.2 billion by the turn
of the century and to nearly 11 billion by 2050.

   Japanese farmers are finding it cheaper to
import hay and other forage than to grow it themselves.
   A report by the Agriculture Department says Japan's strong yen
is a major reason that forage imports are so cheap.
   ``In addition, Japanese farmers are importing higher quality
forages in an effort to increase the fat content of their fluid
milk production,'' the report in the department's Foreign
Agriculture magazine said. ``A new support price mechanism requires
higher fat content in milk for qualification of support payments.''
   Finally, it said, there is less rice straw available because of
Japan's rice land diversion program, and rainy weather has reduced
domestic roughage supplies.

<HEAD>Acclaimed Violinist Spends Weekend in Jail on Drug Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violinist Eugene Fodor Jr., whose intensity and
talent won him early rewards at the White House and in Moscow, has
landed in jail on charges that relatives said stemmed from a drug
problem.
   Fodor, 39, was being held on cocaine trafficking, cocaine and
heroin possession and breaking-and-entering charges after a judge
refused to accept his offer of a 300-year-old violin to guarantee
bail. Instead, the judge Friday set $50,000 cash bail.
   On Thursday, chambermaids at a Martha's Vineyard hotel found him
in a room that was supposed to be empty and called police, who said
they found 20 grams of cocaine, heroin, a hypodermic needle and a
dagger in Fodor's possession.
   Fodor's father said he had no warning that his son was in
trouble.
   ``The first I knew about it was when I read today's paper,''
Eugene Fodor Sr. of Morrison, Colo., said Saturday. He planned
today to travel to Edgartown, where his son was jailed.
   Fodor was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard when he was arrested
at the Vineyard Harbor Hotel.
   A family member in New York who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Sunday the arrest likely stems from Fodor's drug use, which
she said may be rooted in the same intensity that fires his musical
creativity.
   ``The only explanation I can think of is that he does everything
in a thorough way,'' she said. ``He's a genius in his work and he
devotes all his energy to his work. He's very intense in whatever
he does.''
   Fodor, who was born in Denver and lives in New York City, began
playing the violin at age 8. He made his debut as a young soloist
with the Denver Symphony. He has performed at the White House; at
Carnegie Hall in New York; in Moscow, where in 1974 he became the
first American winner of the Tchaikovsky Violin Competition; at the
Paganini International Violin Competition in Genoa, Italy; and most
recently in concert halls in South America.
   But some colleagues said Fodor had not performed as often in
recent years and critics said he never reached the top ranks of
virtuosos.
   The violinist's ex-wife, Susan Davis, of Vienna, Va., said she
was stunned to learn of his arrest and his attempt to use the
violin as surety for bond.
   Davis said Fodor called her early Friday and sounded frightened.
She said his managers have not guided him properly.
   ``He's a very serious musician, but when he came back from
Moscow, they billed him as the Mick Jagger of classical music,''
she said.
   The family member in New York said Fodor became involved in
drugs relatively recently, ``out of nowhere.'' She said Fodor's
career had been going well in recent months.
   She added that Fodor has ``plenty of money'' so it was unclear
why he would need a free place to sleep or to offer his violin for
bail.
   Fodor also was charged with possession of a hypodermic needle
and possession of a dangerous weapon _ a dagger.

   Sherrie L. Hassenger was working in her yard
in tiny Birkenfeld, Ore., when the telephone call came from
Randolph Air Force Base in Texas last June 8.
   The Air Force told her of a report from Laos that her husband,
Arden K. Hassenger, may have been seen. Hassenger, now 53, was lost
over Laos on Christmas Eve 1965 during an armed reconnaissance
flight.
   ``They just told me there was a possible sighting,'' she said
Friday at the annual convention of the National League of Families
of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia.
   ``It's telling me that there's a possibility that he is alive,''
she said, fighting back tears. ``And I have a lot more hope. It's
information that I would rather have than some people that are
getting a box of bones, a tooth, or whatever, the remains. I'm
thankful for the information.''
   It was the first clue to her husband's whereabouts since he was
lost along with five other crew members. A follow-up letter June 12
said the report included information taken from dog tags.
   The dog tags carry military personnel's serial numbers,
religious affiliation and residence.
   As a result of the call and letter, Mrs. Hassenger decided to
attend her first convention in 12 years. She went for support in
her quest for information, to make contact with relatives of other
crew members, and to find renewed solidarity after years of
wondering in isolation.
   ``Well, they've always told me that they would take care of it,
the Air Force,'' she said. ``And I live so far away from everyone,
I just didn't have the tactics or the know-how. I didn't know that
I was supposed to keep calling, harassing, what I was supposed to
do to get information ... But now I have friends that are going to
help me.''
   Chief Master Sgt. Hassenger is one of 2,348 Americans still held
prisoner, missing or unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. The number
includes 42 civilians, two of whom are women, according to Pentagon
figures supplied by the league. Of those, 1,714 are believed to be
in Vietnam.
   As of July 3 this year, there have been 1,210 firsthand live
sighting reports in Indochina since 1975, the league says, again
using Pentagon figures. Of those reports, 1,078 have been resolved,
including 805 who have since left Indochina, and 273 were
fabrications.
   There are 70 so-called ``discrepancy cases,'' high-priority
cases in which Americans have been reportedly seen as prisoners.
Hassenger, according to a Defense Intelligence Agency message, was
reportedly ``unable to leave'' Laos.
   Since 1973, 235 sets of remains have returned, the bulk of those
in the last nine years.
   Congressmen and members of the Bush administration who addressed
the convention told the families the missing servicemen are a
front-burner issue, but that much depends on the vagaries of
politics in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   ``The fullest possible accounting remains a matter of highest
national priority,'' Bush told the group. Bush said he has asked
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to raise the issue this week
during an international conference on the future of Cambodia.
   Over the past year there has been progress in dealing with
Hanoi: a series of technical meetings and investigations, more
remains returned from Vietnam.
   But the frustration is growing among family members.
   ``I think they're dragging their feet and pretty soon they'll be
dead and then we don't have an issue, do we?'' said Lorene Walker,
61, of Rapid City, S.D. Her son, Bruce, has been missing for 17
years.
   Bruce Walker's father, Charles, 63, expressed impatience with
the administration and members of Congress for relying on the
Indochinese governments.
   ``As an alternative to directly confronting the Vietnamese, the
CIA must be good for something,'' he said. ``You go find out for
sure what exactly is happening in a country. We do it every place
else. I don't know why we've pulled everybody out of Vietnam.''

   President Bush says he's not too happy with
the way things are turning out between himself and Congress, but
then, ``Nobody ever said it would be easy.''
   Bush's resigned commentary came as he emerged from a rough
stretch that saw his policy positions _ from military spending to
savings and loan bailout _ undergo a trouncing on Capitol Hill.
   ``I would not give Congress very high marks on doing what I want
done on legislation,'' Bush told reporters in a news conference
Friday when he was asked to rate his legislative success.
   But in keeping with his repeated comments about wanting to work
harmoniously with the Democratic-controlled Congress, Bush said he
would not get into personal criticism.
   ``I have to work with these people,'' the president said. ``I
have never been too hot at being a name-caller.''
   After spewing anti-Congress rhetoric with gusto during his
presidential campaign last year, Bush launched his presidency with
an inaugural address calling for a bipartisan working spirit
between the White House and Congress. The American people do not
want to see their leaders bickering, the new president said.
   But Democrats now say such conciliatory language belies an
unsettling pattern in which Bush takes the high road while his
aides and Republican allies undermine legislative agreements.
   ``Bush wants `kinder and gentler' while his people are gnawing
your legs off,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   The president has encountered several rough patches recently on
Capitol Hill.
   Last Thursday, the House scrambled the administration's defense
spending priorities by slashing key weapons systems Bush wants and
adding money for others that he wants to cut out.
   Also last week, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a savings
and loan bailout plan, but dealt Bush a setback by rejecting a
funding mechanism he sought to keep the billions of bailout dollars
out of the federal budget.
   Bush complained Congress has dragged its feet on the bailout. He
sent his plan to the lawmakers in February with a request for
urgent action within 60 days. After more than five months, the
package heads to the Senate floor this week.
   On another front, lawmakers are moving ahead with legislation
against flag-desecration, in lieu of the constitutional amendment
that Bush favors. The House Judiciary Committee last week blocked
consideration of a constitutional amendment and passed the
legislative approach.
   In addition, several of Bush's administration nominees are
getting a harsh reception in confirmation hearings. Several
ambassadorial nominees have been criticized as unqualified, and
Bush's choice to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division, William Lucas, is up against strong opposition.
   Some lawmakers criticize Bush for making expensive legislative
promises _ such as his call for missions to the moon and Mars _ and
leaving Congress to figure out how to pay for them.
   ``I think the president is going to find his good will here is
going to diminish,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
   Still, the president voices a desire for compromise and
negotiation.
   He said Friday that if he can't get the capital gains tax cut he
wants, ``let's see what can be worked out.''
   ``If there is some compromise that can spur investment, spur
jobs, increase employment because of new jobs starting up, I'd be
interested in it,'' he said.
   And he did not specifically say he would veto a bill outlawing
desecration of the flag, although didn't say he would sign it
either.
   But the president is skating on thin ice with many Democrats who
say the administration is talking out of both sides of its mouth.
   More than 80 Democrats cried foul in a letter to Bush on Friday
saying the National Republican Congressional Committee issued news
releases blasting more than 20 of them for voting last month to
support the president's position against random drug testing for
State Department employees.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., acknowledged that
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu is in on a strategy ``to
develop the wedge issues'' such as the flag to put Democrats on the
defensive.
   ``That does not bode well for a bipartisan working relationship
with the new Democratic leadership team'' in the House, said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the party's House campaign
organization.

<HEAD>More Arrested Women Than Men Used Cocaine in Some Cities, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A larger share of women than men were found to
have used cocaine in voluntary drug tests conducted after they were
arrested in four cities, a Justice Department study says.
   Cocaine use by women exceeded that of men arrested in New York,
Washington D.C., Kansas City and Portland, Ore., according to the
Drug Use Forecasting study by the National Institute of Justice.
   The study was conducted in 14 major cities among men and women
who volunteered for drug testing after being arrested.
   ``We were surprised to learn from DUF that among arrested
persons, women tested positive for illicit drugs at about the same
rates as did men at all test sites,'' James K. Stewart, director of
the National Institute of Justice, said in a statement released
Sunday.
   ``For many years, it had been thought that males were more
likely than were women to be illicit drug users,'' Stewart said.
   Overall, the study found that more than half of the men arrested
and tested were discovered to have used at least one type of drug,
with an overwhelming 82 percent of the males in Philadelphia
testing positive for drug use.
   ``There should be no longer any question as to how much of a
catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has become in America
today,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
``Drug users and traffickers will beat, rob and kill anyone for
drugs and profits.''
   The study reviewed results in 14 major cities from October
through December 1988. The tests checked for the presence of
cocaine, marijuana, opiates (including heroin), PCP, amphetamines,
Darvon, Valium, methaqualone, methadone and barbiturates.
   Women's cocaine use exceeded that of men arrested in New York,
73 percent to 67 percent; Washington D.C., 65 percent to 62
percent; Kansas City, 57 percent to 41 percent, and Portland, Ore.,
50 percent to 37 percent, the study said.
   Those higher percentages continued a trend noticed in an earlier
study covering July through September 1988.
   In the earlier report, Washington women led the pack with 78
percent testing positive for cocaine use compared with 59 percent
for the men. In Portland, the figures were 63 percent of the women
and 48 percent of the men; while the figures for other cities were
Los Angeles, 57 percent and 55 percent; Dallas, 53 percent and 52
percent; San Diego, 52 percent and 38 percent; and Phoenix, 31
percent and 25 percent.
   After Philadelphia, the second highest percentage for use of
drugs by arrested men was in San Diego, with 80 percent; followed
by New York and Chicago, 78 percent each; New Orleans, 75 percent;
and Portland and Birmingham, Ala., 70 percent.
   Rounding out the list were Detroit, 69 percent; Cleveland, 68
percent; Dallas and Phoenix, 57 percent; St. Louis, 56 percent; and
Kansas City, 54 percent.
   Washington D.C., which did not test for the presence of
marijuana, had 68 percent of the men test positive for at least one
of the other drugs tested.
   Most of the men tested had been arrested for felony offenses
other than the sale or possession of drugs. Slightly more than half
of the men charged with homicide tested positive for an illicit
drug.
   Among women tested, those found positive for use of at least one
of the 10 types of drugs ranged from a high of 80 percent in San
Diego to a low of 45 percent in St. Louis, the report said.
   Cocaine use among men arrested _ despite the higher percentage
among women in some cities _ has increased dramatically in some
areas, the report found.
   Stewart said the discovery that about one-fourth of those tested
in 13 cities said during interviews that they had injected drugs
raises a health concern.
   Meanwhile, only about one-quarter of those arrested, tested and
interviewed said they needed drug or alcohol abuse treatment.
   ``This suggests the need for improved supervision, monitoring,
or court-mandated requirements for arrestees to stay off drugs and
get treatment,'' Stewart said.

<HEAD>Israeli High Court Limits Army's Right to Blow Up Arab Houses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A civil rights group is applauding a Supreme
Court decision that restricts the Israeli army's right to demolish
the homes of Palestinians suspected of taking part in the uprising
in the occupied lands.
   In its strongest move yet to limit the army's powers to quell
the 19-month-old rebellion, Israel's highest court on Sunday ruled
that the military must allow appeals before destroying homes.
   The ruling was in response to an appeal by the Association for
Civil Rights in Israel.
   ``Our association has always believed that the drastic step of
demolition of houses ... is a form of collective punishment which
is not justified,'' association member David Presler said on Israel
radio.
   The three-member court ordered the army to inform owners of
houses slated for demolition that they could appeal to a military
commander and the Supreme Court.
   It said that in some cases, a house may be sealed before the
appeal hearing, ``as opposed to demolition, which is irreversible.''
   Presiding Judge Meir Shamgar said, however, that the army has
the right to immediately demolish a house in case of ``operational
military needs,'' such as in combat.
   A military spokesman said 227 houses have been demolished in the
occupied territories during the uprising. Palestinian groups say
the number is higher.
   The U.S. State Department in February said the demolitions
violated the Geneva Conventions on human rights and ignored due
process because suspects' houses were torn down before they were
tried.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry responded by saying the measure was
used ``only in very exceptional circumstances as dictated by
compelling security requirements.''
   In court arguments, the state prosecutor's office and the army
said an appeal period is granted automatically according to army
policy, except in ``serious and exceptional cases'' that involve
fatalities or injuries.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor said in an army radio interview
that there was no reason to change the law. ``We are talking about
the use of emergency regulations,'' he said.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 525
Palestinians have been killed in clashes with army troops and
Israeli settlers in the occupied lands. Thirty-eight Israelis have
died.
   In addition, Palestinians have killed 85 fellow Arabs accused of
collaborating with Israel during the uprising.

<HEAD>Iowa Crash Investigators To Examine Parts From Six Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG REYNOLDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators probing the crash of a DC-10
in Iowa have recalled metal disks from the tail engines of six
other DC-10s to check for possible flaws, a government spokesman
said.
   The recall was recommended after National Transportation Safety
Board investigators found the 3-foot-diameter disks, which hold the
fan blades of the General Electric Co. engines, may have been cut
from the same slab of metal used in the jet that crashed, said Ted
Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman.
   Investigators want to examine the quality of the metal used in
making the disks, he said Sunday.
   The agency's investigators believe the fan section of the engine
on United Airlines Flight 232 disintegrated in flight, possibly
causing the hydraulic-steering system failure that caused the July
19 crash in Sioux City, Iowa. The crash killed 111 people.
   The disk from Flight 232 hasn't been found.
   A spokesman for GE's Aircraft Engines division, Dwight Weber,
said it had not been determined that the parts being removed from
the six jetliners contained flaws.
   The recall ``is part of a data-gathering procedure in order to
see if they can tell anything about the missing disk,'' Weber said
by telephone from his home in Cincinnati. ``We're going to work
with the NTSB to look them over.''
   Neither Weber nor Lopatkiewicz would identify the airliners with
disks being recalled, but Lopatkiewicz said one was operated by a
foreign airline and the others were flown by U.S. carriers.
   The disks are believed to have come from a billet, or slab, of
titanium used in 1970 at GE's jet engine plant in the Cincinnati
suburb of Evendale, Lopatkiewicz said.
   ``We don't have the disk from the actual aircraft,''
Lopatkiewicz said by telephone from his home in Falls Church, Va.
``So by looking at others made from same billet, we might be able
to learn something about the metallurgical quality of the disk
we're looking for.''
   The parts will be sent to GE's Evendale plant, where Flight
232's three CF6-6 engines were built, Lopatkiewicz said. They will
be examined by an NTSB team investigating the crash.
   Originally, eight disks for GE's CF6-6 engine were made from the
titanium slab, Lopatkiewicz said. One of the eight disks failed
quality-control tests and was scrapped, and another was used in the
tail engine of Flight 232, he said. The CF6-6 engine was produced
exclusively for the DC-10.
   The six others are being removed from the commercial jetliners
and most likely will be replaced before the aircraft return to the
skies, he said.
   Last week, Weber denied speculation by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich, that scrap parts may have been used in the DC-10 engine
that apparently failed on the Iowa flight.
   Dingell, who chairs a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
that oversees crash investigations, has asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used.

   The dollar dropped against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Monday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved
sharply higher.
   The dollar closed at 138.40 yen, down 1.05 yen from Friday's
139.45-yen finish. After opening at 138.90 yen, it ranged between
138.15 and 139.10 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues added 248.24 points, or 0.72 percent, closing at 34,953.87,
yet another record high.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the dollar fell gradually because the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board's move to relax monetary policy has made it less
attractive to Japanese buyers.
   Last week, the Federal Reserve Board was seen taking a relaxed
credit position by allowing the federal fund rate to move to 9
percent from 9.25 percent.
   The federal fund rate, the fee that banks charge one another on
overnight loans, is considered a barometer of the central bank's
credit policy.
   ``There is nothing happening here to turn investors away from
buying the dollar, except for the market sentiment for a weaker
dollar due to expectations that the Fed might further relax the
monetary policy,'' Kanai said.
   On the stock exchange market, ``trading was directionless
although the index rose,'' said Masahiro Umemori, a stock analyst
with Nomura Securities.
   He attributed the Nikkei's rebound to the yen's strength against
the dollar on the foreign exchange market.

<TEXT>
   The jaunty visage of his father smiles from one
wall and a worked-over cigar peeks out of an ashtray. But family
resemblance is not the reason Richard M. Daley looks so comfortable
at City Hall after just 100 days in office.
   Confidence is.
   The chunky, good-natured, 47-year-old son of Richard J. Daley,
the last of the big-city political bosses, is clearly on a roll.
   Daley does not hesitate when asked whether any problem has
seemed overwhelming in the short time since he stepped down as
state's attorney, walked across the street and set up shop in the
fifth-floor office his father occupied for more than 20 years.
   ``If I just threw up my hands over one problem, then maybe I'd
do it over another one and then again and again, and pretty soon,
the only reaction I'd have to anything would be walking around and
throwing up my arms,'' said Daley, who took office on his birthday,
April 24.
   His disarming wit and quick grasp of the workings of government
have surprised critics who ridiculed his carefully scripted
campaign appearances and referred to him as ``dumb-dumb Daley.''
   After a few days in office, he won praise for disdaining use of
the city's $50,000, armor-plated limousine after quipping that in
the event of a nuclear attack, he'd likely find himself the only
survivor.
   Similarly, he has confounded black opponents who predicted his
election would bring a return to the machine politics of his
father. Instead, Daley appropriated the central theme of their
campaigns _ empowerment of minorities and the disenfranchised.
   Eleven of his 21 cabinet appointments went to minorities, a
percentage roughly representative of the city's population, and one
of his first executive decisions was to extend the
affirmative-action program that was a legacy of the late Mayor
Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor.
   Daley helped engineer and guide through the City Council a
measure channeling revenues from an increased tax on cigarettes to
provide additional shelters for the homeless. Even his bitterest
enemies conceded it was innovative.
   Still, some critics say Daley's good spin control conceals a
lack of specific achievement.
   ``He's been pretty much the way we expected,'' said Lu Palmer, a
radio show host and self-described black nationalist.
   ``He hired a few African-Americans for certain spots, but most
of them were `safe' blacks and most of it was done to help his
chances to consolidate his power. On matters of police brutality,
poverty, schools, things don't seem any better and they may even be
worse.
   ``And what's made it worse is how slick he's been about
everything, and the honeymoon he seems to be carrying on with the
media,'' Palmer said.
   Daley ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1983. Then earlier this
year, after three terms as prosecutor, he defeated two of the
city's top black politicians _ acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer and
Alderman Tim Evans _ in a special election for the right to serve
the final two years of Washington's second term.
   In his re-election bid, Daley expects to face many of the same
doubts that dogged his steps the last time out _ especially from
those in the black community who insist his main qualification
remains his name.
   Huge property tax increases passed by the previous
administration have proved a two-edged sword _ deepening the city's
pockets, but inspiring nascent revolt in the Northwest Side
bungalow belt whose residents have been one of his strongest
constituencies.
   ``He seems like a man very much in control. I wouldn't bet
against him,'' said Mike Royko, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist of the Chicago Tribune.
   ``At this point, you'd have to say so far, so good. Of course,''
Royko added, ``that's what the guy who jumps off the top of the
John Hancock building says as he passes the 40th floor.''

<HEAD>Governors Sidestepping Abortion Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's governors are stepping carefully
around the emotional issue of abortion, avoiding direct discussion
of it at their annual meeting even as each ponders the political
quagmire it could create back home.
   While a small band of abortion-rights protesters demonstrated
outside Sunday, governors attending the four-day National
Governors' Association conference said they planned no discussion
of the issue despite the recent Supreme Court decision giving
states broader leeway to regulate abortion.
   Several acknowledged the issue may dominate their state's
politics and legislatures in coming months.
   ``It will bring out some polarized feelings,'' said Delaware
Gov. Michael Castle, a Republican. ``I think in the course of the
next year or two that will be a dominant issue.
   ``It's important that we not let it dominate our state
legislatures,'' Castle said. ``It has that ability to dominate
things so much that you can't do anything else.''
   Another governor sharing that concern was Maryland's William
Donald Schaefer.
   Schaefer, a Democrat, said he would ask the legislature to
confine debate and action on abortion to the first 30 days of its
next session.
   ``Otherwise it could disrupt and cause great problems,'' said
Schaefer, who since taking office has backed off a campaign
statement supporting Medicaid funding for abortions.
   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, chairman of the association, said
the governors weren't discussing abortion because their agenda was
set before the Supreme Court's ruling in a Missouri case.
   Baliles, a Democrat who supports legal abortions in most cases,
said formal discussion by the governors wouldn't likely produce an
agreement anyway.
   ``This is a decision that will have to be argued within each
state,'' he said. ``It is a topic that is unlikely to achieve the
kind of consensus that would produce a policy resolution by the
National Governors' Association.''
   In interviews, several governors sought to minimize the
discretion afforded to the states by the high court decision, which
eroded but did not overturn the earlier Roe vs. Wade decision
upholding a woman's right to an abortion.
   They had an eye, however, on abortion cases scheduled to come
before the Supreme Court this fall.
   ``You won't really know what the dimensions of this issue is
until the Supreme Court decides the three other cases pending,''
said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat. ``It's an emotional
issue. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, you've got a
whole different issue.''
   ``Most people are waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' said
Castle.
   In view of polls saying a majority of America support legalized
abortion in some cases, the issue may pose more political problems
for candidates who favor restricting or banning abortion, at least
in some states. In the two governors' races this year, in Virginia
and New Jersey, the Republican nominees have softened their
anti-abortion stands in recent weeks.
   Republican governors will have a look at a new poll on the
issue, commissioned by their party, at a closed meeting Tuesday,
said Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors'
Association. The conference ends Tuesday.
   Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, a Republican who leaves office
after this year, said he hoped the issue would not be so divisive
that voters elect candidates solely on how they stand on abortion.
   ``I think it would be a great tragedy if people were to decide
who to vote for just on this issue, because I think we'd elect some
very strange people,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson says President Bush has
offered no substance to support his professed commitment to civil
rights.
   Jackson, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday,
criticized Bush for backing recent Supreme Court rulings opposed by
civil rights leaders, failing to strengthen the Civil Rights
Commission and lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs.
   He credited Bush for directing less antagonism toward civil
rights than did his predecessor Ronald Reagan, but added: ``So far,
no substance.''
   Jackson said Bush's nomination of a black lawyer, Republican
William Lucas, to serve as the Justice Department's chief civil
rights advocate was ``a sinister play on race.''
   Jackson said Lucas was unqualified for the position because he
lacks trial experience, but that there are other Republican
minorities who are suited to the job.

<NOTE>Judge Penalizes Doctor for Patient Dumping</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency judge says a Texas
obstetrician let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his
judgment when he ordered a poor, sick woman who was about to give
birth transferred to another hospital 160 miles away.
   Dr. Michael L. Burditt is the first physician prosecuted for
violating a 1986 federal law against patient dumping. He is
expected to fight the $20,000 civil penalty imposed upon him by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The agency on Sunday released the 44-page ruling by
Administrative Law Judge Charles E. Stratton upholding the HHS
inspector general's sanctions against Burditt but reducing the fine
from $25,000 to $20,000.
   The Texas Medical Association has agreed to pay Burditt's legal
costs and any fine stemming from his handling of the case of Rosa
Rivera.
   Mrs. Rivera showed up at the emergency room of DeTar Hospital in
Victoria on Dec. 5, 1986, to have her sixth child without seeing a
doctor during the pregnancy and with blood pressure of 210 over 160
_ high enough to cause stroke and death.
   Burditt, then chief of the hospital's obstetrical department,
was summoned by phone to treat the indigent woman because he was
next on a list to handle emergency obstetrical calls.
   Burditt examined the woman and ordered her transferred to a
better equipped hospital in Galveston, despite the objections of
nurses worried that it would violate the then-new law against
patient dumping which specifies that hospitals must treat patients
in medical emergencies or in active labor.
   Burditt said he would choose his patients until DeTar, a private
hospital, paid his malpractice premiums.
   Mrs. Rivera bore a healthy 6-pound baby boy in the ambulance
parked on the roadside 40 miles east of Victoria.

<NOTE>GAO Criticizes Desert Management</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Bureau of Land Management has let
commercial and recreational interests take priority over the
protection of wildlife in the California Desert, government
auditors say.
   The General Accounting Office said in a report released Sunday
that while there has been a shortage of money to develop wildlife
protection plans, ``even if more funds were available ... BLM has
not demonstrated the willingness to take actions necessary to
protect wildlife interests.''
   For example, the GAO said, the bureau has permitted motorcycle
races and established ``free play'' areas for off-highway vehicles
in areas important to the desert tortoise, has allowed livestock
grazing that is harmful to some species, and has placed
insufficient restrictions on mining operations.
   ``BLM has frequently allowed the needs of competing interests,
such as recreation and commercial use, to take precedence over
wildlife interests when conflicts arise,'' the GAO said.
   It said data on the desert tortoise _ an important gauge for the
health of habitat for other species in the desert_ ``indicate that
the effects are not favorable.''
   ``Desert tortoise numbers have decreased dramatically in recent
years, and according to tortoise experts, the species may now be
sliding irreversibly toward extinction,'' the GAO said.

<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, picked to help lead a new
opposition coalition in the Soviet Congress, says the nation's
``empire-like'' structure must be dismantled to end a wave of
ethnic unrest.
   Sakharov and populist Boris N. Yeltsin were among five lawmakers
chosen Sunday to lead a 390-member faction in the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies. It is the first Soviet opposition
coalition in 70 years.
   Yeltsin, a former alternate member of the ruling Politburo who
has remade himself into a populist reformer, won the most votes
among 13 candidates for the five-member governing board of the
Inter-regional Deputies' Group.
   The group gave itself the bland name in part to allay suspicions
it is an opposition party in a country where the Communist Party
has been the only legal party since the early 1920s.
   On Sunday, when the group was to work out its program, it
managed to agree only on calls for several parliamentary
commissions.
   They include commissions to investigate responsibility for the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and to study ethnic unrest in
the republic of Uzbekistan in December 1986.
   In an interview published Sunday in the weekly Ogonyok magazine,
Sakharov reiterated his respect for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
but said the country is on the verge of economic catastrophe and
that he considers a military or right-wing coup a possibility.
   Sakharov said the Soviet Union must tear down the centrally
controlled system built by Josef Stalin and start all over again.
   ``Our starting point is a forced, empire-like structure and we
cannot dismantle it partially. It has to be done completely and
reassemble the pieces into a whole new structure,'' the popular
weekly quoted him as saying.
   The 15 Soviet republics and other homelands set aside for the
Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups ``should get
independence to the maximum degree,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying.
   ``Their sovereignty should have the minimal limits of common
defense, foreign policy, transport and communications,'' he added.
   About 390 Congress deputies, including most of the best-known
political and economic reformers, have joined the new group. About
260 of them took part in a two-day meeting that ended Sunday, but
by Sunday afternoon just 155 were around to take part in the voting.
   Yeltsin received 144 votes for the governing board, followed by
historian Yuri Afanasyev with 143, economist Gavriil Popov with
132, scholar Viktor Palm from Estonia with 73 and Sakharov, human
rights activist and winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, with 69.
   Yeltsin said he did not forsee the group eventually becoming a
majority in the Congress, which was elected this spring in the
country's first contested elections in seven decades.
   He said the group ``was created for the protection of the
minority,'' adding that ``the minority is now organized and solid
enough, and we will help fight for each other's positions.''
   The group unveiled its own newspaper, The People's Deputy, at
the gathering. The paper said the group grew out of ``the despair
of the radically inclined minority'' at the conservative views of
the majority of Congress members.
   The official Tass news agency said Saturday that the group was
made up of ``left-radicals,'' but that they still could work within
the system. On Sunday, it quoted one deputy, Alexander Gelman, as
saying radical approaches were necessary to reform the Soviet
system.
   ``Radicalism of the deputies assembled here is nothing other
than realism,'' Tass quoted Gelman as saying.

<HEAD>Clinic Denies Abortions to Some Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY MUTCHLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clinic that is denying or delaying
abortions for women who don't agree with its pro-choice philosophy
has aroused the ire of some feminists but praise from others who
say it exposes double standards.
   At least two women seeking abortions initially were turned away
from the Allentown Women's Center because they did not believe
abortion should be legal. Both women eventually were given
abortions. One had changed her mind, and the second woman agreed
not to make negative comments about her abortion.
   The clinic also demands that women sign a document in which they
waive their right to confidentiality if they declare they were
exploited by the experience.
   ``If a woman tells us she does not think abortion should be
legal .. we tell her we cannot provide an abortion for her,'' said
Sylvia Stengle, the clinic director. ``When they find themselves in
that position, they have a moral change or think they are a special
case. We send them away to think about it.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said the policy contradicts the premise of choice.
   ``It seems to me (women) have a constitutional right and that's
what our whole pro-choice movement is based on,'' Ms. Yard said.
``Why are they even asking that question? I've never heard of such
a thing.''
   David J. Andrews, executive vice president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, faulted the clinic for acting
like its anti-abortion counterparts.
   ``To hold (women) hostage because of any political belief is
reprehensible,'' Andrews said. ``To create a litmus test as a
requirement to their clinic is really resorting to our opponents'
way of doing things.''
   Ms. Stengle and other clinic directors said it's frustrating to
deal with women who believe abortion is wrong but insist on their
narrow right to the procedure.
   Myra South, of the Missouri chapter of the National Organization
for Women, said she was ``delighted'' with Ms. Stengle for exposing
hypocrisy.
   ``They want to come through the back door. They think they are
better than some women,'' she said.
   Dr. Robert Blomberg, regional director of Planned Parenthood for
15 western states, said providing health care should supercede
political divisiveness.
   Ideally, a woman requesting an abortion would respect other
women's rights, but ``I would hope that's not a litmus test for
providing care,'' he said.
   Ms. Stengle said abortion rights are in political jeopardy, so
it's hard for her staff to be supportive of anti-abortion patients.
   She said 15 of every 100 patients are opposed to abortion. One
in every hundred believes that the procedure should not be legal,
she said.
   Sue Roselle, executive director of Women's Health Services in
Pittsburgh, said she also agrees with Ms. Stengle's policy. She
said there are cases in which anti-abortionists go to clinics for
abortions and afterward ``will be right back on the picket line.''
   ``Why do we have to serve everybody that comes to our door? We
have freedom of choice as providers,'' she said.

<HEAD>Attorney Suggests Immunity for Bloch to Assess Damage</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Recasts lead; adds Pollard reference in 3rd graf; corrects spelling
of Levchenko in 14th graf. `diGenova' is CQ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The government should offer suspected Soviet
spy Felix S. Bloch immunity to get him to reveal what secrets he
divulged rather than try to arrest him, a former prosecutor says.
   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said Sunday, ``Even in the
best of circumstances, espionage cases are very difficult to make
in the area of what has been referred to as the `wilderness of
mirrors.'''
   ``You try to get them to disgorge enough information to confirm
what you already have and then use that for leads,'' diGenova, who
prosecuted the Jonathan Pollard spy case several years ago, said on
ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   But most accounts indicate that Bloch, a 30-year State
Department veteran, has been reluctant to reveal why he reportedly
was seen passing a briefcase to a Soviet KGB agent a few months ago
in Paris.
   Bloch, 54, has not been charged with any crime but has been
under 24-hour surveillance by the FBI.
   Sources have said Bloch was recruited by the Soviets when he
served at the newly opened U.S. Embassy in East Berlin in 1974. He
later served at the U.S. Embassy in Austria, long a hotbed for
East-West espionage activities, from 1980 to 1987.
   Bloch, whose State Department access has been suspended,
reportedly admitted to having taken money from the KGB.
   French newspapers this weekend reported that Bloch was filmed by
French agents at the beginning of this year passing a briefcase to
a KGB agent involved in circumventing a ban on the sale of high
technology to the Soviets.
   The weekly Journal du Dimanche reported Sunday that the man with
Bloch in the film was a member of the Soviet diplomatic mission to
UNESCO. But, the newspaper said, the Soviet diplomat actually was a
spy working for a new KGB service known as Agency 4, charged with
stealing sensitive technology secrets.
   DiGenova said the United States should offer Bloch immunity,
bring him before a grand jury and threaten him with an 18-month
prison term for contempt of court if he fails to answer the
questions.
   Several administration sources have suggested that any
admissions made by Bloch to the FBI or State Department
investigators fell well short of the legal requirements for arrest.
The focus now, according to diGenova, must center on learning what
has been revealed to Soviet agents.
   One of the pressing questions to which diGenova said a response
is needed is how word of the U.S. investigation of Bloch was leaked
and whether there are Soviet ``moles'' inside the government.
According to sources, the Soviets contacted the diplomat and told
him he was under investigation.
   ``That is a very dangerous and concerning revelation, that he
was warned by his KGB handler after the United States government
had begun its investigation,'' diGenova said.
   Stanislav Levchenko, a former KGB officer, said: ``It is not
impossible at all that at some level there can be one, two, three
other assets of the Soviets who one way or another learned about
this investigation and tipped him off.''
   Sen. David L. Boren, chairman of the Senate's intelligence
committee, said lessons should be learned from the Bloch case
because such incidents are inevitable.
   ``Most people think that we have glasnost, we have arms control
negotiations going on, the problem is over. We're having a much
better relationship with the Soviet Union,'' the Oklahoma Democrat
said on ABC. ``It's ironic, ... as Star Wars winds down, spy wars
are heating up.
   ``And it makes sense. As military budgets are being cut, for
example, in the Soviet Union, they are desperate to get
technology.''

<HEAD>Constitutional Reforms Ending Ban on Marxism, Political Exile, Win
Approval</HEAD>

   The government and opposition both say
the voters' decision to approve a package of far-reaching
constitutional reforms will help revive democracy after 16 years of
military rule.
   But the opposition is promising to push for more reforms,
including a clause that would prevent Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
continuing to run the army after he steps down as president next
year.
   The 54 reforms approved Sunday included amendments that would
lift a ban on Marxist activities, end political exile and reduce
the powers of the president.
   The government said the final tally was 5,735,032 votes in favor
and 550,888 against, meaning 85.7 percent of the voters approved of
the amendments. Void and blank votes totaled 408,868.
   Government officials and opposition leaders said approval of the
54 reforms, which were the result of an unprecedented agreement
between the military regime and its foes, should help stabilize the
political system.
   Pinochet, in a speech on national radio and television late
Sunday, called the vote ``historic'' and said the amended
constitution is ``the most efficient way to consolidate an
authentically democratic system.''
   Opposition leaders, while insisting that further reforms are
needed, praised those passed Sunday as a step toward the
restoration of full democracy.
   Patricio Aylwin, the opposition candidate to succeed Pinochet in
national elections set for Dec. 14, said ``the reforms will make
the task easier for the future government to rebuild democracy, and
will aid to the reconciliation among Chileans.''
   Aylwin, favored by most opinion polls to win the election, said
Sunday's vote also showed ``that the people want agreement among
Chileans rather than confrontation,'' a reference to the fact that
the reforms were agreed upon by the government and the opposition.
   Aylwin and other opposition leaders said they would seek other
constitutional changes after voters choose a new congress in the
Dec. 14 elections. The new government would take office March 11.
   One of the main changes approved Sunday would make it easier for
congress to effect further constitutional reforms, which could aid
the opposition plans.
   Pinochet, however, has made clear he is not prepared to easily
allow more changes to the constitution, which was written by his
military regime.
   In his speech Sunday night, he warned that he and the armed
forces have ``vowed in a solemn manner'' to ensure that the
constitution will be respected.
   Pinochet, 73, has ruled since a bloody 1973 military coup
overthrew elected President Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Pinochet
agreed to amend the constitution only after voters in October
rejected a proposal by the military to extend his rule until 1997.
   Despite losing that referendum, Pinochet will retain a decisive
influence after stepping down from the presidency in March. The
constitution allows him to retain command of the 60,000-men army,
the basis of his power since the 1973 coup, and the general has
said he intends to hold on to the post.
   Opposition members had hoped to include an amendment on Sunday
that would eliminate that provision, but the government refused.
Some Pinochet followers saw the approval of the amendments as a
vote of support.
   Hernan Buchi, the pro-government presidential hopeful, said the
vote ``should be a sample of our behavior in the future, because it
has shown our capacity to reach agreements to advance toward
democracy.''
   The principal amendments approved on Sunday include eliminating
a president's authority to send citizens into exile and dissolve
the lower house of congress.
   They also eased restrictions on Marxist activity, which was
banned under the original constitutional. The changes are to take
effect within 15 days, Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said.
   There was relatively little voter interest in the referendum
because its terms had been agreed upon in advance by the government
and its foes, but voter turnout was high because voting is
mandatory in this South American nation of 13 million people.
Citizens who fail to cast a ballot may be fined.

<HEAD>Dollar Dives, Stocks Bounce Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index bounced back
from last Friday's losses and closed at a new high today, while the
dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 248.24 points, or 0.72
percent, closing at 34,953.87. It had declined by 79.65 points last
Friday.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer at Nikko Securities, said the
index climbed on the yen's sharp rise against the dollar and
expectations for lower interest rates.
   ``Economic factors, such as the exchange rate, are becoming
favorable for stock investment, but trading was directionless and
volume was small, mainly because of political uncertainties,'' he
said.
   First section volume was estimated at 500 million shares. Among
gainers were Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and electrical
issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 138.40 yen, down 1.05
yen from last Friday's close of 139.45 yen. After opening at 138.90
yen, the dollar ranged between 138.15 yen and 139.10 yen.
   Takamasa Yamasaki, a senior trader with Daiwa Bank, said,
``Investors had bought the dollar despite the downtrend in the U.S.
interest rate ... and now they are selling back the excess dollars
they bought.''
   ``Market players are trying to make the dollar go lower than the
138-yen level,'' he added. ``If it breaks that (138-yen) line and
falls further, it would keep falling to as low as 133 yen or so.''

   A gunman was barricaded in his house today after
shooting up a police car and firing on a passing helicopter in
response to an effort by authorities to arrest him on an attempted
murder charge.
   ``He's shooting periodically and randomly,'' said police
spokesman Sgt. George Anthony. ``He's well armed. The situation is
extremely dangerous.''
   The incident began in northeast Detroit about 9:45 p.m. Sunday,
when the gunman opened fire on police from the neighboring city of
Highland Park who had arrived at his house to serve the warrant,
Anthony said.
   The gunman, whose name was not being disclosed, later fired many
rounds into a Detroit police car that responded to the shooting.
There were no injuries, Anthony said.
   Police sealed off the area and evacuated several dozen
neighborhood residents.
   The gunman also took shots at a police helicopter hovering over
his home, officials said.
   Police could not immediately provide details on the warrant that
set off the episode.

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people were not born to live in a socialist
system. Miguel is one of them.
   Miguel, not his real name, is an educated man in his late 50's
who has lived in uneasy intimacy with Fidel Castro's revolution for
three decades. He doesn't seem to belong.
   Known as a dissident, although a harmless one, Miguel works as a
guard, receiving the lowest salary he says the law permits _ 100
pesos a month.
   His diet is mind-numbing in its lack of variety although it is
not clear whether the problem is more the result of apathy or
scarcity. He has one meal a day consisting almost always of two or
more fried eggs and a scoop of rice.
   Asked why he is not slim, Miguel says his normal weight is 250
pounds so that, for him, 215 pounds is ``skinny.''
   He is asked why his diet is so limited. He invites his
questioner to inspect a bakery a block away. The shelves are empty
but there is a promise of bread in two hours. He suggests the
promise may be as empty as the shelves.
   What about fruits or vegetables? With a wave of the hand, he
suggests that these are occasionally available but often arrive at
the market too rotten to eat.
   To fight hunger, Miguel smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. That
means one-third of his income goes up in smoke.
   He is part of a subculture here which looks on the revolution
with disdain. Every country has an unassimilable subculture, and
Cuba is no exception.
   Miguel has been at the bottom of the heap for some time. But
Cuban officials point out that people like Miguel at least have a
job, a place to live, food on the table and access to medical care.
   This, indeed, is what sets Cuba apart. Cuba guarantees a minimal
living standard for its people; most other countries don't come
close to that ideal.
   There are tens of millions elsewhere in Latin America who don't
live nearly as well as Miguel. But the psychic pain he suffers is
great because, before the revolution, he once commanded respect as
an educated professional who used to enjoy the good life _
restaurants, nightclubs, the theater.
   The government has pegged him as ideologically unreliable so he
is condemned to his mundane, unchallenging existence. He can't get
permission to leave the country.
   A walk with Miguel through the streets of Havana elicits from
him unbridled criticism of what Castro's revolution has wrought.
   He whines about street crime, smoke-belching buses, crumbling
buildings, the absence of places to buy even a soft drink, the long
lines for public transportation, the political repression.
   To underscore the country's housing shortage, he points out a
unique Cuban institution called a ``posada.'' That is where lovers,
usually young and with no access to privacy at home, can spend some
quiet time together in a no-frills room.
   Continuing his stroll through the city, Miguel wistfully recalls
when Havana was a lovely, modern capital. It is now terribly
rundown.
   The revolution has indeed shown little concern for maintaining
the splendor, albeit defective, of mid-century Havana. Attention
has been focused instead on the countryside, so woefully neglected
by Castro's rightist predecessors.
   Countless numbers suffered appalling deprivation, with little
hope of a decent job, schooling or medical care. A quarter of the
Cuban population was illiterate.
   Castro visited Camaguey province 300 miles east of here this
past week and ticked off the long list of advances in almost every
economic and social category since the revolution. The list sounds
impressive.
   And, according to some U.S. estimates, over one-third of all
Cubans live better than they did before the revolution.
   Even after 30 years, Castro's appearance generates emotional
responses. Many Cubans still sense that ``Fidel,'' as they call
him, is no ordinary mortal.
   But the day before Castro spoke, there was evidence that
shortages extend well beyond Havana.
   Long lines of shoppers were seen all over Camaguey. At one
store, several hundred people waited for hours to buy tins of a
European import roughly equivalent to Spam. The price was 3 pesos,
or about $3.75, for a 4-ounce can. The average wage in Cuba is
little over a peso an hour.
   To the extent there are hardships, the average Cuban confronts
them with grace and humor.
   And to Castro, the alternative is the ``egotistical, brutal and
inhumane'' capitalist system, as he said last Wednesday. Don't tell
that to Miguel.

<HEAD>Town with Dozen Residents Battles Mining Company in David-Goliath
Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dozen or so residents of an 1870s Nevada
boomtown, calling themselves Davids to a small mining company's
Goliath, are fighting for their homes _ and town _ as the company
moves to level buildings in a gold hunt.
   Homeowners in Tuscarora, a flyspeck on the map 250 miles
northeast of Reno, have been told ``we are nothing more than
squatters,'' Richard Schupbach said at a news conference last week.
   ``The people out there are being run roughshod over simply
because there's only a handful of people,'' said environmentalist
Bob Fulkerson. ``This is a classic David and Goliath issue.''
   Bob Jones, of Horizon Gold Shares of Denver, called it ``a David
vs. David battle.''
   The company, which has about 100 employees, plans to dig a pit
mine that would consume half the community.
   ``The problem is, it's a town and we can't move,'' Schupbach
said. ``And once they mine it, it will be gone, and gone forever.''
   The dozen year-round residents and two dozen homeowners are
asking the Elko County Commission to grant historic status to
buildings in the community, which would give them some protection
from development plans.
   In the 1870s the northeastern Nevada community had 4,000
residents, drawn by the historic Dexter Mine.
   The commission plans to meet Aug. 15 in Tuscarora to discuss the
proposal.
   Under state law, mining companies can condemn property. But
Horizon President John Watson has said the company would use
eminent domain only as a last resort.
   Jones, general manager of the mining operation, said in a
telephone interview from Tuscarora the company has invested $8
million in the operation and has offered to buy out homeowners,
even though it owns the land. Top price for the homes is $50,000,
he said.
   Jones said Horizon plans to file legal papers in August to take
over the land.
   ``We think the residents are overreacting,'' Jones said. ``They
are on privately-owned land _ ours. We're not even sure they have
anything to sell. Basically, they have very little legal ground to
stand on. ... Most of them came in the 1960s and kind of squatted
here.''
   Residents disagree. Many said they have legal documentation to
prove they own the buildings.
   Fulkerson, executive director of Citizen Alert, an environmental
group, said Horizon Gold Shares came to Tuscarora in 1987 ``to
rape, pillage and plunder'' by digging a 400-by-800 foot wide,
150-foot deep open pit mine just south of the town.
   Residents complain that the mining exploratory work has cracked
home foundations and caused other damage.
   Elko County Manager George Boucher said Tuscarora homeowners are
at the mercy of the mining company because the town does not have a
legal status. ``When Tuscarora was created, somebody forgot to file
the map.''
   But Fulkerson said residents have always paid property taxes to
the county, establishing Tuscarora as a real town.
   Schupbach, a Stanford University professor, said he plans to
retire to ghost-town life in Tuscarora _ ``if the town still
exists.''
   Another resident, Dennis Parks, moved to Tuscarora in 1966 to
start a pottery school. Now he wonders if he'll be moving out soon.
   ``It seemed like a safe place to live,'' he lamented. ``It
certainly looked like all industrial activity was in the past.''

   Two small airplanes collided only moments
after one had dropped parachutists at a hot air balloon festival,
and all seven people aboard the planes were killed, authorities
said.
   One person on the ground was injured slightly from falling
debris, officials said.
   ``They were flying one over the other, then one flew up and hit
the other,'' said Frank Kosh, a witness.
   The planes collided Sunday over a shopping mall about a mile
southwest of the Queen City Airport, which was hosting the balloon
festival, said Bill Vogel, area supervisor for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the plane that carried the
parachutists crashed near the mall with its left wing missing.
   Airport spokeswoman Joan Wildman identified the craft as a
Cessna 182. The other plane was a Beechcraft Bonanza, according to
officials.
   The Beechcraft crashed at a car dealership across the street,
officials said.
   Vogel declined to speculate on how the 1:34 p.m. crash occurred.
   One man on the ground suffered minor injuries when his car was
struck by debris, but he did not require hospitalization, police
said.
   Kosh said the plane at the dealership ``was all in pieces. The
pilot was in the flames burning.''
   The plane destroyed one car and damaged another, Salisbury
police officer Brian Klimowicz said.
   The planes collided as they were returning to the airport,
Klimowicz said. He said the Cessna had just dropped two
parachutists and was returning to the airport. The parachutists
landed safely, officials said.
   ``For some unknown reason, it appeared that the Cessna just
continued to bank and struck the Beechcraft,'' he said.
   Lehigh County Coroner Wayne Snyder identified the Cessna 182
pilot as 47-year-old Peter C. Miller. He was the only person aboard
the Cessna.
   The Beechcraft pilot was identified as Dr. Abdul Kahn, 43. Also
on board were Dr. Muhammad A. Malik, 45, and his 12-year-old son,
Raymond Malik, Snyder said.
   Malik was the head of a trauma team at the Lehigh Valley
Hospital Center.
   The two doctors recently bought the Beechcraft and were ``up on
a check-out flight with an instructor and were heading toward the
airport,'' Snyder said.
   Continental Airlines pilot and flight instructor Stephen Remo,
42, his wife, Kathleen, and their 3-year-old daughter, Alicia, also
died in the Beechcraft. Snyder said he did not know Mrs. Remo's age.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the planes had been
flying at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,000 feet.
   Airport spokeswoman Lori Remaley said the balloon festival,
which ran from Friday to Sunday, involved 40 to 45 hot-air
balloons. No balloons were in the air at the time of the collision,
she said.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Arrives In San Diego For Repairs, Possible Name Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The crippled tanker Exxon Valdez arrived in San
Diego Bay for repairs and possibly a name change four months after
its disastrous oil spill fouled Alaskan waters and miles of
coastline.
   ``Everything went like clockwork. It was a piece of cake,'' said
Capt. Edward J. Silva Jr., the senior harbor pilot who brought the
Valdez in Sunday.
   Tugboats nudged the ship to a pier at the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job, ending a
2,500-mile trek from Prince William Sound.
   The docking closed a chapter in a grim environmental saga that
began when the 970-foot ship rammed Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince
William Sound on March 24.
   The hull tore open and about 11 million gallons of crude gushed
into the sound. Thousands of animals were killed and miles of
coastline were stained. The cleanup continues.
   When an 18-mile oil slick coincided with the Valdez's arrival
off California on July 10, the Coast Guard barred the ship from the
harbor.
   Tests from slick samples revealed degraded North Slope Alaskan
crude and concentrations of marine organisms that inhabited the
shredded cargo tanks.
   Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said no further discharges were
spotted Sunday.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi continued to deny the
Valdez was responsible for the earlier slick and at least two
others off the coast, as charged by state Department of Fish and
Game officials.
   ``There was no oil on that ship. People are losing sight of that
fact,'' he said.
   Reed Smith, a Fish and Game department response coordinator,
said he was not impressed with the denial.
   ``How do you discuss with him how to prevent more oil spills
when he's not admitting he had one at all?'' Smith said.
   Hundreds of people watched from shore as the Valdez entered the
bay and rounded North Island, sailing past waterfront hotels and
Navy warships.
   Coast Guard and Harbor Patrol boats guarded a security zone
around the tanker. Ships with pollution containment and salvage
equipment followed.
   Greenpeace boats shadowed the vessel. Activist Kelly Quirke said
Greenpeace was protesting ``a fossil-fuel energy policy that is not
only destroying the ocean but the atmosphere.''
   The Valdez will be moved to dry dock after an underwater survey
of damage. Iarossi said 30 percent of the hull is either gone or
cannot rest on the blocks that usually hold up a vessel in dry dock.
   Iarossi also disclosed that Exxon may try to remove the stigma
from the ship by changing its name.
   ``Rechristening wouldn't be in order, but we are considering
whether we should start a new career for the vessel with a new
name,'' he said.
   The repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard, which expects
to add 300 people and boost its work force to 3,000.
   Ship's Capt. Tom Hill said that getting the crippled vessel into
port was accomplishment enough.
   ``We did everything humanly possible to save this ship without
impacting the environment,'' he said.
   Under an agreement with state agencies, the Valdez had to be
leak-free for 24 hours prior to entry and accompanied by a

   A world champion rodeo rider was gored to
death by a charging bull that rammed him after he had turned his
back.
   Lane Frost, 25, of Quanah, Texas, died Sunday from a ruptured
blood vessel he suffered when his ribs were broken in the attack,
said Laramie County Coroner Roger Radomsky.
   ``Frost was a favorite with cowboys, spectators and the media,''
said a news release from the Cheyenee Frontier Days event.
   Spectators said Frost, the 1987 world champion bull rider, was
thrown clear from the bull called K. Walsh, but the animal charged
him as he walked away.
   Onlookers say the cowboy stumbled, signaled for help, collapsed
and appeared to lose consciousness.
   Roy Cooper, who won the all-around cowboy award at Frontier Days
on Sunday, said that instead of celebrating he was praying.
   The crowd was not aware of how seriously Frost had been injured
when he was removed from the pen, after winning an 83 score for his
ride on the bull.

   Fourteen-year-old Adam Logan says he doesn't
remember when he first learned to play Scrabble or how he got so
good at it.
   ``I just know that it's fun,'' he said during a break after
Sunday's first game of the 1989 National Scrabble Championship.
   Logan, a high school student from Ottawa, is the youngest of the
151 expert players competing in a five-day tournament for the
$5,000 top prize. Another 72 recreation-level players also are
competing at the New York Penta hotel in midtown Manhattan.
   The competitors are from 30 states and eight other countries.
   The 1987 champion, Rita Norr of New York City, is the only woman
to win the 7-year-old tournament.
   ``Some people feel that the women don't have the killer
instinct,'' she said. ``I'm not sure that that's really it. Men
maybe have the freedom to concentrate more on the game.''
   Norr, a freelance mathematics textbook writer with a computer
science background, said the game is more than knowledge of words.
   ``It's very mathematical,'' she said. ``A lot of it's even
spatial relationships and decisions about when to challenge, when
not to challenge, when to close the board, when to open it,
constantly keeping track of where you are in the game and how many
tiles are left.''
   But Loera Thompson, a 75-year-old Mississippi native, doesn't
take it so seriously.
   ``I don't care that much about it,'' she said _ as long as she
isn't outpointed. ``I like to win, of course.''

   He's been laughed at for using Jimminy
Cricket's droppings for fertilizer, but Bill Bricker gets the last
laugh when he hoists his three-pound tomatoes to promote his
Kricket Krap.
   The retired Army colonel invents organic fertilizers like
Kricket Krap, which he sells from his 10-acre farm along the
Savannah River near Augusta.
   ``It's what the name says _ cricket droppings,'' Bricker said.
``I don't know why people never thought of it before. Crickets eat
25 percent protein _ that's better than you or I eat.''
   Once a month, Bricker buys about six tons of droppings from two
local cricket farms, where the insects are raised as bait and their
droppings collected with a huge vacuum cleaner.
   He bags the droppings and sells them around the country via his
mail order service.
   Bricker said he also wants to educate the South about the values
of organic farming. But it's also a million-dollar business, and he
goes to great lengths for a sale.
   His first fertilizer was a combination of leaves, hay and old
vegetables baked in the sun. When it sold poorly, he televised an
ad that showed an egg cooking in a plastic bag in the middle of the
compost pile.
   Then, he ate the egg.

<HEAD>Restarting Tritium Reactors To Cost Four Times Estimate; Restart
Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Repairs to the government's three
tritium-producing nuclear reactors will take longer and will cost
more than four times the previous estimate, a newspaper reported
today.
   In December, the Energy Department estimated that repairs at the
Savannah River Site in South Carolina would cost $350 million and
be completed in 1990.
   But a confidential report submitted to the department on June 26
by the Westinghouse Savannah River Co. said the project will cost
at least $1.66 billion and won't be completed until 1991, The New
York Times reported.
   The complex's three reactors are the nation's sole source of
tritium, a short-lived radioactive gas essential for many nuclear
weapons. Because tritium decays to inert helium, the tritium charge
must be renewed from time to time.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins planned to announce on Tuesday
a five-year plan to bring all of the nation's nuclear weapons
production plants into compliance with environmental and safety
laws, The Washington Post reported today.
   Under the proposal, the department would spend $2.4 billion next
year and up to $3.7 billion in each of the following four years.
Watkins told the Post the plan would include management of
hazardous waste and restoration of the environment around the
plants.
   The three reactors at Savannah River have been shut for more
than a year because of safety and management concerns. During the
shutdown, the previous contractor, Du Pont Corp., withdrew and the
government hired the Westinghouse Electric Corp. subsidiary to
operate the plant.
   The Energy Department pays for operation of the plant, and the
additional money will come from the department's budget.
   The confidential report calls for restarting the first reactor
in September 1990, the second in December 1990 and the third in
February 1991, the Times said.
   Jack Herrmann, spokesman for Westinghouse Savannah River, said
the company has submitted plans to the department proposing a
timetable and cost estimates for restarting the reactors.
   The plans, he said, present ``a number of variables and a number
of options. At this point, it's an interim process with DOE. We're
not really in a position to comment because there's a lot of give
and take in this process.''
   Westinghouse presented a restart plan for the idled K-reactor to
the department on June 26 and supplemental plans for restarting the
other two reactors on July 10, Herrmann said.
   Herrmann said the department and Westinghouse have held
discussions about the plans ``off and on the last several weeks''
but there has not been a formal resolution.
   Experts with the Energy Department told the Times that
recovering tritium will not be possible until nine months after a
reactor has been turned on.
   This means that the first new supplies will not be available
until June 1991. Defense officials have said some weapons might
have to be cannibalized to keep other weapons in service if tritium
production isn't restarted soon.
   In addition, the plan calls for operating the reactors at half
their potential power because of concerns about the ability of
their emergency cooling systems to withstand accidents, the Times
said.
   In a letter accompanying the plan, James S. Moore, president of
Westinghouse Savannah River, said the delay and extra cost were a
result of initial difficulties engineers had in understanding the
``magnitude of the changes'' needed to make the reactors safe,
according to the Times.

<HEAD>New Jersey Woman Survives 14 Days On Dinghy After Sailboat Sinks
In Ocean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman rescued after 14 days in a life raft in
the Atlantic was trying to decide on a sailboat trip to Bermuda
whether to marry her sailing partner. But authorities say he did
not survive the ordeal.
   The 37-foot sailboat Anaulis sank on July 16 as it carried Janet
Culver, 48, of Passaic, N.J., and Nicholas Abbott, 50, toward New
York from Bermuda, said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Matthew Wannamaker.
   The pair climbed into an inflatable dinghy and waited for help.
On Wednesday, a fatigued Abbott climbed out of the raft without a
life jacket and swam off, Wannamaker said.
   ``He seemed disillusioned, maybe even slightly deranged,
according to Ms. Culver,'' he said.
   Ms. Culver was rescued by a U.S. research vessel early Sunday,
450 miles southeast of New York or about halfway between the city
and Bermuda, and was transported to the Royal Viking Star, a cruise
ship with full medical facilities.
   Ms. Culver's mother, Hannah Culver, said the trip was the first
major sailing venture for her daughter, a legal secretary.
   She said Abbott had asked her daughter to marry him, but she did
not want to agree until she determined whether she liked long
sailing trips.
   Abbott, a professional boat transporter, lived for the seas and
spent his summers aboard a boat docked a New York yacht club,
friends said.
   ``She wasn't sure she could survive sailing. She gets seasick.
She said, `If I can't take it, I don't want to hold him back,'''
Mrs. Culver recalled.
   Wannamaker said the Coast Guard did not yet know what caused the
sailboat to sink; Coast Guard Lt. Mike Fijalka said there were no
major storms in the area where the boat went down.
   Ms. Culver was in stable condition suffering from exhaustion,
exposure and sunburn but was sleeping and doing well, Wannamaker
said.
   The Coast Guard had been searching for the pair since July 23.
   The search for Abbott was suspended Sunday and he was presumed
drowned.
   ``He's been in the water four days, did not have a life
preserver and was observed to have slumped over by Ms. Culver,''
Wannamaker said.
   ``I can't believe she was 14 days on that raft. How did she
live?'' said Mrs. Culver.
   She said she had been comforted Friday night by a dream that her
daughter was all right.
   The good news came by telephone from the Coast Guard Sunday
morning, but it was tinged with sadness that Abbott was gone.
   ``I feel so badly because I know him and he's a nice fella,''
Mrs. Culver said. ``It's terrible.''

<HEAD>Scientists Calls For More Chernobyl Evacuations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say 106,000 people, nearly 10 times the
number recommended by the government, should be evacuated from
their villages because of contamination from the Chernobyl nuclear
plant disaster, Tass reported.
   The Supreme Soviet, or legislature, in the republic of
Byelorussia on Friday tentatively approved legislation that calls
for resettling 11,000 people during the next five years, the Soviet
news agency said.
   ``Special attention will be paid to children from areas affected
by Chernobyl fallout,'' Tass said.
   But during the debate, delegates to the national Congress of
People's Deputies attending the session and scientists from
Byelorussia proposed more sweeping measures _ including the
evacuation of 106,000 people, Tass said Saturday.
   The April 26, 1986, accident at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine killed two
workers immediately in the world's worst atomic accident. Hundreds
were hospitalized, including 31 who later died from
radiation-related injuries.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries. More than 130,000 people were evacauted after
the accident.
   The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine capital of Kiev.
Byelorussia is north of the Ukraine and was in the main path of the
fallout from the accident.
   The government evacuation program for Byelorussia is based on
people who are at risk of being exposed to 35 rems during a
lifetime. A rem is the standard unit of measurement for the amount
of radiation absorbed by living tissue.
   Thirty-five rems is 35,000 millirems. The typical diagnostic
chest X-ray involves between 20 millirems and 30 millirems of
radiation.
   The legislators and scientists recommended that normal living
conditions be made the criteria rather than a ceiling on the
cumulative number of rems.
   ``The most controversy was caused by the list of villages whose
residents need to be resettled to radioactive-free territories,''
Tass said.
   Tass said they realized that, at a cost of $15.6 billion, their
proposals could not be realistically handled by the republic's
budget. But, Tass said, ``they feel that Chernobyl is a disaster of
the whole country, so the whole country must participate in curing
the wounds.''
   However, the original proposal to resettle 11,000 was adopted on
the first reading and a standing commission was given the
assignment of reviewing it and submitting it to the Byelorussian
people for discussion, Tass said.
   The proposed evacuation includes 12 districts with more than 500
villages, in the Gomel and Mogilev regions, about 100 miles
northest of the Chernobyl disaster site.

Plains and Rockies.
   Thunderstorms on Sunday produced wind gusts near 60 mph at
Abilene, Kan., and Great Falls, Mont., and gusts of about 80 mph
were recorded at Lewiston, Mont. Winds caused some damage in parts
of South Carolina.
   Flooding of small streams was widespread in northeast Colorado
and several roads were washed out, including Highway 6 near Paoli.
   Heavy rain also caused flooding of a highway between Almena and
Cavert, Kan.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT included
just under 2 inches at Meridian, Miss., 1.65 inches at Memphis,
Tenn., and 1.13 inches at Columbia, S.C.

Coast from southeast New York state to Georgia, in southern Ohio
and West Virginia, in the central Gulf Coast states, from Arkansas
to Nebraska, in parts of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle,
northwest New Mexico, central Arizona, northwest Oregon and
southwest Washington.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern New Jersey and southern Pennsylvania across North
Carolina, from the Ohio Valley across the Tennessee Valley, central
and southern Missouri, much of Louisiana, Mississippi, western and
southern Alabama, Florida's Panhandle and Gulf Coast, northern
Colorado, central and northern Arizona, southwest Montana, and from

   Thomas Root, the lawyer who made a
mysterious 800-mile flight and then crashed in the Atlantic, says
he's just a guy who passed out at the controls.
   Root, 36, was flying from Washington, D.C., to Rocky Mount,
N.C., on July 13 when he says he passed out. The plane flew on
autopilot until it ran out of gas and ditched off the Bahamas.
Doctors at Hollywood, Fla., hospital discovered a bullet wound in
Root's abdomen after the crash.
   Root, who said he can not explain the bullet wound, says the
crash generated a lot of ``hoopla.''
   ``People can't help but read all this stuff and ... think what
kind of criminal is this guy?'' he said in an interview Saturday
with radio station WSWR in Shelby, which he owns. ``My response is:
no kind of criminal, just a guy that was going to a deposition and
... something happened.''
   Root, who was interviewed at his parents' house in Plymouth, 50
miles southeast of Cleveland, where he has been recovering,
returned Saturday to his home in Arlington, Va.
   Although blood tests for carbon monoxide were negative, Root
said he believes a carbon dioxide buildup may have caused him to
black out during the flight.
   Root said he was unaware he had been shot until doctors at the
hospital told him. He said the loaded revolver he kept in the
plane's glove compartment may have gone off on impact _ a theory
the manufacturer of the .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson disputed.
   Root was sued in federal court in New Orleans last week by a
group of investors who allege he lost them $125,000 in 1987 by
misrepresenting them in a bid to obtain a Federal Communications
Commission license to build a radio station.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of two Christian denominations that
have entered into a working partnership say members will be
encouraged to worship together, but local congregations will
maintain their own identities.
   About 6,000 delegates to the Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ) General Assembly agreed Saturday to enter into full
communion, including mutual recognition of members and clergy, with
the United Church of Christ.
   The resolution means the two churches will recognize each
other's members as joint believers in a common faith and will make
an effort to coordinate their social services, missionary work and
community functions, said Paul Crow Jr., president of the Council
on Christian Unity.
   The United Church of Christ adopted a similar resolution at its
convention in Fort Worth, Texas, a month ago.
   The granting of full communion, Crow said, makes the two
churches ``brothers'' rather than ``cousins.''
   ``This is not a merger. It's not a uniting of the churches'
structure,'' Crow said at the convention which continues through
Wednesday. ``This is setting up a common acknowledgement of each
other.''
   Saturday's endorsement came despite criticism from some members
of the Christian Church that the United Church of Christ is too
liberal.
   The two churches base their faith on the same Christian
doctrine, Crow said. But they differ in some worship practices and
church policies, he said.
   For example, the United Church of Christ forbids churches from
considering sexual orientation in the hiring of ministers. That
means the church officially allows homosexuals to become ministers
and forbids member churches from discriminating against them.
   ``In putting our stamp of approval on this, we are putting our
stamp of approval on homosexuality,'' said Bethel Nason of Topeka,
Kansas.
   Another delegate, Mike Wolfe of Spearman, Texas, charged the
United Church of Christ is ``far to the left, both political and
ecumenically.''
   But Crow says the differences in social beliefs are as common
within the Christian Church as they are between the two
denominations.
   ``The Christian Church allows for unity in diversity, but that
diversity need not divide us,'' he said.
   The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was formed in 1832 as
part of an early frontier movement to unify Christians. The United
Church of Christ was formed in 1961 when the Evangelical and
Reformed Church merged with the Congregational Christian Churches.

<TEXT>
   The dollar slid in light trading in Europe today
following a spate of selling in Asian markets and a general lack of
interest in the U.S. currency. Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the early momentum toward a lower U.S. currency
began in East Asia, where a large sell order from a banking
institution prompted other selling.
   In a market thinned by summer vacations, even a moderate-sized
order can greatly influence exchange rates, said a West German
banker.
   Traders predicted the dollar would continue to trade in a
holding pattern between 1.8700 West German marks and 1.8800 marks.
   In London, the British pound rose to 1.6600 dollars from 1.6455
dollars late Friday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe compared with late
Friday:
   _1.8715 West German marks, down from 1.8845
   _1.6115 Swiss francs, down from 1.6180
   _6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3825
   _2.1130 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1240
   _1,346.50 Italian lire, down from 1,354.00
   _1.1825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1838
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before European markets
open, the dollar fell 1.05 yen to close at 138.40 Japanese yen.
Later, in London, the dollar fell to 137.80 yen.
   In London, gold opened at a bid price of $368.35 a troy ounce,
down from $369.20 bid late Friday. At mid-morning, London dealers
fixed a recommended price of $369.10.
   In Zurich, it fell to $368.50 bid, down from $369.75 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents an ounce to close at
$369.64.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.16 a troy
ounce from $5.14 bid late Friday.

   Authorities executed two men who allegedly killed
two people and stole guns while robbing a home during this spring's
pro-democracy protests, a report in the official media said.
   The government also said Communist Party committees met
nationwide during the weekend to discuss how to implement an
anti-corruption order. Ending official corruption was a key demand
of the pro-democracy movement.
   A brief report by the official Xinhua News Agency late Sunday
identified the executed men as Yu Chunting and Guo Zhenghua of the
central city of Wuhan.
   It said they killed a pregnant woman and a girl while robbing a
home during the ``turmoil'' of the student-led protests.
   The government has attempted to portray the protesters as common
criminals and has tried to link any non-political crimes committed
during the upheaval to the protesters in order to discredit them.
   It reported last week that four people convicted of robbery or
murder were sentenced to death in Beijing, and they also were said
to have ``taken advantage of'' the turmoil to commit their crimes.
   Dozens of executions have been reported nationwide since the
protests were crushed in June, but just 12 were of known
protesters. Hong Kong newspapers have reported that dozens more
protesters have been executed in secret.
   Executions in China are carried out with a bullet to the back of
the head.
   In other developments, the government promised today it would
honor contracts signed by two leading state-owned conglomerates
that are being shut down in an attack on corruption.
   The State Administration for Industry and Commerce said two
special teams were being formed to ``clear up the accounts'' of the
Kang Hua Development Corp., which is linked to senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's son, and the China Industry and Commmerce Economic
Development Corp.
   It said their contract would remain valid, but did not say how
these would be carried out while the companies' books are
undergoing close examination and their offices are being shut down.
   The Communist Party Politburo issued a sweeping order Friday to
shut down the companies and audit others as part of its most
serious attack yet on endemic corruption in the party and
government.
   It made no specific charges against Kang Hua and China Industry,
but Kang Hua was widely reported to have used its connection to a
charity run by Deng's son, Deng Pufang, to evade taxes.
   It also was reported engaged in profiteering of scarce goods,
and the government ordered several of its offices shut down last
year.
   Local party committees nationwide met over the weekend to
discuss ways of implementing the Politburo order, the People's
Daily said.
   Some were said to add further measures to the Politburo ban on
pleasure trips abroad, gift-giving and banquets at the state
expense, use of imported cars by high-ranking officials and special
food supplies for them.
   The city of Tianjin ordered its officials to stop buying or
building homes at government expense.
   Central China's Hubei province ordered a halt to special holiday
supplies of cigarettes and liquor for officials, and said
lunchrooms for officials should be converted to serve all their
staff.
   The local government pledges contained fascinating admissions of
privileges enjoyed by officials and not previously acknowledged.
   Southwest China's Sichuan province, for example, ordered its
officials to stop giving their children special work assignments,
help them to change jobs or travel abroad to study.
   The party has been preoccupied with tightening discipline since
it used troops to drive pro-democracy protesters out of central
Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   The popularity of the pro-democracy movement dramatized public
unhappiness with the party's leadership and wide dissatisfaction
within its own ranks.
   A People's Daily commentary on Sunday hinted that party members
can expect expulsion not only if they took part in the protests,
but for the lesser offenses of expressing support for them or
failing to criticize them.
   Party members, it said, are expected to ``unwaveringly carry out
the party line ... and make one's own words and deeds strictly
conform.''
   In recent years, many young Chinese have joined the party not
out of Communist fervor but as career moves.

<HEAD>USA Today Founder Blasted for Urging Return of `Sky Girls'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USA Today founder Al Neuharth says
airlines should make the skies friendlier by bringing back shapely,
young ``sky girls,'' but scores of the newspaper's staffers
dismissed his comments as ``bigoted and insulting.''
   Today's edition of USA Today carried a letter signed by more
than 175 of the newspaper's 426 newsroom employees, saying they
were ``offended, outraged and embarrassed'' by Neuharth's column.
   The newspaper also carried an interview with the head of the
Association of Flight Attendants, who said union members were
``stunned'' by the former Gannett Co. Inc. chairman's comments.
   ``My feeling was that Al Neuharth is either a Neanderthal or
some sort of court jester,'' said Susan Bianchi-Sand, 42, who added
that she had been a flight attendant for 20 years. ``I couldn't
figure out whether he just hasn't been in touch with reality or
he's just joking with us.''
   In a column last Friday, Neuharth said he began taking
commercial flights for the first time in 19 years after his recent
retirement, and didn't like what he found.
   ``Many of the young, attractive, enthusiastic female flight
attendants _ then called stewardesses _ have been replaced by aging
women who are tired of their jobs or by flighty young men who have
trouble balancing a cup of coffee or tea,'' he wrote.
   If he were running an airline, Neuharth said he would ``ease
today's cabin pressures'' for passengers by insisting on
old-fashioned vital statistics for ``sky girls'': unmarried female
nurses, under age 25, measuring 5-foot-4 or less and weighing under
115 pounds.
   ``We say this is bigoted and insulting _ not only to flight
attendants and nurses, but also to the women and men who work for
Gannett,'' the employee letter said.
   Bianchi-Sand said Neuharth's column trivialized the work of
flight attendants. USA Today noted that the column appeared on a
day in which attendants on United Airlines' Flight 232 described
their roles in the crash in Sioux City, Iowa, in which 185 of the
296 passengers survived.

<HEAD>Poles Make Panic Purchases; Kiszczak Picked as Premier Candidate</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Poles hoarding food, Kiszczak picked as
prime minister candidate; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panicky Poles stood in lines for hours
today to stock up on supplies of meat and sugar the day before the
government ends price controls and sends costs soaring.
   Also today, it was announced that Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak has been chosen the ruling Communist Party's candidate to
become prime minister and head the next government.
   Kiszczak, who represented the government in the April talks that
led to the reinstatement of Solidarity and a series of democratic
reforms, was picked by the Communist Party Central Committee on
Saturday, the state-run PAP news service said.
   Newly appointed party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski appeared
before Communist lawmakers today to urge Kiszczak's candidacy, PAP
said.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski was expected to formally nominate
Kiszczak, his confidant, to parliament later today, assuming the
candidacy did not meet opposition within the Communist coalition.
   If the coalition agrees on Kiszczak, his election would be
assured because it holds a 299-161 edge in the Sejm, parliament's
lower house.
   Meanwhile, consumers stood in line for hours to buy meat and
sugar before price controls and rationing are lifted Tuesday and
costs soar.
   The controversial food price move was endorsed by Rakowski, but
criticized by the Solidarity free trade union movement and some
Communist economists.
   A critic of the plan, Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka, said it
could raise food prices fourfold and turn the public against
reforms unless it is introduced more cautiously. Baka lost a policy
fight to delay the plan at the weekend Central Committee plenum.
   Long lines formed in front of grocery stores in the capital
today, with people reporting standing in line two hours to buy 2.2
pounds of sugar _ the maximum allowed. Lines for low-cost rationed
meat were even longer.
   The plan to eliminate meat rationing and price controls to
encourage farmers to produce more underlines the growing complexity
of Poland's political changes.
   Rakowski, a pragmatist who gathered support from party
conservatives to win election as party chief on Saturday, supports
the bold reform step and got the party to endorse it.
   Solidarity, the main opposition, backs the reform generally but
opposes it now because it feels the groundwork has not been laid.
It fears that when the already-high food prices rise they will fuel
unrest and could lead to strikes.
   Communist party spokesman Janusz Bisztyga, discussing the
election today, said Rakowski was picked to lead the party because
of his experience, international stature and ``He is a very good
fighter ... and wants to change the situation so that the party
will get up from its knees.''
   The opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza noted today that in the
Soviet Union ``110 morally and physically worn-out members of the
Central Committee'' recently were retired, while in Poland,
Kubasiewicz and Gorywoda were promoted.
   The newspaper also sharply criticized the food price plan,
calling on authorities and legislators to ``put everything in
order'' or things will ``blow up...''
   After his election Saturday, Rakowski told fellow Communists
that the party is not looking for a quarrel with the opposition,
``but we will fight back if provoked,'' according to a text made
public Sunday.
   PAP said that under the new food program, stores will be allowed
to buy meat directly from farmers starting for whatever price they
can negotiate, ending an administrative price system and a system
of official meat-buying points.
   Meat ration coupons, which have allowed each person to buy five
pounds of meat monthly from state-owned shops at controlled prices,
will be abolished. Consumers always could buy additional meat at
higher prices from private stores, but it was too expensive for
many people.
   Rakowski has said farmers are withholding meat and grain from
markets because the prices they get are insufficient.
   The only food prices that will still be controlled are bread,
low-fat milk, cottage cheese and milk formulas for infants.
   The program contains ``some money'' to compensate consumers for
the higher prices, but not enough to make up for the price
increases, PAP said. It said details would be published Tuesday.
   At the time of Rakowski's election, two regional party leaders
regarded as hard-liners were named to the Politburo, as was a
43-year-old party secretary known as a reformer. Four veteran
Politburo members resigned.
   It appeared that Rakowski was attempting to balance various
party factions within the Politburo.
   Bisztyga explained the naming of two politicians regarded as
hard-liners _ Warsaw party leader Janusz Kubasiewicz and Katowice
party chief Manfred Gorywoda _ to the party's ruling Politburo as
dictated by their political strength. Their organizations represent
a third of the Communists nationwide, he said.
   In Poland's freest elections in more than four decades last
month, the newly reinstated Solidarity movement won all but one of
the 261 parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest, prompting
the party to explore how it can start to rebuild public support.

   Vietnam today gave a U.S. military team
what may be the remains of 15 American soldiers killed in the
Vietnam War, an official Vietnamese radio broadcast said.
   A representative of Vietnam's Office For Seeking Missing
Personnel gave the remains to the team from the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, the Voice of Vietnam reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said it was the 25th
repatriation since March 1974, and 391 sets of remains have been
returned in all.
   In the past, remains have been returned in a U.S. military
ceremony at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport and then flown to an Army
laboratory in Hawaii for analysis.
   Vietnam returned what it believed to be the remains of 28
Americans on June 21. It has stepped up repatriations since an
August 1987 agreement in which the United States pledged to help
Vietnam seek humanitarian aid.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Jim Williams, said
U.S. experts were also to begin today their seventh joint search to
account for missing Americans. Their effort is to last 15 to 20
days.
   The experts are from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both based in Hawaii.
They are to search crash sites in the Vietnamese countryside and
interview villagers with the cooperation of the Vietnamese Office
for Seeking Missing Personnel. Remains have been recovered on
previous joint searches.
   About 2,350 Americans are listed as missing from the war that
pitted the South Vietnamese government and its U.S. ally against
communist forces from the north. The war ended in a communist
victory in April 1975.
   Vietnam also has stepped up cooperation on other humanitarian
issues as part of what U.S. analysts describe as efforts to improve
the climate for establishing diplomatic ties with the United States.
   On Sunday, the United States and Vietnam announced an agreement
for former political prisoners and their families to be resettled
in the United States, with the first group of 3,000 expected to
leave this year. The U.S. government had sought this program since
1982.
   After the communist victory, hundreds of thousands of people
were put into the camps for manual labor and political study
because of their ties with the old regime.

<TEXT>
   Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz
argued with God as a boy studying the Talmud in Brooklyn. Ever
since, he's made a career out of challenging the powers that be.
   Now, the defender of the civil rights of Soviet refuseniks and
U.S. Nazis has been vindicated in his clash with a federal judge
over a book about the Claus von Bulow case, in which he
successfully defended the socialite accused of trying to kill his
wife.
   U.S. District Judge Ronald Lagueux barred Dershowitz from his
courtroom because of the 1986 book, which castigated the Rhode
Island judicial system, but the outspoken attorney fought back _
and won.
   Rhode Island Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay said Sunday he would
not, at least for now, appoint a special prosecutor to investigate
Dershowitz, as Lagueux had requested.
   Dershowitz, who is campaigning to get Lagueux impeached, said
the judge's call for an investigation was retaliation for the
private censure Lagueux received last December after Dershowitz
filed disciplinary charges against him.
   ``I don't have much respect for authority. I fought with the
rabbis and with the teachers in college,'' Dershowitz, 50, said in
a recent interview.
   The tiff with Lagueux began with the publication of Dershowitz'
book ``Reversal of Fortune,'' about his part in the acquittal of
von Bulow.
   Mrs. von Bulow has been in a coma at Columbia Presbyterian
Hospital in New York for nine years. Von Bulow was convicted of
attempted murder in his first trial in 1982, but that conviction
was overturned and he was acquitted at retrial in 1985.
   Four days out of five Dershowitz teaches. On the fifth, he
practices law and generally makes a public fuss in defense of civil
liberties.
   ``I see this as part of my mission,'' he said. ``That's why I'm
willing to degrade myself and go on the Mort Downey show.''
   An untweedy 5-foot-9 in mustache, glasses and a willful head of
wiry red hair, Dershowitz has appeared on talk shows hosted by
Downey, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey, and on MacNeil-Lehrer, ``60
Minutes,'' and David Letterman. He writes a weekly column for 45
daily newspapers.
   His staunch, orthodox defense of civil liberties has led him to
take unpopular cases.
   Among his clients were a Jewish Defense League bombmaker who
killed a girl, U.S. Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and porn star Harry
Reems of ``Deep Throat'' fame. He helped defend CIA whistleblower
Frank Snepp, Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky, Patricia Hearst,
pro-PLO actress Vanessa Redgrave and spy Jonathan Pollard.
   ``I don't need the Bill of Rights. I'm a wealthy, educated,
powerful, tenured professor,'' Dershowitz said. ``I'm out there
protecting people who need the Bill of Rights.''
   A graduate of the Yale University Law School, Dershowitz joined
the Harvard faculty in 1965 at age 25 and was given a full
professorship at 28.
   The cachet of Yale and Harvard aside, he has a knack for
irritating some people, and his willingness to enter the public
forum leads to questions about his motives.
   Boston Magazine pounded Dershowitz last year in a biting profile
that put him on trial for being a publicity hound.
   ``The guy is so obsessed with being a celebrity figure, that
he'll do and say anything to get notoriety. To me that doesn't make
for a good person, and it doesn't make for a good lawyer,'' said
Vincent Morgera, a lawyer in Providence, R.I.
   Supporters of Dershowitz are just as passionate.
   ``In addition to having the mind of a steel trap, he has an
incredible legal imagination and can figure a way out of any legal
problem. He's one of the premier legal strategists in the United
States,'' said Harvey Silvergate, a criminal lawyer in Boston who
was a student of Dershowitz and later a colleague on the Harvard
faculty.
   Silvergate added: ``The only person I know who is able to
intimidate him is his mother.''

   Spirits were reported high among members
of a trans-Antarctica expedition after the six adventurers detoured
around the first gaping crevasse encountered on the trek.
   The expedition, led by Minnesotan Will Steger and Frenchman
Jean-Louis Etienne, made radio contact with their support crew at
an Antarctic research base and in Punta Arenas, Chile, on Sunday.
It was the second report since they began the 4,000-mile,
seven-month trip on skis and dog sleds last week.
   ``The dogs are very wild. They want to keep pulling to the South
Pole right now,'' said Steger, 44.
   The adventurers also talked to an ABC sports commentator for a
Sunday night special on the expedition.
   Steger reported that the St. Paul-based expedition would spend
several extra hours today photographing equipment supplied by
sponsors of the $11 million expedition.
   Steger hopes to draw worldwide attention to his exploits and
raise awareness of ecological threats to the frozen continent.
   On Saturday, the group came up to a ``very, very big crevasse,
longer than the dogs and sleds combined,'' radioed Etienne, a
French physician. He said the men backed away and went around it.
   The team had unobstructed travel Sunday, with a 25 mph crosswind
and daytime temperatures a mild 26 degrees. The surface of the
Larsen Ice Shelf, a plateau of permanent sea ice, is hard and
windblown, making travel fast.
   The expedition covered two miles after taking off Thursday, five
miles on Friday, 10 Saturday and 13 Sunday. The pace is expected to
quicken after a French film crew accompanying the explorers drops
off.
   The six-man team will have to cover 20 to 30 miles a day to
complete the crossing in seven months.

<TEXT>
   Zhou Yang, one of the Communist Party's leading
literary arbiters for nearly 60 years and, in his old age, a
champion of artistic freedom, died today. He was 81.
   Zhou had been hospitalized for six years, the official Xinhua
News Agency said without specifying his ailment or the cause of
death.
   It said top party officials, including Politburo Standing
Committee member Li Ruihuan, visited the hospital to offer
condolences to Zhou's family.
   From his youth as a leftist literary critic in wartime Shanghai,
through the Cultural Revolution and other political campaigns, Zhou
was a key player in the ideological battles that divided modern
Chinese artists, such as the purpose of art and whether it should
serve the party.
   In his youth, he came down on the side of strong party control,
but as chairman of the state-sponsored China Federation of Literary
and Art Circles from 1979 until this year, he advocated greater
artistic freedom.
   In 1983, he aroused controversy with an essay entitled
``Alienation,'' in which he said it was possible for people in a
socialist society to feel socially and politically alienated, and
that socialist leaders could become alienated from the people they
were to represent.
   He also sided with those who said literature should reflect the
ordinary lives and emotions of human beings, rather than simply
convey socialist lessons.
   He was harshly criticized when party conservatives launched a
campaign later that year against ``spiritual pollution,'' or
alleged bourgeois ideas. He was forced to write a public
self-criticism in which he said his essay could have led people to
lose confidence in the future of socialism.
   ``I have betrayed the party and the people's trust,'' he said.
   He was restored to favor in 1984 when the party newspaper, the
People's Daily, said that despite his mistakes, Zhou was ``an
outstanding Marxist theoretician.''
   Over his long career, Zhou also took part in attacks on other
intellectuals. He led a purge of the poet Hu Feng as an alleged
counterrevolutionary in 1955, and of the novelist Ding Ling as
``anti-party'' in 1957. In the 1930s, he fought bitterly with Lu
Xun, China's most famous modern writer, over Lu's opposition to a
party order that all writing take as its theme national defense
against the Japanese invasion.
   Zhou was born in 1907 in central China's Hunan province, under
the name Zhou Qiying. He attended university in Shanghai, then the
center of China's intellectual avante-garde, and later studied in
Japan. He joined the party in 1932.
   He held various influential posts in the cultural field during
the 1950s and early 1960s, including vice minister of culture. He
was purged in 1966 at the onset of the far-leftist Cultural
Revolution, as were most intellectuals. He was rehabilitated in
1977.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As one tropical depression gained strength and
speed on its march toward the Gulf Coast today, satellite images
showed another tropical depression taking shape over the
mid-Atlantic, forecasters said.
   People on the Gulf Coast west of the Florida Panhandle should
closely monitor the progress of first depression, advised Bob Case,
a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, a
suburb of Miami.
   At 6 a.m. EDT the storm system, the Atlantic hurricane season's
fourth tropical depression, had top sustained winds of 35 mph with
gusts to 45 mph. Its center was about 280 miles southeast of
Galveston, Texas.
   The system was moving north by northwest at about 12 mph and was
expected to grow stronger throughout today, the center said.
   Forecasters issued a tropical storm watch early today for the
Gulf Coast from Port O'Connor, Texas, to the mouth of the
Mississippi River. An Air Force reconnaissance plane was scheduled
to explore the depression later in the day.
   Meanwhile, in the middle of the Atlantic, satellite imagery
showed another tropical depression forming.
   By 8 a.m. EDT, the fifth tropical depression of the season had
top sustained winds of 35 mph and was centered 1,500 miles east of
the Lesser Antilles.
   It was moving west at about 18 mph and was expected to gain
strength and hold its course today, forecasters said.
   The next depression to reach top sustained speeds of 39 mph will
be named Tropical Storm Chantal, followed by Tropical Storm Dean.
Hurricanes have winds of 74 mph.
   Two depressions have formed into named storms since the 1989
Atlantic hurricane season began June 1.
   Tropical Storm Allison, the first, caused widespread flooding in
Texas and Louisiana in June. Storm Barry lived briefly in the open
Atlantic in mid-July before being downgraded to a tropical
depression and then dissipating.

<HEAD>Art Center Directors Decry Threatened Cutoff on Federal Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of two arts centers are protesting
the potential loss of $250,000 in annual federal grants if a
Senate-passed measure banning government aid for works judged
obscene becomes law.
   The Institute for Contemporary Art in Philadelphia said it could
lose about $175,000 for each of the next five years because it
organized a controversial exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe, who died
of AIDS earlier this year.
   Spokeswoman Nancy Burd said a $500,000 federal grant to aid in
the institute's move to a new building next year at the University
of Pennsylvania may also be threatened.
   Last week's Senate action also places in jeopardy a $75,000
annual National Endowment for the Arts grant that helps support an
artist fellowship program at the Southeastern Center for
Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The center was targeted by the measure's sponsor, Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., because it used federal funds to sponsor a photo
exhibition by Andres Serrano that included a picture of a crucifix
submerged in a container of the artist's urine.
   Both centers are seeking to muster support against the proposed
federal funding ban, which would last five years.
   ``Both these institutions are really being called for punishment
for doing our job, doing exactly what we're supposed to do,'' Ted
Potter, director of the North Carolina center, said in an interview.
   He described the centers' mandate as ``challenging people's way
of looking and seeing and thinking about critical issues of art,
culture and society.''
   The funding ban amendment was tacked on to a $171 million NEA
appropriation approved by the Senate on Wednesday. It would bar NEA
support for ``obscene and indecent materials, including but not
limited to depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts ....''
   It will be up to a House-Senate conference committee to
determine whether the amendment should remain in the final bill
passed by Congress.
   Helms said cutting off grants to the Pennsylvania and North
Carolina centers would ``certainly prevent them misusing federal
funds for the next five years.''
   But supporters of the Philadelphia institute argued that it had
followed NEA guidelines.
   ``In applying for NEA funding to support the Mapplethorpe show,
(the institute) provided the NEA with complete information on the
nature of the artist's work, including slides, and was granted
funding in accordance with established procedures,'' said Sheldon
Hackney, president of the University of Pennsylvania, which helps
support the center.

   A large IRA bomb loaded in a
laundry van exploded downtown in front of a heavily guarded court
building after hundreds of people were evacuated from the area,
police said.
   Three people were treated for shock after the blast outside the
Northern Ireland Court building, which caused widespread damage to
buildings in the area and wrecked 14 cars, police said.
   The bombers evaded tight security around the court to park a
laundry van in which they hid a bomb estimated to weigh 1,000
pounds, said a police spokesman.
   The spokesman, who refused to be named, said hundreds of office
workers and shoppers were evacuated from the area when a warning
call was received 35 minutes before the blast.
   Northern Ireland's law and order minister Peter Cope said the
courthouse will be closed for two days because of the
``considerable damage.''
   ``I am glad nobody was hurt or injured,'' he added.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army later claimed it planted the
bomb. The IRA is fighting to oust the British from the province and
unite it with the Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Senate Aims for Defense Bill Similar to Bush Plan</HEAD>

   The Senate is aiming for a defense bill that
closely resembles the blueprint sought by President Bush, unlike
the House version that rips apart the administration's strategic
weapons programs.
   In a rush to complete its work before the recess that begins
Friday, Congress tackles a full plate of appropriations bills this
week with the Senate trying to produce a defense package that
serves as a counterbalance to the House version.
   In final action late Thursday, the Democratic-controlled House
approved a $295 billion defense bill that severely curtails
production of the B-2 stealth bomber, slashes $1.8 billion from the
Star Wars budget and restores two planes _ the F-14D Tomcat jet
fighter and V-22 Osprey _ that Bush planned to kill.
   The last cut came as Alabama Republican William Dickinson joined
forces with Massachusetts liberal Democrat Barney Frank and
succeeded in eliminating all $100 million earmarked for the
Midgetman missile.
   ``Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment,'' Bush
told reporters Friday. ``But we're going to keep fighting on for
what we believe in.''
   The president said he is counting on the Senate to produce a
bill that keeps White House defense priorities in order. The
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat Sam Nunn
of Georgia, has given every indication he will do that.
   ``We are watching the strategic position of the administration
unwind step by step on the floor of the House,'' Nunn said Thursday
night as the House stripped all money for the Midgetman. ``It is
important that we not emasculate this program.''
   ``If the Senate does not come out with a reasonable budget on
all strategic programs, then we are going to be going to conference
in a hopeless situation,'' he added.
   To date, the Senate has followed the administration's line,
approving an amendment that largely endorses the B-2 bomber program
and makes a modest cut of $300 million from Bush's $4.7 billion B-2
request.
   On Thursday, the Senate narrowly turned aside an amendment to
freeze research and development of the Star Wars anti-missile
shield. Bush has requested $4.9 billion for the Star Wars program.
   Bush also expressed the administration's desire to work with the
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Democrat Les Aspin
of Wisconsin, who ``does not want to see the defense bill gutted,''
according to the president.
   Prior to committee action on the bill, Aspin urged his
Democratic and Republican colleagues to accept Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney's procurement budget without any add-ons.
   ``While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product
_ especially given the 39 days Dick Cheney had to put it
together,'' Aspin had told the procurement subcommittee, which
narrowly accepted the chairman's argument.
   But shortly after the House voted 261-162 to adopt the defense
bill, Aspin assessed the situation.
   ``We got a Michael Dukakis defense bill,'' the Wisconsin
Democrat told reporters, referring to the Massachusetts governor
who lost the 1988 presidential election to Bush.
   ``No Midgetman. No rail MX ... Big cuts in SDI, and slow up the
B-2 bomber,'' Aspin said in reference to Dukakis' campaign pledges.
   House and Senate conferees will meet after the August recess to
craft a final defense bill, which also includes $10 billion for the
Department of Energy for a $305 billion package.
   Another Armed Services panel member, Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,
said too much was being made of the House version which was merely
a ``position in the process.''
   The final defense bill will include some restrictions on the B-2
but not the version adopted by the House, plus ``a flattening out
of SDI money and resurrection of a small amount of funding for
Midgetman,'' Spratt said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said House-Senate conferees
``could alter on the margins the decisions made yesterday, but the
broad outline of these decisions will survive.''
   In other action this week:
   _The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Tuesday on
the nomination of William Lucas as the nation's chief civil rights
enforcer. Bush's choice for the post has come under attack from the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
other civil rights groups, who complain that Lucas lacks experience.
   _The Senate considers a compromise savings and loan bailout bill
that would balloon the federal budget deficit. A House-Senate
conference committee finished work last week on the plan that would
involve spending $166 billion, including interest, over the next 10
years _ the vast majority of it from taxpayers. The conference
committee rejected Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion in
rescue spending from the deficit, and senators warn that
Republicans could block the arrangement in the Senate.
   _The House and Senate consider bills expanding the government's
borrowing authority through Oct. 31 by $70 billion. The amount is a
temporary extension of the $2.8 trillion debt ceiling.

   The pro-Iranian group holding a U.S.
Marine colonel hostage said it planned to hang him today unless
Israel frees an influential Shiite Moslem cleric captured three
days ago. The deadline passed with no immediate word from the
captors.
   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel proposed
trading all his country's Shiite Moslem captives for all captured
Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by Shiite groups in
Lebanon. Rabin made the proposal in an announcement broadcast on
state-run Israel radio.
   Shiite groups in Lebanon are believed to hold three Israeli
soldiers and 17 foreigners, including nine Americans. Israeli
security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems from Lebanon are
held in Israeli prisons.
   The group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth said it would kill ``proven spy'' Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT), if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid were not freed.
   Government sources in Jerusalem have noted that Israel has
repeatedly stated that it would not bow to such threats.
   In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati condemned
both the death threat and the kidnapping of Obeid.
   ``We condemn the kidnapping of Sheik Obeid and we ask the
international community to put pressure on the Zionist regime to
release him,'' Velayati told foreign reporters at a news conference.
   ``The threat against Higgins has nothing to do with us. However,
we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat,'' he added.
   His comments came a day after another leading Iranian official
defended the threat against Higgins.
   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factions
believed to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine of them
Americans.
   Lebanese security sources and Israeli officials say Obeid played
a role in the kidnapping of Higgins last year, but Obeid denies it.
   In Sunday's statement, which was delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut, Higgins' captors said carrying out the death
sentence ``will be our first response to the stupid Israeli
aggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.
complicity in the crime.''
   Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal
militia called a general strike in Lebanon today to protest Obeid's
abduction.
   Businesses were closed throughout Moslem west Beirut and its
Shiite-populated southern slums, as well as the cities of Sidon,
Tyre, Nabatieh and Baalbek in south and east Lebanon.
   In Jerusalem earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Shimon
Peres defended Israel's decision to abduct Obeid, whom Israeli
officials have accused of instigating attacks on Israel. Peres said
Israeli officials hope he can be swapped for three Israeli soldiers
missing in Lebanon since 1986 and believed held by Hezbollah.
   ``I think that anything that prevents terror attacks against
Israel, the kidnapping of our soldiers, must be done within the
confines of law when there is a state of law,'' Peres said.
   ``Unfortunately in the case of Lebanon, it is a wild country and
Israel must defend itself,'' he added.
   Of the death threat, he said: ``This isn't the first time they
are threatening.''
   He would not say what Israel's response to the death threat
would be. ``I am not willing to relate either to details or to
threats,'' Peres said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today condemned the threat
to kill Higgins as ``outrageous, uncivilized, unconscionable
behavior.''
   ``There really can be no explanation for it and no excuse for
it,'' he told reporters in Paris as he headed into a second round
of meetings at an international conference on Cambodia.
   The group holding Higgins said in a Dec. 12 statement that it
had sentenced the Marine to death and said he ``made full
confessions about his espionage activities.''
   On Sunday, the group's statement said ``we shall carry out by
hanging the death sentence handed down against proven spy Higgins
at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid
and his two brethren have not been freed by then.''
   Israeli commandos stole into the southern Lebanese village of
Jibchit early Friday, kidnapped Obeid from his apartment and flew
him to Israel in a helicopter.
   His cousin, Ahmed Obeid, and a friend, Majid Fahs, also were
seized, Lebanese police said. A neighbor of Obeid's was shot to
death by troops when he opened his door during the kidnapping.
   Israel described Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs as ``assistants'' of
Obeid.
   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., was serving as head of an
observer group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988. His captors accused him
of spying for the CIA.
   Sunday's typewritten Arabic statement was not accompanied by a
picture of Higgins, the usual sign of authenticity. But it appeared
typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements.
   Israeli analysts today questioned whether Higgins was alive
before Obeid was captured.
   ``During the negotiations which are likely to open in the wake
of the kidnapping of Sheikh Obeid, Higgins' captors will have to
prove he is indeed alive,'' military analyst Zeev Schiff wrote in
the daily Haaretz.
   Obeid has denied involvement in Higgins' abduction or in
Hezbollah.
   But Israeli sources say Obeid was involved in the operation to
kidnap Higgins and held the Marine for a time in his home. One
source said Obeid was expected to provide information on Higgins.
   On Sunday, a leading Iranian official defended the threat
against Higgins.
   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militant
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests
of Israel and the United States,'' Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conference in Tehran. ``They will not
allow them to live comfortably.''
   He named pro-Iranian Hezbollah as one of the Moslem groups that
should retaliate.
   Asked about the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Mohtashemi said:
``The issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us.''
   An Iranian newspaper said Obeid's abduction jeopardized moves to
free the hostages. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   ``The Zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian
efforts to release hostages in Lebanon,'' the Tehran Times said in
an editorial Sunday.

   Three reputed Mafia figures who escaped
conviction on state charges of murdering a New York City detective
have been found guilty in federal court of racketeering in the 1986
slaying.
   Frederico ``Fritzy'' Giovanelli, 56; Steven Maltese, 57, and
Carmine ``Buddy'' Gualtiere, 55, of New York City, were convicted
Sunday of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   Detective Anthony J. Venditti, 34, was shot to death and his
partner, Detective Kathleen Burke, was injured in 1986 outside a
diner during mob surveillance.
   ``Tony Venditti can finally rest in peace,'' Burke said after
the 11-week trial.
   The defendants were charged with murder, but the first trial in
1987 ended in a hung jury and the second in 1988 resulted in
Gualtiere's acquittal and a deadlock over charges against
Giovanelli and Maltese.
   Prosecutors then turned to federal court, charging the men under
the RICO Act.
   ``It demonstrates our resolve to use every legal means available
to us to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of a
police officer,'' said U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.
   ``It also demonstrates the extraordinary value of the RICO
statutes to allow us, in this case, to place in context the murder
of Police Officer Venditti as part of a pattern of crime engaged in
to protect a large-scale gambling operation.''
   The jury found the three guilty of racketeering, loansharking,
interstate travel in aid of the racketeering enterprise and tax
charges. Under the racketeering charges, the three also were
convicted of murder and attempted murder.
   The three reputed associates of the Genovese crime family did
not know Venditti was a police officer and were afraid they were
going to be ``ripped off,'' Romano said.
   The verdict came on the fifth day of deliberations.
   Giovanelli faces 70 years in prison, Maltese 75 years and
Gualtiere 50. Each could be fined more than $1 million. Sentencing
was set for Oct. 18.

   Top officials in the Department of Housing and
Urban Development should have to keep a log of every visitor and
telephone call as a means of discouraging influence-peddling that
pervaded the agency, a former senator proposed today.
   ``Some will say that requiring such reports as a matter of law
is too burdensome, is an interference with privacy or is
micromanaging,'' former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., told a House
panel. ``Keep in mind these are public officials. They are on the
public payroll. They are dealing with hundreds of millions of
dollars of the public's money.''
   Proxmire, who was chairman of a Senate subcommittee with
responsibility for overseeing the department, acknowledged today he
was ``chagrined that I had no idea what was going on at HUD'' until
congressional hearings began in recent months.
   Witnesses before the House Government Operations subcommittee on
housing and employment have said that HUD contracts worth millions
of dollars were awarded on the basis of political influence and
that some programs were monitored so poorly that people just
pocketed government money with no one to stop them.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who took office this year with a pledge
to clean up the department, has estimated that the corruption has
cost the government $2 billion.
   Many of the deals now under investigation involved former HUD
officials or well-connected Republicans who used their influence at
the top levels of the agency to gain approval for projects in which
they had some financial interest.
   Proxmire said his proposal, requiring reports on such meetings
be given to Congress and the news media, would force HUD officials
to make an immediate public accounting of their actions in the
future.
   ``I'm not asking that these conferences be made public or that
congressional staffers or the press sit in when the department
secretary or other decisionmakers meet to discuss how, where and
how much of the public money to spend,'' Proxmire said.
   ``I am asking that the secretary and others automatically notify
the responsible people in Congress and interested media people
within 24 hours of the time of any discussion or written
correspondence relating to spending the public money.''
   The subcommittee later today was to hear from Maurice Barksdale,
a former HUD assistant secretary, and John Knapp, former general
counsel to the department. Knapp also testified before the panel on
May 25.

   The third tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season developed in the Gulf of Mexico today bearing 50 mph winds,
prompting hurricane warnings along the Texas and Louisiana coast.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Tropical Storm Chantal was centered about 260
miles southeast of Galveston, Texas, moving northwest near 8 mph,
and was expected to move ashore Tuesday with high tides and heavy
rain, forecasters said.
   The storm was expected to build into a hurricane tonight or
Tuesday, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center
in suburban Coral Gables. Hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph.
   Hurricane warnings were posted from Freeport, Texas, to Morgan
City, La. Tropical storm warnings were went up from Port O'Connor,
Texas, to Freeport and from Morgan City to Mobile, Ala.
   Tides of 5 to 7 feet above normal were expected over the
hurricane warning area and up to 7 to 10 feet above normal near and
to the right of where the center hits land. Small craft were
advised to remain in port.
   Chantal formed from the fourth tropical depression of the
Atlantic season.
   As Chantal gained strength, satellite images showed another
tropical depression taking shape in the mid-Atlantic. By 9 a.m.
EDT, it had top sustained winds of 35 mph and was centered 1,500
miles east of the Lesser Antilles.
   That depression was moving west at about 18 mph and was expected
to gain strength and hold its course today.
   If its winds hit a sustained speed of 39 mph, it will be named
Tropical Storm Dean.
   Two depressions have formed into named storms since the 1989
Atlantic hurricane season began June 1.
   Tropical Storm Allison, the first, caused widespread flooding in
Texas and Louisiana in June. Storm Barry lived briefly in the open
Atlantic in mid-July before dissipating.

   Frances Woodworth Wright, a Harvard
University astronomer who taught celestial navigation to Navy
officers, died of cancer Sunday at age 92.
   During more than half a century of research and teaching,
Wright's studies ranged from investigating specks of cosmic dust
called spherules to calculating the brightness of galaxies and
developing efforts to observe comets and meteors.
   Her special interest was celestial navigation, the guiding of
ships by the stars. Among her students were Army engineers and Navy
officers enrolled in special courses during World War II. She also
taught Harvard undergraduates and weekend sailors and wrote three
books on sailing by the stars.
   Wright taught astronomy and mathematics at Elmira College in New
York before going to Harvard in 1928 to serve as an assistant to a
succession of prominent astronomers, including Cecilia
Payne-Gaposchkin, Harlow Shapley and Fred Whipple.
   She earned a doctorate in astronomy from Radcliffe College in
1958.

   Frederic Ernest Morrison, who was already an
acting veteran when he joined the original ``Little Rascals''
comedy team nearly 70 years ago, died of cancer last week at age 76.
   Known as ``Sunshine Sammy,'' Morrison appeared regularly on
stage and in films during the '20s, '30s and '40s before leaving
show business to become quality control inspector in the aerospace
industry.
   Rediscovered by ``Little Rascals'' fans nearly 30 years later,
he went on to make guest appearances in the 1970s on such TV shows
as ``The Jeffersons'' and ``Good Times.''
   Morrison broke into acting at age 3 in a series of Baby Marie
Osbourne films. ``The Sunshine Sammy Series,'' which followed,
lasted only one episode, but Hal Roach saw him in it and cast him
as a Little Rascal in 1922.
   Morrison, the oldest of the group, appeared in 28 episodes
before leaving two years later to do vaudeville in New York City.
He returned to Hollywood in the 1940s, appearing regularly in
``Dead End Kids'' and ``East Side Kids'' movies.
   Morrison was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in
1987.

   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage
1{ years ago in Lebanon by Shiite Moslems who now claim to have
executed him, headed a 75-member force of U.N. peacekeepers in
Lebanon.
   After he was kidnapped, his uncle said Higgins had fulfilled his
goal of making his family proud.
   ``He loves his country,'' said Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, Ky.
``He is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will
under the circumstances. ... I don't think they could bring enough
pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way.''
Eagle died four months ago.
   The Shiite Moslems holding Higgins had said Sunday they would
hang him unless Israel released a Shiite Moslem clergyman kidnapped
Friday by Israeli commandos. Today, the group claimed it had
carried out the execution to retaliate for the Israeli kidnapping
of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Earlier today, however, Israeli analysts questioned whether
Higgins was alive before Obeid was captured.
   ``During the negotiations which are likely to open in the wake
of the kidnapping of Sheikh Obeid, Higgins' captors will have to
prove he is indeed alive,'' military analyst Zeev Schiff wrote in
the daily Haaretz.
   When he was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, Higgins, 44, headed the
observer group assigned to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon. He was returning from talks with a moderate Shiite Moslem
militia leader that reportedly touched on foreign hostages.
   In December, Higgins' kidnappers said they had sentenced him to
death as a spy for Israel. Their statement at that time did not
give an execution date for Higgins, a one-time aide to former U.S.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Higgins, born in Danville, Ky., grew up in southern Jefferson
County, Ky.
   By the time he left for college, he was well on the way to
fulfilling the ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook: ``For
my family to always be proud of me.''
   He won appointment to West Point, but he chose instead to study
at Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship.
   He was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated in
1967 with a business degree, and he later earned master's degrees
from Pepperdine University and Auburn University in Alabama.
   Higgins served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972 and later was a rifle
company commander in Okinawa, Japan, an instructor at the staff
non-commissioned officers academy at Quantico, Va., and a rifle
company commander at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   Higgins served in various staff positions at Marine Corps
headquarters in Washington and at the Pentagon. He graduated from
the National War College in 1985.
   He and his first wife, Bonita Spalding of Louisville, Ky., had a
daughter, Christine Lynn. She is 17.
   His second wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, works at the
Pentagon.

   Here is the text of Pesident Bush's reaction to
reports that Shiite Moslem terrorists hanged Marine L. Col. William
Higgins in Lebanon today. Bush was speaking to the National
Governors Association.
   ``I want to comment on a very disturbing report that we've just
heard. There are unconfirmed reports that Colonel Higgins has
indeed been executed.
   ``I had planned to go on out to Nevada for another appearance
today and then to go to Oklahoma tonight. But this matter is of
such concern to me and to all of you and to the American people
that I think it's appropriate that I go back to Washington.
   ``Whether the report is true or not, I know I speak for all here
when I try to express to the American people the sense of outrage
that we all feel about this kind of brutality, this uncalled-for
terrorism.
   ``This was a young American colonel serving in an international
force, and it is incumbent on all of us to try to rectify this
situation if at all possible.
   ``I have no more to share with you on this. We have not been
able to confirm this horrible report. But I will go back to
Washington and convene our top national security people and first
establish to the best of our ability if the report is true, and
then figure out what might conceivably be done.
   ``So I'm sorry to bring to this meeting a message of that
nature, the bad news, but I felt you would want to know about it.''

<HEAD>Overall Use of Illicit Drugs Drops but Number of Heavy Cocaine Users
Jumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 9th pvs, The survey, to add comment on
reliability of survey, more detail.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overall use of illicit drugs dropped
sigificantly in the United States since 1985, but the number of
heavy cocaine users jumped, according to a government survey
released today.
   The 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found a
decrease of 37 percent from a 1985 survey in the number of people
who said they had used illicit drugs within a month of being
surveyed.
   However, the survey found a 33 percent increase in the number of
people using cocaine once a week or more, and a 19 percent increase
in the number of people using the drug daily or almost daily.
   ``Mindful of the destructive power of drugs and those who peddle
them, this survey should not be viewed as a declaration of success,
but as a rallying point for sustained and invigorated demand and
supply reduction initiatives,'' said Louis Sullivan, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``While we celebrate our impressive gains, let us resolve to
reinforce and build on them,'' he said.
   ``Most use of most drugs by most Americans _ overall drug use _
is off sharply. But cocaine addiction has dramatically
intensified,'' said William J. Bennett, director of federal drug
control policy.
   ``We are not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot. The
reductions in American drug use are not the whole story, as anyone
who watches television, reads a newspaper, or lives in a city, can
see for himself. Drug crime is up, drug trafficking is up, drug
deaths are up, drug emergencies in our hospitals are up _ all since
1985. And much of this can be explained in one word: crack,''
Bennett said.
   The survey covers the population age 12 and older living in
households in the 48 contiguous states. The results are based on
personal interviews and written questions answered by 8,814 people.
The survey does not include homeless people, people living in
military installations, dormitories and institutions such as
hospitals and prisons.
   The survey, conducted last fall, is the ninth in a series that
began in 1971. It is sponsored by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, an HHS agency.
   Sullivan said that despite assurances of confidentiality for
those in the survey, there is ``some likely underreporting.'' But,
he said, the numbers are reliable in showing trends in drug use.
``I wouldn't bet the rent on the absolute numbers but I would on
the trends,'' he said.
   Sullivan credited national media campaigns and school and
community-based drug-abuse prevention programs for the decline in
casual drug use. If that decline can be sustained, he said, it ``in
time will also influence the number of addicts.''
   ``These figures show that we can have an effect and it shows
that what we're doing is working and that is cause for
encouragement as well as redoubling and rededication of efforts and
resources,'' he said.
   Bennett and Sullivan said more resources are needed to treat
drug addiction.
   According to the survey, the number of people who used
marijuana, cocaine or any other illicit drug within the month
previous to being surveyed dropped from 23 million in 1985 to 14.5
million in 1988.
   Those who used an illicit drug within the previous year fell
from 37 million to 28 million _ a decline of almost 25 percent.
   Sullivan said some of the cocaine statistics were encouraging:
The number of people who reported using the drug within the
previous month dropped by 50 percent, from 5.8 million in 1985 to
2.9 million last year, and the number who had used the drug in the
previous year fell 33 percent from 12 million to 8 million.
   But the survey indicated the number of people who used cocaine
once a week or more grew from 647,000 in 1985 to 862,000 last year.
The number of daily or almost-daily users rose from 246,000 in 1985
to 292,000 last year.

   President Bush, in a speech overshadowed by
reports of the execution of an American hostage in Lebanon, today
summoned state governors to a September summit to search for ways
to improve the nation's educational performance.
   Bush tendered the invitation to the Sept. 27-28 meeting in a
speech at the National Governors' Association summer meeting here,
then cut short a planned two-day speechmaking trip to return to
Washington to check on the execution reports and ``figure out what
might conceivably be done'' in response.
   The president spoke soon after Shiite Moslem captors of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins claimed they had hanged the officer, who
was assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, in
retaliation for Israel's kidnapping last week of a Moslem cleric
and two aides from south Lebanon.
   From Chicago, Bush's originally had planned to fly to Las Vegas,
Nev., to speak before the Disabled American Veterans and to
Oklahoma City, where he was to address a convention of the
Fraternal Order of Police on Tuesday.
   Instead, the president headed back to the capital after
delivering his speech to the governors and taking questions from
them.
   In his remarks, Bush predicted that the education summit will be
``an historic meeting,'' only the third time in history a president
has convened a gathering of the governors.
   The Education Department has already been providing pilot funds
for school districts trying school reforms embraced by the
governors' association.
   In his speech, Bush did not offer any new financial aid to
education, saying only that ``federal dollars should be targeted to
those most in need.'' He reiterated support of ``choice for
parents'' in where they want to send their children to school.
   The president also enlisted the governors' help in combating
other social problems, from crime to drug abuse to welfare
dependency, that he portrayed as undermining America's progress.
   He said he shares with the chief executives of the 50 states
``common challenges and responsibilities.''
   ``To cure our nation of illiteracy, drug abuse and crime, we
must act in tandem, president with governor and governor with
mayor, up and down the line,'' he said. ``In short we must find our
collective will as a nation.''
   ``Today we do not meet in a spirit of immediate crisis. The
nation is sound,'' Bush continued. ``But the decline of our
educational system, the threat of crime and drugs, the economic
dependency of so many _ these problems threaten to endanger the
very leadership position of America in the next century.''
   ``... A nation in which a half of our youth is ignorant of
geography, in which drugs are rampant, in which a substantial
proportion of the population knows little hope _ such a nation will
not long remain competitive,'' he said.
   ``Improving our schools, driving out drugs and bringing hope and
opportunity to those who need it most _ these are issues of our
national well-being, even our national security,'' he said.
   Bush promised during last year's campaign to convene an
education summit, and discussed it with the governors' executive
committee at the White House in May.
   Only twice before have the nation's governors met en masse with
the president on an issue of vital national importance, Bush said.
The first was a conference on conservation called by Theodore
Roosevelt and the second a meeting convened by Franklin D.
Roosevelt on how to ``stem the financial crisis of the Great
Depression,'' Bush said.
   ``Together we can find ways to strengthen our schools, to
enlarge opportunities and to improve our nation's educational
performance,'' he said.
   Bush announced that he has instructed his Domestic Policy
Council to give the governors flexibility in the rules now being
drafted to carry out welfare reforms enacted last year.
   The importance of education to the economy was underscored
Sunday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told the
governors, ``The major capital of the next century is going to be
minds that produce ideas.''
   ``More and higher quality education must be presumed to be
crucial in America's competition with our industrial partners for
economic world leadership,'' Greenspan said.
   Congress has been slow to act on Bush's proposed $1.2 billion
anti-crime package. Bush wants to build more prisons and beef up
the ranks of federal prosecutors and agents.
   The administration's drug policy director, William J. Bennett,
is still formulating a new national strategy to combat drug abuse.
By law, the administration has until early September to produce
that battle plan.

   President Bush and a few friends ate
Mexican cuisine at a suburban restaurant, with the president
sampling the house specialty, fajitas.
   Bush, accompanied by Secretary of Comnmerce Robert Mosbacher and
former aide Craig Fuller and his wife, Karen, dined at the Rio
Grande Cafe on Sunday night.
   Barbara Bush was at Kennebunkport, Maine, at their oceanfront
home. The commerce secretary also came without his wife, Georgette.
   Bush skipped another event originally planned for the evening,
the finals of the Sovran Tennis Classic at an outdoor Washington
arena. It rained intermittently during the afternoon and evening.
   Bush, clad in a sports shirt and yellow blazer, ignored
questions from reporters as he left the restaurant.

   Followers of Santeria went to federal court today
to challenge a ban on animal sacrifice, arguing the practice is
integral to their Afro-Cuban religion.
   Jorge Duarte, a lawyer for the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,
said the Hialeah city ordinance violates followers' freedom of
religion.
   But an attorney for the city countered that the ordinance is a
permissible effort to regulate the killing of animals and disposal
of their bodies.
   ``There is a legal governmental need for prevention of cruelty
to animals and prevention of disease,'' said Richard Garrett.
``Animals are being left throughout the city.''
   He also told U.S. District Judge Eugene P. Spellman that the
sight of smeared blood causes children ``to be more violent.''
   As many as 25,000 people in South Florida are followers of
Santeria, whose rites include the killing of chickens, birds and
goats as offerings to the gods.
   Three city ordinances passed in 1987 ban the ritual sacrifice or
slaughter of any living creature. Violations carry a fine of $500
or 60 days in jail.
   Duarte, who is being assisted by the American Civil Liberties
Union, compared Santeria rites with Jewish dietary laws that are
protected under federal and state law.

   When Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was abducted in February 1988,
the U.S. Marine was on duty for the United Nations in a land so
dangerous for Americans that the State Department had declared it
off-limits.
   Higgins, 44, commanded an international group monitoring
cease-fire violations on the Lebanon-Israel border. He was
kidnapped while returning from talks with a moderate Shiite Moslem
militia leader, who said their conversation touched on the subject
of foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   A statement from the kidnappers issued Dec. 12, 1988, said they
had sentenced Higgins to death as a spy for Israel.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' said the statement signed by a group calling itself
the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth. It did not set a date
for killing him.
   On Monday, his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said they had
hanged the American in retaliation for Israel's abduction of Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric in south Lebanon.
   They released a videotape in which a man said to be Higgins
dangled from a gallows, his hands and feet bound with rope. There
was no way to verify whether the victim was Higgins or when the
hanging had occurred.
   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press the United Nations
had received unconfirmed reports Higgins was killed after the USS
Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf on July
3, 1988.
   On Monday, Israeli analysts questioned whether Higgins was alive
before Obeid was captured Friday.
   Higgins, born Jan. 15, 1945, in Danville, Ky., had been an aide
to Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of defense in the Reagan
administration. When he was abducted Feb. 17, 1987, he led a
75-member observer group assigned to the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon.
   In January 1987, the State Department declared Lebanon
off-limits to U.S. citizens, except for the families of kidnap
victims, journalists and others with special permission.
   The Pentagon has said American officers chosen for duty with the
United Nations are under U.N. command and the Pentagon has no
control over where they serve.
   Higgins was kidnapped while returning from a meeting in Tyre
with Abdel Majid Saleh, a political leader in the area of the
moderate Shiite militia Amal, Saleh told reporters. He said the
topics of discussion included efforts to free foreign hostages.
   U.N. officials said Higgins was driving a marked U.N. station
wagon, following a similar vehicle carrying two other members of
the observer force. The first car lost sight of Higgins around a
bend, returned to look for him and found his vehicle abandoned.
   Security sources in Tyre said two gunmen in a brown Volvo passed
Higgins' station wagon, blocked the road, forced him into their car
and drove north toward Tyre.
   They said the abduction occurred between Ras el-Ein and Deir
Qanoun, villages controlled by Amal, and that members of the
militia helped with the search search for Higgins.
   Reporters in Tyre said at the time the influence of the
fundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, had been
growing in the villages. Hezbollah, allied with Iran, is believed
to be the umbrella group for radical factions holding most foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   Higgins' uncle, Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, Ky., said of his
nephew soon after the kidnapping: ``He loves his country. `He is
capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the
circumstances. ... I don't think they could bring enough pressure
or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way.''
   Higgins grew up in Jefferson County, Ky., and won appointment to
West Point, but chose instead to attend Miami University in Oxford,
Ohio, on a Navy ROTC scholarship.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant when he graduated in
1967 with a business degree, and later earned master's degrees in
human resources management at Pepperdine University and political
science at Auburn University.
   Higgins served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972. He later was a rifle
company commander in Okinawa, Japan, an instructor at the academy
for non-commissioned officers at Quantico, Va., and a rifle company
commander at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   In 1980, he graduated from the Air Force Command and Staff
College at Maxwell Air Force Base. Higgins served in various staff
positions at Marine Corps headquarters in Washington and at the
Pentagon, and graduated from the National War College in 1985.
   He and his first wife, the former Bonita Spalding of Louisville,
had a daughter, Christine Lynn. His second wife, Marine Maj. Robin
Higgins, works at the Pentagon.
   Both parents have died _ his mother, Mary Ethel Higgins, in
1979, and his father, William F. Higgins, soon after the abduction.

   An estimated 8,000 grocery clerks and meat
cutters agreed to end an 81-day strike that forced Puget Sound
supermarkets to cut back their hours.
   Members of the Food and Commercial Workers union voted Sunday
night to accept a three-year contract that provides raises and
continues Sunday premium pay, which employers had sought to cut,
said union spokeswoman Sandi Hubler.
   Grocers also withdrew a proposal for drug testing, she said.
   The workers, who walked out May 11, were expected to begin
returning today.
   The agreement with Allied Employers Inc., the industry group
that conducted negotiations, ends a strike at Safeway, Albertson's,
Food Giant, Fred Meyer, Mega Foods and other chains in King, Pierce
and Snohomish counties.
   Markets had hired workers to replace the strikers, but many
stores were forced to cut back their hours.
   The contract is expected to set a pattern for agreements
covering about 25,000 workers at virtually all markets in the Puget
Sound area.
   Four union locals that revealed vote counts reported lopsided
voting in favor of the pact. At the big Seattle Local 1105, the
vote was 1,605 to 235.
   Employees must report their availability within 24 hours,
enabling employers to recall workers as needed, said Don King,
executive director of the management group.
   The agreement gives raises to workers in all classifications,
said Jay Murphy, a union business agent. Pay for top-scale clerks
will rise to $11.45 an hour from $11.15, he said. Top-scale meat
cutters make slightly more.

   Israeli officials said today they received no
immediate confirmation of a claim from a Moslem Shiite group that
it executed a U.S. Marine hostage to retaliate for the Israeli
abduction of a Moslem cleric.
   They also reiterated their offer made earlier today to trade all
Israel's Shiite Moslem captives for all captured Israeli soldiers
and foreign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon.
   A pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said it
executed Lt. Col. William R. Higgins today after a deadline passed
for their demand that the abducted cleric be released.
   Higgins was head of an unarmed U.N. observer group in Lebanon
when he was abducted in February 1988 in south Lebanon.
   ``At this point, we have no confirmation that, indeed, Colonel
Higgins was murdered,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``We have to be very cautious with a possible reaction because
you remember a year ago the same organization said that they
executed Col. Higgins after the accidental shooting-down of an
Iranian airplane by the U.S. Navy.
   ``So we will have to look for further evidence to confirm where
such an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   Sources in Lebanon have said the United Nations received
unconfirmed reports earlier this year that Higgins was killed after
an Iranian airliner was shot down by a U.S. warship on July 3, 1988.
   Spokesmen for Israel's defense and foreign ministries refused to
comment immediately on the report of Higgins' death.
   In making the Israeli offer today, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said, ``Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeli
and other hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon. Israel is
offering to trade prisoners, detainees and hostages.''
   His statement to reporters in Tel Aviv, read from a prepared
text, was also broadcast on state-run Israel radio. Pazner later
said the offer was made on behalf of the government.
   ``According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners and
foreign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swapped
for all the Shiite prisoners kept by Israel, including Sheik Abdel
Karim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others,'' Rabin said.
   He said such an exchange would be conducted through the
International Red Cross.
   Pazner said the offer stands despite the claim that Higgins had
been executed.
   Obeid is an influential Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by
Israeli commandos Friday in south Lebanon, and Kasfi is another
Lebanese Shiite seized by Israeli forces in Lebanon last December.
   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factions
believed to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine are
American.
   Security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems from Lebanon
are held in Israeli prisons.
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, which helps
patrol Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, holds
about 300 Shiites in a prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. It was not
immediately clear if this group would be part of the deal.
   Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres had said earlier today that
Israeli officials hoped Obeid could be swapped for three Israeli
soldiers missing in Lebanon since 1986 and believed held by
Hezbollah.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab
took the occasion of the Custom Service's 200th anniversary today
to announce his resignation and take some parting shots at those in
government he considers not as committed as he to the war on drugs.
   ``When we exposed the tin-horned dictator (Manuel) Noriega (of
Panama) as a drug king, the mildest phrase some used on us was
`out-of-control,''' von Raab told Customs officials gathered near
the Washington Monument.
   ``They attacked us, not him, but now they agree,'' said von
Raab, who was denied reappointment to the post he has held for
eight years and has been harshly critical of government colleagues
in recent interviews.
   ``When DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) agent Kiki Camarena
was murdered in Mexico, we showed this country's outrage by
cracking down hard on the border. Mexico's Foreign Minister
Sepulveda attacked us; some in our own government actually joined
him,'' von Raab said.
   ``If we dared to speak out, it was because those in our own
government were too scared to speak up.''
   Von Raab, who said his resignation was effective at midnight
tonight, was praised at the 200th anniversary celebration by
lawmakers on opposite sides of the political spectrum for his
outspokenness on the drug war and the infighting between government
agencies.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called von Raab ``a man of courage,
integrity and forthrightness,'' while Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
said von Raab ``leaves a tradition and a standard for the rest of
us to follow.''
   The Customs Service included in its press package for the
anniversary celebration a copy of von Raab's letter of resignation,
sent today to President Bush, in which he blasted a failure of the
federal government to work together in the drug war.
   While praising William J. Bennett, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, as a ``courageous man,'' von Raab
said he was ``deeply concerned by what I have witnessed within the
bureaucracy over the past months.
   ``The political jockeying, backstabbing and malaise that has
crept into the current effort have frustrated me, and are
threatening the antidrug efforts and successes of the past years,''
von Raab said in the letter.
   He also took a sharp hit at the Treasury Department, which
oversees the Customs Service, saying that many Treasury officials
``have shown at best a distinct lack of interest in the drug
efforts of the Customs Service, and at worst, an outright demotion
of Customs in relation to other Treasury priorities.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who spoke last at the
ceremony, did not mention von Raab's imminent departure, focusing
instead on the hard work by Customs employees, cooperation among
Cabinet members in the antidrug effort and saying that the drug war
``is a war we are going to win.''
   At the close of the ceremony, von Raab shook hands with many of
the officials gathered on stage, but not with Brady.
   At a post-ceremony news conference, von Raab called Brady ``an
honorable man'' but said, ``I'm quitting, obviously, because I'm
not getting along with Secretary Brady.''
   Von Raab said he couldn't understand why Brady did not mention
him in his remarks and that he had toned down his own comments at
the request of the Treasury Department.
   He said he had heard rumors he would be fired, possibly in
response to similar blasts he has made at his department and others
in media interviews in previous weeks.
   Asked later whether it wasn't disingenuous of him to claim he
couldn't understand Brady's lack of warmth toward him in light of
his statements, von Raab simply shrugged, smiled and walked away.

<HEAD>Dock Strike Fizzles As Workers Return to Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-week-old national dock workers' strike fizzled
Monday as more workers returned to their jobs after employers
threatened to fire those who stayed away.
   In Bristol, however, 480 dock workers voted to continue to stay
out over government plans to abolish guaranteed lifelong employment.
   Port employers said the returns meant that 3,668, or 57 percent,
of those affected by the job guarantee program were working and
2,741 remained on strike. Forty of the 60 ports affected by the
strike were operating normally, they said.
   ``Clearly more than 50 percent of dockers are back at work. They
have voted with their feet and I hope the Transport and General
Workers' Union will heed their wishes and call off this strike,''
said Nick Finney, director of the National Association of Port
Employers.
   But opposition Labor Party lawmaker Michael Meacher said Sunday:
``The reason is not lack of support for the cause, but the
intimidation and blackmail involved in threats of sackings.''
   The swing away from the strike came after union leaders voted
Friday to intensify the dispute and try to get more workers to
rejoin the strike.
   About 750 workers at the key ports of Southampton and Hull
defied their national leaders to return to the waterfronts Monday.
   Associated British Ports, one of Britain's biggest dock owners,
had threatened to fire Southampton, Hull and Fleetwood workers if
they stayed away Monday.
   The union leadership was due to meet Tuesday to discuss tactics.

<TEXT>
   A woman says her two turkeys need not worry
about winding up on a Thanksgiving platter this year, because the
big birds earn their living guarding chickens.
   Lacy Robinson said her two turkey gobblers are the match of any
watch dogs as they keep a close eye on 4,500 egg-layers.
   ``They make a ruckus when anyone comes around, and when they
find a snake, they keep on gobblin' 'til someone comes to see
what's happening,'' she said recently.
   Mrs. Robinson says the two birds already are survivors. They
were among 10 her husband bought three years ago.
   ``People kept wanting them, so I'd say, `Catch what you want,
down to two _ I want them for my Thanksgiving and Christmas
dinners.''
   ``Well, I got so busy that there just weren't enough hours in
the day _ what with stripping cotton, feeding cows and chickens _
that I just bought turkeys (to cook). The same thing happened the
next two years, so I guess they're safe now.''

   Soviet and Swiss authorities have agreed to
establish a joint-venture management school and research center in
Kiev, it was announced Monday.
   The school, to begin operation in October, will provide
management courses, research and consulting services to Soviet
firms and educational institutions, according to the private,
Geneva-based International Management Institute.
   It is the Soviet Union's first management school set up as an
international joint venture, the institute said. It said the
agreement, between the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the
institute, was signed in early July in Kiev.
   The planned curriculum includes a one-year master's degree in
business administration for managers with at least three years'
experience, as well as courses for senior managers.
   The school will have the right to set up branches in the Soviet
Union, and its staff of teachers and researchers will be
international, IMI said.

   Relatives of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins reacted with shock,
anger and disbelief today after pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems
announced the Marine had been hanged.
   In Lancaster, Ky., where Higgins spent summers as a youth, his
aunt, Leona Huffman, said she saw TV reports of the purported
killing, but after 1{ years of uncertainty about her nephew's fate,
she remained skeptical.
   ``I'm just not going to believe anything until I hear direct,''
said Mrs. Huffman, sister of Higgins' late mother, Ethel.
   Higgins, who was born in Danville, Ky., and grew up near
Louisville, was serving as head of an observer group attached to
the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was seized in
February 1988. His captors accused him of spying for the CIA.
   Pro-Iranian Moslems today said he was executed in retaliation
for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric.
   Mrs. Huffman blamed the kidnappers for the death in February of
her brother, a retired judge.
   ``Unless you would go through something like this, you'd have no
idea what this has been to us,'' she said. ``My brother that
worshipped this child _ I think what killed him ... was grief.''
   Higgins' sister Mary Fisher said the State Department had called
her in the Louisville, Ky., suburb of Okolona. ``I will not reveal
what they said,'' said Ms. Fischer said.``Right now, I'm in a state
of shock. I just don't know.''
   Linda Lee Miller, another of Higgins' sisters who lives in the
Memphis, Tenn., suburb of Bartlett, said she would have a statement
later in the day.
   In Knoxville, Tenn., Leonard Smith, a cousin of Higgins, said of
the report, ``That's just appalling.''
   Smith said he last saw Higgins in the spring of 1987, a few
months before he left for the Middle East. Smith said Higgins was
optimistic about going. m``I don't think he considered it a
particularly high-risk job,'' Smith said.
   Yellow ribbons still fluttered from trees, doors, churches and
schools around Lancaster today _ the town's continuing sign of
sympathy for the hostage and his family.
   ``We just hope that, maybe, what we're hearing is not a fact,''
said florist Julian Moss, a childhood friend of Higgins who helped
launch the ribbon display.

<HEAD>Prime Minister's Convicted Killer Appeals Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christer Pettersson, convicted of
killing Prime Minister Olof Palme and sentenced to life in prison,
asked an appeals court Monday to overturn the judgement.
   The move was widely expected. Arne Liljeros, Pettersson's
attorney, had said he would appeal when the verdict and sentence
were announced Thursday in Stockholm District Court.
   Birgitta Blom, president of Svea Court Of Appeals, said the case
could be heard as early as Sept. 7, the national news agency TT
reported.
   The report gave no specific reason for the appeal, and details
were not expected to be made public until the official documents
reached the appelate court Tuesday or Wednesday.
   Palme, the leading figure in Swedish politics for two decades,
was shot to death Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home with his wife
from a late movie in downtown Stockholm. Pettersson was arrested in
December and convicted after a five-week trial that began June 5.
   Six of the eight-member jury voted to convict. The two
professional judges on the jury, who had equal votes, dissented on
grounds there was not enough hard evidence against Pettersson.
   Several witnesses, including Palme's widow, said they saw
Pettersson shadowing the couple as they left the theater. Lisbeth
Palme identified Pettersson as the man standing near her husband
when he crumpled to the pavement with a fatal wound.
   Jurors said Mrs. Palme's testimony was decisive.
   However, no one testified to seeing Pettersson fire the shots
that killed Palme and grazed his wife. The weapon, a .357-Magnum
revolver, was never found, and no motive for the killing was
established.
   Pettersson, 42, has a record of more than 60 criminal
convictions, including a conviction for manslaughter. He is an
admitted abuser of amphetamines and alcohol who repeatedly was
ordered into psychiatric care.
   ``We want the evidence to be heard again,'' said Lars Ekman,
another Pettersson attorney. ``In the first place that means that
we want all witnesses to be called again,'' including Lisbeth
Palme, he said.

   A man who chained himself to his sofa
for three weeks to stop smoking is a free man today and says it
feels wonderful to have kicked the habit.
   Thomas Warren, 42, on Sunday unlocked the 25-foot steel cable
that had been attached to a 280-pound sofa in his living room and
fashioned around his neck like a dog collar.
   He celebrated his freedom by going out to dinner with friends
and running two miles at midnight.
   ``During the run I felt like a bird,'' said Warren, a former
marathon runner who developed severe respiratory problems from 20
years of smoking. ``My breathing afterward felt smooth and
controlled. You just can't beat that. I feel great.''
   Warren, an artist, dog trainer and drug counselor, had his
friends chain him July 9. He had tried several methods to break his
pack-a-day habit, including acupuncture, Smokers Anonymous and
meditation.
   ``In my hometown, everyone who knew me laughed and thought I
really was a ridiculous person for doing this,'' Warren said. ``But
the reward is what this did for other people around the world with
smoking addictions. I feel like a millionaire.''
   Warren conceded it will be a daily fight to quit smoking for
good.
   ``But I'm not going to allow myself to,'' he said. ``I have the
power to say no.''

<TEXT>
   Twice a day, state Rep. Dennis Dutko picks
up a pay phone in the Ingham County Jail and calls his office to
check on the latest from the Capitol or his constituents.
   Since his one-year sentence began May 24 for a third drunken
driving conviction, the eight-term Democrat has represented his
suburban Detroit district from his jail cell.
   Even his staff questions how effective he is from behind bars.
   ``Because he doesn't have a vote, to tell you that he does have
an impact on the House would be to distort the situation,'' Dutko
aide Paul Mendelsohn said.
   Upon conviction, the 45-year-old bachelor was stripped of his
chairmanship of the House committee on colleges and universities
and the chairmanship of a subcommittee on long-term and
supplemental Medicare insurance.
   A week after being jailed, Dutko said he would resign July 1. He
then reneged, saying he would wait until the legislature returns to
Lansing on Sept. 15, after a recess that began last Fridy.
Meanwhile, attorneys are trying to appeal his convictions.
   Dutko still receives his $42,670 annual salary, but has said he
will donate it to alcohol treatment programs while he's in jail.
The Michigan Legislature is a full-time job, and he had no other
employment.
   Dutko's House colleagues urged him to step down after he was
jailed, but they have avoided trying to oust him, apparently
reluctant to break ranks.
   ``My view is he's an embarrassment to the city,'' said GOP
precinct delegate William Sears, who started an effort to have
Dutko recalled. ``The city has been without a voice in Lansing. He
did not even participate in the state budget.''
   But the recall petition drive has suffered from a lack of
interest. A dozen people showed up for the first informational
meeting.
   State Attorney General Frank Kelley says that because Dutko was
convicted of a misdemeanor instead of a felony, no state law forces
him to quit the legislature.
   Dutko is believed to be the nation's only legislator holding
onto his job while serving a jail sentence, according to Rich
Jones, director of legislative programs for the National Conference
of State Legislatures in Denver.
   Mendelsohn and another aide, Darren Campbell, sign their own
names when responding to letters written to Dutko's office. They
also are producing a district newsletter Dutko used to write.
   ``We've been handed a lot of control over what happens in the
office,'' Mendelsohn said. Dutko refused comment.
   Paper work and briefing material must be mailed to Dutko. The
only hand-delivered packages he can accept contain white socks and
underwear.
   The Michigan chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and a
small faction of constituents circulating the recall petition have
been vocal about Dutko's actions.
   But most people express little interest in the case.
   ``It's something that people have been reading about, but it's
not something they are upset about,'' said Michael Raveane, editor
of the Warren Weekly, distributed free to 60,000 homes.
   Raveane says a majority of letters to the editor on Dutko's
incarceration have been sympathetic.
   ``I don't condone what he's doing, but I don't like to see his
career ruined over it,'' said Tom Calder, 29, an attorney. ``If he
can't do his job properly from jail, he should give it up. But it's
a shame he would have to give it up that way.''
   Dutko's 30 minutes of visiting time per week usually is reserved
for his mother, Phyllis. House Speaker Lewis Dodak and some other
colleagues also have visited.
   Like any other inmate, Dutko has unlimited phone access, as long
as the calls are local or collect.

   A TV crew filming a re-enactment of a
rescue got some real-life footage when a 9-year-old who spent a
cold, rainy night lost on a mountain was reunited with his family.
   Ian Hawthorne, who had wandered off to go exploring Saturday in
the resort area, was spotted Sunday from the air, 1\ miles from
where he disappeared, by a helicopter pilot for KUSA-TV in Denver.
   Pilot Peter Peelgrane picked up the boy and flew him to
paramedics, who found Ian cold and hungry but in good condition.
   A CBS crew that was in the area to film a re-enactment for the
show ``Rescue 911'' ended up getting footage of Ian's reunion with
his family. ``Rescue 911'' is scheduled to debut as a weekly series
this fall.
   ``They just flipped that they were able to get the real thing,''
said Arapahoe Rescue Patrol chief Stan Bush.
   The CBS crew was restaging the June 11 rescue of two girls, ages
9 and 11, who spent a night in the woods before being spotted by a
helicopter.

   Senators offered John A. Knauss a cordial
welcome on Monday and urged him to be aggressive as head of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``The average NOAA administrator has been chosen because he
could keep his mouth shut. I hope you will get excited. ...'' Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., told the University of Rhode Island
professor.
   Knauss told the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation that he hopes to press a broad ocean-coastal
initiative and to encourage research on global warming, the ozone
hole and other atmospheric problems.
   ``Never have NOAA's responsibilities been more important than
they are today. ... For an earth scientist, these are exciting
times as we try to understand and predict the ecological
consequences of the actions of the world's rapidly increasing
population,'' Knauss told the committee.
   Scientific research on the effects of the Alaskan oil spill
could last as long as five years, Knauss confirmed.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, urged him to give close attention to
the costs of such work, with the aim of making sure that those
responsible for spills are charged for the costs.
   NOAA scientists have done an excellent job in assisting in
easing the impacts of spills in Alaska, Delaware, Texas and
elsewhere, said Stevens. But the costs for this work need to be
borne by those at fault, he added.
   Hollings said money is a major factor in this era of tight
budgets, and he indicated that he feels that the Commerce
Department _ parent agency for NOAA _ may not be aggressive enough
in seeking funds for the weather and environmental agency.
   ``You've got to be a promoter and get the public and the
endowments and particularly the administration interested in your
endeavors,'' Hollings encouraged Knauss.
   Hollings said he hopes that the nomination of Knauss to head
NOAA can be voted on this week.
   Knauss, an oceanographer, was a member of the commission that
recommended creation of NOAA nearly two decades ago.
   NOAA, with a $1 billion budget, operates the National Weather
Service, conducts climate, weather and ocean research, manages the
Sea Grant college program, and includes the National Ocean Service,
National Marine Fisheries Service, the Sea Grant college program
and National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service.

   A man whose ex-wife had been dating the
publisher of the Atchison Daily Globe was arrested today in the
news executive's slaying.
   Lloyd S. Heaver, 40, was booked on charges of murder in the
shooting death Saturday of Larry Sarvey, police said.
   Police Chief Ron Pickman said Heaver was divorced last month
from Sandi Heaver, an advertising representative at the newspaper.
She had been dating Sarvey, the Globe's 38-year-old publisher and
general manager.
   Sarvey's body was found in his home Saturday. Pickman said he
had been shot at least twice in the head with a shotgun. Screens on
the front and rear doors had been cut, and the telephone line
outside was severed, police said.
   Sarvey, who was divorced and lived alone, became publisher of
the Globe in February 1988. The paper is owned by Thomson
Newspapers Inc. Sarvey was previously marketing director for Brehm
Communications in Fort Madison, Iowa.
   He served in the Army in Vietnam and attended Broome Community
College in Binghamton, N.Y.
   Survivors include daughters Jill, Renay, Sarah and Veronica, all
of Binghamton, N.Y., and a son, Chris.

   As the tour bus swung through town, a
guide pointed out sites of historical significance: a gas station
with free-standing pumps, roadside cabins outlined in pink neon and
a drive-up hot dog stand.
   Conventional historic sites barely got a second glance. The
gawkers were historic preservation experts attending a conference
on roadside architecture and commercial archaeology.
   ``Archaeologists are seen as explorers of lost civilization,''
explains Mike Jackson of the state Historic Preservation Agency,
who led the tour. ``Essentially that's what we're doing, only we're
looking for the lost culture of the roadside ... lost by layers of
later development.''
   Jackson, an architect, is also a past president of the Society
for Commercial Archaeology, which studies the artifacts, symbols
and buildings of American commerce _ the gas stations, motels and
coffee shops, not to mention neon signs.
   He was host of the 1989 Midwest State Historic Preservation
Officers' Conference session that toured old Route 66 in
Springfield Thursday.
   ``If you have a generation without a sense of its history, you
have these people who ... are culturally lost,'' Jackson said.
   When the history of the 20th century is written, Jackson says,
it will tell how the automobile changed American life, and how the
transition from two-lane roads to interstate highways changed the
experience of travel by car.
   ``The interstate totally isolates you from everything but the
driving experience,'' he said.
   ``When you took the older highway anyplace along the route there
could be something that you could interact with, stop and get off
the road. ... The sense of adventure when you got to town was
there; speed wasn't the issue.''
   The number of small roadside motels, cabin courts and gas
stations that clustered along roads like Route 66 has dwindled
along with the traffic.
   One leg of Route 66, the main entryway to Springfield from the
north, once had lodging places and a gas station every half-block,
Jackson said. But most have been leveled or converted to another
use.
   He pointed out a 1920s-era building that was built as a Texaco
station, then converted into an Irish tavern and is now a popular
Thai restaurant. He called it ``typical of the process of the
evolution of the roadside.''
   A few landmarks don't seem to have changed at all.
   Across the road from the restaurant is the Haven Motel, which
Jackson said dates from the 1930s. For $15 a night, visitors can
stay in weathered roadside cottages with gabled roofs outlined in
pink neon lights.
   Jackson said gas stations and motels are just starting to show
up on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``The historic tool of the National Register of Historic Places
has as its purpose to represent examples of the American past,'' he
said. ``It's not an elitist tool. It's not just the homes of the
presidents. All kinds of buildings are supposed to be represented.''
   The tour of roadside architecture puzzled at least one
Springfield local, in a town that draws tourists for its Abraham
Lincoln memorabilia.
   ``This is a first,'' remarked the bus driver.

   Who was that masked man?
   For 13 years it was favorite son Brace Beemer who shouted
``Hi-ho, Silver!'' as radio's Lone Ranger, and an official wants to
make sure that Oxford visitors know it.
   Village Attorney Robert Bunting has proposed an equestrian
statue honoring Beemer, who lived on a farm outside Oxford until
his death in 1965. The community, 40 miles northwest of Detroit,
already has a museum displaying a white hat, silver spurs and black
mask.
   ``It's a worthwhile American legend, and I'd like to see it
promoted,'' said Bunting, who is trying to raise $65,000 for a
bronze statue of the Lone Ranger and his horse, Silver, by Florida
sculptor Frank Varga. Bunting already has 16 $1,000 pledges.
   The Lone Ranger began its two-decade radio run in 1933,
originating from WXYZ in Detroit. Beemer played the character from
1941-54.

hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.N. peacekeeper,
provoked ``outrage and revulsion'' today from Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Also today, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution
that ``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and
abduction,'' and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
denounced Israel's capture of a Shiite cleric.
   The Security Council was also scheduled today to extend for six
months the mandate of its peacekeepers in Lebanon, the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon.
   Higgins' Shiite captors announced today that they carried out
their threat to hang him and issued a videotape purporting to show
his slaying.
   The U.N. chief's spokesman, Juan-Carlos Brandt, said that if the
report is confirmed, ``the secretary-general can only express his
outrage and revulsion at the fact that an innocent man serving the
United Nations in the cause of peace should be murdered in this
fashion,'' said Brandt.
   The resolution, which has been debated in private in the council
for weeks, ``demands the immediate safe release of all hostages and
abducted persons wherever and by whomever they are being held.''
   It calls on all nations to use their political influence for the
release of hostages, and urges international cooperation to
``facilitate the prevention, prosecution and punishment of all acts
of hostage-taking and abduction as manifestations of terrorism.''
   Higgins, 44, was serving as head of an observer group attached
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was seized
Feb. 17, 1988.
   Higgins' captors, a shadowy pro-Iranian group called the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, accused him of spying for
the CIA.
   The kidnappers said they would hang him today unless Israel
freed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, an influential Shiite Moslem cleric
captured by Israeli troops three days ago. Perez de Cuellar
condemned Obeid's capture.
   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factions
believed to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine of them
Americans.
   Lebanese security sources and Israeli officials say Obeid played
a role in the kidnapping of Higgins last year, but Obeid denies it.

<HEAD>Velayati Outlines Iranian Foreign Policy Under New President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
indicated Monday there will be no dramatic change in foreign policy
when President-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani takes over, including in
Iran's attitude toward the United States.
   Velayati told a news conference Iran would like to resume
relations ``with all countries with which there is no hurdle in
re-establishing ties.
   ``But the United States is another matter,'' he said. ``The
Americans adopted a hostile policy towards us from the very
beginning, and they have continued this policy.''
   Rafsanjani, 54, emerged as Iran's new strongman after the June 3
death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and won an overwhelming 94.5
percent of votes in Friday's presidential election.
   He will become the country's most powerful leader under
constitutional changes supported by Iranians in a referendum also
held Friday.
   Velayati said Rafsanjani ``has said many times before that when
the United States abandons hostility toward us and returns our
confiscated properties, it will have shown its good will.''
   Rafsanjani, speaker of the 270-member parliament or Majlis, has
said U.S. expressions of ``good will'' would lead to better ties
and allow Iran to use its influence to free U.S. hostages believed
held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   Iran's assets in the United States were frozen and Washington
severed diplomatic ties after Iranian militants stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in September 1981 and held 52 Americans hostage
for 444 days.
   Most of the frozen assets, Iran claims, are in the form of
weapons ordered from the United States and paid for but never
delivered after the 1979 ouster of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Tehran claims they total $11 billion.
   Velayati said bilateral relations will be the main topic when
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived in Tehran
later Monday.
   Despite its official non-aligned policy of ``neither East nor
West,'' which Velayati said will continue, Iran's recent
confrontations with the West have moved it closer to its northern
neighbor, the Soviet Union.
   Improved ties between Tehran and Moscow were highlighted by
Rafsanjani's trip to Moscow last month, where he signed agreements
worth $6 billion, including an arms deal to replenish Iran's
depleted military hardware.
   Rafsanjani, a so-called pragmatist in the Iranian hierarchy, is
expected to steer the country gradually away from hostility toward
the West laid down by Khomeini when he founded the Islamic Republic.
   Under a new foreign policy forged by Rafsanjani, Tehran's ties
with the West gradually improved after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in
Iran's eight-year war with Iraq.
   But Khomeini ended Rafsanjani's efforts in February with a death
decree against Indian-born British writer Salman Rushdie.
   Khomeini's religious decree said Rushdie should be sought out
and killed for blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Canada, Sweden and European Community members called their
ambassadors home in protest, and Tehran reacted by withdrawing its
envoys from the 14 countries.
   The ambassadors gradually have returned to their missions. But
Tehran severed ties with Britain over the affair and the death
decree stands.
   Velayati told reporters that resuming relations with Britain is
possible only within the framework of a law passed in February that
calls for the British government to reverse opposition to the death
edict, ban ``The Satanic Verses,'' and destroy existing copies of
the book there.
   ``What the imam pronounced was a basic principle, and there is
no compromise on this,'' Velayati said. Iranians regarded Khomeini
as their supreme religious leader, or imam.
   Velayati said he also will discuss with Shevardnadze
implementation of a U.N. resolution to bring lasting peace between
Iran and Iraq. Peace talks between the two countries are deadlocked.

   An oil rig capsized today as it headed inland
to escape a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, and as many as nine
workers were feared trapped inside, the Coast Guard said.
   Four of the 13 workers believed to have been aboard were plucked
from the water by fishermen and a Coast Guard helicopter, said
Chief Petty Officer Michael Robling. The Coast Guard said two
others were picked up, but later said it could not confirm that.
   Petty Officer Steve Guy said some workers ``may be trapped
inside the rig below the surface of the water.''
   The rig, a self-propelled vessel with legs that can extend to
sea floor, is of a type in which the crew quarters can be sealed,
said Lt. Steve Hardy. It wasn't known if the missing workers were
in a sealed section, he said.
   ``They usually have watertight doors which should have been
secured if the vessel was under way,'' Hardy said.
   Air trapped inside would be the only oxygen for any survivors,
Hardy said. He said he couldn't estimate how long the air supply
would last.
   Rescue efforts were hampered by 10-foot seas, 35 mph wind and
heavy rain from the fringes of Tropical Storm Chantal. The Coast
Guard flew divers to the rig, and helicopters and a patrol boat
were dispatched.
   The vessel, leased to Chevron Oil Corp., had been ordered ashore
because of the storm, said spokesman Jonathan Lifa.
   The rig was in about 25 feet of water 25 miles off Morgan City.
The accident was reported about 5:20 a.m.
   ``We have no idea how it capsized. The workers on the rig are
suspected to have been asleep'' when the rig fell over, Guy said.
   Seas were about 3 feet when the order came to move, but the
weather at the time wasn't known, said Lifa.
   Hardy said that the Coast Guard recently began inspections of
such vessels because of a ``significant casualty rate'' from
accidents. He said the rig's owners had met today's deadline for
applying for an inspection.
   Petty Officer Rich Muller said the rig belonged to Lafayette
Lift Boat and was managed by Avis Boug Co. of Folsom.
   Lafayette has no listing, and a woman who answered the phone at
Avis said officials were on their way to the scene and unavailable
to comment.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, endorsed by the
Communist Party for prime minister, is both head of Poland's police
forces and initiator of talks with the Solidarity union that he was
responsible for suppressing.
   State media announced Monday the Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party has backed Kiszczak for prime minister to succeed
new party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   If Kiszczak is also supported by the minor partners in the
communist coalition, the Peasant and Democratic parties, then his
election by the parliament would seem assured. But in Poland's
changing political landscape, nothing could be ruled out.
   Once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns on
dissidents, Kiszczak emerged as a valuable negotiating partner for
the opposition in two months of talks that resulted in Solidarity's
legalization and partially free elections.
   The 63-year-old army general, who has been Interior Minister
since 1981, donned a civilian suit for the talks and often drove
his red Peugeot to a palace in downtown Warsaw where negotiations
were held.
   With a mixture of charm and toughness, Kiszczak quickly
impressed union negotiators. He disarmed underground writers by
praising their essays, which his investigators had presumably
confiscated.
   It was Kiszczak who made the proposal for talks with the
opposition on political and economic reform a year ago during a
wave of nationwide strikes, Poland's worst labor unrest in seven
years.
   Walesa refused to commit Solidarity to talks without a pledge
that the union would be legalized. In a dramatic reversal,
Jaruzelski pushed through an offer to restore the union's legal
status at a party plenum in January.
   Three weeks later, as chief negotiator for the government side,
Kiszczak opened the round table. Agreements reached April 5 led to
legalization of Solidarity and partially free elections in which
Solidarity scored dazzling victories July 4 and July 18.
   But Kiszczak was one of 33 out of 35 top government and party
officials who ran unopposed on a national slate but failed to get
the required 50 percent of votes cast.
   Kiszczak's relations with the opposition were not always so
cordial.
   Along with Jaruzelski and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki,
Kiszczak helped execute the December 1981 martial-law crackdown in
which thousands of Solidarity activists were rounded up and
imprisoned.
   Three years later, Interior Ministry security police on his
payroll murdered the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a pro-Solidarity
priest who had kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly Masses
for the homeland at his Warsaw parish.
   Kiszczak saw that the four officers were convicted of murder,
but the trial stopped short of revealing any higher-level
involvement, which some opposition members still suspect.
   As head of the ministry responsible for containing the
opposition which flourished underground after martial law, Kiszczak
developed a deep knowledge of Solidarity.
   One leading Solidarity activist who has spent years in jail for
opposition activity recently joked that one of the best collections
of underground literature can be found in the ministry's basement.
   Born in 1925, Kiszczak's war experiences contributed to the
evolution of a tough young officer.
   Shipped by the Nazis to work as a forced laborer in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw, then known by its German name of
Breslau, Kiszczak escaped and made his way to communist resistance
forces in Austria.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1945 and helped in the campaign
against Polish partisans opposed to the imposition of communist
rule.
   Kiszczak later attende the Voroshilov Academy of the Soviet
armed forces in Moscow and was promoted to general in 1973. He
served as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 and
head of the military police in the Ministry of National Defense
between 1979 and 1981.
   Jaruzelski named Kiszczak head of the Interior Ministry in
August 1981.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch has drawn closer to
Democratic challenger David Dinkins in the mayoral race, while
support for Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani has declined, a poll has
found.
   Koch continued to be rated unfavorably by more New Yorkers than
rated him favorably in the Gallup poll conducted July 21-24 for New
York Newsday. But his approval rating rose for the first time in
the Newsday poll since December.
   For the Democratic nomination, Manhattan Borough President
Dinkins had 41 percent support to 34 percent for Koch, 7 percent
for City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and 4 percent for former
transit chief Richard Ravitch. Fourteen percent were undecided.
   The Dinkins-Koch split was within the margin of error of 4
points for the 671 Democrats polled. Dinkins led Koch 38-28 in a
Newsday poll in late April and early May, and 45-31 in a Daily
News-Eyewitness News poll in early July.
   Giuliani, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, was in a
statistical dead heat with Koch in a hypothetical matchup, with 40
percent support for Koch and 37 percent for Giuliani. The former
federal prosecutor led Koch 49-33 in the early July poll and 51-27
in the April-May survey.
   Among the 1,014 registered voters in the new poll, 36 percent
approved of the way Koch was doing his job as mayor, while 44
percent disapproved. The rest had no opinion. That rating was
improved from 28-52 percent in the April-May poll. In the early
July poll, Koch's approval rating was 37-58.
   A Koch spokesman, Larry Simonberg, said the mayor's TV
advertising and campaign appearances had improved his standing.
``When people get a chance to talk with him in the flesh, the
effect is very positive for the mayor,'' Simonberg said.
   Giuliani spokesman Charles Perkins told Newsday that $8 million
in negative advertising by Republican rival Ronald Lauder had hurt
Giuliani. Giuliani led Lauder strongly nonetheless.
   The primary is Sept. 12.

   Fire bosses called in the Army today to help battle blazes that
have overrun a mountain hamlet in Idaho, menaced remote Oregon
ranches and destroyed thousands of acres of forest and range
elsewhere in the West.
   Hundreds of wildfires _ most caused by lightning last week _
have blackened about 90,000 acres in five states since Wednesday.
   More than 9,700 firefighters were on the lines around the
biggest blazes, said the Boise (Idaho) Interagency Fire Center, the
nation's wildfire command post.
   With firefighting forces in the West almost completely
mobilized, the agency called on the Army and crews from other
regions for reinforcements.
   Hundreds of firefighters were being flown into the command
center from Alaska, the East, Southeast and Southwest, spokesman
Ron Smith said. Soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were sent to Boise
for training before being dispatched to the fire lines.
   Residents of Lowman, Idaho, were finally allowed to return to
the tiny mountain retreat today.
   A firestorm that swept through the Boise National Forest late
Saturday and early Sunday destroyed 25 structures in the town,
which has a year-round population of about 15 but attracts summer
visitors from Boise, 60 miles to the southwest.
   A combination motel, campground and convenience store was lost,
as were houses, trailer homes and outbuildings.
   ``My husband left in shorts and no shirt,'' said 70-year-old
Daisy Oliver, whose mobile home was reduced to blackened metal
scrap. ``We didn't get anything, just what we had on our backs. ...
I don't know where we'll go from here.''
   No injuries were reported in the fire, one of several big blazes
burning out of control in Idaho. The fires consumed a total of
40,000 acres of forest and range and were being fought today by
4,000 firefighters.
   The Oregon fire, near Baker and about 50 miles from the Idaho
state line, grew from about 5,000 acres on Saturday to at least
17,000 acres today. It was one of five major fires out of control
in eastern Oregon.
   ``You look out the window here and there's columns of smoke in
every direction,'' Kathy Aplin, spokeswoman for the Oregon
Department of Forestry in Baker, said Sunday evening.
   About 30 families were evacuated Saturday night, but all but 10
were allowed to return today. Gusts to 22 mph threatened to spread
flames to those homes, said Kathy Aplin, spokeswoman for the Oregon
Department of Forestry.
   Ranchers cut fences and opened gates to let their cattle and
sheep escape as flames threatened grazing lands, said Ken Dunleavy,
a spokesman for the Baker County sheriff.
   ``They're trying to get their livestock out of there like
crazy,'' he said.
   About 1,200 firefighters battled the fire. An air tanker dropped
fire retardant on one ranch home, and a bulldozer plowed a
firebreak through the front yard of another.
   Some 2,000 firefighters fought at least four other major forest
fires and several smaller blazes in eastern Oregon. A 1,300-acre
fire threatened the watershed that is the main water supply for La
Grande, a community of 11,000 in northeastern Oregon. In all, fire
burned about 42,000 acres in Oregon in recent days.
   In the central Sierra Nevada foothills of California,
investigators said an arsonist lit a fire that has raged out of
control for three days, destroying seven homes and filling the area
around Auberry with thick smoke.
   The blaze, dubbed the Powerhouse fire, about 200 miles east of
San Francisco, also destroyed 16 outbuildings and scorched 11,350
tinder-dry acres.
   By late Sunday, about 1,900 firefighters had encircled 60
percent of the blaze and expected containment by evening. Three
firefighters were injured, none seriously.
   Some of the 2,500 people forced to evacuate were allowed back in
their homes. Many roads remained closed.
   A fire in the Balch Camp area, 15 to 20 miles southeast of the
Powerhouse fire, had blackened about 23,000 acres since it flared
up Saturday. It was only 5 percent contained Sunday but threatened
no buildings in the remote wildland area on rough terrain, said
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Becky Armstrong.
   In southern California, a 5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland
National Forest raged out of control early today, but a 1,200-acre
brush fire about 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles that had earlier
forced 100 people was brought under control.
   The Los Angeles County fire on Sunday burned a hog farm that had
previously been used as a toxic waste dump.
   Firefighters also mopped up a stubborn 10,500-acre wildfire near
Atascadero, in central California, that had burned since late last
week. It was expected to be controlled sometime today.
   About 900 firefighters saved 13 homes and structures in the
Cleveland forest blaze Sunday, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Rosalinda Ewen. A house and a trailer were destroyed.
   In Washington, a forest fire in the northern Cascade mountains
was held to 800 acres Sunday. Firefighters reported the blaze in
the Okanogan National Forest 55 percent contained, said U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Greg Thayer.
   In western Montana, near the Idaho state line, lightning set
several dozen small fires over the weekend. The largest blaze, near
the Idaho border, grew to about 60 acres overnight, forest
dispatcher Nick Nicholson said today.

   Besides eight Americans still held
hostage and at least two who were killed, five other Americans were
kidnapped in Lebanon over the past 5{ years and eventually gained
their freedom.
   Here is a brief review:
   _Frank Regier, an engineering professor at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted Feb. 10, 1984, near the west
Beirut campus. On April 15, 1984, he and another kidnap victim,
Christian Joubert, a French housing specialist, were freed. Members
of Lebanon's Shiite Amal militia said they had rescued the pair,
but the circumstances of their release and the identity of their
captors were never made clear.
   _Jeremy Levin, Beirut bureau chief for Cable News Network, was
kidnapped March 7, 1984, as he walked to work in west Beirut. The
pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. On Feb. 14,
1985, Levin turned up in Damascus, Syria, and said he had escaped
from solitary confinement in east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. But
Islamic Jihad asserted it actually had released the TV
correspondent.
   _Presbyterian pastor Benjamin Weir was kidnapped May 8, 1984, on
a west Beirut street. On Sept. 9, 1985, Weir was freed by his
Islamic Jihad captors, bearing a message calling for urgent U.S.
action to meet demands for the release of 17 Islamic Jihad comrades
jailed in Kuwait for the December 1983 bombing of the U.S. and
French embassies there.
   _The Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest, was abducted
from his car in Beirut on Jan. 8, 1985. He was released by Islamic
Jihad on July 26, 1986, bringing with him a videotape in which
fellow hostage David P. Jacobsen appealed for the U.S. government
to negotiate with the kidnappers.
   _David P. Jacobsen, American director of American University
Hospital, was kidnapped May 28, 1985, as he walked to work in west
Beirut. He was released by Islamic Jihad on Nov. 2, 1986.
Jacobsen's release led to disclosures that the Reagan
administration had been negotiating for the hostages' freedom and
had arranged secret arms shipments to Iran, a development that
provoked a political storm in Washington that became known as the
Iran-Contra affair.
   In addition, over the past 5{ years at least 34 other
foreigners, including French, West German and British nationals,
have been kidnapped in Lebanon and either were freed, escaped or
were rescued.

<TEXT>
   The interior minister of Cuba has been jailed
on charges of corruption two weeks after its government executed
four officers charged with drug trafficking, official Cuban reports
said today.
   Interior Minister Jose Abrantes Fernandez and four other people,
including a brigadier general, were jailed, the official Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina said quoting the official Granma newspaper. It
did not say when the arrests occurred.
   It said Abrantes was removed from his post as interior minister,
but it did not say who will replace him.
   In addition, five other generals were demoted to colonels and
retired in the ``reordering of the Interior Ministry and
rectification of errors and negative tendencies,'' Granma said.
   Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other officers were executed July
13 after being found guilty of drug smuggling and other offenses in
a major Cuban drug scandal. Ten other people are serving prison
terms that range from 10 to 30 years.
   Prensa Latina said Monday that ``evidence of the transgressions
and violations of law have become evident.''
   It quoted Granma as saying it was necessary ``to radically
rectify the tendencies and conduct incompatible with the laws of
our society, such as negligence of duty, corruption, or tolerance
of corrupt behavior, improper use of resources ....'' However, it
gave no details.
   It identified the others detained as Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez
Caso, former chief of immigration; Oscar Carreno Gomez, former head
of customs; Lt. Col. Rolando Castaneda Izquierdo; and Hector
Carbonell Mendez, former director of a company involved in
international transactions.

of 13 doctors from Memorial Hospital in South Bend.
   So far this season, the Dox have shown more brains than brawn,
with a record of 5-7.
   But winning's not the point.
   ``It's a pressure relief valve. We're coming to have a good
time. We try to avoid getting hurt. We really don't expect to win,
but when we do it's a bonus,'' said Dr. Robert White, a
neonatologist who was exhausted during a recent game because he was
up most of the night delivering a baby.
   The Dox have come a long way from their first season in 1982,
when they finished 1-15 and were widely hailed as the worst team in
South Bend's worst softball league.
   The Dox never practice during the season and their only
preseason drill consists of the team captain hitting balls to a
couple of players.
   ``It's no lie that for many guys the first ball they hit in a
year is the first ball that's pitched to them the first game of the
season,'' said Dr. Joe Caruso, the team captain and a
family-practice physician.
   Team practice is impractical, he explained, because of the
doctors' busy schedules.
   And thanks to the beepers and the cellular phone, the Dox
occasionally have to forfeit a game when their bench loses too many
players who must respond to emergencies.

   Usually, they are ashamed. But scores
of people with unusually smelly feet turned out for a contest to
see whose sneakers were the most disgusting of all.
   Herbert ``Buddy'' Lapidus, head of research for Combe Inc.,
developer of Odor-Eaters shoe inserts and corporate sponsor of the
event, said he was looking for sneakers that would satisfy his
``10-foot formula.''
   ``If I can smell them from 10 feet away, they're in the running;
15 feet, a definite contender; 20 feet, a ferocious shoe-in,'' he
said.
   The winner of Sunday's contest was 13-year-old Jason Koch of
Salisbury, who brought the pair of sneakers he wears while riding
his dirt bike on hot summer days.
   ``They were filthy, rotten, dirty, full of holes and they stunk
really bad,'' said Joan Martin, co-chairwoman of the event.
   Lapidus said the panel of three judges consisted of true experts
in rotten sneakers: a mother, a junior high school athletic coach,
and a dog.

   The weather didn't cooperate with the
spirit of the festivities, but residents put up with the sunshine
and 80-degree temperature to celebrate their annual ``Rain Day.''
   Rain has fallen on July 29 in 94 out of the past 114 years in
Waynesburg, a community of 5,000 about 35 miles south of
Pittsburgh. Of the rainless Rain Days, six occurred in the last

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beba Wassef recalls that their whole
neighborhood in Detroit celebrated when she, her husband, Yussef,
and their sons, Samir and Sami, became Americans 16 years ago.
   ``I remember the food. I remember there were a lot of Egyptians
and Americans,'' she said. ``But most of all, I remember the
excitement on the boys' faces when they helped hoist a huge
American flag in the backyard.''
   Samir was 14, Sami 10.
   Today, Samir, now 30, is a Michigan pediatrician, and Sami, 26,
is a 1988 graduate of Cairo University's Medical School.
   But Sami has had to postpone career plans. He has spent the past
8{ months in an Egyptian prison and was formally charged only three
weeks ago. An Egyptian court says he is an American spy.
   On July 20, Mrs. Wassef listened as Prosecutor General Aly
Hawari accused her sons of being CIA agents.
   He said the brothers sold Nicholas Edward Reynolds, also accused
of spying for the United States, information on Islamic
fundamentalism and other non-military issues. They were found
guilty of passing on more information than they could have learned
from newspapers about economic problems, religious fundamentalism
and tensions between Egypt's majority Moslems and Coptic Christians.
   The court said nothing specific about how the information was
obtained or allegedly passed on. Nor did it indicate that Egypt's
national security was damaged.
   All three men were convicted, but only Sami was in Egypt and
only Sami is in jail.
   Mrs. Wassef has spent much of this year in her native Egypt
seeking help for Sami. Both say the prosecutor's charge is absurd.
   She said her sons reported on non-military topics to a man they
knew as ``Tony,'' gleaning the information mostly from a local
English-language newspaper. They were told it would appear in Cairo
Today, an English-language magazine aimed at expatriates in the
Egyptian capital, she said.
   Not only is Sami not a spy, Mrs. Wassef said, but ``he was such
a bad reporter that Tony fired him for giving him only nonsense.
That was more than two years ago.
   ``If the Egyptians really wanted to find a spy, they surely
could do it inside the American Embassy,'' she said.
   ``Sami is an American. He entered Egypt on his American
passport. And nobody _ not the embassy, not the State Department,
not the White House _ nobody has helped him. We've contacted all of
them.
   ``Maybe if he'd been a spy, they might have helped him.''
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba only would comment that
``The American Embassy has done everything it can for Mrs. Wassef
and her son. We offer to all Americans normal consular services.''
   Mrs. Wassef said Consul General Conrad Drescher first visited
her son Dec. 8, three weeks after plainclothes security men
arrested him. By that time Wassef had signed a 253-page confession,
written in Arabic, which his mother says he can barely read.
   His medical courses and textbooks were in English.
   Wassef told his mother that investigators fabricated much of his
confession. He signed it, he said, because he was told his luggage
and an airline ticket to the United States were ``just outside the
door'' if he cooperated.
   He and his mother claim to have been told the case was
prosecuted in order to facilitate the release of Abdelkader Helmy,
an Egyptian-born American rocket scientist who has pleaded guilty
in Sacramento, Calif., to charges he illegally procured military
technology in the United States.
   During the eight months that Wassef was held without charge,
U.S. officials never mentioned the case publicly.
   However, the Wassefs' congressman has been working on it
privately, even to approaching Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``We're doing everything possible to help Sami Wassef,'' an aide
to Rep. William S. Broomfield, R-Mich., said in Washington. ``We're
very concerned about health conditions in the prison.''
   Mrs. Wassef said that in March, four months after her son's
arrest and four months before he was charged, Broomfield slipped
Mubarak a note about the case while the Egyptian leader was on an
official visit to the United States. Nothing happened.
   Although appeals remain possible, Mrs. Wassef said Mubarak
represents her son's only hope. She said U.S. Ambassador Frank G.
Wisner, whom she visited after the verdict, told her to be patient
and promised to try and get her an audience with the Egyptian
president.
   The Wassef family is Christian. Reynolds told friends in Egypt
he worked with Sobek Travel, which has offices in Oakland and
Angel's Camp, Calif.
   In Angels Camp, John Yost, a Sobek owner, said Reynolds worked
two or three years ago as a consultant for a film company
associated with the tour group.
   He said he never met Reynolds, didn't know where he was from and
doesn't know where he is now. Yost gave Reynold's parents hometown
as Chevy Chase, Md.
   Summing up after a 90-minute trial, Hawari urged the three
judges to ``have no mercy,'' to make the Wassefs ''an example to
others.''
   Each brother was sentenced to 10 years and a fine. Reynolds was
fined and sentenced to five years.
   ``They had Sami in a cage in the courtroom. All he could do was
stand there and hold onto the wires and shout that he was
innocent,'' Mrs. Wassef said.
   ``I can't sleep. When I close my eyes, I see his face in the
cage.''

   A zookeeper was reported in good condition
Monday after being trampled by a sick 4,100-pound African elephant
he was trying to treat.
   Henry Kacprzyk, 35, suffered a broken right leg, cuts and
bruises in Friday's incident at the Pittsburgh Zoo and was taken to
Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   Officials said Tribby, an African elephant, was suffering from
diarrhea caused by eating too much dirt.
   Kacprzyk and another zookeeper were trying to chain two of the
elephant's legs before giving her extra water, medicine and
high-fiber food when she began kicking Kacprzyk several times with
one of her hind legs.
   ``It's one of those things,'' Kacprzyk said. ``All elephants are
individuals, just like people. ... What really happened (is) she
got fed up with the treatments.''
   The elephant was feeling better this week, said zoo Director
Charles Wikenhauser.

   Maybe it's the color or the make, but two

Subarus.
   Sunday morning Mrs. Chisholm told her husband it was time to go
to the hospital in Manchester.
   But the drive from Merrimack was interrupted two miles from home
with an urgent stop by the road in Bedford and the arrival of a
7-pound, 10-ounce daughter in the front seat of their blue 1987
Subaru.
   ``The baby was sliding out. All I could do was catch her,''
Chisholm said.
   It was deja vu for the couple, who 2{ years ago delivered a son
in the back of their old blue Subaru.
   ``It's a lot easier to take the second time around,'' Chisholm
said.
   ``It was just very easy,'' his wife said. ``I wish everyone
could have kids that easy, but I was still surprised that it went
that quick.''
   Their daughter, yet to be named, has two older brothers,
Christopher, 6, and Paul, the first Subaru arrival.
   When Paul was born, it was 30 degrees and the wind was blowing.
``This birth was more pleasant than the last time,'' Chisholm said.
   Mrs. Chisholm, 30, is studying for her master's degree in early
childhood development at the University of New Hampshire and
teaches part-time at Hesser College. Her husband, 33, has been laid
off from his job with a Massachusetts firm.

   Pete Rose suffered a setback today when a
federal judge decided his lawsuit against baseball Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti belongs in federal court.
   U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh refused to return Rose's
case to Hamilton County Common Pleas Court, where Rose had won an
order tying Giamatti's hands in deciding whether the Cincinnati
Reds manager bet on ballgames.
   Baseball wanted the case heard in federal court, where judges
have upheld the commissioner's broad powers in previous legal
challenges.
   Rose had asked that the matter be kept in Common Pleas Court in
the Reds' hometown, where Judge Norbert A. Nadel has shown a
willingness to go into what he termed ``uncharted waters'' in
making his decisions.
   ``It's certainly a victory that puts the case in the right
court,'' said Louis L. Hoynes Jr., baseball's chief lawyer. ``One
hopes that we can dispose of the case now.''
   Rose has been accused of betting on his own team, an offense
that could get him banned from baseball for life. But Nadel ruled
that Giamatti had already made up his mind against Rose and could
not give him a fair disciplinary hearing.
   Holschuh's decision takes the case away from Nadel. Holschuh
also extended until at least Aug. 14 Rose's protection against
firing or suspension over the gambling allegations.
   The judge scheduled a hearing for that day on whether to extend
the proection indefinitely.
   Rose's lawyers were expected to appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
   Baseball's lawyers accused Rose of trying to have the case
decided in the court that is ``most subject to the influence of
local pressures produced by his fame, notoriety and close
identification with the city of Cincinnati.''

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems claimed today
they executed Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, and another group
threatened to kill another American hostage if Israel does not free
a Moslem cleric within 24 hours.
   A statement signed by the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth
said the 44-year-old Higgins was hanged at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT), the
deadline they set for Israel to free Sheik Abul-Karim Obeid, who
was captured in south Lebanon Friday.
   Both the tape and statement, typewritten in Arabic, were
delivered to a Western news agency an hour after the deadline.
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was serving as head of an observer
group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when
he was seized Feb. 17, 1988. His captors accused him of spying for
the CIA.
   The new threat came in a handwritten statement from the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, saying its resolved to execute
Joseph James Cicippio unless Israel freed Sheik Abul-Karim Obeid by
6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.
   The statement was delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar along with an snapshot showing a smiling Cicippio wearing
a brown and pink wool sweater over a blue pullover.
   Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   The videotape showed a man the captors identified as Higgins
dangling from a makeshift gallows with both his hands and feet tied
by rope. Taken in two 15-second sequences, the victim wore a white
blindfold in one and was shown without a blindfold in another, with
his head tilted.
   There was no way to immediately verify today's claims by the
Moslem group that held Higgins, and whether the purported hanging
occurred today.
   State Department officials in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, described as credible news reports that the victim in
the videotape was Higgins. They were unable to say, however,
whether the taping was done this morning or earlier.
   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press the United Nations
received unconfirmed reports that Higgins was shot to death after
the shooting down of the Iranian airbus by the U.S.S. Vincennes on
July 3, 1988. At the time, no specific date for the death was given.
   In Chicago, President Bush said he has no independent
confirmation that Higgins has been hanged and said he was cutting
short his trip to return to Washington to try to find out what
happened to Higgins.
   ``I know I speak for all here when I try to express to the
American people the sense of outrage that we all feel about this
kind of brutality, this uncalled-for terrorism,'' he said.
   A Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said the Defense Department has no independent confirmation that
Higgins has been executed.
   A sister of Higgins said she was in a state of shock after the
announcement today.
   ``Yes, I've just spoken with the State Department and I will not
reveal what they said,'' Mary Fischer said at her home in the
Louisville, Ky., suburb of Okolona. ``Right now, I'm in a state of
shock. I just don't know.''
   The 30-second videotape was of extremely bad quality and there
was no indication when it was filmed.
   The tape released in Beirut apparently was taken in two
sequences of 15 seconds each.
   In one sequence, the man purported to be Higgins appeared
dangling from a scaffold and tied to a ceiling with his head tilted
to the left and the body swirling slowly. He was wearing a white
blindfold.
   The second sequence showed him without a blindfold, his eyes
bulging. He was barefoot and wearing a dark jacket and light
trousers.
   In Israel, officials repeated their offer to trade all the
Shiites they hold from south Lebanon for three Israeli servicemen
and all foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Monday Israel was awaiting clear evidence that Higgins was killed
before making official statements.
   But he said the exchange offer stood.
   The offer was made in Jerusalem earlier today by Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in an announcement broadcast on state-run
Israel radio.
   Shiite groups in Lebanon are believed to hold three Israeli
soldiers and 17 foreigners, including nine Americans. Israeli
security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems from Lebanon are
held in Israeli prisons.
   In Tehran earlier today, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati condemned both the death threat and the kidnapping of
Obeid.
   Lebanese security sources and Israeli officials say Obeid played
a role in the kidnapping of Higgins last year, but Obeid denies it.
   Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal
militia called a general strike in Lebanon today to protest Obeid's
abduction.
   Businesses were closed throughout Moslem west Beirut and its
Shiite-populated southern slums, as well as the cities of Sidon,
Tyre, Nabatieh and Baalbek in south and east Lebanon.
   Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres defended the decision
to abduct Obeid, whom Israeli officials have accused of instigating
attacks on Israel. He would not say what Israel's response to the
death threat would be. ``I am not willing to relate either to
details or to threats,'' Peres said.
   The group holding Higgins said in a Dec. 12 statement that it
had sentenced the Marine to death and said he ``made full
confessions about his espionage activities.''
   On Sunday, a statement by the group said: ``we shall carry out
by hanging the death sentence handed down against proven spy
Higgins at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday if Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid and his two brethren have not been freed by then.''
   Israeli commandos stole into the southern Lebanese village of
Jibchit early Friday, kidnapped Obeid from his apartment and flew
him to Israel in a helicopter.
   His cousin, Ahmed Obeid, and a friend, Majid Fahs, also were
seized, Lebanese police said.
   Israel described Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs as ``assistants'' of
Obeid.
   Israeli sources say Obeid was involved in the operation to
kidnap Higgins and held the Marine for a time in his home.
   On Sunday, a leading Iranian official defended the threat
against Higgins.
   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militant
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests
of Israel and the United States,'' Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conference in Tehran. ``They will not
allow them to live comfortably.''
   He named pro-Iranian Hezbollah as one of the Moslem groups that
should retaliate.
   Asked about the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Mohtashemi said:
``The issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us.''
   An Iranian newspaper said Obeid's abduction jeopardized moves to
free the hostages. The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   ``The Zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian
efforts to release hostages in Lebanon,'' the Tehran Times said in
an editorial Sunday.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
Oppressed on Earth today telephoned the office of The Associated
Press and said that unless Obeid is released, the organization
would kill a British hostage, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, on
Tuesday at the same hour they said they killed Higgins.
   The caller, speaking in Lebanese Arabic and English, said the
body of Higgins was dumped behind St. Joseph hospital in west
Beirut, that Syrians picked up Higgins' corpse at 4 p.m., ``and we
are no longer responsible for the body.''
   It could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the
organization, which had not made previous calls to the Cyprus
office of The AP.
   No body was found at the hospital and police said they could not
confirm the killing. The Syrian military command, whose troops
patrol Moslem areas of Lebanon, would not comment.

   A barrage of rockets hit a hospital, a
crowded bus stop and an auto repair shop today in the capital,
killing 21 people and injuring at least 22, the government and
hospital sources said.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla radio official said one
guerrilla faction attacked a rival guerrilla group and killed 59
people, mostly women and children. No date was given for the
attack, which the purported attackers denied.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, U.S. and Soviet delegations began two days
of talks on Afghanistan. It was the first superpower meeting on the
10-year Afghan war since the last Soviet troops, who were allied
with the Kabul government, left the country Feb. 15.
   U.S.-backed guerrillas are fighting to overthrow the
Soviet-backed Marxist government.
   Some homes were also hit today in the shower of 14 rockets,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said.
   Amani said nine people were killed and 22 injured in separate
attacks at Avicenna Hospital, its auto workshop and a nearby bus
stop. But hospital officials put the total killed in those three
attacks at 17 and said four other people died elsewhere.
   The casualties raised to at least 200 the number of people
killed in rocket attacks on the capital this month.
   Amani on Saturday accused the guerrillas of increasing rocket
attacks on Kabul to ``have something in their hand'' for the start
of U.S.-Soviet talks on Afghanistan in Stockholm today.
   Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan this year under a
U.N.-sponsored accord after a nine-year intervention to prop up the
pro-Soviet regime.
   In Islamabad, Qaribur Rehman Saeed, who runs the
rebel-controlled Afghan News Agency, said the Jamiat-e-Islami
guerrilla group attacked the village of Qochi Quba in the northern
Afghan province of Kunduz. He said they killed four rival field
commanders as well as 55 women and children.
   ``They surrounded the village and just began shooting with heavy
artillery and missiles,'' he said. He gave no date for the attack,
which could not be independently confirmed.
   He said the slain field commanders were from the rival
Hezb-e-Islami faction.
   However, Mohammad Shaoib, a spokesman for Jamiat in the
Pakistani city of Peshawar, said, ``We think this is baseless. ...
We haven't heard anything.''
   Amani also said today that government troops ambushed an enemy
ammunition convoy southeast of Jalalabad, killing 75 guerrillas and
injuring 112. He gave no date for the attack.
   In Stockholm, the U.S delegation was led by Assistant Secretary
of State John Kelly. The Soviet delegation was headed by Ambassador
Nicolai Kozyrev.
   An American official in Washington said the Soviet arms supply
to the ruling communists in Kabul will dominate discussions.
   Officials in Stockholm said no issues other than Afghanistan
were on the agenda. However, Jim Borup, a U.S. Embassy spokesman,
did not rule out the possibility that other issues might come up.
   An American official in Washington said Friday the United States
would ask the Soviets for help in trying to win the release of
Americans held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   In Islamabad, the Afghan rebels' government-in-exile said
Washington should not make any agreements at the Stockholm talks.
   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the government-in-exile, said in
a statement to the Afghan News Agency, ``Neither of the two
superpowers can dictate their policies to us.''

<HEAD>Former Prisoners to Resettle in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has agreed to the resettlement in the
United States of at least 19,000 former prisoners who had been
closely associated with the U.S.-backed government in Saigon, State
Department officials said Monday.
   The agreement could mean that more than 100,000 Vietnamese _
prisoners and family members combined _ will emigrate to the United
States, the officials said. The two countries expressed hope that
the first group of 3,000 will have departed Vietnam before the end
of the year.
   The U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said there
are between 19,000 and 27,000 Vietnamese known to have been sent to
re-education camps after the communist conquest of South Vietnam in
1975. All were identified with the former Saigon government, and
officials said there may be others on whom the United States does
not have records.
   For each former prisoner, there are four to five family members
who would be eligible to emigrate with them to the United States,
said the officials.
   A joint statement released by the State Department said the
United States promised not to encourage released detainees to
engage in activities hostile to Vietnam.
   Vietnam, in turn, pledged that no such detainees will be
encouraged to carry out anti-U.S. activities once they are
resettled in the United States.
   The two countries worked out the agreement during three days of
talks that ended Saturday.
   A year ago, an agreement on resettlement of the former detainees
and their families appeared to be near but Vietnam suspended talks
after unfriendly remarks by a former top Reagan administration
official.
   Also Monday, Vietnam gave a U.S. military team what may be the
remains of 15 American soldiers killed in the Vietnam War, an
official Vietnamese radio broadcast said.
   A representative of Vietnam's Office For Seeking Missing
Personnel gave the remains to the team from the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, the Voice of Vietnam reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said it was the 25th
repatriation since March 1974, and 391 sets of remains have been
returned in all.
   In the past, remains have been returned in a U.S. military
ceremony at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport and then flown to an Army
laboratory in Hawaii for analysis.
   Vietnam returned what it believed to be the remains of 28
Americans on June 21. It has stepped up repatriations since an
August 1987 agreement in which the United States pledged to help
Vietnam seek humanitarian aid.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Jim Williams, said
U.S. experts were also beginning their seventh joint search to
account for missing Americans. Their effort is to last 15 to 20
days.

<HEAD>House Approves Bill Allowing Students to Forestall Return to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a new reaction to China's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in June, the House on Monday approved a
measure that would allow thousands of Chinese students in the
United States to forestall their return to their homeland.
   The measure, adopted by voice vote, was sent to the Senate for
further action.
   The legislation would affect 32,000 of the 40,000 Chinese
students in the United States, those who hold ``exchange visitor''
visas. Those visas require students to return to China for at least
two years following their time in the United States before being
able to return or go elsewhere.
   They are intended primarily for promising students whose
educations are funded by the government, in an effort to address
the ``brain drain'' problem.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would waive
the requirement that they return home for two years.
   Passage of the measure followed the addition by the House of
several sanctions against China to a foreign aid bill a month ago.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House Judiciary
immigration subcommittee, acknowledged that the legislation carries
with it a risk that the Chinese government will curtail student
exchanges.
   ``But the people who govern China need to understand the
principles of liberty and democracy in action,'' he said. ``All we
are doing is saying that if the People's Republic of China wishes
these students to come home it must do so by bringing them back by
its own behavior. It must be a voluntary return, not one forced by
the laws of the United States.''

   President Bush said today he has no final
confirmation that Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins was hanged by his
Middle Eastern captors, but he cut short a two-day Western trip to
deal with a ``matter that has shocked the American people right to
the core.''
   Bush said in Chicago that he would first try to learn what had
happened to Higgins, and then ``figure out what might conceivably
be done'' in response.
   He ordered a late-afternoon meeting of his national security
advisers.
   Meanwhile, death threats were made against another American
hostage and a British hostage.
   Arriving at the White House, Bush told reporters, ``I don't have
what I would call a final confirmation'' that Higgins had been
killed. He said he had talked to the U.N. secretary general and to
Higgins' wife Robin, whom he described as a ``stoic individual who
is going through sheer hell.''
   ``At this juncture we want to get all the information and be
sure we're dealing with facts ... but it is a most troubling and
disturbing matter that has shocked the American people right to the
core,'' the president said.
   ``There is no way I can properly express the outrage that I
feel,'' he said. ``And somehow there has got to be a return to
decency and honor even in matters of this nature.''
   Higgins, 44, was serving as part of an international
peacekeeping force in Lebanon when he was taken captive in February
1988. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said today they hanged him
in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric. The
group released a videotape purporting to show the execution.
   A group called the Revolutionary Justice Organization said in a
statement delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar
that it would execute another American hostage, Joseph James
Cicippio, unless Israel freed Obeid by 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.
   Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
Oppressed on Earth said in a phone call to The Associated Press
that unless Obeid is released, the organization would kill a
British hostage, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite. The caller said
Waite would be killed Tuesday at the same hour Higgins was killed.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, returning home from a
conference in Paris, called the reported killing ``outrageous and
uncivilized behavior,'' but he added: ``I do have to say that these
reports are as yet unconfirmed and I am not in a position to
confirm the accuracy of the report.''
   State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, described as
credible news reports that the victim in the videotape was indeed
Higgins. They were unable to say, however, whether the taping was
done this morning or earlier.
   A senior administration official, speaking to reporters aboard
the plane carrying Baker back to Washington, said the United States
is not holding Israel responsible for the reported execution of
Higgins.
   The official, who demanded that reporters not identify him,
said, ``Violence and kidnaping are not the route to peace'' in the
Middle East.
   Asked if the statements Bush and Baker had made deploring
kidnaping were intended as criticism of Israel, the official said,
``I am not criticizing Israel for what it did. That's not the
interpretation.''
   Israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric, Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, and that country's Shiite Moslem captives in
exchange for all captured Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages
held by Shiite groups in Lebanon.
   Bush had no comment on the Israeli proposal, although he said
last week, ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause
of peace.''
   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said in Washington,
``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis
one of these days would be refreshing.''
   A somber president made his comments in the opening moments of a
speech to the National Governors' Association meeting in Chicago,
the first stop of what had been planned as a three-state trip.
   ``Whether this report is true or not, I know I speak for all
here when I try to express to the American people the sense of
outrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality, this
uncalled-for terrorism,'' Bush said.
   ``This was a young American colonel serving in international
force and it is incumbent upon all of us to try and rectify this
situation if at all possible,'' he said.
   Bush offered no details of his plans as he stopped briefly to
answer reporters' questions.
   ``This is a matter of grave concern to the American people,'' he
said. ``Discussing is not the way to conduct the foreign policy or
national security policy of this country. We're not going to handle
it that way.''
   Bush canceled visits to Las Vegas and Oklahoma City today and
Tuesday to return to Washington. He said he would ``convene our top
national security people, and confirm to the best of our ability if
this report is true, and then consider what might be done.''
   There are nine Americans in captivity in the Middle East,
including Terry Anderson, Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
said Cheney is ``following the same reports we are all following.''
   Cheney met with Higgins' wife, Robin, on Saturday, and both
appeared during the day at the annual convention of a group formed
to support the families of prisoners of war and those missing in
action in Southeast Asia.
   In his brief comments, Bush made no comment about the proposed
swap advanced by Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Before Bush made his comments, Dole said that if the reports of
Higgins' killing were true, he hoped the administration woulid have
``an appropriate response. I'm not certain when an appropriate
response would be, but I'm certain there should be a response,'' he
said.
   Dole also said that if the reports of Higgins' death were true,
``the I would hope the Israelis would take another look at some of
their actions that they must know in advance would endanger
American lives.''
   Dole said he hoped Bush could ``have some understanding with the
Israelis about future conduct which, I've indicated, endangers the
lives of Americans.''

   The nation's governors on Monday welcomed
President Bush's call to meet with him this fall on education, even
as they pressed concerns about spending on transportation and
Medicaid.
   Bush formally announced plans for a summit on education with the
governors in late September during an appearance before the annual
meeting of the National Governors' Association. The meeting on
education was one of several the governors had asked for in a
private meeting with the president in May.
   ``We're impressed with the accessiblity and indications of a
cooperative attitude'' from Bush, said Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, a Democrat and chairman of the governors association.
   Democrat Bill Clinton of Arkansas said the summit will keep
education and child-related issues on the public agenda.
   But Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat who has indicated
presidential ambitions, said Bush's remarks were too little
considering Bush's campaign claim to be ``the education president.''
   ``I thought it was a rather uninspired and uninspiring
presentation of the president's priorities, with which no one is
going to disagree,'' Celeste said in an interview. ``It lacked any
real vision or any real voltage in terms of getting us moving now.''
   Celeste said one issue in the education meeting would be what he
said was a dampening effect on state and local education
initiatives created by the budget climate and Bush's flat
opposition to new taxes.
   ``The president's posture last year in the election really
chilled efforts at education reform and education finance in many
parts of this country,'' Celeste said. ``The president is in a
unique position to sound the trumpet _ and I didn't hear any brass
this morning.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee who lost to Bush last year, shook hands with Bush and spoke
briefly. But to reporters, Dukakis complained about ``Washington's
inability to deal with this deficit'' and pointed to his own tax
increases and budget cuts in Massachusetts.
   ``I had to cut and cut deeply,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Governors will tell you we'll do everything we can to try to
help Congress and the administraion deal with it _ but we've been
doing that since 1983,'' Dukakis said.
   Governors of both parties met in private over breakfast before
Bush's address, and several governors said later that the major
concern voiced in the meeting was federal Medicaid requirements
that force states to spend more on health care, without
compensation from the federal government. Those so-called mandates
include requirements for additional types of coverage.
   In a question-and-answer session with Bush, Celeste asked the
president to consider a two-year moratorium on additional Medicaid
mandates, which he later described as the fastest growing spending
item in his state budget.
   Bush did not commit himself to such a moratorium but said: ``I'd
like to consider it, and certainly we're trying to hold the line on
spiraling costs.''
   Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who later
addressed the governors, both suggested they were sympathetic with
the governors on the issue of surplus federal transportation trust
funds, another major concern the governors voiced during the
meeting.
   The trust funds for highways and airport facilities contain as
much as $19 billion, according to governors, who contend much of
that is not obligated to specific projects and is being withheld
from the states so it can count against the deficit in the federal
budget.
   ``I know the frustration around this table,'' Bush said, ``when
you see this tremendous highway trust fund and wonder why those
funds aren't immediately available for the purposes for which they
are earmarked. The answer obviously is budgetary.''
   Baliles said he pressed the point with Skinner in private.
Skinner drew applause later when he voiced sympathy and suggested
that Congress was to blame _ without promising any money.
   Baliles said later that the issue was ``being discussed at
different levels.'' But Celeste complained, ``It seems to me we
have a long way to go to get to the point where we have the money
we need.''

   Police say the stolen evidence was
within sight _ on the X-ray of the suspect's stomach _ and the only
question was how to recover the two diamond rings.
   So R.C. Wright, 29, of Pittsburgh, decided to ``regurgitate the
rings'' Sunday night, said Officer Robert Tuite. ``It was voluntary
on his part.''
   Police who responded to a report of a break-in at a house
ordered the intruder to surrender, and he eventually did,
authorities said.
   The homeowner said a .32-caliber revolver and two rings _ a
half-carat diamond ring worth about $600 and a smaller diamond ring
worth about $300 _ were missing, police said. They found the
pistol, but concluded their suspect must have swallowed the rings,
authorities said.
   Police got a search warrant and took Wright to a hospital, where
X-rays showed the rings clearly, police said.
   Police said doctors said the rings could be recovered through
stomach pumping or surgery or by waiting for him to pass them.
   ``As it turned out, he knew that things weren't going to be all
that comfortable for him anyway, so he decided to cough them up,''
said Sgt. Dan Rearick. ``He just said, `Wait a minute.' Then he
coughed up the rings.''
   Rearick said the suspect handed the rings to police.
   Wright was arraigned Sunday night on charges of burglary,
criminal attempt, possession of an instrument of crime, recklessly
endangering another person and a firearms violation.
   He was being held in the Allegheny County Jail on $25,000 bail,
authorities said.

<BYLINE>U.S. Re-Establishes High-Level Contact With Beijing ^By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States re-established
high-level contact with China Monday nearly two months after troops
forcibly put down a pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square
and found considerable agreement on Cambodia's future.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who requested the
meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris,
stressed that Americans were unhappy with China's actions which
threatened the country with diplomatic isolation if continued, a
senior U.S. official said.
   The one-hour and 35-minute meeting was held in a side room of a
conference hall in which 19 nations, including the United States
and China, are seeking to end civil war in Cambodia and guide the
Southeast Asian nation toward rehabilitation after decades of wars
and a Vietnamese invasion.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, told reporters as Baker
flew home from Paris that Baker and Qian had agreed that the Khmer
Rouge, accused of murdering more than 1 million Cambodians in a
four-year reign of terror in the 1970s, should not have a dominant
role in any Cambodian government.
   But, the official said, the Chinese, who backed the Khmer Rouge,
sought more of a role than the United States would like the group
to have as Prince Norodom Sihanouk attempts to form a transitional
government.
   After Chinese troops fired on demonstrators June 3-4, President
Bush imposed a series of sanctions which were criticized by many in
Congress as too mild. They included a ban on high-level exchanges
between U.S. and Chinese officials and visits to Beijing by senior
U.S. government officials.
   Baker, taking the view that the sanctions did not keep him from
meeting with Qian outside China, requested the meeting in which the
major topic was Cambodia's future.
   On that subject, the official said, they found considerable
agreement, especially that Vietnam should release its hold on the
country. A government installed by Hanoi is in power in Pnom Penh,
but Vietnamese troops are scheduled to depart by the end of
September.
   Asked if Qian had been swayed by Baker's argument against a
powerful role for the Khmer Rouge, the official said ``we simply
had a frank and candid'' exchange on the issue. He called it ``the
one significant difference'' between Washington and Beijing.
   On China's own internal policies, the official said, Baker
``made the point that repression would not be understood by the
American people.''
   The official said that if China intends to continue on the path
of reform ``it should not isolate itself with conduct that would
not be understood.''
   Baker stressed that the United States wants to maintain strong
ties with China but Bush ``can't do it alone. He's going to need
some help in terms of the future course of actions'' in Beijing.

   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak for
Oppressed on Earth telephoned the office of The Associated Press
and said the organization would kill a British hostage, Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite, at the same time Tuesday unless Obeid was
released.
   The caller, speaking in Lebanese Arabic and English, said the
body of Higgins was dumped behind St. Joseph hospital in west
Beirut, that Syrians picked up Higgins' corpse at 4 p.m., ``and we
are no longer responsible for the body.''
   It could not be immediately verified if the caller was from the
organization, which had not made previous calls to the Cyprus
office of The AP.
   No body was found at the hospital and police said they could not
confirm the killing. The Syrian military command, whose troops
patrol Moslem areas of Lebanon, would not comment.
   A police spokesman said: ``It seems highly unlikely that the
captors were able to hang the man, take the film and distribute it
inside an hour.''
   In Israel, officials repeated their offer to trade all Shiites
they hold from south Lebanon for three Israeli soldiers and the
Western hostages.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Perez de Cuellar's spokesman,
Juan-Carlos Brandt, said if Higgins had been killed, ``the
secretary-general can only express his outrage and revulsion at the
fact that an innocent man serving the United Nations in the cause
of peace should be murdered in this fashion.''
   In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had said earlier
the threat to Higgins ``has nothing to do with us,'' but added that
Israel should be pressed to release Obeid. ``We condemn any kind of
kidnapping or death threat,'' he said.
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attached
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was
abducted near Tyre.
   Previous statements from his captors claimed he used the U.N.
post as a cover for spying on Moslem guerrillas.
   In their last statement, on Dec. 12, 1988, they said Higgins had
been sentenced to death after making ``full confessions about his
espionage activities.''
   Sources in the U.N. force have said they believe Higgins was
dead when that statement was issued. They said they had information
he died of maltreatment after an attempt to escape.
   Previous statements from the captors were accompanied by
photographs of the decorated Vietnam veteran or of his military
identification card.
   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press the United Nations
got unconfirmed reports that Higgins was killed after the USS
Vincennes, on duty in the Persian Gulf, shot down an Iranian
jetliner on July 3, 1988.
   The death of another hostage, 67-year-old journalist Alec
Collett, was announced under similar circumstances in April 1986.
Collett was kidnapped March 25, 1985, while on assignment in
Lebanon for a U.N. agency.
   His captors said he was hanged in retaliation for The April 15,
1986, U.S. air raids on Libya. A videotape of a body suspended from
a gallows could not be verified and no body was found.
   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the release
of foreign hostages after leaving his west Beirut hotel to
negotiate with Islamic Jihad. He is believed held by Islamic Jihad,
though no group has claimed responsibility for his abduction or
made demands for his release.
   Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the Western held longest in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Report: AIDS to Cost $7 Billion in New York City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Yorkers with AIDS and related illnesses will
need $7 billion in health and social services over the next 4{
years, a task force said Monday.
   The New York City AIDS Task Force predicted that by the end of
1993, 4,990 acute-care hospital beds _ one-fifth of the city's
total _ will hold AIDS patients.
   The money is needed to double the number of hospital beds,
nursing home beds and housing units for AIDS patients, as well as
to provide outpatient, long-term and home health care, said Dr.
Stephen C. Joseph, task force chairman and city health commissioner.
   The report also calls for greatly expanded prevention programs,
including AIDS education in all grades. It calls for elimination of
waiting lists for treatment of drug abusers, many of whom are
exposed to AIDS by sharing needles. It urges that people with AIDS
and related illnesses should be treated by community-based
organizations, whenever possible, and says those organizations
should get more money from the private and public sectors.
   The 29-member task force includes government and private medical
experts and representatives of business and AIDS support groups.
Its recommendations aren't binding, but the report will be used as
a lobbying tool and a blueprint for public and non-profit agencies,
Joseph said.
   As of June 30, there were 20,177 AIDS cases reported in New York
City, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, 20 percent of the national total of 99,936 cases.
   By the end of 1993, the report said, the cumulative total in the
city may reach 63,952 AIDS cases and perhaps 50,157 deaths.
   The report says it appears that people with AIDS are surviving
longer, partly due to earlier diagnosis and better treatment.
Studies are urgently needed to predict their needs, it says.
   Special services should be developed for teen-agers, a group
where the disease ``is likely to increase silently but quickly in
the years to come,'' the report warns.
   Leaders of minority groups were urged to heighten awareness of
the disease in their communities. The mentally retarded and
mentally ill also must be taught how to avoid the virus, the report
said.

<HEAD>Cancun Fires: Jungle Burns, But Beaches Unaffected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low, creeping jungle fires fed by debris
from Hurricane Gilbert have charred hundreds of miles of the
Yucatan Peninsula, but the beaches have been spared.
   ``We need two or three days of continual rain to put it out. We
need another hurricane, but a benevolent one,'' said Jose Angel
Loria, the Agriculture Department's top official in Quintana Roo
state.
   Prevailing winds from the sea pushed the fires and smoke away
from the plush resort of Cancun, where they started in March on the
city's western fringes, and from a string of towns dotting the
white-sand coast.
   But by the end of July the fires had burned 370,000 acres of
forest in a 70-mile strip down the Yucatan, feeding on deadfall
from last September's hurricane. Ecologists say the fire has
damaged the thin soil and accuse the government of bumbling and
delay in fighting the blaze.
   ``The Cancun fires are an ecological disaster of great
proportions,'' said Homero Aridjis, a spokesman for the Group of
100 Artists and Intellectuals, one of Mexico's main environmental
organizations.
   Mark Goldston of Syosset, N.Y., saw thin columns of smoke as he
flew into Cancun for a vacation.
   ``There were so many of them we began to wonder if they were
geysers of some sort,'' he said.
   Traveling along the coast to the south, he noticed the smell of
smoke. On that road, and west toward the Mayan ruins of Chichen
Itza, patches of burned jungle run up to the edge of the road.
   But a tourist on the beach at Cancun's hotel strip, across a
large lagoon from the mainland, wouldn't know there was a fire.
Several tourists mentioned seeing smoke from the air, but none said
it interfered with their vacation.
   Jose Ignacio Pedroza Alvarez, administrator of the Cancun office
of the Urban Development and Ecology Department, said loss of
vegetation and dislocation of wildlife is substantial.
   Slow-moving creatures like snakes have been found in the ashes,
but most large mammals and other swift-moving animals are believed
to have escaped, he said. No one has been injured or killed and no
homes have been destroyed.
   ``They have gone to nearby areas, fortunately, jungle areas that
have the same characteristics,'' he said. ``They may adapt to the
place, but two things can happen: the struggle against other
species for food and the competition for space.''
   Gilbert's howling winds left 2.5 million acres of forest a
tinderbox of fallen trees, branches and leaves. There have been
similar fires after previous hurricanes, but they didn't blow down
as much timber.
   The Yucatan forest, on a limestone cap covered by as little as
three inches of soil, is not the classic towering rain forest of
broadleafed trees, tangles of vines and dangling lianas like the
famous Lacondon jungle 400 miles to the southwest. Most of the
Yucatan trees are under 100 feet tall.
   Loria said the six main fires stretch from the northeast corner
of the Yucatan Peninsula 70 miles south past Cancun toward the
snorkeling lagoon of Xel Ha.
   ``What we are sure of is that man caused the fires,'' said
Loria. He said they could have been ignited by the slash and burn
agriculture common in the area, cigarette butts or campfires left
by hunters.
   Critics say bureaucracy interfered with projects to clear fallen
timber and that the government did nothing when the fires started,
confident the rains would come, as usual, in May. But there has
been little rain.
   ``There was little attention from the state government until the
situation reached uncontrollable proportions,'' said Fernando
Gutierrez, who is active in the local Mayab Ecological Group.
   Loria said some work was done but confirmed that officials were,
in fact, waiting for rain. In July, he said, winds fanned the
flames, spreading the fire 2,500 acres a day.
   That was when 2,700 army and navy troops were called in, joining
a maximum of 500 civilians to cut firebreaks and limit the blazes.
   The fire has been fickle, sending out fingers a foot or two high
that turn the litter of leaves to thick ash, burn small trees and
char big trunks until a tree topples, but sparing others.
   From a low-flying plane, blackened earth shows through a
still-green canopy. Some trees that survived may die soon because
their roots burned, Pedroza said.

   Thirty years after he helped launch the
Newport Folk Festival, Pete Seeger returned to lead fans in singing
his familiar repertoire of folk classics and protest songs.
   Some of the 5,500 people who heard the 70-year-old singer at the
close of the two-day festival Sunday remembered his first
appearance there in 1959.
   The music hasn't changed much, said Joe Salviulo, 48, of
Southbridge Mass. But the audience has.
   ``Everybody was a little bit more spaced-out back then,''
Salviulo recalled. ``It was more like Woodstock. This is like a
Sunday in the park in comparison.''

   Irish flautist James Galway offered
a reward Monday for the return of five stolen gold flutes, three of
which are studded with diamonds.
   The musician said he hopes the thief will have trouble selling
the distinctive instruments, which disappeared Wednesday from a
railway station along with luggage he was unloading.
   ``It's like somebody trying to sell a Formula One car,'' Galway
said. ``Of course it can be sold but you have to find somebody who
is not going to drive in the Indianapolis 500, otherwise it would
be spotted immediately.''
   Four of the flutes were 14-carat gold, one was 9-carat gold and
three had diamonds in the end. Galway, who values the instruments
at about $30,000 each, said he would pay a reward of 10 percent for
their return.

   Steve Hall, the voice of the mustachioed
television puppet Shotgun Red, wants $50,000 from his manager and a
toy maker in a dispute over Shotgun Red dolls.
   Hall's demand comes in response to a lawsuit that accused him of
defrauding the manager and manufacturer in deals involving
promotional items based on Shotgun Red.
   Hall is the voice and operator of the puppet, which plays host
to country music shows on The Nashville Network programming carried
by cable TV companies around the country and has appeared on ``Hee
Haw'' and other shows.
   Hall's manager, Richard Davis, and Greg Knox of Creative
Marketing Services of Madison, Tenn., sued Hall in Crow Wing
County, Minn., District Court, seeking $175,000 in the dispute.
   In a counterclaim filed recently, Hall says Davis competed with
him by selling Shotgun Red dolls and other items in violation of
the licensing agreement. He says he and his wife, Daisy, are owed
$175,000 for Shotgun Red dolls and other items.

   School board members aren't sure they want
actor Rob Lowe giving anti-drug lectures in classrooms under a
court-ordered community-service sentence.
   ``We will want a guarantee for the parents of our children that
children are protected,'' said Los Angeles Unified School District
board President Jackie Goldberg. ``It appears on the surface he
has, at minimum, dubious judgment.''
   Lowe, 25, was accused of sexual exploitation of a minor after he
allegedly videotaped sexual encounters with a 16-year-old girl in
an Atlanta hotel room in 1988.
   On Friday, the actor agreed with the Fulton County Court in
Georgia to perform 20 hours of community service, warning high
school students of the dangers of drugs. The agreement _ made under
a special program for young first offenders _ spares the star of
``St. Elmo's Fire'' and other movies of being charged in the case,
and he doesn't admit guilt.
   Fulton County District Attorney Lewis R. Slaton suggested Lowe
speak in high schools in Los Angeles, where he lives, and in Ohio,
his home state.

   Mick Jagger's Rolling Stones changed their
North American tour schedule Monday so the band will begin its
travels with a concert in Philadelphia rather than in Buffalo, N.Y.
   The Stones were originally to appear at Philadelphia's John F.
Kennedy Stadium on Sept. 21 _ well after the opening concert set
for Sept. 1 in Buffalo. But the Philadelphia stop was canceled when
the city closed the stadium for safety reasons.
   Another change was made and the Stones will now open the tour
with a pair of concerts Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 at Philadelphia's
Veterans Stadium, said Joe Owens of Concert Productions
International, the Toronto-based promoter of the tour.
   That forced cancellation of the Buffalo concert, said Owens, who
promised: ``Several special options to accommodate Buffalo fans are
in the works and an announcement is expected shortly.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Commission Will Condemn Nazi-Soviet Pact Annexing Baltics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional commission will soon condemn the
secretly signed Nazi-Soviet pact that gave the three Baltic
republics to the Soviet Union, a legislator said Monday.
   The Kremlin has denied existence of the secret section of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact for 50 years, although it long has been
accepted in the West.
   The 26-member panel of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
is expected to vote this week on a report acknowledging existence
of the agreement, said one of its members, Estonian legislator Igor
N. Gryazin.
   He said in an interview the commission will publish the
agreement and declare it null and void.
   The agreement is at the heart of a drive by people in Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia for more control over their own affairs, if
not outright independence.
   Soviet history books long have claimed that Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia voluntarily joined the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics at the beginning of World War II. Baltic activists say
the secret protocol is evidence they were forced to do so.
   Gryazin said the final report does not take an even more radical
step demanded by many Baltic activists, that of saying that the
protocol paved the way for the 1940 Soviet takeover, Gryazin said.
   Instead, it says ``Stalinist methods of foreign policy became
possible due to this protocol,'' according to the legislator.
   Still, Gryazin said, ``We've done a good job, if you think that
from a period of total denial to acceptance has been just three
weeks'' of commission meetings.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported the creation of the
parliamentary commission in June but implied Western copies of the
secret protocol might be forgeries. However, the Kremlin clearly
supports the findings because the commission is chaired by
Gorbachev ally and ruling Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev
and includes Valentin M. Falin, head of the international
department of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Hundreds of Baltic dissidents have been jailed over the years
for protesting the pact named for the men who signed it: the Soviet
foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, and his German counterpart,
Joachim von Ribbentrop.
   But under Gorbachev's more tolerant approach toward dissent,
thousands of Baltic residents have demonstrated regularly against
the pact, which new, more liberal Estonian and Lithuanian
governments in May asked the Kremlin to renounce. Unofficial
political groups in Latvia have made similar calls.
   Major demonstrations are scheduled in the three republics on
Aug. 23, the 50th anniversary of the pact.
   Newspapers in all three republics published the pact a year ago
and it appeared in June in a small-circulation monthly, Questions
of History.
   Gryazin said the Commission on the Political and Legal
Evaluation of the 1939 Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact expects to
publish its report this week with an authenticated version of the
pact in the mass-circulation national press for the first time,
before the full Congress votes on it.
   The draft report calls on the 2,250-member Congress, scheduled
to meet in October, to declare the pact ``legally null and void''
and ``an aberration from ... Leninist principles, which
contradicted the sovereignty and independence of a number of third
states.'' The third states are Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which
were independent between the two world wars, and Poland.
   Baltic parliaments decided to join the Soviet Union in 1940, but
activists and many historians say this was done under pressure. The
United States and several other Western nations describe the
Baltics as ``enslaved nations'' and never have recognized their
incorporation into the Soviet Union.
   Gryazin said it is important to realize that ``if we want to be
in the Soviet Union, we want to have some guarantee that the Soviet
Union denies such (forceful) methods and accepts democratic forms
of federation.''
   He predicted Baltic residents will see the report as ``approval
of an elementary fact'' and other, skeptical Soviets will become
convinced, though ``It will be a shock for them.''
   Gryazin, a law professor, said the parliamentary commission
obtained 55 pounds of documents and a copy of the protocol from the
U.S. Library of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Fourteen rockets struck Kabul Monday,
killing 21 people and wounding 58 at a U.S.-built hospital, a bus
stop, an auto repair shop and several homes, hospital officials
reported.
   In Stockholm, U.S. and Soviet officials began talks on the
Afghan civil war between Washington-backed anti-communist
guerrillas and Afghanistan's Marxist government supported by Moscow.
   Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said nine
people were killed and 22 injured by rockets that hit the Avicenna
Chest Hospital, the hospital's auto shop and a nearby bus stop. But
hospital officials put the total killed in those three attacks at
17 and said four people were killed in other attacks.
   Rocket explosions could be heard in Kabul throughout the day and
Amani said some of the missiles fell in the diplomatic quarter and
on houses in the old city and western Kabul.
   ``Again today misery-stricken Kabul city is victim of severe
rocket attacks by the brutal extremists,'' Amani said.
   No group cliamed responsibility for the latest attacks but
guerrillas have acknowledged previous attacks on the capital.
   Amani on Saturday claimed the guerrillas, who call themselves
mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors, were increasing rocket attacks
on Kabul to ``have something in their hand'' when the U.S.-Soviet
talks started in Stockholm.
   United Nations sources said that from June 25 to July 30,
rockets killed 257 people and injured 687 in Kabul.
   Amani said an average of 15 rockets were being fired daily into
the capital, most by remote control or timers, from mountains,
villages and wooded areas where they are difficult to detect. He
said some rockets had been found in search operations in northern
Kabul.
   The summer school vacation, which lasts about two weeks and was
scheduled to end July 29, has been extended for two weeks because
of the rocketing, Amani said.
   He said that in recent weeks rockets hit seven schools and if
classes had been in session ``the number of victims would have been
much higher.''
   Elsewhere, Amani said government troops ambushed an enemy
ammunition convoy southeast of Jalalabad, killing 75 guerrillas and
wounding 112. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized
and destroyed, he said.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Both sides in
the war have been known to inflate casualty figures.
   Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul and 45 miles west of the
Pakistani border, has been the scene of fierce fighting since the
withdrawal of the last of 110,000 Soviet troops on Feb. 15. The
guerrillas have been repulsed twice in their attempts to take the
city.

<HEAD>Doctor Vows Appeal in Patient Dumping Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICTORIA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first doctor to be penalized for
violating a 1986 federal law prohibiting ``patient dumping'' said
Monday he fears the ruling may limit patients' access to improved
technology.
   Michael Burditt of Victoria said he will appeal the $20,000
civil penalty imposed on him by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Administrative Law Judge Charles E. Stratton ruled that Burditt
let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his judgment when he
ordered a poor, sick woman who was about to give birth transferred
to another hospital 160 miles away.
   ``I feel this ruling is very dangerous, not only to every
physician, but to every patient, also,'' Burditt said.
   ``We're going to be fearful of transferring patients in the
future,'' Burditt said at a news conference. ``It will severely
limit any patient's access to needed technology, or physicians who
are accustomed to using that technology.''
   ``I would be scared to death if I was practicing in a rural
setting,'' he said. ``I would be concerned I'd get over my head and
lose a patient for lack of being able to transfer the patient to
needed technology or a better-trained physician.''
   Burditt was chief of the obstetrical department at the private
DeTar Hospital when Rosa Rivera showed up at the emergency room on
Dec. 5, 1986, with a dangerously high blood pressure of 210 over
160.
   Burditt told nurses by phone the patient ``sounds like more than
I can handle,'' and ``he did not want to take care of this lady.''
   Burditt drove to the hospital, examined her and ordered her
transferred to a better-equipped hospital in Galveston despite the
objections of nurses who feared it would violate the then-new law
against patient dumping. The law specifies that hospitals must
treat patients in medical emergencies or in active labor.
   Burditt said he would choose his patients until DeTar paid his
malpractice premiums. But he also stayed to deliver a baby of
another poor, uninsured women who was seven months' pregnant and
bleeding.
   Mrs. Rivera bore a healthy 6-pound baby boy in the ambulance
parked on the roadside 40 miles east of Victoria. She and the baby
were returned to DeTar, where another doctor treated them.
   DeTar, which nearly lost its eligibility for Medicare funding,
paid a $5,000 fine after an investigation by the Dallas regional
office of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Burditt's attorney, Edward Ganem, said they will try an
administrative appeal, but also will seek help in a federal court
if necessary. He said Stratton's opinion gave scant consideration
to testimony by Burditt and other witnesses at a five-day hearing.

<HEAD>Palestinian Who Met Shamir Threatened by Radicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall slogans have appeared in the occupied West
Bank, threatening a Palestinian lawyer who held talks with Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel.
   The lawyer said he also has been threatened by someone he
believes to be an Israeli extremist.
   In the Israeli-occupied lands, two Palestinian youths were shot
to death Monday in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops. In
Jerusalem, a Palestinian laborer stabbed and wounded his foreman, a
Jewish settler.
   The Palestinian attorney, Jamil Tarifi, of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, said last week he recently met with Shamir. The prime
minister has held a series of meetings with Palestinians from the
occupied territories, but Tarifi is the only one who has
acknowledged attending the sessions.
   Israel is trying to find Palestinians with no links to the
Palestine Liberation Organization who will cooperate with its plan
to hold elections on limited autonomy for the occupied territories.
   Late last year, Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij was threatened by
PLO officials, including group leader Yasser Arafat, forcing him to
back off from his call for a one-year suspension of the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands.
   Slogans painted in black on walls in the West Bank town of
Ramallah condemned the meeting between Shamir and Tarifi.
   ``A meeting with Shamir is a bullet shot in the back of the
intefadeh,'' or Palestinian uprising, one said. ``Shame on Jamil
Tarifi and all those who meet the murderers of our people,''
another read.
   Tarifi, 42, said one wall message was signed by the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO
led by George Habash.
   The group wants to escalate the 19-month Palestinian rebellion
in the occupied lands and rejects what it views as compromise
offers to Israel from PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who leads the
PLO's mainstream Fatah wing.
   ``There are political differences between the mainstream in the
PLO and the PFLP,'' Tarifi said. But he said he was not sure the
threats actually came from the Marxist faction.
   ``It is sufficient for me that Yasser Arafat and (Fatah's No. 2
man) Salah Khalaf and the great majority of Palestinians backed my
meeting with Shamir,'' he said.
   Shamir said Monday that any threat ``is regrettable.'' He added
that Palestinian extremists were ``trying to prevent Palestinians
from speaking openly.''
   Tarifi said he also was threatened by an anonymous phone caller
whom he described as an Israeli extremist.
   ``An Israeli speaking Hebrew mixed with broken Arabic told me
yesterday and the day before that my life is at risk,'' he said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 15-year-old Mahmoud Yasin Saraj was
fatally shot in the neck by Israeli soldiers during a confrontation
with Israeli soldiers in the Bureij refugee camp, Arab reporters
said.
   In the Balata refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, police on
patrol opened fire when they were stoned, killing 12-year-old
Sultan Mohammed Abu Musallem, Palestinian journalists said.
   The army confirmed both deaths and said paramilitary border
police opened fire on Abu Musallem after he threw a cinderblock at
a policeman.
   The deaths raised to 527 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops and settlers since the Palestinian uprising began.
Thirty-eight Israelis have also died.
   Hospital officials also said Monday that at least 15
Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds over the previous 24 hours in
clashes around the occupied territories.
   In Jerusalem, a 28-year-old Palestinian laborer from the West
Bank village of Bir Zeit was accused of stabbing his Jewish foreman
and then fleeing, police said.
   The foreman, Eliezer Sobol, was treated at Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital for wounds that included chest cuts and a ripped muscle.
Police said they detained Mohammed Awad Shartah in Ramallah on
suspicion of stabbing Sobol, 39.
   ``It was a worker who has been with me since 1982-83. He came
into my office and said, `I can't come to work tomorrow.' When I
asked him why, he took out a knife and stabbed me,'' Sobol told
Israel radio.

   Milan's daily Corriere della Sera reported Monday that Dati was

   Checking his papers, police found that Dati, 29, was employed as
an operator at a hospital in nearby Torre Annunziata.
   The newspaper reported that Dati had been awarded the job in
January 1988 after submitting a medical document that said he had

   The daily reported that hospital officials suspended Dati from
his job, pending an investigation.

   The scene was bleak at Food Store No. 68
at 12:30 p.m. Monday.
   There was no bread, little milk, no flour, no cheese. The meager
daily deliveries had been sold out.
   ``Maybe there's a war coming,'' said one shopper after walking
in, looking at the bare shelves, and walking out.
   ``I haven't had any breakfast because I couldn't get any
bread,'' complained an office worker.
   ``We will have some bread later,'' the shop attendant in the
state-owned store said. He had no answer when he was asked when.
   ``And I'll end up eating my breakfast together with supper,''
said a woman who left.
   There were a few things left to buy in the store: Ketchup and
bottled beets, fruit preserves, yogurt, four jars of a sour milk
beverage called kefir, hard candy, cocoa and a few packages of
pretzel sticks.
   One woman said it was fortunate her family was on vacation in
the countryside, where supplies were a little more abundant. All
she had found to put in her shopping basket Monday was kefir and a
head of cauliflower.
   ``I'll be on a diet,'' she said.
   Food shortages have become more widespread in Poland in recent
months. Monday, many more shoppers than usual came out to buy goods
before price controls are lifted Tuesday and prices soar under a
controversial government program.
   Meat rationing is also being abolished, meaning families will no
longer have the right to buy 5.5 pounds of meat per person monthly
at relatively low, government-subsidized prices. Consumers have had
to stand several hours in line waiting for meat deliveries.
   The government has blamed the shortages on decisions by Poland's
mainly private farmers to cut meat and grain deliveries to the
state this summer. The farmers have said the deliveries are
unprofitable because the prices the government pays are too low.
   As meat became scarce, consumers bought more dairy products,
fish and flour, which they use to make dumplings for meatless
meals. Sugar also is in short supply because it is used in
preserving the season's fruit for later in the year.
   Under the new program intended to improve supplies, farmers are
to be freed to sell their produce to whoever they want at whatever
prices they can get.
   Government food subsidies will remain stable, however.
State-owned stores and food processors are supposed to pass their
added purchasing costs to consumers.
   Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka, who opposed introducing the
program at this time, estimated it could raise prices 300 to 400
percent.
   ``I don't care what the prices are anymore,'' said a teacher who
refused to stand in a three-hour line for bread at another Warsaw
shop. ``Let them raise them. I simply want to be able to buy what I
need.''
   But other consumers were worried about price increases.
   ``If I make from 24,000 to 30,000 (zloties a month or about $29
to $36), I can't even dream of buying better meat or a piece of
ham,'' said one elderly woman interviewed on state television.
   The average monthly wage in Poland is about $127 dollars. On the
private market, meat can cost up to $4.30 a pound.

<TEXT>
   A congressman said Monday he is changing plans
in a bid to gain more support for House action on his proposal to
delay implementation of major parts of the Medicare catastrophic
health program.
   The delay bill introduced by Rep. Harris W. Fawell, R-Ill., is
among various measures in Congress to revise or repeal the Medicare
expansion which is being phased in over the three years that
started Jan. 1.
   However, Fawell is the only legislator who has filed a formal
petition to force his bill directly onto the House floor rather
than going through the Ways and Means Committee, which deals with
such legislation.
   His parliamentary maneuver requires 218 signatures to succeed,
enough to pass a bill on the House floor.
   In what he said was largely an appeal to fellow members, Fawell
held a news conference to announce that he was revising the
proposed rule of action, under which his legislation would be taken
up, to specifically allow for four amendments to be debated on the
House floor.
   Fawell said he hoped that would encourage House members to sign
his petition to gain full debate of the issue even if they don't
necessarily support his call for a one-year delay.

   Robin Higgins, wife of Marine Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins, said Monday reports from Lebanon that her husband had
been executed were ``not pleasant'' but she did not know whether
they are true.
   President Bush told Mrs. Higgins that ``reports concerning
Rich's death are not confirmed,'' she said in a statement released
by her attorney, Gregory Craig.
   ``One thing I have learned over the past 17 months is that the
truth is hard to find, and it remains so,'' said Mrs. Higgins, 37,
who is a major in the Marine Corps and works at the Pentagon as a
public information officer.
   Mrs. Higgins did not come to work Monday, but arrived at the
building at midmorning with Higgins' 19-year-old daughter, Chrissy.
They remained secluded, out of reporters' sight.
   In her office, Mrs. Higgins' co-workers anxiously watched
television monitors for the latest news from Lebanon.
   In Chicago, Bush canceled plans to travel to Nevada and
Oklahoma, and returned to Washington to deal with the situation.
   ``I have been contacted by President Bush, who has offered his
personal support during this time of trial for the Higgins
family,'' Mrs. Higgins said, adding that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney had also pledged his support.
   Bush described Mrs. Higgins as a ``stoic individual who is going
through sheer hell.''
   ``Needless to say, the news from Beirut is not pleasant,'' Mrs.
Higgins said. ``I must, however, await confirmation. I have seen
the reports and have not reached any conclusion myself.'' She urged
Americans not to draw any premature conclusions ``during this
terrible time of uncertainty.''
   Television networks broadcast a videotape Monday showing
pictures of a dead body purporting to be that of Higgins, 44.
Higgins is one of nine Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems in Lebanon.
   Peggy Say, the sister of another Lebanon hostage, Associated
Press Correspondent Terry Anderson, urged American officials to
respond cautiously to Higgins' reported death.
   ``What we have witnessed, in the Israeli retaliation in kind for
the kidnapping of their people, (is) that violence truly does beget
violence and that I hope the United States will use this
opportunity for reconciliation rather than retaliation,'' Mrs. Say
said in an interview from her home near Cadiz, Ky.
   ``An eye for an eye only leaves both sides blind.''
   In her statement, Mrs. Higgins appealed to those holding Higgins
to ``put an end to this needless cycle of violence and
victimization by releasing my husband right now and sending him
home.''
   Craig said Mrs. Higgins wanted to be left alone by reporters and
he urged outsiders to show ``respect for the Higgins' privacy.''
   Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, said Mrs. Higgins met with
the defense secretary on Saturday at the Pentagon before both spoke
to a group of families whose relatives who are prisoners of war or
are missing in Southeast Asia.
   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher, said from her home in the
Louisville, Ky., suburb of Okolona that she believed Higgins'
probably was dead even before she saw the videotape. ``How can I
doubt it,'' she said.
   Mrs. Fisher said she had spoken with officials with the State
Department but would not reveal what she was told.
   Higgins' aunt, Leona Huffman, awaited some official confirmation
at her home in Lancaster, Ky.
   ``I'm just not going to believe anything until I hear direct,''
said Mrs. Huffman, sister of the colonel's late mother.

<HEAD>Convictions, Sentences Upheld for Howard Beach Defendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court on Monday unanimously upheld
the convictions and sentences of three young men who took part in
the 1986 Howard Beach attack, in which a black man fleeing a white
gang was hit by a car and killed.
   In doing so, the court affirmed the trial judge's ruling that
defense attorneys, like prosecutors, may not use peremptory
challenges to exclude jurors on the basis of race.
   ``A message loud and clear must go forth that racial violence by
any person or group, whatever their race, will not be tolerated by
a just and civilized society, and that, when it does occur, it must
be appropriately punished,'' wrote the five justices from the state
Appellate Division in Brooklyn.
   In the first decision, the three defendants had argued that the
evidence introduced at their trial did not justify their
convictions and that certain confessions were tainted and should
have been suppressed.
   But the justices disagreed.
   Defense attorneys also had objected to a ruling by the trial
judge, Justice Thomas Demakos, that limited them in barring blacks
from the jury.
   Demakos cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that prosecutors could
not use peremptory challanges to exclude jurors on the basis of
race. The high court ruling did not specifically say whether
defense attorneys could do the same.
   The appeals court said the ruling did not affect the outcome of
the trial, since the only black juror seated as a result of the
ruling was excused before deliberations.
   Scott Kern, 20, Jon Lester, 20, and Jason Ladone, 18, were
convicted in December 1987 of second-degree manslaughter and
first-degree assault for attacking three black men in the Howard
Beach section of Queens on Dec. 20, 1986. One of the black men,
23-year-old Michael Griffith, was struck by a car and killed as he
fled.
   Another man, Cedric Sandiford, was beaten with a baseball bat
and tree limbs.
   Lester was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison, Kern received
a six- to 18-year term and Ladone was sentenced to five to 15
years. Kern and Ladone had their sentences stayed pending the
appeal. Lester, who was sentenced to one to three years in prison
on an unrelated prior conviction for weapons possession, is in jail.
   ``This is a precedent,'' said Charles L. Weintraub, a lawyer for
the three defendants. ``The Supreme Court has never said that this
applies to defense lawyers.''
   He said he would ask the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, to hear the case.
   In a separate decision, the justices also upheld the six-month
sentence given to a fourth defendant who testified for the
prosecution.
   Robert Riley was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty
to first-degree assault. He had asked that the sentence be reduced,
but the justices ruled it was ``neither harsh nor excessive.''
   His attorney, Richard E. Mischel, said Riley would surrender
when notified by the court.

<HEAD>Bush Summons Nation's Governors to Education Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new graf 4, bgng ``Afterward, Bush,'' with details on
trip cancellation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring that ``together we can
raise the level of learning in the classrooms of America,'' on
Monday summoned the nation's governors to a September summit on
education.
   The Sept. 27-28 meeting at a still unselected site will be only
the third time in U.S. history that a president has convened the
governors to help meet a pressing national problem.
   Bush, in a speech overshadowed by the reported hanging of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins by Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon,
also enlisted the governors' aid to combat drugs and crime, and
encouraged them to pursue trade with Poland and Hungary.
   Afterward, Bush returned immediately to the White House. He
canceled the rest of a two-day Western trip to address conventions
of Disabled American Veterans in Las Vegas, Nev., and the Fraternal
Order of Police in Oklahoma City.
   Bush told the 50 state chief executives: ``To cure our nation of
illiteracy, drug abuse and crime, we must act in tandem, president
with governor, and governor with mayor, up and down the line. In
short, we must find our collective will as a nation.''
   ``Today we do not meet in a spirit of immediate crisis. The
nation is sound,'' declared Bush. ``But the decline of our
educational system, the threat of crime and drugs, the economic
dependency of so many _ these problems threaten to endanger the
very leadership position of America in the next century.''
   ``A nation in which a half of our youth is ignorant of
geography, in which drugs are rampant, in which a substantial
proportion of the population knows little hope _ such a nation will
not long remain competitive,'' he said.
   These problems, he said, ``are issues of our national
well-being, even our national security.''
   ``Only twice before have the governors met with the president on
an issue of vital national importance. Now there will be a third
such conference, an historic meeting on education,'' said Bush.
   The first time was when Teddy Roosevelt brought the governors to
the White House ``to call for conservation, for an end to the
reckless denuding of our forests,'' Bush said. The second was when
Franklin D. Roosevelt sought the governors' help on how to meeting
on how to ``stem the financial crisis of the Great Depression.''
   ``Working together, we can find ways to strengthen our schools,
to enlarge opportunities and to improve our nation's educational
performance,'' said the president. ``Together we can raise the
level of learning in the classrooms of America,'' he said.
   Bush claimed a $400 million-plus package of education reforms he
sent Congress in April would help ``redeem the future of millions
of children.''
   That package includes new support for magnet schools and
programs in which parents can choose the public school their child
attends.
   ``The essence of reform is accountability in education and
reward for those schools that show progress,'' Bush said.
   Bush campaigned on a promise to convene an education summit of
the governors.
   While no surprise, his announcement got a receptive response
from the state chiefs.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who is the incoming
chairman of the National Governors Association, said the governors
welcomed the chance to work with Bush on ``developing consensus
goals to improve the quality of education.
   ``We want to involve all the people in this nation that are
concerned about rebuilding and strengthening'' the schools,
Branstad said.
   Two Democratic governors, in different ways, asked Bush whether
he stood ready to provide more funds for education.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton asked what the federal role was in
helping send more needy students to college ``so that they can be
internationally competitive.''
   ``Clearly the federal government has a role,'' replied Bush.
   But ``every time we get to worthy goals I have to say, `Wait,
how do we meet Gramm-Rudman targets in all of that?''' Bush said.
   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, after a long preamble about the
need to improve literacy in the South and educate a better
workforce, concluded, ``What I'm trying to say, Mr. President, is
`Send money!'''
   Bush laughd and replied that he hoped the education summit would
afford an opportunity ``to take a considerable amount of time to
discuss these kinds of issues.''

<HEAD>Farm Prices From June to July Show Slight Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers received for raw products
dropped 0.7 percent from June to July, but were up 2.8 percent from
a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that decreases in the prices for oranges,
broilers, soybeans and corn were partially offset by higher prices
for potatoes, cotton, tomatoes and hogs.
   ``Prices of cattle, potatoes, milk and lettuce contributed most
to the increase over a year ago. Lower prices for soybeans, corn,
apples and oranges were partially offsetting.'' the report said.
   The July index of prices paid for commodities and services,
interest, taxes and farm wage rates was 178 percent of its 1977
average. The index was was 0.6 percent above April of this year and
3.5 percent above July of last year.
   ``Higher prices during July for feeder cattle and calves,
gasoline and building materials were partially offset by lower feed
prices,'' the report said.
   Net cash income of farmers, according to Agriculture Department
economists, is expected to fall 5 percent to 14 percent this year
to a range of $50 billion to $55 billion from the record 1988 level
of $58 billion.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. Cash income rose last year despite drought partly
because of higher market prices and crops farmers had stored from
previous harvests.
   The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger
cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower
federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA to rise an average of
4 percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase
in 1988.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products as a group declined 0.6 percent from June to
July but still averaged 6.1 percent above last year's figure.
   Overall crop prices declined 2.9 percent from last month and 2.2
percent from July 1988.
   The all fruit index was down 20 percent from last month and 19
percent from a year ago.
   ``Most of the decrease from last month was due to declining
prices for oranges and strawberries,'' the report said. ``The only
fruits in the index showing an increase in prices were lemons and
peaches.''
   The report said:
   _The mid-July corn price of $2.43 per bushel was 9 cents lower
than June, while oats declined 17 cents to $1.65 per bushel.
   _Barley averaged $2.21 per bushel, down 12 cents from last month.
   _Soybeans were $6.75 per bushel, down 31 cents from June this
year and a drop from $8.50 a year ago.
   _Cattle averaged $67.60 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, the same as last month and up from $63.20 a year ago.
Those are the averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $46 per 100 pounds, up from last month's $45.10
and $44.10 in July 1988.
   _Eggs on the norm were 56.6 cents per dozen, a 1 percent
increase from last month's 55.6 cents and last year's 49.5 cents.
   _Broilers were 39.1 cents per pound in July, down 3.5 cents from
July's 42.6 cents and last year's 41.5.

<TEXT>
   A man who chained himself in his home
for three weeks to stop smoking said Monday it was worth it to
break his 20-year habit.
   Thomas Warren, 42, celebrated the removal Sunday of the thin,
25-foot steel cable _ which stretched from a 280-pound sofa in his
living room to form a collar around his neck _ by dining with
friends and later jogged two miles.
   A former marathon runner, Warren developed severe respiratory
problems from smoking cigarettes.
   Warren, an artist, dog trainer and drug counselor, said he
unsuccessfully tried everything to end his nicotine addiction. He
finally resorted to having his friends chain him up on July 9 and
rid his home of tobacco.
   Warren said some people laughed at his plan.
   ``I had some people who said sarcastically, `Couldn't you do it
on your own?' There are some people who can't do it on their own.
They need to be tied up or in treatment,'' he said.
   Warren, who beat a cocaine addiction 12 years ago, says a number
of current and former smokers telephoned or wrote.
   ``I had people call and say, `I gave up drugs years ago, I gave
up everything, but I'm still smoking and I know what you're going
through,''' Warren said.
   And Warren says it will be a daily battle not to light up again.
   Warren said Harvard researchers told him he has only a 10
percent chance of going two years without smoking because of his
``Type A'' personality and former drug addiction.
   ``That's baloney to me,'' he said. ``I'm not run by my desires
anymore. I have the power to say no. I'm not going to allow any
mistakes to occur.''
   Warren said sometimes during his ordeal he felt embarrassed
about being on a leash.
   ``Even though some people thought I was a fool, and I felt like
a foolish person at times, that's OK,'' he said. ``If there's any
smokers out there who think this was funny and laughed about it,
just remember: I bet I have the last breath.''

<HEAD>Feds Fine Philipp Bros. Record $4 Million For Alleged Futures Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philipp Brothers Inc., a New York-based
commodity futures trading concern, and three affiliates have agreed
to pay a record $4 million in penalties to settle allegations of
fraud in cocoa futures contracts, federal regulators said Monday.
   Philipp Brothers is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Wall Street
investment firm Salomon Inc., but federal officials said present
management at Salomon was not involved in any alleged wrongdoing.
   ``This is by far the largest civil penalty ever imposed by this
commission,'' said Dennis Klejna, director of enforcement for the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The CFTC, which regulates U.S. futures markets, charged in a
19-count administrative complaint that Philipp Brothers and others
engaged in several deceptive practices, including the ractice of
``bucketing.''
   In bucketing, a broker misrepresents trades by buying or selling
futures contracts off the floor of a futures exchange, while
telling the customer the trades were made on the exchange.
   In the current case, the CFTC charged Philipp Brothers told
customers their trades were being handled on the Coffee, Cocoa and
Sugar Exchange in New York, when the trades actually were handled
on the exchange floor.
   Klejna said brokers who use the practice may avoid paying fees
to the exchange.
   ``Customers never really held a futures position on the
exchange,'' said Klejna. ``They thought they did, when in fact they
had orders that were booked at the firm.''
   ``The customer nevertheless was required to pay the same
commissions, fees and margin (collateral deposited to buy futures)
charged for properly executed transactions and positions,''
according to the complaint.
   About 100,000 cocoa futures were bought or sold in this manner,
carrying commission fees of about $16 each or a total of $1.65
million, said Klejna.
   Philipp Bros. said in a statement that the activities ``were
inititally brought to the attention of the CFTC by the present
management of Philipp Bros. as a result of an internal
investigation. Current management subsequently cooperated
thoroughly with the CFTC.''
   Klejna said one reason the fine was so large is that the alleged
violations went on so long _ from July 1981 through September 1984.
   The commission also alleged Philipp Brothers and others entered
into improper pre-arranged trades and fictitious sales, and failed
to accurately prepare order tickets.
   The affiliates _ Phibro Corporation and Philipp Brothers
Commodities Corp., both of New York, and Cocoa Merchants Ltd. of
London _ settled the allegations without admitting or denying
guilt, said Klejna.
   In addition to the companies, five former employees of Philipp
Brothers were charged in the complaint and have not yet settled
with the CFTC. Named by the commission were Anthony H.D. Weldon, of
London; Daniel F. Tulig, of Sparta, N.J.; Peter Gilliam, of Surrey,
England; Esther Lander Greenfield, of Monsey, N.Y.; and Mark
Glowatz, of East Meadow, N.Y.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspaper Publishes Solzhenitsyn's Criticism of Lenin</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper reprinted a Time magazine
interview with exiled author Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn in which he
calls Vladimir Lenin ``evil'' _ a shocking description for those
who consider the Soviet founder a virtual god.
   Publication of the article in this week's mass-circulation Za
Rubezhom is remarkable both in its criticism of Lenin and as an
interview with Solzhenitsyn, whose writings were banned in the
Soviet Union from 1962 until March this year.
   In the past four months Soviet journals have published two
Solzhenitsyn essays. Novy Mir, the nation's leading literary
magazine, is preparing to publish excerpts of ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's account of Soviet political prison
camps.
   In the Time interview, Solzhenitsyn said Lenin was ``uncommonly
evil.'' When asked what he meant by evil, Solzhenitsyn replied,
``The absence of any mercy, the absence of any humanity in his
approach to the people, the masses, to anyone who did not follow
him precisely.''
   Za Rubezhom carried a comment on that reply.
   An adjacent article, signed by historian A.M. Sovokin, said
Solzhenitsyn must have ``defective sight'' to ascribe such
characteristics to Lenin. Solzhenitsyn writes of Lenin and the
Bolshevik Revolution ``in a spirit of prejudice and intolerance,''
Sovokin said.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost or
openness, former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev
have been blamed for many of the country's problems. But Lenin _
whose statue holds a prominent place in every Soviet city _ was
above criticism until June.
   At that time, a magazine published the late Vasily Grossman's
short novel, ``Forever Flowing,'' in which he accuseds Lenin of
contempt for freedom and cruelty to his opponents.
   The Za Rubezhom article also told Soviets that Solzhenitsyn
still faces criminal charges for treason in his homeland.
   In the Time interview Solzhenitsyn described the Bolshevik
Revolution as a ``coup d'etat'' and said the Bolsheviks themselves
called it the ``October coup'' through the 1920s.
   The Nobel Literature prize winner, who was exiled in 1974, lives
in Cavendish, Vt. He said in the interview that he will not return
to his homeland until his Soviet history, ``The Red Wheel,'' is
published and available in every bookstore in the Soviet Union.
   However, sources in the Soviet Writers' Union, which reinstated
him in July, said they expect Solzhenitsyn to visit his homeland,
possibly as soon as autumn.
   The Soviet government has moved toward rehabilitating
Solzhenitsyn, who is seen by some countrymen as a prophet of free
speech and by others as an embodiment of of Russian nationalism.
The Writers' Union, which publishes Novy Mir, has urged the
government to reinstate his citizenship.

   A ``Fire Company'' toy containing small parts
that could pose a choking hazard to children is being recalled, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Monday.
   ``Fire Company'' includes a small red plastic fire engine, red
hook and ladder truck, two plastic firemen and a plastic street
railroad sign mounted on a display card and sold for $1 to $2.
   About 24,000 of the toys were sold from September 1987 to
September 1988, the commission said. They were imported by Larami
Corp. of Philadelphia.
   The display card contains the name ``Fire Company'' on top and,
at the bottom, ``Larami. Item No. 1134-0.'' The toys are labeled
``Made in Hong Kong.''
   The wheels and other small parts could become detached from the
fire trucks and pose a choking hazard, according to the safety
commission.
   The agency said the toys should be removed from use by children.
They can be returned to the retailer where purchased for a refund,
officials said.
   People needing more information can contact the safety
commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Ralston Purina in Puppy Food Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has awarded $10.4 million in
damages to ALPO Petfoods Inc. after ruling that Ralston Purina Co.
made false advertising claims touting the benefits of Purina Puppy
Chow.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled against
Ralston's marketing campaign, begun in 1985, in which the company
contended that its Puppy Chow products helped promote proper hip
joint development.
   Ralston will appeal the judgment, the company said Monday in a
statement from its St. Louis, Mo., headquarters.
   Sporkin also found that ALPO made false claims when it
advertised that veterinarians preferred ALPO's formula for puppy
food by a 2-to-1 margin over that of the leading brand, which was
Purina's Puppy Chow. He didn't order ALPO to pay any damages, but
enjoined both firms from engaging in false advertising.
   Ralston said its Puppy Chow diet helped reduce the incidence of
degenerative joint disease and canine hip dysplasia, which is
incurable and difficult to treat.
   ``With the exception of Ralston's own faulty research, there is
no valid scientific support for the proposition that the
nutritional balance in a dog's diet can affect'' hip joint
conditions, Sporkin said in a 54-page ruling.
   The ``overwhelming weight of scientific research indicates''
that the conditions ``are hereditary in nature and are unaffected
by the nutritional balance of a dog's diet,'' said the judge. He
called the research in support of the company's claim ``inadequate
and distorted.''
   Ralston launched a $5.2 million advertising campaign, declaring
that ``Puppy Chow helps prevent CHD.''
   Sporkin said the company had ``withheld vital information about
its research from the public, from government agencies and from the
court.
   At least one Ralston official, said the judge, ``ordered that
certain adverse information by destroyed.''
   ``We believe Judge Sporkin simply failed to grasp either the
facts or the relevant law in this case,'' Ralston spokesman Patrick
Farrell said in a statement. He said the decision would have ``a
chilling effect on corporate research'' if allowed to stand.
   In connection with ALPO's false claim that veterinarians
preferred its product, Sporkin said the firm ``lacked
substantiation'' for the assertion, which was based on a company
survey. Internal company documents prepared in June 1986
acknowledged that ALPO could no longer sustain its 2-to-1
preference claim, the judge noted.
   Sporkin also ordered both companies to send out corrective
information and to pay attorneys' fees.
   The judge's ruling, made Friday and issued publicly Monday, came
in a lawsuit filed by ALPO, which is the second-largest seller of
puppy food in the country, and a counterclaim filed by Ralston.
Ralston has been the leading puppy food seller in the country since
1964.

   Mom always told you that a smile and a
kind word go a long way. But in Lexington, good manners could help
you keep your job.
   Courtesy is the new municipal watchword in this town that once
cradled the American Revolution and now prides itself on efficient,
accountable government.
   ``It kind of puts our best foot forward,'' fire dispatcher John
Soares said after giving an unannounced visitor a very polite
welcome Monday. ``It's looking at taxpayers as customers.''
   Over the next year, all 285 town employees will be required to
take a courtesy course that includes telephone etiquette, grooming
tips and how to make the public feel like a valued client.
   Employees transferring telephone calls, for example, are taught
to give a quick briefing on the caller to help minimize frustration.
   ``When you pick up the call, you use the person's name and you
try to paraphrase the problem so they don't feel they have to
repeat their story over and over again,'' said Fire Chief John D.
Bergeron, a graduate of the course.
   ``Nice talking to you,'' he said cheerfully at the end of a
telephone interview.
   Lexington employees are getting the sort of training in customer
service that's used by such businesses as Motorola Corp.,
Northwestern Airlines and the Papa Gino's pizza chain, said Maya
Ollson, president of the Evergreen Training and Development Inc.
   The program is costing $50,000, said Town Manager Richard D.
White, who is preparing to mail cards to all 30,000 residents to
find out whether they're satisfied with service from city agencies.
   ``This is more than a courtesy issue, it's a whole system of
management,'' said White. ``We may get some pretty decent ideas
from people as to what services we provide are absolutely essential
and which aren't.''
   Ollson said although people may have gripes, they don't report
them because ``they don't know how or they don't think it'll do any
good.''
   Because of the state budget crisis, the town expects to see its
state aid cut by more than one-sixth this year. White said cutbacks
and layoffs may be inevitable.
   Customer satisfaction will be a factor when deciding where to
cut.
   ``If you're an agency that has a lot of complaints, you're
obviously a target when it comes to budget reductions,'' Bergeron
said.
   Some town residents polled said they had never been treated
rudely but they welcomed the reminders.
   ``I think people who work in the public like that could always
use a dose of treating people nicely _ especially over the phone,''
said Phyllis Cusanelli.

<HEAD>USDA Says 18 Indicted on Tobacco-Related Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Monday that 18
people have been indicted on tobacco-related charges, ranging from
conspiracy to false identification of tobacco, and federal agents
have started making arrests in the cases.
   The indictments, charging a total of 138 violations, stemmed
from a two-year investigation involving tobacco warehouse owners
who were accused of falsely identifying and marketing tobacco by
using illegally acquired marketing cards, USDA Deputy Inspector
General Leon Snead said in a statement.
   ``One warehouse owner was charged with using illegally obtained
marketing cards and his tobacco dealer card to sell excess tobacco
that he had purchased illegally from tobacco producers or stolen
from the warehouse floor,'' he said.
   The arrests Monday were made by agents of the USDA's office of
inspector general, the U.S. Marshals Service and Internal Revenue
Service.
   If convicted, the defendants could face fines of up to $10,000
and five years imprisonment on each count. They also could face
USDA administrative penalties.
   According to the USDA, the federal indictments were against
Glenn S. Martin Jr., 41, tobacco dealer and owner of Big Burley
Tobacco Warehouse, Johnson City, Tenn.; Graham Cole, 55, Moultrie,
Ga., tobacco dealer and owner of Planters Brick Tobacco Warehouse,
Pelham, Ga., and Peachtree Tobacco Co., Moultrie, Ga.

37, Bruno Guillen, 25, Mark Dawson, 26, Kenneth Dawson, 28, all of
Johnson City, Tenn.; Robert Nelson, 54, Kenneth Roberts, 42, both
of Jonesboro, Tenn.; Kenneth Meredith, 55, Elizabethton, Tenn.;
Alan Myers, 31, Charlotte's Courthouse, Va.

<HEAD>Lawyer Sentenced to One Year in Prison in Wells Fargo Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawyer was sentenced Monday to one year
in prison and fined $1,000 for his role in the $7.1 million robbery
of a Wells Fargo bank, believed to be the second-largest cash heist
in history.
   Paul S. Weinberg of Springfield, Mass., pleaded guilty last
September to a misdemeanor charge of aiding in the transportation
of stolen money.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie imposed the maximum sentence
and ordered Weinberg, 40, to surrender Aug. 28. He remains free on
$200,000 bond.
   The mastermind of the robbery, Harvard-educated Juan Segarra
Palmer of Puerto Rico, was sentenced in June to 65 years in prison
and fined $500,000. Segarra, a leader of a militant Puerto Rican
independence group, and three other Puerto Rican nationalists were
convicted in the 1983 threst of a half-ton of money from the
armored-car company's depot in West Hartford.
   Only $80,000 has been recovered.
   Weinberg got involved in the robbery conspiracy through his
friendship with Segarra, to whom Weinberg has admitted loaning
vehicles. Weinberg said he later suspected the vehicles were used
to tranport some of the stolen money.
   His guilty plea was part of an agreement between Weinberg and
federal prosecutors, who in turn dismissed four felony charges.
   Also, as part of the agreement, Weinberg promised to cooperate
with the government and to testify against defendants still
awaiting trial.
   ``You must realize there are consequences,'' Claire told
Weinberg. ``It's a serious matter, that's what I want to impress
upon you. It's not some trivia.''
   Clarie said Weinberg's plea to a misdemeanor count would not
disbar him in Massachusetts.
   Niether Weinberg nor his attorney, F. Mac Buckley, would comment
after the proceeding.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said after sentencing that
other charges could still be lodged against Weinberg, including
obstruction of justice, perjury and making a false statement to a
federal official.
   Those issues, Twardy said, ``should be wrapped up this fall.''

   China is honoring its 2.98 million soldiers with
awards, books and movies to celebrate the founding of the army and
polish the image of its troops as national heroes for crushing
pro-democracy protests.
   Tiananmen Square, the center of student-led demonstrations and
the military crackdown in June, now is under military guard.
Tuesday it will bustle with ceremonies marking the Aug. 1, 1927,
founding of the first unit of what became China's Red Army.
   The festivities come amid an official barrage of praise for the
estimated 150,000 troops ordered into Beijing to stop the
demonstrations.
   Last week, the Central Military Commission awarded the title of
``Guardian of the People's Republic of China'' to 12 soldiers and
officers wounded or killed during the June 3-4 military assaults.
   Orders conferring the award, signed by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, urged soldiers to ``follow their example, be loyal to the
country and the people and dare to sacrifice for the interests of
the people.''
   At an Army Day banquet Monday, Defense Minister Qin Jiwei
toasted the army, which he said ``faithfully performed its
fundamental duty and glorious mission ... for defending the
motherland, safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people, and
serving the people wholeheartedly.''
   The fanfare has been building for days. Television programs show
soldiers being entertained by singers, marching bands and acrobats
in programs attended by China's highest officials.
   Numerous books, movies and photo exhibitions have been produced
showing the official version of how the army subdued the
protesters. The accounts of angry crowds challenging the armed
troops express sympathy for the soldiers.
   Official reports claim that when troops stormed into Beijing the
night of June 3 they showed great restraint and fired only when
provoked. The government says more than 100 soldiers and police and
about 100 civilians were killed, including some innocent bystanders.
   Western witnesses, however, said the troops fired
indiscriminately, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of unarmed
civilians.
   A People's Daily editorial claimed some civilians insulted and
spat on the soldiers.
   ``The young army men were angry and would not have tolerated the
personal insults if they did not love the people,'' it said.
   But witnesses said one taunt from the crowd could draw a barrage
of fire from the young recruits.
   The army has had a reputation of closeness to the people. During
the civil war against the Nationalist Chinese the army's ironclad
discipline won support among China's peasants.
   A slogan about the troops, noted for rescue work during
disasters and help in harvesting crops, says the army ``goes with
the people like fish swim through water.''
   During seven weeks of massive, peaceful demonstrations before
the crackdown people felt confident enough to approach soldiers,
offer them food and drink and lecture them on the army's
responsibility not to hurt the people.
   Until June 3 soldiers did act with restraint. There was
high-level opposition to the armed attack on the protesters, and
some units refused to take part. In the end, discipline and unity
prevailed and the crackdown began.
   For days afterward, people expressed outrage at the violence.
   Now, after almost two months of repression and arrests, few
Chinese dare voice anything but the party line.
   An uneasy calm has settled over Beijing. Soldierswith automatic
rifles are posted at only a few major intersections but roving
patrols stop people late at night to check identification.
   Relations between the military and public remain tense. Martial
law troops reportedly have beaten and kicked arrested protesters.
Most troops keep a low profile, occasionally emerging from bivouacs
around the city to see tourist attractions.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Spend More on Crack-Addicted Newborns and Mothers</HEAD>

   More federal money is needed to combat crack
addiction among pregnant women and to provide care for addicted
newborns and their mothers, witnesses told a Senate panel Monday.
   ``As a country we have fostered a spiraling legacy of addicts
giving birth to addicts,'' Philadelphia social worker Teresa Ann
Hagan told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ``Must this
generation and future generations suffer due to our unwillingness
to act with urgency?''
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., chairman of the session, said the $7.5
million in federal spending on model treatment programs this year
amounts to $10 each for mother and child.
   ``The Department of Defense spends $35 million every single
hour,'' Kohl said. ``What has happened to our priorities here?''
   Kohl said three to six cocaine babies are born daily in
Milwaukee alone and at one of the city's hospitals, 35 percent of
those born this year will test positive for cocaine. Hagan said a
recent survey indicated that 16 percent of births in Philadelphia
hospitals were ``drug related.''
   Gregory L. Coler, secretary of the Florida Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services, said that in his state 2,000 people
are waiting for treatment at any given time and some simply give up
and return to drug abuse.
   He said the problem for infants born to addicted mothers is
serious.
   ``We see miscarriages, malformed limbs and eight-week-old babies
who have not gained weight since birth,'' he said.
   Sherry Agnos, wife of San Francisco's mayor, told the panel more
than 700 drug-exposed infants will be born in that city this year,
7 percent of all births citywide. She said 18 percent of newborns
at San Francisco General Hospital test positive for crack.
   She said San Francisco ``created a world model to confront the
AIDS epidemic'' and ``it paid off.'' She said AIDS costs are lower
per capita in San Francisco than anywhere else in the United States.
   ``We can do the same with crack cocaine if we are given the
support we need,'' she said.
   Hagan, program and clinical coordinator at the Family Center at
Thomas Jefferson University, said addition repeats itself from one
generation to the next and is deeply rooted in the nation's social
problems.
   She cited a Family Center study showing nearly 70 percent of
drug addicted women were abused sexually before the age of 16
compared to 15 percent of non-addicted women.
   Eighty-three percent of addicted women had a chemically
dependent parent, with 75 percent of those parents alcoholic. In
contrast, 35 percent of the non-addicted women had a chemically
dependent parent.
   She was accompanied by Elaina Wilcox, a patient at the Family
Center, who said that she had started using narcotics at age 15
after being abused and ``filtered through the child welfare
system.''
   ``Drug addicted mothers love their children just like any other
mother,'' she said.
   Minnie Thomas, an Oakland, Calif., social worker, told the
committee that her Mandela house treatment center has only six beds
for mothers and six beds for newborns and that young women
sometimes call her on the telephone and beg for a chance to get
into her drug program, even if it means sleeping on the couch.

<HEAD>Government Says Hospitals Need Lower Costs, Not More Money</HEAD>

   Many rural hospitals are losing money because
their costs are too high, not because Medicare reimbursements are
too low, a government report concluded Monday.
   The report by the inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services dismissed the belief by many in the hospital
industry that the government's payment for Medicare patients is
jeopardizing the financial health of hospitals, particularly those
in rural areas.
   HHS Inspector General Richard Kusserow's report said his
office's study found rural hospitals that achieved a profit on
Medicare patients had lower costs than comparable hospitals with
losses in the program.
   In 1987, the most recent year for which data is available, 956
rural hospitals, or 43 percent, earned Medicare profits while 1,255
rural hospitals, or 57 percent, had Medicare losses.
   Since all the rural hospitals received about the same Medicare
revenues per patient, the key difference was their costs per
patient, the report said.
   ``Nonprofitable rural hospitals are unable to make profits from
treating Medicare patients because their costs are too high,'' the
report concluded.
   ``In our opinion, unprofitable rural hospitals should not look
to the Medicare program for financial salvation,'' the report said.
   The report said rural hospitals losing money under Medicare tend
to be smaller than their profitable counterparts, have fewer beds,
lower occupancy, more staff per occupied bed and keep patients
longer.
   Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, co-chairman of the Rural Health Care
Coalition, disagreed with the inspector general's conclusion,
saying rural hospitals ``are desperately working to keep their
costs low and still are struggling.
   ``It's very clear that the current Medicare formula is working
against them,'' Tauke said. ``Historically, rural hospitals have
kept their costs down and as a result they are being penalized by
the current system.''
   The HHS report said federal officials should encourage rural
hospitals to consolidate with other under-utilized facilities and
to convert excess beds to other uses.
   ``In the short run, hospital administators must turn to such
cost-controlling measures as ensuring that they keep patients in
the hospitals no longer than necessary and employ only the number
of staff members required to provide appropriate patient care,''
the report said.

<TEXT>
   Outgoing Customs Commissioner William von Raab
took a few last jabs Monday at colleagues who, he says, are not
sufficiently committed to the war on drugs.
   At the 200th anniversary celebration of the Customs Service, in
his letter of resignation, an interview and a news conference, von
Raab zinged:
   _Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, his boss, for allegedly not
supporting him.
   _Unidentified State Department bureaucrats and their ``quest to
make the world safe for cocktail parties.''
   _``Political jockeying, backstabbing and malaise'' in the
anti-drug effort.
   And von Raab said he toned his speech down at Brady's request.
   Including parts of his resignation letter in his speech, von
Raab said, `Maybe it is time for the war on drugs to take its place
as our nation's top priority _ to interfere with other interests
such as banking and Third World debt.''
   About the only person exempted from von Raab's lash was William
Bennett, whom he praised as ``a courageous man.''
   In his own defense, von Raab said, ``If we dared to speak out,
it was because those in our own government were too scared to speak
up'' about drug trafficking by those such as Gen. Manuel Noriega of
Panama.
   Brady sat expressionless on stage through von Raab's remarks,
staring at the Washington Monument. In his own comments, Brady
praised interagency cooperation and said the drug war ``is a war we
are going to win.''
   Von Raab did not shake hands with Brady at the close of the
ceremony, though he did with many others.
   The customs commissioner, denied reappointment by President Bush
to the job he has held for eight years, has been sharply critical
of other officials in recent interviews. He said Monday was his
last day on the job.
   ``I'm quitting, obviously, because I'm not getting along with
Secretary Brady,'' von Raab told reporters.
   The commissioner said Brady had stopped the policy of ``zero
tolerance'' of drug users and traffickers that had resulted in one
case in the seizure of a yacht because of the presence of one
marijuana cigarette.
   In addition, von Raab said, Brady had refused to go along with
his plan to offer a bounty for the seizure of drug kingpins abroad,
and he criticized the lack of discussion of the drug problem when
the United States and Mexico negotiated a debt-relief plan.
   But Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Roger Bolton said in an
interview that Congress, not Brady, modified the zero tolerance
policy, and a Treasury official has forwarded von Raab's bounty
proposal ``with a pretty strong recommendation'' to Bennett.
   Bolton confirmed that the drug issue did not come up in the
Mexican debt negotiations.
   Although von Raab said Brady is ``an honorable man, he's a
gentleman,'' he noted that Brady did not mention his imminent
departure during the ceremony.
   Asked later whether it wasn't disingenuous of him to claim he
couldn't understand Brady's lack of warmth in light of his recent
statements and his resignation letter, von Raab simply shrugged,
smiled and walked away.
   Bolton confirmed that Brady asked von Raab to soften his speech.
An early draft, he said, included ``direct criticism of other
departments, such as State, Commerce and Justice, which were not
the Treasury Department's views.''
   Von Raab said he plans to take a month off, then return to
Washington ``to see if anybody wants to employ me.'' He did not
respond when asked if he planned to run for office.

<HEAD>Weapons Plants Cleanup May Cost $17 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department proposes to spend as
much as $17.2 billion over the next five years to begin cleaning up
the nation's nuclear weapons production plants so they meet
environmental concerns, department sources said Monday.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins is expected to provide a
blueprint of the five-year cleanup program in a speech before the
National Press Club on Tuesday, including the expected cost
estimates for the first five years.
   The five-year program, details of which will be announced later
this month, is the center of a long-term plan to restore confidence
in the weapons plants and their operation.
   The department has said in the past that the overall cleaup bill
for the 17 plants in a dozen states likely will exceed $90 billion.
   Since Watkins became head of the department last March, he has
had a team of senior aides develop a plan aimed at correcting
decades of environmental and safety neglect at the weapons plants.
   Initial cleanup cost estimates over the next five years
submitted to Watkins are about $2.4 billion during the first year
and as much as $3.7 billion a year during the subsequent four
years, according to department sources.
   The sources spoke on the condition they not be identified by
name. Watkin's estimates were initially reported Monday by the
Washington Post based on an interview with the secretary.
   Department officials have refrained from attempting to gauge how
long the cleanup will take and plan to develop specific action
plans over five-year increments.
   A series of incidents at some of the weapons plants has raised
serious health and safety questions. Watkins has said past
operation of the plants has failed to ensure the protection of the
environment and public health and that public confidence in the
program has eroded badly.
   Meanwhile, the department announced Monday that it has reached
agreement with Westinghouse Electric Corp. on a joint approach in
setting a schedule for restarting production reactors at Savannah
River, the country's largest nuclear weapons plant.
   Westinghouse operates the facility in South Carolina.
   The site's three reactors have been shut down for more than a
year because of environmental and safety concerns. The reactors
produce tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen used in atomic
warheads.
   Department officials declined comment on a report in the New
York Times that Westinghouse had estimated the cost of repairing
and restarting the three reactors would be as much as $1.66
billion, or more than four times what had been previously estimated.
   According to the Times, the higher cost estimates were provided
in a confidential report from Westinghouse to the department on
June 26. One department sources said that Watkins had rejected the
June 26 proposal because of both its high cost estimate and
proposed restart schedule.
   The department gave no cost estimates in its announcement
Monday, but said the department and Westinghouse had established a
deadline of Sept. 1 for reaching agreement on a reactor restart
schedule that would not jeopardize the weapons program or safety.
   There has been concern about a shortage of tritium unless the
reactors can be restarted in timely fashion. Westinghouse has
indicated to the department it could not restart the recards before
late 1990, a schedule that in the past has been criticized by
Watkins.

<NOTE>THE `EXECUTION'</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian group known as the Organization of the Oppressed
on Earth issued a statement in Beirut that said it hanged Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins on Monday to retaliate for Israel's abduction
Friday of Moslem cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. An hour after the
reported execution, it released a poor-quality, 30-second videotape
showing a man dangling from a gallows, but there was no indication
when the tape was made. No body was found.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE SKEPTICISM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   State Department officials said they found reports that the man
in the videotape was Higgins to be credible, but could not say
whether it was made Monday or earlier. Arab analysts in Israel said
Israeli and other intelligence services and U.N. officials had
received reports recently indicating Higgins was killed in July
1988 or in December 1988.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEW THREATS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A group known as the Revolutionary Justice Organization gave a
statement to a Beirut newspaper with a photograph of Joseph James
Cicippio and said it would kill the 58-year-old American unless
Israel freed Obeid by 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   An anonymous caller claiming to speak for the Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth telephoned the Nicosia, Cyprus, office of
The Associated Press and said it would kill Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite on Tuesday unless Obeid was released. It could not be
verified if the caller was from the organization.

<NOTE>ISRAELI REACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli army said Obeid had confessed to personal
involvement in planning, guiding and aiding the abduction of
Higgins, and he revealed the names of Higgins' captors.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel
remains ready to trade Obeid for Israeli and Western hostages.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens reacted cautiously to Higgins'
reported execution, saying, ``We have no proof.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BUSH REACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush cut short a trip to Chicago and met with his
national security advisers. Although he cautioned he had no
confirmation of Higgins' execution, he said: ``I know I speak for
all here when I try to express to the American people the sense of
outrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality, this
uncalled-for terrorism.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONGRESSIONAL REACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional reaction ranged from calls for revenge to warnings
that such moves would only worsen conditions in the Middle East,
and it triggered debate over Israel's role, with Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole saying: ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on
the part of the Israelis one of these days would be refreshing.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>U.N. REACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed
``outrage and revulsion'' at the reported murder of Higgins, who
commanded a group of U.N. truce observers in southern Lebanon when
he was seized. The Security Council unanimously adopted a
resolution that ``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking
and abduction.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FAMILY REACTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Higgins' wife, Robin, said the reports from Lebanon were ``not
pleasant'' but she did not know whether they are true: ``One thing
I have learned over the past 17 months is that the truth is hard to
find, and it remains so.''
   Peggy Say, the sister of hostage Terry Anderson, urged a
cautious response: ``What we have witnessed, in the Israeli
retaliation in kind for the kidnapping of their people, (is) that
violence truly does beget violence and that I hope the United
States will use this opportunity for reconciliation rather than
retaliation.''

   A tornado swept through a shanty
district early Monday, killing at least five people, as monsoon
rains and strong winds buffeted Manila and the main Philippine
island of Luzon, officials said.
   At least six other people were injured when the cyclone swept
through the suburb of Malabon, blowing down walls and ripping roofs
off shanties, the Office of Civil Defense reported.
   The bodies of a man, his wife and two daughters aged 4 and 6
were found in the debris of a shanty after the storm blew down the
firewall of an adjacent factory, the office said.
   Another man who was injured in the incident died later, said
spokeswoman Emilia Tadeo. At least 18 houses were flattened while
the roofs of 30 more houses were blown off, and 25 families were
evacuated to schools in the area.
   In San Fernando, 140 miles north of Manila, officials issued
flood warnings for residents along the Agno river in Pangasinan
province.
   Officials said water levels in the river rose dramatically
Sunday after seven floodgates in the Binga dam were opened
following heavy rains.
   Radio stations reported flooding in at least three towns in the
province.
   Red Cross officials said monsoon rains spawned by two tropical
storms which skirted the northern Philippines over the weekend
caused floods and triggered landslides in northern Luzon.
   Ireneo Zabala, Red Cross relief supervisor, said houses in
coastal towns of Cavite province near Manila were also destroyed by
strong winds.
   The state-run Philippines News Agency said heavy rains weakened
bridge supports in northwestern Luzon, stranding thousands of
motorists.

<HEAD>State Department Issues Kenya Travel Warning Following Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department issued a travel advisory
Monday to Americans going to Kenya following attacks on tourists
including the shooting death of a Connecticut woman last week.
   ``There have been a few instances of attacks on tourists along
the coast south of Mombasa and in remote areas of the country,
including some national parks. Most of these attacks, some of which
resulted in deaths of tourists, have been attributed to heavily
armed wildlife poachers,'' the advisory said.
   ``When visiting game parks, Americans are encouraged to travel
in groups with a guide from a reputable safari firm or a game
ranger.''
   Marie Magdefrau Ferraro, 50, of Bethany, Conn., was shot to
death Thursday when two bandits armed with assault rifles emerged
from nearby bushes and began firing at a van carrying a Connecticut
Audubon Society wildlife tour group.
   It was originally suspected that the attackers were ivory
poachers. The Kenyan government has imposed a severe crackdown on
poachers who kill elephants for their ivory tusks.
   But tour leader Milan Bull, who returned with the group Sunday,
told The Hartford Courant that he believes the attackers were
deserters from the Somalian army.
   The ambush was the latest in a series of attacks against
tourists in Kenya.
   In April, three Germans were wounded in an ambush near where the
Connecticut group was attacked. Four weeks ago, two French tourists
were shot to death by poachers in Meru National Park. And last week
two Americans were beaten up while on horseback safari.
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., had urged the State
Department to impose a travel advisory last week following the
attack.
   ``Using high-powered weapons, and with disregard for any
authority, these criminals are roaming the countryside and preying
on innocent victims,'' the senator said.
   Meanwhile, Ms. Ferraro's body is expected to be returned to the
United States sometime this week, State Department officials said.
   ``Our consul there has been working all weekend on it,'' said
one department official, who asked not to be identified. ``These
things take time and require a lot of paper (work) and are
complicated. But there is no delay that I'm aware of.''

   Liberal Democratic Party leader Ryutaro Hashimoto,
who was considered the top contender to replace Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno, said Monday he would not seek that office, according
to news reports.
   Hashimoto, secretary general of the governing party, made his
statement after leaders of a key party faction decided not to make
him their candidate, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. and several
newspapers reported.
   The leader of the Liberal Democrats customarily becomes prime
minister because of the party's majority in Parliament's lower
house.
   Leaders of three factions made their decision not to back any
current or former faction members during a three-hour meeting
Sunday at the home of Shin Kanemaru, said Hiroaki Toshinari, a
party spokesman.
   Kanemaru is former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's mentor.
Takeshita and Hashimoto resigned from their party faction as part
of reforms during an influence-buying scandal that forced Takeshita
to resign on June 2.
   The decision not to back anyone was made by Kanemaru, who heads
the faction, and senior members Ichiro Ozawa and Keiwa Okuda. Okuda
heads the party's Parliamentary Policy Committee and Ozawa is a
former party deputy secretary general.
   They made the decision because the faction had played a crucial
role in choosing Uno and his Cabinet when Takeshita resigned,
Toshinari said. Uno announced July 24 he too would step down
because of the party's losses in Senate elections the previous day.
There also were reports he paid geishas for sex.
   The faction leaders also reportedly decided not to support
Hashimoto because he lacks a strong following within the faction.
Hashimoto, who at 52 is the youngest man ever to hold the party's
No. 2 post, has been criticized as inexperienced.
   A replacement for Uno is expected to be chosen Aug. 8 in a
meeting of the party's parliamentary caucus.
   Takeshita's former faction is by far the largest of six major
factions within the party.

   Reports that Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
was hanged by his pro-Iranian captors inspired outrage around the
world Monday and criticism of Israel's abduction a Moslem cleric,
which caused the retaliation.
   Condemnation came from countries as ideologically different as
Britain and Syria.
   Foreign Secretary John Major said in London that, if the reports
were true, ``this is coldblooded murder, brazen savagery of the
worst sort and quite unforgivable.''
   Syria, which supported Iran in its war with Iraq, said:
``Killing Higgins, who was not guilty of anything, is a crime that
violates all humanitarian principles and norms.''
   The American Marine's kidnappers, who call themselves the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, said they killed him in
retaliation for Israel's abduction from south Lebanon on Friday of
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Israel has offered to trade him and other Shiite prisoners for
three Israeli soldiers and other foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon,
said ``If it's true it's one of the saddest days for all
peacekeepers in the world.'' Higgins commanded a group of U.N.
truce observers in south Lebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988.
   Iran did not comment immediately after the report, but a leading
official earlier had defended the kidnappers' threats to kill
Higgins.
   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militant
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests
of Israel and the United States,'' Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi told reporters.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said: ``The threat against
Higgins has nothing to do with us. ... We condemn any kind of
kidnapping or death threat,'' he said.
   Many officials questioned the veracity of the claim Higgins had
been killed Monday, which was accompanied by a poor-quality
videotape showing a man hanging from a scaffold. There have been
reports that his captors killed the American last year.
   ``If it is true, the news of the murder of Col. Higgins can only
inspire a sentiment of horror,'' the French Foreign Ministry said
Monday.
   Nasouh Majali, Jordan's information minister, said ``This is
horrible.'' Before the report that Higgins had been killed, Majali
called the abduction of Obeid ``an act of terror.'' He said the
Israelis ``are condemning terror and they are using the same
means,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson of Sweden said killing Higgins
was ``a heinous crime'' that should be condemned along with Obeid's
abduction.
   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that
``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and abduction.''
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed ``outrage
and revulsion ... that an innocent man, serving the United Nations
in the cause of peace, should be murdered in this fashion.''
   On Saturday, Perez de Cuellar had the Obeid kidnapping. He and
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie have urged that Obeid be
freed.

<HEAD>Five Senior Cuban Officers Arrested in Drug Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reports from Cuba Monday said five senior
officers were arrested, including a former interior minister, and
five demoted one rank and retired for alleged negligence or
complicity in Cuba's drug scandal.
   Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other officers were tried for
drug smuggling and other crimes and executed July 13. Another 10
tried at the same time were sent to prison for terms ranging from
10 to 30 years.
   The latest reports indicated the Communist Party's Central
Committee, headed by by President Fidel Castro, ordered the new
crackdown.
   Dispatches from the Mexican government news agency Notimex and
Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news agency, did not say if Brig.
Gen. Jose Abrantes Fernandez, the former interior minister, and the
others arrested would be tried.
   Abrantes was dismissed as interior minister June 26, soon after
information about the drug scandal was released to the public. He
was replaced by Maj. Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra, Cuba's
third-ranking officer after Castro and his younger brother, Defense
Minister Raul Castro.
   Prensa Latina said the others arrested in the latest action were
Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez Caso, a former head of immigraton;
Oscar Carreno Gomez, former customs chief; Lt. Col. Rolando
Castaneda Izquierdo, and Hector Carbonell Mendez, director of a
state-owned company that dealt in foreign currency.
   It said Arsenio Franco Villanueva, Amado Valdez Gonzalez, Felix
Veliz Hernandez, Miguel Bermejo Labrada and Manuel Suarez Alvarez,
all brigadiers, were demoted to colonel and retired.
   The dispatches identified them as members of the Interior
Ministry, which is in charge of internal security and has its own
military force. The ministry controls all police and agencies like
customs and immigration.
   Evidence at the trial of Ochoa and the others revealed a secret
operation within the ministry to smuggle essential goods into Cuba
as a way around trade and economic sanctions imposed by the United
States in 1964.
   All were convicted of smuggling cocaine to the United States for
their own profit; dealing in contraband diamonds, ivory and rare
woods, and having links to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia.
   Ochoa, 57, claimed at the trial that he dealt in cocaine to help
Cuba's economy. The general, a comrade of Castro from the early
days of the revolution, had been decorated for leading Cuban forces
in Africa supporting Angola's Marxist government.
   The trial confirmed, as the United States had said for years,
that high-ranking Cuban officers were involved in the drug trade.
   Prensa Latina said the Communist Party ordered action against
Abrantes and the other nine for ``weakness and cronyism, which
caused serious problems to develop at the Interior Ministry.''
   It gave no details but indicated they either did not immediately
report irregularities or were negligent enough not to notice them.
   Citing official sources it did not identify, Notimex said
Abrantes and the four others arrested were charged with
``manipulating information of interest to the state, negligence in
carrying out their duties, corruption, illegal use of resources and
the unlawful appropriation of funds.''

   President Bush will appoint Juliette C.
McLennan as U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on
the Status of Women, the White House said Monday.
   Mrs. McLennan, of Washington, D.C., is a veteran of Bush's
presidential campaigns in both 1980 and 1988. She was managing
director of Blair House, the nation's official guest house for
high-ranking foreign visitors, for the State Department in
1981-1983.
   In another action, the president announced he will nominate Dan
Howard, the former Pentagon spokesman, as undersecretary of the
Navy. Howard had been assistant secretary of defense for public
affairs and had served as a White House deputy press secretary and
special assistant to the president.
   He also served in the State Department public affairs office for
the East Asian and Pacific Affairs division and in foreign postings
in Cyprus, Poland and Japan.

   Bitter accusations against the Khmer Rouge
dominated the Cambodian peace talks Monday with Vietnam calling the
radical communist group ``the most barbarous regime ever known.''
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan in turn claimed that Vietnam
plans to ``exterminate'' the Cambodian people and has no intention
of withdrawing its troops from Cambodia in September as promised.
   Diplomats from 20 countries joined in calling for a
comprehensive peace plan, but none of their speeches Sunday and
Monday offered new proposals to end the nation's two decades of
conflict.
   The conference, expected to last a month, continued behind
closed doors later Monday and immediately ran into trouble over how
to begin work, officials reported. Delegates had expressed hope for
progress in the closed sessions.
   Points of conflict included disagreement over whether a
committee should be established to hasten an end to the conflcit,
officials said. Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed government in
Cambodia contend the conflict is exclusively their affair.
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jean Gueguinou said delegates
would hold informal talks and reconvene Tuesday when committee
discussions of specific issues begin.
   Emerging as a critical point was the future role of the Khmer
Rouge, the strongest of three resistance groups fighting the
Vietnamese and the Cambodian government.
   The resistance coalition is supported by China and led by
neutralist Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who believes having the Khmer
Rouge participate in the government would be better than fighting
them in the jungles.
   Almost all delegates at the conference reviled the Khmer Rouge,
which was ousted when Vietnam invaded the country in December 1978.
The Khmer Rouge came to power in April 1975, defeating the
U.S.-backed government, and killed hundreds of thousands of
civilians in a nationwide purge.
   ``The genocidal Pol Pot regime is the most barbarous regime ever
known in human history,'' Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach told the conference.
   He said the Khmer Rouge should be ``eradicated definitively'' as
were the German Nazis after World War II. Pol Pot was the Khmer
Rouge leader during the massacres in the 1970s. He has resigned
from most of his posts.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen cautioned that excluding
any party from an interim government would be ``dangerous.''
   ``The reality in Cambodia today is the simultaneous presence of
four political parties, each possessing its own armed forces,'' he
said.
   Qian called for the Vietnamese troop withdrawal under
international supervision to be followed by a four-party interim
government headed by Sihanouk. The parties would be the present
Cambodian government and the coalition of the Khmer Rouge,
Sihanouk's followers and an anti-communist force. Japan, the West
and non-communist Southeast Asian countries agree on that approach.
Vietnam, the Soviet Union and the Cambodian government reject
inclusion of the Khmer Rouge.
   If the procedural impasse is worked out, three or four
committees will focus on specific aspects of the peace process in
closed door sesions.
   The delegates reportedly have agreed on three committees. Those
committees would discuss an ``international control mechanism'' to
monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal, work out international aspects
of the conflict and set up programs for returning refugees and
post-war reconstruction.
   Disagreements were reported over a proposed fourth committee on
an internal settlement to the conflict, over who should head the
committees and on a proposal to send a fact-finding mission to
Cambodia.
   Several conference sources said on condition of anonymity that
the Khmer Rouge were blocking agreement on a number of these points.
   ``The atmosphere in the conference room is one of optimism.
There is a strong current toward a solution,'' Sihanouk told
reporters.
   On Sunday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said: ``We know
the path to Cambodian internal reconciliation is likely to be long
and arduous. But today we take the first steps.''
   Sihanouk singled out China as the linchpin.
   ``China can do a lot. China can choose to stick with Khmer
Rouge. It is for China to decide,'' he said.
   Western sources said that while it may be impossible to
reconcile the Cambodian parties in Paris, progress could be
achieved on forming an international body to monitor the Vietnamese
pullout.
   Several ministers, including those of China, Australia and
Japan, backed a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to dispatch a ``reconnaissance mission'' to
Cambodia immediately to lay the groundwork for an ``international
control mechanism.''
   Most nations favor U.N. leadership of such a group. But the
Cambodian government and Vietnam oppose it. The United Nations gave
the country's seat at the world body to Sihanouk's coalition.

   The Bush administration indicated Monday
it did not hold Israel responsible for the reported execution of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems,
though the president's spokesman acknowledged others' concern over
Israeli actions.
   Higgins' captors said they executed him Monday in retaliation
for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   In Washington, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole suggested
Israel should have exercised more responsibility, but Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``The blame has to fall on the terrorists
themselves.''
   At the White House, officials would not directly embrace Dole's
remarks, but Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, without
elaboration, ``It is fair to say that many people do share the
senator's concerns.''
   Fitzwater said, ``We would not make any direct comment on his
statemnets other than to repeat the president's words of Friday
where he said that he did not think kidnapping and violence helps
the cause of peace.''
   Meanwhile, a senior administration official, speaking to
reporters aboard the U.S. Air Force jet that was carrying Secretary
of State James A. Baker III back to Washington from a conference in
Paris, said, ``Violence and kidnapping are not the route to peace''
in the Middle East.
   But when asked if statements both President Bush and Baker had
made deploring kidnapping were intended as criticism of Israel, the
official said, ``I am not criticizing Israel for what it did.
That's not the interpretation.''
   In any event, the official said, Bush and Baker did not want to
``deflect attention from what is the real problem here _ the
outrageous and uncivilized behavior of the people who have taken
these hostages, held them, and now by an unconfirmed report at
least, have killed a young American colonel who was engaged in a
peacekeeping mission.''
   ``I don't think we ought to divert attention from what is the
central issue, which is that, by speculating about something
else.'' said the official, who spoke only on condition that
reporters not identify him.
   Israel had offered to trade the cleric and other Shiite
prisoners for Israelis and Westerners held in Lebanon. But
President Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, said U.S. Ambassador
William Brown on Monday morning underscored to the Israelis the
U.S. position on hostage situations _ that the government will not
negotiate with terrorists.
   That communication took place before the Israelis announced
their proposal, said Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates.
   At the White House, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of
Dole's criticism of Israel, ``It is fair to say that many people do
share the senator's concerns,'' but he would not elaborate. ``We
would not make any direct comment'' on the Israeli actions, he said.
   Dole, speaking on the Senate floor in Washington, bitterly
denounced Israel for its kidnapping of the Islamic cleric.
   ``I hope the Israelis would take another look at their actions,
which they must know in advance will endanger American lives,''
Dole said. ``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of
the Israelis one of these days would be refreshing.''
   He said the Bush administration ``better have some understanding
with the Israelis about future conduct that ... endangers the lives
of Americans.''
   While Israel's motives to curb terrorism may be good, their
actions have consequences for Americans because terrorists know
``the leverage is with the United States,'' Dole said.
   An Israeli official said Obeid, under interrogation, had given
names of Higgins' kidnappers as well as details about Hezbollah's
other operations and its links to Iran.
   ``It's ridiculous to say that Israel is responsible for Higgins'
death. We don't even know if it's him, and if it is, when he was
killed,'' said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Middle East
subcommittee, said Israel had failed to consult the United States
before mounting its kidnap raid last week.
   ``We would like to see Israel bring us in. If we are going to be
in on the crash landing, we would like to be in on the takeoff as
well,'' he said.
   But Rep. Schumer said blaming Israel would be ``turning the
world on its head. Israel is among the few countries seeking to
fight terrorism.''
   Rather than criticizing Israel for the kidnapping of Obeid, the
United States and other countries should be supportive, Schumer
said. ``They're fighting the world's battle. When terrorists shoot
at you, do you just cower?''
   He defended the kidnapping, saying it did not amount to sinking
to the level of the terrorists, but constituted self defense.
   Baker, commenting as he left the conference in Paris, denounced
the ``outrageous and uncivilized behavior of Higgins' captors.''

<HEAD>Mental Patient Arraigned on Murder Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An angry mob shouted obscenities at a
mental patient charged Monday in the fatal stabbing of a 9-year-old
girl, and state officials tried to explain why he was able to walk
away from a state hospital.
   David Peterson, 37, was being held on $750,000 bond after his
Superior Court arraignment on murder and weapons charges in the
death of Jessica Short of Wallingford.
   The girl was stabbed to death in front of her mother and dozens
of other people Friday at a street fair in Middletown. The stabbing
happened after Peterson slipped away from the Connecticut Valley
Hospital, also in Middletown.
   Two police sharpshooters perched on a neighboring rooftop
provided additional security Monday while Peterson, in handcuffs
and leg shackles, was hustled in and out of court under heavy guard.
   Peterson appeared at the five-minute hearing with a public
defender, and he told Judge Robert Burns that he understood his
rights.
   Burns ordered Peterson to undergo psychiatric evaluation to
determine whether he is competent to stand trial. He is due back in
court Aug. 14.
   After the arraignment, between 35 and 40 people shouting
obscenities ran alongside the police car that took Peterson away.
Peterson was to be confined to Whiting Forensic Institute, a state
hospital for the criminally insane in Middletown.
   He could face up to life in prison if convicted of murder.
   State Mental Health Commissioner Michael F. Hogan called the
stabbing ``the most devastating event in the hospital's 100-year
history,'' but insisted that proper procedures had been followed at
Connecticut Valley Hospital.
   Hogan said Peterson was not allowed to leave the building where
he was assigned. But on Friday, Peterson apparently slipped away
from the hospital's unfenced campus and took a bus downtown.
   According to a hospital report, other patients saw him on the
bus and asked why he wasn't at the hospital. He told them he was
out on a day pass.
   Peterson bought a $37 hunting knife at a sporting goods store,
then attacked Jessica moments after she walked out of the F.W.
Woolworth store nearby, authorities said. She was stabbed
repeatedly in the face and neck.
   ``In the wake of this incident, we must conclude that tightening
security for forensic patients is necessary,'' Hogan said.
   Patients are granted privileges under a five-step program in use
for years at the hospital in this central Connecticut city 15 miles
south of Hartford.
   From now on, any changes recommended by a patient's treatment
team will be reviewed by a forensic psychiatrist, Hogan said.
   ``This system has worked well for thousands of patients over
many years and is used in many hospital, but there is no question
that it did not work in this case to prevent a horrible
occurrence,'' the commissioner said.
   Peterson was confined to the hospital last year for up to 15
years after he was found innocent by reason of insanity on assault
and burglary charges.
   Peterson's first run-in with the law came after he stabbed a
fellow student at Wethersfield High School in 1971. After that he
was in and out of state mental hospitals several times, said his
sister-in-law, Ellen Peterson.
   In 1987, Peterson was arrested again and convicted of stabbing a
man at a boarding house where he was staying.
   Funeral services for the child were scheduled for Tuesday.

   The U.N. secretary-general Monday
expressed ``outrage and revulsion'' at the reported murder of U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins who was kidnapped while leading a
U.N. organization in Lebanon.
   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar also said President Bush
asked him to help with the return of Higgens' body.
   Perez de Cuellar said he had ``many sources'' to help him comply
with the request but he still was seeking verification of Higgins'
murder.
   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that
``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and
abduction.'' The 15-member council also demanded the immediate,
safe release of all captives ``wherever and by whomever they are
being held.''
   In another action the council routinely extended for six months
the mandate of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL. The
peacekeeping force is stationed in southern Lebanon where Higgins
was kidnapped by Moslem extremists.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, speaking after the
council meeting, said of the reports that Higgins had been
murdered: ``I have been told it could be him (Higgins) because in a
videotape (of the purported hanging) ... there are indications it
is very much like him.''
   He said he planned to meet Higgins' wife, Marine Maj. Robin
Higgins, on Tuesday, but gave no details.
   Reports had circulated last year that Higgins had been killed by
his captors.
   On Monday, while still in Paris for a conference on Cambodia,
Perez de Cuellar spoke with two Iranian envoys and appealed to them
to ``use their influence to avoid this crime.''
   The secretary-general has appealed for Higgins' release but he
also expressed ``outrage and revulsion at the (reported) fact that
an innocent man, serving the United Nations in the cause of peace,
should be murdered in this fashion.''
   Higgins was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, near Tyre, by pro-Iranian
fundamentalists while heading the 75-member U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization working in Lebanon. His abductors claimed he was a spy
for the CIA.
   Higgins' captors threatened to execute him Monday unless Israel
released Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric believed
linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group. The cleric was abducted
by Israeli commandos Friday and Israel has proposed trading him for
other hostages, including three Israeli soldiers.
   Perez de Cuellar on Saturday deplored the Obeid kidnapping and
called for his release.
   Security Council President Dragoslav Pejic, ambassador of
Yugoslavia, told the council that it met ``under the shadow of
cruel reports that Lt. Col. Higgins who serves the United Nations
on a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon may have been murdered today.''
   The council, he said, urges the parties involved ``to act within
reason, restraint and proper respect for human life and dignity.''
   The resolution adopted Monday was the culmination of several
months of discussion and the council president called it ``a most
tragic irony that our efforts ... should have coincided with the
grave events of recent days.''
   On July 29, 1988, the Security Council specifically condemned
the kidnapping of Higgins and demanded his release. It called upon
U.N. members to exert their influence to secure his release.

<HEAD>Union Blames Chinese Government in Delaware Dispute</HEAD>

   The United Steelworkers Union holds the
Chinese government responsible for alleged unfair hiring at the
nation's oldest steelmaker, union President Lynn Williams said
Monday as he led a rally at the Chinese Embassy.
   Williams opened the international union's annual legislative
conference with a speech, then picked up a bullhorn and led 750
steelworkers to the embassy during the evening rush hour to protest
hiring actions at the former Phoenix Steel Co. of Claymont, Del.
   China International Trust and Investment Corp., a Beijing-based
arm of the Chinese government, bought the shut-down plant last year
and named it CitiSteel USA. It was CITIC's first U.S. manufacturing
venture.
   The steelworkers' union initially welcomed the takeover, but now
claims the new owners reneged on a commitment to hire former
Phoenix Steel workers.
   Of the 250 former Phoenix workers who applied for jobs,
CitiSteel hired 38 of them for skilled positions, the union said.
It said in a statement that the firm did not hire Phoenix employees
``for the less skilled jobs that make up the majority of jobs in
the plant.''
   The National Labor Relations Board is investigating the
steelworkers' complaint that CitiSteel has refused collective
bargaining with the union, and has refused to hire people because
they are union members.
   Like the June army massacre of students and other pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing, the CitiSteel case is an example of
Chinese government ``ruthlessness,'' Williams said in an interview.
   ``It is clear that the Chinese government in the end is
responsible. CITIC is their corporation,'' Williams said.
   ``People's opportunities have been taken away from them. They've
denied employment to people who have given their lives to the
predecessor company and to building the steel mill,'' he said.
   In a news release, CitiSteel acknowledged the protest but said
the union had ``incorrectly'' claimed that the company was obliged
to hire former Phoenix employees.
   CitiSteel said it needed ``flexibility'' in shaping its work
force. Nevertheless, it said 60 percent of its skilled hourly
workers had been employed by Phoenix, and that it would recruit
others for unskilled jobs.

<HEAD>Washington Post Employees to Vote on Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper guild employees at The Washington
Post who have been without a contract for three years will vote
Wednesday on an agreement that would raise salaries an average of
$165 a week over five years, a union official said Monday.
   Sandi Polaski, chief negotiator for the Washington-Baltimore
Newspaper Guild Local 31, said the guild's bargaining committee was
recommending approval by the 1,420 newsroom and other white collar
employees covered by the pact.
   ``It's not everything we wanted,'' Polaski said, but it contains
``substantial improvements'' in wages and guild representation.
   The tentative agreement was reached Friday following all-night
talks. The previous contract expired three years ago and Post
management had declared an impasse two years ago. Post reporters
resorted to two byline strikes on the anniversaries of the expired
pact.
   In addition to newsroom workers, the contract covers employees
in the accounting, advertising, circulation and data-processing and
other business departments of the Post's 3,000-member workforce.
   The new contract would raise salaries between 4 percent and 6
percent a year, with lower-paid workers receiving a higher
percentage increase along with improvements in minimum salary
scales.
   Employees who make more than $50,000 a year, which includes most
of the paper's reporters, will get average raises of $42.50 a week
during each of the first three years of the contract, with similar
raises expected in the final two years.
   The pact also calls for improvements in the Post's pension and
disability-insurance plans, and better medical and dental coverage,
but at higher cost to employees.
   The additional salary and pension provisions will cost the
company about $15 million over the life of the contract, according
to Frank Havlicek, the newspaper's chief negotiator.
   The agreement also contains provisions for resolving
worker-management disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.

<HEAD>FDA Asked Not to Let Promethazine Hydrochloride Go Over-the-Counter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory committee on Monday recommended
that the Food and Drug Administration reverse plans to allow
nonprescription sales of a cough-cold drug because of its possible
association with sudden infant death syndrome.
   The agency had planned to allow over-the-counter sales of the
drug, promethazine hydrochloride, in multi-ingredient cold products
for short-term use.
   But the FDA asked its Pulmonary Drugs Advisory Committee to
review the issue in light of a petition from the Public Citizen
Health Research Group and the University of Maryland Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome Institute.
   The groups said the drug, which has been sold in prescription
products since 1951, may contribute to some cases of the syndrome
known as SIDS. Though it is not recommended for use in young
children, doctors do prescribe it for them, for colic, the groups
said.
   The advisory committee voted 7-1 to recommend that the drug
remain a prescription ingredient, said Susan Cruzan, an FDA
spokeswoman.
   She said committee members were concerned about a possible
relationship between the drug and SIDS and that more study was
needed to prove conclusively whether the drug plays a role in the
syndrome.
   The panel was also concerned about possible brain damage from
the drug.
   ``The FDA will consider the committee's recommendation,'' she
said. ``The FDA has to decide what the next step is.''
   The drug is an active ingredient in products sold under the
trade name Phenergan, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia. Wyeth-Ayerst and other makers of prescription
products using the drug agreed to withhold nonprescription
marketing pending review by the advisory committee.
   The health group and SIDS institute said that although Phenergan
is not recommended for children under 2 years old, doctors wrote
175,000 prescriptions for the drug for that age group in 1985.
   The groups feared the drug would become even more widely used in
children if it were sold over the counter, even though it would be
labeled for use only by adults and children over 6.

<HEAD>Audit Hits Size, Cost of Mailing Report on Super Collider</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lot of people have asked, Just what was the
Energy Department thinking of when it spent $344,000 mailing a
26-pound report on the super collider to 16,800 people?
   It wasn't money, but rather a take-no-chances-attitude,
congressional auditors reported Monday.
   ``Cost was not the primary constraint considered. Other
priorities such as the desire to demonstrate full compliance with
the regulations, avoid public criticism or lawsuits, and the desire
to meet its ... timetable represented overriding considerations,''
the audit concluded.
   ``An overriding factor ... was to err on the side of least
risk.''
   The super collider report, which analyzed the environmental
impact of the $4.4 billion atom smasher, was sent to governors,
reporters, school children, libraries, property owners _ nearly
anyone who had written the department about the project, signed a
petition or even an attendance sheet at public meetings.
   ``I'm sure most of them ended up in the trash,'' said Rep.
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., ``or at least holding up the Christmas
tree, or doing something.''
   Hastert asked the General Accounting Office to determine if the
large mailing was necessary to comply with federal rules on
environmental reports.
   The GAO suggested the Energy Department could have saved more
than $200,000 in mailing costs and prevented a lot of sore backs if
it had trimmed the 8,000-page document, limited the distribution
and picked a cheaper form of delivery.
   Energy Department spokesman Jeff Sherwood did not return phone
calls requesting comment.
   The report, which cost $1.36 million to print, bind and mail, is
an environmental impact statement on possible sites for the super
collider in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.
   The super collider is a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets
which would whip proton beams together with 20 times the force of
the most powerful exisiting atom smasher.
   Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from
studying subatomic particles created by the proton collisions.
Texas was awarded the project last November.
   Hastert, whose district was considered for the super collider,
said constituents started complaining nine days before Christmas
when about half of the 16,000 reports sent around the country
started arriving in suburban Chicago.
   ``One morning I received a panicked call from the postmaster in
St. Charles, Illinois, and he virtually had truckloads of this
thing,'' the congressman said. ``He had to rent a U-Haul and hire
two people to get them around.''

<TEXT>
   Edgar Kaufmann jr., a department store heir and
architectural scholar who played a crucial role in the creation of
Frank Lloyd Wright's ``Fallingwater,'' died of leukemia Monday. He
was 79.
   Kaufmann died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
according to Victoria Newhouse, a fellow editor of the
Architectural History Foundation of New York.
   Kaufmann studied with Wright in 1934. He is generally credited
with introducing Wright to his father, Edgar, a Pittsburgh
department store magnate who wanted to build a summer home on land
he had acquired in southwestern Pennsylvania.
   Completed in 1936, Fallingwater is considered one of Wright's
greatest architectural designs. Its cantilever construction,
anchored in mountain rock, makes the graceful stone and white
concrete house appear to be soaring over Bear Run, a cascading
stream near Ohiopyle in Fayette County.
   In a poll several years ago by the American Institute of
Architects' Forum, the house was named the greatest example of
American architectural design.
   The elder Kaufmann died in 1956, leaving the house to his son,
who used it as a summer house until 1963, when he donated the house
and 1,500 surrounding acres to the Western Pennsylvania
Conservancy. More than 120,000 people visited the house last year,
according to Tom Schmidt, director of Fallingwater.
   Kaufmann ``felt Fallingwater was too great a work of art just to
be possessed by a single person,'' Schmidt said.
   ``It's the only great Wright residence that came into the public
domain with the furniture, surrounding land and the art collection
intact,'' Schmidt said.
   Kaufmann became a leading Wright scholar, as well as a curator
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and an adjunct
professor of architectural history at Columbia University. He also
was a financial supporter of, and editor at, the Architectural
History Foundation, which publishes scholarly books.
   His own book, ``Fallingwater: An American Country House,'' was
published in 1986 and is now in its tenth printing.
   Colleagues said Kaufmann insisted that the ``junior'' at the end
of his name be written with a lower-case ``j.''
   Kaufmann had no survivors and no funeral service was scheduled,
according to Mrs. Newhouse. Schmidt said a memorial service would
be held at Fallingwater next week.

   Rescue divers lost their fight with time and
hurricane seas Monday and had to give up their search for 10
offshore oil workers missing in a capsized rig in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   ``As soon as possible we will have people back on the scene, but
there is no way to do anything with the conditions out there,''
said Coast Guard Lt. Pat Philbin.
   The rescuers were stymied by 12-foot seas, heavy rains and
60-mph winds on the fringes of tropical storm Chantal, which was
upgraded to hurricane status Monday evening.
   Officials refused to speculate on the chances of survival for
those who may have found air pockets in the capsized rig, lying on
its side in about 25 feet of water, Philbin said.
   The Chevron-leased rig was headed to shore early Monday to
escape the storm when it capsized about 20 miles off the Louisiana
coast near Morgan City, said company spokesman Jonathan Lifa.
   Four of the 14 workers aboard were plucked from the water by
fishermen and a Coast Guard helicopter, said Chief Petty Officer
Michael Robling.
   An air bubble trapped in watertight compartments would be the
only oxygen for any survivors, said Lt. Steve Hardy, but he did not
estimate how long any trapped crewmen could survive.
   Divers were unable to search the rig because of the storm, he
said. The dive boat and a Coast Guard cutter stood nearby, but the
bad weather forced helicopters back to shore.
   Three survivors were taken aboard the fishing vessel Spar Royale
for a trip to Wine Island Pass, and one person was taken by
helicopter to Grand Isle, Hardy said. None of the four was
seriously injured, officials said.
   The Coast Guard, said the rig, a 72-foot self-propelled barge
with jack-up legs, was owned by Avis Boug Co. of Folsom and leased
by Chevron Oil Corp.
   The Coast Guard recently began inspections of such vessels
because of the ``significant casualty rate'' and Monday was the
deadline for applying for an inspection. This company had applied,
Lifa said.
   The barge had been in 50 to 60 feet of water, working on oil
pipes on the seabottom. The rig's legs, which extend 100 feet down
when when it is working, are lifted above the vessel when it is
underway, Hardy said.
   Elsewhere, a worker on a Chevron platform in the Gulf south of
New Orleans died Monday after he fell into the water while trying
to board a crew boat, but five other workers safely evacuated a
dangerously tilted jackup rig off Grand Isle.
   The jackup rig, owned by Atlantic &amp; Pacific Marine Inc. of
Houston, was listing at a 12 degree angle at 5 p.m. Monday.
``That's a pretty good angle. I'd say it's going over,'' Hardy said.

   The four major American television networks
showed videotape Monday purportedly of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
hanging from a gallows, though one used only freeze-frames of the
grisly image.
   Cable News Network and CBS showed the video on afternoon
newscasts, while ABC and NBC broadcast still pictures from the
tape. NBC later showed the videotape on ``NBC Nightly News.''
   ``It is not gratuitous violence,'' said Steve Haworth, spokesman
for CNN. He said editors considered, ``Is this stark video
necessary to tell the story? And in fact it is. Everybody came to
the same conclusion.''
   CNN Anchor Ralph Wenge warned viewers the tape was ``very
graphic.''
   On NBC, afternoon viewers of special reports and short ``news
digests'' saw still frames of the man's head and torso.
   ``We felt that the picture we showed captured the essence of
what was claimed to be happening,'' said Donald Browne, executive
director of NBC News.
   Browne said the network showed only still pictures initially
because it had had little time to study the full video and because
viewers do not expect to see something so graphic when regular
programming is interrupted.
   It went ahead with the video in the evening because ``people
expect in a story like that to see graphic material,'' he said.
   The network sent the full tape to affiliates, should they decide
to use more, he said.
   For a special report on ABC during the day, ``There was an
editorial decision not to show the videotape, just the still,''
said spokesman Scott Richardson.
   ABC's evening newscast again only showed still pictures because,
as news anchor Peter Jennings told viewers, the only difference was
that the video ``shows that Col. Higgins was swinging on his
makeshift gallows when the tape was made.''
   ``Our view of showing it is simply based on a gut reaction _ no
need for us to help demean Col. Higgins by watching him swing,'' he
added.

   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered east of the Mississippi
River on Monday, and Hurricane Chantal headed toward shore with
heavier rain and high wind.
   The center of the hurricane was expected to hit land Tuesday,
and hurricane warnings were posted for the upper Texas and
Louisiana Gulf coasts, from Freeport, Texas, to Morgan City, La.
   Widespread rain and thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast
into northwestern Florida were associated with the first band of
thunderstorms spiraling outward from Chantal.
   Isolated tornadoes and rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were
possible from eastern Texas through Louisiana into southern
Mississippi during Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Oil rigs along the Louisiana coast reported wind gusting to 50
mph.
   Squalls on the edge of the storm dumped heavy rain on New
Orleans and forced closure of the 24-mile long causeway across Lake
Pontchartrain.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the lower
Mississippi into the lower Ohio valleys. Thunderstorms also
developed from Georgia into the Carolinas and Virginia.
   Elsewhere, a cold front curved over the Pacific Ocean off the
northern Pacific Coast, and showers moved into coastal regions of
Oregon and extreme northern California.
   Bakersfield, Calif., tied its record low for the date of 60
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 107 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Monday's low in the Lower 48 states was 39 at Houlton, Maine, and
Burns, Ore.
   For Tuesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from southern and eastern parts of Texas through the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys and the Gulf Coast states to the
southern Atlantic Coast. Scattered showers were forecast across the
Pacific Northwest. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms were
forecast from the Colorado Rockies into northern Arizona and New
Mexico, and over parts of southern New England.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the central and northern
Pacific Coast region, and from parts of the northern Great Lakes
into New England; between 100 and 115 across the desert Southwest;
and in the 80s or 90s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Cars jammed the coastal highway leading
south from Beirut as thousands more residents fled Monday to escape
shelling duels between Christians and Syrians that killed eight
people and wounded 92 overnight.
   ``I'm not going to return unless it's all over this time,'' said
Samiha Rashdan, a Sunni Moslem leaving with her husband and three
teen-age sons. ``We returned from south Lebanon last week only to
get caught in the new mad shelling.''
   Mattresses, beds and other household goods balanced high on the
roofs of many cars, indicating residents do not plan early returns.
   Police estimated only 200,000 of the city's 1.5 million
inhabitants remain in the capital. The rest have fled since Syrian
troops based in Lebanon started battling Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly
Christian troops on March 8.
   Since then, 510 people have been killed and 2,158 wounded.
   Late Monday, a car bomb exploded in Moslem west Beirut, police
said. There were no injuries after the black Mercedes-Benz, loaded
with 88 pounds of TNT and parked near a highway intersection,
exploded and burst into flames, they said.
   A short time later, heavy gunfire broke out around Beirut's
central prison, about one mile from the car bomb. But police said
they could not immediately determine what caused the shooting.
   Police said the overnight battle that rained shells on nearly
every neighborhood of the divided city was one of the worst in
Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   ``It looks like both sides are bent on destroying Beirut. This
is a scorched-earth bombardment rarely matched in previous civil
war rounds,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing regulations.
   Two hospitals in Christian east Beirut as well as the Turkish
Embassy and the Belgian ambassador's residence near Aoun's palace
took direct hits in the bombardment from 5 p.m. Sunday to 4 a.m.
Monday, said the spokesman. No casualties were reported there.
   The presidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut, was
battered with sustained barrages from BM-21 Syrian launchers that
spew 40 rockets a minute. Aoun, 54, lives in the palace bunker and
was not hurt, the spokesman said.
   Christian gunners struck back with savage barrages from 155mm
howitzers that set three gas stations ablaze in different
residential areas of Moslem west Beirut.
   ``The burning stations spewed balls of flames like firecrackers
on nearby apartment buildings, forcing residents to flee, even from
basements,'' the spokesman said.
   Hundreds of stores and cars were gutted. Streets were carpeted
with glass shards and debris. Broken electric power poles
barricaded alleyways. Traffic was scarce.
   Among the wounded were six members of a Sunni Moslem family
whose sixth floor apartment was struck by a 155mm shell.
   ``We were all injured,'' said Issam Ramadan, 30.
   His 9-month-old daughter Leila started bleeding badly. ``I had
to carry her in my arms and run for about two miles to the American
University hospital with shells exploding around me,'' he said.
   Hospital officials said the baby was recovering well after her
head and facial wounds were stitched. Other family members were
discharged.
   West Beirut residents, meanwhile, observed a strike to protest
Israel's abduction Friday of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite
Moslem cleric in south Lebanon. The strike was ignored in the
capital's eastern Christian sector as residents packed groceries,
butcher shops and bakeries to lay in food supplies.
   Prosecutor General Joseph Freiha said Monday that Aoun has
ordered a court-martial of those responsible for a report by the
privately owned Akhbar Lubanan news agency that his troops have
acquired surface-to-surface Frog missiles from Iraq.
   The agency is accused of distributing ``a false statement''
quoting Lebanon's ambassador to Baghdad, Hikmat Awad.
   The report, which said the arms are intended to boost Aoun's
battle to chase the Syrian troops from Lebanon, was published by
several Beirut newspapers Sunday.
   The Frog-7 has a range of more than 40 miles and its warhead of
1,210 pounds of high explosives could hit the Syrian capital,
Damascus, if fired from the central Lebanese mountains in the
Christian heartland.
   Iraq and Syria are traditional rivals in the Arab world and
Iraqi President Sadam Hussein is arming Aoun's 20,000 troops, far
outnumbered by the 40,000 Syrian troops which first came to Lebanon
in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

   The Army was called out Monday to help battle fires raging out
of control on thousands of acres in the West, and crews set a
1,000-acre backfire in an attempt to halt a California blaze that
destroyed seven homes.
   National Guardsmen already were on duty in Idaho and Oregon.
   Residents were allowed to return to Lowman, Idaho, a small
resort town that was largely destroyed by a firestorm that had
charred 10,000 acres.
   ``My husband left in shorts and no shirt,'' said 70-year-old
Daisy Oliver, whose mobile home at Lowman was reduced to blackened
metal scrap. ``We didn't get anything, just what we had on our
backs. ... I don't know where we'll go from here.''
   Hundreds of fires, most started by lightning last week, had
blackened more than 110,000 acres in five states since Wednesday.
   The weather improved in Oregon with lower wind and temperatures
and a forecast of scattered showers, but firefighters in hard-hit
Idaho faced temperatures in the 90s, low humidity and wind gusting
to 30 mph.
   ``We're in for a long haul,'' said Dave Olson of the Payette
National Forest where more 200 fires burned in central Idaho.
``It's getting serious, and it's getting tough to deal with these
fires.''
   More than 9,700 firefighters manned the lines on the two dozen
biggest blazes in Idaho, California, and Oregon. Washington state
had an 850-acre fire and Montana had several small fires.
   That meant manpower in the West was almost completely mobilized,
and managers at the Boise (Idaho) Interagency Fire Center, the
nation's fire command post, called on the Army and crews from other
regions for help.
   Hundreds of firefighters were being flown to the command center
from Alaska, the East, Southeast and Southwest, spokesman Ron Smith
said. And soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., were sent to Boise for
training before being sent to the fire lines.
   Firefighters set off a 1,000-acre backfire Monday near Auberry,
Calif., in an effort to tame the last section of an arson fire that
burned seven homes in the central Sierra Nevada and forced
evacuation of 2,500 people.
   There were nearly 2,000 personnel at the 11,350-acre blaze,
dubbed the Powerhouse fire, said U.S. Forest spokeswoman Margie
Clack.
   Residents of Auberry, some 30 miles east of Fresno, were allowed
to return home Sunday but people who live closer to active parts of
the fire were told to remain away at least one more day.
   ``We're not letting folks back in homes in those areas due to
the intense buildup of smoke in the area and for public safety
since there is lots of firefighting equipment moving on those
roads,'' Clack said.
   Residents began to return Monday to Lowman, Idaho, about 70
miles northeast of Boise.
   Twenty-five structures in the town, which has a year-round
population of about 15 but which attracts summer visitors from
Boise, were destroyed late Saturday and early Sunday by the Lowman
Complex fire.
   Due north in the Payette National Forest, crews had prepared the
mining hamlet of Warren and its 25 residents against possible
attack by the 4,200-acre Steamboat Complex of three fires.
   ``There are engines in place. There are pumps, hoses, foam units
in place. Everything that can be done has been done,'' said Payette
spokesman Olson.
   The Lowman Complex _ a system of three major fires in the Boise
National Forest _ was the worst of hundreds of blazes burning on
40,000 acres of timber and range in western and central Idaho, and
new fires blew up on nearly 4,000 acres in the Hell's Canyon area
on the Oregon border.
   Some 4,000 firefighters, backed up by Idaho National Guardsmen
ferrying supplies and guarding against potential looting, focused
on 10 of the largest fires.
   The Lowman Complex was a virtual firestorm, generating cyclonic
wind that witnesses said snapped some trees in half, said
spokeswoman Pat Entwistle.
   A morning air inversion aggravated by dense smoke finally lifted
enough to get retardant tanker planes back in action.
   At least five major fires and several smaller ones burned out of
control Monday in eastern Oregon. Last Wednesday's thunderstorms
produced about 7,800 lightning strikes in the region.
   About 30 ranching families who fled their homes and turned
livestock loose in the face of a fire were allowed to return home
Monday in a rural area south of Baker, in northeastern Oregon.
However, about 10 families from a subdivision south of Baker
remained evacuated as the Dooley Mountain fire grew to about 17,000
acres, said Gay Brockus of the U.S. Forest Service.
   Fire coordinators focused on the Dooley Mountain fire _ biggest
in the state _ and about 20 miles northeast, where the Canal Creek
Fire grew to 8,000 acres after moving out of the Eagle Cap
Wilderness onto private timberland.
   ``You look out the window here and there's columns of smoke in
every direction,'' said Kathy Aplin, a spokeswoman for the Oregon
Department of Forestry in Baker.
   About 1,200 firefighters battled a series of 23 fires that
charred 8,630 acres in the Glacier Complex on the Malheur National
Forest 22 miles east of John Day in east-central Oregon, said
spokeswoman Barbara Kennedy.
   In Southern California, a 5,845-acre fire in the Cleveland
National Forest east of San Diego remained out of control Monday
but a 1,200-acre brush fire northwest of Los Angeles, which earlier
forced 100 people to evacuate, was controlled.
   About 1,270 firefighters had the Cleveland blaze about 55
percent surrounded, but U.S. Forest Service spokesman Chris Cundari
said there was no estimate on when the fire straddling San Diego
and Riverside counties would be fully contained.
   Firefighters also extinguished a stubborn 10,500-acre fire near
Atascadero that had burned since late last week.

   The army said Monday that a Moslem cleric
seized last week by Israeli commandos in Lebanon has acknowledged
personal involvement in the abduction of Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins.
   It said Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid had revealed the names of
Higgins' captors, who reported they hanged the U.S. Marine officer
Monday.
   An army spokesman said: ``From first evidence from a continuing
investigation of Obeid and according to his confessions in the
investigation, it was revealed that the sheik was personally
involved in planning and guiding and aiding the following terrorist
acts:
   ``The kidnapping of two Israeli army soldiers, Rachamim Alsheikh
and Yosef Fink in February 1986; carrying out terror acts against
Israeli forces, and the kidnapping of Col. Higgins and his transfer
to Beirut and the hiding of his kidnappers in his home in Jibchit.''
   During the investigation, Obeid ``revealed the names of the
kidnappers and more details on the terrorist acts of the Hezbollah
organization and its connection with Iran. The investigation
continues,'' said the spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping
with standing regulations.
   A year-old interview was broadcast on Israel Television in which
Obeid supported the kidnapping of Higgins, claiming he was a CIA
agent who spied on the pro-Iranian Hezbollah. Obeid is a spiritual
leader of Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
the killing of Higgins was ``odious and criminal'' if true, but
Israel remains ready to trade prisoners for Israeli and other
hostages.
   ``At this point we have no confirmation that, indeed, Col.
Higgins was murdered,'' he said after Higgins' captors announced
they hanged him Monday.
   They had threatened to kill Higgins at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT)
unless Israel freed Obeid, who was abducted Friday. Higgins was
kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.
   About an hour after the deadline, the group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth announced it had killed
Higgins and released a videotape showing a body hanging from a
gallows.
   ``We have to be very cautious with a possible reaction, because
you remember a year ago the same organization said that they
executed Col. Higgins after the accidental shooting down of an
Iranian airplane by the U.S. Navy,'' Pazner said.
   ``So we will have to look for further evidence to confirm
whether such an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated.''
   On Dec. 12, 1988, Higgins' captors said he had been sentenced to
death, but did not say he had been killed. A diplomatic source told
The Associated Press the United Nations had unconfirmed reports
that he was killed after the USS Vincennes, on duty in the Persian
Gulf, shot down an Iranian jetliner July 3, 1988.
   Israel Television's Arab affairs analyst, Ehud Yaari, said
Israeli and other intelligence services, and U.N. officials, had
received many reports recently indicating Higgins was killed in
July 1988 or in December 1988.
   The military often allows Yaari interview guerrillas captured in
Lebanon or at sea.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens also reacted cautiously to reports
Higgins had been hanged.
   ``We have no proof,'' he said on Israel radio. ``This
information is from a fanatical organization which is not known for
telling the truth. To our great sorrow, we are well acquainted with
this organization.''
   Pazner said Israel was holding open its offer to exchange its
Shiite Moslem captives from Lebanon for Israeli prisoners of war
and all foreign hostages held by Shiite groups.
   ``The offer stands because we are aware of the precarious
position of foreign hostages in Lebanon and we are ready to do our
share if it is possible to liberate them,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin made the offer earlier in the
day, before the reports that Higgins had been killed.
   ``Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeli and other
hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon, Rabin said. ``Israel is
offering to trade prisoners, detainees and hostages.''
   ``According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners and
foreign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swapped
for all the Shiite prisoners kept by Israel, including Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others,'' Rabin said.
   Israel accuses Obeid of planning attacks on its forces in south
Lebanon. Kasfi was captured in Lebanon in December.
   Security sources in Lebanon estimate 50-60 Lebanese Shiites are
in Israeli prisons.
   Israel's surrogate militia, the South Lebanon Army, holds about
300 Shiites in a prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. The militia
helps patrol Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' just north
of the border.
   In offering the prisoner exchange, Rabin said including hostages
of other countries in the deal ``results from the fact that they're
also threatened by the Israeli actions.''
   The 17 Westerners missing and presumed held hostage in Lebanon,
all or most of them by kidnappers loyal to Iran, include Higgins
and eight other Americans.

<HEAD>Indians, State Reach Tentative Accord To Ease Reservation Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Mohawk leaders and state police agreed
Monday to ease a tense, 10-day-old standoff at the blockaded St.
Regis Indian Reservation, and a leader of the Mohawk warrior
society was released on bail, officials said.
   More than 200 state troopers have blocked roads to keep
outsiders off Indian land since a July 20 raid by 225 state police
and FBI agents on the reservation's illegal casinos.
   Five Mohawk leaders met with state police, members of Gov. Mario
Cuomo's staff and a U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs agent to resolve
tensions on the reservation, which straddles the St. Lawrence River
on the U.S.-Canadian border.
   ``We have reached a tentative agreement which assures everyone's
safety,'' said Mohawk Chief Harold Tarbell.
   State police began removing some of their concrete roadblocks
Monday night, said state trooper Richard Garcia.
   ``We will be scaling down the checkpoints and allowing the
motoring public onto the reservation,'' he said. ``We're hopeful
this will ease the tension.''
   Garcia said state police would post informational barricades for
an indefinite period, to explain the situation on the reservation
to motorists, giving them the option to enter the Indian land or
turn back, he said.
   ``The casinos are still closed. I'm personally hoping they will
stay closed because of their illegal nature,'' Tarbell said. Mohawk
leaders have scheduled a mid-August vote on whether reservation
residents want to legalize gambling.
   Also Monday, Art Montour, 47, a leader of the Mohawk Sovereign
Security Force, was freed on $50,000 bail after a week in jail,
charged with obstructing justice during the July 20 raid.
   Montour, accused of using a gun to keep police from searching a
casino during the raid, was released in Syracuse after posting
$5,000. He was to appear again in court Aug. 16.
   Gambling has divided the Mohawks. After two raids in the past
two months, the reservation's warrior faction protested, claiming
police have no jurisdiction on Mohawk land and that the raids
violated their sovereignty.
   Montour's allies erected blockades on state Route 37 inside the
reservation, state police barricaded the road to keep outsiders out.
   Eleven people were injured July 24, when about 75 Mohawks
stepped off the reservation and tried to prevent Montour's arrest
when state police moved in.

<TEXT>
   A three-member Arab League committee on
Lebanon announced early Tuesday it had reached an impasse in its
efforts to find a solution to that country's 14-year-old civil war.
   The announcement came less than half way through the committee's
six-month mission.
   ``The committee judges with regret that its mission has reached
an impasse in the security and political spheres,'' the committee
said in a statement carried by Algeria's official APS news agency.
   Committee leaders are Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, Saudi
Arabian King Fahd and Moroccan King Hassan II. The committee was
formed May 26 at the Arab summit meeting in Casablanca, Morocco, to
find a solution to the Lebanese crisis.
   Algerian television, citing the communique, said the commission
would turn over its results to the other Arab League heads of state.
   The television ran the videotape of the reported execution of
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins by his pro-Iranian captors
in Lebanon as it announced the committee's statement.
   It was not clear if the statement meant the committee would try
to overcome the impasse or was calling an end to its mission.

<TEXT>
   A woman who survived the sinking of a
sailboat and 14 days on a life raft in the Atlantic Ocean is alert,
stable and expected to recover fully, a hospital official said
Monday.
   Her sailing partner Nicholas Abbott, who lived on the 37-foot
Anaulis at the Harlem Yacht Club, is presumed drowned, said Coast
Guard Lt. J.G. Matthew Wannamaker.
   Abbott, 50, and Janet Culver, 48, of Passaic, N.J., went on the
cruise to decide whether they would marry, said the survivor's
mother, Hannah Culver of East Quogue on Long Island.
   Her daughter was rescued from an inflatable dinghy by the U.S.
research vessel Jeronimo Sunday morning 450 miles southeast of New
York, or about halfway between the city and Bermuda, Wannamaker
said.
   She was transferred to the Royal Viking Star, a cruise ship in
the vicinity, for treatment by the ship's doctor, according to
Capt. Jacob Lothe, the vessel's skipper.
   ``She was smiling but she looked very tired,'' he said after the
boat docked Monday in Hamilton. ``She was dehydrated and her face
was burned and puffy.''
   Ms. Culver arrived at King Edward VII Memorial Hospital
suffering from dehydration and exposure, said Hume Martin, the
hospital's executive director.
   ``She was started on intravenous and oral feedings and is under
treatment for skin injuries which have resulted from her exposure
to sun and sea water,'' he said.
   ``She is currently stable, remains alert, and it is strongly
anticipated that she will make a complete recovery.''
   He said Ms. Culver, a legal secretary in Hackensack, N.J., was
not ready to comment on her ordeal.
   The sailboat carrying Abbott and Ms. Culver sank on July 16,
Wannamaker said. The Coast Guard had been searching for the pair
since July 23 and had alerted vessels in the area to watch for them.
   In New York, the Coast Guard issued a report based on
information Ms. Culver gave authorities in Bermuda. It said the
sailboat sank after packing material, used to keep water from
seeping in around the shaft, blew out into the water when the shaft
was engaged.
   Ms. Culver told officials she and Abbott fled onto the dinghy
with nothing more than a flashlight, a flotation device, a handheld
FM radio, some cold cuts, crackers, peanuts and a half-gallon of
water. They supplemented the food with fish, according to the
report.
   Ms. Culver told authorities that Abbott, apparently suffering
from exhaustion and fatigue, climbed out of the four-person raft on
Wednesday without a life jacket, according to Wannkamaker.
   ``He seemed disillusioned, maybe even slightly deranged,
according to Ms. Culver,'' Wannamaker said.
   Abott reportedly told Ms. Culver, ``I'm going for a swim, I
don't know if I'm coming back.''
   When he got about 100 feet away, Ms. Culver heard him make
choking noises, saw him with his head down in the water and his
back and shoulders floating. He then drifted away.
   The search for Abbott was suspended Sunday.
   Hannah Culver said the trip was the first major sailing venture
for her daughter, who had sailed only on inlet waters off Long
Island.
   She said Abbott had asked her daughter to marry him, but she did
not want to agree until she determined whether she liked long
sailing trips.
   ``She wasn't sure she could survive sailing. She gets seasick.
She said, `If I can't take it, I don't want to hold him back,'''
Hannah Culver recalled.
   ``I can't believe she was 14 days on that raft. How did she
live?'' she asked.
   Although Abbott was from New Jersey, he lived during the summer
on his boat at the Harlem Yacht Club and contracted privately to
transport pleasure yachts, said club officer Stephen Lippe. He also
worked in Bogota, N.J., delivering packages for Lippe's Econo
Courier service.
   Abbott was a ``very good sailor,'' Lippe said. ``I call him top
grade, very experienced, very skilled. He knew celestial navigation
... and he did trips like this three or four times a year.''
   Wannamaker said the Coast Guard had not determined what caused
the sailboat to sink. There were no major storms in the area where
it went down, Lt. Mike Fijalka said.

<TEXT>
   Scientist Carl Sagan urged the nation's governors
Monday to support measures that counter the environmental threats
of ozone depletion and global warming.
   ``We are, to put it simply, in danger of fouling the nest,''
Sagan said.
   Sagan, addressing a committee on the environment of the National
Governors' Association, said potential damage to Earth and the
environment is too great to delay taking steps to reduce pollution
and destruction of trees caused by global warming.
   He said that if unchecked, projected increases in the Earth's
temperature due to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other
gases in the atmosphere would lead to drought, creation of new
deserts, and an increase in water levels that would innundate
coastal areas.
   ``It is a problem that's extremely serious and will not be
solved by business as usual,'' said Sagan, an astronomy professor
at Cornell University who has gained fame through his books and
public television series.
   He spoke as the the governors of New York, New Jersey and
Vermont released a report urging steps to combat the environmental
threat posed by global warming.
   Democrats Mario Cuomo of New York and Madeleine Kunin of
Vermont, and Republican Thomas Kean of New Jersey, presented the
report to their fellow governors at the National Governors'
Association annual meeting.
   The report, written following a conference sponsored last March
by the three governors, recommends a 20 percent reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2000. It also recommends elimination
of chlorofluorocarbon production and use, and improvement of fuel
economy of new cars to at least 42 miles per gallon, by that date.
   Kean said scientists are in agreement on steps needed to avoid
the consequences of atmospheric changes due to pollution and said
governors must help turn a ``scientific consensus into a political
consensus.''
   ``We have to act now,'' said Kean. ``Otherwise we'll have the
most studied environmental disaster in history.''
   In addition to those steps, Sagan urged further improvements in
fuel efficiency, increased emphasis on alternative fuel sources
including solar energy and the planting of more trees to compensate
for tree destruction taking place around the world.

<TEXT>
   The House Monday approved a $1.6 billion
measure to pay for operations of the legislative branch in the
coming year after making a minimal trim in its own election-year
mailing expenses.
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would provide about $125
million for House mailing expenses over the coming year, an
increase of 130 percent from the current year's figure of $54
million.
   ``This bill is a bit of an embarrassment,'' said Rep. Bill
Frenzel, R-Minn. ``Mailing is the last black hole of Congress.''
   Frenzel said lawmakers are increasingly abusing their mailing
privileges to ensure their re-elections rather than simply
responding to mail from home.
   ``Very few people ask for our newsletters, so we mail them to
everybody,'' he said. ``They don't write us and so we buy lists and
send personal unsolicited first class letters to people who never
communicated with us.''
   The bill pays for salaries of congressional staff members,
office expenses, and related agencies like the Library of Congress
and Capitol police force for the year beginning Oct. 1. It did not
include Senate expenses, estimated to total some $450 million,
which will be added when the measure goes to the other side of the
Capitol.
   Lawmakers voted 392-10 to reduce from six to four the number of
district-wide postal patron newsletters each House member can mail
in each two-year term. But they left a loophole that permits
continued unlimited mailings of notices for ``town hall'' type
meetings.
   Frenzel said those mailings are being abused.
   ``Some of the meetings only attract two to ten people, but the
notices are mailed to 200,000 people. It's a device to put their
names in the mailbox and increase their name recognition,'' he said.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee which produced the bill, agreed mailing has become a
problem. But he said he was reluctant to curb what is for some
lawmakers their primary means of communicating with constituents.
   The House also adopted, by 405-8, an amendment by Rep. Tim
Penny, D-Minn., to cut $10 million from the mailing account. But
such a move means little since Congress routinely overspends its
mailing account and adds money later to make up the deficit.
   They also approved, on a voice vote, language requiring that
mass-mailed newsletters be postmarked at least 60 days before an
election. That would eliminate the practice of last-minute
newsletters that become tangled in production backlogs and end up
being mailed by incumbents during the height of campaign season.
   The House rejected, by 246-167, an effort by Frenzel to cut $97
million from the bill, which would have held the growth in
congressional spending to about the rate of increase in the rest of
the government.

   The FBI will determine if a black
teen-ager's civil rights were violated before he drowned while
trying to swim across the rain-swollen Ottawa River, allegedly to
elude police, an FBI agent said Monday.
   The Fire Division's water-rescue unit was not sent for more than
an hour _ including a five-minute wait for a shift-change to avoid
overtime _ prompting demands by some city officials and civil
rights leaders that City Manager Philip Hawkey investigate the
incident.
   The FBI was asked to investigate by the Rev. Floyd Rose, a
leader of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, a group of
ministers active in civil rights issues. Rose contends that if
Robert Thomas had been white, rescuers would have been sent much
sooner.
   Thomas, 16, a high school honor student, was among four youths
who police say tried to steal several cases of soda early Wednesday
from a store near the University of Toledo.
   Senior agent Harold Jones said the FBI will focus on whether
Thomas' civil rights were violated before he jumped into the river.
   ``We're not going to look into the fact that he drowned and
there may have been a delay in responding with rescue people.
That's not a civil rights aspect,'' Jones said. ``We're going to
open up a preliminary investigation this week just to determine
what the facts are, to see if there's any reason to go any further
with it.''
   Agents will have 20 days to complete the investigation. The
results will be sent to the Department of Justice for a final
determination.
   City Councilman Jack Ford demanded Monday that Hawkey answer
questions about the incident. Rose also called for a city
investigation.
   ``It's obvious to me that they saw a fleeing suspect rather than
a drowning youth, and that sometimes clouds your mind and clouds
your thinking as to what to do next,'' Rose said.
   Thomas jumped into the river at about 6 a.m. while being chased
by a university police officer, authorities said.
   At least 65 minutes elapsed before Fire Division rescue
personnel were sent out, according to recorded conversations
between Fire Chief William Winkle and a dispatcher. All fire
department dispatches are taped.
   The tapes indicated that a city police officer on the scene did
not call for the rescue unit immediately, and that Winkle was
reluctant to send the unit until he had arrived at the river.
   Once Winkle decided that rescue workers were needed, he ordered
an additional five-minute delay until the next shift came on duty,
saying he did not want to pay overtime.
   Winkle said he viewed his department's role as recovering a body
and not saving a life.
   The rescue unit was sent at 7:05 a.m., but it took another hour
before the crew began searching the water. Thomas' body was found
that afternoon, 10 feet from where he entered the river.
   Police Chief Marti Felker said Monday that he would determine if
police policies and procedures were followed and if any new ones
are needed.
   Late Monday, Hawkey and Felker held a news conference to give
the police version of the events that followed Thomas' diving into
the river. Neither Winkle nor any fire department spokesman
appeared at the news conference.
   The university officer, John Betori, last week told reporters he
warned Thomas of the river's swift current seconds before Thomas
dove in. Betori also said he saw Thomas struggle and go under twice
before disappearing.
   Chief Felker, however, said Betori told city police Sgt. Dennie
Sehlmeyer _ the first Toledo officer to arrive _ that he thought
Thomas had made it to the other side and was hiding under debris.
   ``That's why they searched the riverbank before calling in
rescue crews,'' Felker said. Telephone calls to Betori's home
Monday were not answered.
   Felker said Sehlmeyer cut down on confusion when he called for
help on a nearby pay telephone instead of his hand radio. The chief
said the radio can only contact police and the water-rescue unit is
operated by the Fire Division.
   ``What he did actually helped speed things up because he didn't
have to go through a police dispatcher. He went straight to the
fire dispatcher,'' he said.
   Hawkey said he would investigate the incident, but said both
divisions correctly followed procedures.
   ``We want to show the community that proper procedures were
followed and diligence was exercised for the care and concerns of
everybody involved,'' Hawkey said.
   Ford said he could not understand why more emphasis was not
placed on saving the youth's life.
   ``Throughout this, I am reminded that individuals have fallen
into the water _ sometimes for minutes _ and have been revived. So
time was of essence throughout this whole scenario, and yet that
thought never went through the minds of our officers,'' he said.
   The three other youths suspected in the theft remain at large.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will make a 10-day
trip to South Korea, Japan and the Philippines in late September,
his office said Monday.
   The vice president's office announced the Asian visit after
Quayle met Monday with Michio Ochi, a Japanese cabinet minister in
charge of that nation's Economic Planning Agency.
   Quayle plans to leave Sept. 18 for Seoul and to spend Sept.
22-24 in Japan before continuing to Manila, spokesman David
Beckwith said.
   The Centerpiece of the tour will be the fourth party leaders'
meeting in Tokyo of the International Democratic Union, a global
association of political parties of democratic countries, Beckwith
said.
   Quayle's half-hour meeting with Ochi was described by Beckwith
as the first of a series of briefings in preparation for Quayle's
talks with leaders of the three Asian countries he will visit.
   Quayle visited Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and Australia
in April on his first overseas tour as vice president, and he
visited Japan as a senator.

<HEAD>BBC Television Program Defends Rushdie Despite Church Objection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. presented a
television program Monday about Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' despite a Church of England objection that it
might offend Moslems.
   ``The Blasphemers' Banquet,'' a 40-minute play shown on the BBC
national network, had actors portraying historical blasphemers
around a restaurant table in northern Bradford reciting their
writings. Portrayed were Voltaire, Moliere, Omar Khayyam and Lord
Byron, but Rushdie's chair was empty.
   Moslem religious authorities consider Rushdie's novel
blasphemous to Islam. The author has been in hiding since the late
Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, urged
Moslems to kill him.
   Some of the 60,000 Moslems in Bradford were among the first to
burn copies of the novel in January.
   The BBC said Monday it wrote to Archbishop Robert Runcie,
spiritual head of the state Church of England, saying the
``sensibilities surrounding the program had been considered
carefully within the BBC and a great deal of advice had been sought
on its content from both within and outside the BBC.''
   John Lyttle, Runcie's public affairs secretary, said he wrote
last week on behalf of the archbishop to BBC director-general
Michael Checkland expressing concern about the program's possible
effect on Moslems in Britain.
   Lyttle said Rushdie denied any intention of blaspheming Islam
and reforms in Iran since Khomeini's death made it the wrong moment
to attack Iranian fundamentalism.
   Neither he nor the archbishop had seen the program and their
objections were based on advance information, Lyttle said.
   ``We want to resolve the Rushdie problem, not inflame it,'' he
said.

   Forest and brush fires raged along the French
Riviera and on the Mediterranean island of Corsica Monday, killing
two Italian tourists who drove into a wall of fire, police reported.
   The tourists, who were not immediately identified, were driving
near Corsica's northern tip when their auto ran into the flames
that destroyed more than 2,500 acres of scrub land, according to
police. They said two other people in the car suffered serious
injuries and burns.
   Several campgrounds were ordered evacuated and members of the
French Foreign Legion posted on the island were helping fight the
fires.
   Fires have broken out all along the Riviera, which is suffering
searing temperatures and gusty winds. Most were put out quickly.
   Threatening flames moved up to the outskirts of Nice's suburbs.
Police said many people rushed home from work to make sure their
houses were safe, but only one building was ordered evacuated.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Slams `Confusion' Over Bush Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Contra official on Monday accused the Bush
administration of giving conflicting signals on its support for the
Nicaraguan rebels, saying the confusion threatens efforts to
democratize that nation.
   The latest frustration for Contra leaders came over an
initiative by Central American nations to disarm rebels camped in
Honduras prior to next February's scheduled Nicaraguan presidential
elections.
   While President Bush publicly opposes disarming the Contras
before the vote, at least one State Department official, Oscar
Sereseres, has told regional leaders the United States might agree
to an earlier date, said rebel director Adolfo Calero.
   ``My belief is that these people don't know where they are
going,'' Calero said of administration officials. ``That shows the
lack of a detailed and clear policy.''
   He said the confusion ``doesn't contribute to a good outcome of
the summit'' of Central American leaders later this week.
   He also said in the past few days the State Department tried to
obstruct a meeting between the Contras and internal Nicaraguan
opposition groups, but the participants had gone ahead anyway.
   ``It's ridiculous that at such a critical moment there are
persons in the State Department who are trying to usurp'' policy in
Central America, Calero said. ``I would like to hear a single
voice, we would like them to respect the institutionality of the
resistance, not undermine the resistance.''
   He warned that the confusion would have serious consequences for
the effort to democratize Nicaragua.
   ``It will also have both human and political consequences for
the fate of thousands of Nicaraguans who have fought the
Sandinistas supported by the U.S. government, armed by the U.S.
government and financed by the U.S. government,'' he said.
   The Contras at present receive only humanitarian aid from the
United States as part of a bipartisan foreign policy initiative
aimed at achieving a regional peace in Central America.
   Although many rebel fighters have abandoned the struggle,
thousands remain camped just across the Nicaraguan border in
Honduras.
   Calero said the Contras were aware of a proposal by Honduras to
enter the Contra camps and disarm the rebel troops, but said such
action was not likely without the approval of all the Central
American leaders at the summit.
   ``They are not going to do it on their own,'' he said. ``They do
not want a confrontation with the resistance.''

   Violinist Eugene Fodor Jr., whose intensity and
talent won him early rewards at the White House and in Moscow, has
landed in jail on charges that relatives said stemmed from a drug
problem.
   Fodor, 39, was being held on cocaine trafficking, cocaine and
heroin possession and breaking-and-entering charges after a judge
refused to accept his offer of a 300-year-old violin to guarantee
bail. Instead, the judge Friday set $50,000 cash bail.
   On Thursday, chambermaids at a Martha's Vineyard hotel found him
in a room that was supposed to be empty and called police, who said
they found 20 grams of cocaine, heroin, a hypodermic needle and a
dagger in Fodor's possession.
   A family member in New York who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Sunday the arrest likely stems from Fodor's drug use, which
she said may be rooted in the same intensity that fires his musical
creativity.
   ``The only explanation I can think of is that he does everything
in a thorough way,'' she said. ``He's a genius in his work and he
devotes all his energy to his work. He's very intense in whatever
he does.''

<HEAD>Dr. Brazelton Looks at Child Development in Cable Series</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The message of Dr. T. Berry Brazelton's new
cable series on child development is: Let the child guide the
parent.
   For the Lifetime Network series, called ``What Every Baby Knows:
The First Three Years,'' cameras followed the development of 12
children for one year. The 39 half-hour shows will premiere on
Lifetime on Saturday.
   ``I was very aware of how hungry parents were for answers to the
issues that they expressed through worries about toilet training,
thumb sucking, but underlying that are much more deep-seated need
for support and understanding and a cultural commitment to what
they're doing,'' Brazelton said in a telephone interview from his
summer home on Cape Cod. The pediatrician has been helping mothers
with their children in a show on Lifetime for six years.
   ``The thing I want to achieve is to have mothers watch their
babies and learn what their babies are trying to tell them. If the
parents watch they can learn.''
   Called this generation's Dr. Benjamin Spock, Brazelton is a
clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School,
professor of pediatrics and child development at Boston University,
and founder and chief of the Development Unit at Boston Children's
Hospital Medical Center.
   ``Here's a pediatrician who's 70 years old, with one foot in the
past and one foot in the future,'' said Chuck Bangert, who produces
the series with Lou Gorfain and Hank O'Karma.
   ``Dr. Brazelton is very practical. His contention is that a baby
basically will tell you what's wrong.''
   ``The basic thrust of the show is to trust your own instincts,''
said Gorfain.
   ``We picked 12 families and mostly tell the story of their
office visits to Dr. Brazelton,'' said Gorfain, noting that the
cameras also show the children at home.
   Four children are featured in each age group: newborn to age 1,
a time of discovery; ``the terrible twos'' when they develop a
sense of self; and the third year, a time of growing autonomy and
socialization.
   The families selected represent various ethnic and economic
groups, as well as a couple on the verge of divorce, a
single-parent family, a multi-generation family, working mothers
and mothers at home.
   ``The way people are willing to share their anxieties, their
concerns, their stresses, and let down their defenses in front of a
camera is incredible to me,'' said Dr. Brazelton.
   Bangert said Brazelton is a hero to many mothers. ``Women in a
Playboy magazine poll selected him as the man they'd most want to
be shipwrecked with. Airline stewardesses always seat him in first
class because they want to talk to him. ...
   ``He believes in setting more limits for children than Spock. In
fact, the most common question he gets is about setting limits. But
he doesn't advocate spanking. He says if you spank a child, when he
gets older he will strike someone who displeases him. He's also a
great advocate of grandparents. He says children should have a safe
place where they can occasionally escape some of the restrictions.''
   The producers passed on other advice from Dr. Brazelton: Don't
worry if the child doesn't eat vegetables, as long as the child
gets milk and multivitamins. Peer pressure will stop bed-wetting
quicker than anything else.
   Bangert and Gorfain, who have won six Emmys, have also produced
``The Body Human'' for CBS and ``Trackdown,'' a special about the
``Green River killer'' in Washington state. Gorfain said two
viewers have led authorities to a major suspect in the serial
killings.
   They're producing a show for ABC about hunting down parole
violators, with Avery Brooks as the host; ``Code I,'' an ABC pilot
about emergency medical services with Pernell Roberts as host, and
a CBS movie giving a fictionalized account of two producers doing a
special about a serial killer.

   In Cedar Rapids, Iowa _ halfway across the
country from Hollywood _ lives a recent high school graduate with
the perfect name for an actress: Annabeth Gish.
   She shares the last name of one of the cinema's greatest stars,
Lillian Gish, and decided quickly on a career in movies. But
walking the streets, she feels pretty much like any other resident,
even if some have not forgotten last year's ``Mystic Pizza,'' in
which Gish plays a baby sitter who falls in love with the child's
father.
   ``I was baby-sitting for this family at the time,'' she recalled.
   ``They saw this movie and thought, `uh, oh.' I got a lot of
razzing about that. When you're in a high school environment and
people are seeing you play an older character having more mature
things happen, it's pretty confusing.''
   After her latest movie, ``Shag,'' Iowans may be tempted to award
blue ribbons and break into dance upon spotting Gish. The actress
plays Pudge Carmichael, one of four high school senior girls in
1963 who sneak off to Myrtle Beach, S.C., in search of a last
adventure before going off to college and the ``real'' world.
   The film's title comes from a popular dance that Pudge masters.
   ``I read the script and just fell in love with the liveliness,''
Gish said in an interview. ``I wanted to be a part of it, and did a
lot of background on the Shag becuase I had never heard of it. It's
a very big deal down in Myrtle Beach and it kept getting more and
more fascinating.''
   Gish's brief career in show business has also been far from
Hollywood. ``Desert Bloom,'' her film debut, was made in Tucson,
Ariz., while Mystic, Conn., was the setting for ``Mystic Pizza.''
   ``Shag'' was primarily filmed in Myrtle Beach.
   ``I went down a little bit earlier and had the luxury of
learning from some authentic shaggers,'' said Gish, a proud member
of the Shag Hall of Fame. ``It was a different experience for them.
I think they were a little bit wary of what this Hollywood movie
company was going to represent their dance as.''
   The cast includes several relatives of Hollywood stars: Bridget
Fonda is the daughter of Peter Fonda and niece of Jane Fonda;
Tyrone Power Jr. is the late actor's son; Page Hannah is Daryl
Hannah's sister; and Carrie Hamilton is the daughter of Carol
Burnett.
   But Gish is not related to Lillian Gish and set out to be an
actress before even knowing the significance of her last name.
   ``When I was in first grade I went to the Halloween parade as a
movie star. When I was in third grade, I wrote that when I grow up
I would like to be an actress in the movies. I was very into
watching movies. I really enjoyed reading aloud, performing.''
   By the time the aspiring actress turned 13, she was fully aware
of her namesake and wrote for advice.
   ``She discouraged me from getting involved in the business. She
said there was too much talent and not enough work and it was
better to stay in an environment where you where loved and cared
for.''
   But the young Gish had her mind made up. She had been acting in
community theater since age 8 and fell in love with movies,
especially the Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn screwball comedy
``Bringing Up Baby,'' and Lillian Gish's silent classic ``The
Wind.''
   ``I think Katharine Hepburn was great, being a strong,
individualized woman, playing these great characters,'' she said.
   Gish's stage debut, however, was more humble.
   ``My first play was called `Wylie and the Hairyman,''' she
recalled. ``My mom was the Hairyman and I was the swamp. I wore
tie-dyed long johns, but it was fun. I got to gurgle and bubble.''
   She was soon playing real people and, in 1986, starred as the
perceptive stepdaughter of an alcoholic (Jon Voight) in ``Desert
Bloom.''
   ``Having that as my first experience was really a blessing,''
said Gish. ``It kind of set my path in the right direction. When
you're surrounded by people who are passionate about their work, it
made all the difference.
   She followed with ``Hiding Out,'' and appeared on television in
``Hero in the Family,'' an ABC Disney Sunday Night Movie. Last
year, Gish stayed in Cedar Rapids, finishing her high school
education. This fall, instead of heading for the West Coast, she
will begin classes at Duke University.
   ``I've strived to maintain some normalcy in my life, some
groundedness'' Gish said.
   ``If I had have moved out to L.A., which there were pressures to
do, and started working right away and given up on my education, it
would have been so easy for me to be corrupted or eaten by the
sharks. My parents are like my support system.''

   Gregg Keplinger was noisily bashing in the edge
of a piece of stainless steel tubing when it occurred to him there
must be a better way to make a snare drum.
   Sprawled on the floor of his tiny house below Interstate 5, he
put down his 12-pound sledgehammer and picked up a file.
   After several hours, the edge of the steel tube was shaped like
an upside-down ``U'' that held the head of the drum as well as a
curved lip on an ordinary, thinner-walled drum shell.
   When he assembled the drum and played it, Keplinger discovered
he had made an instrument that sounded louder, clearer and more
resonant than any snare drum he had ever played.
   ``It was an accident. I had no idea they'd sound the way they
did,'' Keplinger says of the first comparatively crude instruments
he made 10 years ago.
   Around 200 snare drums later, professional drummers consider
Keplinger one of the leading snare drum craftsmen in the United
States, and probably the best one working with metal.
   He is the only one, as far as drum experts know, who makes snare
drums of black iron and stainless steel. He is one of the few who
uses brass and aluminum.
   Keplinger's drums are custom-made and are regarded as the
Ferraris or Lamborghinis of snare drums. He has reproduced drums
from centuries ago that replicate the original sound to the
satisfaction of a classical musician.
   ``It has warm, deep, fat tones. It covers all the areas and it's
the loudest damn drum I've ever heard,'' said Dony Wynn, drummer
for pop singer Robert Palmer.
   Wynn has two Keplinger drums, named ``Biscuit'' and ``Not
Fragile.'' He plays them on Palmer's latest album, and they're his
favorites of over 100 drums he owns.
   Other drummers who use Keplinger snares include The Grateful
Dead's Mickey Hart, John Molo of Bruce Hornsby and The Range, John
Hernandez of the rock group Oingo Boingo, jazz drummer Art Blakey
and Howard Gilbert, percussionist with the Seattle Symphony
Orchestra.
   ``It's a good drum. I wouldn't be playing it if it weren't,''
Blakey said.
   ``It is very powerful and very exact,'' said Hernandez. ``You
can hear them from miles away _ they just sing.''
   The Seattle-born Keplinger was a drummer for a local group when
he fell into crafting snares. He decided he wanted a 6{-inch deep
steel snare with six lugs, not the usual eight, and couldn't find
one commercially.
   Lugs, which are attached to the outside of the drum shell, serve
as mounts for hardware that tightens the drum head over the shell.
Keplinger felt six lugs would give him a more open, airier sound.
   It was while he was making that drum that he stumbled upon the
idea of simply filing the edge rather than bending it over. He
could do this because the metal he used was [-inch thick _ about
twice as thick as a regular snare shell. Also, commercial snares
are almost always made of wood.
   ``There's nothing inside the drum to disrupt air displacement _
it's just an empty cylinder,'' Keplinger said. And the thick, rigid
metal shell doesn't vibrate as thinner shells do.
   The key to the quality of the drums is the shell, both the grade
of the metal and the machining at the edge. Keplinger has a
trademark for the shell and sometimes sells just shells.
   He started using tubes cut to size, then switched to flat sheets
of metal that he has cut to order, rolled and welded. The metal is
11- or 12-gauge, compared with the roughly 22-gauge, or under
one-sixteenth of an inch, of most commercial snare drum walls.
   He files the edges and the snare bed by hand ``until it looks
right.'' The snare bed is a slight dip in the bottom rim of the
drum shell. The snare wires are stretched over the bed to give the
drum its characteristic snappy sound. A hand-held awl and a drill
press mounted on Keplinger's kitchen counter make holes for
attaching the hardware he orders to a customer's specifications
from over a dozen commercial drum manufacturers.
   Each drum shell is dated and signed ``Gregg Keplinger'' on the
inside. Only recently did he begin numbering them.
   The entire process takes about four six-hour days to complete.
   Keplinger has made drums that range from three inches deep,
called a piccolo snare because of its higher, snappier tone, to a
24-inch deep ``tambour provencal,'' a medieval snare that Gilbert
ordered when he couldn't find one in Germany, the last place they
were made. Some music scores ask specifically for the instrument,
which sounds like ``a dry growl in a distance,'' Keplinger said.
   All the recordings made by the Seattle Symphony have Keplinger
drums on them, including a Prokofiev piece that features a piccolo
snare solo, Gilbert said.
   ``Some people don't like Gregg's stuff because it's so heavy,
but that's what makes it generate sound ... You want it to go boom,
not clank,'' said Joseph Montineri, a well-known wooden snare drum
craftsman based in Manchester, Conn. Montineri said he uses
Keplinger shells for some of his customers.
   A 7-inch-deep snare of brass weighs around 20 pounds. Keplinger
recently started using bronze which weighs less than brass.
   Metal drums are also not for every piece of music. Wooden snare
drums tend to have a more acoustic, warmer sound. Professional
drummers often have dozens of snares they will interchange
depending on the sound they want.
   Keplinger's drums range in price from $625 to $850 _ roughly
three times the price of a commercial snare, although less
expensive than imported specialty snares, which can cost up to
$2,000.
   Although he advertises in Modern Drummer, a trade magazine, most
of his business comes from word of mouth, or appearances at the
annual National Association of Music Merchandisers' trade fair. The
only commercial outlet for which he makes them is American Music, a
small, Seattle-based music chain.
   He is thinking of giving the whole thing up. Even after 10 years
and a long list of prominent clients, he averages about two drums a
month, and the work is far from steady. ``The main thing for me is
the quality, the integrity. I don't want to make more drums if that
would change.''
   So he plays jazz and rock gigs, circuses, weddings and anything
else he can to make ends meet. He's 42 and has done nothing but
drum-related work since he was 18.
   His one-room house is full to the roof with drums, drum parts
and equipment for making and carrying drums.
   ``You get a passion for something. Mine just happens to take up
the whole house,'' he says.

   In-house comedy clubs are catching on as
Nevada casinos turn to low-priced new comics to give gamblers a few
laughs between forays at the slot machines and gaming tables.
   ``This is definitely a trend that we've hopped onto,'' said Jim
Johnson, marketng director for the Flamingo Hilton Reno which
recently opened a new comedy club.
   ``There's been a resurgence of comedy all over the country. It
used to be, in the times of Jack Benny and Bob Hope, that comedy
was big in entertainment. Now, I think we're back to that.''
   The lone exception to the comedy clubs' recent success story is
Rodney Dangerfield, who got no respect in Las Vegas.
   Rodney's Place, a joint venture between the veteran comedian and
the Tropicana Resort and Casino, closed June 25, six months after
it opened, when Dangerfield and the club couldn't agree on a new
contract.
   ``We haven't given up on the idea of opening it up again as a
comedy club,'' said Larry Lee, director of entertainment at the
Tropicana. ``We're talking with six national comedy chains. We
could go with something else, but we're leaning toward comedy now
because it worked so well.''
   The idea of using laughter to ease losing gamblers' pain isn't
new. Comedians have been opening for big-name headliners such as
Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. for decades. Comics who started
out in Nevada casinos and still play their showrooms include Joan
Rivers, Bill Cosby and Jay Leno.
   More traditional production shows with their showgirls in
sequins, elaborate headdresses and little else also use comedy acts
to break up song and dance routines.
   But a few years ago in Las Vegas, in-house casino comedy clubs
began popping up to feed a nationwide appetite for laughter. The
trend now has invaded northern Nevada where casinos are leaning
away from multimillion dollar headliners and production shows in
favor of cheap laughs.
   Most unknown comics make a few hundred dollars for an appearance
while better-known entertainers, such as ``Saturday Night Live''
regular Kevin Nealon and ``Night Court'' bailiff Marsha Warfield
receive paychecks in the thousands.
   ``We were looking for a way to keep the customers on the
property longer and to attract locals to the club,'' said Michael
Opton, marketing director for Reno's Ramada Inn hotel casino, which
houses the Comedy Circuit.
   ``At first we looked at a production show. But we didn't have
the room. And, we thought, `why not try comedy? It's cheaper, too.'
''
   The Reno Ramada has run the Comedy Circuit for the past eight
months and now has competition from the Flamingo Hilton Reno, which
opened its Comedy Club July 4.
   Caesars Tahoe at Stateline, Nev., on Lake Tahoe's south shore
has been showcasing young comics for the past few years in its Laff
Trax. Bally's-Reno, where the spectacular ``Hello Hollywood,
Hello'' production closed out an 11-year run in April, is thinking
of opening a Catch a Rising Star as an outlet of the New York
comedy club where amateurs are welcome to try out.
   Johnson said the Reno Hilton is giving the Comedy Club a trial
through the summer to determine if it will attract enough customers.
   ``We've seen slow, steady growth since it opened,'' Johnson
said. ``But we're not getting the traditional crowd _ out-of-town
tourists in their 50s. We're getting a much younger crowd and some
repeat business.''
   In Las Vegas, casino comedy tickles gamblers in such venues as
Catch a Rising Star at Bally's and The Comedy Store at the Dunes.
   Most of the casino comedy clubs rotate well-known and new
comedians every one or two weeks, with two to three comics a night
for a standard show lasting 90 minutes.
   Admission generally runs $8-$10 and includes one or two drinks.
That's slightly more expensive than the two-drink price of a normal
caberet show but far less than a showroom production where dinner
and drinks can leave two people with a three-digit bill at the end
of the night.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Napoleon III reshaped parts of
Paris, Mussolini an area of Rome and Stalin the center of Moscow,
so too has Nicolae Ceausescu re-designed Bucharest, Romania's
capital.
   In just five years, 19 churches, a synagogue and hundreds of
private homes have vanished from the city's centuries-old center,
victims of a vision of grandeur now nearing completion.
   On Aug. 23, a national holiday marking the 45th anniversary of a
successful uprising against a pro-Nazi government, Ceausescu and
his wife, Elena, will formally open the Palace of the People, a
white stone structure of vastly surreal proportions topped by a
triangular metal flagpole.
   From this 20th-century fortress, the Ceausescus will rule their
land and watch over the top government and Communist Party offices
housed in the palace.
   The palace faces on the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, a
three-mile avenue that cuts defiantly through the old city center.
It is there, according to Ceausescu's plans, government and party
officials, who are now sequestered in cozy villas, will inhabit
40,000 apartments in stylish, 10-story buildings. They have risen
in just four years and are now complete with ground-floor shops
that stock luxury goods for purchase only by foreign delegations.
   Elaborate fountains play along the center of the avenue,
popularly called the ``Boulevard of the Victory of Bankruptcy.''
   But behind the empty, gleaming buildings wires hang out of
walls, bulldozers and cranes are at work and the whole project has
an unfinished air that suggests it will not be ready for full
habitation by Aug. 23.
   At the 18th-century Antim Monastery, nestled behind the gleaming
white buildings, the synodical library looks oddly out of place.
   Bishop Nifon of the the Romanian Orthodox Church explained the
building was moved a few yards so it could be preserved but not
interfere with the new civic center.
   He said a few churches _ ``not of too much historical
importance'' _ were destroyed for the project, while at least eight
others have been moved so that they are now hidden behind the new
buildings.
   This reorganization of the landscape is going on throughout
Bucharest, as well as the rest of Romania.
   City centers that grew centuries now contain heaps of rubble and
dozens of impersonal new towers of concrete that outwardly fulfill
the universally propagated ideal of transforming Romania into a
modern, industrial society.
   Four settlements around Bucharest have literally been wiped off
the map, according to Western diplomats.
   But travel throughout Romania suggests to foreigners and
diplomats that most of the 8,000 villages designated for absorption
into larger ``agro-industrial centers'' under a scheme to
``systematize'' the countryside will not be destroyed but simply
slide into decay.
   There had been fears in the West, and particularly in Hungary,
that thousands of such villages would be bulldozed under
Ceausescu's plan.
   In cities, the modernization drive has destroyed hundreds of
villas deemed too bourgeois in appearance for modern Romania. An
estimated 40,000 residents of the capital were moved to make way
for the giant new Civic Center.
   There are some benefits to the vast building program.
   Bucharest, a city of 2.5 million, now has a subway that anybody
can use for just 10 cents as an alternative to usually jammed
trolley cars and buses.
   An artificial lake and swimming pool complex also have been
built near one of Bucharest's endless high-rise residential areas.

<TEXT>
   It was not yet 7 a.m., and a morning chill
hung over the green meadows and gardens of this quiet town near
snow-capped Mount Rainier.
   Roosters crowed, and old dogs on front porches yawned to greet
another summer day. Dairy farmer Tom LaCrosse was in his barn,
already hard at work, with no reason to doubt he'd be around to
savor the warmth of noon.
   A few minutes later, a distraught man named Kenneth Gehring
stormed into the farmyard with a rifle in his hand. A few minutes
later still, four people lay dying: LaCrosse and his wife, Rutheda;
milk truck driver Kirby Hull; and Gehring, who turned the gun on
himself when he saw what he had done.
   The violence was not confined to the LaCrosse farm. It shocked
this town of 3,500, touching everyone who knew the victims,
stealing from everyone who had cherished a peaceful life away from
urban woes.
   ``In a small community like this, when someone is taken, it
takes a piece out of everyone here,'' said neighbor Karen Stannard.
   Moving to the country does not guarantee a safe and sheltered
life.
   FBI statistics show that while big cities still suffer the
nation's highest murder rates, rural counties consistently place
second, with a per-capita murder rate outstripping the suburbs and
smaller cities.
   And that's just the average. Certain rural areas _ gripped by
poverty, low education levels and disruptive social change _ have
developed what some sociologists call a ``culture of violence''
that sends murder rates rising high above national norms. Areas
singled out include those populated by minorities that have
historically been oppressed: the black South, Hispanic Southwest,
and the Indian country of Western reservations and Alaska.
   The latest FBI numbers available show that the nation's rural
counties reported 1,233 murder arrests in 1987, for a rate of 5.7
murders for 100,000 residents. The average rate for all U.S. cities
was 10.2 while the average for suburbs was 4.9.
   Rural murder shatters the idyllic image that many have of
country life, and indeed, it bucks the trend of most crime. Most
rural places have lower rates of theft, vandalism, rape and assault
than do more populous areas.
   Murder statistics may differ, sociologists suggest, because
killing can be a very personal affair.
   ``Homicide is something that typically occurs among people who
have a close relationship with each other,'' said Kenneth
Wilkinson, a rural sociologist at Pennsylvania State University.
   One theory holds that in rural areas, people have a higher
proportion of primary relationships _ an academic way of saying
that everybody knows everybody else's business. When life turns
sour, an individual may lash out at people he knows well, and that
can be almost anyone in the area.
   Wilkinson offered another possible cause: the erosion of
community bonds in rural areas.
   ``The romantic images of the rural past indicate a closeness of
community,'' he said. ``In contrast to our image of the way things
used to be, rural areas tend to have weak community relationships.''
   The small town once may have supplied most of a person's social,
emotional and economic needs, but now country dwellers often must
travel far to urban centers to satisfy those needs _ or leave them
unsatisfied until that leads to violence.
   Such theories are unsatisfying when the statistics turn specific
and the incomprehensible happens close to home. Such was the case
June 7 in Graham.
   Tom and Rutheda LaCrosse, both 63, were well-liked and ran their
farms as cleanly as their personal lives. Tom had operated his
400-cow dairy, one of the county's largest, for 23 years. Rutheda
was judged young enough at heart to be elected queen of this year's
Pierce County Fair.
   Neighbors say they were people who wouldn't hesitate to help a
friend in trouble, and such a friend was Eileen May Gehring. She
had problems with her estranged husband, Kenneth Gehring, who was
ignoring a judge's order to stay away from his wife. On June 6,
while his wife visited the LaCrosses, Gehring arrived and drove her
car away. A sheriff's deputy gave her a ride home.
   Gehring returned the next morning, apparently looking for his
wife. According to sheriff's reports, Gehring drove into the
farmyard and confronted truck driver Kirby Hull outside the milking
barn. After some angry words, Gehring shot Hull.
   Tom LaCrosse and a farm worker rushed from the barn's office to
find Gehring holding a .22-caliber rifle. Gehring forced LaCrosse
into the farmhouse, and there he killed the farmer and Mrs.
LaCrosse, then shot himself in the head.
   Investigators said Gehring had no criminal history, and there
was no indication the slayings were motivated by anything but
unresolved anger over his impending divorce.
   The frightening frequency of urban slayings has conditioned many
people to expect such grisly events in big cities. But it's just
not supposed to happen in a place like Graham. The rural murder
rate, while high, spreads itself across huge and sparsely populated
areas, making murder in any one small town a rare event.
   It can breed fear of crime and fear of strangers, which
Wilkinson said is not only unfortunate but misdirected, ``because
when trouble arises, usually the killer is someone you know.''
After a slaying, voters seeking a scapegoat have been known to oust
the local sheriff, who may be more used to investigating bicycle
thefts than homicide.
   ``In rural areas where homicides happen, it's wrenching,''
Wilkinson said. ``People wonder, `What's happening to our
community?'''
   Down at Graham Auto Parts, manager Bob Sorenson mourns the
farmer who used to grab him playfully in a headlock until Sorenson
grew old enough to put the hold on LaCrosse.
   ``It's hard to believe you could know somebody that long, and
that he could go so quickly,'' Sorenson said.
   The funeral was weeks ago now, and talk at the post office and
Sorenson's store is back to the county fair and carburetors. But
Graham will never be quite the same. A measure of its innocence was
stolen that day in June.
   ``It has made us more cautious,'' said Karen Stannard. ``I think
there are doors being locked now that were never locked before.''

   Mamie and Earl Pendleton live in a
dilapidated trailer that's often too hot or cold and always too
cramped. But life is better than it once was _ now they have indoor
plumbing.
   It wasn't long ago the Pendletons and their three daughters
lived in another mobile home where a bucket was their toilet, water
was hauled from wells and five of them slept in a bed. Still,
they're far from comfortable.
   ``At times you can get so depressed and downhearted, you can
almost lay down and die,'' Mrs. Pendleton said. ``It's so hard to
think about tomorrow because you're struggling with today. At times
I feel fortunate I've got what I got. I feel guilty wishing I did
have better. I remember what I used to have.''
   In a way, the Pendletons reflect the progress made and problems
that remain in rural housing. Millions of rural Americans are
housed better than they were a decade ago, but millions more are
trapped in substandard conditions, unable to afford or find decent
shelter.
   ``You've still got 7 or 8 million people living without a
toilet, without a sink or running water in this day and age,'' said
Bob Rapoza, the National Rural Housing Coalition's legislative
director. ``You've got people living in shacks with no windows.
Many of them don't have a regular stove, they might have
jury-rigged wiring. The basic things we take for granted ... they
don't have.
   ``The problem isn't as visible because we don't have rural areas
in big media markets.''
   Inadequate private financing, budget cutbacks, aging buildings,
poverty and isolation share the blame, according to experts, who
say that one consequence is increasing rural homelessness _ with
some people even living in abandoned school buses or chicken coops.
   More rural than urban residents are homeowners. Millions also
live in mobile homes, which have contributed to the progress, but
they're expensive to maintain and depreciate in value, said Joe
Belden of the Housing Assistance Council, which deals with rural
low-income housing needs.
   ``The situation is improving slowly, but there's still a great,
great distance to go,'' he said.
   A spending and construction explosion from 1970 to '80 halved
the number of rural housing quarters classified as substandard.
Still, 1980 figures found 2.1 million rural substandard housing
units remained and some experts say that number probably has
increased because of farm troubles and the sagging small-town
economy.
   Incomplete plumbing is the biggest rural housing problem _ 1.3
million homes were without it at the start of this decade.
   Living without basics can be devastating, said David Lollis,
director of the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises.
   ``People often are so beaten by their circumstances,'' he said.
``Their health is destroyed. ... It's not only difficult to hold a
job, it makes it difficult for the kids to stay in school. There's
no place ... (or) light to study.
   ``If you're a young girl with no water in the house to keep
clean ... it has terrible negative effects on people's
self-esteem,'' he said. ``That's the kind of thing (that) makes
them give up or destroy whatever hope they have.''
   Areas in the worst shape tend to be the poorest, smallest and
most isolated, where Indians, blacks, Hispanics, farm workers and
impoverished whites live.
   A 1986 Agriculture Department report, based largely on 1980
census figures, said substandard rural housing _ lacking complete
plumbing or having more people than rooms _ was heavily
concentrated in the Southeastern coastal region, southern Texas,
Kentucky, West Virginia, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and South
Dakota.
   But there are problems everywhere.
   In New York, substandard homes in rural Long Island can cost
$100,000, said Sue Montgomery-Corey of the New York State Rural
Housing Coalition.
   In Maine, aging housing and rising land costs in vacation and
retirement areas have squeezed out low-income residents. In parts
of the West, financing is inadequate to replenish or rehabilitate
housing.
   And in California and Florida, farm workers sometimes live in
squalid, dangerous conditions _ 21 people in one trailer, 11
sharing a cinder block room with an outdoor toilet.
   Factors contributing to housing problems include:
   _ Inadequate credit: ``In rural America, there is not the
capital available in the banks and thrifts,'' said Frank DeStefano,
a staffer on the House subcommittee on Housing and Community
Development. Small rural banks are hard-pressed, he said, to make
farm loans, let alone ``lending at the low end of the scale.''
   _ Budget cuts: The Farmers Home Administration, the lead federal
agency providing financing for rural housing, has seen dramatic
cutbacks. From fiscal 1979 to '88, congressional appropriations for
FmHA rural housing programs dropped from $3.8 billion to $1.8
billion in loans, $423 million to $275.3 million in rental
assistance and $51.4 million to $23.8 million in grants, DeStefano
said.
   ``Even at their highest levels, (the programs) were never
meeting the entire demand,'' he added.
   In January 1989, FmHA had more than $1.4 billion in preliminary
applications for rental housing, but only $554 million in funding.
   _ Isolation: The most remote areas often are bypassed because
they have no public utilities and people are too scattered.
   ``FmHA requirements state you have to have basic services
nearby,'' said John Johnson, executive vice president of a Virginia
construction company and secretary of the Council for Rural Housing
and Development.
   Marlyn Aycock, FmHA spokesman, explained: ``If you're 25 miles
in the woods, there's no bus service, no jobs, (the buildings) end
up being vacant and vandalized and the entire investment goes down
the drain.''
   _ Aging stock: Housing is falling into disrepair faster than
it's being built.
   ``People in urban areas generally have a choice _ living in
substandard housing or paying an inordinate amount of rent for
something fairly nice,'' Johnson said. In rural areas, ``even if
you wanted to spend $400-$500 ... there just is no place to live.''
   All of these conditions contribute to growing rural homelessness.
   ``We don't have people sleeping on steam grates,'' Lollis said.
``We have people living in abandoned school buses, abandoned cars
and farm sheds.''
   In Mamie and Earl Pendleton's trailer the front door is secured
at night with a log, and a broken back door is covered with a
stapled tablecloth.
   They can't afford another place on their joint annual income of
less than $4,000. He's a seasonal farm laborer, she works part-time
as cashier at a social-service center.
   In winter, the Pendletons, their 7-year-old twin girls and
14-year-old daughter haul mattresses into the tiny living room to
sleep near the wood stove.
   Sometimes, Earl stays awake because, Mrs. Pendleton explained,
``if the fire goes out, you're going to freeze.''
   But they're grateful because their old trailer was
roach-infested, unbearably hot and without water or toilet.
   ``The nine years were like a nightmare,'' the 36-year-old Mrs.
Pendleton said, wiping away tears.
   She has worked to brighten their home with posters, handmade
curtains, floral decorations and garage sale odds and ends. ``If
everything looks drab, they're going to feel drab,'' she explained.
   Still, she said, ``I would like to have something better for the
kids. I would love to have a carpet. ... It's hard to get out when
you're labeled poor. (The girls) don't do as good in school. They
don't have confidence in themselves.''
   But she keeps pictures of unicorns on her wall _ ``my way of
never giving up hope,'' she said.
   ``If you don't have hopes and dreams, you'll probably give up
and end up in a mental institution. I'm not going to give up.''

   Tom Carew is an ambassador in the hollows
and hills of central Appalachia. His credentials are hammer and
nail. His assignment: wipe out Third World living conditions.
   It seems a daunting task in this corner of eastern Kentucky
where dirt floors, leaking tar-paper roofs and rickety outhouses
aren't Dust Bowl memories, but modern-day realities. For some
folks, heat is a luxury, hot water a convenience beyond their
modest dreams.
   ``They're on the fringe of the economy,'' said Carew, director
of Frontier Housing Inc., a non-profit agency for low-income
people. ``It's Third World living.
   ``When you're living in a cold, lousy, dangerous house, how
happy can you be?'' he added. ``You've got to put up with your
basic survival everyday.''
   Carew's agency is among hundreds of groups across rural America
that build homes and bring hope to people whose shelter often is
little more than a shack insulated with rotting cardboard,
illuminated by a bare bulb.
   Since 1974, Frontier Housing has built 165 homes and
rehabilitated 75 others in a four-county farming and timber area
where poverty rates range from 23 percent to 39 percent.
   It's just a start, considering that in parts of this region one
of every four or five houses is substandard, Carew said. ``If we're
building 20 houses a year, it's going to take a long time.''
   Still, there are plenty of successes.
   Take Ethel Ward, a feisty 64-year-old woman who lives in this
tiny community with her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter in a
neat-as-a-pin three-bedroom home Frontier built in 1988.
   They only have to look in their backyard to see how far they've
come. There sits what's left of their old frame home _ two dark
rooms with a roof that was caving in, roaches, rats, one electrical
circuit, no hot water, tub, shower or toilet.
   ``We didn't have enough room to turn around in. I was afraid the
house was going to burn,'' she said. ``... But what could I do
about it? I wasn't drawing much income. My boy (a sawmill employee)
wasn't working much.''
   Her daughter-in-law, Maggie Davis, said there was no privacy
because the rooms had no doors, no place for her 14-year-old to
study and no way to keep the house dry or clean because of leaks
and bugs she feared would crawl on her at night.
   ``When you don't have any hot water, it's kind of hard to do
anything,'' added Mrs. Davis, who suffers from high blood pressure.
``You felt like your child wasn't clean enough. ... She never did
bring no one home; (she felt) they'd go off and say something.''
   Gayle and Billy Williams, who live in a converted smokehouse
about 30 miles away in Midland, also will see a change in their
surroundings this summer when Frontier remodels their house and
adds a bathroom.
   It will be Mrs. Williams' first indoor toilet. She's 61.
   ``We've managed it OK, but now we're getting older,'' she said.
   Carew said many people in substandard housing rationalize their
plight. ``If you start telling yourself there's a better way to
live, you do yourself in,'' he said. ``It's a means of survival.''
   Helen Barker knew life had more to offer, but it always seemed
beyond her grasp.
   Now, Frontier has built a house for her, her husband, Danny, a
seasonal truck driver, and their five children. For 10 years, they
rented apartments, some with broken pipes and without toilets.
   ``After you have moved around so much, the stability of a home
means so much,'' she said. ``It takes so much worry off your mind.
Seeing it built, it's like a dream come true ... knowing it's going
to be mine. It tickles me to death.''
   The Barkers struggle to pay their $150 monthly rent. Their
monthly mortgage payments will be about $100. Frontier, which
receives state and federal funds, will pay one-third of the
payments up to five years. The Barkers and many other families
Frontier helps receive mortgages through the Farmers Home
Administration.
   For months, Danny Barker would make nightly stops to check on
the progress of the house and report back to his wife. A few weeks
ago, they settled in their new home on a hill deep among the sturdy
Kentucky oaks.
   Mrs. Barker has many plans but says, ``I'll probably sit around
with a smile on my face for the first two months.''

   Ellen Dolan and Joy Jackson have lived 14
miles from town and a mile apart since their teen-agers were
babies. They've been together through diapers, drought and dark
times in rural America.
   Now the two farm women have teamed up to sell popcorn to the
United Arab Emirates, ginseng to South Korea, taco sauce to Saudi
Arabia, hash browns to Australia and oat bran to Wal-mart.
   They are the guiding force behind AMTEX, a homegrown marketing
firm representing small to mid-sized Midwestern companies that
mostly produce so-called value-added foods.
   In 1980 Mrs. Dolan, now 44, was a country girl who planted her
peas and lettuce to suit her aesthetic sense, dabbled at art, and
exchanged dishrags with neighbor women at a monthly coffee klatch.
Her husband, Gary, farmed 2,000 acres with one hired hand and
brought in $750,000 worth of crops.
   But by 1986, when AMTEX was founded by Gary and some other
farmers and businessmen, the farm crisis had forced the Dolans to
buy back their home on the courthouse steps. Most of the machinery
was gone. So was the hired man. Gary Dolan was starting over on the
land, and Ellen Dolan became, without intending to or knowing how,
a fledgling entrepreneur.
   A couple of months after AMTEX started, its office manager quit
``and I was drafted to `make this thing work!' because I was the
only unemployed wife,'' said Mrs. Dolan.
   ``I came in here with no accounts and empty files. I couldn't
run the typewriter, I couldn't understand the concept. Every night
I'd leave here crying. I had no idea what I was supposed to do.
Sell soybeans to Japan? Impossible!''
   Today AMTEX represents 41 companies and is aggressively looking
for more. Mrs. Dolan and Mrs. Jackson, 37, who ``volunteered to
help Ellen get caught up and then we never did,'' say they still
haven't made any money. But they agree that every day they go to
work they feel as if they'll land a big contract.
   ``Enthusiasm is the key to this. We're opportunistic, we're
tenacious,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``We keep reminding ourselves we sold
oat bran cereal to Wal-mart. If we did it once, we can do it
again.''
   It was their first big sale, full of hilarious foul-ups and
tough lessons.
   ``I wrote Sam Walton (founder of Wal-mart) a letter and told him
about AMTEX, then months went by. One day I got a collect call from
the head food buyer, who wanted us to come to Bentonville, Ark.
(Wal-mart headquarters), and show him our products. I told him I'd
have to call him back because neither of us had ever driven through
Kansas City.''
   Laughing hard at the memory, Mrs. Jackson said: ``I panicked and
told Ellen, `Oh, no, I can only drive to the Missouri River, I
can't cross it.' It was like a phobia. Neither one of us had ever,
ever driven in freeway traffic.''
   But after giving each other pep talks, they called Wal-mart
buyer Joe Craig back and said they'd come.
   ``We drove through Kansas City white-knuckle all the way, sick
at our stomachs, convinced we would die on the freeway,'' Mrs.
Dolan said. ``Then we just knew we'd never find Arkansas. Then we
were afraid we'd never find Wal-mart in Bentonville, which is
ludicrous looking back on it, because it's as big as the U.N.''
   Buyer Craig, now working in another Wal-Mart division, remembers
them as ``pretty sharp, open-minded and professional. I was
impressed with them from the beginning.''
   It took 18 months to close the deal, said Mrs. Dolan, ``and in
that time there was a worldwide oats shortage, not enough cardboard
to make the cereal boxes, the original oat bran maker was bought by
another company, and Joe Craig was transferred.''
   Along the way, the women got to know every restaurant in
Bentonville and just about every Wal-Mart receptionist.
   ``Some days this job makes us crazy,'' said Mrs. Jackson, ``and
other days it feeds our souls.''
   Every letter AMTEX sends begins ``Good Day from Trenton,
Missouri, USA!'' Correspondence wings its way from a 10-by-12 foot
cubicle on Main Street in this town of 7,000 to countries all over
the world, as well as hundreds of potential domestic clients.
   ``In return we get letters that begin `An Exceedingly Good Day
from Singapore,''' said Mrs. Dolan. ``It's a thrill because we
don't send three-paragraph corporate letters, we extend a hand in
friendship and offer barbecue sauce on the side.
   ``When we get an overseas call we tell 'em right off that we're
just two farm women in a small office and we're just getting
started, so don't expect a huge staff with BMAs from Harvard, or
whatever those fancy degrees are.''
   Added Mrs. Jackson: ``Somebody in Japan wanted an AMTEX flow
chart. I went home and asked my husband, `Honey, what's a flow
chart?'''
   They may not know the jargon, but they put in 10-hour days
trying to market foods such as smoked meats, bee pollen, popcorn,
Missouri wine and stone-ground flour, as well as homemade lawn
furniture and firewood.
   From the beginning, AMTEX sought help from the Missouri
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
foreign service branch, which publishes descriptions of American
products available for export.
   ``We operate on a shoestring, so we've become aggressive
guerrilla marketers,'' said Mrs. Jackson, explaining they use a
network of government services to make contacts.
   The two friends and co-workers also have become experts in
minutiae, trivia and exotica.
   ``We got a call from Switzerland asking us if we had Boletus
edilus,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``Neither of us had the vaguest idea
what that was, but we thought it might be a plant. We went home,
found out in the encyclopedia it was a dried mushroom, tracked some
down in Poland and put the supplier and the buyer together by
Telex.''
   They also know where to find war-risk insurance, how to get
labeling in Arabic and which freight forwarders are most efficient
in Indonesia.
   Their jobs have changed them and opened new vistas in lives once
focused almost exclusively on home and family.
   ``Joy used to make wedding gowns and I used to watch the birds
feed,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``AMTEX is my canvas. I talk about
nurturing it the same way I used to talk about raising my boys.
This is everything I never thought I'd do.''

   A traditional farm wife and mom, Lois
Schlickau paid her public service dues with the library board and
4-H kids, the Cow-belles and Hereford Auxiliary.
   Now, as the first woman president in the 117-year history of the
Kansas Board of Agriculture, she's a pro at Robert's Rules of Order
and the political sidestep.
   The mother of four children chairs the board responsible for
regulating Kansas' farm industries. It also sets policy for the
state Department of Agriculture and appoints its secretary. Under
Mrs. Schlickau's leadership the board has sponsored seminars for
producers on the Farm Credit System and Latin American debt.
   ``She brings thoroughness, leadership, and credibility to the
post,'' said Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden. ``Lois has been a strong
leader... and she commands respect from throughout the agricultural
community.''
   Mrs. Schlickau cites her partnership with her husband, George,
in running the family's cattle operation, as her training ground
for leadership.
   ``There are a lot of women already involved in ag policy,'' said
Mrs. Schlickau, 55. ``If you really are interested and want to
accept the challenge, the opportunities are there.
   ``Agriculture is changing and we have to be willing to change
with the times. If you stay on the farm you can't be content to
just sit on the tractor, then take your crops in and say, `What
will you give me?' We have to be involved in marketing and
promotion and new ideas.''
   A director and past president of the Kansas Hereford Auxiliary,
director of the Kansas Agri-Women, a member of the Kansas Farm
Bureau, and on the 4-H Advisory Board, she stuck to traditional
female jobs ``because I'm not a woman's libber'' until a friend
suggested she run for the state agriculture board.
   ``I said to him, `You know women don't serve on that board.' But
he told me, `Lois, it doesn't matter whether you're a woman or a
man, you are a capable person,''' she recalled.
   ``So I ran. And I won.''

   The anti-abortion movement won a victory in
the Supreme Court that it may yet come to rue. It could lose in the
legislatures what it won in the court.
   The court gave states additional power to regulate abortion. The
effect was to make abortion a live political issue on which
candidates must take stands and on which voters will make decisions.
   Abortion now could become the sort of ``hot button'' issue that
motivates people to vote on the basis of a candidate's position on
a single issue.
   Until now, people who felt comfortable with the court's Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion had no reason to make a voting
booth decision on that basis. They liked the status quo, and it
didn't appear to be threatened.
   The court's 5-4 decision this summer threatens it. So does the
prospect that Supreme Court decisions in three more abortion cases
next year will permit further restrictions on abortion.
   Political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia,
an expert on campaigns and elections, says he is convinced that the
vast majority of Americans are in neither camp on the abortion
issue and uneasy with both.
   ``People are generally troubled by abortion,'' he says. ``They
find it very unsavory. On the other hand, most people are reluctant
to impose their own moral code on everyone else.''
   The consequence he foresees is that abortion will be tightly
regulated in those states where public opinion is clearly against
it, and loosely regulated in states where it cuts the other way.
   In the battleground states, where opinion is closely divided _
he lists Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Mississippi as among
the key ones _ ``my guess is that they will not regulate abortion
more stringently than now,'' Sabato says.
   A dissenting view comes from Gary Bauer, former domestic policy
adviser to President Reagan, now president of the Family Research
Council, a conservative lobby and think tank.
   Bauer, like Sabato, expects the abortion rights people to get
more involved in politics, but he also expects the anti-abortion
people to increase their political activity. For them, abortion
always was a hot button issue; now the button is hotter.
   Before the court ruled, people opposed to abortion saw Roe vs.
Wade as a fact of life. ``They used to say, `We don't like it, but
what can we do?''' Bauer says.
   Now they know what they can do: elect anti-abortion candidates
to state legislatures.
   Bauer says the new circumstances will make life difficult for
politicians of both parties. But the dilemma, he says, will chiefly
be that of the Democrats.
   The Democratic Party wants to bring back the Northeastern Roman
Catholic voters and Southern Protestant voters who had been wooed
away and now feel comfortable with the Republicans. These folks
oppose abortion and will oppose Democrats who support abortion.
   Sabato doesn't disagree. That's the downside for the Democrats,
he says.
   But now that abortion is a live political issue, it will hurt
Republicans. The GOP's anti-abortion position will drive away
suburbanites and young people, he says.
   Suburbanites and the young have been tilting toward the
Republicans. They are conservative on economic issues and
libertarian _ keep government out of it _ on social issues.
   He expects that the abortion rights forces will grow, that
driving the issue into politics ``will push some people off the
fence and into the pro-choice camp, especially young women who fear
their rights might be infringed on.
   ``When abortion was a theoretical concern it was much more
unsavory than when framed as an individual right that might be
taken away,'' Sabato says.
   So far, the evidence tilts toward Sabato's side of the argument.
   In New Jersey and Virginia, the two states electing governors
this year, the Democratic candidates are putting new emphasis on
their pro-abortion rights stands and the Republican candidates,
Virginia's J. Marshall Coleman and New Jersey's James Courter, have
been waffling on previous hardline, anti-abortion stands. President
Bush, whose 1988 platform took an anti-abortion stand, has been
quiet about abortion since the court ruled.
   But silence won't work, says Deborah Dodson, another student of
abortion politics. She is a senior research associate at the Center
for the American Woman and Politics at New Jersey's Rutgers
University.
   ``I think when politicians have taken a strong, consistent
record on one side or another, they risk losing their activitist
supporters from the side they previously supported while not
appeasing those activitists from the other side,'' says Ms. Dodson.

   School districts out in the country face a
dilemma: declining land values in many rural areas mean lower
property tax receipts, and yet at the same time states mandate
classroom reforms that cost more. In the third part of a series,
``Rural Crossroads,'' AP education writer Lee Mitgang examines
whether reforms are actually reaching rural schoolchildren who've
been labeled ``at risk.''

   Kindergartners at Parkin Elementary School
have a favorite song:
   ``Do you know about scarcity?
   ``Yes we do!
   ``It means you can't have everything you want.''
   This jingle was meant to be a jolly economics lesson for the
6-and-under set. But it also summarizes some sober realities for
the 350-pupil school in a poor, isolated farming community in
northeastern Arkansas.
   The song also aptly describes the fix many rural schools find
themselves in around the country _ at a time when the nation is
clamoring for costly education reforms.
   In recent years, many states have mandated lower class sizes,
tougher teaching standards, additional counselors and expanded
curricula.
   Small districts everywhere, especially in farm states where land
values have declined in the 1980s, say they are being pressed to
the wall to meet such reform demands.
   Furthermore, rural communities like Parkin put the lie to the
long-cherished myth that small schools don't have such social
problems as high dropout and pregnancy rates, drugs and suicides.
   ``Our whole school could be called `at risk,''' said Jeannette
Bennett, principal of Parkin Elementary.
   ``Rural schools across the country have an explosion of `at
risk' kids,'' said Doris Helge, executive director of the National
Rural Small Schools Consortium, which is completing a first-ever
national survey of the social and economic problems rural children
are facing.
   ``In rural communities, you have wonderful, creative people with
wholesome values to help kids. But you don't have the services. You
don't have the community agencies,'' Helge said.
   In one of the few statewide studies ever conducted, Wyoming's
department of education reported in 1987 that up to half the
children in that predominantly rural state could be considered at
risk in terms of dropping out, teen pregnancy, illiteracy, suicide
or crime.
   Bennett said motivating her pupils is her biggest challenge.
   The eventual choices for most of her youngsters _ three-fourths
of whom are black and 90 percent of whom are poor enough to qualify
for free school lunches _ will be whether to continue school or to
leave and eventually go on welfare.
   Life for many of Parkin Elementary's youngsters is so proscribed
that many barely know of Interstate 40, just 11 miles south of
town. Many have never been to Memphis, Tenn., just an hour's drive
away.
   Starting in 1983, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton enacted a series of
education reforms. In a state ranking last, or nearly so, by most
educational measures, Clinton and the Legislature agreed to costly
reforms that mandated, among other things, higher teacher salaries
and many more course requirements.
   All 329 Arkansas districts now teach advanced science, math and
foreign language. Barely half did six years ago. The number of
students taking foreign languages has more than doubled. The
college-going rate increased from 38 percent to 44 percent from
1983 to '87.
   But the clamor for reform placed many small Arkansas districts
like Parkin in a bind.
   Either they must tax their impoverished residents to the limit
to pay for new teachers and tougher standards. Or the state can
force districts unable to meet the standards to merge or
consolidate _ a dreaded step to many rural educators who feel their
smaller schools have priceless virtues.
   Compounding the money woes of such districts, the value of
farmland has declined in recent years. In Parkin, property values
on which school taxes are based declined from $16.3 million in 1986
to $13.9 million in 1988-89. In that period, Parkin raised taxes
twice, but school revenues from all sources still remained
virtually flat: $1.79 million in 1986-87, and a projected $1.72
million in 1989-90.
   Like many isolated districts, Parkin has little or no industry
to bolster the tax base. Townspeople here hope a planned state park
featuring an Indian mound will attract tourist dollars.
   Making matters worse, the Parkin district has been losing
students, a common rural phenomenon as families look for better
opportunities. Average kindergarten-through-12th grade enrollment
in 1984-85 was 928. It declined to 785 in 1988-89. Each lost
student cost the district $1,785 in state aid.
   ``I'm just sitting here,'' said Parkin Superintendent Joseph
``Pete'' Whitby to a visitor, ``figuring out how much money I'm
losing.''
   Still, under Bennett's leadership, Parkin Elementary seems to be
beating the economic odds.
   Among her accomplishments: 94 percent of the school's
third-graders passed the state's basic skills test this year,
compared to 29 percent four years ago.
   One of her teachers, Eda Claire Rucker, has won two national
awards for developing an economics curriculum for third-graders. It
featured lessons about apples, a local commodity.
   ``We planted a tree. We went to an apple orchard. We learned
about taxes. We weighed the apples. We didn't use textbooks. And
that's what the children like,'' she said.
   ``In years gone by, there was no acountability. I think we
should be accountable,'' Bennett said. ``Teachers are made to feel
more a part of a set of goals. We're all in this together. I have a
wonderful staff. It wasn't always so.''
   Teacher salaries top at $19,800, meager even by northeastern
Arkansas standards. But the starting salary of $16,890 is above the
state minimum.
   Thus when Bennett took her post four years ago, she was able to
attract a younger, eager staff of teachers, most of them recent
graduates, whom she could mold into a corps with few bad habits to
break.
   With them, she developed a theme of economics education that now
permeates the curriculum.
   Louise Webb's third-graders, for example, took their shoes off
to see which countries they were made in. The class then graphed
the results _ a lesson that mixed social studies, math and
economics.
   Bennett's philosophy is that economics education is ``even more
basic than reading, writing and arithmetic'' because it teaches
youngsters values, choice and, above all, motivation.
   The school brings in guests to help break down the isolation and
inspire youngsters to achieve.
   Rodney Slater, a black state highway official, addressed an
assembly in the school's cafeteria recently, and was asked by a
fifth-grader if it was possible to advance in his field without
graduating from high school or college.
   Slater, who holds advanced degrees, replied: ``Let me say that
there is no field where you can advance without a degree. Education
is like food. It cannot help you unless you take it in.''

   The traditional role of farm wives is a
laborious, full-time job. One study found that if paid an hourly
wage, they'd make more than their husbands. Now, as AP Mountain
States Regional Reporter Tad Bartimus writes in the final part of a
series, ``Rural Crossroads,'' economic necessity has added a new
pressure for many women: a second job, often far from home.

   Montana farm wife Anne Smith lives 100
miles from home so her teacher's salary can help her husband stay
on his ancestral land.
   Iowa farm wife Denise O'Brien commutes 160 miles a day so her
family can keep its dairy herd and apple orchard.
   The farm crisis of the 1980s has dramatically changed the
traditional role of mothers, wives and daughters in rural America.
   For some, it's an awakening, a chance to carve out a niche. For
others, especially older women without advanced education who must
seek minimum-wage jobs far from home, it is a wrenching separation
from a peaceful lifestyle into rigid routine that has doubled their
workload.
   For generations, farm women were stay-at-home helpmates who
tended gardens, canned food, bottle-fed sick lambs and calves,
supervised 4-H clubs, drove tractors at planting time and trucks at
threshing time, kept the books, and generally provided a second
pair of eyes, ears and hands when husbands needed assistance.
   A study of 330 Nebraska farm women found they spent nearly 68
hours a week at unpaid domestic labor, worked an average of 22
hours a week on farm chores, and spent five hours every week in
volunteer activities.
   The study, completed recently by Wayne State College in
Nebraska, found 37 percent also worked off the farm, earning an
average $160 a week for 30 hours' work.
   The survey concluded that farm women's total work, excluding
volunteer service, is worth an average of $27,446 annually, while
farm men contribute a median of $23,672 in income for labor on and
off the farm.
   Census data indicate that in 1986, 53 percent of all farm women
were in the work force, compared with just under 23 percent in
1960. Of those farm wives working away from home, 78 percent cited
economic reasons for their outside employment, according to a
University of Nebraska study.
   ``I wonder sometimes how long I can keep this up,'' said Ms.
O'Brien, who heads the Rural Women's Leadership Development Project
for Prairiefire, a farm advocacy group based in Des Moines.
   ``I get up with my husband at 5 a.m., do chores, leave home by
6, drive 80 miles to put in a full day here, drive home, do chores,
spend time with the kids, and fall into bed by 10:30,'' said the
39-year-old mother of three.
   ``All of us working off the land are just trying to keep
everything together: bring in money, keep the house clean, keep the
kids involved in activities, pay extra attention to our husbands
because they're having a rough time right now. We're trying to be
everything to everybody. But it's incredibly stressful.''
   Ms. O'Brien and her husband, Larry Harris, have a dairy herd and
grow strawberries and raspberries to sell. Their apple orchard is
about to mature. They have struggled 13 years, sometimes depending
on food stamps for groceries, to make a go of their farm.
   ``We had this dream of farming organically, and my assumption
was that I'd always be farming right next to my husband,'' said Ms.
O'Brien. ``Sometimes, when I have to stay home from work for a day,
and I'm out in the orchard, I get this real longing and I think,
`This is what I intended it to be like.' And I realize that when
I'm home, it depresses me, because that is where I really want to
spend my life, in the orchard, not in Des Moines.''
   Ms. O'Brien, who grew up in Atlantic, Iowa, but had no intention
of staying there until she met her husband, said she believes farm
women are willing to sacrifice their own goals for their mates'
happiness, ``which I guess is very anti-feminist.''
   ``But the question that doesn't seem to be surfacing is, `Is
this worth it or should we get out?' People are avoiding that
issue, especially women, who are by nature protective and
nurturing. We know it's something our husbands want to do, so we
don't think a lot of our own internal goals, we just put up with
the stress,'' said Ms. O'Brien.
   ``I think the couples that confront that issue and talk about it
are on the road to breaking up their marriage.''
   Texas Agriculture Department economist Heather Ball, a farm girl
who left rural Idaho to earn a living in Austin, says: ``America
has lost nearly 600,000 farmers and ranchers since 1981, and today
farmers are going broke at a rate of about 2,500 a week. That
creates heavy stress in rural families.''
   It also creates identity crises in a segment of society where
family roles have always been clearly, even rigidly, defined.
Because the farmer has been the historic breadwinner, having a wife
who brings in most of the money is like having a gorilla at
Thanksgiving dinner: everybody knows it's there but nobody will
acknowledge it.
   A recent seven-state survey of 1,067 farmers and their wives
coordinated by the University of Nebraska found that few wives
believe they can share their stress with their husbands. Less than
one-third said their families are helpful or supportive.
   Anne Smith says she and her husband, Doug, have wrestled with
that crisis ever since she announced five years ago she was going
back to college to get her degree so she could earn extra money.
   ``I'd been commuting 50 miles each way to work (as a secretary)
for $4.36 an hour. Then gas went up so I had to quit,'' said Anne,
31, of Bainville, Mont. ``I wanted to improve our situation, but
Doug fought me tooth and nail. I think he thought he would lose me.
   ``So I did it on my own. My mom and mother-in-law told me the
only jobs for an educated woman around here were teaching or
nursing so I decided to become a teacher. I was tired of being a
peon. I wanted more.
   ``I borrowed money from my mom and went to night school. I did
well, and suddenly Doug became my biggest supporter. That was the
first time I ever stood up to him _ and probably the last. What I
did was not socially acceptable. Everybody assumed I was leaving
Doug. It was real hard on him.''
   Embracing calculus and trigonometry at 26, Mrs. Smith was soon
getting 4.0 grades at Minot State College in North Dakota. But the
separation was wrenching.
   ``There were some bad, bad years there,'' said Doug Smith. In
1980 he bought from his grandmother the land his grandfather had
homesteaded in 1908. ``It was a terrible drought year. In fact,
I've only had one good year, '87, in the last nine.''

   With his wife at school during the week, Smith became a
part-time trucker hauling hay throughout the West. When his wife
graduated in 1987, the couple was optimistic about finally being
reunited when Anne got a teaching job close to home.
   ``But the only job I could get was tending bar in Bainville. My
depression was terrible. I'd spent all this money, Doug was
counting on my extra income, which wasn't there, and then there was
no reward for all the effort.''
   For a year Mrs. Smith searched five counties for a job. Finally,
she heard about an opening in Flaxville, Mont., a town of l50
people 93 miles north of her home, up near the Canadian border.
Competing against dozens of other applicants, she landed the job of
high school math teacher in 1988.
   ``I teach 10 classes and I'm the pep club adviser, cheerleading
adviser, National Honor Society adviser, computer coordinator and
junior class adviser,'' said Mrs. Smith. ``I spend at least three
hours a day preparing for classes, have to be at school at 7:40
a.m., and usually get finished about 11 p.m., because of extra
activities.''
   Monday 'til Friday she lives in a house owned by the school
district, which she shares with the football coach's family.
   ``I enjoy my job, but I want to be closer to home. It's just
that there are no jobs, and when one does open up, there are
literally hundreds of teachers trying to get it,'' said the pretty,
outgoing woman who grew up on a North Dakota farm. ``After college
I swore I'd never be separated from Doug again, but I've done it
because I've had to.
   ``It's been good for our marriage in that it's made us be more
self-reliant, but I get so terribly lonesome. Flaxville's 12 miles
from a movie or a grocery store. Our phone bill is terrible.''
   This year Mrs. Smith bought her first new car, a sports model
her husband describes as ``one of them flashy single-women lookin'
things.'' Come Friday afternoons during the school year, Mrs. Smith
is in it heading home to Bainville.
   ``I never pay attention to the weather. No matter what's
happening, I'm coming home to Doug.''
   Always alert for job possibilities closer to home, Mrs. Smith
isn't optimistic she'll find something soon. She says she'll keep
commuting as long as she has to to keep them on the farm.
   ``I've learned to love this place. This is our dream. If I could
have my wish I'd be home and have a maid to come in and clean my
house and all that ... Then I'd just sit out there on that tractor
all day long. 'Course, I'd have a four-wheel drive tractor. But if
Doug died tomorrow, I'd leave.''

   The granddaughter, daughter, and sister of
lawyers, Annie Debevoise thought she'd take some time off working
in the West before returning to law school in Vermont.
   In 1987, she hired on as a $9,000-a-year organizer with the
Northern Plains Resource Council, a grassroots rural advocacy group
based in Billings, Mont.
   Single at 26, she took a lot of kidding from cowboys and their
wives, who were always trying to fix her up. One day a bunch of
them standing around at the Froid grain elevator dared her to drive
the 16 miles of backroads over to Andy Ostby's house and introduce
herself.
   She did. And now, at 28, she's Mrs. Andy Ostby, ranch wife.
   Instead of learning about torts and statutes, Mrs. Ostby now
knows how to brand cattle, help birth calves, and properly load up
a pack horse.
   There's no vacation in the winter because the cattle have to be
fed, none in the spring because the calves are being born, and no
time off in the summer, either, because the crops have to be
harvested.
   ``Andy's told me we might squeeze in a week in November,'' Mrs.
Ostby said.
   As hundreds of farm women throughout Montana seek employment off
the land to earn extra money, she says she feels lucky to be able
to stay home and learn about her new life.
   ``I take it one day at a time,'' she said, sitting on the porch
of her 37-year-old husband's family home. The house is surrounded
by the rolling green of wheat and grass. Neighbors are out of sight
over the next rise.
   ``I want to learn everything I can, I want to be Andy's partner,
I want to help make this the best ranch it can be.''
   She is a stranger who came into the conservative, slow-to-change
Montana prairie country as an Eastern liberal outsider. She tries
to win acceptance by working hard and keeping quiet.
   She now reads farm journals cover-to-cover. This spring she
bought her own bull.
   ``I was the only woman at the sale. I didn't have any idea how
to load him into the truck, but some of the other ranchers helped
me. When I got home, I figured out how to get him out of the truck
by myself. I'm making progress.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With Pope John Paul II about to depart on yet
another journey, this time to Indonesia and Korea, an AP reporter
who has traveled extensively with the Vatican entourage recalls
some previous papal pilgrimages and describes the logistics
involved.

   For centuries the pope was an Italian who got around
mainly in a chair toted by six other Italians.
   Now Pope John Paul II ranks as the world's number-one
jet-setter, a supersonic pilgrim whose frequent-flyer mileage on
more than 40 journeys outside Italy would take him to the moon and
halfway back.
   Across 400,000 miles in a little over a decade, the pope from
Poland has carried his pastoral cross to 82 countries _ from
Argentina to Zimbabwe, from Tromso, Norway, only l,375 miles from
the North Pole, to Tasmania, at the bottom of Australia, from
ancient Izmir to modern Brasilia.
   British historian Paul Johnson says that in assuming the ``wider
role of high priest of the planet'' John Paul has been seen in
person by ``the largest concentrations of human beings in the
history of the world.''
   No rock group, no politician, no sports star has out-drawn this
former actor with the prizefighter's face, craggy eyebrows and
penetrating blue eyes who has ventured beyond Michelangelo's
magnificent dome to play the Superdome, the Silverdome, the Los
Angeles Coliseum and soccer stadiums, bullrings and race tracks on
six continents.
   Two photojournalists, Luciano Mellace, who has been on all of
John Paul's trips, and Giancarlo Giuliana, who has missed only one,
sometimes argue with the other boys in the back of the Vatican's
chartered jet about the biggest single crowd they ever saw.
   Was it that 200-acre former dueling ground in Dublin's Phoenix
Park carpeted in every direction from the open-air altar with
almost half of Ireland's 4 million population?
   Or that billowing sea of bowing bodies stretching beyond the
reach of their longest lens from the shrine of the Black Madonna at
Jasna Gora in Poland?
   Or those endless files of the faithful marching like armies of
ants up the heights of Santa Anna Mountain after the Polish
government failed to provide the promised buses, canceled trains
and even closed highways?
   Or perhaps the nearly 3 million Mexicans who lined the roads
from the presidential palace to the shrine of Our Lady of
Guadalupe, picking up the paving stones where he passed?
   These days no one around the Vatican seems to know what became
of the sedia gestatoria, the portable throne air-conditioned by
hand-waved flabella, ostrich feathers, that for centuries was the
main mode of papal transport.
   ``Probably in a storeroom at the Vatican Museum,'' ventured
Jesuit Sesto Quercetti, program director of Vatican Radio, who
already is planning the October trip to Indonesia and Korea.
   Others are tutoring the pope in Bahasa, the official language of
Indonesia, preparing cassettes for him to listen to while shaving
or late at night after the last visitor has left.
   At ``total immersion'' lunches they perfect his pronunciation
and go over his speeches the way Swedish Jesuit Lars Rooth coached
him for that June jaunt beyond the Arctic Circle.
   Although Scandinavia's Catholic population of 200,000 adds up to
only a moderate turnout for his noon Sunday blessing in St. Peter's
Square, John Paul added five new languages to his repertoire:
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Icelandic.
   ``As it was for the Twelve Apostles, language is a key tool for
him spreading the message of Jesus,'' Rooth says of this
peripatetic pope who is fluent in nine languages and has preached
in 40 others, including Swahili, Tagolog , Bengali, Huron and
pidgin. ``He has a marvelous ear. Danish and Icelandic are
devilishly difficult.''
   Vaticanisti, the scribes in the baroque press room at the end of
Bernini's columns, knew a rare linguist was in residence in the
third-floor papal apartment when, on the morning after his
election, the pope asked a Swiss guard in German the way to the
elevator, then received the diplomatic corps in faultless French,
conferred with Curia cardinals in perfect Italian, lunched with a
Spanish bishop, dictated letters in English to Fr. John Magee, his
Irish secretary, and at dinner sang sad folk songs with old friends
from the nearby Polish College where he still keeps his guitar and
skis in a closet.
   Several Good Fridays ago, John Paul II quietly relieved a priest
hearing confessions in St. Peter's and for several hours absolved
penitents in Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish and Ukranian. Two months
of intensive study enabled him to answer questions from students on
Japanese TV.
   For months now a team of routing experts at Alitalia's
headquarters in Eur, outside Rome, has been working out details of
the upcoming Asia trip with other national airlines involved and
visiting each country in advance with Vatican officals.
   ``Getting the Holy Father on the road is a full-time job. We
begin planning seven to eight months ahead,'' says Pietro Canale,
director of Alitalia's office of Vatican Relations, who has been
aboard every papal plane since Paul VI went to the Holy Land in
1964. ``Some airlines are very efficient.
   ``The pope is not a very demanding passenger. He has yet to ask
for special treatment or any favorite food. There is no designated
papal jet. We use whichever jumbo is next in rotation. The same
applies to the crew, except an extra officer is added in the
cockpit and to the cabin staff.''
   It now takes but a few hours to re-configure a Boeing 747 for a
papal trip, fitting out the upstairs ``bubble'' with a
curtained-off bedroom, a tiny dining alcove and a small office with
a table and two chairs, then affixing the papal coat of arms to the
right of the door.
   First-class fare is put aboard _ smoked salmon, caviar, beef
Wellington, estate bottled wines _ to be enjoyed mainly by the
journalists and the entourage of cardinals and bishops. The pope
has a robust appetite, but since he was shot in the abdomen during
an assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square in May 198l, he eats
more sparingly.

   On a Quantas flight back to Rome, AP reporter Victor Simpson was
invited to dine with the pope. Simpson eagerly partook of the
lobster cocktail and rack of lamb but noticed that John Paul barely
touched his appetizer and ordered only cauliflower as a main course.
   The Vatican advance team headed by Jesuit Roberto Tucci checks
out lodging, security, emergency medical facilities and sites for
the pontifical Mass and youth rallies.
   The pope always begins his travels on Alitalia, then moves on
aboard the national airline of the country he is leaving. Papal
meandering beyond the major cities to remote villages and ancient
shrines has whitened the knuckles of the Vatican press on a variety
of aircraft _ creaking DC-8s, aging turboprop Fokkers, a crop
duster Polish helicopter, and Soviet-built Tupolevs and Ilyushins,
decorated with a crucifix no doubt for the first time in their
flight logs.
   In April, Air France's Concorde flew the pontiff at Mach 2 speed
l,920 miles across the Indian Ocean from the island of Reunion to
Lusaka, Zambia.
   Vatican baggage master Stefano Falez recently retired with a
record no airline can match. ``We never lost a bag,'' proudly
boasts Falez, who always personally looked after the pastoral
cross. ``It breaks down into three pieces and fits into a case like
a cello. One constant headache was what to do with the gifts given
everywhere to the pope. Often they were disposed of locally to help
the poor.''
   After the assassination attempt, the Vatican acquired for
prepositioning around the world a fleet of Mercedes-Benz
cross-country vehicles equipped with protective plastic windows,
loudspeaker and recorder and quick acceleration in an emergency.
The Mercedes used at Reunion is being shipped to Mauritius for the
Asian trip.
   By all rights of art and ethos, this pope ought to have lived in
the l3th century, the age of the great gothic cathedrals. Then
color slides of his travels could glow in stained-glass glory on
the west facade of Chartres or Rheims:
   _Headhunter tribesmen paddling dugout canoes up the Sepik river
in New Guinea to catch a glimpse of the ``Number One Jesus Man.''
   _Bolivians in bowler hats offering cocaine tea to the pontiff as
a stimulant for the thin air high in the Andes.
   _On the banks of the Boyne, where Protestant William of Orange
triumphed and Oliver Cromwell ordained a never-forgotten slaughter,
the pope on his knees begging the gunmen on both sides of the
Ulster border to ``turn away from paths of violence.''
   _Hastings Kamuzu Banda, in homburg hat and wielding an elephant
tail fly flick, welcoming the pope to Malawi with his personal
troop of dancers whose writhing tutus were emblazoned with
portraits of the president-for-life.
   _An angry pope raising high his pastoral cross before an altar
in Managua, Nicaragua, devoid of a crucifix or effigies of the
saints but decorated with portraits of revolutionary heroes. John
Paul giving his gold ring to the parish priest of a Rio de Janeiro
favela, a shantytown.
   The pope's TV photogenic charm and charisma _ lifting up babies,
strumming a guitar at a youth rally, embracing a priest dying of
AIDS _ often comes as counterpoint to a stern and uncompromising
message of fidelity to traditional church dogma. In his homilies,
40 or 50 a trip, he is unbending in his opposition to divorce,
contraception, homosexuality, married and women priests, Western
materialism and Marxist-tinged liberation theology.
   ``Proclaim the message and, welcome or unwelcome, insist on
it,'' he quotes St. Paul to gatherings of priests and bishops
around the world who often espouse a less-rigid theology.
   The message is not always welcome. There have been hostile
audiences. Protestant firebrand Ian Paisley interrupted his address
to the European parliament to denounce him as ``the anti-Christ.''
San Francisco gays chanted ``Pope go homo.'' A poll of Dutch
Catholics showed only 39 percent welcomed his visit. His image
vanished from Polish TV whenever Solidarity banners came into
camera range. In Managua he thundered ``silencio'' into the
microphone as propaganda loudspeakers tried to drown out his sermon
with Marxist slogans.
   ``Nicaragua is the only government that ever tampered with our
broadcasts,'' says Vatican Radio's Quercetti. ``They even
interposed the national anthem as background to our soundtrack.''
   At 69, John Paul II seems virtually immune to jet lag and as
vigorous as ever, if a bit more stooped and balding. But both
friends and critics are increasingly asking why he journeys on?
   ``Many say the pope travels too much,'' the pontiff acknowledged
in a talk to the Curia, then defended his trips as ``authentic
pilgrimages to the sanctuary of living people of God,'' many of
whom could not afford to come to Rome. Again, he cited his
namesake, St. Paul: ``I love to see you.''
   By ceaseless travel, the first non-Italian pope in 450 years has
made the Church of Rome less Italian and more universal.
   Archbishop John Foley, the Vatican's media chief, summed up the
pope's global mission: ``Essentially it boils down to being clear
on what your message is and then preaching it or selling it, if you
will, to the faithful and those you hope will become the faithful.''
   Those near John Paul say he is convinced the Virgin Mary
miraculously effected his recovery from gunshot wounds that would
have been fatal to others to enable him to perform some as-yet
unknown mission.
   But there is no end in sight for the world weary Vatican press
corps. The word has seeped down the Scala Regia, the staircase
leading to the apostolic palace, that John Paul II has his heart
set on visiting Cuba, the Soviet Union and China.
   ``Chinese is a most difficult language,'' sighs Quercetti,
``even for him.''

   The frequency of John Paul II's journeys and
tightened security have cut down the crowds. The paparazzi, Rome's
aggressive free-lance photographers, no longer book seats on the
papal charter now that the Vatican videotapes all the trips.
   But there has been no letup in the blizzard of souvenir buttons,
T-shirts, key rings, posters, cardboard miters or pope hats and
similar sentimental schlock littering the papal path.
   Dublin vendors hawked ``I Peeked at the Pope'' buttons that also
peeked back from a portrait of John Paul II with eyes that seemed
to move.
   Merchants in Hamtramck, Detroit's Polish neighborhood, offered
papal beer mugs adorned with his familiar profile. Food stalls in
Los Angeles pushed ``pope-corn'' and ``pope-sicles.''
   In Carmel, Calif., John Paul II shared billing with ``Dirty
Harry,'' played by Mayor Clint Eastwood, on a T-shirt lettered in
medieval script, ``Thou Hast Made My Day.''
   The Vatican press in revolution-scarred El Salvador wore
T-shirts emblazoned with the strange device:``No dispare!
Periodista Bendecido Por El Papa'' _ Don't shoot! Journalist
blessed by the pope.
   The pope was welcomed back to his home diocese of Kracow with,
``Witamy, Jan Pawel'' _ welcome John Paul _ buttons that showed him
giving a trendy high five in a choice of Vatican yellow and white
or Communist red and white. Warsaw balconies sprouted squat plaster
statues of the pope that suggested he had put on a few kilos since
going to Rome.
   African mask-makers in Gabon carved amazing likenesses of the
Holy Father.
   Marvel Comics, which gave us Capt. Marvel and Spiderman, had a
winner with a factual, well-drawn ``Life of John Paul II.''
   A London theater impressario took advantage of his visit to
mount a West End production of ``The Goldsmith's Shop,'' a play the
pope wrote just after being elevated to the bishopric.
   In New Orleans, the portable outhouses were dubbed ``vati-cans''
and ``pope johns,'' and a toothless, helmeted gridiron behemoth
grinned from a poster proclaiming, ``The Pope Loves the Saints'' _
the name, of course, of the local pro football team.
   But Miami took the cake in papal schlock with ``Let Us Spray''
lawn sprinkers that asperged the grass with a jet of water from the
fluttering hands of a puppet pope. It was the kind of compulsive
kitsch that the pastor of one parish right along the path of the
popemobile could not resist.

   Before the advent of the popemobile, those specially equipped
cars used by Pope John Paul II, there were the ``Nina,'' the
``Pinta'' and the ``Santa Maria.''
   Those were the nicknames of the flatbed trucks that in January
1979 carried the papal throne, the photographers and a retinue of
bishops who kept sliding about on camp chairs at every sharp curve
in the Dominican Republic, where the pope inaugurated his decade of
globe-trotting by kissing the tarmac.
   A bus with its roof cut off carried Juan Pablo II in Mexico.
Several African nations duded up safari wagons. An oversized

Moslem volunteers in Madagascar turned a rusting pickup into a

   A 10-car papal train, with a vista dome parlor car for Jean Paul

blessings from the bar car.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Five centuries ago, King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella ordered Jews and other non-Catholics to either convert to
Catholicism or get out of Spain. The Inquisition was the brutal
tool to enforce that edict. Jewish leaders in Spain today say that
while overt anti-Semitism is now rare, thanks in part to hard-won
changes in Roman Catholic and lay teachings, a negative image of
Jews lingers among many Spaniards.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first time Samuel Toledano came to
Spain, he attended a clandestine Yom Kippur service in a private
home in Madrid. Forty-five years later, Toledano worships in the
modern Beth Yaacov synagogue and explains Judaism on state-run
television.
   As the 500th anniversary of the 1492 expulsion of Jews
approaches, Spain's small Jewish community has won major battles to
erase the legacy of the Inquisition. Time must do the rest.
   ``It has been a tremendous challenge and satisfaction to
re-create a Jewish life where it has been absent for five
centuries,'' says Toledano, a native of Tangier born into a Jewish
family whose roots were always in Spain. Toledano is the current
president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain.
   Although Spanish Jewish leaders say social and economic
anti-Semitism is virtually non-existent, the negative image of Jews
lingers among today's Spaniards despite hard-won changes in Roman
Catholic and lay teachings.
   ``We are living in times when the youth receive a different
education than in years past. They are no longer being poisoned by
offensive textbooks,'' says Max Mazin, the former president of the
Madrid Jewish Community. ``But it's a question of several
generations, without doubt.''
   In 1962, Toledano and Mazin participated in the revision of
primary and secondary school textbooks in which Jews were portrayed
as betrayers of Spain, at best, and ritual murderers, at worst.
   Riding the tide of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council in which
the Roman Catholic Church publicly expressed regret for past
anti-Semitism, the men obtained official recognition for their
community from the fervently Roman Catholic regime of Gen.
Francisco Franco.
   Mazin, a Soviet-born businessman who came to Spain in 1950,
headed the Jewish community in 1968 when the Franco government
authorized the first new synagogue in Spain since the 14th century
and formally annulled the 1492 edict of expulsion.
   Until then, only private worship of Jewish, Moslem, Protestant
and other non-Catholic rites had been legally tolerated.
   Under Franco, who died in 1975, Spain helped several thousand
Jews escape Nazi persecution, while the dictator himself railed
against ``the Judeo-Masonic-Communist conspiracy.''
   An estimated 12,000 Jews live in Spain, half in Madrid and
Barcelona, the country's two largest cities, according to Toledano.
The country has five full-time rabbis.
   Like Toledano, most of the Jews are nationalized Spaniards who
came here in the 1950's and 1960's from Morocco, where descendants
of Jews expelled from Spain _ known as Sephardim, after the Hebrew
name for Spain _ maintained Jewish-Spanish customs and language.
   Other significant Jewish centers in Spain include the
Mediterranean resort cities of Malaga and Palma, where many members
are northern European retirees, and the Spanish North African
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.
   In March 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella gave Jews and
other non-Catholics four months to leave the country as part of
their design to unify the country under a single religion.
   The August 3 deadline coincided with the day Christopher
Columbus set sail on his first trans-Atlantic voyage, paid for in
part by Jewish financiers.
   For a thousand years before that, the Jews had lived a
flourishing if precarious existence under a succession of Roman,
Visigothic, Islamic and Catholic rulers whom they served as
physicians, ministers, moneylenders and tax collectors.
   The era, called the ``golden age'' by Jewish scholars, also
produced artists and scholars such as Moses Maimonides, a
12th-century physician-philosopher born in Cordoba, and Judah Ha
Levi, the first lyric poet to write in Spanish.
   The first in a series of blows that would prove fatal to Jewish
culture on the Iberian Peninsula was a series of pogroms in 1391
that whittled down Spain's Jewish population by as much as a third,
between deaths, exiles and conversions.
   Ferdinand and Isabella appealed to Pope Sixtus IV for the
creation of a special commission to root out dissidents as they
fought to wrest control of Spain from the Moslems who had ruled
nearly half the country for 800 years.
   Established in 1478, the Inquisition became notorious first for
its forced conversions of Jews and later for its use of torture to
extract confessions from backsliding ``New Christian'' converts to
Catholicism and other supposed heretics.

   Although the Inquisition's power waned over the centuries, it
instilled Spanish society with a fear of impure bloodlines and
non-conformist behavior that lasted long after the last heretic was
handed over to the government for ``relaxation'' at the stake.
   On the Spanish Mediterranean island of Majorca, for example, the
descendants of 15 New Christians who survived a 1691 auto-da-fe, as
acts of public penitence were called, are still singled out as
Jews, despite their centuries of devotion to Catholicism.
   Until the 1950s, people bearing one of these ``Xueta'' surnames
were excluded from certain professions and shunned as unsuitable
marriage partners by their fellow Majorcans.
   Some Spaniards spoke of encouraging Sephardic Jews to return as
early as 1869 when the constitution of the First Republic included
a clause permitting private worship.
   But little came of their efforts until nearly a century later.
   Now, Toledano hopes Sepharad `92, the Socialist government's
planned commemoration of the expulsion, will teach Spaniards about
the largely forgotten role of Jews in the development of Spanish
culture.
   ``There has been a concerted effort to deny the Jewish and
Moslem contribution to Spanish civilization that endures to this
very day,'' Toledano says. ``The attitude toward Jews was based on
ignorance and myth and centuries of teaching by the schools.''
   Activities scheduled for 1992 include the construction of a
monument to multicultural Spain, a traveling exhibition on Jewish
culture, essay contests on Jewish history, the planting of a
biblical garden and seminars in Toledo, once a center of Jewish and
Moslem scholarly life.
   Sepharad `92 has also acted as a springboard for other efforts,
such as the inclusion of a course on the history of Jews in Spain
in high school curricula beginning this fall.
   ``The next step will be to incorporate that course into the
history books,'' Toledano says. ``You have to turn back an attitude
that has endured for centuries by working at the grass-roots
level.''
   Both Toledano and Mazin emphasize that, despite ``mythical''
anti-Semitism, Spaniards rarely express personal prejudice toward
Jews. No Spanish club would ever exclude Jewish members, nor do
businesses shun Jewish partners.
   ``There is less social anti-Semitism here than in any Western
country except Italy,'' Toledo says. ``The fact that you are a Jew
may raise curiosity, but not animosity.''
   But there is still work left to do, Toledano and Mazin say.
   Despite the elimination of many anti-Semitic definitions, the
1984 dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy of Letters still
includes denigrating references to Jews.
   The noun ``judiada,'' derived from the Spanish word for Jew, is
``a bad action...that was considered characteristic of the Jews.''
   Among commonly used Spanish put-downs are ``perro judio''
(Jewish dog) and ``marrano,'' a term deriving from the Castillian
word for swine that once referred to Jews converted to Christianity
and now means any scurrilous or dirty person.
   More troublesome, perhaps, is the constant and repetitive
identification of Jews in the Spanish press, where Dustin Hoffman
is a Jewish actor, France's Jacques Hachuel is a Jewish businessman
and Israeli jets are Jewish warplanes.
   In a recent article in the weekly Epoca about controversial
commodities trader Marc Rich, who gave up his U.S. citizenship to
become a Spaniard, Rich is identified as a Jew no less than six
times.
   The author also notes that Justice Minister Enrique Mugica
Herzog, whose mother is a Jew of Polish descent, ``has Jewish blood
in his veins.'' Mazin, whom the author labels the head of a
``discreet and effective'' Jewish lobby in Spain, is identified
three times as a Jew.
   But Mugica, who is not a practicing Jew, says the labeling of
Jews and other groups in the press is a reflection of poor
journalism and little else.
   ``It's not prejudice. It's simply a lack of intellectual
discipline,'' he says. ``Furthermore, there is a long tradition
here of using religion to camouflage political ambition.
   ``I don't notice any anti-Semitism. There are expressions that
come from the old times. But how are we going to give these
expressions a political meaning?''
   Mazin disagrees.
   ``Once you say, `Jew,' you don't need to say anything else,
because it's such a defining term. You have to point out someone is
a Jew. If you don't, somebody might not know and confide in him and
be betrayed later.''

<DATELINE>PALMA DE MAJORCA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The families of Ramon Aguilo and
Miquel Segura have been churchgoing Roman Catholics for three
centuries, but that didn't stop neighborhood kids from taunting
them as Jews each day on the way to school.
   Since they were old enough to remember, the two men have known
their neighbors viewed them as different.
   Segura and Aguilo are Xuetas, descendants of 15 stigmatized
families who survived a 1691 Spanish Inquisition crackdown against
``lapsed'' Jewish converts to Christianity on this Spanish
Mediterranean island.
   The Xueta (pronounced Chweta) phenomenon is an extreme example
of a Spanish obsession with bloodlines that long outlasted the
Inquisition, a papal commission created in 1478 to root out secret
Jews, Moslems and other heretics.
   The Xueta label has followed the two men into adulthood.
   During a recent labor dispute, striking garbage collectors added
it to the list of insults they hurled at Aguilo, now the mayor of
the capital city of Palma.
   A few years ago, a news article showing the mayor donating blood
carried the caption, ``Xueta blood? No thanks.''
   Majorca's prosperous Jewish community, like those throughout
medieval Spain, ceased to exist in 1492 when King Ferdinand and
Queen Isabella issued an edict that gave Jews the choice of
converting to Catholicism or fleeing the country.
   Jews of Spanish descent began returning to Spain from North
Africa after World War II to join others who had fled Nazi-occupied
Europe. But it wasn't until 1968 that the regime of Gen. Francisco
Franco authorized the construction of a synagogue in Madrid and
formally rescinded the 1492 expulsion edict.
   Since most Spanish Jews changed their surnames when they
converted, it is nearly impossible for modern Spaniards to
determine their origin, although many offhandedly claim some Jewish
ancese
mother is a Jew of Polish origin.
   Samuel Toledano, head of the Federation of Jewish Communities in
Spain, says Spanish Catholics who recognize him from television
appearances often approach him to proclaim their Jewish heritage.
   Israel's first ambassador to Spain, Samuel Haddas, told a
Spanish daily in 1986, ``not a day goes by that I don't get a
letter or phone call from Spaniards asking if their surname is
Jewish.''
   But in Majorca's closed island culture, people with the 15 Xueta
surnames have been singled out since 1691, when a Majorcan priest
published The Triumphant Faith, in which the names appeared.
   Until mass tourism began to dilute the island's culture and
raise educational levels in the 1950s and 1960s, the Xuetas
remained a community apart, ostracized by other Catholics and
steered into certain neighborhoods and professions _ most notably
silversmithing.
   Now, half of Majorca's 600,000 residents are new to the island.
There are no reliable figures on the number of Xuetas, but Segura
estimates there are between 15,000 and 30,000 on Majorca.
   Few Xuetas still live on the Street of the Silver Shops, once
the center of their neighborhood, although many of the stores still
bear Xueta names.
   Aguilo, 39, and Segura, 44, say they belong to a transitional
generation _free of institutional anti-Xueta prejudices but
subjected to verbal abuse from their childhood peers.
   ``The city has pretty much overcome this type of racism. But
certain latent tendencies still exist, despite the growth of
tourism,'' says Aguilo, an agnostic.
   Segura, the head of the local jewelers' and silversmiths' guild,
wears a heavy gold pendant showing a seven-branched Jewish menorah
or candelabra and the Majorcan coat of arms as a symbol of pride.
He says his children are generally unaffected by any lingering
prejudice.
   Both are careful to point out that unlike the Spanish mainland,
where centuries of anti-Jewish religious teachings and a physical
absence of Jews gave anti-Semitism a nebulous quality, anti-Xueta
feelings on Majorca were directed at real people.
   Descendants of other converts gradually integrated into Majorcan
society, their origin forgotten, and the Xueta surnames carry no
stigma on the Spanish mainland.
   ``This has nothing to do with the peninsula. It is an island
issue, prolonged by the insularity of Majorca,'' Segura says.
   ``What existed here was not a historic or mythical prejudice. It
was a real, live hatred _ it wasn't even aimed at Jews, but rather
at Xuetas.''
   ``Here, religious prejudices became racial ones,'' Aguilo says.
``The Xuetas are as Catholic as anybody else. To avoid suspicion
they were even more observant in public than others.''
   Over the past 25 years, a few Xuetas have had an opposite
reaction, converting to Judaism and moving to Israel.
   There are no Xuetas among today's practicing Jewish community
here. Most of its 160 members are northern European retirees.
   They conduct their Friday night services in Hebrew and English
at a 2-year-old synagogue tucked behind a high-rise Palma hotel,
and depend on members or visiting clergymen to conduct services.
   Jewish community president Henry Greenberg says he has seen
little evidence of anti-Semitism on the island.
   ``Majorca is free of anti-Semitism except for a few youngsters
who smear paint on the walls,'' says the British retiree. ``The
Roman Catholic bishop helped inaugurate our synagogue. Basically,
it's a wonderful environment.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The 40th anniversary of the death of ``Gone With
the Wind'' author Margaret Mitchell is likely to go largely
unnoticed in Atlanta this week, but a celebration is in the works
for December, marking the 50th anniversary of the debut of the
film. Meanwhile, those who knew her are waiting curiously for the
publication of a GWTW sequel, something Miss Mitchell herself had
opposed.

   A tourist in search of Margaret Mitchell's roots
would have a hard time finding them 40 years after the author of
``Gone With the Wind'' died in her beloved Atlanta.
   Frankly, she would have liked it that way.
   Miss Mitchell, known for her love of privacy, wanted her
childhood home destroyed so no one could turn it into a shrine. Her
wishes were followed, and her hometown still has few physical
reminders of its most-famous writer.
   The same passion for privacy was evident in August 1949, when
Miss Mitchell died after being struck by a speeding car on
Peachtree Street.
   Her funeral on Aug. 18 was open to 350 relatives and friends who
received printed invitations. It was a nine-minute service followed
by a brief graveside ceremony, and the family declined flowers
except for a blanket of blossoms that covered the top of her casket.
   The author's brother, Stephens Mitchell, ``wanted to make sure
the thing was held in good taste, not...some sort of circus,'' said
his son, Gene, who now lives in Michigan.
   But Atlantans, shocked by the death of the woman they knew
affectionately as Peggy, would not be denied the chance to pay
their last respects.
   Crowds stood outside the funeral home, waiting with reporters in
the heat to hear the service on loudspeakers. Others stood with
heads bowed as the cortege wound its way to Oakland Cemetery, where
Miss Mitchell was buried beside her parents in a grave marked with
a simple marble headstone.
   There had been crowds, too, at Grady Hospital, where Miss
Mitchell lay in a coma for five days after the Aug. 11 accident.
Curiosity seekers and fans descended on the hospital, and family
friends volunteered to help answer the hundreds of telephone calls
seeking news of her condition.
   Nancy Wooten, a retired nurse who worked at Grady during Miss
Mitchell's final days, recalled that the windows in her room were
kept tightly closed for privacy despite the August heat and the
lack of air conditioning.
   ``We had to go outside to an old icehouse and bring buckets of
ice in'' to help cool the room, she said.
   When Miss Mitchell died on Aug. 16, at the age of 48, there were
messages of condolence from around the world.
   ``The city was certainly struck by it,'' recalls Celestine
Sibley, a friend of the author who kept vigil at the hospital as a
reporter for The Atlanta Constitution. ``People felt a tremendous
sense of personal loss.''
   Public sentiment was strong against Hugh Dorsey Gravitt, the
29-year-old off-duty taxi driver who was driving the car that
struck Miss Mitchell. Gravitt was charged with murder, but was
convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served less than a year
in prison.
   Gravitt, now retired and living about 30 miles east of Atlanta
in Covington, refuses to discuss Miss Mitchell's death.
   ``I paid my debt 40 years ago, but people just won't leave me
alone,'' he said in a brief telephone interview.
   Ms. Sibley, who still works for the Constitution as a columnist,
contends that Gravitt was unfairly portrayed as a heartless killer.
   ``He was the opposite _ grief-stricken,'' she says.
   Miss Mitchell and her husband, John Marsh, were on their way to
see a movie the night she was injured. They were crossing Peachtree
Street to get to the theater when Gravitt sped around a curve
toward them. Marsh stepped forward and survived, but his wife tried
to make it back to the curb and was hit as Gravitt's car went into
a long skid.

   Marsh, who had suffered from heart problems, lived less than
three years after his wife died. Because the Marshes had no
children, the rights to ``Gone With the Wind'' went to Stephens
Mitchell, who died in 1983.
   Today all ``Gone With the Wind'' royalties belong to his two
sons, Gene and Joe, although the rights to the book are in the
hands of an administrative committee of three Atlanta lawyers. The
committee, which is self-appointing, is to exist as long as there
is business generated by ``Gone With the Wind.''
   Margaret Mitchell, born in Atlanta in 1900, took nearly 10 years
to write her famous book, the only one she ever published. A former
reporter for The Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine, she based her
1,037-page novel on the Civil War stories she heard as a child from
those who lived through the war and Reconstruction.
   Prior to ``Gone With the Wind,'' Peggy Mitchell Marsh was known
to her friends as a petite, fun-loving and often irreverent
socialite who loved to give parties for journalists and Atlanta's
literary crowd.
   Some of them knew she was working on a book, keeping the
manuscript in a growing pile of manila envelopes in the living room
of her apartment, but she refused to talk about it.
   ``We all wondered what Peggy's book was going to be about,''
recalls Yolande Gwin, a retired society writer for the Constitution.
   The 1936 publication of the novel, which won a Pulitzer Prize
the next year, placed Miss Mitchell and her husband, a Georgia
Power Co. executive, squarely in an unwelcome spotlight.
   ``I am sure Scarlett O'Hara never struggled harder to get out of
Atlanta or suffered more during the siege of Atlanta than I have
suffered during the siege that has been on since publication day,''
she wrote in July 1936.
   It was her desire to keep her private life private that prompted
Miss Mitchell to ask her brother to have their childhood home razed
after he no longer had use for it. The house was torn down in the
1950s, but its site is marked with a plaque placed by the Georgia
Historical Commission.
   Another GWTW landmark _ the Loew's Grand Theater, where the film
based on her book had its gala premiere in 1939 _ was gutted by
fire in 1978 and has been replaced by an office tower. Its site
also is marked with a plaque.
   Atlanta has a Margaret Mitchell Court, Margaret Mitchell Drive,
Margaret Mitchell Square and Margaret Mitchell Elementary School,
plus a handful of library exhibits about her life and work.
   But efforts to establish a Mitchell museum in Atlanta or nearby
Clayton County, where her fictional plantation Tara was set, have
so far been as unsuccessful as the Confederate cause. The latest _
a campaign to save ``The Dump,'' the apartment building where she
wrote much of the book _ has been tied up in court since early last
year.
   The anniversary of Miss Mitchell's death this year may go
largely unnoticed, but a celebration is in the works for December,
the 50th anniversary of the film's debut.
   Meanwhile, those who knew her are waiting curiously for the
publication of a ``Gone With the Wind'' sequel, something Miss
Mitchell herself had opposed.
   Stephens Mitchell opposed it too. But shortly before his death,
he authorized attorneys to go ahead with the sequel, knowing that a
flood of unauthorized versions was likely as soon as the copyright
on his sister's book expired in 2011.
   A Virginia author, Alexandra Ripley, was chosen to write the
sequel, which is due out next year.
   In a 1988 interview, Ms. Ripley acknowledged that Margaret
Mitchell fans are likely to view her efforts critically.
   ``This one will never be mine,'' she said. ``It's a foster
mother kind of thing. I am trying to prepare myself for a universal
hatred of what I'm going to do.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a town where the likes of Thomas Alva Edison
and Guglielmo Marconi once worked, a town that helped perfect the
radio and was home to New York's first regularly licensed radio
station, the message is the medium. Just ask members of the Antique
Radio Club in Schenectady, N.Y., one of about 30 such groups around
the world.

<DATELINE>SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The members of the Antique Radio Club
aren't very impressed with a fancy computer during ``Show and
Tell,'' even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher Morse code at
the speed of light.
   But when someone starts passing around a set of stained,
yellowed photographs from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's first
amateur radio stations, a buzz of animated conversation fills the
cramped basement where they are meeting.
   This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, most
considerably advanced in age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing the
pictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his brow and smiles.
   ``Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, the
guy next door is a radio ham,'' Baker says. ``We used to try to
hang around him because we were interested in that kind of stuff.''
   The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads.
They've obviously come here to ``get together with the other guys
and see what they got and talk,'' as one member says.
   The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-based
Antique Wireless Association, is one of about 30 scattered around
the world, according to Bruce Kelley, the curator of the
association's museum. All together, there are about 10,000 antique
or historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and of
those 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to
transmit on the rare radios, Kelley says.
   However, there's something about the Schenectady organization
that suggests it's kind of special.
   ``I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him,'' blurts out
Robert Thayer, 73, referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemist
Irving Langmuir. ``I put round knobs on the thing and he went
crazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted a pointer on there
and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. He
didn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where that
pointer was!''
   The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era
half a century ago when Schenectady, then home to the General
Electric and American Locomotive companies, unabashedly called
itself ``the city that hauls and lights the world.''
   They talk excitedly about an ``intellectualism'' that once
permeated the ``Electric City,'' located on the banks of the Mohawk
River 15 miles northwest of Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started it
all when he established his machine works in 1886, they say. Six
years later, the two nondescript brick buildings would become GE.
   Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose of
self-respect into a town that had too often been the butt of cruel
jokes. The thankfully forgotten song, ``I Can't Spell
Schenectady,'' didn't seem fair to a thriving metropolis that had a
lively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry that
included scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi.
   ``Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One of
the nicest cities in the country,'' boasted club chairman Fay
Eckert. ``Well, they had the Erie Canal here for one thing, up to a
point, anyway, which made it interesting. And it was such a clean
city.''
   But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio production
business after World War II, quickly reducing its work force in
Schenectady from a wartime high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of the
folks swapping memories at this reunion were among those thousands
laid off.
   Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coup
de grace to what had been a long downward spiral.
   ``Now, nobody comes to Schenectady anymore,'' grumbles Francis
Emrich, a private radio operator for 42 years.
   Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: ``When I was a
young man, everybody got out of college, went down to GE and got a
job in the testing department.''
   That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GE
in 1940, earning 35 cents an hour on an assembly line.
   This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radio
technology, Emrich remembers. The city's skyline bristled with the
antennae of ``hm'' radio operators. As a matter of fact, Emrich
says, GE used to give away tubes and other paraphernalia to hams,
until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the stuff.
   Emrich's a purist, which means he won't use anything but genuine
parts in his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's had
to search in some pretty odd places for spare parts.
   It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularly
licensed radio station, WGY, which first broadcast in February
1922, was started by GE in Schenectady. Television, also largely
developed by GE, soon followed in 1939. If necessity was the mother
of invention, then GE was the doctor who performed the delivery.
   ``One thing about GE, their minds were always working down there
to improve things,'' Emrich says.
   Jack Nelson, considered the club's patriarch because he reported
to work for GE back in 1928, stands up to announce that the widow
of a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale. Lots
of old radio equipment will be available.
   The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore
are becoming scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps in
his cluttered cellar. Or the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming Ed
Farrell showed off in the back of his van at the club's flea market
before the meeting.
   ``The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildly
interested in radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones
and some wire and make it work,'' says Thayer, his fingers wrapped
around an odd-looking 1936 GE metal tube that he uses as a gavel.
``Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to
be terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start with
a simple thing and work up.''
   Radios, especially antique ones, are fetching high prices also,
so much so that Eckert now calls collecting ``a rich man's hobby.''
   He leaps at the chance to give an example: A 25-tube Zenith
Stratosphere from 1939, a luxury radio that stands 5-feet tall and
probably cost $900 then, was recently auctioned for $8,000 in
Georgia.
   Eckert's own 33-tube E.H. Scott radio from 1940-41, which he
calls the ``Rolls Royce'' of radios, fetched a price of $350 back
then and now is worth about $750.
   ``But,'' he admits, ``it's not in mint condition.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Soviet violinist Nina Beilina, who will be
touring South America for a month starting Aug. 20, has spent a
dozen frustrating years trying to get her career off the ground in
the United States. Though the critics acclaim her artistry, she has
found that playing well is not always enough in a free enterprise
system. But finally she feels her star is on the rise.

   They sing of this town, ``if you can make it
there, you can make it anywhere.'' But if you are a Soviet artist,
dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov notwithstanding, it isn't easy.
   Nina Beilina, winner in three violin competitions and acclaimed
for her playing in the Soviet Union, gave a recital in December at
Lincoln Center that was favorably received.
   But she's been at it in New York for a dozen years and only now
does she feel her career is in the ascendancy.
   She has managed to make ends meet, mainly by touring in Europe,
South America and South Africa. She also teaches, though previously
with a sinking feeling that her career was going nowhere. Looking
back, she knows that she made mistakes.
   In the Soviet Union, artists are more protected. A state agency
books their performances, keeps them at work.
   But Soviet artists, newly arrived in America, may find their
reputations unknown. Then they have to find a booking agency and
make decisions without family, friends or trusted advisers. Add to
that an unfamiliar language and culture shock.
   ``It was just an incredible battle for a woman alone,'' she
says. ``I came with only a library collected by me and my husband _
books and music scores. I feel if I play well, that's all it takes.
Of course it's not enough.''
   When despair threatened, music saved her. She practiced Bach.
   ``It was my refuge. Bach for me is like a priest to whom I go
and talk. Just to touch the music is such happiness for me.''
   It's through Bach that her career is now building.
   ``A woman who runs the free concerts at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine heard me play,'' she says. ``She said I play Bach a
special way and I should make a festival from January through May
last year. From my students I created an orchestra. I conducted. My
son played the double violin things with me. In six concerts, we
had 15,000 people.
   ``I played all that Bach wrote for violin. It was my husband's
wish. In Russia I did part of this, with harpsichord and organ.
Here I had a chance to do even more.''
   This year, Miss Beilina was asked to organize four Bach concerts
at another church. She was invited to establish a Bach festival
near Rome June 8-15, taking 15 musicians with her. After that, she
and her violinist son performed at a baroque festival in Italy. The
15-member group will tour in South America for a month starting
Aug. 20.
   In April she played the Shostakovich violin sonata with Soviet
composer Boris Tischenko at New York University. ``It's without
money,'' she says, ``but I feel very good. You cannot live your
life only for how much money you earn. To play with a good pianist
who understands Shostakovich is very dear to me. It could happen
that he would write something for me.''
   In the Soviet Union, after she married conductor Israel
Chuydnovsky, the authorities based him in Leningrad and her in
Moscow. They commuted to be together.
   Even when she was traveling, pregnant with Emile, now a
sophomore on scholarship at Yale studying violin, Miss Beilina
recalls those days as her happiest.
   Fond of the idea of Disneyland, they nicknamed their son Mickey.
Before Mickey was 2, his father died of cancer. Miss Beilina's
Soviet concerts thereafter were in towns, not cities. Her touring
was restricted to South America and Eastern Europe. In 1976, when
Mickey was 6, she applied, successfully, to emigrate.
   In Rome they shared an apartment with another family. After a
day doing laundry by hand in cold water because she had no money
for hot, she ran into a friend of her husband's. He introduced her
to a priest who moved mother and son into their own apartment and
rerouted her from her intended destination, Canada, to New York.
   In New York she chose not to join an enclave of Soviet emigres
in Queens. She moved into a then-new apartment house for artists in
Manhattan, with rent one-third of income, where she still lives.
   ``It was great luck to be accepted in this building,'' she says.
``The apartment was empty. We had just books in big containers. We
slept on a rug. When he was asleep, I was crying. When he was
awake, I tried to be cheerful.

   ``In Russia, I had a nanny for my son. My brother-in-law and
friends helped me. Here I had 1,000 things to put through my head.''
   Miss Beilina's first New York stop was a hotel. A woman offered
to be her amateur manager. ``She took us to lunch and was kind to
us.''
   The violinist's South American manager arranged an audition for
ICM Artists, after which that big management company took her on
its roster. The amateur manager remained her personal
representative. ``She worked with me inside ICM. I didn't speak
much English. I didn't understand many things.''
   The New York Times' chief music critic, Harold Schoenberg, wrote
of her January 1978 New York debut: ``Her playing leans more to the
(Joseph) Szigeti kind of musical approach. Her playing is noble and
even austere; and she has more control over bow and finger than
Szigeti ever did.''
   The critic concluded his notice with a prediction, ``A violinist
of Miss Beilina's formidable powers will not be an unknown for
long. We will be encountering her many times in the future _ on the
concert stage and with orchestra. Russia's loss is our gain.''
   It hasn't happened.
   ``I had only five concerts for the next year,'' she says. ``Now
I know that it takes at least two years to build up. In Russia,
they could book you for the next day.''
   The woman who befriended her told Miss Beilina that ICM's
violinists, including Isaac Stern, all had Israel connections.
``She said I wouldn't be in a good position because I didn't
emigrate to Israel.'' Taking the woman's advice, she left ICM and
went to another agency. Now she considers it her biggest mistake.
   That agency, owned by Europeans, booked her in Europe and South
Africa. ``I had to go to South Africa, for the money. I never had
to be a waitress. I never ask anybody to give me money. I'm not
materialistic. I can live with little money.
   ``But I didn't have any feeling that everything will be all
right.''
   Her playing suffered. ``I got more and more upset. It doesn't
mean I go very low. I found it very difficult to really be on top.''
   A ``comeback'' concert in 1984 was described in The New York
Times as coming ``after a period of what might be called
professional instability'' and continued, ``She should never have
had to come back; hers is the kind of solid violinistic talent that
ought to be heard on a regular basis.''
   Mstislov Rostropovich recommended that another agency take her.
In three years it got her only five concerts. ``I was living on
re-engagements, Italy, Germany, South America, South Africa,
Miami,'' she says. One of her first American engagements was
playing Beethoven in Miami. ``Places where I played once, I got
re-engagements one year after another.'' Last fall, she switched to
manager Norman Gladney.
   In March, between performances in Germany and for the first time
in 12 years, Miss Beilina visited her native country. She played
music one evening in a former church, now a recital hall. ``Without
any publicity, it was full. I felt many people remember me and love
me, so that was very emotional also.''
   Raising Mickey alone wasn't always easy or smooth but now mother
and son are friends and colleagues. ``He was too fresh in school,''
she says. ``He was expelled from one school. Now I feel I'm a
winner because he is in Yale.
   ``This is the first year I could do my work without having to
cook for him every day. Before, I was not able to play chamber
music enough. This year is productive and different. I begin to
play everything possible _ quartets and with piano.''
   The two Bach festivals in churches here didn't pay, but the one
in Italy does.
   One thing is leading to another and Miss Beilina feels, at last,
that her career is on the rise.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A controversial method of preventing beach

   To some waterfront property owners on
the Great Lakes, Dick Holmberg is a savior of shorelines.
   To some government officials, he is a nuisance making a lot of
money at the expense of desperate homeowners willing to try his
method of preventing beach erosion.
   The state of Michigan is footing the bill to find out who's
right.
   The battleground is at the base of a deteriorating 60-foot bluff
on Lake Michigan in this Allegan County tourist town.
   Lakeshore Drive, a scenic stretch atop the dune, has crumbled as
the turbulent lake chews up the supporting bluff. Parts of the
two-lane road, which is lined with summer homes, have been closed
or reduced to one lane.
   What to do about the quarter-mile stretch of shrinking beach
represents only a small part of the controversy confronting
scientists, government officials and communities as they seek ways
to save the shorelines disappearing into our seas and the Great
Lakes.
   Holmberg, a self-described geomorphologist without a degree,
claims he has found a solution.
   He has found his believers in some satisfied customers and some
state lawmakers who have authorized about $300,000 from the state
budget for a pilot project of his patented ``Undercurrent
Stabilizer System.''
   Holmberg, who heads Erosion Control Systems Inc. of Whitehall,
has installed the system here, and will put it next at East Tawas
on Lake Huron and possibly one other test site.
   Western Michigan University will monitor the systems'
effectiveness.
   ``There are those who believe Dick Holmberg's techniques are a
godsend, and then there are those who think he's a fake,'' says
state Sen. Phil Arthurhultz of Whitehall, who authorized the
release of the funds. ``But if there's a method out there that can
protect our existing shoreline or expand it, we are negligent if we
are not employing it to the maximum.
   ``If the study says it doesn't work, then at worst it will have
served as a form of consumer protection.''
   Most coastal engineers believe shoreline erosion is a natural
process and advocate tougher setback laws and the pumping of
dredged sand to replenish beaches.
   But Holmberg blames governmental dredging of navigational inlets
and construction of piers for erosion because they divert offshore
the natural sand-laden nearshore currents.
   Beach nourishment is a temporary, costly solution, and setback
laws ``simply mean that we're banning the shoreline, just running
from it,'' Holmberg says.
   Holmberg's devices consist of concrete-injected geotextile bags
installed perpendicularly to the shoreline at regular intervals,
extending 150 feet into the lake.
   He says they act as underwater speed bumps, elevating and
slowing the currents. The suspended sand precipitates and is
deposited on the shoreline. Within two to four years, the bags are
covered by sand. The system costs $200 to $1,000 per foot of
shoreline.
   Traditional hard structures such as seawalls and rock revetments
only reflect wave energy seaward and increase nearshore turbulence,
Holmberg says. The key, he says, is to work with the forces of
nature, not against them.
   Holmberg, a burly 52-year-old who installs every system himself,
has constructed hundreds for private property owners in the past
decade.
   He contends he has been tangled in bureaucratic red tape because
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state Department of Natural
Resources have conspired against him by restricting his permits.
   ``It's all about egos and power,'' Holmberg says. ``I've taken a
different path and even though they know my system works, they've
chosen to ignore me.''
   Moreover, Holmberg contends government officials don't want to
preserve the shorelines.
   ``They want to get rid of beaches because beaches are shallow
water zones and you can't build a pier in a shallow water zone,''
he says.
   Government officials scoff at those allegations.
   ``Mr. Holmberg is upset because he feels we are not doing enough
to promote his product,'' says Martin Jannereth of the DNR's Land
and Water Management Division.
   Jannereth and other government officials say Holmberg never has
documented fully his system's effectiveness and that any apparent
successes probably result from fluctuating lake levels.
   Holmberg, however, presents 10-inch-thick albums with dramatic
before-and-after photographs and says he has presented mounds of
data, only to be ignored.
   A Holmberg system was installed at the New Buffalo summer home
of Thomas Rehwaldt in 1986, a month before Lake Michigan reached
its record-high levels.
   ``Even as the water got higher, I began seeing beach almost
immediately,'' says Rehwaldt, who paid $21,000 for the system.
   Today, Rehwaldt has 120 feet of beach outside his home. Before
the system was installed, part of his back yard had been swallowed
by the lake.
   The state Department of Transportation last year funded three
Holmberg installations near threatened roads in Charlevoix in
northeastern lower Michigan. So far, they are pleased with the
results, DOT Engineer Thomas Coleman says.
   At the Saugatuck site, homeowners approved the project in hopes
their road, and their property values, will be restored.
   But many coastal engineers say Holmberg's techniques are nothing
but variations on a groin, a shore-attached structure that runs
perpendicularly to the shoreline.
   ``What gets me is that his techniques are nothing new _ they're
decades old,'' says William Wood, director of the Great Lakes
Coastal Research Laboratory at Purdue University. ``He isn't doing
anything dishonest, but he's misrepresenting.''
   Wood says he examined a system Holmberg installed at Ogden
Dunes, Ind., in early 1985 and found that the stabilizers did lead
to an expansion of homeowners' beach _ but at the expense of their
neighbors to the south.
   ``Where do you think the sand comes from?'' Wood asks.
   Holmberg denies that his structures adversely affect nearby
beaches.
   Wood also says the bags holding the concrete have ripped and
pieces of concrete have broken off, creating an eyesore and
potential hazard.
   In Florida, Holmberg was accused of violating DNR permits while
installing a system at Captiva Island in 1979, officials there say.
Though Holmberg claims the project was successful, a government
report by a coastal engineering consulting firm was inconclusive.
   Some East Coast states have banned the use of hard structures
altogether, and Orrin H. Pilkey, a Duke University geology
professor who heads a shoreline protection program, says he was
amazed taxpayers' money was being used for a Holmberg project.
   ``All it is is hard stabilization with a snazzy name,'' Pilkey
says.

   Robert Hays says the idea behind his new NBC
summer series ``FM,'' which will be televised for the first time
this week, was to do a comedy about a young man and his problems
with women.
   The show is set against the background of a listener-supported
radio station in Washington, D.C.
   Hays, who starred in ``Airplane'' and the ABC series
``Starman,'' plays the program director and on-air personality at
the small station. The frenetic pace of the job forces him to
postpone many decisions affecting his personal life.
   ``He has a problem making a commitment,'' says Hays, ``and when
a woman gets too close he gets scared. Yet, he's surrounded by
women. His ex-wife, his teen-age daughter, his attractive new
assistant, his boss and others, as well as a fan named Misty who
keeps asking him to play `Laura.'
   ``He hires his ex-wife to come back and liven up an opinion
show. Ever since she'd left, the conservative had carried on alone
and it was so dull. His ex-wife gets jealous when he hires a pretty
new assistant.''
   Besides the women in his life, co-creators and executive
producers Allan Burns and Dan Wilcox mine the eccentric and
opinionated volunteers who work at the station.
   ``FM'' is scheduled to debut this Thursday behind ``Cheers'' and
in place of ``Dear John.'' The following week it moves to its
regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. for four additional
episodes. It had been a pilot for the fall season.
   The show also stars Patricia Richardson as his former wife,
DeLane Matthews as his assistant, Nicole Huntington as his daughter
and Lynne Thigpen as his station boss.
   The series began when Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC
Entertainment, suggested that Burns write a show about a man and
his problems with women.
   ``There have been shows about women and their problems with
men,'' says Hays. ``Then Brandon said he wanted Robert Hays. At
that time I was looking at things and had something I really wanted
to do but the script was not quite right. I read the script for
`FM' and it was good and funny.
   ``I thought, `Oh, boy, why does this have to happen?' You decide
on something and another show comes along. But `FM' was in shape
and I said I'd do it. We did the pilot and when it wasn't picked we
thought that was the end of it.''
   Hays describes his character, Ted Costas, as a likable guy who
has major responsibilities at the station but gets a small salary.
``He does it because he loves it,'' he says. ``He loves the freedom
he has.''
   Hays starred with Donna Pescow in ``Angie'' on ABC in 1979-80,
then went on to such movies as ``Airplane,'' ``Take This Job and
Shove It!,'' ``Airplane II,'' ``Trenchcoat,'' ``Scandalous'' and
``Cat's Eye.'' He was in such TV ventures as ``California Gold
Rush,'' ``The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything'' and a live
dramatic production of ``Mr. Roberts.''
   His last series was ABC's ``Starman'' in 1986-87, based on the
hit movie. He played an alien who returned to Earth to find his son
and was forced to stay one jump ahead of government scientists.
   He also appeared in a production of ``Teahouse of the August
Moon'' at the Burt Reynolds Theater in Florida.
   Hays, currently in production for the new series, is just back
from doing a movie in Spain. He co-starred with Kim Cattrell in
``For Better or Worse,'' which he calls a ``romantic comedy,
adventure and murder mystery.''
   ``Kim and I meet in a library and it's kind of love at first
sight,'' he says. ``She's a travel agent. I can't wait to call her.
Next thing you know we're married and I don't yet know her travel
agency is a front for the CIA.
   ``On our honeymoon in Spain someone slips a couple of million
bucks into her suitcase. We keep getting into trouble and I have no
idea why.''
   Following ``Starman,'' Hays says he was not in a hurry to get
back into television.
   ``I just didn't have a strong desire to do anything that wasn't
fun,'' he says. ``Fortunately, I didn't have to get back to work. I
had the liberty of being able to wait.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Guerrillas Scoff at Military Claim of Turning War's Tide</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An AK-47 automatic rifle
slung across his back, Luis smiles beneath his bushy black mustache
at the Salvadoran army's claim that the tide has been turned
against anti-government guerrillas.
   ``The military analyzes the war mechanically,'' said the
guerrilla commander at his mountainside command post here.
``Because such-and-such a detachment carried out 40 patrols last
month and 45 patrols this month, they're supposedly winning the war.
   ``But we're not schematic. We can slow down the military rhythm
at times to concentrate on organization and political work. So when
the crucial moment arrives, we're ready.''
   At the age of 30, Luis is a 10-year veteran of the civil war.
   The armed forces and the U.S. government, which foots the bills,
say professionalization and tactical reform of El Salvador's
military _ combined with the ``strategic bankruptcy'' of the
insurgent army _ have provided a light at the end of the long
tunnel of civil war.
   The conflict has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them
civilians. The leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
or FMLN, says it is fighting to do away with what it calls an
``oligarchic'' system that has enriched a few while leaving the
vast majority of Salvadorans destitute.
   The rebels also say they want to end what they consider U.S.
domination of their country.
   El Salvador's military command and U.S. Embassy point out that
FMLN forces have not scored a resounding military success, such as
the overrunning of a brigade, in two years.
   Even so, combat continues daily in the countryside. The rebels
have also struck in the capital and they have acquired new weapons
to counter the government's air power _ its single biggest tactical
advantage.
   By the government's count, its forces suffered a 40 percent
increase in casualties in the 12 months ending May 31, compared
with the previous year. Casualties inflicted on rebel forces were
up 47 percent, according to the Defense Ministry in San Salvador.
   The government has 56,000 men in three military branches and the
militarized police forces. It has 72 helicopters and 63 fixed-wing
aircraft _ A-37 fighter-bombers and O-2 reconnaissance planes. The
military receives $85 million annually from the United States.
   The FMLN has about 7,000 combatants, down from 12,000 early in
the decade but stable since about 1986, according to U.S. and
Salvadoran figures. It relies heavily on ``popular armament'' _
mines, mortars, bombs and grenades devised of homemade explosives,
scrap metal, nails, tape, twine and burlap.
   The rebels reportedly get some arms from Nicaragua and Cuba and
receive some money from Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
They also receive money from so-called ``solidarity groups'' in the
United States and Western Europe.
   Despite the disparity in forces and resources, the army has been
unable to defeat the rebels or erode their base of logistical
support in up to a third of the country _ although the rebels have
also been unable to expand.
   ``Everybody except the army knows where we are,'' chuckled Luis,
welcoming two foreign journalists who hiked up this mountain 60
miles east of San Salvador, pausing to ask peasants the whereabouts
of ``the boys,'' as the rebels are known in the countryside.
   Five mid-level commanders of the Southeastern Front were on
Cerro del Tigre (Tiger Mountain) for a two-day session on strategy,
achievements and shortcomings.
   The first night saw rebel forces harass army positions in Santa
Elena, south of the mountain. The second night they attacked
government troops in Jucuapa, north of the heights.
   If the military's big edge is air support, the guerrilla army's
advantage appears to be in the morale and motiviation of its
fighters.
   The overwhelming majority of government footsoldiers are
adolescent peasants who were drafted into service, although the
army has several elite battalions of seasoned troopers.
   Four U.S. Army colonels, in a report last year on the Salvadoran
conflict, quoted a senior U.S. officer in El Salvador as saying of
government forces, ``When the platoon leader ain't there, you ain't
got a platoon.''
   ``El Salvador reveals an enemy whose commitment to victory is
absolute and unbending,'' the report said. It characterized the
FMLN as ``tough, competent, highly motivated'' and added that it
might be able to ``sustain its current strategy indefinitely.''
   During a recent weekend off from work, an Salvadoran air force
helicopter pilot told how twice in recent months his craft had been
seriously damaged by rebel ground fire. U.S. advisers and local
officers blame Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles smuggled in
to FMLN forces over the past eight months.
   The weapons have an effective range of 800 yards _ more than
twice that of assault weapons such as the Soviet-designed AK-47 and
the U.S. M-16. The Dragunov has obliged pilots to fly higher, take
more hits, bomb less accurately and abandon more missions.
   With air power less effective, the rebels have resumed _ after a
layoff of more than three years _ regular daytime attacks.
   ``We are not going to win the war by killing guerrillas,'' Col.
Rene Ponce, who heads El Salvador's joint chiefs of staff, said in
a recent interview.
   He and other top officers have been pursuing a ``hearts and
minds'' campaign with permanent military presence in zones until
now freely roamed by rebels and ``civic action'' programs of food
and medicine distribution.
   The approach appears to have had some success in the northeast.
But in other regions it is not uncommon to hear peasants refer to
patrolling government soldiers as ``the enemy.''
   Gen. Humberto Larios, the defense minister, recently told
foreign reporters the army killed more than 1,000 guerrillas last
year. He said the rebels are taking heavier losses this year and if
this pace can be sustained, they'll loose closer to 2,000 in 1989.
   Thousands more are being wounded or are deserting rebel ranks,
he said.
   But he declined to predict when any all-out victory would come.
   ``You can't apply a formula to say when this war will end,'' he
said.
   Both the rebels and the new government of President Alfredo
Cristiani, a rightist, say they want to negotiate. But they can't
agree on who should talk, how to talk and what precisely to talk
about.
   ``We do what is necessary to keep the army tied down,'' said
Luis, surrounded by about 30 rebel fighters relaxing, napping,
playing cards or cleaning their weapons.
   ``Meanwhile, we create favorable conditions for the moment of
truth. If there are no negotiations, we'll eventually win. It's
just a question of how high the human and material cost will be.''

<TEXT>
   Antique jewels. Patek Phillipe
watches. Tiffany lamps. Tudor chairs. Impressionist paintings.
   Middle-class Argentines are selling family heirlooms accumulated
during more affluent times in Argentina for the money they need to
get through these days of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
   Art dealers are flocking in from abroad to snap them up.
   ``People are keener to sell for cash right now,'' said Pierre
Yves Gabus, a Geneva-based are appraiser and auctioneer. ``People
want dollars and they are selling what they have to get them.''
   Gabus arrived three years ago. Since then, he has set up shop in
three other cities, and watched as competitors flocked to join him
in Buenos Aires.
   Fabian Ayerza, an assistant director of Sotheby's, said, ``At
the beginning of this century, Argentines traveled often to Europe
and they used to buy quite good things.''
   Now, treasures carried across the Atlantic in the staterooms of
luxury ocean liners are returning home in jetliners.
   ``There's no way to know the volume,'' said Alicia Arteaga, a
reporter who covers art for the newspaper La Nacion. ``A lot of
galleries come in, buy $500,000 worth of French chairs, and leave.''
   Every day, ads appear in newspapers promising cash for antique
furniture, tapestries and rugs, necklaces, autographed manuscripts,
signed crystal and, perhaps most of all, paintings.
   A Patek Philippe watch can fetch $7,000. A sculpture by Mariano
Benlliure y Gil, $330,000. A set of Dutch chairs from the 18th
century, $2,500 each.
   The painting ``Two Gypsies'' by Joaquin Sorolly y Bastida sold
for $140,000; the painting ``The Flight'' by Charles Edouard
Delort, $100,000.
   Buyers particularly want the Impressionist and ``Little Master''
paintings of the mid and late 19th century that were bought by
landowners flush from the sale of beef and grain from their
sprawling estates.
   The best private collections aren't for sale; the richest
Argentines are weathering what is for them the latest downtown in a
decades-long period of stagnation.
   But many children and grandchildren of families whose fortunes
have declined are looking on living room walls and in closets,
jewelry chests and basements for treasures.
   Not a few wind up disappointed.
   ``They bring in an incomplete set of dishes or some old chairs
and a table they bought 40 years ago thinking they are antiques,''
said dealer Franco Levi. ``They don't realize that to be an
antique, something needs to be at least 80 to 100 years old.''
   Fernando Sanchesini, the director of Christie's in Argentina,
said many Argentines bought indiscriminately and lugged home fakes.
   ``It's disastrous for someone who has had a painting hanging on
the wall for many years, thinking it is worth a lot of money, then
we go in there'' and tell them it is worth very little, Sanchesini
said.
   The best pictures fetch prices from $50,000 to $1 million,
dealers said. Some are sold outright. Most are sold on consignment.
   ``A Flemish painting that was bought here for $40,000 sold for
five times that amount in the United States,'' said Mauro
Herlitzka, a collector.
   Argentines don't seem worried by the outflow of such valuable
objects.
   ``It's not like Argentina is losing its cultural heritage,''
said Mrs. Arteaga. ``It's stuff that was brought here and now it's
going back to where it came from.''

   Consider the chances of success for a play
called ``Other People's Money.''
   The author's last work folded on opening night.
   The leading man left to make a film before rehearsals started.
His replacement backed out the day rehearsals were supposed to
begin.
   The third choice, Kevin Conway, was not exactly a box-office
name.
   The director, Gloria Muzio, was even less well known.
   And the Wall Street crash of October 1987 made the subject
matter _ the takeover of a small company by a ruthless tycoon _
seem out-of-date to many experienced theater people.
   None of the above stopped neophyte producers Jeffrey Ash and
Susan Gallin from opening ``Other People's Money'' last February at
the Minetta Lane Theater. In six months, the play by Jerry Sterner
has slowly become one of off-Broadway's biggest hits, with the
sold-out sign now going up for almost every performance.
   ``The favorable word-of-mouth has really done it for us,'' says
Gallin, whose only other producing effort in New York was ``Burn
This'' by Lanford Wilson two years ago.
   Such diverse theatergoers as theater critic John Simon and
business tycoons Carl Icahn and Donald Trump _ Trump saw the play
twice _ have praised ``Other People's Money.'' Trump even offered
to move the play to Broadway, a proposal declined by Ash and Gallin.
   ``I think a successful play on Broadway today has to almost
approach being a musical,'' Ash says. ``It has to have either a
star or something out of the ordinary. Broadway has come to be a
place only for muscials and extravaganzas, and off-Broadway has
become a place to do good plays, like `Driving Miss Daisy,' `The
Cocktail Hour' or `Other People's Money.'''
   Producing a play off-Broadway also is different from producing
on Broadway. Because the theaters are smaller, so are the profit
margins. The line between a profitable and an unprofitable week can
be narrow. Most new off-Broadway shows need time to build audiences.
   Ash and Gallin figured they would lose money during the early
weeks of the run, the time needed for favorable audience reaction
to pay off. Their general manager told them to expect 12 weeks of
losses. They budgeted the show at $525,000, including a reserve
fund of $120,000 raised to pay for a heavy advertising campaign.
   ``I had seen too many mornings when the producers have to scurry
to try and raise money to run an ad or a television spot,'' Ash
says. ``And then they wind up giving away all their producers'
points, selling their soul to get that money. It's terrible.''
   Ash knows something about selling shows. Although ``Other
People's Money'' is his first producing effort, he has been in
theatrical advertising for more than 20 years. Now director of
theatrical accounts for Grey Entertainment and Media, Ash was a
pioneer in developing live-action television ads for Broadway plays
and musicals.
   Ash worked on the advertising for Sterner's last venture, the
short-lived ``Be Happy for Me.'' Despite its quick departure, they
became friends. Sterner knew that Ash wanted to produce and brought
him a copy of ``Other People's Money,'' his second play in early
1987.
   ``I read it and fell quite in love with it,'' Ash recalls.
   The story concerns a barracuda-like corporate raider who wants
to take over a family-owned business that is the lifeblood of a
small New England town. The company hires an attractive female
attorney to battle the takeover artist, and their fights turn from
the financial to the sexual.
   The play had some readings on the West Coast and with actor Paul
Sorvino, who was interested in playing the lead. He didn't, but the
play was done at his American Stage Company in Teaneck, N.J,. in
the spring of 1987.
   Audience reaction was favorable, and Ash had lined up an
investor to put up half the amount needed to bring the play to New
York. Then the stock market crashed in October and the money
evaporated.
   Gallin then entered the picture. She became interested in the
play after a good friend, Davina Belling, went after the movie
rights.
   ``I read a lot of plays, and this one left me with something to
think about,'' Gallin says. ``And it was very entertaining. I even
gave it to people who weren't in the theater to read and I got a
wonderful reaction.''
   Ash and Gallin decided to produce the play together off-Broadway
and went looking for a director. The two producers sought
suggestions from their friends in the theater business. Mark Lamos,
artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company, was on the top of
everybody's list.
   Lamos had other commitments, but a play reader at his theater
recommended it. Lamos finally read ``Other People's Money'' and
loved it. The play, directed by Gloria Muzio, was done at the
Hartford Stage as part of its 1988-89 season.
   ``That was a wonderful experience,'' Gallin says. ``It was good
for the play and for Jerry, who was able to do some rewriting, and
for Gloria, our director, who had time to polish the production.''
   It was the Hartford production, with Conway as a last-minute
replacement as the new leading man, that made it to New York.
   The show opened with a miniscule advance and a favorable but not
overwhelming review in The New York Times, which didn't deter the
two producers.
   ``We did a radio campaign, sponsoring business reports on
all-news radio stations in New York, advertised in the Wall Street
Journal and sent letters to the CEOs of many corporations and
invited them to come,'' Ash says.
   Now the stretch limos are regular fixtures in front of the
Minetta Lane Theater, as well as more ordinary theatergoers drawn
by the favorable word-of-mouth. Ash and Gallin are now
contemplating a national tour for the play, probably with a star,
and also a London production.
   ``It's a play that stays with people somehow,'' Ash says. ``They
keep talking about it for days afterward. And even two years after
the big stock market crash, it's relevant. You pick up the
newspaper and you see this thing about Warner Brothers and Time

   ``Salaam Bombay!'' (Virgin Vision, Inc., English subtitles.
VHS-Beta, $79.95)
   
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is a heartrending look at the homeless street
children of Bombay, India. But its meanings and nuances transcend
that exotic locale.
   The film, which won a number of international film awards in
1988, is a rivetting portrayal of how 20th-century societies,
including so-called civilized ones, are devouring their young,
alternately selling them, or selling them short.
   Producer-director Mira Nair traveled the streets of Bombay,
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt, drugs and
prostitution.
   She decided to tell their story, not with actors, but with
children she gathered from those very backstreets.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is the story of 10-year-old Krishna.
Abandoned first by his mother, then by the traveling circus he
joins, he travels to Bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back
to his mother.
   Krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads
to a murder. But somehow, almost miraculously, he keeps a
child-like empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes. He
befriends a desperate drug addict, and comforts an abject
16-year-old sold by her own mother to a brothel.
   The film's producers decided to use proceeds to establish
learning centers for the street children of Bombay and Delhi.
   ``Salaam Bombay!'' is not rated. It has no objectionable
language or sexual encounters, but the themes of street life are
nonetheless unvarnished.
   It is a truly exceptional film.

   ``Crusoe'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG-13.)
   
   ``Crusoe,'' based on the tale of a shipwreck on a tropical
island, is a lush and aesthectically pleasing movie, and as ripe
with moral dilemmas as the burdened coconut trees swaying on the
beach.
   In ``Crusoe,'' values come crashing down and savagely splinter
the beliefs of the movie's star, Aidan Quinn.
   Quinn plays a greedy young 19th-century slave trader who tempts
fate by taking one final and risky expedition to round up more
blacks from Africa. But his ship becomes ensnared in a vicious
autumn storm and all aboard perish, except for Quinn, who winds up
sprawled on a desolate beach.
   Crusoe learns to endure the solitude and fashions a comfortable
shelter for himself on the picturesque island.
   Before long his isolation is interrupted by visiting natives. He
rescues one from a human sacrifice and decides keep him as a slave.
But the native later escapes and is killed.
   In a provocative twist, Crusoe becomes the hunted and is trapped
by another islander. But the two men reach an accord and build
something of a friendship.
   The film's ending is the final test of Crusoe's new respect for
the man he once wanted to enslave.
   Director Caleb Deschanel so effectively captures the panoramic
beauty of the island setting _ with its creamy white sand beaches,
dense verdant forests and crystal blue tide pools _ one can almost
taste the salt spray in the breeze.
   There also is very little dialogue, but the engrossing visuals
and the moral struggles make for compelling viewing.

   ``Thrilled to Death'' (Republic. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   B-movie fans, beware. ``Thrilled to Death'' is an A, as in
absolutely awlful.
   The script is bad, the acting terrible and even the filming is
poor with washed-out colors and fuzziness.
   It's a movie that uses the backdrop of a swingers' club to
unravel a tale of murder and drug dealing. Along the way, there's
some nudity, strong language and graphic violence.
   Two couples meet and become friends. Only one couple has set up
the other to take a fall in a drug-and-murder doublecross.
   Cliff Bahner and Rebecca Lynn play a mystery novelist and his
wife; Richard Maris and Christine Moore are the bad guys.

   ``Good Evening'' (Warner Bros.) _ Marshall Crenshaw
   
   Marshall Crenshaw has spent a meandering solo career trying to
live up to the promise of his sparkling 1982 debut. He's finally
done it on ``Good Evening,'' largely because he's changed many of
the elements that made him a success in the first place.
   That debut was a pristine piece of pop-rock, hearkening back to
the days of Buddy Holly. But the stripped-down sound eventually
became a trap.
   ``Good Evening'' has Crenshaw significantly toughening and
filling out his sound with the help of slide and pedal steel
guitarists such as David Lindley, Sonny Landreth and James Burton.
John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff completes the rock 'n' roll
kick.
   It's welcome power behind a guy who, rightly or wrongly, had
developed a reputation as a rock 'n' roll wimp, mostly because of
his sweet voice and sweet songs.
   Crenshaw also recognizes his limitations as a writer for the
first time. He's always been able to create a couple of catchy
tunes per record, but is unable to sustain interest through a full
album.
   Here he interprets songs by Richard Thompson, John Hiatt, Bobby
Fuller and the Isley Brothers. He even seeks co-writing help on
some of his own songs. The welcome diversity of voices make his own
contributions, particularly ``She Hates to Go Home,'' sound that
much better.
   The cliche-ridden ``Radio Girl'' is really the only mistake on
this 10-song album. The Thompson-written ``Valerie'' and ``Good
Hearts'' are particularly appealing.
   It took some time _ probably too much _ for Crenshaw to find
what's right for him. But the rewards here are plentiful.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Peter Falk Returns to Sing Sing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Cookie'' Opens Aug. 18</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Peter Falk filmed scenes for his new
movie ``Cookie'' at Sing Sing, it marked a sentimental return.
   Not that he was ever a guest at the legendary slammer. He grew
up in Ossining, N.Y.
   ``Yeah, I remember Sing Sing,'' he reflected. ``As a kid, I used
to go into the prison because the town's basketball team played the
prisoners. A lot of the kids I went to school with, their fathers
were guards there.
   ``Whenever you mentioned to people that you came from Ossining,
they always had the same question: Do the lights go out when they
electrocute somebody? Of course the lights never dimmed. You were
not aware of the prison as an ominous thing.
   ``The major memory about Sing Sing had to do with the one big
escape when I was in high school. Three guys broke out and went
down to the river by the railroad station and got a hold of a boat.
One local cop was shot on the way down, and one of the convicts was
shot. They actually rowed across the Hudson, and they were picked
up on the Palisades across the way. That was a big thing.''
   In the new Warner Bros. release, ``Cookie,'' Falk is mobster
Dino Capino, who is about to be sprung after 13 years in Sing Sing.
His teen-age daughter, played with amazing skill by English actress
Emily Lloyd, comes to visit him. She is resentful, since he hasn't
married her mother (Dianne Wiest). He already has a wife (Brenda
Vaccaro). As you might guess, ``Cookie'' is not ``The Godfather
III.''
   After his long service as TV's slovenly gumshoe, Columbo, Falk
is on the other side of the law. That's were he started in movies.
   ``It was nice being a mob guy again,'' he remarked. ``It was
nice looking good, too. Great suits they gave me. Did I look good?
I thought I did.'' However he would brook no criticism of his
Columbo raincoat, which is still in action after 29 years.
   ``You know my first picture was `Murder Inc.' in 1960? I made a
little splash in that,'' he said. ``I played Abie Reles, who was
part of that Jewish mob that operated out of Brooklyn at that time.
They were the first ones who hired themselves out to kill people.
They were all quite crazy. Abie was probably the craziest.
   ``Those mob guys when they saw that picture, they went for it.
They liked me. They came around, and I spent some time with them. I
had a real interest in those guys _ I think everybody does.
   ``I remember going around with some cops in New York. They were
mostly involved in drug cases, but they also had some wire taps of
mob guys. I wanna tell ya, if I had those tapes here and could play
'em for ya, you'd roll on the floor. There are no funnier
conversations I ever heard in my life.''
   Peter Falk may sound like a street guy, but he has a bachelor's
degree in political science from the New School of Social Research
in New York. He was studying for his master's at the University of
Syracuse when he dropped out to try acting.
   ``When I started out, I was 25-26 years old in off-Broadway in
New York,'' he said. ``Like most actors I knew at that time, we all
wanted the same thing: to be in the Actors Studio. We thought that
was heaven on Earth.
   ``I never thought about being in movies, I never thought about
being in television. I just wanted to be a stage actor. I remember
this agent _ I've told the story before _ the guy said to me, `You
know, you won't be able to do TV or movies.' I don't know why, but
that didn't make any difference to me. Because I had never
considered doing TV or movies.
   ``I asked what he was talking about, and he said, `Your glass
eye.''' Falk lost his eye when he was 3. He won an Academy
nomination for his supporting performance in ``Murder, Inc.'' and
he has been working in films and television ever since.
   Falk won three Emmy awards for his portrayal of Lt. Columbo
during its 1971-1977 run on NBC. Last season, ABC installed
``Columbo'' as part of its ``ABC Mystery Movie,'' much to Falk's
delight. The show has been renewed for 1989-90, and he hopes to
play the role for years to come.
   ``I'll play him as long as the people want to see him,'' he
said. ``I think it would terrific to grow old as Columbo. If
Columbo really can't hear (chuckling) ... and Columbo really can't
see (more chuckles) ... and he gets to the point where it takes him
an hour to get into the office. I think that would be hilarious.
   ``I'd like to see him saying, `What's my name?' (laughing) `Did
you murder someone?' `What case IS this. I gotta call the office
and find out.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Such Stuff as Dreams Are Made on</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New truths hang within the old walls of
Palazzo Reale. As the theory goes, they are such stuff as dreams
are made on.
   Inside the 18th-century royal palace are the works of 300
artists, poets and philosophers who sought a different truth beyond
the boundaries of reason.
   The show is ``The Surrealists,'' and it is the biggest
exhibition of the movement Andre Breton once described as an
attempt ``to resolve the previously contradictory conditions of
dream and reality.''
   Breton was the French poet who helped guide and first define the
movement in the early 1920s. He was a close friend of Arturo
Schwarz, the curator and driving force of the Milan show that
presents surrealism's history in almost 2,000 works of art,
documents and publications.
   ``Without false modesty it is the most important exhibition ever
presented since the beginning of surrealism,'' Schwarz said.
   Inside the palace hang the hallucinations of artists such as Max
Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Salvador Dali _ fantastic perspectives in
absurd and chaotic dreamscapes, seemingly incompatible objects
painted together in a context alien to both of them with a fanciful
but meticulous realism. As the French poet Comte de Lautreamont put
it, ``beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an
umbrella on an operating table.''
   This side of surrealism transforms isolated anatomical parts
into grotesque creatures. It captures weird and wonderous objects
on an ethereal plain.
   ``Surrealism rests upon belief in the higher reality of specific
forms of associations, previously neglected, in the omnipotence of
dreams and in the disinterested play of thought,'' wrote Breton.
   Few of the original surrealists, who exchanged their
revolutionary ideas and rage against the social order in Paris
cafes in the '20s, are still alive.
   Salvador Dali died Jan. 23. His images of watery timepieces,
melting flesh and disfigured appendages became symbols of
irrational expression and insolence for the group of writers,
painters and philosophers who had set out to explode the social
order. They included the artists Tanguy, Arp, Miro, Magritte and
Ernst, filmmaker Luis Bunuel, and writers Breton and Paul Eluard.
   
   Jean (Hans) Arp, Joan Miro and Andre Masson emphasize the
abstract nature of surrealism, although their forms sometimes grow
into animate, figurative and representational patterns.
   With these strange and hypnotic images, Schwarz presents the
poets, essayists and philosophers whose words complement the
painters' baffling visions but also give the movement direction and
perspective.
   ``In the show I wanted to dispel two common falsehoods. The
first is that surrealism is a movement confined to painting. It
started as a literary, political and philosophical movement,'' he
said.
   Surrealism was mainly a movement of poets and writers with a
very strong political commitment, said Schwarz. It was one that
increasingly became preoccupied with communism, although the
Communist Party would have none of it.
   ``The other myth is that surrealism is associated with Dali and
that's all. He was the least important of the surrealists,'' said
Schwarz.
   ``No two surrealists are alike. Every single surrealist artist
has his own voice. The only thing that unites them is the common
endeavor to express the deepest impulses of one's pysche.
   ``Each artist expresses himself to the best of his ability,
trying to put on canvas the phantoms, dreams and desires of his
conscious and unconscious.''
   The idea for the show began when Deputy Mayor Luigi Corbani
called Schwarz on Feb. 14 and asked him if he could put together a
show on surrealism that would open June 7. A day later Schwarz
agreed _ on one condition.
   This was, he said, ``that I be given a blank check to do
whatever I wanted.''
   Time was short and Schwarz wanted to exhibit all the main trends
and the key surrealists. He wanted to bring together a collection
never before achieved because of budgetary and geographical
constraints.
   ``I worked from four in the morning until midnight every day for
four months,'' said Schwarz.
   The result is the show of 945 original works of art and 970
documents, first editions, letters and extremely rare periodicals.
He also published a detailed 669-page catalog.
   ``The show is never the one that its curator would like it to
be,'' complained Schwarz, lamenting his inability to acquire
certain works. Still, he says the exhibit includes at least 30 to
40 masterpieces that are essential to a survey of surrealism.
   Schwarz also presents the works of the precursors to surrealism,
such as Hieronymus Bosch, who represent what he calls ``the black
romantic trend'' that has always existed in art. He also includes
works from ``companions of the street'' _ Giorgio de Chirico,
Marcel Duchamp and other artists.
   Surrealism, says Schwarz, gave the artist the freedom to
completely express himself, his inner self, his convictions.
   ``That is why so many painters were attracted to surrealism
because it offered them a complete philosophy of life, not only a
cooking recipe such as cubism or impressionism,'' said Schwarz.
   Surrealism had a major influence on the movements that followed
it, such as abstract expressionism. But Schwarz says it made one
overriding contribution:
   ``It liberated the artists from the shackles of moral and
aesthetic canons.''
   The exhibition closes Sept. 10.

   Twenty-two years after they began, 14 years
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at Woodstock,
Ten Years After is back together.
   A Chrysalis album, ``About Time,'' will be released in August,
15 years after their last one, and a seven-week fall U.S. tour is
planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the
1960s blues revival in England, known for its fast and furious
blend of blues and medium-heavy rock, has not mellowed out.
   Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee has been performing, while bassist
Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill and drummer Rick Lee have
stayed in music, producing, engineering and managing.
   In an interview with Alvin Lee and Lyons, Lee said that the band
didn't so much split up as wind down. ``We'd had some degree of
success and we'd all got nice houses and families. There was a bit
of pressure to stay at home.''
   He said that before Ten Years After split, ``Critics said I was
a fast, tasteless guitar player. That was bothering me a bit. I
shouldn't have let it, now I realize.''
   So he put together the seven-piece In Flight. ``Critics said it
was wonderful and I was playing better than ever. I missed the roar
of the crowd and the loudness after a while. That band wasn't
capable of playing heavy rock. I went back to playing from my blues
and rock roots.'' He formed Ten Years Later for a year, then Alvin
Lee and Company, which played some Ten Years After favorites.
   ``When we played together last summer, suddenly it sounded like
Ten Years After, right from the first note. It was obvious Ten
Years After had its own sound,'' Lee said.
   Reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic, Lyons said, that
the four decided to stay together. Lee and Lyons, each working with
other people, wrote 40 songs. The band recorded 15. Unable to
decide on 10, they put 11 on ``About Time.''
   In July, Ten Years After played before 80,000 in East Berlin.
   Asked about Woodstock, which took place 20 years ago on a farm
in Bethel, N.Y., on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, Lyons says, ``It's all a
bit hazy now, to be honest.''
   Still, memories come back.
   ``We were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared,'' Lee said.
``Nobody could play for two or three hours. Sparks were flying on
the stage. I thought it outdid the music by far. God's light show.
   ``In a way it was fortunate. I went for a walk around the lake
and joined in with the audience. Nobody knew I was one of the
musicians. Half a million people can't all run under trees. They
sat there and started singing. People were playing on mud slides.
It was a wonderful thing to see that happening. Everybody was
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation. I think it brought
the best out of everybody.
   ``People were offering food and drink. It was very idealistic,
very nice. I think had it not been for the storm, probably I would
never have seen much.
   ``One of the reasons I went out was because in the backstage
area there wasn't a single cigarette. I came back with 10 marajuana
cigarettes, no regular cigarettes.''
   Lyons said, ``They said the food backstage was spiked with acid.
Whether it was true or not, it dims the appetite. The drinks were
supposed to be dodgy. In those days you never used to drink from an
open can anyhow.''
   Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for
``I'm Going Home,'' the high-energy rocker used in the
``Woodstock'' movie and, they think, the jazzy ``I Can't Keep From
Crying Sometimes'' and ``Love Like a Man.''
   ``I remember we did `Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl,''' Lyons
said, ``because the tuning went out because of atmospheric
conditions. We had to stop the song, apologize and retune. We did
`Going Home' as an encore.''
   ``We were the first on after the storm,'' Lee recalled.
``Everybody was worried. Sparks were still flying off the stage and
it was very wet. Somebody had to do it. Think how many of our
records would have sold if we'd been electrocuted.''
   ``It was definitely the movie that made Woodstock the memorable
thing it was,'' Lee said. ``Toronto was probably as good a festival
as Woodstock. It got forgotten.
   ``We carried on in 3,000 to 5,000-seat halls. A year later the
movie came out and we're into 20,000 seaters.''
   The night before their Woodstock appearance, Ten Years After was
in St. Louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience.
   ``Nina Simone went on,'' Lyons said. ``Four white hippies went
on afterwards. When we walked on stage, an uproar was starting. It
was frightening. But we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were
OK then.''
   Lee sais that in one way Woodstock was a statement against
racial prejudice. ``It was even more about the peace movement and
the Vietnam War. We thought the peace movement was very real and a
good thing to be doing. Woodstock tended to make it into a
fashionable thing. The fashion grew old and it was no longer cool
to be a hippie.''
   Lyons added, ``Woodstock was anti-establishment, a peace and
love thing, anti-violence. It was for tolerance, let people do what
they want, help one another. I think it had a lot of long-term
benefits.''
   But they didn't know what Woodstock symbolized before they got
there. Lee said, ``It was just another line on the sheet.''
   They flew from St. Louis to New York and drove until they came
to blocked roads.
   ``They took us in an Army helicopter,'' Lee said. ``I was
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience. It was a
mind-blowing experience.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Cynthia Kadohata's Landscape</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Floating World,'' Cynthia Kadohata's first
novel, is best read on a window seat of a Greyhound bus. Names and
places speed by. Friendships form quickly. Departures come with
little warning.
   Through Olivia, the book's young narrator, Kadohata evokes a
life of gas stations and motels, wrecked cars and part-time jobs. A
world where a marriage of 10 years is treated with disbelief and
some disdain, where no place is like home.
   ``Sometimes when I'm on a Greyhound bus I think this is where I
belong,'' the author explained. ``I've never spent a year somewhere
and said, `This is it.' I haven't really got off that bus, but I'd
like to.''
   As a child, Kadohata was shocked to learn that her classmates
had assigned bedtimes. There were few rules in her house, little
routine at all.
   She was born in Chicago, but soon lived in Arkansas and Georgia.
By the time she was 9, her parents were divorced and she had
returned to Chicago with her mother, sister and brother. Kadohata
now lives in Manhattan, but feels restless, suspicious of setting
down roots.
   ``The Floating World'' (Viking, $17.95) is not autobiographical,
Kadohata insists, despite the book's story of Olivia's experiences
as she moves across the country during the 1950s and '60s. What
``The Floating World'' does capture, however, is the feelings
brought on by constant upheaval.
   ``Even today I sometimes feel I don't know where I belong,'' the
author said. ``Too bad. A lot of times I would like having a
feeling of belonging but I like traveling, too.''
   She writes from the perspective of a second-generation
Japanese-American whose father was interned in prison camp during
World War II, and who learned quickly how fragile the allegiances
of family and neighborhood could be.
   ``It was really upsetting,'' she said of her father's
experience. ``The thing is that I know it will never happen to me.
Yet because it happened to my father, I'm less sure of my place in
the world.''
   Kadohata first wanted to be a journalist, but a few years after
graduating from college she began writing short stories. She's been
published in The New Yorker, Grand Street and The Pennsylvania
Review.
   ``With fiction, you can change the facts to reveal a larger
truth; that's the root of fiction. That's the problem I have with
nonfiction. I would be so tempted to tell a lie because it would
tell the story better. That's what makes nonfiction so great, too _
all the tension.''
   At the start of World War II, when Japan was the United States'
bitter enemy, Olivia's grandparents are forced to give their
children American names such as Roger, Lily, Laura Ann. The
tradition is passed on to Olivia and her siblings _ Ben, Walker and
Peter.
   ``When I read on the cover of Time magazine, `Are the Japanese
being unfair?,' I kind of think people are going to be mad at me,''
Kadohata said.
   ``I do have that sort of identification. It's hard because I
look Japanese, whereas somebody whose parents came over from Italy,
no one would think of ascociating him that closely with Italy.
   Kadohata's infuences, however, are profoundly American. She
draws on the Southern writer William Faulkner's feelings of
restlessness and chaos, and uses the spare language of Raymond
Carver and Bobbie Ann Mason.
   And, like Faulkner, she is fascinated with the blurring of myth
and reality. As Olivia rides through Oklahoma, a hitchhiker appears
and quickly vanishes. Kadohata also writes of an encounter between
Olivia and a friend of her stepfather's:
   ```See my house?' he said. `It's an illusion, it's not really
there.'
   ``I looked at the house. Surrounded by dark and trees and below
an ornage-ringed moon, it did not seem quite real. That's what I
thought he meant.''
   The author explained: ``I wanted some things to be fantastical.
That's a lot like me. I daydream a lot. It's kind of like the
saying about magic, it's true if you believe it and it's not true
if you don't believe it.''
   After Olivia, the narrator of ``The Floating World,'' graduates
from high school, she moves to California, which had a mythic hold
on Kadohata and many Americans as the symbol of a better life.
   ``When we first moved there,'' she recalled, ``we were in a
truck with my mother's boyfriend and we had driven across country.
I looked at all these little houses and I was just heartbroken. It
wasn't what I expected. I expected to think it was a promised
land.''
   She first called the book ``Seven Moons,'' wanting to use the
phases of the moon to mark the passage of time.
   ``I was going to put the moon in all over. Maybe it's just
continuity. I just wanted to describe the moon,'' she said.
``That's why I love traveling, taking the bus. I like to look at
the landscape.''

   Flowers are placed daily on his grave.
Letters come in constantly from around the world.
   Promising country music singer Keith Whitley died of an
accidental alcohol overdose in May, but he lives on in the memories
of his fans and the legacy of his music.
   An album recorded just a month before he died, ``I Wonder Do You
Think of Me,'' was released in July by BMG Music-RCA Records. The
first single release from the album carries the same name, now made
ironic by his death. He was 33 when he was found dead at his
suburban Nashville home on May 9.
   ``After it (the album) was cut, he felt it was his best work,''
said Joe Galante, senior vice president and general manager of RCA
Records in Nashville.
   Others agree that the handsome, bearded Whitley was becoming a
major force in country music until his personal demons felled his
considerable talent.
   ``He was beginning a super career,'' said Jack McFadden, his
manager. ``He was rolling. He had three No. 1 records and had just
finished a great album. He was drawing large crowds and having
standing room only crowds in most of the clubs he played. There
were standing ovations every show.
   ``He was a great entertainer. And a great kid.''
   His hit record at the time of his death, ``I'm No Stranger to
the Rain,'' continues to be one of the most-played music videos on
Country Music Television, country music's version of MTV and VH1.
   ``He was a rare artist,'' said Garth Fundis, his record
producer. ``When he sang songs about things close to him, it was
always soulful and from the heart. Very few singers can equal what
he did in the music he recorded.''
   Since Whitley's death, fans have reacted by sending literally
hundreds of letters and floral tributes.
   McFadden visited the grave site a few weeks after the burial and
was touched by the outpouring.
   ``There were large crowds and flowers everywhere. People have
come from Texas, Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, the Carolinas, all
over,'' he said.
   ``We're still getting mail, stacks of mail. There has been mail,
and phone calls, from England and even Africa.''
   Whitley, a native of Sandy Hook, Ky., sang wrenching tunes about
pain and joy such as ``Don't Close Your Eyes'' and ``When You Say
Nothing at All.'' He is a posthumous candidate as country music's
male vocalist of the year.
   After Whitley died, a fund in his name was created at Vanderbilt
Medical Center's Institute for Treatment of Addiction. McFadden
said more than $4,000 was contributed to the fund in the first few
weeks following the death.
   ``It's coming in every day,'' he said. ``They told me at
Vanderbilt that they have received calls from people outside
Nashville, like Hollywood celebrities. This has affected them.''
   McFadden said he was aware that the sandy-haired Whitley had a
drinking problem, but the singer hid it well and few knew about it.
Whitley had said publicly that he battled alcoholism in his younger
years.
   According to the coroner, his blood alcohol content was
equivalent to 20 one-ounce shots of 100-proof whiskey. He was well
beyond the lethal level, 0.30.
   ``He was controlling it for the most part,'' McFadden said.
``Every once in a while, he'd slip. He'd had the problem for many
years, starting in his teens. He did quit for six months, then
started nipping and quit again.''
   ``I noticed an attitude change in the last three or four months.
He was normally a giving, warm, loving person, but he got a little
ragged, nervous and uptight.''
   Some members of Whitley's band have taken jobs with other
country singers such as Clint Black, though McFadden said, ``A
couple of the guys are so overcome they just don't feel like
working for a while.''
   His 140 concert appearances, which were scheduled as far ahead
as next January, have been canceled or assumed by others.
   Whitley's wife, Grand Ole Opry star Lorrie Morgan, has resumed
her career which is on the upswing. Her record, ``Dear Me,'' was a
Top 10 country hit in July.
   ``She's grabbed hold of herself and taken charge and is working
and taking care of her family,'' McFadden said. The couple, known
affectionately as ``Mr. and Mrs. Country Music,'' had two children,
a 2-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter.
   ``She grieves,'' McFadden said. ``When she's not busy, she has a
rough time.''
   The two recorded duets together but those have not been released.

   Over its 100-year existence, Wendy and
John Wheat's Victorian house has undergone many renovations _ not
all of them fortunate.
   ``The worst thing done to the house was to put asbestos shingles
up. They're known as the skin disease of house renovation,'' says
Mrs. Wheat. Though the Wheats hated the shingles, they liked the
lines, interior arrangement and location of the four-bedroom house
in Rowayton when they bought it four years ago.
   Today, what was once an unprepossessing home is now a charming
restored Victorian decorated with a pleasing mix of American
country, Victorian and contemporary furnishings.
   The Wheats have given the house a new lease on life with a
structural and decorative facelift, which has included new exterior
siding and insulation, the addition of architectural elements, and
new paint and wallpaper.
   Substituting better quality and more architecturally interesting
doors and windows has made a subtle but substantial difference in
the appearance of their home. The change has brought out the
original character of the Victorian and provided a greater sense of
quality for a relatively small outlay.
   The couple spent about $60,000 on the renovation, which they
financed through a home equity loan and an inheritance.
   The largest and most costly job involved removing the shingles
and putting up new clapboard siding with Victorian fish scale
shingles in the peaks. The resurfacing and installation of
appropriate architectural trim has exposed the good lines of the
original house. The most spectacular interior improvement has been
redoing the master bedroom, bath and dressing area.
   The Wheats hired a professional designer to help them. ``We knew
it would be a little more expensive to use a decorator, but we felt
that we would end up with a better job and that it would add more
value to the house,'' says Mrs. Wheat, a recreational therapist who
works with seniors. Her husband works in marketing for a bank.
   They chose Westport decorator Beverly Ellsley, whose work they
had seen and liked in showhouses and magazines.
   ``After only 10 minutes, she pointed out every single thing that
bothered me about the house, and all her suggestions were just
right. As a professional, she was able to cut corners in some
places and she did come in at budget. She did not impose her own
taste,'' says Mrs. Wheat.
   The home is furnished with an eclectic mix of American country
and antique furniture, English scrubbed pine, a few Victorian
pieces and a contemporary sofa. Much of the place's charm comes
from mementos and artwork which mean a great deal to them.
   Paintings by Wheat's father, a profesional artist, coexist
comfortably with his own artworks in wood as well as crafts the
couple has collected during travels in Mexico and Greece.
   The Wheats exercised frugality by selecting furnishings
judiciously and by doing some of the work themselves. For example,
they splurged on built-in custom cabinetry in the master bedroom,
but pickled the white pine cabinetry themselves, saving about
$1,500 to $2,000.
   The bed in the eclectic Victorian-contemporary country room is
covered in several layers of expensive sheets by Ralph Lauren. But
Mrs. Wheat bought some of the sheets in an outlet shop. She used
material from a flat king-sized sheet that cost about $100 to sew a
border on a plain white sheet. Leftover fabric from that sheet
eventually will be used to cover throw pillows. Lace curtains at
the windows in the living room are inexpensive panels purchased for
about $4 each in a craft supplies outlet.
   The bedroom-dressing area was remodeled to provide more storage
and better light. Three unmatched windows were replaced with two on
each side of the room that match and a new half-round window
framing a sunburst design, set dramatically high above the bed at
the ceiling line.
   A king-sized bed is now placed against the pine bookshelf wall
with built-in nightstands. Opposite the bed, a wall of built-in
cabinetry has mirrored doors above and drawers below. Normally
inaccessible high open shelves in both units are used for
decorative storage.
   The couple retiled the bathroom with a blue and white
checkerboard floor and installed a new shower.
   Now that the major work is done, the Wheats say they are
content. Some day they hope to redo the deck as a Victorian porch,
add a second screened porch and possibly do over the kitchen.
   A dream is to put in a small home gym, say the couple, who have
been married 13 years. But meanwhile, ``it's nice to look around
and be really satisfied with what we see,'' says Mrs. Wheat.

   You don't need a decorating authority to tell you that a room
with whitewashed walls, unpolished terra cotta floors, blue and
white tiles and an antique walnut armoire is a country French style
room.
   This rustic, traditional style is one of the most popular looks
currently. Consequently, you'll find many reproductions in the
marketplace to help you achieve it, says Pierre Moulin, co-author
of ``Pierre Deux's French Country.''
   A principal of Pierre Deux, the New York antiques firm that
helped popularize the style, Moulin says the French country look is
more an overall feeling than any single specific group of
furnishings.
   However, he says, some of these elements in antiques or
reproductions help to create a French country room:
   _ An armoire _ often as tall as 10 feet _ was often part of a
bride's dowry and was passed down from one generation to another.
Today, armoires are used to store a great variety of belongings
such as clothing, linens, home entertainment equipment, dinnerware
and barware. Armoires look great in virtually any room, especially
the living area, dining room and bedroom.
   French armoires are usually walnut or cherry and often feature
carvings of flowers, wheat or vine leaves. Some of the prettiest
armoires, however, have painted finishes.
   _ Dining chairs in country French rooms are rustic and simple.
Rush seats are typical but cane and ladder backs are also used.
   _ Appropriate French country beds include canopy beds, beds with
panel headboards and day beds. A white mesh draped-metal framed bed
with a canopy frame that comes to a center point is a romantic
treatment. Most country bedrooms were quite simple, with a minimum
of possessions and accessories on display.
   _ Country French fabrics emphasize natural fibers. Good choices
include vividly colored Provencal prints, plaids and tapestries and
toile de Jouy scenes in white with black, red, green or blue can be
used both as upholstery and to line walls.
   If you're stuck for a color scheme or fabric choice, look at the
provincial paintings of Cezanne and Van Gogh to get some ideas.
   Here are some additional decorating suggestions from Michael
Delgaudio, fashion director of Henredon Furniture:
   Paint the walls white. A stucco finish is ideal because it
provides a rustic feeling.
   Terra cotta tile, bare wood planking or sisal matting are all
appropriate choices for floors. If you like the look of tile, but
don't want to install it, try painting the floor with a blue and
white trompe l'oeil tile pattern.
   Arrange furniture symmetrically and use pairs of furniture and
accessories to create a strong feeling of balance. For example,
place the same model of console table or chairs at either side of a
door or sofa. Place two candlesticks on a mantel.
   Emphasize accessories such as pewter, glazed and unglazed
ceramic pieces, copper pots, straw baskets, dried flowers. For
fresh flowers, favor potted geraniums and bunches of daisies and
hang pictures a little higher than normal.
   Arrange the interior of armoires attractively so you can leave
them open. Line them with French fabric, as housewives did in
Provence. Keep window treatments simple; lace panels are
appropriate.

   For people who don't want to be pinned down to a single style,
American country is one of the best decorating choices.
   Since it is an adaptation of rural designs to suit contemporary
needs and not from a single period or place, American country is
well adapted to today's needs, says designer Raymond Waites.
   Waites has written several books on American country style and
has also designed reproduction collections of furniture, fabrics,
wall coverings and accessories. He says that ``the overriding point
of American country is its spirit. You can mix periods and styles
as long as the room maintains its casual quality.''
   For example, he says it's easily possible to put together a room
that includes Shaker reproductions, primitive painted pieces and
Victorian wicker. When decorating American country style, look for
rustic furniture in native American woods such as walnut, chestnut,
maple and pine or painted pieces.
   Stanley Hura is a designer who has created many American country
rooms settings in which to display the Museum of American Folk Art
reproduction collection by Lane. He offers these tips to a
successful American country room:
   Keep backgrounds simple and uncluttered. Choose clear colors and
select accessories that are not too fussy. You can soften the
feeling of the contemporary American country room with lace and
floral fabrics. Or you can make the room more masculine with
cowhide and American Indian motifs, he says.
   Hura says that there are several ways to go with traditional
American country rooms. First, decide whether you want to create a
formal or a rustic setting.
   If it's formal _ a style that suggests small-town America of the
mid-19th century _ choose Victorian style furniture such as
adaptations of English and French pieces. Use area rugs, such as an
oriental or a needlepoint rug, on the floors. You can choose simple
window treatments or more elaborate layered effects that combine a
heavier fabric with a sheer undercurtain. Wallpaper the walls,
making use of borders to take the place of architectural detailing
that may be lacking.
   A more primitive and rustic room is the result when you select
twig furniture, rustic pine pieces or the newly popular arts and
crafts style. Place rag rugs or hooked rugs on the floors. Walls
can be simply whitewashed or stencilled. Rough textured fabrics of
homespun cotton and linen are appropriate, and simple country
pottery and tin spatterware are suitable. Baskets of dried flowers,
flowering potted plants and original or reproductions of primitive
paintings are also in character.
   Another variant of the American country look incorporates motifs
from the American West, such as California mission furniture,
ornate yet rough-hewn Spanish or Mexican pieces, or German-American
Biedermaier pieces. The color scheme comes from Indians blankets
and the earth tones of the American West.
   An advantage in furnishing American country style is that
reproductions from virtually all the earlier periods are now
available. Besides colonial and federal style furniture, you'll
find reproductions of country pieces from the 19th century as well
as copies of mission and arts and crafts style furniture.

   American homeowners spent an average of $6,600 on remodeling,
renovation or repair over the past five years, according to a
survey by the Better Homes and Gardens Consumer Panel.
   The survey also found that most considered family a key reason
for home ownership, but one-quarter of those asked felt the home
was important as an investment and for financial security.
   ``Part of the satisfaction of home ownership,'' says Allen
Sabbag, president of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service,
``stems from the deep feelings Americans hold toward their home as
a focal point for the family.
   ``Survey results show that for nearly two-thirds of the panel a
home's primary importance is to serve as a place to protect and
gather the family.''
   Thirty-eight percent of the respondents spent between $2,500 and
$10,000 for remodeling and renovating in the five-year period, with
17 percent spending more than $10,000.

   There may not be more phony antiques than there used to be, but
Americans are certainly more aware of them, says Samuel Pennington,
editor of the Maine Antique Digest.
   However, consumers can protect themselves, according to
Pennington and Myrna Kaye, an authority on antique American
furniture.
   Keep an open mind and bring a bright light when you go shopping
for antique furniture, says Kaye, author of ``Fake, Fraud or
Genuine? Identifying Authentic American Antique Furniture.''
   Although a good deal of the antique American furniture on the
market is not as described, in her opinion, a questioning attitude
and careful examination can help one to spot fakes.
   Kaye says that next to a questioning attitude, a strong light is
the most useful aid in identifying furniture that may be posing as
something it is not. She carries a 500-watt portable lamp and uses
it whenever the light is not adequate for complete scrutiny of a
piece. A good flashlight can achieve the same results.
   Other tools Kaye takes along on antique furniture-hunting jaunts
include a yardstick and calipers to measure shrinkage.
   Since old wood furniture invariably shows signs of shrinkage,
taking measurements in several places helps you spot shrinkage and,
hence, confirm that a piece is old. Calipers can be used to take
the dimensions of the round turned parts of wood furniture.
   She also carries tweezers and a needle. The needle is to probe
what look like wormholes. A drill, rather than worms, made any hole
that is deeper than one-eighth of an inch. The tweezers are useful
in extracting splinters which are a common hazard when running your
bare hands over a piece of wood furniture to see if it has the same
degree of roughness all over.
   The types of fakes she says are most common include ``married''
pieces, consisting of parts of different pieces that have been put
together; assembled sets in which one or more elements are new, and
furniture that has been embellished _ for example, with an extra
fan carving _ so that it looks better or more expensive than the
original piece.
   The outright fraud made specifically to deceive is the rarest,
she says, because it takes too much time and money to produce it
and rarely would the anticipated price justify this kind of effort.
   The best indication of authenticity is consistency, adds Kaye.
To ascertain if a piece is consistent, look at each detail of
construction separately. She starts by sizing the piece up to get
an overall impression. Then she opens and removes drawers, looking
at the back and base of cabinets and chairs. She says that
well-finished, unseen areas of furniture excite her suspicion
because American cabinetmakers of the past rarely, if ever,
finished parts that didn't show.
   Since there are no statistics, there is no way to quantify the
number of fakes, according to Pennington. But awareness of the
potential for faking old things is certainly increasing.
   ``Museum-trained experts have educated the public to look at old
things with more awareness. They have taught us that pieces without
major restoration and in pristine condition are more valuable,'' he
said.
   Although any piece of furniture that is 200 years old would
almost have to have some repairs, when virtually rebuilt, its claim
to age might be at least debatable, he said.
   Pennington says the growing public appetite for the country
antique look has led to many reproductions of decorative wares. The
advantage is that you can buy a reproduction much less expensively
than the real thing.
   But if the new piece isn't indelibly marked, eventually it will
probably make its way into the antiques trade. It's difficult to
tell age, especially after an item has acquired some of the patina
of age.
   He advises not to buy art from a stranger who calls you up on
the telephone. Buy from someone with a good reputation. Educate
yourself and beware of things that are too good to be true or
priced too low in comparison to the market.

   Once, those who could afford them invariably chose antiques over
reproductions. Nowadays, when the best original design is often
unavailable, too expensive, the wrong dimensions, or too fragile,
the reproduction can be the better choice.
   This change in thinking is due to a variety of factors. For one
thing, many reproductions now have more accurate finishes so they
don't stick out like a sore thumb when mixed with antiques. That
means mixing a little old with a lot of new is a good method of
getting the right look, less expensively.
   Second, an eclectic room is considered more desirable than the
completely accurate period room that was once was fashionable;
comfort has become more important than historical accuracy for many
people.
   Few decorators would hesitate to use plushly upholstered but
anachronistic seating in a historic room, especially since there
really was no comfortable American upholstery in the 18th century,
according to decorator Stanley Hura.
   In the dining room, an extension table of modern origin is often
a necessity. And in the traditional bedroom or family room that
lacks closets, installing a modern wall system may be the only
solution. Hura, for example, recently placed a floor-to-ceiling
wall system in an American traditional bedroom for needed storage
space. He gave the unit a built-in look by installing molding
around it, he said.
   When combining old and new furniture of more than one style, a
few precautions can prevent the pieces from clashing with one
another.
   Certain styles, even though from different periods, look good
together, says Hura. For example, Japanese, Shaker and Scandinavian
modern combine well. English Regency and Chinese furniture work
together. The rounded forms of the 18th-century French pieces and
art nouveau and Victorian also marry well.
   If you're furnishing a formal Victorian room and need storage,
remember that armoires are in character with that style. If you
have contemporary lacquered cabinetry, add Oriental or art deco
accessories and reproductions. At the windows you might choose
pleated shades or Shoji screens. Simple Regency chairs would not be
out of place in this room.
   ``The forms of the pieces dictate how they combine. You could
mix a 17th-century Italian table and chairs and contemporary
furniture and lamps because the lines work well together,'' Hura
says.
   Do-it-yourself decorators can learn their own taste preferences
by studying decorating books and magazines.
   ``The most appealing homes are the ones where people put
together what they love. The accurate period room is for museums,
not for living,'' says Hura.
   One of the marks of an interesting room is the unexpected
touches it contains, especially in the form of accessories.
According to Fran Laufer, who imports unusual accessories, colorful
and exotic items are in demand. For example, relatively affordable
Indian paintings on fabric known as pichwais and Burmese
embroideries are being selected by those seeking distinction
without breaking the bank.
   The decorators she deals with rarely take the item as shipped
and use it in a room. They further embellish it to make it more
important. For example, one decorator created an unusual wall
hanging from a large piece of Burmese embroidered fabric. She had
it stuffed to give it dimension and bring out its interesting
pattern, then mounted it on silk linen and framed it in gold leaf
before hanging it on a wall.
   Another decorator chose three colorful 22-inch Chinese porcelain
jardinieres. She had rosewood bases made for each one, set them in
place in a dining room and then had a one-inch thick glass top made
to cover them, creating a unique dining table.
   Designers often use antiquities such as etched bronze drums from
Thailand, old Korean vessels or wedding baskets from Indonesia as
cocktail table bases. Korean coin chests of a dark wood with iron
hardware become side tables with storage capacity and Coromandel
screens are turned into cabinet fronts.

   The first-home owner doesn't have to settle for make-do
furniture because of a budget, says a furnishings and design editor.
   ``Instead, start with flexible basics that will look terrific
right now, and also will make great building blocks for future
decorating schemes,'' says Denise L. Caringer, of Better Homes and
Gardens magazine.
   Don't settle for lower quality and don't feel locked into a look
or color scheme that will be difficult or costly to change later
on. Instead, she has these suggestions:
   _ Skip the busy wall coverings and fancy window wear. Instead,
slick up and unify the background with white paint, white window
blinds, shades or curtains, and, if possible, neutral floor
coverings.
   This will produce an airy, expansive look, and will also make a
neutral ``canvas'' on which style can be easily created.
   _ Avoid matching ``suites'' of furniture. Instead, choose a mix
of well-designed basics that can be shifted to other rooms or other
homes. A bedroom dresser, for example, has limited use, but an
armoire fits in virtually anywhere, she says.
   Consider modular storage pieces _ bookcases and stacking cubes _
with optional doors, drawers and shelves.
   _ Furnish a sitting spot with four wicker lounge chairs instead
of buying an expensive sofa for the living room. Float the chairs
in a cloverleaf-shaped grouping in the middle of the room and
anchor them with an area rug. Wicker is versatile, she says, so you
won't lock yourself into a changeless look. Fabric cushions can set
the mood.
   Later on, you can move them to a porch or split them up, using a
pair with a new sofa and moving the others to bedrooms.
   _ If the living room does not have a natural focal point, like a
great window or a fireplace, lean a second-hand fireplace surround
against the wall and fill the opening with plants, put two or three
low-cost white bookcases together, or place an antique bench or a
couple of low chests side by side and hang an oversized poster
above them.
   _ Stacked books next to a chair make a great resting place for a
cup or glass. Turn a cube, basket or a concrete block into a coffee
table by topping it with a piece of glass.
   _ Simple, well-designed lamps, such as flex arm architects
lamps, ceramic-base table lamps, or sleek metal floor lamps, can be
supplemented with clamp-on spotlights to highlight artwork and
canister-style uplights to wake up dull corners.
   _ For dining, a white outdoor table and casual chairs _ wicker,
molded plastic, metal, or wood-and-canvas _ serve as
``summer-house'' companions to the airy living room scheme. For a
more formal or traditional look, buy quality dining chairs and team
them with a round, skirted-to-the-floor dining table.
   _ Let your personality color the surroundings. Family photos?
Seashells? Books? Baskets? Group small treasures for a bigger
impact.

   ``I've never used a decorator because I like to be in control,
but I'm very aware of esthetics,'' says Boston stockbroker Ginny
Houston. So when she found a store that carried the unusual country
style furniture and accessories she prefers, she was delighted.
   She still prefers to make all the final decisions, but likes
having access to fabrics sold only through decorators and to
services such as drapery workrooms. ``It's a real time saver,''
says Houston, who is typical of a new breed of home furnishings
customers.
   They're sophisticated, well-traveled, affluent and aware of the
latest decorating styles. And they see no reason why they should be
denied access to some furniture and accessories because they prefer
not to hire a designer.
   To cater to this new breed, high-style furniture stores have
been opening in ever greater numbers across the country. These
stores are selling the public furnishings that formerly were
available mainly through designers and architects. Many also show
and sell the work of craftsmen, which otherwise would be
inaccessible.
   What started as a mere trickle has grown to a good-sized stream
not only in the largest population centers, but in smaller cities
all across the country _ stores like Urban Architecture in Detroit;
Oggi in Kansas City, Mo.; Current in Seattle; Verlaine in
Providence, R.I., and Luminaire in the Miami area.
   These retailers are breaking down former barriers, which may
lead to a revolution in furniture retailing, according to some
observers, by selling to both consumers and the trade, often
cutting prices below those of design showrooms, and by developing
alternative sources of supply among craftsmen and foreign
manufacturers.
   One example of the new style retailer is Keith Johnson who with
several partners founded Urban Architecture in Detroit. The store
carries high-style contemporary Italian design from Memphis Milano
and 15 other Italian manufacturers.
   ``When I got started in this business I hated the idea that the
public couldn't come in and that there was a double price system
for the furniture,'' says Johnson, who cut prices and sold to both
designers and the general public.
   His success proves there is a much larger market for advanced
furniture design than most people imagine, says the retailer.
   Lowering prices and putting the furniture on a retail sales
floor where anybody can come in and see it, he says, will make the
furniture as popular in the United States as it is in Europe, where
it usually sells for much less.
   ``I wanted to create a store for a new kind of customer, one for
whom the home is the status symbol of the 1990s,'' says Judy
George, who opened Domain in Chestnut Hill, Mass., in 1986. Since
then, Domain has grown to be a 10-store chain in New England and
more additions are planned.
   George says it's knowledge that defines her customers, not
necessarily affluence. ``Not all are rich, but they are all very
hip. They travel, like movies, read shelter magazines and usually
don't hire a decorator because they want to do it themselves,'' she
says.
   ``It's a small constituency, but a very savvy one,'' says Susan
Symonds, who started Verlaine in Providence about six years ago.
Access to the fabrics and wallcoverings normally available only
through decorators is so important to some customers that they call
Symonds from other areas of the country.
   ``These clients find it frustrating to see things in magazines
and then not to be able to buy them,'' says Symonds.
   If knowledge is one aspect of the new customer, lack of shopping
time is another, says George. So a store's edited version of
interesting new merchandise is a time saver.
   ``We are doing Russian, Gothic, French country, English chintz,
we've got rattan from Poland, we've got South American,'' says
George. ``This group appreciates ethnic furnishings and likes to
include something of their past in their home. But if I get too
serious, I don't sell it.''
   In fact, George and other retailers of this ilk rely on
different resources than the usual. She shops craft fairs to find
talented people and then gives them a large enough order to enable
them to set up production faculties. Currently, 10 artists in
Vermont and three in Maine make furnishings for Domain.
   Although the new-style stores have much in common withach is usually
a reflection of the passions of the
individual who started it, rather than of a management game plan.
Consequently, most change merchandise frequently as the owner finds
some new enthusiasm.

   Early 20th-century moderne is a look that is gaining in
popularity.
   Grounded primarily on neoclassical styles _ especially the
streamlined forms of art deco _ this versatile design theme results
in a room that is quieter and more pared down than the ubiquitous
country style.
   Yet, moderne is as adaptable as country and works well in both
the city and the country. By judicious selection of some of its
many elements, moderne style decorating can range from a
contemporary to a traditional room. It will add archite and
can be painted. There are a variety of reproduction patterns in the
Anaglypta and Lincrusta wallcovering lines which are manufactured
in England by Crown Relief Decorations.

rack module _ the Vintage Keeper _ that suspends the bottles in
transparent high impact thermoplastic that won't chip or crack from
normal use.
   A lattice-like configuration allows ambient air to circulate
freely about the bottles, contributing to their coolness. The open
design also inhibits condensate from forming on the cork, which can
cause seepage or mildew.

   Ever since Egypt's King Zoser built the Step Pyramid some 4,600
years ago, stone has been a sign of elegance and strength in the
field of building and furnishings.
   Egyptologists say Zoser's pyramid, the world's first major
building in stone, was considered a staircase to heaven. Some
modern designers say the use of stone simulations brings an touch
of richness and grace to the modern home.
   ``This is the age of faux finishes _ the look of marble, stone,
even wood achieved through creative techniques _ on everything from
walls and floors to fabrics and accessories,'' says designer Janet
Carter.
   ``The design emphasis for the 1990s is on texture and creating
an illusion of depth. The popularity of stone simulations has led
to numerous fabric and furnishing accessories that add distinction
and polish.''
   Carter adds that with today's new faux finishes, floors, walls
and furnishings can have the look and durability of stone without
the hassles.
   ``Simple painting techniques, for those even a little handy with
a paint brush, allow you to create the elegance of stone for one or
all walls in a room,'' explains Carter, a member of the Color
Marketing Group and American Society of Interior Designers.
   Real stone, from solid marble to delicate slate, she says, is
hard to care for, expensive to replace and often too heavy for
residential walls and floors.
   ``There is a strong trend toward contemporary designs in sheet
vinyl floors. Stripes, chevrons and banding combined with the look
of stone capture a contemporary elegance for any environment,''
says Gerald Ewan, director of styling for Mannington Resilient
Floors.
   Some designers note that while the look of stone may be classic,
the homeowner should remember not to get carried away with a trend.
   Stone looks can either make a strong statement on walls, floors
and furnishings, or create a subtle effect with accessories, linens
and pillows.
   ``Stone maintains its elegance when strategically placed to
complement its surroundings,'' says one industry observer.

   Bank of America lowered its prime lending
rate to 10.5 percent from 11 percent, only the second money center
bank to follow the lead of Chase Manhattan, which cut the benchmark

<HEAD>Stock Markets Rise On First Day Under New Trading System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain's stock markets rose Monday, the
first day of trading under a new system that introduced the most
sweeping changes in the exchange's 158-year-old history.
   The reform, known here as ``El Big Bang,'' is designed to
broaden the Spanish markets' trading base, tighten disclosure
controls to eliminate insider trading and bring the stock exchanges
in line with others in Europe.
   Provisional figures indicated the Madrid general index reached
303.93, up 1.70 over Friday. Valencia rose 1.76 points to 245.06
while Barcelona's index registered 106.47, up .73 points. The
Bilbao market was closed due to a regional holiday.
   Dealers said trading on the three exchanges remained light,
largely due to investors concern about the changeover process and
recent government moves to restrict credit and slow down the
country's overheated economy.
   ``Today was absolutely calm. There were no problems and the
market was up,'' said Jaime Sanz, spokesman for the Madrid Stock
Exchange, where about 70 percent of all Spanish trading takes place.
   In a ceremony Friday marking the last day of trading under the
old system, National Securities Commission President Luis Carlos
Croissier said the new market ``will be characterized by
transparency, greater technical capacity and competition.''
   The securities commission, set up nine months ago to implement
the June 1988 market reform law, is the markets' chief supervisory
and watchdog authority.
   The law, which took effect Saturday, converted the four
exchanges into private entities owned and managed by newly created
brokerages and broker-dealer companies.
   It eliminated civil servant stockbrokers' monopoly on trading
rights and eventually will integrate the stock exchanges in Madrid,
Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia into a single, computer automated
trading system.
   Fifty-one brokerages and broker-dealers have been registered on
the Madrid exchange, but analysts say half of them may disappear
within two years because of increased competition in the wake of
the reform.
   So far, 23 companies whose shares account for 22 percent of
trading volume have been listed on the computerized system, set up
in April and modeled after the one pioneered by the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
   Croissier has predicted that more than 50 percent of the total
trading volume in Spain would take place in the new system by the
end of the year.
   The old system, where prices are fixed in two daily open-outcry
sessions on the exchange floors, is to exist side by side with
continuous computerized trading until all shares switch over, Sanz
said.

   Consumer prices in the European Economic

month, the EEC reported Monday.
   The EEC's statistical agency Eurostat said prices were up 5.4

increase was 3.4 percent.
   In comparison, inflation over the last year for the United
States and Japan was 5.2 percent and 3 percent respectively.
   The EEC warned that that despite the moderate price increase in
June, inflation rates were ``clearly higher than in 1988'' for the
12 member states excluding Denmark, Greece and the Netherlands.
   The Eurostat price index, which uses 1985 as a base of 100,
stood at a provisional 116.4 in June.
   EC inflation was highest in Greece, at 1.6 percent in June.
Prices rose 0.7 percentage point in Portugal; 0.5 percentage point
in Spain; 0.5 percentage point in Italy; 0.3 percentage point in
Britain; 0.3 percentage point in Luxembourg; 0.2 percentage point

   The Japanese government reported Monday that a
record $5.17 billion in income was not reported by independent
business owners in fiscal 1987.
   The National Tax Administration Agency said it investigated
168,926 people nationwide, including doctors, lawyers and other

them reported their incomes incorrectly, either by mistake or for
tax evasion.
   The undeclared earnings discovered by the agency were 13.7
percent larger than in fiscal 1986, the agency said. Fiscal 1987
ended on March 31, 1988.
   The agency said it levied a record $1.36 billion in penalty
fines, up 18.4 percent from 1986.
   Owners of pinball parlors topped the 1987 list of tax evaders
with an average $270,000 in unreported income, followed by hospital
owners, with an average $115,000 and real estate businesses with
$93,000, the agency said.

   The stock market was little changed today,
starting off a new week on a hesitant note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.89 to 2,633.35
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 10 to 9 in the early tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 493 up, 444 down and
509 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.94 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets today amid talk
that the Federal Reserve might soon move to relax its credit policy
further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose nearly $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 7.95
percent-7.98 percent range.
   Analysts said sentiment about the interest-rate outlook got a
noticeable boost last week when Treasury bond yields went below the
8 percent level, continuing their descent from well above 9 percent
earlier in the year.
   However, stock traders appeared a bit wary of adding to their
positions today with some of the broader market indicators having
climbed to record highs last week.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose { to 40|; McDonald's gained [ to 30{; International Business
Machines added | to 114, and USX dropped { to 36[.
   Chrysler Corp. rose ] to 24\. The company reported
second-quarter earnings of $1.46 a share, up from $1.45 in the like
period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 190.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .07 at 374.44.

<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp.'s second-quarter
earnings jumped nearly 22 percent because of sales gains
internationally and higher prices domestically, the leading U.S.
appliance maker reported Monday.
   Whirlpool reported earnings of $50.4 million, or 72 cents a
share, for the three months ended June 30, up from $41.4 million,
or 60 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1988.
   Revenue for the period totaled $1.64 billion vs. $1.15 billion.
   For the first six months of 1989, Whirlpool reported earnings of
$91.1 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenues of $3.21 billion, up
from $74.6 million, or $1.08 a share, on revenues of $2.22 billion.
   Whirlpool became the world's largest appliance company in
January when it purchased a 53 percent interest in the appliance
division of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, forming Whirlpool
International.
   Chairman David R. Whitwam said the second quarter also brought a
strong performance by Whirlpool's Brazilian affiliates, which had
suffered losses in the first quarter attributed to unsettled
economic conditions.

   Xerox Corp., the world's leading maker of
copy machines, reported a 7 percent gain in second-quarter earnings
Monday, attributing the improvement to a restructuring plan.
   Earnings totaled $179 million or $1.67 per share for the
April-June quarter, vs. $167 million or $1.59 a share a year
earlier. Revenues totaled $4.4 billion vs. $4.1 billion, an 8
percent gain.
   ``These results indicate we are on track toward achieving our
goals fo 1989,'' Chairman David T. Kearns said. ``Improved
financial returns from business products and systems in this year's
second half and in the years beyond will result from the
restructuring program we announced in January, plus our continuing
emphasis on customer satisfaction and tight cost controls.''
   For the first six months, the company earned $337 million, or
$3.15 a share, compared with $319 million, or $2.96 a share, in the
same period a year ago.
   Revenues were up 8 percent in the first half to $8.5 billion
compared witho $7.9 billion in the first six months of 1988.
   Under the restructuring plan, Xerox will eliminate 2,000 jobs by
the end of the year.

   Stock prices hovered in a narro range today,
starting off a new week on a hesitant note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.22 to 2,632.02
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 613 up, 579 down and 533
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.06 million shares at
midmorning.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets today amid talk
that the Federal Reserve might soon move to relax its credit policy
further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose nearly $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 7.95
percent-7.98 percent range.
   Analysts said sentiment about the interest-rate outlook got a
noticeable boost last week when Treasury bond yields went below the
8 percent level, continuing their descent from well above 9 percent
earlier in the year.
   However, stock traders appeared a bit wary of adding to their
positions today with some of the broader market indicators having
climbed to record highs last week.
   Chrysler Corp. rose [ to 24. The company reported second-quarter
earnings of $1.46 a share, up from $1.45 in the like period last
year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .06 to 190.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .56 at 373.95.

<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after becoming the first major Texas
bank to be recapitalized with federal assistance, BancTexas Group
Inc. is seeking another government bailout.
   The request made Friday comes one week after the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. seized Texas American Bancshares Inc. and National
Bancorp. of Texas Inc., awarding them to new owners. The FDIC said
at the time the move took care of major bank restructuring in Texas.
   BancTexas Group last week reported an $8.8 million loss in the
second quarter, compared to an $11.12 million loss in the same
period last year. So far this year, the bank has lost $14.78
million, compared to $17.02 million last year.
   The losses dropped the holding company's primary capital ratio
on June 30 to 5.3 percent, with BancTexas-Dallas at 2.3 percent,
well below the required 5.5 percent. The Dallas bank accounts for
about half of the company's $776.29 million in assets.
   Other subsidiary banks are BancTexas-Houston, with a capital
ratio of 5.9 percent, and BancTexas-McKinney, at 4.9 percent.
   ``This application contemplates that, in conjunction with FDIC
financial assistance, BancTexas Group and outside investors would
make a substantial capital infusion into BancTexas-Dallas,'' the
company said.
   ``If assistance is granted by the FDIC to BancTexas-Dallas,
BancTexas Group should be able to assist the other two banks in
meeting the new ... capital requirements.''
   Chairman Nathan C. Collins said, ``while it is not possible at
this time to predict the exact effect on the stockholders of
BancTexas Group, it is probable that, if the assistance is granted,
their interest will be substantially diluted as a result of the new
capital injection.''
   BancTexas was recapitalized in 1987 with $150 million in federal
assistance, plus $50 million from the Hallwood Group Inc., a
Cleveland-based investment firm.
   At the time, that seemed as if it would be enough, but
continuing deterioration of the state's real estate market
undermined the bank's recovery, bank spokesman Jim Miller said.
   The bank said it had $64.12 million in non-performing assets on
June 30, with $24.75 million allowance for loan losses. The company
charged $10 million worth of bad loans during the quarter.
   About a third of the bank's portfolio is in real estate, Miller
said.
   BancTexas has been sounding warning signals for about nine
months, Miller said. Earlier, the bank has acknowledged talking to
outside groups in search of additional capital.
   The bank, however, has declined to comment on reports other
banks were reviewing its books. The Dallas Morning News has
reported Hibernia Corp., a Louisiana holding company, was invited
to study the bank's books.

   US Sprint said Monday it will begin offering a
Braille long-distance calling card as an aid to the blind and
visually impaired.
   All numbers necessary to complete a call are embossed on the
card in two lines of Braille, the company said. The customer code
number and calling instructions also are printed on the back of the
card normally so a sighted person can assist the customer if needed.
   Dialing and access instructions will be sent in a Braille letter
with the card. Sprint spokeswoman Terri Dunn said the company
expected there would be about 50,000 to 60,000 potential customers
for the card.
   Sprint said there is no extra charge for the Braille version of
its Foncard, which also offers free directory assistance and free
over-the-phone bill review.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, the Braille Foncard is the first
credit card suited to the needs of the blind and partially
sighted,'' said Lawrence L. Lake, US Sprint senior vice president
product management.
   The Kansas City, Mo.-based company said it developed the Braille
calling card following a customer request. The company solicited
advice and suggestions from schools and organizations serving the
blind and partially sighted.
   Braille is a printing system in which characters are formed by
patterns of raised dots felt with the fingers.

<HEAD>Weekend Rain Sends Crop Futures Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The soybean and corn markets led grain futures
prices lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting unexpectedly heavy rainfall in the Midwest over the
weekend.
   Soybean futures fell as much as 14\ cents a bushel and corn lost
up to 6} cents a bushel before scattered buying lifted the markets
off their opening lows.
   Many areas of the Corn Belt received one-half inch to two inches
of rain during the weekend, with particularly heavy amounts
reported in southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, northern Illinois
and parts of Missouri.
   Drier weather is expected in the corn-and-soybean region this
week, but some forecasters are calling for more rain before the
weekend.
   On Friday, the National Weather Service issued 30- and 90-day
forecasts that suggested above-average rainfall for the Mississippi
Delta region _ where rain is not needed _ and for the Corn Belt
during the fall harvest period.
   But analysts were skeptical.
   ``The 90-day forecast indicated possible harvest delays, but you
can't really hang your hat on that,'' said Steve Freed, a
grain-market analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.86{ a bushel;
corn was 3 cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.24{ a
bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 5 cents lower with September at
$1.31{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 13 cents lower with
August at $6.36 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August
at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .50 cent
higher with August at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with August at 45.92 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at 25.62
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

   China's airline administration said Monday it was
cutting prices on 71 domestic routes by 20 percent through December
in an effort to attract more passengers.
   Ticket prices to Hong Kong and abroad will not be reduced, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, which runs China's regional and
international airlines.
   The announcement said only that the aim was to ``lure more
passengers.'' It said the number of people flying on China's
airlines fell by half a million in June over the previous June, and
that the number of foreign travelers was down 54 percent over the
same period. It did not give the actual number of travelers.
   More than 4.3 million tourists visited China in 1988 on
organized tours alone, and millions more came individually. But
tourism has virtually halted since the army crushed a student-led
pro-democracy movement June 3-4.
   The number of Chinese travelers also has dropped as the
government has ordered a cutback in the number of regional and
national meetings, which in the past often were an excuse for
jaunts to scenic cities.
   Some cities' branches of the state-run tour agency have
announced discounts of up to 20 percent on package tour rates, and
individual hotels in Beijing and many other cities are offering
off-season rates and other specials. A few hotels have virtually
shut down.
   The Beijing Tourism Administration also has ordered hotels to
cut their staffs' salaries by up to 25 percent to compensate for
the loss of guests.

   Several major commercial banks including the
nation's largest lowered their prime lending rates a half
percentage point today to 10.5 percent, signaling lower borrowing
costs for consumers and businesses.
   First Bank of Chicago was the first to take the step shortly
before the opening of the stock market, with Chemical Bank,
Continenal Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., Bankers Trust Co. and No. 1 Citibank joining in.
   The reduction, effective immediately, follows similar cuts by
San Francisco-based Bank of America on Friday and Chase Manhattan
Bank more than three weeks ago. A few other smaller banks have
reduced their prime rates since Chase's move.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,
including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates of
deposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.
   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types
of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates are not
included in that category.
   Today's decrease was widely expected by most economists due to
continuing signs that the Federal Reserve is seeking looser credit
policies in response to a slowdown in economic growth.
   Economists have speculated that major banks did not immediately
follow Chase, which cut its prime rate on July 10, partly because
they wanted to determine whether the Fed would keep pursuing lower
interest rates.
   ``The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too early
and everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayed
below 9 percent,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist with
Dean Wittter Reynolds Inc.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8~ percent by late morning today, down from 8
15-16 percent Friday. The Fed controls the rate by adding or
subtracting banking reserves.
   Other interest rates in the credit markets have been falling
steadily. The yield on the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond
finished below 8 percent Friday for the first time since Spring
1987, closing at 7.985. It traded lower at 7.95 percent by late
morning today as bond prices rose.
   Stock prices, however, were down slightly in late-morning
trading.
   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. It was
raised twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a half
percentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changing
concerns about economic growth and inflation.

<TEXT>
   A three-week national dockworkers strike foundered
Monday as more laborers returned to their jobs after employers
threatened to fire those who didn't resume work.
   But 480 dockers at Bristol went against the national trend when
they voted at a private meeting to continue to stay out over
government plans to abolish guaranteed lifelong employment.
   Port employers said the returns on Monday meant that 3,668, or
57 percent, of dockers affected by the job guarantee program were
working and 2,741 remained on strike. Forty of the 60 ports
affected by the strike were working normally, they said.
   ``Clearly more than 50 percent of dockers are back at work. They
have voted with their feet and I hope the Transport and General
Workers' Union will heed their wishes and call off this strike,''
said Nick Finney, director of the National Association of Port
Employers.
   But opposition Labor Party lawmaker Michael Meacher said Sunday
on British Broadcasting Corp. radio: ``The reason is not lack of
support for the cause, but the intimidation and blackmail involved
in threats of sackings.''
   The swing away from the strike came after dockers' leaders voted
decisively on Friday to intensify the dispute and try to get
working dockers to rejoin the strike.
   John Connolly, the union's national docks secretary, said Sunday
the votes to return to work were ``disappointing but not totally
unexpected.''
   They would not affect the union's decision to step up the
dispute, he said, adding: ``We will continue to try to persuade
those members who have returned to change their minds.''

<HEAD>Eastern Losses Leave Texas Air with $109.3 Million Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., parent of strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines, reported today a $109.3 million second-quarter
loss as revenue fell 34.4 percent.
   Houston-based Texas Air said the loss on $1.4 billion in revenue
compared with a $364.9 million loss on revenue of $3.3 billion in
the same quarter last year.
   The company said that Eastern, which is under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, lost $129.3 million on revenue of $89.6
million during the quarter ended June 30, despite a $250 million
gain from the sale of its Northeast shuttle to developer Donald
Trump.
   In the same quarter last year, Miami-based Eastern lost $89.8
million on revenue of $1 billion.
   Eastern also incurred costs of $17.2 million in the quarter
because of its reorganization, Texas Air said.
   In the first half of this year, Eastern has lost $384.5 million
on revenue of $710.2 million, compared with a loss of $120.8
million on revenue of $2 billion in the first six months of 1988.
   Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other major subsidiary, posted
net income of $32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion. That
compares with a net loss of $150.9 million in the same quarter last
year.
   In the first half, Continental had net income of $15.6 million
on $2.5 billion in revenue, compared with last year's $231.5
million loss on $2.2 billion in revenue.
   Last year's results include a $131 million accounting charge
against Continental's income.

number of working oil and gas rigs by 40 to total 870 this week,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The rig count remained lower than the comparable period a year
ago, when it totaled 894. Last week, the rig count jumped 10 to
total 830.
   During the last nine weeks, the rig count has increased eight
times.
   ``About 25 of that increase of 40 was attributed to ground
drying out in the Ark-La-Tex region,'' said Ike Kerridge, Baker
Hughes vice president. The Ark-La-Tex region includes northern
Louisiana and northeastern Texas.
   ``Wet grounds makes it impossible to move rigs,'' Kerridge said.
``If you're out in the middle of a corn field you just can't move
the rigs and you have to wait for the ground to dry.''
   Tropical Storm Allison caused widespread flooding in Texas and
Louisiana in June. And Monday, Tropical Storm Chantal was in the
Gulf of Mexico and could cause more heavy rains in the area,
Kerridge said.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.

<HEAD>Chrysler Second-Quarter Earnings Up 6.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Monday that sales of minivans
and Jeeps pushed second-quarter profits 6.6 percent higher than a
year earlier, when incentive costs hurt earnings.
   Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said deep cost cuts, including
eliminating 2,300 white-collar jobs by the end of the year, should
help Chrysler meet stiffening competition in the automotive market
later this year.
   Chrysler said it earned $341 million, or $1.46 a share, for the
three months ended June 30, compared with $320 million, or $1.45 a
share, in the same 1988 period.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $10.1 billion, up from $9.34
billion a year ago, the country's third-largest automaker said.
   The increases contrasted with last week's reports of a 3.4
percent quarterly decline in earnings at GM and a 15.4 percent drop
at Ford. But Chrysler was comparing with a weak second quarter in
1988.
   ``They had very poor profit last year. They were pushing heavily
on incentives, and their mix of models was weak,'' said automotive
analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   For the first six months of the year, Chrysler reported earnings
of $692 million, or $2.96 a share, on revenue of $20.1 billion.
That was up from $504 million, or $2.27 a share, on revenue of
$17.9 billion in the first half of 1988.
   Chrysler said incentive costs are still rising, by 20 percent
over the year-earlier period.
   This year, Chrysler said Jeep sales were up 19 percent from last
year's second quarter and the company continued its dominance in
the sale of minivans, commanding 54 percent of sales.
   Iacocca said sales were helped by the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth
Acclaim models that replaced Chrysler's K-series compact cars, and
by more expensive models such as the Chrysler New Yorker Landau.
   The company increased rebates to help lagging sales of
lower-priced models such as the Plymouth Sundance, Dodge Shadow,
Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni.
   Iacocca predicted gains from last week's move to cut $1 billion
in costs by year end by deeply cutting Chrysler's white-collar work
force.
   ``We've got aggressive internal cost-control measures in place,
and we plan to continue strong emphasis on cost reductions as a
means of enhancing our competitive position,'' he said. ``These
moves will help us face head on the most competitive automotive
market the world has ever seen.''
   Healy said the cost cuts may not help soon, however. ``I don't
think they'll have much effect on 1989 profits. I think they can
bring the savings on stream during the course of 1990,'' he said.
   GM reported second-quarter earnings of $1.45 billion and Ford
said it earned $1.4 billion.
   Chrysler's earnings brought Big Three profits to $3.20 billion
for the quarter, down from last year's second-quarter total of
$3.49 billion and record first-quarter 1989 profits of $3.54
billion for the three.
   Each of the Big Three has spent hundreds of dollars per vehicle
on incentives during the second quarter to try to boost sales and
shrink inventories in a sluggish car and truck market.
   Chrysler said last week it was spending about $700 per car. Ford
said it spent $600 to $700 per car on incentives during the second
quarter. GM declined to say what it spent but said it exceeded
1988's spending of about $700 per car.

   Corn and soybean futures prices closed strongly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a weekend of
unexpectedly heavy rain in some of the driest parts of the Midwest.
   ``Rain makes grain,'' said Jerry Gidel, research director for
the futures brokerage LIT American Inc.
   Soybeans for near-month delivery fell to a new 16-month low
around $6.25 a bushel under steady selling pressure.
   Heavy precipitation was reported during the weekend in Missouri,
northern Iowa, southern Minnesota and northern Illinois, with
amounts ranging from { inch to 2 inches.
   Drier, warmer weather was expected for most of this week but
private forecasters predicted more showers in the Corn Belt by this
weekend.
   Long-range forecasts hold a threat of a rain-hampered harvest
this fall, ``but you can't really hang your hat on that,'' said
Steve Freed, a grain-market analyst in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.84\ a bushel; corn was 2\

<HEAD>Study: Most Thrifts Meet Tougher Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 75 percent of the nation's thrifts already
meet tougher capital standards proposed in the government's
multibillion-dollar bailout bill, according to a study released
Monday.
   The study by Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Co., an Austin-based consulting
firm, said the findings show that ``clearly, this requirement isn't
an unbearable burden for the healthy segment of the savings and
loan industry.''
   Congress is scheduled this week to consider a $157 billion
bailout bill for the industry, which is losing an estimated $20
million a day. Among other components, the bill requires thrifts to
have a 3 percent capital-to-assets ratio.
   The bill allows half of the capital initially to be in so-called
goodwill, or intangible, assets. By Jan. 1, 1995, the entire 3
percent must be in tangible assets.
   The bill has been approved by a House-Senate conference
committee, but Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has threatened to block
passage in a dispute over financing.
   Sheshunoff said his review of the financial status of the
nation's 2,946 thrifts found 73 percent, or 2,163, already meet the
3 percent core capital requirement contained in the Bush
administration's bailout bill.
   In addition, Sheshunoff said 1,984 of the thrifts, or 67
percent, can meet the 1995 requirement with tangible assets only.
   Whie 25 of the nation's 40 largest thrifts _ including 12 of the
top 13 _ already meet the 1995 standard, the number drops to 12 _
including eight of the top 13 _ if only tangible assets are counted.
   Sheshunoff said that of the 1,984 well-capitalized S&amp;Ls, the
average tangible capital-to-assets ratio is 6 percent, which ``puts
them in a strong position to acquire undercapitalized thrifts.''
   ``The difference between the higher interest rates paid by S&amp;Ls
for deposits and those paid by banks should narrow,'' Sheshunoff
said of the bailout bill. ``As a result, borrowers, particularly
homebuyers, may see a decline in interest costs on mortgages.''
   Of the 2,163 thrifts with more than 3 percent capital,
Sheshunoff said 1,886, or 87.2 percent, were profitable. Of the 783
that don't meet the 3 percent standard, 277, or 35.4 percent, were
profitable.
   Sheshunoff based his study on data in the March 31, 1989, Thrift
Financial Reports of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

<HEAD>To Sell Two Information Systems Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Monday it will
sell two of its information systems businesses and convert its
Systems International unit into a public company headquartered in
the United Kingdom.
   The company said it has reached a preliminary agreement to sell
Network Systems, which includes the Tymnet public data network, to
British Telecom for $355 million. The sale is conditional on
regulatory clearances.
   McDonnell Douglas also said it intended to sell its North
American field service business later this year.
   McDonnell Douglas announced in June it had reached an agreement
to sell its Telecheck business. The annual revenues of the three
units are about $400 million, the company said. The proceeds are to
be used to reduce debt and raise money for the aerospace businesses.
   The company said Jeremy Causley, the current president of
McDonnell Douglas Intormation Systems Co., will become chief
executive of the British venture and will make arrangements to
partly divest it.
   The present McDonnell Douglas computer systems business in the
United States will become part of the international company, a
spokesman said.
   The company said it considered the announced changes to be the
last step in narrowing its information systems business. For the
first six months of 1989, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems
posted revenues of $559 million and reported earnings of $9 million.

<HEAD>Coors Discussing Purchase of Part of Stroh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co., the nation's No. 4
brewing company, is holding discussions with the Stroh Brewing Co.,
the No. 3 beer-maker, that could lead to Coors becoming a minority
partner, company officials said Monday.
   Details of the discussions were unavailable. Coors vice
president of development Robert Klugman said the talks were
preliminary.
   ``Because we have no agreements, we are not able to comment
further,'' said Anita Russell, a spokeswoman for the Golden-based
brewery.
   Jack Barthwell, vice president of corporate communications and
government affairs for the Detroit-based Stroh, said in a statement
that the discussions are part of an effort launched by Stroh in
February to explore partnership opportunities.
   Stroh in February hired Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``to find someone
to buy a minority position in the company,'' Barthwell said in a
telephone interview.
   He said the talks with Coors are part of that process, which has
involved discussions with other international brewers as well.
   ``Although we will confirm that discussions have occurred with
representatives from Coors, it should be clearly understood that
nothing discussed with Coors would cause Stroh to alter its
schedule of meetings with other brewers,'' Barthwell said in his
statement.
   ``As previously stated, Stroh will continue exploring numerous
alternatives to profitably restructure and strengthen its business,
regardless of rumors and speculation,'' his statement said.
   Stroh is privately owned and does not release production or
earnings figures. Besides making Stroh beer products, the brewery
also produces Old Milwaukee, Schlitz and Schaefer beer.
   Coors in April announced a first-quarter loss of $4.8 million,
compared with a $3.7 million profit, or 10 cents per share, during
the same period of 1988. It was Coors' first loss in its 15 years
as a public company. The company blamed a drop in beer shipments
and higher manufacturing costs for the loss.
   During this year's first quarter, Coors' net sales were up 12.9
percent, to $324 million. Beer shipments during the period totaled
3 million barrels, down 5.5 percent.

   Taxes raise not just revenues but outrage and
threats too, as well as inspiring wits, wags, philosophers,
politicians and liars.
   Will Rogers said the tax system generates more liars than the
game of golf, and Edmund Burke said man can be no more successful
about taxes than love. It goes that way all the way back to the
Greeks and Romans.
   More currently, when the politics of taxation arise some of the
most extreme claims ever made are heard from taxpayers who
otherwise stick to the facts.
   Everyone has heard them: The rich live off the taxes of the
poor, the rich pay no taxes, the middle class pays most of the
taxes, the poor are taxed disproportionately high.
   Seeking facts rather than assumptions, the nonpartisan Tax
Foundation went back through Treasury Department and Internal
Revenue Service records and came to this conclusion:``The top
earning half of the population continues to pay well over 90
percent of the Federal individual income tax bill.''
   In spite of numerous changes in the law, the percentage has held
for at least a decade.
   The foundation found that in 1987, 43 percent of all federal
income taxes were paid by the highest 5 percent of taxpayers, a
significant increase from the 37.6 percent in 1979. More than half
the taxes were paid by the top 10 percent, and almost 77 percent by
the highest 25 percent, based on adjusted gross income.
   In contrast, the lowest 50 percent paid less than 6 percent of
taxes in 1987.
   The system, it concludes, remains progressive. In fact,
statistics show it might have grown more even more so, because the
lowest half of the income scale paid more than 7 percent of taxes
in 1979 and less than that in 1987.
   That takes care of the rich and poor _ but what about the
middle-income class? It is in this area that the statistics can do
an injustice, and every person who considers himself or herself to
be middle class will tell you so.
   The main reason for confusion here is the simple phrase ``or
more.'' It means that those in the top 5 percent of income are in
an open-ended category that ranges all the way from $71,125 to
scores of millions of dollars.
   Drop down to the next lower category and the point becomes
clearer. Those earning $54,700 or more paid 55.4 percent of all
taxes paid in 1987. But, an income of $54,700, the foundation
points out, is hardly ``fat cat'' status.
   It comments, ``It still takes millions of basically middle and
upper-middle income taxpayers to pay the bulk of the total income
tax bill.''
   But hold on. Such categories, neat and specific though they be,
are really a cause of confusion. Those making $34,260 a year might
be middle-class statistically, but many of them consider themselves
poor in regard to others.
   The term is subjective. A recent college graduate, still single,
might think $34,260 a year is excellent compensation. A middle-age
parent funding college tuitions might think it a starvation wage.
   For tax purposes, almost all people are poor, not statistically,
perhaps, but certainly in their own minds.

game of golf, and Edmund Burke said man can be no more successful
about taxes than love. It goes that way all the way back to the
Greeks and Romans.
   More currently, when the politics of taxation arise some of the
most extreme claims ever made are heard from taxpayers who
otherwise stick to the facts.
   Everyone has heard them: The rich live off the taxes of the
poor, the rich pay no taxes, the middle class pays most of the
taxes, the poor are taxed disproportionately high.
   Seeking facts rather than assumptions, the nonpartisan Tax
Foundation went back through Treasury Department and Internal
Revenue Service records and came to this conclusion:``The top
earning half of the population continues to pay well over 90
percent of the Federal individual income tax bill.''
   In spite of numerous changes in the law, the percentage has held
for at least a decade.
   The foundation found that in 1987, 43 percent of all federal
income taxes were paid by the highest 5 percent of taxpayers, a
significant increase from the 37.6 percent in 1979. More than half
the taxes were paid by the top 10 percent, and almost 77 percent by
the highest 25 percent, based on adjusted gross income.
   In contrast, the lowest 50 percent paid less than 6 percent of
taxes in 1987.
   The system, it concludes, remains progressive. In fact,
statistics show it might have grown more even more so, because the
lowest half of the income scale paid more than 7 percent of taxes
in 1979 and less than that in 1987.
   That takes care of the rich and poor _ but what about the
middle-income class? It is in this area that the statistics can do
an injustice, and every person who considers himself or herself to
be middle class will tell you so.
   The main reason for confusion here is the simple phrase ``or
more.'' It means that those in the top 5 percent of income are in
an open-ended category that ranges all the way from $71,125 to
scores of millions of dollars.
   Drop down to the next lower category and the point becomes
clearer. Those earning $54,700 or more paid 55.4 percent of all
taxes paid in 1987. But, an income of $54,700, the foundation
points out, is hardly ``fat cat'' status.
   It comments, ``It still takes millions of basically middle and
upper-middle income taxpayers to pay the bulk of the total income
tax bill.''
   But hold on. Such categories, neat and specific though they be,
are really a cause of confusion. Those making $34,260 a year might
be middle-class statistically, but many of them consider themselves
poor in regard to others.
   The term is subjective. A recent college graduate, still single,
might think $34,260 a year is excellent compensation. A middle-age
parent funding college tuitions might think it a starvation wage.
   For tax purposes, almost all people are poor, not statistically,
perhaps, but certainly in their own minds.

   President Bush on Monday vetoed legislation to
impose conditions on the U.S.-negotiated deal to coproduce an
advanced jet fighter with the Japanese, saying it would damage
prospects for an agreement.
   ``I cannot accept binding provisions ... that would tie my hands
in the exercise of my constitutional responsibilities,'' Bush said
in a veto message.
   He said the legislation would inject the General Accounting
Office, an agency of the legislative branch, into the
administration of the jet program ``in a highly intrusive manner,''
trespassing on the constitutional powers of the president.
   ``To reopen discussions now for additional and needless changes
can only damage the prospects for a successful agreement,'' the
president said.
   ``If this occurs, substantial injury to the U.S.-Japan security
relationship is likely and the considerable stragetic and
commercial benefits to the United States will be lost. This
compromising of U.S. interests is simply not acceptable.''
   The agreement, negotiated earlier this year by Bush
administration officials with officials of the Japanese government,
called for development by General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, named FSX,
which was to be deployed by Japan in the 1990s. The deal envisioned
a $6 billion pricetag.
   A House measure to restrict the deal was passed in early June on
a 262-155 vote. But that was far less than the two-thirds margin of
290 needed to override a veto in the 435-member chamber. An
identical Senate resolution passed 72-27 on May 16.
   The administration already had agreed to develop the fighter
jointly with Japan. The measure passed in the House June 7 sought
to stipulate the U.S. negotiating position in future talks on how
the FSX would actually be produced.
   Opponents of the FSX deal as negotiated by the Bush
administration said that it amounted to a giveaway of critical U.S.
defense technology. But the administration argued at the time that
the restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks.
   The legislation stated that any agreement on coproduction of the
FSX should guarantee that at least 40 percent of the work _
including provision of spare parts _ would be handled by American
companies.
   It also sought to prohibit transfer to Japan of critical
American jet engine technology and bar Japan from selling to third
countries the FSX or any of the plane's major subcomponents.
   There was no immediate indication Monday of why Bush vetoed the
bill, although it was said to have been spelled out in the letter
to various lawmakers. No copies of the letter were immediately
available on Capitol Hill.
   But two members of Congress immediately said they would fight to
override the veto.
   ``With his veto of the bipartisan bill to safeguard America's
interests in the FSX deal with Japan, President Bush is giving away
our best technology and our best jobs,'' House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said in a statement.
   Gephardt said that Bush gave short-shrift consideration to the
impact the FSX deal would have on the U.S. economy and on American
workers in particular.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said the veto ``signaled to the
world that the United States will not flex its muscle to protect
the American worker.''
   If Japan is serious about softening its trade surplus with the
United States, it would buy F-16s directly from U.S. makers, he
said. But he noted a series of trade barriers Japan erects to
American agriculture and electronic equipment.
   ``We can't tell the rest of the world we're tough on trade if
we're cutting sweetheart deals with the very same people who break
the rules,'' he said. ``I'm committed to overriding this veto.''

   The stock market climbed to new post-crash highs
Monday, propelled by computer-program buying and falling interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 25.42 points to
2,660.66, its highest close since it stood at 2,662.95 on Aug. 31,
1987. Several other, broad market indicators surpassed record highs
they reached last week.
   The Dow finished July with a net gain of 220.60 points, for its
strongest monthly performance since it soared 252.09 points in
January of 1987.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets Monday amid talk
that the Federal Reserve might soon relax its credit policy further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 7.91
percent-7.94 percent range.
   Analysts said sentiment about the interest-rate outlook got a
noticeable boost last week when Treasury bond yields went below the
8 percent level, continuing their descent from well above 9 percent
earlier in the year.
   In addition, numerous large banks across the country lowered
their prime lending rates today from 11 percent to 10.5 percent,
joining in a move begun a few weeks earlier by New York's Chase
Manhattan Bank.
   Much of the day's gains came in two rounds of buying ascribed to
activity by professionals engaged in computer-program strategies
involving stocks and stock-index futures and options.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,054 up, 490 down and 462 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.65 million
shares, down from 180.61 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 199.86 million shares.
   Coca-Cola picked up 4{ to 68 on word that investor Warren
Buffett, who holds a 6.75 percent stake in the company, is seeking
clearance to buy as much as 15 percent of the stock.
   Chrysler Corp. rose { to 24]. The company reported
second-quarter earnings of $1.46 a share, up from $1.45 in the like
period last year.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
gained { to 40|; International Business Machines 1| to 115; Philip
Morris 3{ to 158{, and General Electric 1 to 58{.
   Bank stocks were strong as well. J.P. Morgan rose 1\ to 41[;
Bankamerica 1\ to 32; Manufacturers Hanover 1] to 43]; Bankers
Trust New York 1~ to 55\, and NCNB { to 53{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $33.44 billion, or
1.00 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.03 to 192.41.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.37 to 395.68, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.93 at 346.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.02 to 453.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 376.56, up 2.05.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise on Storm Worries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rose Monday amid concern
that a storm in the Gulf of Mexico could disrupt oil production off
the Louisana and Texas coasts.
   Speculation that crude oil shipments from the Mideast might be
interrupted depending on how the United States retaliates for the
reported hanging of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins also drove up oil
prices.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 38 cents to $18.31 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for
delivery in months further in the future posted similar gains.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
August contract of unleaded gasoline increased 0.53 cent to 53.48
cents a gallon. It was the last trading day for the August unleaded
gas contract. The September contract, which becomes the near-month
contract on Tuesday, spurted 1.15 cents to 52.70 cents a gallon.
   The August delivery No.2 heating oil contract settled 0.44 cent
higher at 48.67 cents a gallon. It also was the last trading day
for the August heating oil contract. September heating oil
increased 0.49 cent to 49.31 cents a gallon.
   Linda Simard, an energy broker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said reports that some oil companies were suspending operations and
evacuating employees from certain installations in the Gulf of
Mexico due to a storm motivated buying in the energy futures pits.
   ``The main thing today was the tropical storm on the Gulf
Coast,'' said Simard. ``People are taking precautions.''
   Tropical storm Chantal, expected to be upgraded to a hurricane,
was reported to be threatening the Louisiana and Texas coasts.
   Although it was unknown how the Bush administration would
respond to the reported hanging of Higgins, energy brokers bought
on the possibility that oil shipments from the Middle East might be
disrupted, Simard said.
   Pro-Iranian captors of Higgins said they hanged him in
retaliation for Israel's abduction of a Moslem cleric. President
Bush cut short a two-day trip and returned to Washington to deal
with the matter.

   Lower U.S. interest rates sapped strength Monday
from the dollar, which fell to springtime levels against major
foreign currencies.
   The drop in interest rates has wiped out the dollar rally that
reached its peak in June, taking the dollar back to levels of May
against the British pound and Japanese yen, April against the West
German mark and March against the Swiss franc.
   The dollar's sharpest drop came against the yen, which has
surged ahead following the brief decline that occurred in the July
political upheaval. Traders said there was optimism that Japan's
governing partner would select a new prime minister shortly.
   Most of the dollar's decline came in Europe. Trading in the
United States was thin and choppy, with most interbank trading
ending by noon because of end-of-the-month squaring of the books.
   The Federal Reserve has been lowering interest rates to
encourage borrowing and stimulate the sluggish U.S. economy. As a
side effect, the lower rates make dollar-denominated securities
less attractive to global investors.
   The dollar did not seem to gain from the crisis atmosphere
surrounding claims by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in Lebanon that
they executed an American military officer. Often the dollar is
seen as a safe haven in times of international trouble.
   ``People are still concerned with interest rates coming off,''
said Michael Miskulin, a trader at Industrial Bank of Japan Trust
Co. in New York. As for the Lebanon situation, ``I think people are
used to that sort of situation now,'' he said.
   The yen's climb began in Asia Monday, triggered by a large order
to sell marks for yen in Singapore.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before European markets
open, the dollar fell 1.05 yen to close at 138.40 Japanese yen.
Later, in London, the dollar fell to 136.95 yen. In New York the
dollar closed at 137 yen, down from 139.20 on Friday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6665 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6455 late Friday.
In New York the pound rose to $1.6655 from $1.6527 on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8650 West German marks, down from 1.8815; 1.6080
Swiss francs, down from 1.6175; 1.1811 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1826; 6.3135 French francs, down from 6.3715; and 1,341 Italian
lire, down from 1,356.9.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8655 West German marks, down from 1.8845; 1.6065
Swiss francs, down from 1.6180; 6.3155 French francs, down from
6.3825; 2.1030 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1240; 1,340.03 Italian
lire, down from 1,354.00; and 1.1809 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1838.
   Gold price movements were mixed.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents a troy ounce to close at
$369.64.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $368.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $369.20 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to
close at a bid $368.25 compared with $369.75 bid late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $370.50 an ounce from $367 Friday. Later Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $370.40 as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up from $467 on Friday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market, where silver
was trading at a late bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce, compared
with Friday's $5.14. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.269 an ounce from $5.137.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Fall Below 80 Cents A Pound, New 13-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices tumbled below 80 cents a pound to a
13{-year low on Monday as the market continued its month-long
search for support following the collapse of a price-stabilization
agreement.
   On other markets, precious metals and crude oil futures rallied;
grain and soybean futures fell sharply; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled 1.75 cents to 3.03 cents lower
on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for
delivery in September at 78.99 cents a pound, the lowest settlement
for a near-month contract since early 1976.
   The price plunge followed a weekend meeting of Latin American
foreign ministers in Colombia, where the coffee market was
discussed.
   No action was taken but Brazil and Colombia, respectively the
world's first- and second-largest coffee producers, issued a
statement after the meeting saying they supported higher prices.
   ``The market essentially shrugged its shoulders and said `So
what,''' said Arthur Stevenson, a New York-based coffee market
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``Obviously in the deregulated market, no producer wants to see
lower prices,'' he said.
   Coffee futures were trading near $1.14 a pound at the beginning
of July and have fallen steadily following the International Coffee
Organization's suspension of export quotas on July 3. The quotas
were designed to stabilize prices by limiting the amount of green
coffee that producer countries could sell to consumer countries
within the 74-nation organization.
   The quota suspension triggered a battle among coffee producers,
who have been aggressively cutting their prices in hopes of raising
their sales and their market share.
   But coffee roasters in consumer countries have been ``very
lackadaisical'' in their buying, ``because they anticipate the
abundance of coffee supplies to drive prices even lower,'' said
analyst Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Roaster demand is typically slack in the summer because coffee
consumption goes down in the warm months.
   Silver futures prices rebounded strongly on New York's Commodity
Exchange, regaining all the ground lost in Friday's sell-off.
   Peter Cardillo of Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York said a weaker
dollar, lower interest rates and concerns about Middle Eastern
stability helped support the market, which initially rose on
technical factors.
   Silver settled 12 cents to 13.2 cents higher with September at
$5.313 a troy ounce; gold was $3.30 to $3.50 higher with August at
$370.50 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
ending a six-day slide, amid jitters about the threat to Gulf Coast
drilling platforms from a tropical storm.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 38 cents
higher with September at $18.31 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent
to .49 cent higher with August at 48.67 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .53 cent to 1.15 cents higher with August at 53.48
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for near-month delivery
plunged to a 16{-month low and corn dropped to its lowest price in
14 months following a weekend of unexpectedly heavy rain in some of
the driest parts of the Midwest.
   Drier, warmer weather was expected for most of this week but
private forecasters predicted more showers in the Corn Belt by the
weekend.
   Soybeans settled 1{ cents to 24{ cents lower with August at
$6.24{ a bushel, the lowest near-month settlement since March 18,
1988; corn settled 2{ cents to 6{ cents lower with September at
$2.22{ a bushel, the lowest near-month corn settlement since June
1, 1988; wheat was 2 cents to 4} cents lower with September at
$3.84{ a bushel; oats were 5{ cents to 6{ cents lower with
September at $1.30{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished moderately higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, with feeder cattle leading the way on
speculation that lower corn prices will allow feedlot operators to
budget more for cattle purchases. Pork futures ended mostly lower
on weak pork demand and sluggish cash markets.
   Live cattle settled .03 cent to .33 cent higher with August at
72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .62 cent higher
with August at 83.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower
to .10 cent higher with August at 45.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .63 cent lower with August at 25.07 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>American Express Poll Shows Popularity of Travel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More adults in the United States, West Germany,
Japan and Britain traveled during the past year than visited a
library or attended a sporting event, play or concert, an American
Express survey shows.
   The poll, released Monday, shows that 69 percent of West German
adults had traveled in the past year, compared with 40 percent who
had attended a sporting event. Among U.S. adults, 63 percent had
traveled and 56 percent had been to a sports event. For Britain the
percentages were 59 percent and 40 percent, respectively; for
Japan, 57 percent and 22 percent.
   The four countries have the highest spending on travel. The
poll, conducted by The Gallup Organization for American Express
Travel Related Services Co. Inc., surveyed more than 6,500 adults
in March of this year.
   A traveler was defined as any person aged 18 or older who had
spent at least one night away from home in paid lodging during the
past 12 months, either domestically or abroad.
   Of the four nations, West Germans do the most international
travel and Japanese the least, according to the survey.
   It showed that most British and West German travelers who plan
to take a trip before the end of summer will travel abroad.
Japanese and U.S. vacationers, on the other hand, are more likely
to take domestic trips.
   For those Japanese who do travel overseas this summer, the
United States will be the leading destination, according to the
poll. It also will be a major foreign destination for West German
and British vacationers.
   For U.S. travelers, the most popular destinations were in North
America, the Caribbean and Hawaii, the poll showed.

<HEAD>LIN Deadline on McCaw Deal Passes without Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock price of LIN Broadcasting Corp.
slipped Monday after the company's deadline for a negotiated buyout
agreement with McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. passed without an
agreement.
   LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone, television
broadcasting and publishing concern, said its board would pursue
other options.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone operator, has an
outstanding hostile tender offer of $110 a share for the 90.2
percent of LIN's stock that it doesn't already own. LIN says the
offer is inadequate.
   In national over-the-counter trading Monday, LIN fell 62{ cents
a share to $109 while McCaw lost $1 a share to close at $37.
   The two companies disclosed in mid-July that they were talking
about a possible buyout at $127.50 a share. But McCaw, which is
based in Kirkland, Wash., said July 21 it had suspended those talks
pending further review.
   Subsequently, LIN set a 9 a.m. EDT Monday deadline for reaching
a definitive agreement under which McCaw would acquire LIN stock
for $127.50 a share, an offer that would value LIN's 53.9 million
shares at nearly $6.9 billion.
   ``LIN has given McCaw every reasonable opportunity to enter into
a merger agreement at the agreed price of $127.50,'' said LIN
Chairman Donald Pels.
   But McCaw called the deadline arbitrary and is continuing to
review the situation, McCaw spokesman Steve Bruce said Monday. In
the meantime, McCaw still feels its $110 a share offer, which
expires Aug. 11, is fair, he said.
   Pels said the $110 per share offer is inadequate and ``clearly
not in the best interests of LIN stockholders.''
   ``LIN's board of directors intends to pursue other options in
order to protect and enhance stockholder values,'' he said.
   Previously, LIN has proposed spinning off its seven television
stations as a company separate from its cellular telephone and
specialty publishing operations, which creates hardcover magazines
for placement in hotel rooms.
   The company has also previously indicated that it was in talks
with a third party that it declined to identify.

<HEAD>Kosher Food Maker Breaks Off Merger Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   B. Manischewitz Co., a leading maker of
kosher foods, said Monday it has terminated a merger agreement with
a Los Angeles investment firm, blaming what it called the firm's
unwillingness to complete the deal.
   Under the merger agreement, the 100-year-old company, best known
for the kosher wine that bears its name, was to be acquired by
Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. at $841 per share.
   ``It has become clear from the words and conduct of LTL that LTL
is not prepared or willing to close the merger,'' Manischewitz said
in a news release. The disagreement stems from a federal grand jury
investigation of alleged violations of the antitrust laws in the
kosher food industry.
   The investment firm claims Manischewitz refused to provide
information on the investigation, and that the refusal violated the
merger agreement. The company disagreed.
   Both sides, in news releases, expressed a willingness to
complete the deal.
   ``LTL regrets the company's decision not to provide the
necessary information,'' said Arthur E. Levine in a release issued
by his firm. ``In view of the decision, however, LTL intends to
enforce its rights under the merger agreement, including its right
to receive certain payments upon termination of the agreement.''
   A secretary at Levine, Tessler and Leichtman who would not give
her name said she could not confirm the amount sought in break-up
fees.
   Manischewitz officials said they were told of a $2.4 million fee.
   Both sides said they wish to avoid litigation over the issue and
have agreed to a two-day period in which neither party would file a
lawsuit against the other.
   Manischewitz has also received conditional offers from National
Foods Inc., of New York, and from Berisford Capital Corp., acting
with Santa Monica Partners, J. Morton Davis and other individual
investors.

<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. on Monday posted a $109.3 million
second-quarter loss, as strikebound subsidiary Eastern Airlines
suffered a $129.3 million loss that outweighed a profit by sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Houston-based Texas Air said the $109.3 million loss narrowed
from a loss of $255.9 million in the same quarter last year.
Second-quarter revenue dropped to $1.4 billion from $2.1 billion,
reflecting the virtual shutdown in Eastern's operations starting in
early March.
   For the first half of this year, Texas Air reported a loss of
$364.9 million on revenue of $3.3 billion, compared with a loss of
$380.1 million on revenue of $4.3 billion in the same period last
year.
   The news depressed the price of Texas Air stock, which dropped
12.5 cents a share to $16.25 in heavy trading on the American Stock
Exchange.
   Miami-based Eastern, which Texas Air bought in 1986, has been
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors since March
9, five days after Machinists union members, pilots and flight
attendants went on strike. Since then, efforts to sell the airline
have fallen through and Texas Air has proposed plans to resurrect
Eastern as a much smaller carrier.
   Texas Air said Eastern lost $129.3 million on revenue of $89.6
million during the quarter ended June 30, despite a $250 million
gain from the sale of its Northeast shuttle to developer Donald
Trump. The Eastern loss does not include a charge of $11.3 million
payable to preferred shareholders.
   In the same quarter last year, Eastern lost $89.8 million on
revenue of $1 billion before a $14.2 million charge for
preferred-stock dividends.
   Eastern also incurred costs of $17.2 million in the latest
quarter because of its reorganization, Texas Air said.
   In the first half of this year, Eastern lost $384.5 million on
revenue of $710.2 million, compared with a loss of $120.8 million
on revenue of $2 billion in the first six months of 1988. Both
losses do not include payments for preferred dividends.
   Separately Monday, Eastern said it has received permission from
federal bankruptcy court to pay dividends in kind on three of its
preferred stock issues. The dividends will be paid with new shares
of the same series of stock.
   ``We are steadily building our operations and, notably, our
customer base,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said. ``We are more
confident each day that Eastern will be well positioned to enter
the next decade as a revitalized, financially healthy major airline.
   ``We anticipate emerging from bankruptcy by the end of 1989,''
he said.
   Eastern filed a reorganization plan on July 21 which anticipates
paying off all debts, including refunding customers the price of
tickets that weren't used because of the strike. The airline said
it has exceeded its early goals for passenger traffic.
   Continental, Texas Air's other major subsidiary, posted a profit
of $32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion during the second
quarter. That compares with a net loss of $150.9 million in the
same quarter last year on revenue of $1.1 billion. Last year's
result included a $131 million accounting charge against income.
   In the first half, Continental, which itself emerged from
bankruptcy in 1986, had net income of $15.6 million on $2.5 billion
in revenue. That compared with last year's $231.5 million loss on
$2.2 billion in revenue.

<TEXT>
   J. Stewart Bryan III, publisher of Richmond
Newpapers Inc., has been elected chief operating officer of Media
General Inc.
   Bryan, the 51-year-old son of Media General chairman D. Tennant
Bryan, will continue as publisher of the Richmond Times-Dispatch
and The Richmond News Leader, the communications company said.
   Media General also has hired two new corporate officers and
promoted a third to the position of senior vice president.
   On Monday, Media General spokesman Robert W. Pendergast said the
announcement ``was made to fully recognize what Stewart's duties
entail within the corporation.''
   The selection, announced Thursday, is the first change in Media
General management since the July 2 death of James A. Linen IV,
executive vice president. Linen, 51, died from injuries sustained
in an accident in London while on vacation.
   Pendergast said some of the business unit heads who had reported
to Linen will report to Bryan.
   James S. Evans, Media General president, on Friday said the
change ``will strengthen significantly the management structure of
our organization.''
   In addition to publishing the Richmond papers, Media General
publishes the Tampa (Fla.) Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.)
Journal and operates TV stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston,
S.C., and WJKS in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Bryan began his newspaper career in the circulation department
of The Richmond News Leader. He was named publisher of the Richmond
papers in 1978.
   The Bryans, through a trust, control the B class of stock that
elects six of Media General's directors. Media General's A stock
elects three directors.
   In other Media General appointments, Marshall N. Morton has
joined the company as senior vice president and Basil Snider as
vice president. David L. Jordan has been promoted from vice
president to senior vice president.
   Morton, 44, who had been corporate vice president and controller
of West Point Pepperell since 1986, will be responsible for finance
and data processing.
   Snider, 62, former president of Media General's Garden State
Paper Co. subsidiary, will be in charge of newsprint holdings in
New Jersey, Mexico and Georgia.
   Jordan's new responsibilities will include staff activities that
affect acquisitions, planning and investor relations.

<TEXT>
   An agreement to sell a New Jersey chemical
plant has cleared the way for the $1.05 billion takeover of
Pennwalt Corp. by French oil giant Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine,
the companies announced Monday.
   The Federal Trade Commission said Monday it had accepted an
agreement that allows completion of the $132-a-share deal through
Stamford, Conn.-based AC Development Inc.
   The FTC said the agreement would become final after a 60-day
comment period. Elf Aquitaine would be able to accept and pay for
tendered shares of Pennwalt in the interim.
   Elf Aquitaine's offer, which had been scheduled to expire
Tuesday, was extended to 5 p.m. EDT Thursday. The companies said
about 4.7 million of Pennwalt's 7.9 million outstanding shares had
been tendered as of the close of business Friday.
   Pennwalt stock shot up on the announcement, closing up $4.62{ to
$131.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The FTC earlier had authorized its staff to seek a court order
blocking the deal because it ``could substantially reduce
competition in the production and sale'' of two fluorochemical
products, polyvinylidene fluoride and vinylidene fluoride.
   Pennwalt is the largest U.S. and worldwide seller of
polyvinylidene fluoride while Elf Aquitaine's chemical subsidiary,
Atochem, is third in both, the FTC said. Pennwalt and Elf Aquitaine
are the only suppliers of vinylidene fluoride in the United States,
the FTC said.
   Uses for polyvinylidene fluoride, sold by Pennwalt as Kynar
plastic resin, include coating electrical wires and lining pipes in
chemical plants. Vinylidene fluoride is a building block for
polyvinylidene fluoride.
   Pennwalt will sell its plant in Thorofare, N.J., but keep its
plant at Calvert City, Ky., where the bulk of its fluorochemical
manufacturing operations are based, the companies said.
   Sale of the Thorofare plant, which employs 66 people, will be
completed after the FTC agreement is finalized, Pennwalt
spokeswoman Sue Kinard Brown said. She said she could not comment
on whether a buyer had been found.
   ``Until we know who the buyer is, we really can't comment on
what will happen to the employees'' at the Thorofare plant, said
Anthony P. Fortino, Pennwalt's senior vice president for personnel.
``We'll make sure they're treated fairly.''
   The agreement requires Elf Aquitaine to sell the plant within 14
months. It also requires Elf Aquitaine for the next 10 years to
receive FTC approve before acquiring any interest in a company that
manufactures or sells either chemical in the United States.
   Pennwalt, a Philadelphia-based chemical company, agreed in March
to the buyout by Elf Aquitaine after spurning a hostile takeover
bid by Centaur Partners, a New York investment group.
   The deal would retain Pennwalt's name and keep its headquarters
in Philadelphia.
   Founded in 1850 as Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Co., Pennwalt
has sales of about $1 billion a year.
   Elf Aquitaine, a French government-controlled oil and chemical
concern, has more than $20 billion in annual sales with more than a
third related to chemicals.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Down 2 Percent in June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction nationwide
slipped 2 percent in June, its second monthly decline, led by a
drop in public works and utilities projects, according to a survey
released Monday.
   The survey, by the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information
Services Co., found that overall construction in June declined 2
percent to an annual rate of $249.7 million. That followed a 5
percent decline in May.
   Public works and utilities construction fell 5 percent in June
to an annual rate of $43.6 billion. June contracts for new
non-residential buildings, mainly commercial, industrial and
institutional structures, declined 3 percent to $89.9 billion.
   ``The overdeveloped commercial building market is the Achilles'
heel of the construction industry,'' said George A. Christie, the
group's vice president and chief economist.
   Despite recent weakening, total new construction in the second
quarter was slightly above that in the first quarter due to April's
high rate of contracting, F.W. Dodge said.
   ``We've been seeing more than the usual volatility in
contracting during the first half of 1989, but on balance, there's
been surprisingly little slowdown from the strong 1987-88 pace of
building,'' Christie said. ``The construction sector's prospects
for this year's second half are good.''

   Abbott Laboratories on Monday announced the
settlement of all litigation involving an Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
subsidiary that had accused the North Chicago pharmaceutical
company of patent infringement.
   The settlement ends four separate legal actions pending in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles. Terms of the settlement with the
Lilly subsidiary, Hybritech Inc. of San Diego, were not disclosed.
   One of the cases involved Hybritech's 1986 claim that pregnancy
tests and other diagnostic tests marketed by Abbott unlawfully used
technology developed by Hybritech.
   The other matters settled by the agreement are an antitrust case
against Abbott, which was on appeal following a jury verdict in
Abbott's favor; an Abbott lawsuit charging Hybritech with
misappropriating marketing and research secrets through former
Abbott workers now employed by Hybritech; and a Hybritech lawsuit
alleging Abbott infringed on a patent covering a method and
apparatus for analyzing immune systems.
   Abbott is a diversified health care company and a leader in
diagnostic equipment. Hybritech, which manufactures and sells
diagnostic equipment, was acquired by Indianpolis-based Lilly in
1984.

   A projected slowing in business activity will
result in a decline of 3 percent in steel service center shipping
this year, the Steel Service Center Institute said Monday.
   The institute is a trade association representing 85 percent of
the steel service center industry. Steel service centers purchase
and distribute one out of every three tons of carbon industrial
steel products and nearly half of all stainless steel produced in
the United States.
   A 3 percent decline would bring total U.S. shipments for the $24
billion steel service center industry down to 22.8 million tons
shipped this year, compared with 23.5 million tons in 1988. The
industry has had six straight record shipping years.
   ``The service center industry attained record shipping levels in
the first half of 1989, as shipments climbed a slight 0.4 percent
ahead of last year's record pace,'' said Andrew G. Sharkey,
institute president.
   ``We anticipate that the third and fourth quarters will be soft,
although not recessionary. Most major steel-consuming markets are
drifting down to lower, but sustainable, levels of activity.''

<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp.'s second-quarter profit rose 88
percent, due largely to real estate sales, higher crude oil prices
and improved oil shale operations, the oil company said Monday.
   Net earnings were $120 million, or $1.02 per share, on revenue
of $3.08 billion. In the second quarter of 1988, Unocal earned $64
million, or 55 cents per share, on revenue of $2.57 billion.
   The higher real estate earnings were due to $27 million in
after-tax gains from the sale of properties in Torrance, Calif.,
and San Diego County, said Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman
and president.
   He said that a gain from the settlement of some pension
obligations also increased earnings.
   Partially offsetting the gains were higher foreign taxes and
increased domestic production expenses, Stegemeier said.
   For the first six months, Unocal earned $207 million, or $1.77
per share, compared with six-month 1988 earnings of $242 million,
or $2.08 per share. Last year's results included a $134 million net
gain from the combined effects of a change in accounting principle
for income taxes, which resulted in a $456 million gain, offset by
$322 million in writedowns of some assets.
   Revenue for the first six months of this year totaled $5.7
billion, up from a restated $4.9 billion in the same period of 1988.

<HEAD>Traders Reject Federal Plea Bargain Deal, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodities traders and brokers from the Chicago
Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have turned down
government plea bargain offers, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The 40 traders from the two exchanges are expected to be
indicted this week on charges of racketeering or mail or wire
fraud, and could face sentences of 30 to 38 months in prison if
convicted, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
   The government team, headed by Paul Coffey, the Washington-based
deputy chief of the Justice Department's organized crime and
racketeering sections, also is threatening traders with loss of
their seats on the exchanges and confiscation of their homes, cars
and other possessions, the Sun-Times said.
   The government team proposed a deal to defense lawyers during
weekend meetings that the traders plead guilty to alleged illegal
trades and cooperate with prosecutors, the newspaper reported.
   But the newspaper said lawyers for the traders and brokers
rejected the government offer. While no specific promises were
made, the implication was that the defendants would get better
treatment if they cooperated, the newspaper said.
   Some defense attorneys said their clients would make restitution
for the alleged illegal trades, but the offers were turned down,
the newspaper reported. The report said other lawyers offered to
have their clients plead guilty to misdemeanors, but the government
insisted on felony charges.
   A felony conviction could bar a trader from returning to the
floor.
   A 2{-year investigation in the case involved undercover federal
agents placed in the Merc and CBOT. Armed with concealed
microphones, the agents focused on ``the swaggering types,'' and
people who displayed extravagant lifestyles, an unidentified source
told the newspaper.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Grady ruled Friday that tapes made
by agents could be used in the prosecution. The recordings took
place in the exchanges, bars, restaurants and even restrooms,
sources told the newspaper.

<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. failed to tell Home Shopping
Network its telephone system couldn't handle an ever-growing number
of calls, costing the video retailer millions of dollars, an HSN
attorney told a jury Monday.
   Attorney Chester Kamin contended in his final arguments that GTE
knew in 1986 that the situation had become so bad that 2,500 calls
every five minutes were not making it into HSN's headquarters here.
   In a $1.5 billion fraud suit filed in Pinellas Circuit Court,
HSN claims it lost millions of calls and about $500 million in
potential sales because the the GTE equipment couldn't handle the
call volume in 1986 and early 1987.
   GTE Florida and its parent company, GTE Corp. of Stamford,
Conn., in turn, filed a slander suit against HSN, claiming the
losses were actually due to the electronic retailer's unbridled
growth and customer dissatisfaction.
   The trial, which has lasted six weeks, was to resume Tuesday
morning with final arguments from the attorney for GTE.
   Since presiding Judge Howard Rives has already instructed the
jury on laws pertaining to the case, it could go into deliberation
as soon as Tuesday afternoon.
   In a summation that lasted more than three hours, Kamin said GTE
is trying to muddle the case with its counterclaim. He described
GTE as a ``giant octupus'' that ``squirts ink so you can't see it.
   ``What you see in this courtroom is ink, ink, ink, to keep you
from seeing what's going on,'' Kamin said.
   Kamin accused GTE of greed in declining to give HSN early notice
of problems so steps could be taken to correct the situation. He
said GTE only ``wanted to keep the money made by the (telephone)
network.''
   Kamin said the crux of the problem was that GTE, which knew
early on of HSN's plans to expand, didn't put in enough lines to
handle HSN's calls. ``We lost calls and that's all there is to it.''
   In one year, HSN's cable audience soared from 9 million to 46.5
million.

<HEAD>Occidental Resumes North Sea Pumping a Year After Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Monday that
it was again pumping North Sea oil, a year after 167 men died when
its Piper Alpha platform exploded off Scotland and half a year
after it had hoped to resume production.
   Occidental oil from the Alpha, Claymore and Scapa fields in the
British sector of the North Sea had flowed through the huge Alpha
platform, which exploded in flames on July 6, 1988, and was
destroyed.
   The big oil company said last August that it hoped to resume
North Sea production by the end of the year. But it was not until
Saturday that it began pumping oil from the Scapa field through the
Claymore platform at about 17,000 barrels per day, according to the
announcement Monday.
   Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said production is expected to
reach about 100,000 barrels per day later this year.
   The company said it had installed underwater emergency shutdown
valves on all platforms leading to and from the Claymore platform
and had taken other safety measures in accordance with industry
guidelines issued by the United Kingdom Department of Energy.
   Occidental has offered $187 million in compensation to the
families of the victims, but negotiations continue with their
attorneys.
   Occidental's second-quarter earnings, announced last week, fell
to $26 million from $78 million in 1988, due in large part to
exploration and production losses from the North Sea disaster.

<HEAD>Prudhoe Oil Production Decline To Be Felt This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declining production at Prudhoe Bay
will mean a decrease of almost 10 percent in the next two years in
oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline, state and industry
officials say.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of the North Slope
oil producers, said Monday that some of the production slippage of
100,000 barrels a day this year is attributable to the spill by the
Exxon Valdez.
   ``The oil spill accounted for about 12 million barrels of lost
opportunity, reducing the average by 32,000 barrels a day,'' said
Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan. ``But 60,000 barrels was due to
field production decline and producer maintenance.''
   The average daily flow through the pipeline is expected to drop
another 75,000 barrels next year.
   Prudhoe Bay accounts for three-quarters of the production on the
North Slope, which provides about one-fourth of the nation's
domestic oil supply.
   Brennan said the average daily flow in the pipeline is expected
to drop from 2 million barrels to 1.9 million this year and to 1.83
million in 1990.
   The Prudhoe Bay field, the largest in the United States, began
producing in 1977.
   Chuck Logsdon, the state's chief petroleum economist, said that
more than half of the estimated 10 billion barrels in the reservoir
have been drained. He said production is expected to drop 12
percent to 15 percent a year.
   Logsdon said none of the other producing fields on the North
Slope is large enough to compensate for the Prudhoe Bay falloff.
   The production decline will cost the state of Alaska $175
million in lost taxes and royalties over the next two years,
Logsdon says. The state gets about 85 percent of its revenue from
oil.
