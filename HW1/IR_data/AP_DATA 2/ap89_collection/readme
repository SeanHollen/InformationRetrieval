<HEAD>Yacht That Took Gary Hart On Famous Cruise Suffered From Fame</HEAD>

   Monkey Business, the yacht that helped sink Gary
Hart's presidential aspirations in 1988, is for sale, and its
captain says notoriety from Hart's trip to Bimini with Donna Rice
hurt business.
   The charter boat, which is docked at Turberry Marina in Miami,
is on sale for $1.5 million, Capt. Butch Vogelsang said in a report
published Sunday in The Denver Post.
   The 83-foot yacht briefly became a household name in 1987, when
Miami model Donna Rice was photographed sitting on Democratic
presidential candidate Hart's lap during a cruise to Bimini.
   The photograph surfaced after published reports that Hart and
Rice spent a night together at the candidate's Washington, D.C.,
townhouse. The revelations forced Hart to withdraw from the
presidential race.
   Vogelsang said he remembers the trip to Bimini with Hart and
Rice.
   ``I'll tell you what happened. Nothing,'' he said. ``Hart didn't
do anything with the girls. A captain knows what goes on on the
ship. I can tell you this. The beds weren't touching. If anything,
Hart acted so naive. He just kind of stood around. He wasn't a
boatsman.''
   But the stories about that famous cruise nearly ruined the
Monkey Business, Vogelsang said.
   ``We were dead after the publicity,'' he said. ``We mostly
charter out for a week at a time, and anybody who spends $25,000
doesn't want people staring and saying, `Oh, there goes the Monkey
Business. Where's Gary?' They want privacy.''
   Since then, business has steadily improved, he said. ``We're
doing about 40 charters a year now.''

Each document contains the DOC and DOCNO fields.  Other fields include:
FILEID, NOTE, UNK, FIRST, SECOND, HEAD, DATELINE, TEXT and BYLINE.  
The FIRST, SECOND, and HEAD fields may contain headline-type information, or may
contain notes to the editor, notices of upcoming stories, etc.  These
fields also contain lots of "noisy" characters.  The FILEID field contains
a timestamp for the story, but may not be unique.  The DATELINE field contains
the source location of the story.  A BYLINE field containing information
about the writer may also be present.  Often fields may be missing or may 
contain only "noise".  Additionally the TEXT fields may be blank for
stories that are notices of upcoming events, etc.  The AP data is very noisy,
containing fragment sentences, spliced sentences, pseudo-duplicate stories,
and other such items as might be expected when pulling material off newswires.
Much of these has been cleaned up by the AT & T programs, but much remains.

The "<" and ">" signs have been changed "less than" and "greater than".  The
files also contain the following SGML entities:  

		amp    (for the "&" sign); 
		lsqb   (for the "[" sign); 
		rsqb   (for the "]" sign); 
		plus   (for the "+" sign);
		equals (for the "=" sign).
