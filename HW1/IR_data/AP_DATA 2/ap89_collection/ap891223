<HEAD>Bridge Drawspan Activates Accidentally, Killing One</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A drawspan on the world's longest floating bridge
was raised accidentally during a test Friday, sending rush-hour
traffic into a rising wall of steel that killed one woman and
injured at least five other people.
   State officials were at a loss to explain what went wrong in the
test, which has been conducted every Friday morning for 18 years
without incident, said Leslie Salisbury, a Department of
Transportation spokeswoman.
   She said operator error had virtually been ruled out in the 8:50
a.m. accident, which blocked traffic in both directions on the
Evergreen Point Bridge. The span reopened at 2:45 p.m.
   The 25-year-old bridge, a series of concrete pontoons across
Lake Washington, opens by raising two, 100-foot-long steel grids
about 7 feet and moving an adjacent pontoon beneath them.
   The weekly test checks drawbridge circuitry and does not involve
actually moving the span.
   Salisbury said the bridge-opening sequence requires 18 distinct
steps. ``When the operator got to the 10th step, for some reason
one part of the drawspan opened up,'' she said.
   Transportation Department crews ran through the procedure three
times Friday afternoon, ``and every time we got to that step the
drawspan opened,'' Salisbury said.
   The step should not have involved the drawspan mechanism at all,
she said. Ron Anderson, department district administrator,
``likened it to turning on your windshield wipers and having the
radio come on instead,'' Salisbury said.
   The bridge drawspan lifted about 4{ feet, creating a wall that
three vehicles drove into head-on. Several cars were left perched
on the elevated section of the bridge, some with blown tires and
mangled metal from hitting the rising span. No cars went into the
water.
   Mark Bauty, a motorist, told radio station KIRO that his car
bounced over the lip of the drawspan just as it started to open and
he could hear tires screeching and metal crunching behind him.
   ``The bridge was probably 6 inches high I guess when I hit it
and the car made it over the front end, kept right on going and
flew off the back end when the bridge was probably about a
foot-and-a-half to two feet high,'' he said.
   ``When I realized what happened and I looked in the rear view
mirror I could see some cars who had headed into what appeared to
be solid steel.''
   There was no warning the bridge was opening, said DOT
spokeswoman Heidi Keller. Normally, gates are lowered and lights
flash to stop traffic.
   The identity of the 44-year-old Seattle woman killed in the
accident was not released. John Lombardini, county Medical Examiner
investigator, said an autopsy would be conducted to determine the
cause of death.
   Three people were hospitalized in serious but stable condition
with multiple injuries, and two other people were treated and
discharged.
   Salisbury said the motors for the bridge span were disengaged
and the control panel locked.
   State inspectors will check the bridge further on Tuesday for
possible damage and expect to close the bridge briefly in January
for a more detailed look.
   She said the department also has recommended an independent
consultant do an investigation.
   Opening the drawspan, which provides a 200-foot opening, is
necessary only 30 to 40 times a year because most vessels can pass
under elevated portions of the bridge at each end, officials said.
   Evergreen Point Bridge, formally known as the Albert D.
Rosellini Bridge, is more than two miles long, and more than 7,000
feet of it is on pontoons.

   A cave explorer pinned 60 feet beneath the surface
by a 1,000-pound boulder was rescued Friday night by emergency
crews, authorities said.
   The man, whose legs were trapped by the huge rock, was pinned
for more than two hours in freezing temperatures. His name, age and
condition were not immediately known.
   Lt. George Meek of the Travis County Sheriff's Department said
deputies and Austin firefighters pulled the explorer out of the
cave in a wilderness area southwest of Austin at about 10 p.m.
   Meek said the man was part of a group of spelunkers, or cave
explorers, which apparently lacked permission to be on the
property. ``From what we understand, the owner of the property is
not a happy camper'' Meek said.
   Sheriff's spokesman Curtis Weeks said the man was the last one
trying to leave the cave when the boulder fell on his legs,
trapping him about 2{ hours.
   While about 50 rescue workers labored to free the man,
temperatures Friday night plunged into the single digits with
sub-zero wind chills.
   Meek said the sheriff's office was notified of the accident
about 7:30 p.m. Meek said he unsure just how the boulder was moved
to free the explorer.
   Meek said the cave is in a protected area along Barton Creek on
a rancher's private land.

<HEAD>US May Aid New Leaders in Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will consider aid to
the new government taking shape in Romania once it dismantles the
system inherited from ousted President Nicolae Ceaucescu and
institutes reforms, officials say.
   The White House and the State Department hailed the demise of
Ceaucescu's hard-line government Friday and expressed hope for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher credited the
``courageous and persistent action by the Romanian people'' who
prevailed ``in the face of great odds and despite bloody
repression.''
   Ceausescu's ouster seemed to foreshadow an improvement in
U.S.-Romanian relations, which have been under severe strain,
particularly since last weekend when anti-government uprisings
began.
   Ceaucescu's repressive policies contributed to Romania's loss of
U.S. trade privileges last year. The administration was about to
impose additional sanctions Friday but reversed itself after
Ceaucescu was forced out.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. aid would be
considered ``once reforms are made'' by Romania's new authorities.
   Boucher gave a cautious welcome to the designation of a former
diplomat, Corneliu Manescu, to form an interim government.
   He said Manescu's career has been distinguished and he noted the
one-time foreign minister has been a leading advocate of political
reform in Romania.
   Fitzwater said the United States is ready for better relations
with the new government if it ``moves along a path of general
democratic reform. The United States pledges its strong support and
assistance.
   ``We hope that Romania will soon join the other countries in
Central and Eastern Europe which have ushered in a new era of
cooperation between East and West,'' the spokesman said.
   Boucher said the State Department formed a task force Thursday
night to monitor events in Romania and ordered the partial
evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest when the situation
appeared to be worsening.
   With the dramatic turn of events Friday morning, the evacuation
order was rescinded but embassy dependents who wished to depart the
country were allowed to do so. About 20 chose to leave Friday,
Boucher said.

<HEAD>Is There A Santa Claus? Yes, Virginia ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The editorial ``Is There a Santa Claus?'' first appeared in The
New York Sun, Sept. 21, 1897. It was written by Francis Pharcellus
Church, an assistant to the editor of The Sun.
   ``We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the
   communication below, expressing at the same time our great
gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the
friends of The Sun:
   `Dear Editor:
   I am 8 years old.
   Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.
   Papa says `If you see it in The Sun it's so.'
   Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?
   Virginia O'Hanlon
   115 West 95th Street'
   Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected
by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except
they see. They think that nothing can be which is not
comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether
they be men's or children's are little. In this great universe of
ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared
with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence
capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
   Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as
love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how
dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be
as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no
childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this
existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight.
The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be
extinguished.
   Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in
fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the
Chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they
did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody
sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that neither children
nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of
course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable
in the world.
   You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the
strongest man, not even the united strength of all the strongest
men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry,
love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the
supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in
all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
   No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives, and he lives forever. A
thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand
years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of
childhood.''

<HEAD>Jury Recommends 16 Years for Man Convicted in Church Bus Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man who caused the deaths of 27
people on a church bus in the nation's worst drunken-driving
accident was taken to jail after a jury recommended a 16-year
prison sentence.
   But the relatives of some of his victims said the jury, which
rejected murder charges to find him guilty of manslaughter, was too
lenient. They noted Larry Mahoney still has a family to celebrate
Christmas with.
   ``We're going to spend it in a cemetery with a headstone,'' Bill
Nichols, said after a sentencing hearing Friday, clasping hands
with his wife, Madeline.
   The couple's only child, 17-year-old William Joseph Nichols Jr.,
was among the 24 youths and three adults killed by smoke inhalation
and flames in a fire that swept through a former school bus after
Mahoney's pickup struck it on Interstate 71, five miles south of
Carrollton. Mahoney was drunk and driving on the wrong side of the
highway when the crash occurred May 14, 1988.
   Mahoney, 36, who had been free on bond prior to his conviction,
was led in handcuffs out of the Carroll County Courthouse Friday
and taken to the local jail after Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite
discontinued his bail.
   Mahoney was convicted on Thursday of 27 counts each of
second-degree manslaughter and first-degree wanton endangerment, 12
of first-degree assault, 14 of second-degree wanton endangerment
and one of drunken driving.
   The jury on Friday recommended sentences totaling 611 years, but
opted to have them run concurrently. That effectively gave Mahoney
16 years of a possible 20-year sentence for assault, the most
serious offense. He would be eligible for parole consideration in
eight years under Kentucky law.
   Satterwhite is to sentence Mahoney February 23. The judge can
give Mahoney a lighter sentence, but cannot exceed the jury's
recommendation.
   ``If you ask me if I'm disappointed, yeah, I'm disappointed,''
said Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky, who prosecuted
Mahoney on 27 murder counts. ``I thought all of the carnage ... was
worth more than eight years in prison.''
   The jury's recommendation shocked Karen Morgan, president of
Students Against Drunk Driving at Radcliff's North Hardin High
School.
   ``It's going to be hard going back to my school and ... telling
them that this man only got a minimum of eight years,'' said Miss
Morgan, whose 13-year-old brother, Phillip, was among those killed.
``What kind of example do you set for them?''
   Defense attorneys William Summers and Russell Baldani said they
were pleased with the verdicts and sentencing recommendation, but
will appeal the convictions.
   ``What is (Mahoney's) life worth?'' Summers said. ``Will it
bring somebody back? Will it make them feel better?''
   At his sentencing hearing, Mahoney told the jury he intended to
lecture schoolchildren on the evils of drinking and driving.

   American troops who stormed Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's quarters found photographs of Adolf Hitler
and Mother Teresa, a voodoo witches' brewery and a packet of
cocaine wrapped in a banana leaf, U.S. officers say.
   The ousted dictator's homes and offices also contained items
ranging from Christmas trees to high-powered arms as well as a
collection of pornography, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the
U.S. Southern Command, and other officers told reporters Friday.
   A bucket in an upstairs bathroom of one house was filled with a
rusty-red looking substance identified as blood. An officer said he
did not know what kind of creature the blood came from or what it
was used for.
   Officers said soldiers who burst into the house on the first day
of the U.S. intervention here Tuesday narrowly missed capturing
four voodoo witches from Brazil.
   The so-called ``witch house,'' a fortified structure specially
built for Noriega, contained such voodoo artifacts as dead fish
adorned with yellow ribbons, two bowls of popcorn cluttered with
dead flowers, and broken statues.
   ``This was the brewery for the witches, if you will,'' said Col.
Mike Snell, the officer in charge of the area.
   Thurman said the ``voodoo practitioners ... practiced rituals
for Noriega's protection.''
   The banana leaf with the cocaine inside it was found in a
freezer. Snell said it was part of 50 pounds of the drug found in
Noriega's quarters.
   The general's office in Panama's military barracks at Fort
Amador had two display cases containing plastic frogs, electronic
toys such as a video wristwatch and framed pictures of Hitler,
Mother Teresa and Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi. His downtown
office was adorned with Christmas trees, more electronics and more
frogs.
   Pornography was found at both offices, Snell said.
   Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Torregrossa said the Fort Amador office
also contained expensive prints and ``a lot of expensive weapons,
mostly automatic. He had German Lugers, Israeli Uzis, all sorts of
real sophisticated stuff.''
   Thurman told reporters, ``He was clearly dedicated to outfitting
a substantial force, outfitting dignity battalions, which in the
long run would have given the U.S. a tremendous challenge in this
area.''
   U.S. intelligence officials scoured the offices in the hope of
finding records that would help trace Noriega's assets. In
Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said
financial documents seized by the troops in Noriega's offices might
help authorities trace assets and bank holdings stashed in foreign
countries.
   Snell said Noriega had been spotted at the house during the last
several months.
   He said the house was searched for booby traps after pipe bombs
were found in it.
   Lt. Curtis Vinyard said the house had apparently been occupied
until shortly before it was stormed by U.S. troops.
   ``There was still a candle burning,'' he said.
   The house, on the seacoast near here and close to several U.S.
military bases, was stormed by U.S. soldiers on Tuesday, about six
hours after the U.S. invasion began.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. invasion of Panama has inflamed
Latin American sensitivity about national self-determination and
revived the old image of a militaristic, meddling Uncle Sam.
   From the Rio Grande to Cape Horn, and including the Caribbean,
government officials, newspapers and other opinion-makers have
roundly condemned the military action as improper and immoral.
   The force and unanimity of the reaction reflects just how
passionately Latin Americans embrace the principle of
non-intervention, coupled with a persistent sense of vulnerability
toward the superpower to the north. It overshadows universal
revulsion toward Noriega, who was seen as a throwback to the
thuggish dictators of the 1950s.
   ``Given the simplistic and emotional way the United States is
used to dealing with sensitive issues _ that of drug trafficking,
for instance _ what is there to guarantee that in the future the
U.S. won't decide that this problem has become unmanageable in
Colombia?'' asked respected columnist Enrique Santos in the
independent Bogota daily El Tiempo.
   ``One excess could lead to another,'' he warned.
   El Tiempo said in an editorial that the U.S. action in Panama
``wounds the sensibility of a continent with a collective memory of
other interventions.''
   On a half-dozen occasions during the 1900s, the United States
has dispatched troops to Latin American or Caribbean nations to
effect and enforce political change. The most recent cases were
Grenada in 1983 and the Dominican Republic in 1967.
   Joaquin Balaguer, the Dominican Republic's president, said the
new U.S. action, ``in spite of the expressed motives which deserve
all our respect and sympathy, is condemned by the Dominician
government and people.''
   The government of Barbados, which backed the invasion of
Grenada, criticized the new action as did the Barbados-based daily
The Nation, one of the Caribbean's largest newspapers.
   ``No excuse this time, Mr. Bush,'' The Nation said in an
editorial headline. It said it supported the Grenada investion
because it was carried out with regional support. ``We did not see
the Americans then in the role of an aggressive superpower,
trampling on weak opponents and acting on its own. We do in this
case.''
   Across the region news of the fighting in Panama has dominated
front pages and television broadcasts. Some of the coverage has
been laced by stinging editorial comment.
   In Rio de Janeiro, the independent daily Jornal do Brasil ran an
editorial cartoon depicting President Bush as a caveman with a bone
in his hair, a club and a U.S. flag worn bearskin-style. In a
front-page analysis the newspaper said: ``The big stick to which
President George Bush resorted in imposing his order on Panama
could reveal its most twisted effect: the boomerang.''
   On the other hand, not a single Latin American leader defended
Noriega's harsh reign.
   Mario Vargas Llosa, a novelist and conservative presidential
candidate widely expected to win election in Peru, described
Noriega as ``a disgrace and embarrassment to all the people of
Latin America.'' He said the principle of non-intervention could
not be invoked to justify Noriega's dictatorship, but nonetheless
expressed regret over the invasion and called for the withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
   The conservative Bogota daily El Siglo said the U.S. invasion
had transformed Noriega ``from a victimizer into a victim.''
   In the most forceful response of a Latin American leader, Peru's
leftist president, Alan Garcia, recalled his country's ambassador
to the United States and proposed postponing a Feb. 15 drug summit
in Cartagena, Colombia, with Bush, Garcia, President Virgilio Barco
of Colombia and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.
   ``I cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation,'' Garcia
said. ``Holding a dialogue with a pistol on the table cannot be
permitted.''
   Peru's government also suspended joint operations with U.S. drug
agents in the country's coca-growing Huallaga Valley.
   The Barco government in Colombia said it would not hurry to
recognize the new Panamanian presidency of Guillermo Endara, whose
swearing-in at a U.S. military base as the invasion got under way
was seen by many Latin Americans as embarassingly staged.
   Fernando Color de Mello, the president-elect of Brazil, Latin
America's largest country, called the invasion ``a regrettable
episode'' that runs contrary to global currents in favor of
self-determination and political liberalization, ``especially in
Eastern Europe.''
   The seven leading Latin American democracies of Peru, Brazil,
Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Uruguay and Argentina have been
adamant in pressing the principle of non-intervention as a solution
to Central America's political conflicts. In response to the U.S.
invasion, the countries pushed a resolution in the Organization of
American States strongly condemning it.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico said the invasion
``is contrary to the principles that regulate international
relations.''
   Mexico's political parties, in their first unanimous action in
many years, also blasted the invasion.

   Country music star Clint Black said he got the
audience at Carnegie Hall in New York to loosen up at a recent
concert, but there was one small snag.
   the crowd at the stately concert hall seemed to enjoy his
singing and made it seem ``like Austin on a Saturday night,'' he
said.
   One man even left a note on the window of his private bus that
was parked on the street just outside Carnegie Hall. It read: ``Yo,
Clint, loved the show.''
   One problem though: The man was a city policeman, and he also
left behind a ticket for illegal parking, Black told The Dallas
Morning News in an interview published Friday.
   Black is the first country male artist in 15 years to have his
debut single reach the No. 1 spot. His third single, ``Nobody's
Home,'' was released in November.

   Chemists B. Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann, who concocted a controversial cold fusion experiment
in a kitchen, are at it again.
   This time, the results won't be questioned. Neither will they be
the subject of a new race to harness the power of the sun and stars.
   Pons and Fleischmann, who earlier this year rocked the
scientific community with claims they'd achieved a sustained fusion
reaction in a flask, annually turn their attention from laboratory
research to the kitchen.
   The menu at their holiday open house this year consisted of
nearly 60 different foods and beverages.
   The offerings included tortellini in sausage pesto; antipasto
misto; pate with green peppercorns and truffles; and avocado-lemon
mousse.
   Fleischmann said he looks ``askance at a scientist who doesn't
like to cook. Chemists, on the whole, take up cooking as a hobby.
Some study history or music, but I'd say cooking is the first
choice.''

   The daughter of Mayor Tom Bradley has been
charged with drunken driving and faces up to a year in jail if
convicted, an official said.
   Phyllis Bradley, 44, was charged Thursday with driving under the
influence and driving with a blood alcohol content of more than .10
percent following her arrest on Dec. 15, said Mike Qualls, a
spokesman for the city attorney's office.
   Bradley has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and has been
convicted of drunken driving before. Because of her prior
conviction, she faces a maximum sentence of one year in county
jail, a fine of $1,000 and five years probation, Qualls said. The
minimum term is 48 hours in jail, he said.
   Bradley was stopped by police in Los Angeles after making an
illegal U-turn.
   In a statement after her arrest, Ms. Bradley acknowledeged
having been arrested for such offenses in the past and didn't
contest the police allegation.
   The mayor has declined to comment on his daughter's arrest.
   She is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 5, Qualls said.

   Chinese pingpong star Jiao Zhimin
married a South Korean national pingpong player in an opulent
traditional Korean wedding ceremony at Olympic Park.
   Zhimin, 25, of China wed Ahn Jae-hyung, 24, on Friday,
celebrating the end of a five-year courtship started after the two
met at an international pingpong tournament in Pakistan in 1984.
They had married in a civil ceremony in Stockholm last month.
   The wedding procession included musicians playing flutes. The
bride was carried on attendants' shoulders in a litter and the
groom led the procession on a pony.
   Jiao covered her face from the groom during the ceremony, as is
tradition, and bowed many times toward her new husband. On the
wedding table beside candles and fruit, a live rooster and hen
clucked quietly, wrapped in cloth as a symbol of matrimonial
harmony.
   The two have said their love bloomed despite language
difficulties, bureaucratic problems and the lack of diplomatic
relations between their two nations. They plan to live in Seoul.
   Ahn was the bronze medalist in the men's doubles in the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul and Jiao won the silver in women's doubles
and a bronze medal in singles.

<HEAD>Eastern Airline Reduces Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines announced its first cut in
scheduled daily flights since it began its reorganization last
March at the outset of a long strike, and said it might lay off
some employees.
   The carrier, which earlier in the week sold its Latin American
routes to American Airlines, announced Friday it was cutting daily
flights from 830 to 802 effective Jan. 31.
   Eliminated flights include some nonstop service from Miami to
Boston, Philadelphia, Orlando, Tampa, and runs to several Caribbean
cities. More flight cutbacks are to follow once the deal with
American has been completed.
   Eastern told employees this week that ``some furloughs may be
necessary as we reduce operations.''
   But the airline doesn't anticipate ayoffs of pilots, flight
attendants or mechanics, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Friday.
   Eastern, which had more than 30,000 employees and 1,040 daily
flights before the strike began March 4, now employs about 20,000
workers, most of them non-union.
   The flight reduction was prompted by economic priorities, Matell
said.
   ``We're trying to develop the best possible schedule that opens
the most potential for profitability,'' he said.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors five days after its three unions struck last March. In
April, the carrier announced plans to rebuild to about two-thirds
its pre-strike size.
   In August, negotiations over the sale of Eastern's Central and
South American routes to American stalled, and Eastern officials
said they would keep those routes and build back to 90 percent of
their airline's pre-strike size.
   But Eastern creditors reportedly were displeased over projected
cash shortfalls, prompting the sale this week of the Latin American
service and other assets by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Approval of the sale to American by the U.S. Department of
Transportation and the U.S. bankruptcy court is expected to take up
to six months, and Eastern will continue to fly the routes until
approval has been granted.
   Officials of the Machinists union, the only union still on
strike, said Eastern's planes are flying at less than half capacity
in spite of the airline's sharp discounting to boost business.
   Eastern flights averaged about 50 percent occupancy during the
first half of December, Matell said.

   At the sledgehammer's final blow, a
cheer went up from the crowd outside a house belonging to one of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's closest associates.
   People poured into the house at a dead run, exultant. They
poured out again with bottles of French champagne, silver coffee
pots and sequined sombreros.
   But this was no ordinary looting mission. It was a middle-class
crowd for the most part, and they were venting pent-up loathing for
the general and all he stood for.
   ``Democracy has arrived,'' one young man said. ``We don't want
these military guys running things. They are thieves.''
   Someone emptied a case of campaign-style buttons bearing the
slogan: ``Onward with Noriega!'' and began gleefully stomping on
them, grinding them flat with a little dance as onlookers applauded.
   The house belonged to Carlos A. Wittgreen, a businessman
believed to be a key player in the maze of front companies hiding
Noriega's money-laundering and cocaine-smuggling schemes.
   ``He's Noriega's right hand,'' one man said as people opened box
after box of handcuffs in amazement.
   The house was sacked after a U.S. armored vehicle bombarded the
place.
   Troops barricaded the street at mid-afternoon Friday and opened
fire. They pelted it with tear gas and demanded Wittgreen's
surrender over a bullhorn.
   When no one emerged, they left and the people began running
toward the house, cheering.
   Teresa Bay Guardia sat on the grass nearby, sorting through the
files and boxes of documents her teen-agers were hauling out as
fast as they could. Their eyes streamed from the biting sting of
the tear gas trapped inside, but they were grinning like they'd
just won the lottery.
   ``I'm gathering evidence,'' she said as sofas, office chairs,
potted plants and paintings went by at a dizzying clip. ``I have a
friend in the opposition I'm giving this to.''
   There was a pile of letterhead stationery. Five different
companies. Five different addresses. One telephone number.
   Someone else found a handwritten ledger in a spiral notebook.
Page after page of coded transactions, many with Noriega's general
staff.
   Guardia, a U.S. citizen raised in Panama, looked at the pile of
documents as though Christmas had come a few days early to Panama.
   ``I've walked many a mile, been in many a demonstration against
Noriega,'' she said. ``This is the first time I haven't been afraid
to give my name.''
   She said she couldn't understand the international criticism of
the U.S. invasion. ``Ask the Panamanians. We're the one's who have
been living the situation,'' she said.
   Even with the lawlessness and looting that has broken out, she
said, ``We're delighted.''

   People took up arms and formed
vigilante squads to combat looting and thousands jammed churches,
stadiums and schools to flee fighting that has ravaged the capital.
Food and medicine were in short supply.
   As the U.S. military occupation entered its fourth day today,
weary and frightened residents stayed behind locked doors to avoid
street battles between fighters loyal to ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and American forces.
   Much of this city of 1 million people was in ruins after air
strikes by U.S. warplanes and mortar attacks by Panamanian fighters.
   Residents in many neighborhoods organized vigilante groups to
ward off the looters of homes and businesses who roamed the streets
at will.
   Citizens erected tire barricades and armed themselves for
protection against the anarchy, which spread to middle-class
neighborhoods on Friday.
   ``The only way to protect what little we have left is to protect
it ourselves,'' said Jorge Perez, a 36-year-old homeowner in the
suburb of San Francisco.
   The city's police, part of the Panamanian Defense Forces,
disbanded or collapsed when the invasion began at midnight Tuesday.
   The three-day looting spree left most businesses and grocery
stores depleted of basic foods. Streets were littered with broken
glass and trash.
   Many shopkeepers kept looters at bay with guns. Paying customers
who lined up outside the few supermarkets that opened their doors
complained of shortages.
   Motorists looted some gas stations that failed to open for
business.
   Thousands of people fleeing the fighting sought shelter in
stadiums, churches or schools.
   In the city of Balboa, at the Pacific entrance of the Panama
Canal, about 3,000 refugees jammed a high school sports stadium.
   In the capital, 500 refugees were at the Revolution Soccer
Stadium, 200 at the capital's Venezuela high school, 100 at another
school and 100 more at the Santa Ana Roman Catholic Church.
   Untold thousands slept in public parks and streets. Many just
knocked on stranger's doors and begged to be let in.
   ``First I fled to a stranger's home. But then I had to leave,
and I made my way through the fighting until I was able to reach my
mother's house,'' one man said by telephone from his mother's home,
where 15 others had taken refuge.
   A Red Cross official appealed for food donations as shortages of
many basics worsened. He noted that many people were donating ``as
much as they can spare'' and that many U.S. troops provided
rations, but said much more help was needed.
   Hospitals staffed by doctors and nurses working 16- and 24-hour
shifts were overcrowded with the wounded and the dead and ran short
of everything from alcohol to analgesics to surgical gauze.
   ``Besides everything, not only is there no transportation but
the staff is scared to go outside,'' said Dr. Elmer Miranda, deputy
director of the Santo Tomas Hospital.
   ``The United States only gives us bullets,'' he said.
   He complained that supply flights still were prevented from
entering Panama because the country's airports remained closed
under U.S. military control.
   Miranda said there were 200 bodies in the hospital's basement
morgue. One hospital official estimated there were 1,000 wounded,
most of them civilians.
   One resident surveyed the destroyed building of Noriega's
Defense Forces headquarters. Ringed by tanks, the surrounding area
remained off-limits to civilians, and U.S. soldiers warned people
over loudspeakers to stay away.
   ``Why did they do this?'' the resident asked. ``Just because
they wanted to get Noriega?''

   For the widow of Maj. Moises Giroldi, who led
October's failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the U.S. overthrow of the Panamanian strongman was the welcome
culmination of a sad story.
   But Adela Bonilla de Giroldi said she doesn't think Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who she believes killed of her husband, will ever
see trial in the United States, despite the $1 million bounty
offered by President Bush.
   ``I have faith that they will find him dead,'' she said. ``They
will never catch him alive. It doesn't matter to me if Bush wants
to put a price on Noriega's head. The important thing is that
Noriega doesn't stay in Panama.''
   Mrs. Giroldi, 36, called U.S. Army officials two days before the
failed Oct. 3 coup attempt by her husband to appeal for help. The
coup failed, and Noriega was reported to have executed Giroldi
himself after regaining control. Mrs. Giroldi is among those who
accuse the United States of dooming the coup by failing to support
it quickly enough.
   ``I was so frustrated because President Bush didn't do anything
for my husband,'' Mrs. Giroldi said Thursday in Miami, where she
fled after the failed coup. ``But now, even though many lives have
been lost (in the U.S. invasion), I am relieved. My husband did not
die in vain. His dream of ridding Panama of Noriega has come true.
He is dead but he died for a great cause.''
   Mrs. Giroldi said her husband, a one-time confidante of Noriega,
planned to deliver the general alive to U.S. authorities to face
drug trafficking charges. But Pentagon officials have said Giroldi
planed to let Noriega retire in Panama. The Bush administration its
inaction during the coup attempt stemmed from disagreement among
the rebels about what to do with Noriega.
   Like many Panamanian exiles, Mrs. Giroldi, a mother of three who
worked at the national bank of Panama, said she would return as
soon as stability was restored.
   ``It is our home and we want to help rebuild it,'' she said.

   Panamanians greeted occupying U.S.
forces with some cheers and some sneers but mostly fear, and many
remained at home rather than risk exposure in glass-littered
streets swarming with looters.
   Some of those who did venture out expressed hopes only that the
bloodshed and destruction would cease.
   Businessman Moises Levi pointed at his looted store and then at
an American soldier standing atop a nearby armored personnel
carrier.
   ``How many soldiers are there here, 20,000, 40,000? Where are
they?'' he asked.
   Mayhem and destruction have descended on the city since U.S.
troops began their invasion at midnight Tuesday. Knots of fighters
backing ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega have attacked, then
disappeared, while shopkeepers trade shots with swarms of looters.
   ``They really screwed me up as a businessman,'' said bicycle
shop owner Ivan Rios. ``As a Panamanian, I am opposed to this type
of military action against my country, but I am also glad that at
last we are going to have democracy.''
   Many Panamanians were too frightened to come out of their homes
and display any emotion about the events that rocked their Central
American country, but some did cheer Americans stationed around the
Nicaraguan Embassy.
   Streets in this city of 1 million people were layered with
broken glass, overturned trash cans and fallen light poles. Plumes
of smoke darkened the sky where gunfire and mortar attacks were
launched.
   Two American officers escorted by a dozen American GIs in battle
gear toured the Santo Tomas Hospital. Deputy director Dr. Elmer
Miranda said they were ``on an inspection'' of the building.
   Miranda criticized the Americans because, in addition to dead
and wounded, the assault created a shortage of food and all types
of medicines. He said the closing of airports was preventing aid
from entering the country.
   One administrative employee hurrying along a corridor also
chastized the American action.
   ``They are butchering us. We don't want any help from them,''
she said. ``The United States are courageous with Panama, but they
do not dare meddle with Russia or Japan.''
   Out on the streets, though, a busload of civilians passing by
the Nicaraguan Embassy on Friday morning waved white handkerchiefs
and cheered the U.S. soldiers standing by their armored cars.
   The Americans, who cordoned off the embassy following rumors
that Noriega was there, smiled and waved back.
   Marine Lance Cpl. Tracy Scott Jones of Dallas said that after
the shock of the first day's battle, ``People were cheering us on.
They are on our side. They clapped as we rolled through the
streets. There was no hostility.''
   Lance Cpl. William Young of Seattle said civilians were
``friendly. They give us the thumbs up sign.''
   ``When you go out on a mission at night the situation is pretty
tense. You just look at the darkness and all you can see are the
shapes of people,'' said Young. ``But, then when you go out in the
day, people are pretty friendly.''

   The Senate ethics committee says it's formally
investigating five senators who intervened with regulators for a
troubled savings and loan, and a sixth accused of influence
peddling.
   The lawmakers are using the announcement to again proclaim their
innocence.
   The committee said Friday it has begun preliminary inquiries of
the six _ the first of three possible investigative steps _ but
emphasized in a statement it ``has taken no position as to the
merits of the allegations or the weight of the evidence.''
   In the savings and loan case, the ethics panel will probe the
activities of Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Banking
Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle, Jr., D-Mich.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
Congressional watchdog Common Cause asked for the investigation.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. will be the subject of the
influence-peddling inquiry, expected to focus in part on the award
of federal housing money to the senator's political contributors. A
complaint was filed by a political opponent of the senator.
   ``It's a good move,'' said Murray Flander, press secretary to
Cranston in a comment that echoed the sentiments expressed by the
other five lawmakers.
   ``The fact that they are conducting a full preliminary
investigation and the fact that he will be cleared, this will
obviate any charges of whitewash afterwards,'' he said.
   A preliminary inquiry determines whether there is reason to
believe Senate rules were broken. An affirmative finding is needed
before the committee would proceed to the next level.
   Cranston, Riegle, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn received a
combined $1.3 million for their campaigns and causes from Charles
H. Keating Jr., who headed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine,
Calif. The senators met with regulators on Keating's behalf in 1987.
   The government didn't seize control of Lincoln until last April
14, and the eventual cost to taxpayers is expected to reach a
record level _ for a thrift failure _ of more than $2 billion.
   The ethics committee, headed by Sens. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., had hired an outside counsel, Robert Bennett
of Washington, to determine whether a formal probe should begin in
the Lincoln case. Another Washington attorney, Henry Schuelke,
performed the same role in the D'Amato case. The panel said both
counsels had recommended the preliminary inquiries.
   McCain spokesman Scott Selley said, ``The senator has cooperated
fully with the committee and will continue to do so. Frankly we
think they'll find there was nothing wrong with what Senator McCain
did.''
   DeConcini commented, `I welcome a thorough evaluation of the
facts and feel confident that I will be exnerated.''
   Glenn was out of town and not available, said assistant press
secretary Paul Brinkman.
   D'Amato said he was delighted with the announcement and
predicted, ``My actions are going to be proven to be correct,
responsible, and the work appropriate in every matter.''
   Riegle's office issued a statement that the senator ``strongly
supports this review and knows it will determine his conduct to
have been entirely proper.''

   The staff of a Panama City hotel helped hide a
group of Americans from Panamanian Defense Forces troops who were
looking for American citizens to take hostage after the U.S.
invasion, members of the group said.
   ``We were playing hide and seek with the PDF,'' said Jay
Skinner, an Eastern Airlines pilot. ``The Marriott employees helped
us stay one step ahead of them.''
   On Tuesday night, hours before U.S. troops launched their
military action to oust Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Skinner and his crew arrived in Panama City on a routine flight
from Miami.
   At 1 a.m. Wednesday they awoke at the Marriott Hotel to the
sound of gunfire.
   ``I woke up when it started,'' said Skinner, 45, who was a
helicopter pilot in Vietnam. ``I saw the tracers going and heard
gunshots and I said `Here we go.' ''
   The pilot and his co-pilot, Ron Smith, peered out their windows
and saw smoke and gun-toting Panamanians. The invasion had begun.
   After staying in his room all night, Smith phoned downstairs for
breakfast about 9:00 a.m.
   ``That's when the hotel employees came up and took us down to
the basement,'' Smith said. Hotel staff explained that the PDF was
after U.S. citizens.
   While the PDF searched the hotel's upper floors, the crew and
other Americans hid in the basement. Some of the flight attendants
hid inside industrial-sized washing machines, while Smith said he
covered himself with a cloth and hid in a ditch.
   Skinner said the group changed hiding places frequently. He said
his military training helped him lead troops from the 82nd Airborne
to the group's final hiding place Wednesday night.
   He first established telephone contact with Eastern, and worked
out a code to help the troops pinpoint the group's location.
   ``They came right to us,'' he said. ``It worked like a
fine-oiled machine.''
   Smith and Joseph Andraos, the crew's second officer, both
praised Skinner's skill in handling the situation.
   ``Jay Skinner is an example of what a captain should be,'' said
Andraos. ``He kept things under control.''
   Skinner, Smith and Andraos were greeted with cheers from fellow
Eastern employees when they brought their empty plane back to Miami
International Airport Friday afternoon.
   Earlier in the day, a chartered Eastern flight also reached
Miami with Skinner's flight crew and 57 other hotel guests _
including those Skinner protected from the PDF.
   The fighting upset the gambling streak of one of the passengers,
Fairborn Maxwell, a 45-year-old Jamaican who was in the casino when
the Panamanians stormed the hotel. They briefly held him but
released him when they found he was not American.
   ``I was winning with a stack of chips when they came in and took
us,'' he said ruefully.
   He brought his chips back to Miami, because he couldn't cash
them in.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Call Oliver North's Appeal Arguments Unsound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government protected its case against
Oliver L. North from the possible taint of his immunized testimony,
Iran-Contra prosecutors assert in opposing North's bid to get his
convictions reversed.
   In a 70-page federal appeals court brief Friday, prosecutors
characterized as ``legally and factually unsound'' North's argument
that the government won three felony convictions against him
without properly guarding against all use of immunized testimony he
gave on Capitol Hill.
   ``The extraordinary protective procedures undertaken'' by
prosecutors and the court ``assured that North's immunized
testimony did not contribute to his conviction,'' said associate
independent counsel Gerald Lynch.
   Prosecutors in the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
were instructed to avoid learning the ontents of immunized
testimony from any source in the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who presided at North's
trial, ``undertook extraordinary efforts to protect North's
rights,'' Lynch said.
   North told the appeals court last month he was convicted with
``a stunning disregard'' for his 5th Amendment rights against
self-incrimination.
   ``North does not contend ... that any of the government's trial
witnesses were discovered as a result of his congressional
testimony, or that a single specific piece of grand jury or trial
evidence was derived from that testimony,'' responded the
prosecution.
   Walsh's office said North ``objects only to the trial court's
alleged failure `to follow the procedures established to protect
core Fifth Amendment rights.'''
   North's appeal is scheduled for argument Feb. 6.
   The prosecution also said Gesell made the correct decision in
quashing North's subpoena seeking to compel former President Reagan
to testify at his trial. North said his activities were authorized
by the president and is raising Reagan's absence at the trial as an
issue on appeal.
   ``North could not identify a single instance where President
Reagan directly told him to formulate a false chronology or to
commit other obstructions,'' said the court filing.
   ``North's almost total lack of direct contact with the president
is apparent'' from evidence collected by Walsh's office and from
North's own testimony at his trial, said the prosecution.

   Two farmers in the Berkshire Hills are
selling stock in a piece of summer, marketing $10 notes redeemable
in fruit and vegetables at their produce stands starting in June.
   The ``pay now, eat later'' approach is more or less the same one
employed by the Chicago futures markets _ only on a tiny scale.
   The notes will give farmers a short-term loan over the winter
when business is slow and costs, such as heating greenhouses, are
high, said Susan Witt of Share, a non-profit group that works to
improve the region's economy.
   They also will help build the customer base for the stands owned
by Don Ziegler and Dan Tawczynski, she said.
   The dollar-bill-sized Berkshire Farm Preserve Notes, which went
on sale Thursday, are green and decorated with hand-drawn fruit and
vegetables and the slogan ``In Farms We Trust.''
   They cost $9 but will be worth $10 when redeemed in June, July
and August at the Ziegler and Tawczynski stands in western
Massachusetts.
   ``It's really being used as a self-financing tool,'' Witt said.
``It's a way of saying, `No, we don't have to be dependent on
federal loan programs, state loan programs. We the customers can
support the businesses that we shop at ourselves.'''
   In October, Share was involved in a similar project. Great
Barrington delicatessen owner Frank Tortoriello made a successful
issue of Deli Dollars, certificates worth $10 in future food at his
establishment. He needed to raise money to move the delicatessen.
   Agriculture Commissioner August Schumacher Jr. launched the
farmers' issue by buying two notes Thursday. With the notes came
promotional literature calling on consumers to ``invest now in your
summer cravings for Berkshire-grown plants and veggies.''
   ``I'm intrigued with it,'' Schumacher said. ``I think we
certainly want to support the community's efforts to support their
local farmers. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out.''
   At the Tawczynski stand, called Taft Farms, about $700,000 in
sales were rung up last year, said Martha Tawczynski. But winter
costs are high, with 3,000 gallons of oil burned this year already
to keep the greenhouses warm.
   Turning to the community, rather than to a bank, to raise spring
seed money came naturally to the farm families, Mrs. Tawczynski
said.
   ``These are just local people ... they're our friends,'' she
said. ``We get to know people across the counter.''
   Ziegler and Tawczynski had been discussing the idea for some
weeks, but the it took on urgency when a severe fire destroyed part
of Ziegler's stand earlier this year.
   His stand, the Corn Crib, is operating again, but money has been
tighter than it usually is during the non-productive winter months,
Ziegler said.
   ``You're always spending more money than you're beginning to
make,'' he said.
   If the farm notes work for the two farmers, Share hopes to
extend the program to other local operations, Witt said.
   ``The idea seems right for this area. It's a flexible idea and
other people have taken it up and seen how they could use it and
that is encouraging,'' she said.
   The concept may be limited to tightly knit areas such as the
Berkshire Hill communities, she said.
   ``It's a rural New England area that likes to help out itself,''
she said. ``Its local connections are very strong and that's why it
works.''

   Army units joined outraged Romanians
in toppling President Nicolae Ceausescu on Friday, but fierce
battles raged a day later between popular forces and those loyal to
the Soviet bloc's last dictator.
   Hundreds of people were reported killed in the fighting.
   A provisional government, apparently with the military's full
backing, was in control in most places but still encountered fierce
resistance from pro-Ceausescu security forces in several cities,
Bucharest radio reported.
   The popular forces took control of the communications centers on
Friday and arrested key figures from the Ceausescu regime, but
there was no clear word on the fate of Ceausescu and his wife
Elena, formerly the second-in-command.
   The couple's son Nicu was among those held.
   Shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday, Bucharest radio said all
political detainees had been released.
   Earlier in the day, the chief of the dreaded Securitate secret
police, Gen. Iulian Vlad told the nation on Bucharest radio that
the Interior Ministry had rid itself of ``elements loyal to the
Ceaucescu clan.''
   He appealed to security troops _ who long terrorized the
population at Ceausescu's command _ to ``serve the highest cause,
namely the defense of the entire Romanian people's freedom.''
   However, fighting flared in the capital at dawn Saturday,
apparently between army units at television headquarters and
Ceausescu loyalists in surrounding apartment buildings.
   About 2:30 a.m. Saturday, Ceausescu loyalists had tried to seize
radio and television headquarters _ about two miles apart _ but
army troops repulsed the attacks.
   The facilities were take by popular forces Friday and were
broadcasting declarations from the country's newly declared
provisional government that included a vow to embrace democracy and
hold free elections next year.
   Heavy fighting was reported continuing Saturday in Brasov, the
country's second-largest city. It had also reportedly been intense
Friday night in the western city of Timisoara, where the revolt
began on Dec. 15.
   On Friday morning, Ceausescu fled his presidential palace as
hundreds of thousands of Romanians called for his death in
retaliation for the massacre of their countrymen in a military
crackdown unleashed a week ago in Timisoara.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Ceausescu was hunted down
and captured, although it gave no details. There was no
confirmation of the capture in Romanian media, and the whereabouts
of the man who ruled Romania with an iron fist since 1965 were
unknown.
   The death toll in the uprising was believed to be in the
hundreds, in addition to the thousands of civilians killed since
the start of the unrest. Television broadcast an appeal to doctors
and medical students to go to city hospitals to help the injured.
   The tumult capped a historic year of change in the Soviet bloc
that elsewhere was relatively bloodless: Solidarity took power in
Poland, Hungary ousted its Communist hard-liners and opened its
borders, and old-guard regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria were thrown out in swift succession.
   Provisional leader Ion Iliescu appeared on Romanian TV along
with other members of a National Salvation Committee that the media
said was formed to run the country temporarily. Iliescu, an old
acquaintance of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and former
Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu said free elections would be
sought by April.
   ``In a few days we shall calm down, bury our dead and will be
consciously building new, free and democratic life,'' the Soviet
news agency Tass quoted Romanian poet Mirca Dinescu as saying.
   Besides free elections, the National Salvation Committee said it
was committed to a pluralistic society; continued membership in the
Warsaw Pact; the idea of a ``common European home'' _ an idea
espoused by Gorbachev; abolishment of all structures of the
Ceausescu dictatorship; and placement of the army and the security
apparatus under the control of the civil government.
   Romanian media, now pledging honest reporting, said Ceausescu
and his wife fled the palace by helicopter early Friday. The palace
was later was set ablaze.
   It also was reported they had fled the country. But Tanjug said
late Friday night that they had been captured, along with other
ranking members of the old guard. It was not known where they were.
   China on Saturday denied giving sanctuary to Ceausescu.
   Nicu Ceausescu was shown on TV with a bloody face, his arms held
by a civilian and a man in a uniform. He was then taken away by his
captors.
   When security forces attacked the radio and TV headquarters in
Bucharest during the night, occupants of the TV building ducked as
shots were fired toward the windows and the lights went out.
   Rebel soldiers inside returned fire, pinning down the security
forces, and repulsed the attack after about two hours.
   The TV station stayed on the air during the attack, with
reporter Victor Ionesco exhorting residents of Bucharest to come to
scene of the shooting. ``Come help us,'' he implored. ``We're
helping you.''
   People who had been chanting outside the TV building only
minutes before the shooting scattered briefly during the attack,
but they came back and cheered when tanks on side of the uprising
took up new positions around the building. Rebel troops also were
located on the building's roof.
   A crowd of about 3,000 people then took up a vigil through the
night outside the building, continuing their chants for liberty.
   Maria Elena Ionesco, the TV reporter's wife, said the attack at
the radio station also was put down. ``It's over. We've won. We've
won,'' she said.
   Maj. Gen. Stefan Gusa, the first deputy defense minister who
joined the uprising, said on Bucharest radio Saturday morning that
``the army and the people are in control of the situation, although
there are still scattered pockets of opposition in the country.''
   A source in Timisoara said pro-Ceausescu commandos dropped by
parachute had descended on the town and tanks were rolling into
downtown. Tanjug later reported the fighting had died down.
   In Brasov, official radio broadcasted an urgent appeal for rebel
reinforcements. Bucharest radio reported heavy fighting around the
central telephone exchange.
   The 24-year reign of the East bloc's harshest regime collapsed
in one breathtaking week of protests that began with a small rally
for a persecuted pastor in Timisoara and led to Friday's nationwide
uprising by millions.
   Only last month, Ceausescu was overwhelmingly reaffirmed as
supreme leader by a fiercely obedient Communist Party conference
that paid homage to his personality cult. On Thursday, during a
speech in central Bucharest, he was shouted down by jeering
demonstrators.
   After Ceausescu fled Bucharest Friday morning, hundreds of
thousands of jubilant Romanians rallied in the capital for hours,
even as there were reports of fighting between rebel troops and
pro-Ceausescu forces. About 2,000 pro-Ceausescu forces then
attacked the city later Friday, Romanian TV reported.

   A Jewish group will be allowed to erect a

   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. on Friday vacated a

<NOTE>U.S. Planning to Resume Loans to Iraq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Bush administration plan to lift a
congressional ban on loans to Iraq is likely to antagonize
lawmakers critical of Iraq's human rights abuses and credit
problems.
   Officials say President Bush will exercise his right to lift the
ban, imposed by Congress several months ago, on grounds of U.S.
national interests. The officials, who spoke Friday on condition of
anonymity, said the move is expected within several weeks.
   U.S. oil companies and other businesses have exerted heavy
pressure on the administration to broaden trade ties with Iraq
since the 1988 end of its ruinous eight-year war with Iran.
   Congress voted to suspend $200 million in annual short-term
credits to Iraq by the Export-Import Bank, a U.S. government
institution that promotes the export of American goods. To head off
a presidential veto and respond to pressure from U.S. businesses,
Congress agreed to incorporate the executive branch's right to a
waiver.
   ``But there were many up here who didn't like it and wanted a
flat-out prohibition on Iraq,'' said a congressional source who
spoke on condition he not be named.

   When Rocky Peterson set up an elaborate
lighting display this Christmas season, his girlfriend was left
glowing.
   Peterson proposed to DeDe High by stringing 150 feet of
Christmas lights with the message ``MARRY ME'' across the roof of
his barn in south-central Nebraska.
   It got her attention, and the quick reply of ``yes.''
   ``I wanted to do something special,'' Peterson said recently.
   On the day in late November Peterson hung the lights, he called
Miss High and asked her to meet him out at his place.
   ``As I drove into the driveway he plugged in the lights. I was
caught completely off guard,'' she said.
   ``I was so surprised when I saw the lights that I was
speechless,'' Miss High said. ``In fact it took me a while to
answer. But when I could talk again, I said `Yes.'''
   Peterson said he plans to leave the light display on the barn
until New Year's.
   The couple, both 27, have dated for about a year. Their wedding
date is March 24.

   PINETOP-LAKESIDE, Ariz. (AP) _ There's no business like snow
business in the White Mountains of Arizona. And without snow, the
Pinetop-Lakeside Town Council fears there'll be no business at all
this year.
   The council, noting that Thursday was the first day of winter
and not a flake had fallen, adopted a resolution that day mandating
a white Christmas for the not-so-White Mountains.
   The resolution calls for at least a 6-inch accumulation of snow
on Christmas Day, followed by a regular snowfall each day
thereafter, with a total of 60 inches or more by the end of the
winter.
   The resolution doesn't set a penalty for failure to comply.

   Discredited by Nicolae Ceausescu's harsh
rule and its central role as his loyal cheerleader, the Communist
Party in Romania appears to have little chance of staying at the
helm.
   Ceausescu, who had ruled since 1965 and cut off any attempt at
organized opposition, was overthrown Friday in fierce battles that
left hundreds dead.
   In the bloodiest decision during his long rule, Ceausescu
ordered the use of lethal force one week ago against protesters in
the western city of Timisoara who demanded his ouster.
   Security forces there reportedly killed several thousand people,
including many children and woman, and dumped their bodies into
mass graves in a forest near the city.
   Ceausescu's use of deadly force, intended to perpetuate the last
Stalinist regime in Eastern Europe at any cost, contrasted sharply
with recent Communist responses to protesters in other Soviet bloc
countries.
   Police in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria did not fire
on proteters.
   Romania is different in many ways from its Warsaw Pact allies.
Ceausescu created a personality cult around himself that seemed to
entwine his own political survival with that of the Communist Party.
   Much like North Korea's Kim Il Sung, Ceausescu created a family
dynasty in Romania, with some 40 relatives reportedly placed in key
state and party jobs.
   ``In Romania, the Communist Party existed only to clap and cheer
Ceausescu. It hardly was a political party,'' said Ion Ratiu,
chairman of the London-based World Union of Free Romanians.
   ``After Ceausescu's ouster, the Communist Party will likely
crumble, unlike in Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany where a
degree of divergent views was tolerated,'' said a Romanian exile at
the U.S.-financed Radio Free Europe radio station.
   Mircea Stoica, a professor at Bucharest University who this week
defected to Hungary, said a party congress last month where
Ceausescu was ``unanimously'' elected for another five years was
``actually 90 percent organized and run by the secret police.''
   ``The 5,000 delegates to the congress, before entering the
Palace Hall, were searched for alleged weapons like common
criminals and had to pass through metal detectors. What bigger
humiliation for a Communist do you want?'' Stoica said.
   On Friday, Ion Iliescu, a former Central Committee secretary
ousted by Ceausescu in 1971, announced the formation of the
``National Salvation Front'' described as the ``new organism of
state power.''
   ``We will establish a new structure of political power. The old
structure of party and government was liquidated,'' Iliescu told a
Bucharest crowd.
   ``We will establish a provisional structure, which will prepare
free elections in which the people will be the decisive factor for
our public life,'' he said.
   In a late night statement broadcast live by Romanian radio and
television, Iliescu said the front ``includes all healthy forces in
our country and is supported by the army,'' which rallied with the
people against Ceausescu's security forces.
   The front includes leading dissidents Doina Cornea, Ana
Blandiana, Dumitru Mazilu, Rev. Laszlo Toekes, the protestant
pastor of Hungarian extraction whose persecution sparked the
revolt, former Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu, ex-Washington
Ambassador Silviu Brucan and three army generals.
   Iliescu said the front urges the abandonment of the leading role
of a single party, the organization of free elections by April, and
changing the country's name to Romania, rather than the Socialist
Republic of Romania.
   Iliescu, 59, reported to be an old friend of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev from the years when both studied in Moscow,
made no mention of the Communist Party, an indication that
Ceausescu's former fiefdom will play little if any role in future.
   ``I know how opportunistic Communists are. After Ceausescu's
ouster, tens of thousands of them will throw away the red cards,
saying they hated the party and its leaders,'' said Sandu
Poberzenic of the World Union of Free Romania.
   The Communist party has currently a membership of 3.8 million
members.
   Addressing each other Friday after Ceausescu's ouster, army
generals and other officials used the word ``domnul'' (Mr.) rather
than the word that until now has been mandatory, ``comrade.''
   ``The Romanian Communist Party had been the weakest in the whole
of Eastern Europe before the war when it numbered less than 1,000
members,'' Ratiu said. ``Its policy on international issues often
ran counter to Romanian national aspirations.''
   Still, it was not known how and what other parties will be set
up in Romania to contest the planned elections next year.
   The front's platform made no mention of the country's former
king, Michael, now 67 and living in Switzerland. It emphasized that
a committee will immediately start working out a new constitution.
   ``We must learn how to function as a democracy,'' said dissident
poet Ana Blandiana, now a Front member. ``Let's cleanse the shame
and humility in which we were forced to live in the past 24 years.''

   A county judge described as tough-minded
and outspoken was injured by a pipe bomb delivered to his home, but
authorities said the case appeared to be unrelated to four other
recent bomb attacks.
   Washington County Circuit Judge John P. Corderman, listed in
stable condition today, isn't known to have handled civil rights
cases _ the presumed motive in the earlier attacks, one of which
killed a federal judge.
   Corderman, 47, suffered shrapnel injuries to his abdomen and
right hand, and both eardrums were ruptured in the blast in his
third-floor apartment about 2:30 p.m. Friday, said Chuck Jackson,
Maryland State Police spokesman.
   ``Apparently, the device was situated outside when he arrived
home,'' Jackson said. ``He retrieved it, entered the apartment and
a short time later it exploded. We don't know whether it was opened
or not.''
   Despite his injuries, Corderman left the apartment and activated
a fire alarm about 10 feet outside his front door before collapsing
inside the apartment, Jackson said.
   A second bomb that apparently was in the package was taken to a
nearby city park and detonated.
   George Hopgood, an assistant FBI special agent in charge, said
the latest bomb was dissimilar to the ones that have been found in
the South.
   ``At this time there doesn't appear to be any connection,''
Hopgood said.
   Investigators are checking the possibility the earlier bombings
could have suggested such an attack to some with a grudge against
Corderman, Jackson said.
   In the earlier cases, a nail-packed mail bomb killed Judge
Robert S. Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Dec. 16
at his home outside Birmingham, Ala., and a similar bomb killed
black civil rights attorney Robert E. Robinson two days later at
his Savannah, Ga., office.
   Parcel bombs were found during the week at the Jacksonville,
Fla., chapter of the National Association for the Advancment of
Colored People and the 11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta, where
Vance sat. Both were defused.
   Federal investigators believe the attacks were motivated by the
victims' or groups' role in civil rights cases.
   Vance's colleagues also have received threatening letters,
sources told The Associated Press on Friday. Investigators
disclosed Thursday there had been four follow-up threatening
letters, but refused to divulge who received them.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he
was unaware that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th
Circuit. But he said ``solid evidence'' linked the letters to the
bombers.
   The threatening letters had references to a group called
``Americans for a Competent Judiciary,'' the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution reported today, citing anonymous sources familiar with
the investigation.
   The group isn't known to authorities, said William Hinshaw,
special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office.
   Washington County lawyers said they didn't recall Corderman
dealing with civil rights cases.
   ``He's the kind of gentleman who you like him or don't like
him,'' Baltimore attorney Chris Brown said. ``He has rubbed people
the wrong way.''
   Brown said the judge ``takes unusual stances and gives lawyers a
hard time. He's a very colorful, outspoken, controversial judge.''
   Said to be tough with criminal defendants, Corderman is a board
member of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a gun control
group.
   Washington County State's Attorney M. Kenneth Long described the
judge as ``no-nonsense ... tough-minded, fair, bright and
articulate.''
   Long, who had lunch with Corderman shortly before the blast,
said the judge was in good spirits when he visited him later at
Washington County Hospital, where he was under 24-hour guard.
   ``He was trying to smile and trying to chuckle, but it was
difficult,'' Long said. ``He's grateful to be alive.''
   A neighbor of Corderman's, Steven Keyes, 30, said he saw a
delivery man bring a package to the building about 20 minutes
before the explosion.
   ``It looked like a normal person to me, a normal delivery,''
Keyes said.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contract talks between The San Diego Union and
The Tribune newspapers broke off after a strike deadline passed
early today, but labor officials say they've decided against
walking out at this time.
   Discussions ended after company lawyers rejected a proposal from
the Newspaper Guild in which the union dropped its demand for a
``closed shop'' _ a key issue in the talks.
   Union leaders said a strike could be called any time.
   Representatives of the guild and the Union-Tribune Publishing
Co. met all day Friday without reaching agreement. Company lawyers
told guild officials they didn't plan further proposals at this
time, setting the stage for a possible strike, which would be the
first in the 51 years the guild has represented employees at the
two newspapers.
   Pay is less an issue than disputes over the length of the
contract and preservation of a union shop.
   The company's last proposal called for a one-year pact with
salary hikes of 8 percent to 10 percent, said Herb Klein, editor in
chief of the Copley Newspapers, a 13-paper chain that includes
those involved in the dispute.
   The guild sought a three-year contract with a 10 percent pay
hike the first year and 5 percent raises in the second and third
years.
   The labor team sought guild security under which everyone in
guild-covered positions would pay dues whether they are members or
not, said George Flynn, chairman of the guild's bargaining
committee.
   The company wants an ``open shop'' that would allow individual
workers to decide whether they want to join a union.
   The guild represents about 1,150 employees in the editorial,
photography, circulation, advertising, business, maintenance,
telephone communications and library departments.
   The old contract expired in June 1988.

<HEAD>Energy Department Drops Appeal in Fernald Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has removed one hurdle
to a $78 million settlement with neighbors of the Fernald uranium
processing plant, and revealed another obstacle _ the fact that no
funds are available to pay it.
   The government announced Friday night it was dropping its appeal
of the settlement with 14,000 people who live around the southwest
Ohio plant. They sought the payment for alleged emotional distress
and loss of property values because of radiation releases from the
plant.
   But Stephen A. Wakefield, chief counsel for the Energy
Department, also said the Justice Department had advised him this
week he couldn't pay the $78 million from a federal contingency
fund as planned because the lawsuit wasn't brought against the
government.
   The original lawsuit targeted National Lead of Ohio Inc., which
ran the plant under federal contract until 1985. But the company's
operating contract with the Energy Department shielded it from
liability in such cases.
   The department will have to ask Congress for a special
appropriation to cover the settlement, Wakefield said. Payments
probably will be made in installments, he said.
   ``That's terrible,'' said Paul Nemann, one of three
court-appointed trustees overseeing the settlement. Government
lawyers promised when the lawsuit was settled last summer that the
money would be available by October, he said, but that month the
Energy Department appealed the settlement.
   Residents included in the settlement were happy the government
had dropped its appeal.
   ``We think it's really past time,'' said Lisa Crawford, ``My
question is, when are they going to put the money in the bank?''
   The plaintiffs contended in a 1985 lawsuit that releases of
radioactive material from the plant, which processes weapons-grade
uranium, had reduced their property values and caused them
emotional distress.
   The settlement clears the way for federal funds to pay for
long-term medical monitoring of the health of the 14,000 people
living within five miles of the Feed Materials Production Center at
Fernald, 18 miles from Cincinnati.
   Doctors will study whether an excess of cancers or other health
problems can be traced to radiation released from the plant, which
has operated for 38 years.
   The plant currently is run by Westinghouse Materials Co.
Operations were suspended earlier this year to intensify cleanup
efforts at the site.

<TEXT>
   State television said today that the
Soviet Union had promised military aid to the popular forces that
ousted Nicolae Ceausescu and fighting in fierce battles with elite
police units of the ousted dictator.
   An announcer said without elaboration that the Soviet Embassy
had pledged such aid but did not elaborate on whether it would be
in the form of troops or equipment. In Moscow, Soviet media did not
report such an offer.
   The announcement followed an appeal broadcast by the television
from an unidentified army general, who urged Moscow to step in
because ``terrorist units'' loyal to Ceausescu had sent
reinforcements to the capital.
   Hundreds of people were killed in clashes in Bucharest between
the army, which sided with the revolt against Ceausescu, and police
forces that included Ceausescu's personal anti-terrorist squad.
   As dawn broke over Bucharest, anti-Ceausescu soldiers posted
atop the TV building fought with pockets of loyalists in nearby
apartment buildings in a firefight that lit up the early morning
sky.
   The general's appeal came shortly after 6 a.m. as the
anti-Ceausescu forces repulsed an attack on the television
building, which the popular forces seized on Friday and from which
they broadcast plans to hold free elections by April.

   A state-funded abortion program that had
been sliced in half earlier in the year ran dry this week,
curtailing for six months the only state-funded abortion program in
the Southeast, officials said.
   The legislature cut the fund during its summer session from last
year's level of $924,000 to $424,500 for the fiscal year, and the
last funds were spent Tuesday, John Tanner of the state Department
of Human Resources said Friday. The new fiscal year begins July 1.
   North Carolina is one of only 11 states in the country that has
a fund for abortions for poor women.
   Republican state Rep. Paul Stam, who led the budget-slashing
effort in summer, said the House had rejected an amendment he
offered that would have eliminated state-funded abortions for birth
control purposes.
   If the fund had been limited to pay for abortion in cases of
rape, incest or where the mother's life is threatened, it would
have lasted through the fiscal year, he said.
   ``What we have done over the last 5{ months is spend 96 or 98
percent of the money on birth control abortions, so there is no
money left,'' Stam said. ``It's a crazy way to allocate the funds _
first-come, first-served.''
   ``I think it just reinforces that there is a great need for the
fund,'' countered state Rep. Sharon Thompson, a Democrat. ``It is
tragically unfair that whether or not you receive help from the
fund depends on what time of the year you get pregnant.''
   Poor women have few choices left with the state funds gone, said
Ruth Ziegler of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``Our organization would like to see that every woman in this
state that feels the need to make a choice to have an abortion
would have freedom to make a choice,'' Ms. Ziegler said. ``We feel
rich women as well as poor women should be able to make that
choice.''

<DATELINE>DAVID, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Panamanian Defense Forces
stacked their guns and raised a white flag in Panama's westernmost
city, even though the only sign of U.S. force was two Air Force
planes that buzzed the barracks.
   ``I was just doing my job. I'm not happy about the situation,''
said one police officer, who refused to give his name. The police
are part of the Defense Forces that were commanded by ousted
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Although Noriega was toppled from power by U.S. forces early
Wednesday, he escaped the net thrown by 24,000 U.S. soldiers,
sailors and Marines.
   No U.S. troops showed up in David, despite reports of shooting
and fighting in the area, 200 miles west of Panama City and 30
miles east of Costa Rica.
   On Thursday, two Air Force jets buzzed the Defense Forces
barracks in the center of David, witnesses said.
   On Friday, members of the Defense Forces raised a white banner
across the front of the barracks and 100 turned in their weapons,
except for sidearms.
   ``They just stacked their weapons in a pickup truck,'' said
Carlos Antonio Rios, a photographer for the Houston Chronicle who
had entered Panama from Costa Rica. A small crowd gathered in front
of the barracks and waved American flags during the afternoon.
   Rumors that Noriega himself was in the area were rife during the
day, but none could be confirmed. Rumors that he had been captured
were scotched by U.S. Army spokesmen. Defense Forces members said
they didn't know where Noriega was.
   Unlike in Panama City, there were only scattered incidents of
looting, local residents said, largely because members of the
Defense Forces continued to police the streets. At one point,
Defense Forces members blocked the entrance to a store and
prevented armed men from entering.
   ``If they want me to work, I'll work,'' said the Defense Forces
policeman, when asked if he would work for the newly installed
president, Guillermo Endara. ``If they don't, I won't. Whatever
they want.''

   A moveable span on a floating bridge opened
unexpectedly during a test, thrusting a steel wall in front of
rush-hour traffic and causing pileups that killed one woman and
injured at least six other people.
   Department of Transportation officials were at a loss to explain
the wreck on the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge across Lake
Washington during a test that has been conducted weekly for 18
years without a hitch. The test of electronic circuits doesn't
involve moving the span.
   But during Friday's test, the span rose 4{ feet without warning
in about three seconds, creating a wall that three vehicles drove
into head-on.
   Raili Korkka, 44, was killed, police said. Three people were
hospitalized in serious but stable condition with a variety of
injuries and three others were either treated at the scene or
briefly hospitalized, according to police and hospital officials.
   Motorist Mark Bauty said his car bounced over the lip of the
drawspan just as it started to open and he could hear tires
screeching and metal crunching behind him.
   ``The bridge was probably six inches high I guess when I hit it
and the car made it over the front end, kept right on going and
flew off the back end when the bridge was probably about a
foot-and-a-half to two feet high,'' Bauty said.
   Several cars were left perched on the elevated section of the
bridge, some with blown tires and mangled metal from hitting the
rising span. No cars went into the water.
   Operator error has been just about ruled out in the 8:50 a.m.
accident, said department spokeswoman Leslie Salisbury, who
explained the bridge-opening sequence requires 18 distinct steps.
   ``When the operator got to the 10th step, for some reason one
part of the drawspan opened up,'' she said.
   Transportation Department crews ran through the procedure three
times Friday afternoon, ``and every time we got to that step the
drawspan opened,'' Salisbury said.
   The step should not have involved the drawspan mechanism at all,
she said. One expert ``likened it to turning on your windshield
wipers and having the radio come on instead,'' Salisbury said.
   The 25-year-old, 2-mile-long bridge is supported for 7,000 feet
on concrete pontoons, making it the world's longest floating
bridge. Two steel-grid spans, each 100 feet long, can be raised
about 7 feet to make room for boats to pass beneath.
   Preliminary inspections didn't turn up any damage, but workers
plan to inspect the bridge further on Tuesday, and to close the
bridge briefly in January for a more detailed look, Salisbury said.
The department also has recommended an independent consultant be
hired to investigate.
   The operator of the bridge has been with the department for 10
years and has run the bridge for one year, following two years of
training, Salisbury said.
   The operator was distraught and was treated by medics 45 minutes
after the accident, said Daryl Rush, district bridge maintenance
superintendent for DOT.
   Opening the drawspan, which creates a 200-foot opening, is
necessary only 30 to 40 times a year because most vessels can pass
under elevated portions of the bridge at each end, Rush said.
   Evergreen Point Bridge, formally known as the Albert D.
Rosellini Bridge, carries an average of 100,000 vehicles daily.

   The first revolts against Nicolae Ceausescu that
led to his downfall occurred in the western Romanian city of
Timisoara, where thousands were said to have been killed by troops.
Here is a report from the city by an AP correspondent who traveled
overland from Yugoslavia.

   The people who began the revolution
that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu danced and cheered when he fled
Bucharest, then cried bitterly over mass graves filled with the
victims of the dictator's henchmen.
   The bittersweet celebration occurred Friday in Timisoara, the
western city where thousands were reported killed in protests that
spread nationwide.
   Residents hurled the omnipresent portraits of Ceausescu onto
bonfires that blazed around town. They fed the flames with signs
ripped down from buildings that praised him and bore his platitudes
on building Communism.
   ``This is something we never expected to happen,'' said resident
Ingeborg Kziraska. ``The dictator is gone.''
   The streets of the Transylvanian city still showed signs of the
bloodbath that occurred when Ceausescu's security forces opened
fire on demonstrators last weekend. Shops were burned out and
official buildings heavily damaged.
   Kziraska spoke outside the cathedral where she said 30 children
had been gunned down.
   Inside the cathedral, a memorial service was under way with
about 2,000 people attending. Religious freedom _ and other civil
liberties _ were severely curtailed under Ceausescu's draconian
rule.
   Residents in the city estimated Friday that 2,000 to 4,500
people had been killed, although there was no way to verify those
figures. Police reportedly had opened fire on crowds shouting
``Bread!'' and ``Down with Ceausescu!''
   But Romanian radio, which was in the hands of the people who
toppled Ceausescu, said today that more than 12,000 people were
killed in Timisoara alone since the uprising began Dec. 15 with
demonstrations in the city.
   Yugoslav media said soldiers and police who refused to fire on
anti-government protesters in Timisoara were executed.
   The city itself became a symbol and its name was chanted at a
huge anti-Ceausescu protest in the capital of Bucharest on Thursday.
   Hundreds of people were digging up mass graves discovered in the
forest district of Timisoara, trying to find the remains of their
friends and relatives killed in last weekend's crackdown.
   Three such mass graves are believed to be holding up to 4,500
corpses of people massacred by the dreaded security forces on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
   Vasile Todorescu, an electrician, said he was trying to find his
20-year-old son, who disappeared during the unrest. He said corpses
had been transported by garbage trucks to the area and the drivers
were later shot by the police so that no witnesses whould be left.
   Civilians wearing ribbons on their sleeves were attempting to
maintain order in Timisoara, as people danced joyfully in the
streets and flashed ``V'' for victory signs.
   Many rode around in trucks. People waved Romanian flags with the
socialist emblem cut out of the middle. Others carried banners
calling for an end to repression.
   On Thursday, Timisoara was reported in the hands of a strike
committee that reportedly had occupied factories and official
buildings.
   But on Friday all 350,000 residents of the city that is 30 miles
from the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders and 500 miles from
Bucharest seemed to be on the streets.
   Intellectuals had formed a Committee for Socialist Democracy
this week that presented to Premier Constantin Dascalescu a series
of demands for Ceausescu's resignation, free elections and full
investigation of the weekend shooting.
   The intellectuals had also demanded the admission of foreign
journalists to Romania and publication of its demands.
   Western reporters, allowed into Romania on Friday for the first
time since the unrest was reported and the Bucharest leadership
sealed the country's borders, saw that nearly every other shop in
Timisoara had been gutted. Several official buildings had been
devastated.
   The protests in Timisaora grew out of an attempt by a few
hundred people Dec. 15 to prevent the arrest of a Reformed Church
pastor who had sought refuge in his church.
   The whereabouts of the ethnic Hungarian clergyman, the Rev.
Laszlo Toekes, was unknown until Friday, when Hungarian radio
reported that he was alive and was on his way to the Transylvanian
city of Tirgu Mures to celebrate services. Nearly half of the
population in that city is ethnic Hungarian.

   The Bush administration will consider aid to
the new government taking shape in Romania once it dismantles the
system inherited from ousted President Nicolae Ceaucescu and
institutes reforms, officials say.
   The White House and the State Department hailed the demise of
Ceaucescu's hard-line government Friday and expressed hope for a
peaceful transition to democracy.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher credited the
``courageous and persistent action by the Romanian people'' who
prevailed ``in the face of great odds and despite bloody
repression.''
   Ceausescu's ouster seemed to foreshadow an improvement in
U.S.-Romanian relations, which have been under severe strain,
particularly since last weekend when anti-government uprisings
began.

   People took up arms and formed
vigilante squads to combat looting and thousands jammed churches,
stadiums and schools to flee fighting that has ravaged the capital.
Food and medicine were in short supply.
   As the U.S. military occupation entered its fourth day today,
weary and frightened residents stayed behind locked doors to avoid
street battles between fighters loyal to ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and American forces.
   Much of this city of 1 million people was in ruins after air
strikes by U.S. warplanes and mortar attacks by Panamanian fighters.
   Residents in many neighborhoods organized vigilante groups to
ward off the looters of homes and businesses who roamed the streets

   Military leaders predicted the operation that began early
Wednesday would take another 10 days.
   ``The decision has been made,'' said the Pentagon source,

   A county judge described as tough-minded
and outspoken was injured by a pipe bomb delivered to his home, but
authorities said the case appeared to be unrelated to four other
recent bomb attacks.
   Washington County Circuit Judge John P. Corderman, listed in
stable condition today, isn't known to have handled civil rights
cases _ the presumed motive in the earlier attacks, one of which
killed a federal judge.
   Corderman, 47, suffered shrapnel injuries to his abdomen and
right hand, and both eardrums were ruptured in the blast in his
third-floor apartment about 2:30 p.m. Friday, said Chuck Jackson,
Maryland State Police spokesman.
   ``Apparently, the device was situated outside when he arrived
home,'' Jackson said. ``He retrieved it, entered the apartment and
a short time later it exploded. We don't know whether it was opened

   The Senate ethics committee says it's formally
investigating five senators who intervened with regulators for a
troubled savings and loan, and a sixth accused of influence
peddling.
   The lawmakers are using the announcement to again proclaim their
innocence.
   The committee said Friday it has begun preliminary inquiries of
the six _ the first of three possible investigative steps _ but
emphasized in a statement it ``has taken no position as to the
merits of the allegations or the weight of the evidence.''
   In the savings and loan case, the ethics panel will probe the
activities of Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Banking
Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle, Jr., D-Mich.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
Congressional watchdog Common Cause asked for the investigation.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. will be the subject of the
influence-peddling inquiry, expected to focus in part on the award
of federal housing money to the senator's political contributors. A
complaint was filed by a political opponent of the senator.

   A federal court ruling could mean 6{ more
years in prison for two brothers found guilty of bank fraud in the
collapse of their Northern California savings and loan, a
prosecutor said.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham, made public
Friday, found Leif and Jay Soderling guilty of contempt of court
and violating their probation for indulging in a $500,000 spending
spree during a court-ordered freeze on their assets.
   The ruling should send Leif and Jay Soderling of Windsor, north
of San Francisco, back to prison for 6{ years, said prosecutor
Ronald Smetana, because of the violation of probation conditions in
their original sentence.
   The Soderlings' lawyer, Richard Freeman, could not be reached
Friday.
   In 1987, the brothers pleaded guilty to bank fraud and were
sentenced to seven years in prison. But most of the sentence was
suspended and they spent about nine months in prison before their
release last year.
   Smetana said the Soderlings owe about $4.8 million out of $6.7
million in restitution required by their sentence, and are being
sued by federal bank regulators for additional amounts lost in the
failure of their Golden Pacific Savings and Loan in 1985.
   Peckham said the Soderlings violated his order requiring them to
cooperate with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in paying
restitution, and prohibiting them from spending any of their assets
without court approval, except for $2,500 per family in living
expenses.
   The judge said family trust funds created by the brothers spent
$500,000 between September and December 1988, shortly after the
order was issued, without seeking court approval or notification.
   The money was used, among other things, to buy cars, computers,
cellular phones and a horse trailer, Peckham said.
   The brothers argued that the money was spent by their wives and
that the trust funds were immune from restitution. Jay Soderling's
wife, Evelyn, and Leif's wife, Sydney, are awaiting trial
separately for contempt of court.
   Rejecting the Soderlings' claim that they were not given notice
of the terms of their probation, Peckham said they appeared to
believe ``they can continue to push the line of legality in new and
creative ways, and the burden is on the government to anticipate
every possible maneuver.''

   Romania's uprising turned into a
battle for the airwaves today, as members of ousted dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu's despised security forces tried to retake
national television and radio stations.
   National television showed the bloody faces of some people
crowding one of its studios after apparently fleeing the fighting
outside.
   The provisional government formed after army units joined the
masses in toppling Ceausescu on Friday, appealed for help.
   ``Army units and citizens we need you,'' a Bucharest radio
announcer implored. ``Block off the radio-television area.''
   Machine-gun fire and the sound of light tank shells filled the
air and tracers crossed the smoky skyline outside the government TV
building at dawn in a firefight between army units and Ceausescu
loyalists.
   The attackers appeared mostly to be in surrounding apartment
buildings. Bullets and rocket-propelled grenades hit the TV
building, and a TV announcer reported without elaborating that
injuries resulted.
   As today's firefight started, Marin Constantin, normally editor
of youth programs, took charge of herding staff and visitors into
hallways, away from windows.
   ``Safe here, halfway,'' he said, noting the eighth floor was a
safe compromise between first and 13th. He seized a wooden chair
and smashed a ceiling light to darken the corridor.
   Gratiela Ripeanu, who normally handles visitors and external
relations for the TV station, chuckled as the noise grew deafening.
   ``Are you a war correspondent?'' she chided a colleague far more
used to reporting on rallies and government communiques.
   A MiG fighter jet flew low overhead, and TV reporters said it
was in a dogfight with diehard units. But that could not be
independently confirmed.
   The new army-backed leadership on Friday used the newly captured
TV to broadcast demonstrations nationwide and propose new elections
next year. Ceausescu's son, Nicu, was shown with a bloody face
after he was arrested.
   About 2:30 a.m. today, Ceausescu loyalists in the security
forces tried to seize radio and TV headquarters _ about two miles
apart _ and were beaten back. Then they counterattacked.
   The TV station stayed on the air during the first attack, with
reporter Victor Ionesco exhorting residents of Bucharest to come to
scene of the shooting. ``Come help us,'' he implored. ``We're
helping you.''
   People who had been chanting outside the TV building only
minutes before the shooting scattered briefly during the attack,
but they came back and cheered when tanks on side of the uprising
took up new positions around the building.
   A crowd of about 3,000 people then took up a vigil through the
night outside the building, continuing their chants for liberty.

   Temperatures were in the single digits throughout the nation
early today, as an arctic cold front extended as far south as
Florida.
   Snow blanketed parts of the Carolinas and Jacksonville, Fla.,
while other parts of the South also shivered under unusually low
temperatures. Temperatures in Tennessee plunged to 0 in Memphis and
6 below in Nashville, and in Georgia a sheet of ice and up to 2
inches of snow covered the state's Golden Isles, normally a holiday
haven of winter golf among the palm trees. Temperatures fell to 6
below in Louisville.
   The deep freeze continued in the Northeast, with temperatures
today dropping to 3 degrees in Portland, Maine, 5 in Boston and 8
in New York. Snow fell amid 0 degree temperatures in Pittsburgh.
   In the Midwest, temperatures dropped to 20 below in Des Moines,
Ill., and Kansas City, Mo. Snow also fell today in Michigan and
Ohio.
   More than 125 cities reported record low temperatures for the
date Friday, with the town of Rochford in the Black Hills of
western South Dakota reporting a low of 60 degrees below 0.

   Records lows Friday included Pittsburgh at 12 below; Tulsa 6
below; Oklahoma City at 4 below; Denver at 18 below, and
Scottsbluff, Neb., at 42 below. A low of 23 degrees below zero made
it the coldest day ever in Kansas City, Mo.
   In parts of central Montana, a warm front caused a rapid rise in
Temperatures Friday. Cutbank went from a morning low of 34 below to
an afternoon high of 40.
   Fair skies and seasonable temperatures prevailed in the West
Friday. Temperatures warmed into the 60s and 70s in southern
Arizona and even into the 80s in parts of Southern California.

<HEAD>School Officials Censor Student Paper for Explicit Articles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 8th graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLMDEL TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School officials censored a
student-run newspaper that ran several stories on sex education
which were deemed inappropriate, including one that explained how
to use a condom.
   Principal Richard White at Holmdel High School said he met with
the eight-student editorial board of The Sting on Friday and agreed
to allow the paper to publish without the three stories in question
on Jan. 2, when classes resume.
   Craig LaCava, the newspaper's 18-year-old editor, said the
articles were prompted by the 800-student school's inadequate sex
education program.
   ``We get a week of it freshman year, then a good course that
lasts several weeks during senior year,'' LaCava said. ``By then
it's much, much too late.''
   ``We decided to do this because we think parents should know how
uniformed their kids are about these things,'' he said. ``We were
very concerned about the pregnancy and abortion rate in our
school.''
   ``I had agreed the students had a valid issue,'' said White.
``But one article in particular, on skills and techniques of using
a condom, was just inappropriate for a school newspaper.''
   The articles, one each dealing with sexually transmitted
diseases, sex education curriculum and condoms, were described by
LaCava as ``explicit but accurate.''
   ``It was our feeling that it had to be explicit,'' said LaCava.
``There's no other word for penis.''
   The newspaper staff had showed the articles to White the
previous week, LaCava said, adding he left the meeting feeling that
White was shocked but would still allow them to be published.
   But on Tuesday, ``just before we were going to go to the
printer, Dr. White came in and said we wouldn't be allowed to do
it,'' LaCava said.
   LaCava and his co-editor, 17-year-old M. Liwanag Querijero,
decided to take the proofs to the printer despite White's
objections.
   ``We felt strongly enough to defy him,'' LaCava said.
   Bill Sachs, owner of Fast Copy Printing Center in Keyport, where
the paper is normally printed, said a school official came to the
shop Wednesday and asked him to hand over the proofs. He refused.
   About an hour later, he said, he received a call from the school
board warning that he could lose his contract if he did not turn
over the proofs.
   ``They made it clear I had to turn them over,'' he said.
   White said no disciplinary action is contemplated against LaCava
or Miss Querijero.
   ``I wanted them to proceed at a slower pace and do a series of
articles rather than to broadside the thing and alienate allies
they might have needed later on to make real changes,'' he said.
   The limitations of the sex education courses result from ``a
sort of combination of political and educational decision-making,''
he said. ``Parents think teaching kids about sex will promote
promiscuity. That's a constant theme we battle.''
   But the issue of reforming the curriculum is now solidly on the
front burner, he said. ``I think they've made their point that what
we have is too little, too late.''

   The arctic air that strained power supplies, threatened orange
trees and brought misery to the homeless today delivered an encore
of polar blasts and record low temperatures, and what could be a
white Christmas in Tampa, Fla.
   ``There was supposed to be global warming, but I don't think
anybody's seen it this month,'' weather service forecaster Edward
Yandrich said in New York. ``The greenhouse effect took a hiatus.''
   The coldest dawn on record broke over some U.S. cities but the
``Siberian Express'' that whistled over the pole through the Yukon
and stalled in the Midwest should be jump-started over the weekend
by a warm front trickling over the Rockies.
   Snow was falling or forecast from central Florida to the
Carolinas and west fo Mississippi, but in other areas east of the
Rockies today's lows should be followed by a pre-Christmas respite.
   Wilmington, N.C. had more than 4 inches of snow on the ground
this morning and up to 8 inches was forecast by afternoon, far
surpassing the record for the date. The snow closed the coastal
city's airport.
   In Nebraska, the weekend forecast called for Christmas Day
temperatures in the 40s, seemingly tropical compared with the
40-plus below recorded Friday morning.
   The cold snap has caused at least 67 weather-related deaths
around the country.
   Snow flurries whitened the Florida Panhandle cities of
Pensacola, Tallahassee, Apalachicola, Milton and Crestview early
today, said Brian Maher of the National Weather Service.
   Up to 4 inches of snow were forecast for Jacksonville, where the
all-time record is 2 inches. Southern Florida, which has escaped
the cold until now, was due for a snap, with a freeze forecast
Sunday in Miami.
   ``People are pouring in,'' said Jeanetta Pratt of the City
Rescue Mission in Jacksonville. ``We don't turn anyone away. ... We
will find a place for them.''
   Citrus growers were nervous, jogged by memories of the $3
billion in damages from hard freezes in 1983 and 1985.
   ``The timing is not good. We have a lot of fruit on the trees
and a lot of concerned growers,'' said Dick Whalley of Florida
Citrus Mutual in Lakeland.
   Texas' $30 million citrus industry was also threatened.
   A sheet of ice and up to 2 inches of snow today covered
Georgia's Golden Isles, normally a holiday haven of winter golf
among the palm trees. Officials closed ice-covered causeways,
cutting off three of the islands from the mainland.
   Cold records were snapped in more than 125 cities Friday. A low
of 23 degrees below zero made it the coldest day ever in Kansas
City, Mo.
   At Rochford, high in the black hills of South Dakota, the
unofficial reading was 60 degrees below zero. The weather service's
official low was 47 degrees below zero at Broadus and Hardin, Mont.
   The all-time record low in the United States is 80 below at
Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971. And in New York City,
where it was a brisk 8 Friday morning, a Soviet emigrant said he
wasn't impressed.
   ``This is nothing,'' said Dora Romadinov. ``In Moscow it's much
colder. Look, there's no snow! The sun is out!''
   The rags-and-riches atmosphere of midtown Manhattan took on a
particularly poignant air, with many of the city's 80,000 homeless
people crowding into shelters and train and subway stations to keep
warm, cheek by jowl with well-dressed Christmas shoppers bustling
from boutiques.
   A homeless man in tennis shoes fished for spare coins in a
fountain; across the street families traipsed into Radio City Music
Hall for the Christmas show.
   Outside City Hall, demonstrators erected four tombstones to mark
the deaths of four homeless people who died of exposure while
sleeping in subways last weekend.
   ``These tragic deaths have gone virtually unnoticed, and we more
affluent New Yorkers seem to have let our hearts grow colder and
more hardened than the bitter winter,'' said David Beseda of the
Coalition for the Homeless.
   Around the country thousands were without heat or power because
of outages caused by overdrawn current, ice on the power lines and
other problems. Heating oil shortfalls were reported at terminals
throughout the Northeast.
   At the Southeast Kansas Branch Experiment Station near Parsons,
the cold was making it difficult to keep water for the cattle from
freezing. Luckily none of the cows at the station were about to
give birth.
   ``It would be a rude awakening to come into the world now,''
said station head Lyle Thomas. ``That would be quite a temperature
drop.''
   Records lows Friday included Pittsburgh at 12 below; Tulsa 6
below; Oklahoma City at 4 below; Denver at 18 below, and
Scottsbluff, Neb., at 42 below.
   ``Records are nice, but who the hell wants to stick around when
they're there?'' said George Matuella of the weather service in
Omaha, Neb.

<HEAD>Owner Convicted of Manslaughter in Pit Bull Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury found a man guilty of involuntary
manslaughter in his pit bull's killing of a 2-year-old boy in what
the prosecutor said was the first such case.
   The Santa Clara County Superior Court jury on Friday acquitted
Michael Berry, 39, of second-degree murder after a day and a half
of deliberations. Berry had been the first pet owner in the country
charged with murder because of an animal's actions, according to
Deputy District Attorney Dale Sanderson and the Humane Society of
the United States.
   Berry, who could have faced 15 years in prison if convicted of
the murder charge, was also found guilty of owning a mischievous
animal, cultivating marijuana, and keeping a fighting dog.
   Judge James Flaherty set a January sentencing date. Berry could
be sentenced to up to 4 years and 8 months in jail.
   Sanderson told reporters he was satisfied with the verdicts and
that ``I'm glad we ran with the murder charge.''
   Berry was charged in connection with the June 13, 1987, death of
James Soto, his neighbor, who wandered into the Berry yard and was
mauled to death by Berry's 4-year-old pit bull, Willy.
   The dog, which was kept in a locked cell during the trial, was
not as lucky as his master. Willy, according to the county Humane
Society, was to be killed, and was kept alive during the trial only
because he was ``evidence.''
   Berry claimed during the trial that the dead boy's parents
shared blame for the fact that the boy was allowed to get near the
pit bull, which was tethered to a stake in the yard.
   ``What we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for
aggressiveness and to be a combatant,'' Sanderson said during
Berry's arraignment. ``And, knowing the dog's propensity, he places
him in an area accessible to all, including children.''
   Sanderson acknowledged that there was no evidence of any actual
malice by Berry or intent by him to kill the Soto boy, but said the
prosecution was based on a theory of implied malice. That, he said,
allowed a murder conviction against someone whose actions showed
wanton disregard for human life.
   The state Court of Appeal agreed that Berry could be tried for
murder.
   During a search of Berry's home, authorities said they found
several publications on illegal dog fighting, and a dog-sized
treadmill.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Berliners poured through
new Berlin Wall border crossings at the Brandenburg Gate today for
a final, frantic day of Christmas shopping in the well-stocked
stores of the West.
   Other Berliners headed for home after singing and dancing late
into the night at the newly opened gate, which has been transformed
from a symbol of Germany's divisions into one of East-West
rapprochement.
   Although visa-free travel for West Germans to East Germany
technically does not take effect until Sunday, there were few
formalities at the Brandenburg Gate, opened only Friday, for those
who headed East today.
   Throughout the night Friday, a steady clink of metal against
stone accompanied the merrymakers as hundreds of souvenir seekers
chipped away at the Berlin Wall near the gate in the 28-year-old
Berlin Wall.
   At other crossing points, East German shoppers laden with
purchases from West Berlin carried Christmas presents, cases of
beer and bags of oranges.
   West German television periodically carried live coverage of the
festivities Friday night, showing the crowd dancing on top of the
wall, popping champagne corks and waving sparklers.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans
Modrow met Friday for the second time in a week at a ceremony
formally opening two border crossings in the wall just north and
south of the towering gate.
   Security collapsed as soon as the two crossings were opened.
Thousands of people pushed down metal barriers erected to control
the crowd and swept through the vast Paris square, snaking through
the gate and climbing the wall.
   West Berlin police estimated that more than 30,000 people had
gathered on the Western side for the ceremony. The crowd on the
Eastern side appeared to be much larger, but there were no official
estimates.
   Although more than 20 border crossings have been cut through the
Berlin Wall since East Germany opened its borders to the West on
Nov. 9, the opening of the Brandenburg Gate was the emotional
climax of the rapid merger of the people divided since the end of
World War II.
   The openings resulted from a popular uprising in East Germany
that drove out its hard-line Communist leaders.
   When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Brandenburg Gate,
Berlin's most famous landmark that straddled a main prewar
thoroughfare, remained in the East. It was also inaccessible to
East Berliners until Friday because it was part of the off-limit
East German border zone.
   The crowd carried Berlin, West German and East German flags. One
large sign saying in English ``Come Together'' was held aloft by
several people who climbed atop the wall.
   The thick section of the wall directly in front of the gate
remains, but hundreds climbed on top to dance and hug in joyful
scenes reminiscent of the time when the borders were first opened
in November.
   Kohl said the opening of the gate was a ``fantastic thing.''
   He and Modrow met Friday afternoon on the border line, shook
hands and then walked together to a platform to address the crowd.
   The two leaders were nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd as
security officials tried in vain to establish some control.
   The ceremony was broadcast live on both countries' national
television.
   ``This is where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator
for West Germany's ZDF network.
   Modrow reminded the crowd of the role the gate has played in
German history, then said its new function should be ``to serve the
peace.''
   Kohl said, ``This is the happiest day in my life, because I feel
that here in Berlin I am standing in the middle of Germany.''
   ``We need the sympathy, the support and the approval of our
neighbors'' as the two Germanys move closer together, he said. ``We
want peace and freedom.''
   The speeches were drowned out by the noisy crowd. Many people
had tears in their eyes as they mingled together.
   ``Berlin, have fun now,'' West Berlin mayor Walter Momper told
the crowd.

   An Air Force plane bombed a
resistance position today, and the U.S. military reportedly decided
to reinforce its troops after its headquarters were attacked by
forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Anarchy ruled the streets, and residents set up vigilante squads
to protect homes and businesses from looters and from the
paramilitary ``Dignity Battalions'' loyal to Noriega.
   The U.S. plane repeatedly bombed a hilltop position at 4 a.m. in
the working-class district of San Miguelito, site of the Panamanian
military garrison of Tinajitas. Witnesses said the bombing run
lasted about five minutes, and the plane apparently did not draw
ground fire.
   An observation plane and a helicopter conducted lengthy patrols
over the area before the raid.
   Civilians manned street barricades overnight to prevent the
Dignity Battalions from sacking homes and stealing cars. In some
areas Friday, the paramilitaries went door to door to demand car
keys and loot homes.
   U.S. troops moved into the port city of Colon on Friday to quell
widespread looting, and 200 members of the Defense Forces
surrendered, Lt. Col. Johnny Brooks, told a group of Pentagon pool
repoorters.
   He said the soldiers fought a small group of snipers but that no
Americans were wounded.
   A local businessman, Esteban Jimenez, told reporters that 55
people had been killed in the days of looting.
   Brooks said that in one case troops shot the tires of a forklift
to prevent it from carrying a luxury automobile down the street.
``Have you ever seen a BMW on a forklift?'' he said.
   Leopold Benedetti, a former mayor of the city, said residents
needed medical supplies. The U.S. invasion began midnight Tuesday.
   Members of the Dignity Battalions fired at the car of the
U.S.-installed first vice president, Ricardo Arias Calderon, as he
left the National Assembly on Friday. He was not hurt, but two
aides were wounded, another aide said.
   The Red Cross appealed for food for thousands of refugees of the
fighting and hospitals were short of medical supplies.
   Rumors were rife about Noriega's whereabouts but the general who
stubbornly resisted two years of U.S. political and economic
pressure remained elusive.
   The Bush administration said it launched ``Operation Just
Cause'' to bring him to the United States to face federal drug
trafficking charges, restore democracy and protect the 35,000
Americans living in the country.
   The government that was sworn in Tuesday night requires U.S.
protection and has no police or army to back it, indicating it may
be some time before a working democracy is built in Panama.
   The Dignity Battalions, joined by an unknown number of Noriega's
once 15,000-strong Defense Forces, were putting up a tougher battle
than U.S. officials anticipated.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
he was ``surprised'' by the strength of the remaining Noriega
forces. The fighting is ``a little bit greater than I expected at
the onset.'
   He said the estimated 1,800 members of the Dignity Battalions
had broken up into groups of 10 to 12.
   ``It is organized, clearly organized,'' he said.
   A Pentagon source said Friday night that 2,000 more U.S.
soldiers would be flown to Panama to augment the 24,000 already in
the country. The stiff Panamanian resistance was extending an
operation originally planned for three days. Military officials in
Washington said it would take 10 more days.
   On Friday, Noriega loyalists attacked Quarry Heights, the
Southern Command headquarters on the western edge of Panama City,
for an hour at midday.
   Mortars thundered from the railroad tracks below, shaking the
hillside building as they struck the ground nearby. Helicopters and
machine gunfire chattered overhead.
   About a dozen fighters attacked U.S. soldiers occupying
Panamanian secret police headquarters by the railroad below and
gunfire hit a warehouse and other buildings near the Panama Canal
Commission headquarters a few blocks away.
   There were no reports on casualties.
   In the first three days of fighting, 21 American soldiers and
127 Panamanian soldiers were killed, the Pentagon said. It reported
221 Americans and 66 Panamanians wounded, and two American soldiers
and one civilian missing. Two civilian U.S. dependents were killed
and 1,663 Panamanians detained.
   But Dr. Elmer Miranda, deputy director of Santo Tomas Hospital
in Panama City, said there were 200 bodies there. He said a
colleague said there were 60 more in Gorgas Hospital, run by the
U.S. Southern Command.
   The Supreme Court, about a mile to the southeast, was set ablaze
Friday and planes made occasional bombing runs on San Miguelito, a
center of resistance.
   Sporadic gunfire continued into the night.
   American troops seized 10,000 weapons in three separate caches
in Panama City, primarily East bloc weapons. Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly,
director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the
discovery ``little short of astonishing.''
   He said U.S. forces have made some progress, such as taking the
legislative building, the presidential palace, central bank, and
several ministries.
   Military intelligence officers pored over papers from Noriega's
offices but said they found few clues as to the general's
whereabouts.
   Glass, trash and toppled light poles littered the streets of
Panama City, a flourishing international banking center just two
years ago. Columns of smoke darkened the sky where gunfire and
mortar attacks were launched.
   Thousands of people of all ages and incomes looted supermarkets,
department stores and boutiques.
   Snipers were reported in many areas of the city. Gunshots, many
of them fired by shopowners and private armed guards trying to
prevent looting, rang through virtually every neighborhood.
   With no police protection, residents took the law into their own
hands.
   Many Panamanians were too frightened to come out of their homes.
   Latin American countries have protested the intervention, with
Peru acting most decisevly on its objections by suspending joint
anti-drug operations with U.S. agents in the Huallaga Valley, a
major cocaine producing region.
   President Alan Garcia said Thursday that he would not attend a
Feb. 15 drug summit with President Bush and leaders of Colombia and
Bolivia.

   The invasion of Panama made targets
of U.S. citizens and the Marriott Hotel became a choice hunting
ground for supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Minutes after U.S. troops attacked the Panamanian Defense
Forces, a squad of men with ski masks and assault rifles began
prowling the hotel.
   By the time paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division arrived
24 hours later, more than a dozen guests had been kidnapped and
others had become hostages to fear.
   I found myself taken hostage, hunted, held incommunicado,
looking down more gun barrels than I care to count, rescued and
evacuated.
   These words began it: ``The United States is invading. We're
looking for American hostages.''
   The speaker was the squad leader, and he had come to the right
place. The Marriott, Panama City's most comfortable hotel, was host
to a corps of journalists and the usual complement of foreign
travelers.
   He and his cohorts settled on a dozen of us. Seven turned out to
be U.S. citizens.
   We tried to persuade them to tell their side of the story _ the
point of view of those being invaded and attacked. We went in
search of a telephone so we could call The Associated Press, but he
and his men had knocked out the phones.
   But we had made a personal contact that might, just might, make
it harder for him to kill us.
   We were taken to a private home in Noriega's neighborhood.
   It was not so bad. We were not blindfolded, beaten, verbally
abused or tied up. Our captors gave us water and returned borrowed
items like pens or cigarette lighters with courtesy.
   Always present, however, was the very real possibility that our
situation would turn suddenly worse.
   At one point, a kidnapper put the barrel of his AK-47 assault
rifle to the head of The New York Times correspondent Lindsey
Gruson.
   ``A lot of Panamanians have died. We can kill you,'' he said.
``Don't think we won't.''
   At another point, when I turned to console a captive who was
weeping, another kidnapper leveled his assault rifle at me, inches
from my nose, and held it there for what seemed like two or three
lifetimes.
   Around 4 a.m., nearly four hours after we were taken hostage,
the sounds of fighting outside diminished. The phone rang.
   ``It's over,'' the squad leader said. ``We don't want to dirty
ourselves. We are going to let you go.''
   He crouched in front of us, tears in his eyes. ``There are
hundreds of dead at the central barracks,'' the Defense Forces
headquarters, he said. ``Hundreds of dead.''
   We were put into two vehicles and freed at different locations.
I, Gruson, Paul Iredale of the Reuters news agency and three
businessmen were dropped on a curbside two blocks from Noriega's
mansion.
   Fighting continued in the streets and we hunkered at a hedge,
trying to devise a strategy for getting back to the hotel, more
than a mile away. Someone shot at us from a gas station across the
street.
   We dashed around the hedge to an apartment building and began
ringing every bell. A frightened doorman appeared and waved us away
with a pistol. We continued ringing buzzers and someone inside
decided to open the door.
   A brave family let me into their apartment. I was in heaven. No
one was pointing a gun at me and the lady of the house made coffee.
There was a view of the main battle area _ the Defense Forces
headquarters several miles away _ and I was able to report by
telephone to our office.
   As we drove back to the hotel I felt terrific: alive, unharmed
and free at last to report Panama's dramatic story.
   The next thing I knew, a gang of civilian Noriega supporters,
from the ``Dignity Battalions,'' raided the hotel. I looked down
from my 10th floor window to see three hostages face down in the
back of a Toyota pickup truck full of armed men.
   There was no way out. Trying to walk away seemed foolhardy while
gangs of thugs were scouting for American hostages. Gruson and I
barricaded ourselves in my room. I called the U.S. Embassy and my
office in New York to explain the situation.
   The hotel was totally unprotected. There were 30 or more U.S.
citizens. The Dignity Battalions had said they would come back.
   They didn't, but that did not mean we were relaxed. At about 4
p.m., 12 hours after I'd been freed the first time, some hotel
workers came to the room.
   ``The Marines will be here in about two minutes,'' they said.
``Hurry.''
   We went down the hall to a room where an Eastern Air Lines
pilot, Jay Skinner, his crew of seven and about 20 other Americans
were waiting. Skinner was on the telephone to an Eastern crisis
center in Miami.
   As it turned out, I was a hostage again, this time of the
terrified Eastern crew.
   Time passed and it was clear no rescue was imminent, but Skinner
and the crew refused to let us use the telephone or leave the room,
saying it would jeopardize their safety to have Americans elsewhere
in the hotel.
   ``If they capture you and torture you, you will tell them where
we are,'' a flight attendant said.
   Fear had overcome them during hours they spent in the hotel
laundry, where some had tried to disguise themselves as bellboys or
chefs.
   A flight instructor screamed at me and shoved me against the
wall when I tried to explain why I wanted to make a telephone call.
Our offices in Mexico City and New York were worried.
   Gruson and I got out after four hours, when food was brought to
an adjoining room. We dashed into the room, grabbed the telephone
and called our offices.
   Skinner's call to his crisis center finally paid off about at 11
p.m. with the arrival of 90 paratroopers from Bravo Company, 2nd
Batallion, 405th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division.
   The soldiers handed out soft drinks, cookies and fruit from the
hotel kitchen, checked to see if anyone needed medical care, found
blankets and pillows and got everyone settled.
   ``They gotta go through us to get to you and they can't do
that,'' an officer said.
   After more than 24 hours in combat, the men of Battlin' Bravo
exhibited such a degree of courage, kindness and courtesy that I
decided to call on them every time I needed saving.
   Next morning's evacuation was fast and frantic. A sniper had
shot one of the soldiers minutes before. The paratroopers piled 110
guests and hotel workers into two Marriott airport food service
trucks and we barreled down the road to the ruins of an old fort
about three miles away.
   Several hours later, a Chinook troop transport helicopter landed
on the nearby beach in a cloud of green smoke from a marker
grenade. We hustled aboard and flew to Howard Air Force Base, about
eight minutes away.
   Finally I was free. Really free. And I savored it like a
spoonful of caviar.
   My exhilaration faded as I saw what the fighting and looting had
done to the city. I saw gutted stores, shattered glass, smoldering
ruins, streets awash in garbage where armed bands roamed at will.
   The story had just begun.

   Israeli paratroopers closed
stores and ordered Bethlehem holiday shoppers home today after a
clash with masked youths near the traditional site of the birth of
Christ.
   In another development, visiting South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu bowed his head in silent prayer at a memorial to slain
Palestinians and told Arab religious leaders and activists: ``We
support your struggle for ... statehood and independence.''
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, three Palestinian youths were
wounded by gunshots in clashes with troops, Arab hospital officials
said.
   In Bethlehem, masked youths burned tires and hurled stones at
army patrols across from the Church of the Nativity. The site marks
the manger where tradition holds Jesus was born.
   Troops dispersed the stonethrowers by shooting in the air and
firing tear gas into the narrow alleyways of the nearby
marketplace, where the youths fled.
   Paratroopers and purple-bereted troops from the elite Givati
brigade ran through the marketplace shouting ``Ruhi el-beit,''
Arabic for go home, to holiday shoppers and demanded that local
youths use brooms to sweep the streets clean of debris from the
burning tires.
   One enraged woman shopper turned to a soldier and said: ``You
can't close the shops, this is our holiday,'' but the soldier
ordered her home.
   Slogans were seen throughout the town calling for increased
clashes with troops to mark the holiday.
   ``Let's escalate against the Zionists on Christmas Day,'' was
spray-painted in black on one stone wall. It was signed by the
clandestine underground leadership of the uprising.
   The underground leadership had ordered merchants to stay open
until 5 p.m. and not close at noon to mark a Palestinian strike
that has been in force since the start of the uprising against
Israeli occupation two-years ago.
   At least 637 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians since the Palestinian revolt began. Forty-three Israelis
also have died in the violence and Palestinians have slain 161 of
their fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   Also today, the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement canceled a
Christmas Day strike after protests from Palestinian Christians and
resheduled the work stoppage for Dec. 27.
   On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a site regarded as holy to both
Jews and Moslems, Tutu joined Moslem religious leaders and
Palestinian activists including leading PLO-supporter Feisal
Husseini in a moment of prayer at a stone memorial for slain
Palestinians.
   The stone prayer platform was built in memory of the more than
600 Palestinians killed by Israeli-supported Christian militiamen
in 1982 at the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps near Beirut.
   ``We support the struggle of the Palestinian people in their
longing for statehood and independence,'' Tutu told the gathering
of about 30 Palestinian dignitaries. ``We are struggling for our
own self-determination in South Africa.''
   ``We pray that the day will come soon when a Palestinian state
will exist side by side with a Jewish state and Arab and Jew will
hold hands together,'' said Tutu, who arrived Friday on a five-day
pilgrimage.

   The Soviet Union today sent medical supplies to
Romania and appealed to its Warsaw Pact allies to help support the
uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu, but it appeared to rule out
military intervention.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said wounded Romanians likely will
be flown to the Soviet Union for treatment, and it warned that the
fighting in Bucharest had endangered the lives of Soviets living in
the Romanian capital.
   ``The first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have
already arrived in Bucharest,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said. ``But they still are being held up in the Bucharest airport,
which is blockaded.''
   Tass said Gorbachev told the Soviet Parliament that the Soviet
government ``had decided to appeal to the governments of the Warsaw
Pact states with the aim of coordinated efforts in providing
support to the people of Romania.''
   The Soviet Red Cross, Ministry of Health and other organizations
were working with similar organizations in France and Eastern
Europe to provide medicine and specialists, he said.
   Gorbachev said ``a number of other measures'' were being worked
out with Warsaw Pact allies, and that a special working group was
monitoring events in Romania. He provided no other details.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov dismissed talk of sending Soviet
troops to Romania to aid the provisional Romanian government that,
backed by the army, declared itself in control after Ceausescu fled
Bucharest on Friday.
   ``We have to support them from the point of view of medical help
and maybe some other kinds of help, but to bring in forces, I think
that's impermissible,'' Ryzhkov said.
   ``We mustn't repeat mistakes,'' the head of the Soviet
government told reporters. ``Not long ago, we re-evaluated the
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. That
reconsideration was made on Dec. 4, and should we repeat something
like that a few days later?''
   Romanian TV, in the hands of the rebels, said earlier today that
the Soviet Embassy had pledged to send personnel and equipment to
aid the uprising.
   The announcement followed an appeal broadcast by the television
from an unidentified army general who urged Moscow to step in
because ``terrorist units'' loyal to Ceausescu had sent
reinforcements to the capital.
   Gorbachev indicated his country was just as confused as the rest
of the world about the whereabouts of Ceausescu, who had ruled the
allied country of 23 million people for nearly a quarter century.
   Tass said the fighting had put Soviet trade officials and their
families living in Bucharest in ``serious danger.
   ``The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the fate of
Soviet citizens and demands that those who have unleashed the above
actions, endangering the life of the Soviet people, should
immediately stop them,'' Tass said.
   On Friday, the Soviet Parliament passed a resolution offering
``decisive support for the just cause of the people of Romania.''
   Hundreds of people were killed in clashes in Bucharest between
the army and police forces that included Ceausescu's personal
anti-terrorist squad.
   Soviet media have aggressively covered the uprising in Romania,
providing readers and listeners with startling details of the
battle for power.
   Correspondents of the official Tass news agency have provided
vivid eyewitness accounts of the battle between army units
supporting the uprising and guard units loyal to Ceausescu.
   Official television on Friday night showed film of hundreds of
thousands of Romanians packed into the squares of downtown
Bucharest.
   Gorbachev has given his blessing to the political reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe, where one after another old-style
Communist regimes have fallen this year to the forces of democracy.
   While Ceausescu's Romania remained a part of the Soviet bloc,
relations between Gorbachev and Ceausescu were notably cool.
   They last met early in December in Moscow, when Tass described
their meeting in terms that left little doubt about their sharp
disagreements.

   Striking miners and the Pittston Co. are
hoping to reach a pre-Christmas agreement on a contract that would
end a nearly nine-month strike.
   Talks between the United Mine Workers and Pittston resumed at
midmorning today after breaking off shortly after midnight as the
two sides sought to meet a mediator's hope that the bitter and
sometimes violent strike be settled by Christmas.
   Principals in the talks did not speak to reporters because of a
gag order, but sources said considerable progress was made Thursday
and Friday. Still, an agreement has proved elusive because of
outstanding disputes.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, hoping an agreement was near,
delayed plans to travel to her native North Carolina for Christmas
and remained in Washington so she could participate if a settlement
is announced. It was Dole who named the supermediator for the talks.
   The two sides began around-the-clock negotiations early this
week, and word that a settlement might be imminent surfaced at
mid-week as UMW President Richard Trumka and Pittston Chairman Paul
Douglas were called into the talks.
   Mediator W.J. Usery pledged to seek a settlement by Christmas
that would allow the nearly 1,700 miners from Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky to return to work after the traditional
holiday shutdown of the mines.
   Although the strike involves just 1,700 miners, it holds broad
implications for the UMW and the mining industry as a whole. The
dispute between the miners and Pittston over retiree health
benefits threatens to undermine a decades-old compact between
mining companies and the UMW guaranteeing retired miners full
health benefits.
   Pittston last year refused to participate in the compact, the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association agreement, because it
objected to the new funding formula. Pittston was unable to reach
agreement with the miners on an alternate plan and had stopped
payments into union pension and medical funds.
   Usery, a former labor secretary and veteran mediator, was tapped
as supermediator by Mrs. Dole in late October, shortly after she
visited with Pittston strikers in the Virginia coal fields.
   The dispute over funding the retirement plans led the miners to
strike April 5 after 17 months of failed contract talks with
Pittston's mining subsidiary, Pittston Coal Group. The miners had
worked for 14 months without a contract when they struck.
   The union has paid the strikers about $200 a week in benefits
and is facing fines totaling $63.5 million for violating court
orders limiting picketing and other strike activities. Last week
the union said it would give each striker a $1,250 Christmas bonus,
sweetening a prior offer to give them interest-free loans.
   Pittston hired replacements to operate the mines but production
has been well below pre-strike levels, and industry analysts said
it appeared the company has been forced to buy coal to keep up with
its supply commitments.
   Pittston reported that its coal operations lost $3.6 million in
the second quarter of 1989 and $9.8 million in the third, compared
to profits of $9 million and $7.4 million in the respective
quarters of 1988.

   Grieving relatives flew to the northern
coastal town of Kempsey on Saturday to identify the 36 victims of
Australia's worst highway accident.
   Friday's head-on collision between two buses left 39 people
injured, some trapped in wreckage for hours, and led to renewed
calls to reduce the speed limit for buses and trucks from 68 mph to
56 mph.
   The cause of the crash was not known but newspaper reports
suggested one bus veered into the oncoming lane of the two-way
highway linking the cities of Sydney and Brisbane.
   Ten people were still hospitalized, and critically hurt were
airlifted to Sydney, 280 miles south, Kempsey Hospital official
Michael Doyle said.
   At least three foreign tourists were among the victims. Police
said they came from the United States, New Zealand and Britain but
their identities and hometowns were witheld pending identification
and notification of relatives.

   Rebel soldiers appeared the take
control of Timisoara on Saturday and residents armed with knives
and sharpened sticks roamed the streets of the city, the cradle of
Romania's revolution.
   Medical personnel reported at least two people killed and six
wounded from midnight Friday to midmorning Saturday in fighting
between the army and holdout units of Securitate, the feared
special police force of deposed leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Scattered gunfire continued in Timisoara, the nation's
fourth-largest city.
   At the military hospital, doctors spent the night anxiously
listening to the crackle of automatic machine-gun fire and barrages
from tanks. The sound of gunfire surrounded the building, but the
shooters were not seen.
   ``They are here, they are there, they are somewhere in the park.
We don't know where they are, and that's why it's so frightening,''
said a doctor.
   The physician said she had been working without letup since Dec.
17, when police and army units machine-gunned thousands of
civilians.
   Two days earlier, a brutal police crackdown on Timisoara
pro-democracy demonstrators sparked protests that spread across the
nation, leading to Friday's revolt against Ceausescu by citizens
and sympathetic army soldiers.
   Romanian radio said more than 12,000 people had been killed in
Timisoara alone since the uprising began. As in other Soviet bloc
countries seeking reform, the protesters sought an end to
dictatorial one-party rule.
   Among the dead were 7,614 people detained by pro-Ceausescu units
and executed, said the report, which like others was impossible to
verify.
   Tearful residents on Friday congregated at freshly unearthed
mass graves believed to contain the bodies of thousands of
summarily executed victims _ some mutilated.
   The streets on Saturday appeared to be controlled by bands of
citizens wearing armbands of the national colors of blue, yellow
and red. They were armed only with knives, clubs and sharpened
sticks. Open trucks carrying army troops were a frequent sight.
   Buildings were decorated with Romanian flags with their
communist coat-of-arms cut out and with pictures of Ceausescu
behind bars.
   A wounded man undergoing surgery for a bullet hole in his leg
asked for military aid for the anti-Ceausescu rebels.
   ``We need guns and airplanes, all fighting for us and not
against us,'' he said through a translator.
   ``Send Rambo,'' he said grimacing as the surgeon explored his
wound.
   Another victim was a 33-year-old doctor whose leg was shattered
by a bullet as he was coming toward the hospital. It appeared he
would lose his leg.
   ``You come to the hospital to help people, and here I am as a
patient,'' he said.
   He and other Romanians asked a Western reporter for anonymity,
in a reflection of the widespread anxiety that the revolution could
be squelched and repression could return.

   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu had already
fled a popular uprising at home when thousands of miles away in
China, television still carried his last speech as if nothing had
happened.
   Ceausescu's sudden fall from power clearly took Chinese
officials by surprise. The Foreign Ministry took more than 24 hours
to issue a substantive comment, and then said simply that it was
following developments with interest and hoped to continue friendly
relations with Romania.
   His fall also left Chinese leaders more isolated than ever in
their rejection of democratic reforms that have swept the socialist
world this year. But it was unlikely to shake their resolve to keep
political power firmly in the hands of the Communist Party.
   Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, speaking to Hong Kong
publishers Thursday, implied that East European armies lacked
strength to put down the uprisings. China's army, by contrast,
underwent ``the test of lengthy revolutionary warfare'' and
maintained strict political discipline, he said.
   As one Communist Party after another has been forced to share
power in Eastern Europe, Jiang and other Chinese leaders have
insisted that China's vast population and backward economy make
socialism the only viable system.
   In internal discussions, according to the Hong Kong Economic
Daily, they concluded that East Europe's example only proves the
correctness of China's decision to use force against pro-democracy
protesters in June.
   Individual Chinese who heard foreign radio broadcasts of
Ceausescu's fall applauded it but saw no hope that senior leader
Deng Xiaoping would be the next aging autocrat to go. ``We don't
want violence,'' said one, noting the heavy fighting and death toll
in Romania. Given China's size, he said, the bloodshed would be
even greater.
   In the end, China was reserved in its support for Ceausescu.
   ``We ... believe that it's Romania's internal affair,'' the
Foreign Ministry said repeatedly as the protests swelled last week.
   Asked Saturday if China would give Ceausescu a safe haven, the
ministry said only that he had not come nor asked to. It refused to
say what it would do if he did ask.
   Ceausescu had been one of China's most reliable friends abroad.
In the 1960s, when the Soviet Union broke with China and took with
it most of Eastern Europe, Ceausescu refused to take sides and
maintained good relations with Beijing.
   When much of the world condemned China's crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters, he applauded it and sent several
government and party delegations to Beijing. Qiao Shi, a top
Chinese party official, returned the visits in November.
   Ceausescu was quoted frequently by China's media, with his
denunciations of Western imperialism closely matching those of Deng
and Jiang. Chinese papers withheld reports on the violence in
Romania until it became clear he could not return to power.
   A photo exhibit celebrating Chinese-Romanian friendship opened
with fanfare in a Beijing park just one day before Ceausescu's
ouster.
   But Friday, as he fled by helicopter from his palace roof, the
exhibit was deserted and locked. A visitor who rattled the door
roused two surprised attendants.

<TEXT>
   Albania's state news agency on Saturday
issued an unusually frank report on the Romanian revolt against
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, whose regime had much in common with
the Albanian leadership.
   With the ouster of Ceausescu, Albania remains the last stalwart
of Stalinism in Eastern Europe.
   But ATA's reporting indicated the present Tirana leadership was
at least not opposed to Ceausescu's reported ouster.
   Romania was the last member of the Soviet alliance to be hit
with the wave of reform. Earlier this year, Poland, Hungary,
Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia each embraced liberal
change.
   The other two Eastern European nations, Albania and Yugoslavia,
are non-aligned nations.
   Yugoslavia broke with Moscow in 1948 because its founder, the
late Jozip Broz Tito, espoused a less harsh brand of Communism than
Stalin. Albania broke with the Kremlin in 1961 to continue its
orthodox Stalinist course.
   Long-time leader Enver Hoxha led his country into increasing
isolation, and the nation of 3 million became one of the most
closed societies in the world.
   Under Ramiz Alia, who took over after Hoxha's death in 1985, the
country renewed diplomatic relations with dozens of countries and
opened up somewhat to tourism, but Alia has continued to abhor the
reforms in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries.
   The ATA report quoted Western and Soviet bloc news agencies in
its dispatch and noted that the Soviet news agency Tass had been
unusually vivid in its reporting of the Romanian situation.
   The dispatch could indicate a further opening in the poorest
nation in Europe.
   The news agency has not issued any editorial comment on the
situation in Romania.
   ATA has on previous occasions quoted Western and other foreign
news agencies but usually only in connection with the situation in
neighboring Yugoslavia, where there is a large ethnic Albanian
population.

   When the Atallah family opened its shop selling
silver crucifixes and painted icons in Jerusalem's Old City four
decades ago, almost all the neighboring stores were owned by fellow
Arab Christians.
   Today, only 20 of the 200 shops that line Christian Quarter Road
remain in Christian hands, says George Atallah, who is Greek
Orthodox.
   ``The churches of Jerusalem could become museums if people keep
leaving,'' Atallah warned.
   A worrisome stream of emigration to the West has steadily
increased, encouraged by a rise in Moslem fundamentalism and the
pressures of the two-year Palestinian uprising.
   The uprising has caught the Christians in the middle. As
Palestinians, they are part of the anti-Israeli revolt. Their
children throw stones and are shot by soldiers. They suffer
economic hardship alongside the Moslems.
   But as the rebellion drags on without real gains, Islamic
fundamentalism is strengthening and Christian hopes for a secular
Palestinian state are fading.
   ``Christians wonder what they are going to do here if Islamic
forces continue to gain power,'' said Geries Khoury, director of a
Christian Palestinian research center near Bethlehem. ``Every day
people are losing hope.''
   The Christian community is particularly outraged at this week's
call by the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement for a general
strike on Christmas Day, and Christian leaders say it will not
block religious observance of the holiday.
   More than 30 Christian denominations have followers in the Holy
Land, led by the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic and Roman Catholic
churches.
   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, the first Arab to serve as the Roman
Catholic bishop of Jerusalem, believes the diverse Christian
community needs special nurturing to prosper.
   ``To be a Christian in this Holy Land is a special vocation,''
he said in an interview. ``It is a difficult life because of the
nature of the land _ always a land of wars, a land of hostility, a
land of minorities and majorities.''
   The Arab Christians, many descendants of the first followers of
Christ, have been a troubled minority in the Holy Land since the
Moslem conquest in the 7th century.
   In recent decades the Christians have been further overwhelmed
by Jewish immigration and the Moslems' high birthrate.
   Israeli experts estimate that in 1947, there were about 650,000
Jews, 1.1 million Moslems and 150,000 Christians in
British-mandatory Palestine.
   Since the founding of the Jewish state in 1948, the Jewish
population has increased nearly six-fold, and the Moslems have more
than doubled. But the Christian community, numbering just 140,000
in Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is smaller
than it was four decades ago, government statistics show.
   Palestinian leaders insist the number is even lower, noting
traditionally Christian towns like Bethlehem and Ramallah now have
Moslem majorities. In Jerusalem, many Christians retain their
property but live abroad.
   An official of Israel's Ministry of Religious Affairs said the
government's policy is to protect and encourage the Christians.
   ``The West was always very interested in the fate of the
Christians,'' he said. ``Israel wanted good relations with the
West, with the Christian world, so it was in our own interest to
watch out for the Christians.''
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, blamed the Christians'
increasing minority status on a low birthrate and the ``mixed
blessing'' of ties to Western churches that anger fundamentalists.
   The Palestinian uprising has heightened the Christians' problems.
   Many Christians, well-educated in church schools and often from
prosperous merchant families, found the deteriorating economy too
much to bear, says George Shamas, a Syrian Orthodox writer who has
immigrated to the United States.
   ``Job opportunities are not available,'' Shamas said. ``Life is
more difficult, and people don't want to be stopped by soldiers and
searched and jailed day in and day out.''
   Still, many Christians take seriously their longstanding role as
leaders of Arab nationalism. The Christian town of Beit Sahour has
been an example, carrying out a much publicized tax revolt and
boycott of Israeli-made products.
   But Joseph, a Beit Sahour Christian who has been jailed several
times in the uprising, worries that Moslem Palestinians do not
appreciate the Christian contribution.
   ``There are efforts by some Islamic groups to exclude us, or
maybe to limit our role in the uprising,'' he said, asking that his
last name not be used.
   He added: ``You hear that Christians are going to be equal to
the Moslems if independence comes in the future, but I am sure that
in reality it will not be the case.''
   Islamic fundamentalism also is growing among Israeli Arabs, fed
by what Moslems feel is discrimination by the Jewish state.
Municipal elections last year gave big gains to fundamentalist
candidates.
   Christian Arabs in Israel have responded by forming a ``union of
churches'' in the coastal town of Haifa and the northern Galilee to
protect their position.
   Khoury, the Christian researcher, says Christians in the
occupied territories also must ensure their place in a future
Palestinian state. He calls on churches to play an active role in
the uprising, as Moslem mosques do.
   ``I am not seeking a Christian solution,'' Khoury insists. ``I
am seeking a Palestinian solution that includes Christians.''

   Soldiers wounded in Panama kept a close watch
on events unfolding there and said they wanted to be back fighting
instead of spending Christmas in military hospitals.
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono visited with the wounded men
Friday. He handed out 200 military decorations and told the men
President Bush was proud of what they had done.
   ``He wanted me to tell you and every other troop down here how
proud he is of each and every one of you for your sacrifice,''
Vuono said.
   More than 170 soldiers were being treated today at Wilford Hall
Medical Center and Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio military
hospitals. A sixth transport plane carrying 18 wounded arrived
about 2 a.m. today, said Kelly Air Force Base spokesman Frank
Weatherly.
   Some soldiers treated in San Antonio were flown Friday to bases
in Georgia and North Carolina. Fifty soldiers have been transferred
to other military hospitals or released back to their units.
   Alexis Pinero, 24, stationed in Fort Bragg, N.C., said Friday
that despite his injury _ a broken foot suffered during a paratroop
jump _ he and his buddies recovering from an assortment of wounds
wanted to return to Panama.
   ``Everybody on our ward would go back, it's a consensus,'' said
Pinero, of Raleigh, N.C., hospitalized at Brooke Army Medical
Center.
   ``I'm doing pretty good now. They're taking pretty good care of
us,'' said Pvt. Richard Turner Jr., 19, of DeSoto, Texas, who
suffered a concussion when a sniper's bullet grazed his helmet.
   Turner and the other servicemen in his ward have been constantly
watching television news reports about the fighting in Panama, said
his mother, Linda Turner _ except for a brief respite.
   ``Well, they watched a little smut thing on Showtime the other
night,'' she conceded.
   At Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, 37 soldiers hurt in
Panama arrived from San Antonio late Friday. Three soliders were
seriously wounded, said Maj. Doug Foster, a spokesman at Fort Bragg.
   ``All were in good spirits when they arrived,'' he said. ``Most
of the soldiers are being treated for fragment wounds or small arm
wounds.''
   Other soldiers and their families were making plans to remain in
San Antonio through Christmas.
   Lee Olivera of Cincinnati, Ohio, visited his brother, Staff Sgt.
Louis Olivera, a 25-year-old who suffered bullet wounds to the
chest and head. The soldier's parents also were on the way to spend
Christmas with him.
   ``He did say that he wanted to go back _ I don't think that's
possible,'' the soldier's brother said.
   Air Force Capt. Peter Debusmann, commander of a C-141 transport
plane that brought 21 injured servicemen to Kelly Air Force Base,
said the soldiers aboard were in good spirits.
   ``They're just glad to be coming home, back to the States, and
home for Christmas. And they're worried that their parents are
worried about them,'' Debusmann said.
   As of today, 93 soldiers were being treated at Wilford Hall and
85 at Brooke Army. President Bush was to visit the wounded on New
Year's Eve, officials said.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tucked away in the hills of southern
Scotland, Lockerbie is the kind of small market town that few
American tourists would ever have known about had it not been for
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Now, many know its quiet streets, verdant fields dotted with
grazing sheep and family-run shops as well as they know their own
neighborhoods in New York, Detroit and the many other cities the
victims called home.
   Because of the disaster, close ties have been forged between
many of the town's 3,500 residents and bereaved American relatives.
   ``There was a bond created that will last forever,'' said Joe
Horgan, a Philadelphia contractor whose brother-in-law was on the
doomed flight on Dec. 21, 1988.
   ``There were times when we lost our faith in our fellow man, but
you only have to come here to have it restored. These people
reached out in the midst of their own devastation and guided us.''
   All 259 passengers and crew members died when a bomb concealed
inside a radio-cassette player exploded in the plane's forward
cargo hold. Eleven townspeople were killed by fiery wreckage that
plummeted 31,000 feet from the winter sky.
   Local residents, grieving for their friends and neighbors and
still shocked by the destruction of their homes and streets, did
yeoman duty in the following days recovering bodies and wreckage.
   Later, they laundered victims' bloodstained clothing to be
returned to relatives.
   They formed a Lockerbie Friendship Group to help anyone who
needed to make the pilgrimage to the fields, churchyards and farms
where their loved ones fell. They welcomed them, provided
transportation and as often as not, lent an ear to listen or a
shoulder to cry on.
   Members of the group refuse to give interviews but issued a
statement saying: ``For some relatives, one visit is enough. In any
cases lasting friendships have been formed.''
   Paul and Eleanor Hudson, whose 16-year-old daughter, Melina, was
on Flight 103, stayed in the home of the local Church of England
vicar for last week's anniversary services. Earlier this year, they
welcomed a Scottish journalist into their Albany, N.Y., home.
   The local Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Patrick Keegans, whose
neighbors died when the plane's fuel-laden fuselage struck their
home, became close to Bert Ammerman of New Jersey whose brother,
Tom, was killed.
   At an ecumenical service in the town square marking the first
anniversary of the bombing, the Keegans read aloud a letter from an
unidentified American relative who said: ``I shall return each year
to walk the streets of Lockerbie and visit with the gentle people.''
   ``Whether we like it or not, Lockerbie has become a place of
pilgrimage,'' said retired doctor Alistair Cameron. ``We have got
to be able to meet these people now and in the future and help them
express their grief.''
   Permanent memorials small and large have been erected in several
parts of Lockerbie, from a four-ton granite slab inscribed with all
270 names to a gallery of photographs in front of the alter of Holy
Trinity Catholic church.
   The night before the first anniversary of the bombing, Horgan
presented the town with an engraved plaque of appreciation.
   ``Our dear friends of Lockerbie, we feel bound to you by a chain
of grief and love so strong that it can never be broken,'' its
message says.
   ``Please accept out heartfelt gratitude for your kindness,
compassion, sympathy and kinship. We are all refreshed by your
goodness.''
   The plaque is to hang in the refurbished town hall, which served
as a morgue in the days after the disaster.

<HEAD>Last Full-Blooded Kwaaymii Indian, Teller Of Tribal Lore, Dead at
87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tomas Lucas, the last full-blooded Kwaaymii
Indian, has died at age 87 in the Laguna Mountains area that was
home to his ancestors for centuries.
   Lucas, who eagerly retold his tribe's history and described its
cultural traditions for audiences ranging from anthropologists to
elementary school children, died Thursday, said his daughter Carmen
Lucas.
   In his final days, Lucas contracted pneumonia, she said.
   ``He knew he was dying. He told us so,'' she said. ``He told us
of his disturbing dreams where he was surrounded by angels, but
when he reached out to touch them, their wings turned to paper.''
   Because Lucas was the last full-blooded member of the dwindling
tribe, Kwaaymii elders had forced him to learn and repeat the
tribal history.
   Anthropologists and archaeologists came to hear his recounting
of tribal history and many hours of his monologues were recorded on
videotape during talks with children from a nearby school.
   ``I guess that I'm the only one today that remembers the past,''
he told a reporter last year. ``I was the only child and no kids to
play with.
   ``At night, I was bound to listen. Listen to stories, listen to
prayers. ``By keeping my ears open, as I most generally have, I
picked up quite a few things. Some things I wasn't supposed to know
I heard anyway.''
   During World War II, Lucas moved to San Diego where he worked
until he retired at age 70. He returned to the former Kwaaymii
reservation land where he was raised about five years ago.
   Beside Carmen, Lucas is survived by a second daughter, Jacquelyn
Pfingst of San Diego, and three grandchildren.
   An all-night wake was scheduled to begin at sunset Wednesday,
followed by burial Thursday at the former reservation burial
grounds.

<HEAD>Director Says She'll Be `Cheerleader' For 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Director Barbara E. Bryant views
herself as head cheerleader for the team of statisticians,
interviewers, geographers and demographers who will conduct next
year's massive effort to count and categorize the American
population.
   Mrs. Bryant, who took office last week after President Bush used
a parliamentary tactic to install her without Senate confirmation,
says the groundwork for ``monumental task'' of conducting the 1990
census has been laid.
   ``What I can do now is be a cheerleader. I am really committed
to helping this bureau have a full and accurate count of the
population,'' she said, adding that most of the planning, going
back to 1984, has been done by others.
   The job has been complicated by the flow of immigrants and
illegal aliens into the United States over the past decade. After
heated debate, Congress voted this year to include illegal aliens
and military personnal stationed overseas in the census.
   Officials believe 1.6 percent of the population wasn't counted
in 1980, including a disproportionately high number of blacks and
other racial minorities who often are fearful about taking part in
the census count.
   The Census Bureau, in an attempt to target such
``hard-to-enumerate'' groups, is trying to overcome their fear and
suspicion by working through local grassroots organizations,
especially in urban centers.
   ``Some people don't believe the census is really confidential,''
said Mrs. Bryant. ``Then there are education and language problems
with some segments of the population ... and other people just
distrust the government.''
   She said, ``Every opportunity I have, I'll be getting the word
out. It's confidential. I promise.''
   Mrs. Bryant, 63, is the first woman director of the Census
Bureau, but she's accustomed to blazing trails. In 1947 she became
one of the first women to gain an editorial rank with a McGraw-Hill
Publishing Co. magazine.
   ``I was never the full-time wife and mother type,'' she said.
She married and took an 11-year break to raise three children, but
continued freelance writing and editing.
   She began as a science writer and editor. But while pursuing a
doctorate at Michigan State University, ``I got totally hooked on
communication research'' and later joined Market Opinion Research
of Detroit. In 1977 she became senior vice president of the
company, whose president until recently was Bush campaign adviser
Robert Teeter.
   Mrs. Bryant says she does not consider herself to be a political
appointee and that most of her projects with Market Opinion
Research were non-political. They included studies for
universities, presidential commissions, government agencies and
media organizations.
   For municipal transit authorities, she developed proposals for
making city bus and subway travel more popular. For National
Geographic and Harlequin Books, she crafted strategies for
increasing readership.
   She conducted polls for Detroit news organizations on issues
ranging from casino gambling to putting a dome on Tiger Stadium.
   ``I always felt if I were her age I wouldn't have the energy to
run all over the country the way she does,'' said James Leiman,
another company vice president. ``She's a driven, upbeat, motivated
person.''
   Some critics question the accuracy of polling, but Mrs. Bryant
defends it.
   ``You have to watch for people giving socially acceptable
answers,'' she says. ``But the American public is basically pretty
honest.''
   For relaxation, Mrs. Bryant swims half a mile a day and dabbles
in gardening and cooking. But she'll have little leisure time for
the next year as the census goes forward.
   Bush nominated Mrs. Bryant for the census post in September. But
when Congress recessed for the year last month, the Senate had yet
to take a confirmation vote.
   Bush announced Dec. 7 he was giving her a ``recess
appointment.'' Under the Constitution, an individual appointed by
the president while the Senate is on an extended recess can serve
until the end of the following year without Senate confirmation.
   Mrs. Bryant says she hopes to be confirmed next year and serve
as long as Bush wants her.

   After Nicolae Ceausescu took power in
Romania in 1965, the armed forces saw their role diminished and
watched the dreaded security forces receive the best equipment,
training and pay.
   The entire army of 180,000 men turned against Ceausescu in the
popular revolt that ousted him Friday and was fighting some of the
most loyal pro-Ceausescu security forces, Bucharest radio reported.
Other ``Securitate'' troops were reported to have gone over to the
army.
   While territorial defense was emphasized under Ceausescu,
defense expenditures were reduced, and the government greatly
expanded the army's role on building sites and in ``militarized'
sectors of the mismanaged economy, such as the mines and
coal-fueled power stations.
   The army also was used in Romanian agriculture and on
Ceausescu's pet projects, such as the the Black Sea Canal, which
turned out to be unprofitable.
   ``After more than 20 years of Ceausescu's rule ... (the army of)
Romania has the oldest and poorest equipment of any East European
state, and it is not maintained at high standards,'' Thomas O.
Cason said in a 1982 study of East European military forces
published in Wilmington, Del.
   Ceausescu had reason to distrust his army, after several
generals plotted to overthrow him in 1984.
   Romanian officials have said privately that the generals were
apprehended, killed and their bodies were thrown from a helicopter
into the Black Sea.
   Knowledgeable Romanians say the army is outnumbered by specially
trained and recruited security troops numbering some 700,000 men,
equipped with the most sophisticated warfare and paid three times
the average Romanian's monthly salary of about $300.
   ``The army is nothing compared with the degree of training of
these shock troops, which Ceausescu disguised as military units
wearing almost the same kind of uniform,'' Mirceas Stoica, a
professor of law at Bucharest University, told The Associated Press
after fleeing to Hungary last week.
   He said he learned this from a friend who is a security colonel
and from other sources.
   They said Ceausescu kept thousands of these troops in each of
Romania's 40 counties, and that he had several security force
divisions around Bucharest ``ready to intervene.'' They were
equipped with tanks, helicopters and guns.
   ``Ceausescu grew increasingly security-conscious over the years,
as the number of public protests to his harsh rule intensified,''
said Mihnea Berindei, an exile historian living in Paris.
   Army officers, speaking on Bucharest radio, said Friday they
discovered a network of secret tunnels running for 2.5 miles
between the party headquarters and Ceausescu's new palace ``Casa
Republicii'' in downtown Bucharest, up to a lake in the northern
part of the city.
   Entrances to some tunnels were masked by nondescript panels in
subway stations. The tunnels contained weapons caches and were used
only by Ceausescu's most loyal security troops, the radio said.
   The radio appealed repeatedly to architects who had been
involved in building such secret caches to come forward and divulge
the layout to the army and other forces behind the anti-Ceausescu
revolt.
   Romania for many years has been one of the main training camps
for Arab and African commandos trained in guerrilla warfare, as
Ceausescu formed cordial relations with PLO leader Yasser Arafat
and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Several years ago, Ceausescu ``borrowed'' Arab terrorist troops
as a security precaution, including Arafat's body guard of about 50
men, Stoica said.
   A Romanian radio announcer Saturday appealed to army units and
the population to help defend the national radio station against
``Arab troops.''
   ``Foreign mercenaries arrived by helicopter during the night.
They were prepared in a secret training camp near Bucharest by the
biggest enemy of our nation, Ceausescu,'' the announcer said.

   Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his
wife, Elena, were captured by the army today, one day after a
bloody popular revolt swept them from power, the new provisional
government said.
   Ion Iliescu, a member of the provisional government, known as
the National Salvation Committee, said on Romanian television that
the ``dictatorial family, Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, was
captured.''
   Referring to Ceausescu as a ``poison hyena,'' Iliescu said the
former hard-line Communist president, who had ruled since 1965, and
his wife, the second most powerful person in the country under the
old regime, would be tried.
   Iliescu also announced the capture of Emil Bobu, the third most
powerful person in the country, and Ceausescu's brother, Ilie,
formerly a deputy defense minister. No other details on the
reported captures were provided.
   Romanian radio, like the television in the hands of the
anti-Ceausescu forces, also swiftly reported the announcement of
the captures.
   If the Nicolae Ceausescu's capture is confirmed, the development
should provide a big boost to army soldiers and civilians still
battling better-equipped security forces loyal to Ceausescu in
fighting that has claimed hundreds of lives nationwide since the
dictator was ousted Friday.
   Ceausescu and his wife fled Bucharest on Friday in a helicopter
from the roof of the presidential palace, ending his 24 year rule.
   Their son, Nicu, a regional Communist Party chief, had already
been captured and shown on Romanian television.
   Before today's announcement, numerous conflicting reports on
Ceausescu and his wife had said they were captured, then escaped;
that they had fled the nation; and that they were directing their
forces from outside Bucharest.
   However, today's announcement was the first definite word from
the opposition that Ceausescu was in their hands.
   A provisional government comprised of generals and dissident
politicians and backed by the army declared itself for democracy
and free elections but was clearly having trouble maintaining
control today.
   Bucharest radio and TV repeatedly appealed to people and army
units to rush to the capital and aid soldiers outnumbered by the
enemy security forces.
   State television said the Soviet Embassy pledged personnel and
equipment to aid the popular forces, but Czechoslovakia's CTK news
agency quoted the embassy as saying any aid would be restricted to
food and other non-lethal material.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his country was
standing by with assistance, but he failed to promise anything more
than medicine.
   ``We have to support them from the point of view of medical help
and maybe some other kinds of help, but to bring in forces, I think
that's impermissible,'' Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said.
   At least eight Romanian embassies abroad switched loyalties to
anti-Ceausescu forces as the armed revolt entered its second day,
among them legations in Moscow, Austria, Canada, Yugoslavia, Poland
and Israel.
   Romanian emigres in touch with Bucharest said untrained
civilians are being enlisted by anti-Ceausescu forces.
   ``We expect the army to win in the end. But the Ceausescu
security forces are well-trained, well-armed, and they are fighting
for survival,'' said Mrs. Iolanda Stranescu, president of the
British Romanian Association in London.
   Gorbachev said ``a number of other measures'' were being worked
out with Warsaw Pact allies, and that a special working group was
monitoring events in Romania. He provided no other details.
   Fighting was fierce in Bucharest, where the army and civilians
who took up arms were defending state television and radio
headquarters and trying to capture the fire gutted presidential
palace from Ceausescu loyalists.
   As dawn broke over Bucharest, anti-Ceausescu soldiers posted
atop the TV building fought with pockets of loyalists in nearby
apartment buildings in a firefight that lit up the early morning
sky.
   Rocket-propelled grenades slammed into the TV building and
defenders answered with machine-gun and rifle fire.
   Bucharest radio reported intense combat in Brasov, the country's
second-largest city, and fighting in another central city, Sibiu.
   It said more than 12,000 people had been killed in Timisoara
alone since the uprising began Dec. 15 with demonstrations in that
western city.
   Scattered gunfire continued today in Timisoara, residents
reclaimed the streets after the army appeared to establish control.
   The slaughter of demonstrators by security forces in Timisoara
touched off in this country of 23 million people the quickest and
bloodiest revolution Eastern Europe has seen in turmoil this year
that has toppled one-party Communist rule in Poland, Hungary, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Among the Timisoara dead were 7,614 people first detained then
executed, said the Bucharest radio report, which was impossible to
independently verify.
   The radio also announced that all political prisoners had been
released.
   The fighting in Romanian cities today blocked urgently needed
medical supplies, the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Geneva reported.
   Sokeswoman Marjolaine Martin said an Red Cross workers flown
from Geneva to Bucharest with four tons of supplies Friday were
unable to reach the center of Bucharest this morning because of the
fighting.
   Ms. Martin said the Red Cross also had reports that trucks with
medical supplies trying to cross into Romania from Hungary also
remained blocked today because the ``borders are closed.''
   Early this morning, a tank belonging to the anti-Ceausescu army
units crushed veteran French television reporter Jean-Louis
Calderon during the chaotic fighting outside the Central Committee
headquarters.
   Calderon, 31, was reporting on the clash when he was run over by
one of about 30 armored vehicles that entered the square.
   Elsewhere in the capital, an Associated Press reporter saw
pro-uprising soldiers bring reinforcements of tanks and heavy
artillery to direct against the presidential palace.
   Taxis with red crosses rushed the wounded to hospitals. In the
city's emergency hospital, about 50 bodies were piled in one room.
Most were civilians.
   ``That was just one room in one hospital,'' said producer
Wolfgang Roehr of a British VisNews TV crew at the hospital. ``We
saw trucks full of what must have been hundreds of coffins.''
   Bucharest radio said military helicopters piloted by
pro-Ceausescu forces dropped leaflets in the city center that
warned the popular forces to ``stop before its too late.''
   The new government had arrested key figures from the ousted
regime, including the interior minister and the chief of the secret
police, who later went on national radio to urge support for the
uprising.

   For $110.89, you can watch a Russian
revolution once a minute in Bangkok.
   You can also do pretty much the same for less _ $97.27 less to
be precise _ but your version of the Soviet Army Watch will come
from Taiwan and not Moscow.
   Billed by its promoters as the most exciting fashion accessory
of 1989, the genuine Soviet Army Watch arrived in Bangkok on Dec.
1, but counterfeit versions have been on open street sale for
several months now.
   Charnchai Kheangprakhong, manager of Zur-Ton International,
which markets the real Soviet Army Watch in Thailand, said he is
not worried by the flood of cheap imitations.
   ``It is not a problem _ you can tell which is genuine and which
is not _ there is a big difference in quality,'' he said, adding
that he expects sales of the real watch to surpass 10,000 in the
first year.
   ``It is a hot fashion item,'' he said.
   The fake watches came to Thailand partly because of the big
demand for them after the Soviet Army Watch was launched in Europe
and the United States, he said.
   ``People couldn't get the real one here so they brought in the
fake ones,'' he said.
   The latest symbol of glasnost is also the latest counterfeit
item to be found on the streets of Bangkok. It vies with cheap
imitations of Rolex and Cartier watches as well as hundreds of
other products including old favorites like Luis Vuitton luggage
and Lacoste polo shirts.
   Most counterfeit products are made domestically, but some
imitation watches or watch parts are smuggled in from Taiwan.
   As one Western businessman living in Thailand remarked:
``Copyright here basically means `the right to copy.'''

   President Bush's order to send American troops
into combat in Panama, initially greeted with broad support in
Congress, could backfire politically if casualties continue to
mount and the United States becomes bogged down there.
   The dangers are clear.
   How high will the U.S. death toll climb? Will deposed ruler
Manuel Noriega continue to evade U.S. forces that were once
confident of capturing him?
   Will the fragile government of Guillermo Endara, installed by
the United States but dependent on U.S. power for his authority,
take hold?
   How long before U.S. forces can be withdrawn?
   And, what about American hostages?
   The hazards were demonstrated after Bush declared the situation
``pretty well wrapped up'' Thursday and military officers described
it as a mopping-up operation.
   On Friday, Noriega loyalists attacked the headquarters of U.S.
military forces and Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander in chief of
the U.S. Southern Command, said U.S. forces were still fighting ``a
real war.''
   The stubborn resistance prompted the Pentagon to order an
additional 2,000 soldiers into Panama, backing up a force of nearly
24,000 already there.
   For now, the political support for Bush's action seems to be
holding.
   ``We're in the adrenalin-pumping stage, the first
rally-around-the-flag moments,'' said Stephen Hess, a Brookings
Institution senior fellow and specialist on the presidency. ``There
hasn't been any major downside but you can start seeing it coming.''
   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said,
``The first reaction is to support the president but then the
doubts start seeping in and the worries and the questions.''
   William Schneider, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute and a political analyst, said, ``The only question is
whether it's going to work and whether it's going to work quickly.
   ``Americans don't like to make an open-ended commitment
anywhere, particularly where it involves the loss of American
lives,'' Schneider said.
   ``Americans believe we should win or get out. In Grenada, we
won. In Lebanon, we got out.''
   Bush said U.S. forces will chase Noriega ``as long as it
takes.'' He said the deployment of combat troops in Panama is
open-ended as the chase continues and U.S. forces try to restore
some semblance of order to the country.
   Already, there are demands in Congress for American troops to be
brought home quickly.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said some U.S. forces might have to remain as police
until ``Christmas Eve a year from now.''
   A military operation initially described as a three- to four-day
mission now stretches into the indefinite future.
   White House officials insist, however, that the operation is
following the script they envisioned.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gen. Colin
Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Bush
last Sunday on the risks and ``laid it out almost exactly as it
materialized.''
   He said Powell accurately predicted Noriega would not be
captured immediately, that hostages might be taken and that there
would be a protracted period before U.S. forces would wrest control
of Panama City from Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces and his
so-called Dignity Battalions.
   Fitzwater also said the U.S. death count will not be large.
   ``It doesn't seem likely there would be large-scale engagements
with large amounts of casualties,'' he said.
   Before the invasion, U.S. intelligence sources had reported that
Noriega was drinking heavily and that his mental state had
deteriorated.
   ``General Noriega ... has been acting irrationally, beyond his
normal conduct,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   Nunn said administration officials, in private briefings for
Congress, ``made a very strong case'' for the invasion. However,
there are fears that public opinion may turn against Bush if the
operation drags on.
   Hess said Bush ``probably doesn't have more than a month of real
grace. The trick is always that it doesn't become our war.''
   Schneider, the AEI analyst, said, ``The best outcome for the
Bush administration would be for this guy to be dead, not make
trouble for anybody.''
   But the Panamanian leader remains at large, while U.S.
casualties mount. And even if he is captured, the onetime CIA
operative could make some embarrassing demands for secret documents
if brought to trial in the United States.
   ``He knows where a lot of skeletons are buried in Central
America and some of them may be very close to Bush's office,''
Schneider said, noting contacts between Bush's vice presidential
staff and key figures in the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``If Noriega's caught,'' Schneider said, ``that's not the end of
the matter.''

<HEAD>Judge's Advocacy of Legalized Drugs Prompts Criticism, Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In June, a man convicted of selling nearly a
half kilogram of crack went before U.S. District Judge Robert
Sweet. He spoke of his family and his wish to lead a productive
life, and he pleaded for mercy.
   Sweet, who this month became the first federal judge to publicly
advocate drug legalization, reluctantly sentenced the defendant to
20 years in prison. Bound by federal sentencing guidelines, his
frustration was evident.
   ``I know of no basis upon which I could accede to your plea,
though I think it is entirely reasonable, and I regret that
intensely,'' he said.
   ``It is a mechanical task. I am a clerk,'' the judge complained.
   His frustration festered, along with the perception that the
judicial system was being overburdened by ``a social phenomenon.''
   And so, in a speech Dec. 12, Sweet declared the war on drugs was
``bankrupt.'' The lifelong Republican and former federal prosecutor
suggested that drugs like marijuana, crack and heroin be legalized
and treated like alcohol _ taxed, regulated and made illegal for
minors.
   ``I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition - to cease
treating indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime,'' Sweet said in
his speech. ``More money, more prisoners, more addicts _ these
numbers demonstrate to me our present prohibitive policy has
failed, flatly and without serious question.''
   The reaction was instantaneous. The president's drug czar,
William Bennett, condemned Sweet's remarks as ``stupid'' and
``morally atrocious.'' Vice President Dan Quayle denounced him;
Gov. Mario Cuomo said he considered legalization ``a sellout.''
   But others came to his defense.
   ``I think he's a courageous man,'' said Baltimore Mayor Kurt
Schmoke. ``All he's trying to do is get our country to admit the
failure of current policy and to persuade national policy-makers to
consider a more efficient alternative to controlling drug abuse and
drug-related crime.''
   ``Judge Sweet has learned a great deal and is everywhere honored
as a wise man and experienced jurist. What he said needs thinking
about,'' wrote conservative columnist William F. Buckley.
   Both Schmoke and Buckley had previously supported legalization _
Schmoke set off a firestorm in April 1988 when he suggested the
idea to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Others who have broached the
proposal range from former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark to
economist Milton Friedman to former Secretary of State George
Shultz. Each has been targeted by critics.
   ``Sometimes at a reception or party I advance these views and
people head for somebody else. They don't even want to talk to
you...,'' said Shultz, in an October speech to alumni of Stanford
Business School. ``No politician wants to say what I just said, not
for a minute.''
   Sweet's remarks were especially provocative because of his 11{
years on the federal bench. To lawyers and judges who know him,
Sweet is a thoughtful, intelligent and fair judge whose opinion
should not be easily dismissed.
   ``The man is obviously in the eye of the hurricane,'' said David
Breitbart, an attorney who has represented clients before Sweet.
``If he says the war on drugs is a failure then he has seen it on a
firsthand basis in the courts.''
   Sweet did not answer numerous requests for an interview.
   Sweet's experience with the drug problem dates back to the late
1960s when as a deputy New York City mayor, he helped supervise
treatment programs for addicts. Recent sentencings reflect his
continued belief in rehabilitation.
   In October, Sweet imposed a one-year prison term, the lightest
sentence allowed by the guidelines, on a 29-year-old man who
pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   Noting that it was the first conviction for the employed father
of two young children, the judge said in a sentencing memorandum
that any longer sentence would interfere with, rather than
facilitate, rehabilitation.
   Sweet also ordered the defendant to undergo drug testing and
treatment during three years of probation following his prison term.
   His colleagues said Sweet's public stand for drug legalization
would not affect his work as a judge.
   Chief Judge Charles L. Brieant of the Southern District of New
York said Sweet would continue to be assigned narcotics cases.
   ``The judges of the court are confident that Judge Sweet will
honor his oath of office and administer the law as it stands,''
said Brieant. ``A judge doesn't lose his First Amendment rights by
becoming a judge.''

   Romanian embassies in 13 countries today denounced the ousted
regime of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and supported the new
provisional government that took power in their country.
   Embassies in the Soviet Union, France, Tunisia, Jordan, Poland,
Yugoslavia, Austria, Belgium, Turkey, Spain, Canada, Israel and
Bangladesh all supported the popular revolt that has claimed
hundreds of lives in Romania.
   As fighting continued between army soldiers who sided with
Romanian citizens and security forces loyal to Ceausescu, the
Soviet news agency Tass said the Romanian Embassy in Moscow had
sided with the provisional government.
   ``The entire staff of the Romanian Embassy in the Soviet Union
is in full solidarity with the National Salvation Committee, the
new supreme body of power in Romania, and with its platform,'' Tass
said. The news agency said it had received the statement from the
Romanian Embassy in Moscow.
   The uprising toppled the hard-line Communist leader on Friday.
The provisional government that took over promised free elections
in April.
   This afternoon, 30 Moscow dissidents and human rights activists
gathered outside the Romanian Embassy to conduct a memorial service
for the hundreds of people who have been killed in the revolt
against Ceausescu.
   The Romanian Embassy in France supported the provisional
government, and Ambassador Petre Gigea said: ``We are completely in
solidarity with the fundamental changes now going on in Romania.''
He said he was ready to meet with Romanian exiles in Paris to find
the best way to help the new regime.
   The Romanian Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia, took similar action. A
communique signed by charge d'affaires Marin Albu proclaimed that
``all the embassy personnel are with'' the new government.
   The statement said the Romanian Embassy in Jordan has taken
similar action.
   In Poland, Romanian Ambassador Ion Tesu stood outside his Warsaw
Embassy, which had been splattered with ink by anti-Ceausescu
protesters, to say he and the diplomats inside were ``in solidarity
with the heroic outburst of national bravery'' under way in his
homeland.
   The Romanian Embassy in Yugoslavia declared that it fully
supports the provisional government in Romania, the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug reported.
   Press Attache Ion Makovei, speaking on behalf of Ambassador
Dumitru Popa and the embassy staff in Belgrade ``strongly
condemned'' Ceausescu's ``criminal actions in Romania,'' Tanjug
said.
   In Austria, Romanian Ambassador Trandafir Cocarla said he
represented the new government of his country.
   ``We are very happy that our people can at last live in freedom
and democracy,'' his spokesman said, adding that the embassy was
now called the Romanian Embassy instead of the Embassy of the
Socialist Republic of Romania.
   In Brussels, Belgium, Romanian ambassador George Ciucu said:
``We express our solidarity with ... the Romanian army who are at
the service of the people. The country does not need bloodshed, it
has suffered enough.''
   The staff of the Romanian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, issued a
statement saying: ``We, the personnel of the Romanian Embassy,
declare that we are giving full support to the aims and the program
of the National Salvation Committee.''
   Jea Moncea, the Romanian ambassador in Spain, told Spain's
national news agency EFE that the embassy in Madrid ``totally
backs'' the provisional government in Romania and ``condemns'' the
Ceausescu regime.
   About 50 Romanian refugees demonstrated outside the Romanian
Embassy in Madrid to denounce the killings in their homeland.
   Romania's ambassador to Israel, Iulian Bituleanu, said his staff
had also decided to support the provisional government. Earlier
today, embassy workers tore the Communist emblem off the embassy
gate and draped across the building a red, black and yellow
Romanian flag with the Communist emblem ripped out.
   ``The entire staff of the Romanian Tel Aviv Embassy has joined
in identifying with the people,'' Bituleanu told journalists.
   The Romanian ambassador in Canada, Emilian Rodean, said he hoped
the uprising achieves a ``real Romania.''
   Speaking in Ottawa, Rodean said he and his staff applauded
Romanians for throwing out ``the personal dictatorship regime of
Ceausescu.''
   He said he and the staff had not received any instructions from
Romania since the hard-line Communist leader was ousted.
   Luchian Petrescu, the charge d'affaires at the Romanian Embassy
in Dhaka, Bangladesh, said in a statement that the embassy ``fully
and firmly supports the political program of the committee of
national salvation.''

   The Chinese government gave Beijing Catholics a
Christmas gift Saturday, returning St. Michael's church more than
three decades after it was confiscated for secular use.
   Pale winter sunlight gleamed through the few remaining stained
glass windows as more than 200 Catholics, led by Bishop Fu Tieshan,
re-consecrated the 87-year-old Gothic building with song and prayer.
   ``I can't see the music very well but I remember it,'' said
white-haired Brother Zhang Delong, who played the new organ to
accompany the choir as it sang a traditional Latin Mass.
   The church, its gray brick spires towering over a tree-lined
street in central Beijing, was built in 1902 to serve the foreign
diplomatic community. The Communist government seized it in 1958
and made it a school.
   Other churches were closed in the 1960s, during the far-leftist
Cultural Revolution that treated religion as a threat to Communism.
St. Michael's is the fifth Catholic church to reopen in urban
Beijing, where nearly 40,000 Catholics live.
    Its return, two days before Christmas, caps a year that tested
Chinese Christians' longstanding determination to keep out of
politics.
   Some Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, joined the
pro-democracy marches of the spring. A group of young Catholic
seminarians reportedly gave small amounts of money and food to the
protesters, and several Protestants were arrested for their roles
in the short-lived union set up by protesting workers.
   But the church hierarchies, appointed with government approval
and closely watched, kept silent even while other official organs,
such as the government-run union, supported the democracy movement.
   After crushing the protests in June, the government cracked down
hard on most of the traditionally suspect segments of society, such
as intellectuals. But the churches, which suffered in past
hard-line backlashes, have been largely unscathed.
   Since June, the government-sponsored Chinese Catholic Patriotic
Association, which has no ties with the Vatican, has ordained six
new priests, boosting the number in Beijing to 24. Seven young
women took vows as nuns, the first to do so in Beijing since the
Communists took power in 1949.
   ``The events of June did not affect the church. I believe that's
because the church transcends politics,'' said Ying Mulan, vice
secretary-general of the Beijing Catholic Patriotic Association.
   ``We don't want to get involved in political activities,'' she
said. In countries where most of the population is Catholic, such
as the Philippines, she said, churches may play a political role.
But in an officially athiest country such as China, its best policy
is to seek what common ground it can with the government.
   Bishop Fu, addressing the congregation in St. Michael's, told
them to pray for ``anding tuanjie'' _ stability and unity _ words
used often by the government since June.
   Christians who reject the government-sponsored Catholic and
Protestant churches and worship in illegal house churches also try
hard to be politically neutral.
   ``In the spring, we told the faithful three things: don't go
look at the protests, don't speak, and come to services,'' said a
Protestant house-church minister. Because of that, he said, police
have not interfered with the Sunday gatherings of his group of
about 20.
   But conflicts still arise periodically between the government
and religious believers. In contrast with St. Michael's peaceful
transfer, about 1,000 Catholics in central China tried on their own
in April to retake a former church, and were driven out by police.
Catholic sources in Hong Kong said two people were killed.
   The sources have reported at least four arrests this year of
Catholic clergy loyal to the Vatican.
   Since June, some high school and college students disillusioned
with the Communist Party have begun attending Christian churches. A
young man at St. Michael's said they come ``because they feel empty
inside.''

   The Pentagon dispatched 2,000 more combat
troops into Panama today in the face of continued, unexpectedly
stiff resistance from loyalists of fugitive Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The fresh troops, from the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division,
were being airlifted throughout the day from Fort Ord, Calif., as
U.S. commanders in Panama reported burgeoning concern over the
harassing attacks _ and weapons supplies _ of Noriega's so-called
dignity battalions.
   The new arrivals joined 24,000 U.S. troops already in Panama,
many of them bone-weary, as the nation's largest military force to
see combat since Vietnam faced a changed mission _ from
conventional warfare to counterterrorism.
   U.S. military officials also reported that prisoners at an
island penitentiary apparently had overcome their pro-Noriega
guards and had radioed for help from American forces. The prison
group was said to include some of the former Panamanian officers
who led a failed coup attempt on Oct. 3.
   Pentagon officials put the U.S. casualty count at 24 soldiers
killed, 238 wounded and two missing. In addition, they said, two
civilian dependents have been reported killed.
   In Panama City, Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the U.S.
Southern Command, said 139 of Noriega's fighters had been killed.
Though the Panamanian Defense Forces were neutralized quickly by
the U.S. assault which began early Wednesday, Noriega's hit-and-run
dignity battalions are ``increasing their activities of harassing
attacks with small arms and mortar fire, threatening the civilian
population, and hostage-taking,'' he said.
   When pressed for specific numbers, Marguila replied ``I don't
have in my mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday
of dignity-battalion efforts. It's just that they are becoming more
of a concern, because they are taking more of our time as opposed
to the PDF.''
   At the Pentagon, one military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, conceded the ferocity of the dignity battalions had
caught U.S. commanders off guard. And he said that despite the U.S.
seizure of several large weapons caches, it appeared that the
Noriega die-hards still had access to fresh arms.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was at the Pentagon on Saturday to
keep tabs on developments in Panama as well as the bloody
revolution which ousted Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
President Bush was at Camp David, Md., where he worked on a
Christmas Eve address to the American military men and women around
the globe.
   Noriega, meanwhile, continued to defy capture despite a rash of
rumors as to his whereabouts.
   ``It's simply a difficult operation. ... There are a lot of
places to hide,'' Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said late Friday.
   The administration also offered what it said was new evidence of
drug dealings by Noriega _ including a 110-pound stash of cocaine
found near Noriega's private office at a military barracks.
   ``He is clearly not only a narco-trafficker, but apparently he
condones and uses the stuff himself,'' said Gen. Maxwell Thurman,
the head of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama.
   The Noriega headquarters was described as ``opulent,''
containing a movie theater, jade, art and jewels. U.S. troops also
found a picture of Adolf Hitler in a closet and an assortment of
occult and witchcraft paraphernalia, according to U.S. officials.
   The fighting with Noriega's outmanned supporters continued
despite the presence of 11,000 troops brought in Wednesday to join
the 13,000 normally stationed there.
   Members of Noriega's ``Dignity Battalions'' were waiting when
first vice president Ricardo Arias Calderon was leaving the
National Assembly on Friday and fired shots at his car. Arias was
not injured, but two aides were wounded.
   Kelly said the U.S. military is ``looking at re-establishing the
police force. He said his commanders estimated that ``clearing the
city'' would take five to 10 days.
   Thurman, in Panama City, said more ``civil affairs units'' were
being brought to help re-establish civil systems in areas of
economics, public facilities and such special functions as
displaced persons, refugees and evacuees.
   Bush went to Camp David, Md., for the Christmas holiday, but
White House officials said he would attend a briefing Sunday at the
Pentagon.
   Bush was briefed by telephone Saturday morning at Camp David by
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft on both the Panama
situation and developments in Romania, White House spokesman Sean
Walsh said. Walsh provided no details of the briefing.
   Bush was scheduled to make a 5-minute radio address over the
Armed Forces Network on Sunday and Walsh said part of the message
would be directed at servicemen in Panama.
   Bush plans to visit soldiers wounded in Panama in a Houston
hospital on Dec. 31.
   Panama's new ambassador to Washington, Carlos Rodriguez, moved
into the embassy on Friday after meeting with Bush. The keys to the
mission were turned over to him by a State Department official in
late afternoon.
   Congressional leaders received briefings about the situation in
Panama by the Pentagon, State Department and CIA.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
said the briefing had underscored his support for the operation and
said the administration ``made a very strong case for
justification.''
   Nunn said that beyond the initial reasons for the military
actions cited by President Bush, there was evidence that ``General
Noriega himself ... has been acting irrationally beyond his normal
conduct.''
   Offers were made to Noriega through diplomatic channels that he
could leave for a third country _ one that has no extradition
treaty with the United States, Nunn said. ``He was given an
opportunity, another course not to have to confront the United
States,'' the senator added.
   Nunn said it was clear the invasion was launched without a good
fix on Noriega's whereabouts, but called it a rare flaw in an
otherwise well-run operation.
   Both Kelly, in the Pentagon, and Gen. Maxwell Thurman in Panama,
said an astounding cache of weapons was seized by American troops
in Noriega's headquarters.
   ``One wonders what the intentions of Noriega were,'' the general
said, referring to the 10,000 mostly Eastern bloc weapons that were
found. He acknowledged that Noriega's defense forces had put up a
tougher battle than expected.
   The remnants of Noriega's armed civilian battalions, he said,
``are looting, sniping, they are lawless.'' But, he said, ``I'm
satisfied it's under control. We're not getting anything we can't
handle.''

<TEXT>
   On a frosty Christmas Eve some years ago, author
Cleveland Amory was in ill spirits. Manhattan sparkled with a fresh
blanket of snow, but it didn't matter. He wasn't a man prone to
merriment and he was alone.
   But that night a woman rapped on his door asking for help to
catch a cat in an alley between two midtown towers.
   Amory reluctantly followed her outside and amid the debris, he
saw the cat _a ghost of a cat, really, bone-thin, dirty, wet and
shivering. He put the cat in his coat and he turned for home.
   So begins a true tale called ``The Cat Who Came for Christmas,''
and so began a relationship that changed cat and curmudgeon.
   Now the book is on a New York Times best-seller list for the
third consecutive Christmas, climbing to No. 2 in the newspaper's
paperback non-fiction category. More than 1.5 million copies have
been sold.
   The relationship, now in its 12th year, has never been so
trusting _ or so set in its ways.
   The story details their first year together, including the
trouble in naming the white cat (Polar Bear was eventually agreed
to), the trouble in traveling with a cat, the trouble with putting
a cat on diet food and the trouble with having guests.
   Polar Bear, though, had no trouble in laying down the law: Amory
must adjust to a life of being cat-owned.
   He has.
   ``You can't help but be, because they suddenly are in control,''
said the 72-year-old Amory, who had always owned dogs.
   Amory, a big bear of a man with thick, gray hair brushed
straight back from his broad forehead, is the founder and head of
the Fund for Animals. The New York-based anti-cruelty society has
been instrumental in saving infant harp seals in Canada, wild
burros in the Grand Canyon and wild goats on Navy-owned San
Clemente Island off the Southern California coast.
   The former newspaper reporter and editor also wrote six books,
including ``The Proper Bostonians,'' ``The Last Resorts,'' and
``Who Killed Society?'' He turned his attention to animal rights
more than 20 years ago after seeing a bullfight in Mexico and a
``bunny bop'' in Harmony, N.C., in which townspeople encircled
rabbits and clubbed them to death.
   Amory spends much of his time now selling his Christmas book:
One day last week he gave 13 radio interviews in a little more than
two hours. In each interview, he mentioned the tens of thousands of
animals in shelters and on the streets in need of homes.
   His story about Polar Bear, one reader wrote, ``has been
responsible for more cats being saved or adopted than any other
book.''
   ``That letter meant more to me than any of the others,'' Amory
said in an interview in his one-bedroom apartment overlooking
Central Park. The apartment is full of Polar Bear's toys: little
stuffed mice, balls on a string, catnip pouches. There's also
``Polar Bear's Christmas tree,'' decorated with cat cards.
   Green-eyed Polar Bear _ he's somewhere between 12 to 14 years
old _ was at his feet. He's plump despite diet dinners. And he
isn't very friendly, leaving the room after a pat from a visitor.
   ``He doesn't like anything that hasn't happened before. And he
doesn't need to meet any people he hasn't met before,'' said Amory.
``I think he's gotten to be more of a one-man cat.''
   And Amory is a one-cat man. They seem to have taken on some of
the same attributes in their advancing ages. They're both a bit
slower afoot and a bit quicker to snap. ``He has acquired some of
my worst traits,'' Amory said. ``Like my quick temper. He's
certainly developed toward being a curmudgeon.''
   This night before Christmas, like past ones, Amory plans to
venture out around New York while Polar Bear sleeps. He is on a
mission _ for animals.
   One year he persuaded police to order carriage horses off the
streets because of bitter cold.
   This Christmas Eve, he'll look down alleys for other Polar Bears.
   ``Every Christmas Eve, I think about finding him,'' he said,
stroking his cat. ``I'll be looking terribly careful for strays.''

   The ouster of Romania's hard-line Communist
regime caps five months of political upheaval that rocked Eastern
Europe. The events demonstrated the Kremlin's new attitude toward
countries it once treated like virtual fiefdoms. Here is a report.

   It was the fortress Stalin built, from the Baltic
to the Adriatic. It held some 100 million human souls. Two days ago
its last bastion fell, stormed by hundreds of thousands of
Romanians enraged by Nicolae Ceausescu's tyranny.
   Though the brutal security forces that kept Ceausescu in power
for 24 years fought back across the country, killing hundreds, it
was clearly the culminating act of a revolution that may deprive
the term ``Soviet bloc'' of any meaning.
   A new order in Europe, in the making through 40 years of
repression and economic failure, suddenly is being born with the
blessing and connivance of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In the 19th century, another European who thought in
continent-wide terms, the French emperor Napoleon, dreamed of a
``continental system'' to integrate the territory he conquered from
Spain to Russia. The philosophical father of communism, Karl Marx,
predicted a proletarian revolution would sweep Europe.
   Now Gorbachev, one of Marx's ideological heirs, preaches the
creation of a ``common European home'' where after years of Kremlin
domination, the nations of Eastern Europe will be virtually free to
pursue policies they set themselves.
   The fundamental changes of 1989 mean that the five East bloc
countries must set up new governments, reorganize economies and
begin to work out what kinds of relations they will have with the
Soviet Union, what ties will be forged with Western countries. The
events in East Germany raise the special issue of a reunified
Germany in the heart of Europe.
   Gorbachev's vision supplants agreements by the World War II
Allies that led to the continent's division into East and West
after the defeat of Nazi Germany.
   For more than four decades, with the Red Army serving as its
gendarme, Soviet-style communism reigned in Eastern Europe from the
Bug River on the Soviet-Polish border to the German city of Weimar,
where Bach wrote his great fugues. Europe seemed immutably divided
into socialist and capitalist camps.
   The West set up a military alliance, NATO, to deal with any
military threat, and the members of the Communist bloc formed the
Warsaw Pact.
   The schism of Europe had its hated symbol, the Berlin Wall. It
made concrete Winston Churchill's alarmed rhetoric in 1946 when he
told students at a small college in Missouri that ``from Stettin in
the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has
descended across the continent.''
   True, there were rips in that curtain _ when Yugoslavia in the
late 1940s and later Albania successfully rebelled against Moscow's
domination. But the most stunning changes awaited the advent of
Gorbachev and the whirlwind year of 1989.
   Beginning in August, hard-line regimes were ousted in Poland,
Bulgaria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and finally Romania. Roman
Catholic Tadeusz Mazowiecki became Poland's first non-Communist
premier since World War II.
   Czechoslovakia's new government is no longer
Communist-dominated, and Hungary's Parliament has approved
democratic, multiparty elections next year.
   In Berlin, millions of East Germans have poured through newly
cut breaches in the wall, personifying the growing symbiosis
between East and West. Berliners sang and danced with joy Friday
night when an opening was made in the 28-year-old wall near the
Brandenburg Gate, long a symbol of Germany's division.
   The five months that remade politics in Eastern Europe passed
with breathtaking speed. With Gorbachev in power, leaders like
Czechoslovakia's Milos Jakes and Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, who
bankrupted themselves by failing to meet human or economic needs,
could no longer count on Kremlin support.
   Without that backing, unpopular Communists had to compromise
with the people, or give up power.
   In 1942, Josef Stalin raged that the Nazis had ``turned Europe
into a prison of nations.'' But it was the Soviet dictator, his
army and his political disciples who would subjugate Central Europe
and its inhabitants after driving out the German invaders.
   In a sense, revolt began a month after Stalin's death. On an
April morning in 1953, East Berlin construction workers from the
Stalinallee site went on strike over pay cuts. Within 48 hours the
protests spread throughout the city, with demonstrators chanting
``We want to be free and not slaves!'' Mobs tried to take over
government headquarters.
   The Soviet army commandant in Berlin proclaimed a state of siege
and two motorized divisions occupied the city. Protesters who were
caught were executed. Order was restored by 9 p.m., and the Red
Army moved to crush worker revolts in Leipzig, Dresden and
elsewhere.
   The scenario was repeated in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia
in 1968, when Red Army soldiers were sent in to stop reform efforts.
   But this fall, when East German leader Erich Honecker's rule was
menaced by a popular uprising, Soviet troops remained in their
barracks, and Honecker was deposed Oct. 18.
   It was renewed proof of Gorbachev's professed unwillingness to
meddle in the internal affairs of his allies, as well as a way of
getting rid of an Old Guard Communist who rejected much of his
reform agenda.
   ``The truth, about which we spoke so often in the past few
years, has been reaffirmed once again _ where there is a delay in
dealing with overripe problems, excesses are inevitable,''
Gorbachev told Soviet Communists Dec. 9, warning them their East
European colleagues' fall from power means they must urgently solve
domestic problems.
   The Soviets stress the countries they once treated as virtual
provinces of their own nation must remain in the Warsaw Pact,
meaning Europe's ``Age of the Blocs'' is not yet over, at least
militarily.
   But with non-Communist leaders seeking a mix of capitalism and
socialism to better their citizens' lives, the East-West
ideological schism is dying.

   After their time under lights, Christmas
trees in Vermont are being put out to pasture, and on the garden
and around the shrubs on the front lawn.
   More than 8,000 trees were ground up into bits of bark and
needles during last year's ``Merry Mulch'' project, and officials
say the practice is catching on nationwide as a way to save
landfill space.
   ``It's definitely an idea that's spreading,'' said Kate
Finley-Woodruff, marketing representative for the Vermont
Department of Agriculture.
   The statewide program was started last year as an experiment by
her department and the state's Agency of Natural Resources to
encourage recycling.
   ``We were overwhelmed by the response,'' Finley-Woodruff said.
   Queries have come in from around the country about the program,
while some communities already turn Christmas trees into wood chips.
   For a second year, sanitation workers in Chicago will collect
discarded trees for mulch. Indianapolis has been mulching trees
since it canceled its Christmas tree bonfire on ``Twelth Night'' a
few years ago.
   In Vermont, the state increased the number of drop-off and
chipping sites from nine to 33 this year. Residents who want to can
take their mulch home.
   The state is getting help for ``Merry Mulch'' from several
municipalities, electric utilities, ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's
Homemade Inc. and regional solid waste managers and planners.
   Finley-Woodruff said the program developed from the problem of
solid-waste at landfills and a desire to help Vermont's Christmas
tree growers.
   ``We're trying to protect their market so people don't get
discouraged from buying a real Christmas tree because of the
landfill problems,'' she said.
   Nationwide, 34.3 million Christmas trees were sold last year and
the U.S. Agriculture Department expects sales to exceed 35 million
this year. Artificial trees were introduced in the 1950s and by
1985 held 47 percent of the market.
   Pam Dwyer, executive secretary of the New Hampshire-Vermont
Christmas Tree Association, said the state may be scaring people
into buying artificial trees.
   ``I don't have a problem with `Merry Mulch','' Dwyer said. ``But
I think it leads people to believe that Christmas trees are a solid
waste problem.''
   It takes a Christmas tree about 30 years to decompose in a
landfill, according to the American Christmas Tree Journal. An
artificial tree contains petroleum products and may never
decompose, Dwyer said.
   ``We've tried to push the idea that Christmas trees are a
renewable source,'' Dwyer said. ``I'm a forester's wife and I'm not
convinced that wood products are a solid waste problem.''
   As for her tree, Dwyer said she laces it with bread and puts it
in the yard for the birds when the family is finished with it.

<HEAD>Poland Signs Agreement to Get Millions in Western Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland has formally agreed to overhaul its
economy in exchange for $700 million in immediate credit from the
International Monetary Fund and the promise of billions more in
Western aid, officials said Saturday.
   Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and the chairman of the
National Bank of Poland, Wladyslaw Baka signed a letter of intent
that was approved by the IMF executive board in Washington, the
state news agency PAP said.
   The first credit installment could be received as early as next
week, PAP reported.
   Acceptance of the letter also launches a $1 billion fund being
prepared by Western countries to back the Polish currency, PAP said.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and his Council of Ministers
met through the night Friday, reviewing the plan in which Poland
vows to choke off 900 percent inflation, cut budget deficits and
weather the unemployment and poverty that the painful economic
reforms are likely to bring.
   The plan, negotiated since Mazowiecki formed the East bloc's
first government led by non-Communists in September, is tied to the
most extensive economic reform legislation ever attempted in the
region.
   Introduced in Parliament a week ago, the program would overhaul
the centralized state-run economy and replace it with a
market-oriented system.
   The IMF agreement will certify to Western leaders that Poland is
making serious efforts to put its economy in order and is expected
to release further loans from the World Bank and other sources. It
is also critical to arranging the rescheduling of payments on
Poland's $40 billion debt to the West.
   ``It was signed during the night. It was important to sign it as
soon as possible because the money could come pretty soon,'' said
Tomasz Drzewosowski, director of the government press office.
   In addition to the $700 million standby loan, the IMF letter of
intent is expected to lead to $300 million in World Bank loans and
about $3 billion in other Western aid.
   The $1 billion currency stabilization fund is expected to be
ready early in 1990.
   Poland is working to make its zloty internally convertible with
the hard currencies of the West, a step important to attracting the
Western business investment badly needed to replace Poland's
outmoded and unproductive industries.
   The government has asked Parliament for speedy approval of the
economic reform legislation so it can be implemented Jan. 1.
   Deputy Finance Minister Janusz Sawicki has said that if the IMF
money were not ready by Jan. 1, several Western countries probably
would offer a bridge loan until the first installment arrives.
   The IMF, one of the biggest lenders to Third World counties, is
owned by 152 governments, with the United States holding the
largest number of votes.
   The economic program anticipates that Poles' real income will
fall 20 percent, there will be a 5 percent decrease in industrial
output, and a 2 percent to 3 percent drop in the gross national
product.
   Price increases of 25 to 50 percent a month during early 1990
are expected as enterprises raise prices to survive after losing
production subsidies that have kept charges artificially low and
maintained unprofitable firms.
   Many bankruptcies are likely. The government is planning the
country's first unemployment benefits and estimates there will be
400,000 workers displaced. Under the communist system, unemployment
and poverty officially did not exist and there has been no welfare
structure.

   Soviet officials on Saturday sent medical help and
urged Warsaw Pact allies to support the uprising that ousted
Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania. They all but ruled out military
intervention.
   ``We have to support them from the point of view of medical help
and maybe some other kinds of help, but to bring in forces, I think
that's impermissible,'' Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said.
   ``We mustn't repeat mistakes,'' he told reporters at the
Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Parliament. ``Not long
ago we gave our evaluation to 1968 in Czechoslovakia. That was on
Dec. 4, and should we repeat something like that a few days later?''
   Ryzhkov was referring to a Warsaw Pact statement that condemned
the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   The irony in this instance would be the scenario of Soviet
troops helping to oust the vestiges of a Stalinist regime that, of
all the nations in the Soviet bloc, most resembles the rigid system
prior to the rise of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Romanian TV, in the hands of the opposition, said the Soviet
Embassy had pledged to send personnel and equipment to aid the
uprising.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Gorbachev told Parliament the
Kremlin ``had decided to appeal to the governments of the Warsaw
Pact states with the aim of coordinated efforts in providing
support to the people of Romania.''
   The Soviet Red Cross, Ministry of Health and other organizations
were working with similar organizations in France and Eastern
Europe to provide medicine and specialists, he said.
   ``The first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have
already arrived in Bucharest,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
``But they still are being held up in the Bucharest airport, which
is blockaded.''
   Gorbachev said ``a number of other measures'' were being worked
out with Warsaw Pact allies, and that a special working group was
monitoring events in Romania. He provided no other details.
   Tass issued a government declaration that said ``the Soviet
Union is ready to render rapid and effective humanitarian aid to
the Romanian people and the new leadership of the country to
liquidate the consequences of the tragic events of recent days.''
   Another Tass dispatch said some of the wounded were likely to be
evacuated to Moldavia, a Soviet republic bordering Romania.
Moldavians are ethnically very close to Romanians and speak an
almost identical language. Their region belonged to Romania before
World War II.
   Tass said a building housing families of the Soviet trade
delegation in Bucharest was in the line of fire between pro- and
anti-Ceausescu forces and that fires had started in the building.
   ``Tass was told by the Soviet Embassy in Romania that the
property of many Soviet institutions in Romania has been
considerably damaged, and that there are wounded among their staff
members,'' it said. It gave no details.
   ``The lives of Soviet people, including women and children, are
in serious danger,'' Tass said.
   ``The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the fate of
Soviet citizens and demands that those who have unleashed the above
actions, endangering the lives of Soviet people, should immediately
stop them,'' it said.
   Official Radio Moscow said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze met with U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock and told him
the Soviet Union regarded the events in Romania as an ``expression
of will by the Romanian people, seeking to renew society through
democracy.''
   Soviet media have pounced on the uprising in Romania, providing
readers and listeners with startling detail of the battle.
   Ceausescu resisted the kind of reforms the Soviets encouraged in
Eastern Europe.
   Romania remained part of the Soviet bloc, but relations between
Gorbachev and Ceausescu were notably cool. They last met early in
December in Moscow, when Tass described their meeting in terms that
left little doubt of sharp disagreement.

   What YWCA officials thought was to be filming
for a documentary featuring Elizabeth Taylor turned out to be a
four-week movie ``pornathon'' that prompted a police investigation
and a lawsuit.
   To the embarrassment of the women's association, a four-story
downtown building it owns was used as a set for films such as
``Wanda Does Transylvania'' and ``Wives of the Rich and Famous.''
   ``This has been a very unpleasant, unhappy situation,'' said
Ethel Sanford-Smith, associate director of the YWCA in Los Angeles.
   The YWCA's stately Clark Residence, built in 1913, previously
had been used to shoot the TV miniseries ``Winds of War'' and
``Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years.''
   This time the YWCA received partial payment purportedly for a
family-oriented documentary featuring Miss Taylor, Ms.
Sanford-Smith said. But payment was stopped on a second check after
the shooting was completed, she said.
   John Laolagi, owner of the defunct Stallion Productions in North
Hollywood, said four film crews working simultaneously in a
monthlong ``pornathon'' shot 47 ``adult'' videos. He said there was
no intent to defraud anyone.
   The filming was legal, city police Detective Greg Jones said,
but police are investigating complaints by performers and crew
members that they received a fraction of pay owed them.
   Police Sgt. Donald Smith said unpaid salaries could total
$320,000.
   Trans Pacific Marketing, an Orange County videotape and cassette
company, filed a lawsuit last month in Orange County Superior Court
against Stallion Productions and Laolagi, company attorney Yeehorn
Shuai said.
   The $894,000 lawsuit contends Laolagi committed fraud by failing
to pay for ordered videotape.
   Laolagi owes the YWCA as much as $20,000 for use of the
building, but the agency has declined invitations to join in a
lawsuit, fearing the publicity it would likely bring, Ms.
Sanford-Smith said.

<HEAD>Leftist Guerrillas Attack Army Patrol, Kill 10 Soldiers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas from the nation's
largest insurgent group ambushed an army patrol in southern
Colombia on Saturday, killing 10 soldiers, an army communique said.
   The attack came just hours after another leftist guerrilla
group, the April 19 Movement, announced it had suspended a
tentative peace pact after Congress failed to approved key parts of
the accord.
   Guerrillas belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia blew up part of the road south of the town of San Martin
as an army patrol traveling in three vehicles passed over it, the
communique said.
   The insurgents then opened fire on the patrol with automatic
weapons and rockets, killing 10 soldiers and injuring an
undetermined number, said the communique, read in a radio broadcast
by the Caracol network.
   The communique added that forces from the army's 7th Brigade
were still fighting the guerrillas who perpetrated the attack. San
Martin is 65 miles south of Bogota in Meta state.
   Founded about 30 years ago, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, with its estimated 5,000 armed rebels, is the oldest and
largest of Colombia's six main guerrilla groups.
   Another group, the April 19 Movment, said Saturday that it would
not lay down its weapons and accept a government amnesty this month
as originally planned.
   The movement cited as the reason for its decision Congress's
failure to approve key points of an official peace plan, which were
included in legislation to reform the country's constitution.
   The Senate shelved the legislation Dec. 14, after the House
attached a bill allowing a national vote on Colombia's extradition
of drug traffickers.
   The Senate apparently accepted President Virgilio Barco's
argument that the extradition referendum would lead to increased
terrorist violence by traffickers trying to pressure the public
into rejecting extradition.
   The shelving of the reform legislation was viewed as a victory
for the Barco administration's struggle against traffickers but a
blow to its efforts to make peace with the April 19 Movement and
other leftist groups.
   The legislation would have created a special electoral system
allowing the movement to elect members to Congress with fewer votes
than normally required. The group had demanded the concession in
return for its agreement to lay down its arms.
   A joint communique issued Saturday by the April 19 Movement's
leaders and government negotiators said the agreement has been
suspended but not discarded. ``Its contents are still valid, and
its negotiators have the responsibility to make it a reality,'' the
communique said.
   Both sides expressed ``the will to continue seeking dialogue and
negotiation.'' A new round of talks to save the pact is to begin in
January.

<HEAD>Fighting Rages Between Shiite Militias in South Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias backed by
Syria and Iran fought daylong tank and artillery battles in south
Lebanon on Saturday, killing at least 17 people and wounding 45,
police said.
   Most of the casualties reported were from the Syrian-backed Amal
movement, but police could not give a specific breakdown. Amal's
rival, the pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God,
appeared to have the upper hand in the fighting that began north of
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   At least six Shiite civilians, two of them children, were taken
to Beirut's American University Hospital with serious wounds, radio
stations reported.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said
First Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati left for
Damascus ``to settle the differences'' between Hezbollah and Amal.
   Meetings between representatives of both sides were held in
Sidon ``in a bid to stop the fighting and prevent more bloodshed,''
official sources said.
   It was the latest eruption in a 2-year-old power struggle
between Amal and Hezbollah for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Police were unsure what sparked the fighting, which torpedoed a
truce mediated by Syria and Iran that halted fighting between the
Shiite rivals last month.
   By police count, 588 people have been killed and 1,624 wounded
in Amal-Hezbollah battles that have raged intermittently since May
1987.
   An Amal official conceded that his movement's fighters had been
driven out of four villages in a surprise pre-dawn Hezbollah
assault.
   The official, who identified himself by his nom de guerre of Abu
Hassan Qobeissi, told The Associated Press at Amal's forward
command post outside the village of Kfar Hatta that the Hezbollah
forces attacked from their hill stronghold around the villages of
Jbaa and Ein Bouswar.
   The attackers overran four Amal-held villages, Kfar Hatta,
Mjaidel, Kfar Kila and Kfar Milki, he said.
   ``We were taken by surprise, but we're now counterattacking to
try to recapture the four villages,'' Qobeissi said as smoke from
burning buildings billowed into the sky.
   Police reported heavy fighting, with both sides using tanks,
mortars and rocket-propelled grenades around the contested villages.
   Hundreds of villagers fled toward Sidon, the provincial capital
of south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Immigration Reforms Said Falling Short, Causing Underclass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigration reform has freed more than 3 million
American residents from the label ``illegal alien,'' but Hispanic
activists say reform also has helped create a huge underclass ripe
for discrimination and exploitation by unscrupulous employers.
   The Immigration Reform and Control Act of late 1986 was supposed
to allow illegal aliens to enter the mainstream of American life
while also stemming the rising tide of illegal immigration across
the nation's southern border.
   Critics say the landmark legislation has only partially
succeeded in slowing the influx of aliens and has done little to
improve the lives of many alreading living here.
   Congress and the administration, these critics say, also have
turned their backs on a host of new problems.
   ``The '80s was a period of great promise that was never met; a
great promise that failed,'' said Dan Stein, executive director of
the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ``Americans looked
down the barrel of huge increases in immigration and failed to take
the steps needed to fix the system.''
   Hispanic rights organizations said the legislation, which bars
employers from hiring undocumented aliens, has created an
underclass of people desperate for jobs but vulnerable to employers
who pay subminimum wages and require workers to perform hazardous
tasks.
   At the same time, significant numbers of employers wary about
sanctions for breaking the new law are discriminating against
foreign-born or foreign-sounding job applicants, the activists
claim.
   And Congress and the administration have yet to make good on
their promise to increase the ranks of the Border Patrol by 50
percent. Before the bill's enactment there were 3,700 Border Patrol
agents; today there are 3,800 on duty, according to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   The Border Patrol also has been thrown into the war on drugs and
other missions that divert its attention from patrolling the
border, said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international
law.
   ``It was, overall, an enforcement failure,'' Stein said. ``The
INS and the Border Patrol have known what needs to be done yet the
administration has never put pressure on Congress to give us a
respectable level of border funding.''
   The reforms, however, appear to have succeeded _ at least
initially _ in slowing the number of aliens crossing the Southwest
border illegally.
   Apprehensions of these illegal aliens _ considered the best
indicator of illegal immigration _ fell from 1.6 million in the
year before the bill's passage to 854,939 in fiscal 1989.
Apprehensions, however, have begun creeping up again, officials say.
   The bill also has succeeded in touching the lives of 3.1 million
people who were in the country illegally prior to its passage, but
who are now eligible to become citizens through its amnesty
provisions.
   ``One in every 100 residents (of the country) has been
touched,'' said Michael Fix, a senior research associate at the
Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. ``The scale is stunning
and the kind of money spent and the impact on society over the long
run is just stunning. This is a one-time program of the size of the
war on poverty _ a big social deal and I don't think the dimensions
are really appreciated.''
   But activists say the amnesty provisions split families, with
one spouse allowed to remain here legally and another unqualified
to apply for residency. Immigration reformers complain that
Congress failed to prepare for the clamor of relatives who surely
will follow.
   ``The failure to reform legal immigration (which favors
legalization of family members of new residents) will mean
unprecedented political pressure to admit millions more immigrants
when there's not general public support for it,'' Stein said.
   But Mario Moreno, director of the Washington office of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Congress
could have helped far more people achieve residency through more
liberal amnesty standards.
   At the same time, those who don't qualify are ``outside the loop
of any sort of safety net,'' he said. ``There have been reports of
people being taken advantage of, of being exploited.''
   Some have taken such hazardous jobs as improperly managed
asbestos removal or working with toxic wastes, Moreno said.
   Jose Garcia De Lara, national president of the League of United
Latin American Citizens, said he has heard of illegal aliens doing
hazardous construction or agricultural work, or being forced into
crime.
   ``They're certainly an unprotected people,'' he said, and as
long as there is political and economic turmoil to the south of the
Rio Grande, Mexicans, Central and South Americans will continue to
try to enter the country illegally.
   ``Congress passed the bill and turned its back,'' De Lara said.
``Congress should roll up its sleeves and do a major overhaul of
IRCA and include an initiative to help the countries south of our
border.''
   Added Moreno: ``The unabated flow of aliens is not going to be
stopped by employer sanctions.''
   Activists complain those sanctions, however, are responsible for
employer discrimination against foreign-looking and
foreign-sounding job seekers.
   ``It's a very real, powerful problem,'' said Fix. ``While it may
be IRCA related, it's not just an IRCA problem. A lot of
discrimination predated IRCA.''
   De Lara said the Office of Special Counsel within the Justice
Department has done ``almost nil'' to enforce the law's
anti-discrimination provisions.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, a member of the immigration
subcommittee, agreed the administration has ``refused to take
seriously the obligation to enforce the anti-discrimination
provisions in the bill. They don't have the people to enforce it.''
   But Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on the
immigration panel, said he's seen little evidence of discrimination.
   ``There have only been a dozen or so proven cases of
discrimination because of employer sanctions and this despite the
fact that a number of organizations have spent a lot of time trying
to come up with examples of discrimination,'' said Smith.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis also said discrimination does not
appear to be severe.
   Enforcement of employer sanctions, however, has fallen short in
Smith's view.
   ``Until we vigorously enforce employer sanctions, we are not
going to significantly stem the flood of illegal aliens entering
the United States. I'm hoping we will see more enforcement, and the
imposition of more penalties, in the future,'' Smith said.

   Two weeks ago hundreds of people
gathered around a large TV to watch their neighborhood hero,
Roberto Duran, fight American boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and make the
kind of money they cannot even dream of.
   Last week, they watched another fight on the streets of El
Chorrillo as the invading Americans attacked Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's headquarters nearby. Many were killed or wounded;
thousands lost their homes.
   On Dec. 7 they sat on the ground to watch the match on a large
screen set up on a flatbed truck provided by Gustavo Torreclosa, El
Chorrillo's representative to Noriega's rump national legislature.
   ``Stonehands'' Duran lost, but the people of El Chorrillo were
philosophical about it. Leonard dominated the fight, but their El
Chorrillo-born hero had held several world championships. He'd had
his day.
   El Chorrillo had 28,000 residents, mostly black and poor. Every
Friday night was an outdoor party of music and dancing, with fresh
fried fish and beer sold on the sidewalk. The beer was cheap _ it
usually ``fell off a truck'' down at the Balboa docks.
   Petty crime was a danger, and there were plenty of
``maleantes,'' or hoods, and those who tried to act like hoods.
   The barrio was right next to Noriega's headquarters. Wednesday
morning, U.S. cannon fire and swept across the neighborhood for
hours as troops moved in to try to capture the general.
   The general is gone, but so is El Chorrillo.
   The wooden structures, dating back to the late 1800s and early
1900s, burned like tinder under the shattering cannonade. The fire
lit the sky through the night and sent a pall of smoke across the
city throughout the next day.
   Buildings that were home to thousands were reduced to a frieze
of charred sticks.
   Hundreds were wounded and more than a hundred were dead,
according to doctors at Santo Tomas Hospital, a mile down the
shore. Torreclosa was among the first victims. Everyone who was not
wounded or killed left. Many were dazed, many were unable to take
out even a single possession.
   ``We tried to avoid civilian casualties,'' said a U.S. soldier
who had been there the night of the attack. He refused to give his
name.
   On Saturday, the area was still off limits. U.S. tanks and
soldiers patrolled the streets with loudspeakers warning everyone
to stay away.
   ``Why did they do this?'' a resident asked, looking at the
rubble that had been his building 200 yards away. ``Just because
they wanted to get Noriega?''

   After an all-night vigil in the Pentagon ``war
room'' as last week's Panama invasion began, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell emerged at 7:45 a.m. to explain the
still-unfolding operation.
   Standing before a packed room of reporters and cameras, Cheney
laid out the reasoning behind President Bush's decision and then
stood aside to watch the youngest-ever chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff provide a half-hour, detailed breakdown of the most
massive military operation since the Vietnam War.
   Speaking at length without notes about the complex influx of
soldiers and their varied missions, Powell made sure to offer the
cameras a ``sound bite,'' colorfully pronouncing Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's supporters ``thugs and rabble rousers'' and
declaring, ``This reign of terror is over.''
   Even though the deposed dictator had eluded his military
opponents, the 52-year-old Powell vowed, ``We will chase him and we
will find him.''
   ``It's been some years since Mr. Noriega ... has been living in
the jungle. ... I'm not quite sure he's up to being chased around
the countryside by Army Rangers, Special Forces and Light Infantry
Units,'' the four-star general said.
   Powell, the first black to hold the post as the nation's highest
military officer, had shied away from media attention during his
first four months as the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, telling
his associates, ``I need to get to know my job.''
   Then at Bush's order he organized the shipment of 26,000 troops
into Panama _ and the spotlight couldn't have been more intense.
   By all accounts, Powell has won the applause of his Pentagon
colleagues.
   The praise has been so constant, in fact, that when a senior
Pentagon official was asked to say something negative about the
four-star general, the civilian jokingly replied, ``He's Army.''
   Powell has appeared a bit weary and puffy-faced in recent days
as he has met with reporters _ usually with Cheney at his side _ to
explain the military action that toppled Noriega from power.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who has sat in on many of
Cheney's meetings with Powell, says the general ``has a good public
relations sense.'' Powell honed those skills as the top military
aide to one-time Pentagon chief Caspar Weinberger, and during his
White House years as the deputy national security adviser to Frank
Carlucci, whose post he later held.
   The chairman ``has been good about letting his staff speak,''
Williams said, pointing to the near-daily briefings held by Lt.
Gen. Tom Kelly, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs and
Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, the JCS chief of intelligence.
   But Williams said that when the general ``makes a decision,
that's it, he's unequivocal.
   ``He doesn't let things get out of hand,'' Williams said,
adding, ``I don't think I've ever heard him yell _ let alone raise
his voice.''
   Powell is regarded among his fellows as thoughtful and precise,
as well as an officer who shows little favoritism toward his own
branch of service, the Army.
   ``Colin not only is smart, he thinks smart,'' said a senior Navy
official. ``He may be career Army, but he is the least biased
toward his own service than anybody I know.''
   Powell was born in New York City, the son of Jamaican
immigrants. He distinguished himself as the best infantry
instructor at Fort Benning, Ga., in the mid-1960s and won a bronze
star and purple heart in Vietnam.
   He became a White House fellow and later became Weinberger's
senior military assistant.
   Powell was chosen for the nation's highest military post by Bush
this fall, shortly after he had been put in charge of Forces
Command at Fort McPherson, Ga., overseeing the nation's 1 million
U.S.-based troops.
   The president, impressed with Powell during their frequent White
House contacts, picked Powell over many other military men with
broader military experience and advanced age.
   The chairman played a major role in urging Bush and the Joint
Chiefs to adopt the maximum military option for dealing with the
Panamanian situation, one longtime Pentagon official said.
   ``He really has switched roles,'' the Powell acquaintance said,
noting that Powell in his National Security Council days was loathe
to take up State Department demands for more military involvement
in Central America.
   The break-point in the administration's approach to Noriega came
after the shooting of an unarmed Marine last Saturday, and Powell
began preparing to offer the president a range of military options
shortly thereafter, one of the senior Pentagon official's said.
   ``He was in on it from the very first,'' the official said.

   Mobs also massed in the streets of Bucharest
20 years ago. But unlike the determined throngs now dismantling
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu's dictatorship, the crowds of
1969 were dancing in praise of Ceausescu _ and his American
visitor, President Richard Nixon.
   ``At one point, Ceausescu and I were literally swept up by the
dancing in the streets,'' Nixon recalled in his memoirs.
   Soon after his first inauguration, Nixon undertook a politically
daring visit to Bucharest. He became the first U.S. president to
visit a Soviet satellite capital, hoping ``to needle the Soviets,''
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger recalled in his
autobiographical ``White House Years.''
   Early in his quarter-century reign, Ceausescu attracted the
attention of U.S. strategists with his effort to pursue a foreign
policy independent from Moscow.
   He kept Romania in the Warsaw Pact and ran a typically tough
domestic regime. But unlike other Warsaw Pact members, he did not
break relations with Israel after the 1967 Mideast War, he pursued
a strong relationship with China and he criticized the Pact's 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Both Nixon and Kissinger said later that Ceausescu helped
provide a channel for diplomatic communications to Chinese leaders
before the United States had official relations with the mainland.
   Ceausescu kindled Nixon's interest when the future president
visited Bucharest as a private tourist in 1967 expecting a routine
reception. Nixon recalled in his memoirs that Ceausescu surprised
him with a grand welcome and ``Everywhere we were greeted with
outbursts of friendship from the people.''
   Nixon wrote that he told Ceausescu of his desire to normalize
U.S. relations with mainland China, planting the seeds of what
Nixon later called the ``Romanian channel'' in approaches to
Beijing and North Vietnam.
   After his 1969 inauguration, Nixon included Romania on his
round-the-world trip and recalled in his memoirs, ``When we landed
in Bucharest Aug. 2, I became the first American president to make
a state visit to a communist satellite country.
   ``President Nicolae Ceausescu is a strong, independent leader
who had cultivated good relations with the Chinese in spite of the
fact that he had to walk a very fine line lest the Soviets decide
to intervene in Romania as they had in Hungary in 1956 and in
Czechoslovakia in 1968. So far he had walked that line with
consummate skill.''
   Nixon said Ceausescu also agreed to do everything possible to
help U.S. negotiations with Hanoi to bring peace to Indochina.
   Nixon brought Ceausescu to Washington for a state visit in
October 1970, and said in his memoirs that the visit marked the
start of the ``Romanian channel'' to Beijing.
   Nixon recalled that the Romanian channel was used in 1971 when
Ceausescu's Washington ambassador conveyed a message from Premier
Chou En-lai saying ``in view of the fact I had visited Bucharest in
1969 and Belgrade in 1970, I would be welcome in Peking.'' Nixon
made his historic first visit to China in 1972, after two
exploratory missions by Kissinger.
   Kissinger wrote that Nixon visited Bucharest in 1969 to repay
Ceausescu's courtesies of 1967, ``but his principal reason was to
needle the Soviets.''
   Nixon used Ceausescu's 1970 Washington visit ``for a public step
forward'' in the feelers to China, Kissinger said. In a White House
toast to Ceausescu, ``Nixon toasted the many common interests of
the United States and Romania, listing prominently that of good
relations, such as Romania had, with the United States, the Soviet
Union and the `Peoples Republic of China.' It was the first use of
China's official name by an American president,'' Kissinger said.

   Iranian newspapers on Saturday criticized
last week's official visit of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu,
who was later ousted in a popular revolution.
   The daily Ettela'at said the visit provided an opportunity for
international news media to defame Iran, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   ``The Foreign Ministry would do well to offer some explanation
why it arranged for Ceausescu to visit Tehran at an inopportune
time when his ouster was not something difficult to guess,'' it
said.
   The English-language Tehran times joined in the criticism by
writing: ``The nagging question is why should he be received in our
capital while a whole nation has risen up against his rule?''
   ``How can the Iranian nation, which made one of the most
vigorous revolutions against an armed-to-the-teeth dictator, not
share the sentiment of the Romanian people standing up to an
autocratic rule?'' it added. ``The Romanian nation's victory is a
triumph of all nations.''
   The newspaper's editorial, to be published in Sunday's issue,
was quoted in advance by IRNA.
   The staff of the Romanian Embassy in Tehran on Saturday declared
its support for the uprising in Bucharest and for the new National
Salvation Committee, the news agency quoted Ambassador Ilie Sisu as
saying.
   During his visit to Iran that ended Wednesday, Ceausescu signed
a deal under which Iran would export 41 million barrels of oil and
1 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year to Romania.
   Ceausescu, 71, also visited the tomb of the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini in a near-obligatory stop for foreign dignitaries.
   The Times of London reported Saturday that Iranian leaders had
difficulty persuading Ceausescu to visit the tomb at the Behesht
Zahra cemetery outside Tehran.
   Ettela'at criticized the large number of Ceausescu relatives he
installed in high places in the Romanian government. It also
blasted his role in facilitating contacts between former Egyptian
and Israeli leaders Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin.
   ``Let us hope Ceausescu was the last falling star to come to the
Islamic Republic for his last meal,'' the newspaper wrote.
   ``Let us respect the will of the people of Romania. The
inopportune visit to Tehran by Ceausescu may be made good by
saluting the struggle of the Romanian people.''
   The daily, generally considered pro-government and supportive of
the private sector, said an Iranian student was among the hundreds
of demonstrators killed in the western Romanian city of Timisoara
while Ceausescu was in Tehran.
   Romania is Iran's second-biggest trading partner in Eastern
Europe, with the volume of trade estimated at about $1.8 billion.
The new agreements, if they remain in place, would boost that to $3
billion a year.

   Deposed Communist leader Nicolae
Ceausescu ran Romania with a tightly run clan that included an
estimated 40 members of his family in positions of power.
   Soon after he assumed power March 22, 1965, Ceausescu did what
other hard-line Communist leaders did to establish and cement
authority: he brought his own followers into the party's top
echelons.
   But his unlimited ambitions and mistrust of his minions prompted
him to place family members in lead positions.
   Ceausescu's wife, Elena, a Politburo member and first deputy
premier, was the second most powerful figure in both the party and
state hierarchy.
   One of his brothers, Ilie, was an army general and deputy
defense minister. Another brother, Nicolae Andruta, was a police
general and deputy interior minister.
   Another brother, Ion, was responsible for state economic
planning. Among other brothers, Marin was a diplomat and Florea an
editor with the Communist Party newspaper Scinteia.
   Ceausescu's brother-in-law, Vasile Barbulescu, was a party
secretary in charge of agriculture, and Gheorghe Petrescu, Elena's
brother, was in charge of the trade unions.
   Ceausescu's youngest son, Nicu, 39, was reportedly a womanizer
and a heavy drinker, reputed for his passion for Western sports
cars and hunting parties. He was linked romantically at one time to
Romanian gymnastics star Nadia Comaneci, who defected to the United
States on Nov. 28.
   Nicu, nicknamed the ``Crown Prince,'' was party secretary in the
Sibiu county in southern Transylvania, home to a powerful military
and security garrison.
   He was also known to have killed at least two people in traffic
accidents, when he ran through red lights.
   Nicu was known as a gambler, who at one time lost $1 million in
one night alone playing roulette in a Las Vegas casino, Romanian
officials said.
   Nicu's wife, Poliana, was chairwoman of the Pioneers' National
Council, the Romanian equivalent of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.
   One of Ceausescu's other sons, Valentin, was a leading nuclear
researcher and his daughter, Zoia Elena, led the Institute of
Mathematics in Romania's capital.
   Scores of other more distant members of the clan occupied
positions in security, trade and agriculture.
   ``He was worse than Stalin, who wished to institute socialism in
one country. Ceausescu's slogan was socialism in just one family,''
said Romanian writer Dan Petrescu, a dissident writer.

   Israeli paratroopers
ordered holiday shoppers home Saturday after a clash with Arab
stonethrowers. South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu declared his
support for a Palestinian state.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, troops opened fire on masked
stonethrowers, killing two and wounding 12, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed that one Arab youth was killed and said the
military was investigating the reports of a second death.
   The deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the
two-year uprising against Israeli occupation to 639. Forty Israelis
also have died in the violence and Palestinians have killed at
least 161 Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   Arab reporters identified the dead youths as Mohammed Zakaria
el-Hourani, 22, and Aymad Mohammed al-Atrash, 17. Hospital
officials reported that 21 Palestinians were wounded in scattered
clashes with troops throughout Gaza.
   In Bethlehem, masked youths burned tires and hurled stones at
army patrols near the Church of the Nativity. The site marks the
manger where tradition holds that Jesus was born.
   Troops shot bursts of fire from their automatic weapons into the
air to disperse the youths and fired tear gas into alleyways of the
nearby marketplace where they fled.
   Red-bereted paratroopers and purple-bereted troops from the
elite Givati brigade ran through the marketplace shouting ``ruhi
el-beit,'' Arabic for ``go home,'' at holiday shoppers.
   One enraged shopper turned to a soldier and said: ``You can't
close the shops, this is our holiday,'' but the soldier ordered her
home.
   The troops also confiscated identity cards from Palestinians and
refused to return them until the Arabs removed barricades from the
streets and swept up debris from burning tires.
   Slogans were spray-painted on walls throughout the town urging
renewed clashes with troops Christmas Day.
   In Jerusalem, Tutu joined Moslem leaders and activists and bowed
his head in silent prayer at a memorial to the almost 600
Palestinians slain in 1982 by Israeli-backed Christian militiamen
in Lebanon's Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
   ``We support the struggle of the Palestinian people in their
longing for statehood and independence,'' Tutu told nearly 30
Palestinian dignitaries. ``We are struggling for our own
self-determination in South Africa.''
   ``We pray that the day will come soon when a Palestinian state
will exist side-by-side with a Jewish state and Arab and Jew will
hold hands together,'' said Tutu, who arrived Friday for a five-day
visit.

   At an age when many people are slowing
down to enjoy their golden years, 70-year-old Ellen Ahlgren is busy
heading an international drive to help babies afflicted with AIDS.
   Ahlgren runs an organization called ABC Quilts _ AIDS Baby Crib
Quilts _ whose members make and distribute small quilts to babies
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. So far, they've made
nearly 1,300.
   ``When you can't do anything, it's depressing,'' she said.
``When you can, it's a very good feeling.
   In 18 months, ABC Quilts has grown from a contingent known as
``Ellen's Elves,'' who worked out of her living room, to a network
of hundreds of quilters in 44 states and several countries,
including Japan, Australia and England. The project is supported
solely through donations.
   The quilters use original patterns and designs, and each quilt
has a patch that reads ``Love and comfort to you'' and has the name
and city of its maker.
   Most are sent to Ahlgren's home which has become a sort of
command center, with maps, tables and papers, not to mention
quilts, cluttering the living room waiting for distribution.
   ``Every day is like Christmas here,'' Ahlgren said in a recent
interview. ``There's always boxes being opened.''
   Ahlgren contacts hospitals across the country to see where
quilts are wanted and sends them off to places like New York City,
Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and Washington, D.C.
   Those cities are a far cry from Ahlgren's rural home, located
about 60 miles north of Boston in a town with 2,400 residents. From
her kitchen is a view of a snowy field and thick woods.
   It's a much different setting from the impoverished and
depressing surroundings where many of the AIDS babies live.
   ``A baby's a baby no matter where they're sick,'' she said.
   Though she realizes the babies she is helping probably won't
live long, it doesn't discourage her.
   ``This (project) taps into a tremendous energy of love,
compassion, generosity. It raises the awareness of people and helps
them learn about this horrible epidemic.... It's not just
statistics.''
   Ahlgren, a mental health counselor who worked at a hospice
before retiring, launched the quilt project after reading an
article about AIDS babies.
   ``I had made about 20 quilts for my own family and had seen how
much they enjoyed them, so I put two and two together,'' said
Ahlgren, who has five children and nine grandchildren.
   Ahlgren said she and some of her relatives and quilting friends
made fliers outlining the project and asking for help. They posted
them in various towns in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Then an
article about the fledgling group appeared in a national quilting
magazine.
   ``I had been on vacation and when I returned, there were 360
letters waiting for me,'' she said.
   Since then, nearly 1,300 quilts have been made and distributed.
Ahlgren's goal is to pass out 10,000 by 1991, a number that would
equal the projected number of AIDS babies.
   Ahlgren likes to tell a story about a 2-year-old AIDS baby from
Philadelphia. Nurses said all the infant did for most of the day
was cry _ until they gave him an ABC Quilt.
   ``He reached out and hugged it and went to sleep,'' Ahlgren
said, smiling.

   Here is a brief summary of events Saturday in Panama:
   _2,000 U.S. soldiers arrived to reinforce the 24,000 American
soldiers already in Panama. Troops met unexpectedly stiff
resistance by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   _Panama's President Guillermo Endara named a Cabinet but
declined to reveal their names because the security situation was
so serious.
   _U.S. authorities said they had seized more than 13,000 weapons.
   _Panama's bishops conference urged that ``the U.S. military
action end as soon as possible.''
   _Nicaraguan troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Managua again
in an effort to force U.S. soldiers searching for Noriega to end
their blockade of Nicaragua's Embassy in Panama. U.S. troops
continued to surround the Nicaraguan, Cuban and Libyan embassies in
Panama City.
   _U.S. authorities said prisoners at an island penitentiary in
the Pacific apparently overcame their pro-Noriega guards and
radioed for help from American forces. The prison group was said to
include some of the former Panamanian officers who led a failed
coup Oct. 3.
   _The Pentagon said 24 American soldiers and 139 Panamanian
soldiers have been killed. It reported 222 Americans and 95
Panamanians wounded, and two American soldiers and one civilian
missing. Two civilian U.S. dependents were killed and 1,663
Panamanians detained.

   The red-brick rowhouse is still standing where
little Virginia O'Hanlon lived, where she penned the letter nearly
a century ago that implored a newspaper editor to tell her the
truth: Does Santa Claus exist?
   But no one lives at 115 W. 95th St. anymore. And Santa Claus
would find no stockings hung by the chimney with care. He would
find boarded-up windows, a gutted interior and a flock of pigeons.
   In a neighborhood that has had hard times, only to rebound into
affluence _ in a city that cries out for housing _ the vacancy of
Virginia O'Hanlon's four-story house and five others on the street
has caused controversy.
   Virginia is all but forgotten in the dispute.
   But at least one person remembers. Last Christmas, someone
pinned an unsigned Christmas card on the door, along with a
clipping from a newspaper that reprinted Virginia's letter and the
response.
   ``Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?'' Virginia
wrote. She was 8 years old, and some of her classmates were
skeptics.
   In an editorial published on Sept. 21, 1897, in the New York
Sun, Francis Pharcellus Church replied: ``Yes Virginia, there is a
Santa Claus.''
   ``He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion
exist ...,'' Church said. ``How dreary would be the world if there
were no Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no
Virginias.''
   Virginia O'Hanlon Douglas died on May 13, 1971. A decade
earlier, she had reaffirmed her belief in the Santa Claus spirit,
saying it ``stands for love and sharing, the joy of giving and the
extension of it to all people.''
   But at the time of her death, her childhood home already had
been vacant for about five years, recalls Jeanne L. Beatty,
president of the West 95th Street Development Corp., which holds
the house's title.
   And now Santa himself probably couldn't find Virginia's house _
the street numbers are missing. Chicken wire blocks the entrance.
   Someone has scrawled ``AIDS Housing Now'' in red on the door.
Not long ago, a human body was drawn on the sidewalk out front,
with the caption: ``Homeless people are freezing to death and this
building stands vacant.''
   The non-profit West 95th corporation developed five houses on
the street and was supposed to arrange the refurbishing and
development of six others, including Virginia's home, which was to
hold five families.
   But the corporation instead became involved in a legal snarl in
which the city and neighbors are trying to get back the houses,
claiming Ms. Beatty is holding the property until prices rise. She
says the legal battle has prevented her from refurbishing the
buildings.
   The fight has dragged on for more than a decade.
   ``For the last 10 years, the corporation has acted in a totally
illegal manner by having no board of directors, no bylaws, no
annual meetings, or any other kind of control beyond the one-woman
control of Jeanne Beatty,'' lawyer and neighbor Lawrence J. Gross
charged in a letter to the state attorney general's office.
   He estimated the six buildings, once worth about $20,000 apiece,
could now bring several million dollars.
   But Ms. Beatty says she's no Scrooge.
   ``My money is sitting there and has been carrying all of this.
I'm the one who's been going through all the stress. It has impeded
my health and career. It's been bleeding me, frankly. The money I'd
been making in real estate is gone,'' she said.
   Ms. Beatty said the buildings must be totally refurbished except
for walls and ceilings.
   Much has changed since Virginia wrote her letter, but Ms. Beatty
insisted the Christmas spirit lives on West 95th Street.
   ``It's in mourning really,'' she said. ``Perhaps I should put a
wreath on the door this year. We hope in 1990 it will be occupied
and lights on again in the window and laughter and cheer for the
next holiday. And carolers can stop by.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Inbred Ideas About Murder Determined Bus Crash Verdict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special prosecutor said he was up
against deeply instilled ideas about what is murder when he failed
to persuade a jury that the man who caused a bus crash that killed
27 people deserved life in prison.
   Larry Mahoney, a 36-year-old chemical plant worker, was
convicted Thursday of manslaughter, assault, wanton endangerment
and drunken driving. His jury recommended a 16-year prison sentence.
   The verdict came 19 months after Mahoney, driving drunk and on
the wrong side of Interstate 71, ran his pickup into the front of a
church bus loaded with youngsters on a church outing.
   The impact knocked off the bus' front axle, the gas tank was
punctured, and a fuel fire exploded into the bus' interior, killing
24 children and three adults. Forty people escaped, but 12 children
suffered disfiguring burns.
   Kentucky authorities have been empowered to charge drunken
drivers with murder since the late 1970s. But convictions are rare,
requiring a jury to find that a defendant acted wantonly, with
``extreme indifference'' to human life.
   In the Mahoney case, the murder charge didn't stick even though
the tragedy was compounded by the innocence of the victims and the
horrible way they died.
   Prosecutors must overcome ``a deep-seated, in-bred public
perception of what is murder,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Paul Richwalsky, who prosecuted Mahoney.
   ``Maybe if this crime was called anything else _ vehicular
homicide, or somehow the label `murder' was not attached to it _
the results may have been different,'' he said.
   Though it would have been of great symbolic significance, a
murder conviction probably would have had little real effect on
Mahoney's sentence, Richwalsky said.
   Mahoney's most serious conviction was for first-degree assault,
punishable by 10 to 20 years in prison. The jury recommended a
dozen 16-year sentences and the maximum 10 years on each of 27
counts of second-degree manslaughter. But it also ordered all the
sentences to run concurrently.
   The assault conviction made Mahoney a ``violent offender'' under
Kentucky law, meaning he must serve half his sentence _ eight years
_ before he can be considered for parole.
   A murder conviction, with a minimum 20-year sentence, would have
made Mahoney eligible for parole in 10 years.
   The jury's decisions nevertheless outraged relatives of many of
the crash victims, who said they had been denied even a hollow
victory.
   Janet Kytta had wanted ``just the word `murder''' from the jury.
   ``It was not manslaughter; it was murder,'' she said.
   Her husband, Chuck Kytta, was youth director for the church,
Radcliff First Assembly of God, and had arranged the youngsters'
outing to an amusement park.
   Kytta was standing at the bus' front door, and must have been
killed by fire before he could have passed out from smoke, Dr.
George Nichols, the state's chief medical examiner, testified.

   Mikhail Gorbachev, whose political and economic
reforms in the Soviet Union sparked a revolution that shattered
communist control of Eastern Europe, was named Man of the Decade by
Time magazine Saturday.
   The Soviet president, previously named Time's Man of the Year in
1987, was chosen because he is ``the force behind the most
momentous events of the '80s and because what he has already done
will almost certainly shape the future,'' Time said.
   The only precedent for such a choice by the magazine was its
selection of Winston Churchill as Man of the Half-Century in 1949.
   ``This year, as world attention ricocheted from the stirrings of
democracy in the U.S.S.R. to the massacre in Beijing and the
peaceful revolts in Eastern Europe, it became clear that we were
witnessing a sequence of events that began well before 1989 and
whose impact would extend into the next decade, perhaps the next
century,'' the magazine said.
   ``Somehow confining our choice to 1989 seemed inadequate, and
thus we named Gorbachev Man of the Decade.''
   The magazine said he ``has accelerated history, making possible
the end of one of its most disreputable episodes, the imposition of
a cruel and unnatural order on hundreds of millions of people.''
   Gorbachev becomes only the fourth non-American designated twice
by the magazine. One was Churchill (1940 and 1949); the others were
Soviet leader Josef Stalin (1939 and 1942) and China's Deng
Xiaoping (1978 and 1985).
   Time has been naming a Man of the Year since 1927, choosing the
``person who, for better or worse, has had the most impact on the
year's events.'' The first award went to aviator Charles Lindbergh;
last year's winner was Earth as planet of the year.

<TEXT>
   A group of Panamanian prisoners,
including a military officer involved in the ill-fated coup in
October, took over an island penitentiary and asked for help from
the United States, U.S. military officials said Saturday.
   The prison, which had been run by loyalists to Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, is on an island off Panama's Pacific coast about
60 miles from the capital.
   U.S. officials said the prisoner revolt was led by a man
identified only as ``Major Pajaro'' who was said to be one of the
leaders of the unsuccessful coup against Noriega on Oct. 3.
   No other details of the prison revolt were available.
   Meanwhile, U.S. military officials said small bands of Noriega
supporters were continuing harassing attacks in the capital.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said the hit-and-run Noriega loyalists are ``increasing
their activities of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar
fire, threatening the civilian population, and hostage-taking.''
   When pressed for specific numbers, Marguila replied ``I don't
have in my mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday
of dignity-battalion efforts. It's just that they are becoming more
of a concern, because they are taking more of our time as opposed
to the PDF (Panama Defense Force).''
   Marguila said the task of the U.S. troops is turning from
conventional warfare to counterterrorism and police duties.
   The U.S. military spokesman said ``armed bandits'' continue to
roam many parts of Panama City and that looting has moved from
shopping districts into some upperclass residential neighborhoods
where residents have been arming themselves.
   Marguila said that with the neutralizing of the PDF by the U.S.
military the country is without an adequate police force to deal
with the lawlessness.
   ``The PDF was involved in just about every nook and cranny of
the government. Since that element is gone, there is a void and a
gap, especially in the police force ... and that is something we
need to rebuild,'' the spokesman said.

   Here is a brief summary of events Saturday in Romania:
   _Revolutionary leaders announce the capture of President Nicolae
Ceausescu, his wife, Elena, who is the deputy premier, and the
third ranking leader, Emil Bobu. The new provisional government
said they will be put on trial.
   _The revolutionaries say they control the country, but sporadic
fighting continues. Skirmishes continue in the capital between army
units siding with pro-reform protesters and security forces loyal
to the deposed Ceausescu. Much of the fighting appears to be
guerrilla warfare by loyalist forces desperate to avoid capture.
   _Anti-Ceausescu forces catch and kill loyalists on the spot. An
AP reporter witnesses summary executions near the Bucharest post
office.
   _The Soviet Union, the International Red Cross, Britain, France,
Sweden and numerous other nations announce plans to ship crucial
medical and food supplies to the embattled nation. But they report
difficulty in bypassing blockades at the border.
   _Romanian embassies worldwide shift their allegiances to the new
government. Diplomatic missions in Washington, Iran, the
Netherlands, Libya, the Soviet Union, Jordan, Sweden, Turkey,
Greece, Poland, Sudan and many others announce support for the new
leadership.
   _Citizens waving flags and cheering the revolution venture out
into the streets, despite the fighting. Taxis are commandeered to
carry bodies in Bucharest, and residents carry knives and sharp
sticks to defend against attacks by pro-Ceausescu forces in the
city of Timisoara.

<TEXT>
   The Christmas weekend cold snap has stretched
the nation's energy system to the maximum and created ``spot
shortages'' of heating fuels in some areas, the Energy Department's
chief of emergency preparedness said Saturday.
   ``At the moment we think we can get through this abnormally cold
weather,'' without widespread energy shortages, but the outlook
could darken if refineries break down or other unforeseen problems
develop, said John J. Easton Jr.
   Easton, the assistant energy secretary for international affairs
and energy emergencies, said the government was not considering
imposing any price or allocation controls.
   Easton spoke to reporters at Energy Department headquarters
during a break in a day-long meeting with about 80 representatives
of oil companies, electric utilities, natural gas distributors,
state energy offices and other federal departments.
   The meeting was called Thursday to exchange information about
localized distribution problems and to consider easing federal
rules affecting energy transportation. Easton said, for example,
that the Department of Transportation was waiving certain limits on
working hours by fuel truck drivers.
   The Energy Department has begun processing applications for
waivers of the Jones Act, which prohibits the use of foreign ships
to carry U.S. oil products in domestic waters, Easton said, adding
that some exceptions could be granted so that foreign ships heading
overseas with U.S. fuel products could reverse course to U.S. ports.
   Easton said the main problem in heating fuels as of Saturday
afternoon was distribution of propane.
   ``In propane there are spot shortages, and it will be tight for
the next 10 days or so,'' he said. Later he said these shortages
were ``in many parts of the country,'' mainly the Northeast and
Midwest.
   Easton said the department wanted to reassure the public that
``the federal government is concerned'' about the hardships posed
by heating fuel shortages, and that it is actively trying to ``cut
the red tape to relieve the bottlenecks.''
   ``This is not an emergency,'' Easton said, stressing that
supplies of heating oil and natural gas as of Saturday were
adequate, although refineries were operating at maximum capacity to
meet ``unprecedented demand'' for heating fuels.
   ``We do not expect any shortages in natural gas, although I can
say the system is producing at the maximum at the present time,''
Easton said. He said some parts of Texas were experiencing
``rotating blackouts'' due to electricity shortages but that power
supplies in most areas were generally adequate.
   Easton said the meeting was told by a National Weather Service
official that extreme cold weather was expected to continue at
least through the end of December in the Northeast but that some
relief was likely soon for other regions. The January outlook was
for abnormal cold in the north central states but less harsh
conditions elsewhere, he said.

   Panama's new president said Saturday
he had only three hours warning of the U.S. attack that toppled
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and has been scrambling ever since
because his government had to ``start from point zero.''
   President Guillermo Endara said in an interview that the news of
the U.S. invasion at midnight Tuesday was ``like a kick in the
head. It was not the best thing I would have thought.''
   ``We were not really consulted,'' said Endara, who said he was
``very diplomatically'' told of President Bush's plans only two or
three hours before it was launched.
   Endara said Saturday he had named a Cabinet but was not making
the names public yet to protect its members. One of Endara's vice
presidents, Ricardo Arias Calderon, survived an assassination
attempt Friday.
   ``We are keeping them confidential, but they will be announced
soon,'' Endara told a group of reporters.
   Endara and his two vice presidents were sworn in one day after
the U.S. invasion. They assumed office Friday.
   A few hours later, fighters loyal to Noriega raked Arias' car,
wounding two of his bodyguards.
   ``It is a shaky government. I took over a government of a
country invaded by another country. There was total anarchy. This
is the first time a government has to start from point zero. But we
are working hard,'' Endara said.
   Endara said he was trying to get one of Panama City's two
airports open to allow food and medicine to be flown in.
   Endara said his government is also trying to organize a police
force to replace the one that fell apart with Noriega's downfall,
setting off a massive looting spree.
   ``We swore in the first 20 members (of the force) yesterday,''
he added. The new force will be commanded by Col. Roberto Armijo, a
former Noriega loyalist who switched sides.
   Asked how he felt about the American invasion, Endara replied:
``I have lots of work to do. I have no time to think about the bad
things. Noriega destroyed everything when he fell. Everything was
back to zero.''
   ``I would have been happier without an intervention. I could
have gone into a depression over the invasion,'' he said.
   ``I probably would have worked out some details in advance, like
the matter of public order,'' he added.
   But he said he could work with the Americans.
   ``The gringos have their defects, but I am used to ... them. I
wish it would have been different, but we have to work with what we
have,'' Endara said.
   He denied reports that he was sworn in before a judge at a U.S.
military base.
   ``I was sworn in on Panamanian territory, in a Panamanian home
after 1 a.m. Then in the morning we went to (the U.S. military base
at) Fort Clayton,'' he said.
   Endara and vice presidential candidates Arias and Guillermo Ford
were elected by a landslide in May 7 elections, according to U.S.
and other foreign observers. Noriega declared the election void.
   All three were scheduled to have been sworn in Sept. 1, but
instead Noriega named a provisional president and ended up having
himself elevated to ``chief of government'' before the U.S. attack.
   ``Everybody would be more at ease if Noriega were in custody,
but Noriega is not essential now. He is out of power forever. He is
not so popular among the people,'' Endara said.
   ``He never was. People are sad because of the price they had to
pay for (all) this,'' he added.

   The hockey mask worn by masked movie murderer
Jason in the horror film ``Friday the 13th'' and stolen from
director John Waters' porch was found in a mailbox after police
received a tip Saturday.
   Waters didn't direct Friday the 13th, but was given the mask by
Nick Mancuso, the executive producer of the horror film. The mask
was taken last week from the front porch of Waters' home, where a
deliveryman had left it.
   Waters, who directed cult movie hits such as ``Hairspray'' that
featured the late female impersonator Divine, had planned to give
the hockey mask to an old friend for Christmas.
   An anonymous caller phoned police Saturday, and said a
``precious item'' was in a mailbox in north Baltimore. The mailbox
was opened and the missing mask was found in a brown paper bag
addressed to Waters, police said.
   ``I asked him what kind of `precious item' and he said it was
the John Waters mask,'' police officer Julie Morgan said.

<HEAD>Mother of Bundy Victim Says She's Finding Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOUNTIFUL, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Christmas is the first in 15 years
that Belva Kent has been at peace. The irony does not escape her
that it was serial killer Ted Bundy who made the respite possible.
   Just before his Jan. 24 execution in Florida, Bundy confessed to
having killed her 17-year-old daughter, Debra, and at least 22
other young women in the 1970s. The condemned man also indicated on
a map torn from an atlas where he dumped three of his eight victims
in Utah.
   Numerous searches over several months in central Utah netted
hundreds of animal bones but only a single human kneecap. It was
among 10 bags of bones collected by searchers in early May near a
road leading into Fairview Canyon, 150 miles south of Salt Lake
City.
   That was where Bundy, a former Utah law student, had said to
look.
   Within days, Belva Kent, her ex-husband, Dean, and two of their
three surviving children went with detectives to the rock-strewn
hillside.
   ``We were very peaceful down there,'' Belva Kent said in an
interview Friday night. ``I came home feeling better than I have in
15 years.''
   It took longer for Dean Kent. But after some weeks he concluded
that Bundy, in this instance, hadn't been lying.
   ``Based on what we had known from his confession, his
description fit the area. I'm confident it's a good possibility
that's where he disposed of the remains,'' Dean Kent said.
   ``It's given me peace of mind to believe that's what happened.''
   The state medical examiner said the kneecap was likely that of a
young woman, but there was no way to determine if it was Debra
Kent's.
   Debra Kent disappeared the night of Nov. 8, 1974, from a high
school parking lot in Bountiful, 10 miles north of Salt Lake City.
She had left a play early to pick up her younger brother, Bill, at
a roller rink.
   Even though the Kents had been certain for years that Debra was
a Bundy victim, his confession and execution struck them in
surprising ways.
   ``I had anticipated a much different feeling than I had,'' Dean
Kent said. ``I'd felt some of the bitterness would be relieved, but
that isn't the case. I think I'll carry that to my grave.''
   Belva Kent, 53, relived the grief all over again.
   ``Everyone says you're not given more than you can handle, but
I've been questioning that a bit lately,'' she said.
   After Debra disappeared, her brother, Bill, blamed himself. His
bitterness toward Bundy was matched only by his inability to stifle
the pain. Five years ago, after his marriage broke up, he died at
26, in an alcohol-related auto accident.
   Within months of Bill's death, Dean Kent started drinking,
walked out on a 29-year marriage, quit his job as an oil company
executive and fathered a child. He lives alone now, trying to come
to grips with his shattered life.
   ``I certainly feel he was the cancer that destroyed our
family,'' Kent said of Bundy.
   Belva Kent had raised five children and never worked outside the
home. Her self-esteem departed with her husband.
   ``But then there comes a point where you see the bitterness
doesn't get you anywhere,'' she said, so she got a job and has been
working since.
   Last summer, Belva Kent was diagnosed as having a benign brain
tumor behind her forehead the size of a tangerine. Surgery had to
be put off when doctors found she also was suffering from multiple
sclerosis.
   Then, in a reaction to an anti-seizure medication, Belva Kent's
entire body blistered and peeled, leaving her right eye tearless.
   Belva Kent's been back to work for three weeks now, slowly
regaining strength for the brain surgery she will have in late
spring.
   ``I guess it's not my nature to feel sorry for myself,'' she
says. ``Besides, other people suffer, too. It's just that my
hardships are more obvious.''
   After Debra disappeared, the Kents kept the front porch light
burning day and night. It's kept on now, Belva says, as a memorial.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice was swift in a kangaroo court
on the streets of Panama City on Saturday. Time elapsed from arrest
to trial to release: 30 minutes.
   The streets of the beleaguered capital had calmed somewhat by
Saturday, four days after the U.S. invasion unleashed a frenzy of
looting.
   There was little left to take by the weekend, and the level of
gunfire had dimmed to sporadic exchanges in most of the city.
   The balance appeared to have tilted in many areas in favor of
the armed citizen patrols barricading their neighborhoods with
everything from exercise bikes and toilet bowls to overturned
trucks and concrete blocks.
   ``Where are the gringos? Where are the MPs? Where are the
police?'' demanded a man helping guard a supermarket, where steel
bars staved off looters.
   ``We know this invasion was necessary,'' he said. ``But Panama
has been looted because they are not around. They have not made any
effort to protect decent citizens.''
   He and his neighbors, armed with everything from pistols to
double-barreled shotguns, had been guarding Punta Paitilla, a
middle-class area, for days. Nerves were on edge.
   They were letting shoppers enter the market in groups of five.
Hundreds of people stood in the hot sun waiting their turn at the
dwindling stock.
   Suddenly, a group of vigilantes came down the street herding
four prisoners _ suspected looters stopped at a barricade nearby.
   The men were put face down on the pavement and searched. Their
hands were tied behind their backs with shoelaces and belts as a
crowd gathered.
   The mood was ugly.
   ``Shut your mouth!'' a gray-haired man shouted as one of the
prisoners tried to speak.
   ``Look at the fat one!'' another man cried. ``He's trembling!''
   One of vigilantes began kicking the man in the head.
   ``Stop it!'' people shouted, rushing to pull the vigilante back.
Another self-appointed cop fired his pistol into the air. Things
calmed down.
   ``I know this man,'' one bystander said, coming forward. ``He's
no thief.''
   The captors moved their prisoners to a curb, sat them down and
began to question them as others came forward to vouch for the man
or question the vigilantes about the ``arrest.''
   A spontaneous ``court'' was in session.
   The man who had been kicked showed his identity cards.
   He was Felix Suarez, a 52-year-old minibus operator with a
contract to transport employees of Fort Clayton, one of the U.S.
bases near the city. He also held a permit for the .32-caliber
pistol he had been packing.
   ``This is a mistake,'' Suarez said. ``It's a bad mistake.''
   The vigilantes admitted the gun was what sparked their
suspicions. Suarez and his companions, all more poorly dressed than
most in the crowd, had not been caught in the act of looting.
   ``We're going to let them go,'' someone declared, and people in
the crowd nodded their approval. ``There is no proof they did
anything wrong.''
   As Suarez and his companions were untied, a doctor who asked
that his name not be used watched his neighbors thoughtfully.
   ``We are trying to impose some order here,'' he said. ``So far,
people have not done savage things. But we don't have anywhere to
send them (prisoners). We don't have any police. Someday we'll have
to say: let's eliminate them.''

   A York holiday tradition will be enjoyed across
the country this Christmas, with National Public Radio broadcasting
a local rendition of Christmas carols.
   But don't turn the volume up too high.
   The instrument being played is the steam whistle at the New York
Wire Co.
   ``You can hear it 10 miles outside of York, depending on the
wind irection,'' said Don Ryan, of York.
   At one time the whistle marked the beginning and end of the work
day at the 101-year-old company, which makes screens for the window
and door industry and industrial screens.
   For the past 56 years, the whistle has been blowing Christmas
carols every holiday season, and for 34 of those years it's been a
Ryan family project.
   Ryan, 43, an assistant project director at Motter Printing of
East York, picked it up from his 73-year-old father, Marlin Ryan.
Ryan's son, Scott Ryan, 23, and his daughter, Lisa Ryan, 22, also
help.
   NPR, whose programs are carried by about 400 radio stations
across the country, will broadcast part of a performance recorded
Friday on Christmas morning along with an interview with Marlin
Ryan.
   The NPR team recorded the whistle performance _ ``Silent
Night,'' ``The First Noel,'' ``Oh, Come All Ye Faithful'' and ``Joy
to the World'' _ from a block away, not because of the volume but
to avoid the sound of machinery in the plant.
   In the midst of a rehearsal, 5-year-old Joshua Flickinger of
York, whose mother is an aquaintance of the Ryan family, walked
over to Scott, reached up and tapped him on the elbow.
   ``Are you going to blow it?'' Joshua asked.
   Scott nodded affirmatively.
   ``Don't blow it,'' Joshua shouted. ``It hurts my ears.''

   You, too, can join the search for Noriega _ from
the comfort of your desk chair or couch.
   A new computer game called ``Find Noriega'' has hit the market
just days after the U.S. military began looking for Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama.
   Developed by Eugene, Ore.-based Abracadata, the game sends the
player on a chase that features Noriega look-alikes, an
interrogation of Tammy Faye Bakker, and the interception of top
secret-coded messages from the CIA to President Bush.
   It also includes fighting off fans at Graceland with a Noriega
look-alike disguised as Elvis.
   When news of the Panama invasion broke early Wednesday, Nancy
West, project manager for the company's Adventure of Learning
division, held a brainstorming session with her staff.
   Using a previously written program, they wrote a different,
topical scenario that was ready for shipment by Friday.
   ``A player can change the game as the news changes,'' West said.
   The game runs on any Apple II series or fully compatible
computer and retails for $89.95.

   A young, unemployed man was charged with
setting a fire that killed three people at a senior citizens
apartment complex, police said.
   George Ludlow Jr., 26, of Watertown was arrested late Friday,
and charged with three counts of second-degree murder, police said.
He was being held without bail.
   Jefferson County District Attorney Gary Miles said Ludlow
confessed to the crime during interviews with members of the joint
task force investigating the fire. Miles said Ludlow also signed a
confession.
   In addition to the three people who died, 71 were injured,
including three firefighters, in the Dec. 15 fire, which began in
the community room of the 16-story Mid-Town Towers apartment
building.
   The fire ripped through the first floor, and smoke filled the
complex's upper floors, forcing the evacuation of 151 residents in
the 60s, 70s and 80s.
   Miles refused to discuss the motive for the fire or allow police
to comment on it. ``I have a very strict policy: I don't discuss
evidence,'' Miles said.
   Police Chief Michael Hennegan said his department had no contact
with Ludlow before the arson investigation.
   ``He is unemployed and lives with his parents. He is a
functional illiterate,'' Hennegan said.
   The 23-member task force has put in more than 2,000 hours of
police work since the fire, the chief said.
   ``We had a number of leads simultaneously leading to this man,''
he said.

<HEAD>Bernstein Conducts Concerts in Honor of East European Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beethoven's Ninth Symphony became an ode to
freedom on Saturday as Leonard Bernstein united musicians from East
and West at the start of a Christmas musical gala to honor Eastern
Europe's struggle for freedom.
   Hundreds of people dressed in their finest poured into the
gleaming Schauspielhaus in East Berlin on Saturday afternoon for a
rehearsal before two official concerts of Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony.
   Bernstein was invited to perform by Justus Frantz, performance
director of West Germany's Bavarian Radio, to celebrate the
historic events in East Germany that led to the opening of the
country's borders Nov. 9.
   ``I just couldn't say no,'' Bernstein said as he stepped
backstage after the nearly two-hour rehearsal. Young people mobbed
the legendary conductor for autographs outside the concert hall
before he returned to West Berlin.
   Bernstein conducted the Ninth Symphony at the first concert
Saturday night in the West Berlin Philharmonic. He will conduct a
second performance in East Berlin on Christmas morning.
   Frantz said Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was chosen because of the
symbolism of the final movement of the piece, which is based on
Friedrich Schiller's Ode to Joy with its plea for world brotherhood.
   ``Europe is opening up. All men are becoming brothers and so we
chose the Ninth Symphony and musicians from all nations as a salute
to freedom,'' Frantz told The Associated Press.
   East Germany officially drops visa requirements for West German
travelers on Sunday, and the performance in West Berlin was timed
to end as the clock struck midnight.
   The international orchestra includes musicians from West and
East Germany, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, France and the
United States, the four victorious World War II allies still
technically responsible for governing Berlin.
   The 71-year-old American conductor is the latest in a series of
world-renowned musicians to travel to Berlin since the wall began
to crumble on Nov. 9.
   Sir Yehudi Menuhin conducted a benefit concert in West Berlin
this month to help rebuild decaying East German city centers and
Mstislav Rostropovich and Daniel Barenboim also played in West
Berlin shortly after the concrete barrier was opened.

   Journalists itching to get to the
hemisphere's story of the year have sometimes chafed at the
restrictions imposed on them by the U.S. military.
   ``If we had it to do over again, we would never have allowed you
all to come,'' said a harried Air Force Col. Ronald Sconyers,
spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command.
   Reporting has indeed been dangerous _ though not impossible _ in
the days following the U.S. invasion that began Wednesday.
   Snipers, Panamanian Defense Force resisters, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's Dignity Battalion fighters, looters, and various and
sundry assailants roamed the city with U.S. soldiers searching for
Noriega himself.
   Several reporters, including Candice Hughes of The Associated
Press, were held hostage and threatened with death by Noriega
loyalists before they were set free.
   The U.S. Embassy said Saturday that pro-Noriega forces had
released Jon Meyersohn, a CBS producer seized Wednesday at the
Marriott Hotel, and American businessman Doug Mullen. CBS said
Mullen was an executive with GTE and was taken hostage with
Meyersohn.
   Some journalists were not so lucky. A Spanish photographer was
killed and two foreign journalists were wounded by gunfire.
   Before dawn Friday, about 300 journalists arrived here. But the
Southern Command kept most of them cooped up at Howard Air Base and
on nearby Rodman Naval Station.
   Clad in a helmet and full battle gear, Sconyers briefed a
hungry, tired, unwashed legion of reporters late Friday at Howard,
four miles west of Panama City.
   ``A reporter's job is currently impossible on the streets of
Panama City,'' he said.
   The journalists slept on the floor and lived on hot dogs and
popcorn while waiting for permission to leave. Though mindful of
the danger in Panama City, most of the journalists began to chafe
at the restrictions.
   By Saturday morning, Southern Command authorities had convinced
about a third of the journalists to return home. The command then
``released'' the other reporters.
   ``I can understand why they did it. I don't like it, but I
understand it,'' said one U.S. reporter.
   A handful of journalists was able to get into Panama on small
chartered planes Thursday before two big charters _ one from Miami
and the other from neighboring Costa Rica _ arrived early Friday.
   It was that descent of hundreds of reporters that set off alarms
at the Southern Command.
   One reporter who arrived Thursday, Marjorie Miller of the Los
Angeles Times, said it was dangerous to report from the streets
Friday and that setting loose several hundred reporters _ most with
little or no experience in Panama or in combat _ could have had
grave consequences.
   ``There were a lot of people with guns on the streets,'' said
Ms. Miller, who has worked in Central America for several years
covering war and social upheaval.
   One reporter called the restrictions an attempt to
``breast-feed'' the media with what the Southern Command wanted
reporters to hear and to keep them away from the ugly side of the
invasion.
   He said individual reporters and their organizations should be
allowed to consider the risks and take responsibility for their
coverage.

   The U.S. armed forces offered rewards
Saturday of up to $5,000 in ``cash, not checks'' to Panamanians who
turn in bullets, grenades, pistols and automatic weapons.
   In a radio broadcast, the U.S. military said the weapons had to
be ``personally'' turned in.
   But it warned: ``It is important the weapon be wrapped in a
white sheet and be held high so we know you don't present a
threat.''
   In addition to $1 million being offered for information leading
to the arrest of ousted strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
rewards listed were: $25 for ammunition or hand grenades, $50 for
rocket grenades, $100 for pistols, $150 for automatic weapons, and
$5,000 for a weapons cache.
   ``You will be paid in cash, not checks or money orders,'' the
broadcast said. ``Let us eliminate arms from the streets so there
can be peace and democracy in Panama.''

<HEAD>State Department: U.S. Supports New Romanian Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States is seeking ways to supply
further emergency medical assistance to the new, pro-democracy
government in Romania, the State Department said Saturday.
   ``The United States supports the newly constituted Romanian
government and its commitment to democratic reforms,'' a statement
issued by the department said.
   In Bucharest on Saturday, provisional government leaders said
they captured deposed President Nicolae Ceausescu and they pledged
to put Eastern Europe's last Stalinist dictator on trial for
persecuting the nation.
   The National Salvation Committee, the name of Romania's
provisional revolutionary governing coalition, has announced a
program of democratic reform. The State Department said the United
States views the provisional government as ``the manifestation of
the democratic will of the Romanian people.''
   It called on remaining Ceausescu supporters, including members
of the secret police, to ``lay down their arms and put an end to
the tragic bloodshed in Romania.''
   Humanitarian aid already has been offered by the United States
and efforts are being made to supply further medical assistance,
the State Department said.
   U.S. officials are consulting with allies and others, including
the Soviet Union, on the evolving situation, the statement said.
   ``The United States calls on the international community to
offer its moral and political support to the cause of democracy in
Romania,'' the State Department said.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church called on
the United States Saturday to end its military action promptly,
saying the attack had ``trampled'' on Panama's sovereignty and
caused death, destruction and hunger.
   ``Even though the action was aimed at bringing freedom to all
Panamanians, we cannot help but lament the deep wound inflicted to
our free and sovereign country and the enormous human and material
damages it has caused, especially among the poor,'' said a
communique from the nation's Roman Catholic bishops that was read
by Archbishop Marcos McGrath.
   The church asked that food and medicine be sent to the embattled
nation following a four-day looting spree that created shortages
after Wednesday's assault on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces.
   The Panamanian people are ``living through an invasion and days
of ncertainty because of the U.S. military action that was
undertaken with the declared intention of toppling a dictatorial
regime and installing democracy,'' the statement said.
   Although the church has strongly opposed Noriega, the statement
did not mention the general by name. He was toppled by U.S. troops
and a new government installed, but remains at large.
   The church also asked the United States to ``end their military
action as soon as possible'' and that the newly installed civilian
government restore order and create a new police force to stop
rampant looting.
   ``It hurts us that Panamanian and foreign blood has been spilled
on our soil,'' it said. ``It hurts us because our nationality, our
Panamanian sovereignty has been trampled.''

<HEAD>U.S., Britain and France Veto Resolution Denouncing Invasion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States, Britain and France
vetoed a proposed Security Council resolution Saturday to denounce
the U.S. invasion of Panama and demand the immediate withdrawal of
U.S. troops.
   ``We acted in Panama for legitimate reasons of self-defense and
to protect the integrity of the Canal treaties,'' U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering said.
   ``I am not here today to claim a right on behalf of the United
States to enforce the will of history by intervening in favor of
democracy where we are not wanted,'' he said.
   ``We are supporters of democracy, but not the gendarme of
democracy, not in this hemisphere or anywhere else.''
   Britain has expressed complete support in the 15-member council
for the U.S. invasion to oust Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega. France has condemned both the invasion and
Noriega's dictatorship.
   Canada, a non-permanent council member, also voted with the
Western allies.
   The two Communist permanent members, the Soviet Union and China,
voted in favor of the denunciation, along with Algeria, Brazil,
Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.
Finland abstained on the issue.
   Virtually all other nations in the world body have rejected
Washington's argument that it acted in self-defense to protect the
35,000-member U.S. community in Panama, saying no nation has the
right to invade another.
   The 159-nation General Assembly will reconvene Thursday to hear
speeches condemning the U.S. invasion and to adopt a resolution
demanding an immediate troop withdrawal, diplomats said.
   However, General Assembly resolutions are only advisory, unlike
Security Council resolutions, which can be enforced by political or
military action.
   The Security Council resolution, introduced by the Non-Aligned
Movement, would have demanded ``the immediate cessation of the
intervention and withdrawal of the U.S. armed forces from Panama.''
   It would have strongly deplored ``the intervention in Panama by
the armed forces of the United States, which constitutes a flagrant
violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of states.''
   In October 1983, the United States vetoed a virtually identical
resolution denouncing its invasion of the island of Grenada.
   The Security Council has not decided which of two competing
would-be Panamanian ambassadors represents the legitimate
government _ Noriega's nominee or one appointed by U.S.-installed
President Guillermo Endara.
   Endara is widely believed to have been the winner in
presidential elections May 7, but the balloting was rejected and
nullified by Noriega.

   Here are some facts and figures on Romania:
   
   THE LAND _ Romania covers 91,699 square miles, about the size of
Oregon. It is in southeastern Europe, bordered by Hungary,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, the Black Sea and the Soviet Union. Principal
rivers are the Danube and its tributary, the Prut; the country is
cut by the Carpathian Mountains.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Romania's population is estimated at 23 million.
Bucharest, the capital, is by far the largest city with a
population of about 1.9 million. Most of the people are Romanian,
but about 10 percent are of Hungarian or German extraction. The
dominant religion is the Romanian Orthodox Church.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Romania is a large exporter of petroleum and
natural gas, and has iron, coal and copper mines as well. Chief
agricultural products include corn, wheat, wine grapes, sugar beets
and potatoes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The country obtained full independence from the Turks
in 1878 and was proclaimed a kingdom in 1881.
   Romania was one of the victorious allies in World War I, but
after the war it was wracked by political violence. In 1940, Ion
Antonescu overthrew King Carol II and established a dictatorship
that was aligned with Germany in World War II. As the German Axis
foundered, King Michael was able to re-establish a monarchy in
1944, but occupying Soviet troops led to the proclamation of a
Communist republic in 1947.
   Nicolae Ceausescu, 71, took power in 1965 after the death of his
mentor, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. His 24 years of hard-line rule
ended with his ouster Friday.

   A crowd of about 1,500 on streets and
rooftops cheered, whistled and ate snowcones Saturday as members of
Gen. Manuel Noriega's defense force surrendered to U.S. soldiers at
a former Noriega compound.
   Alone or in small groups, the men materialized out of the crowd
and laid down their weapons. The mass of people surged forward
against a ropeline signaling their approval for the surrender.
   When the weapons were given up, a cheer rang out as if a
touchdown had been made in a football game.
   Even the new prisoners had to smile at the crowd's antics.
   Lt. Col. Jeff Rock of the 7th Infantry Light Division from Fort
Ord, Calif., said the surrenders began shortly after dawn and
continued nonstop into the afternoon.
   He spoke to the first reporters to visit the town, which is at
the western most edge of the U.S. controlled sector.
   About 200 Noriega loyalists surrendered just outside of town at
about 8 a.m. and a steady stream of former Panama Defense Force
soldiers arrived at the military post throughout the day. By late
afternoon more than 400 men had surrendered, U.S. officials said.
   ``They come in twos, fours, sixes,'' said Specialist Pierre
Remy, also of Fort Ord, who was manning a guardpost. ``We had three
buses that came in.''
   Marines first entered the town Wednesday during the initial U.S.
invasion. Attack planes and armored vehicles partially destroyed
the Panamanian army compound, said Marine Chief Warrant Officer
Charles Rowe.
   The U.S. Army returned to the town Saturday morning to restore
order after several days of looting.
   Reporters touring the village saw little sign of looting on
Saturday, although one group of men was observed using a welding
torch to cut through the security gates of a store.
   Buildings along the main avenue of the town were spray painted
with anti-American graffiti, but residents said the signs predated
the U.S. invasion when, they maintained, people were forced to
feign support for Noriega.
   Rock said there was no resistance to the U.S. force when it came
back into the town Saturday and that many people cheered. When a
reporter asking onlookers how much support remains for Noreiga, the
crowd responded in unison, ``Nada, nada'' - meaning none.
   Silfredo Diaz Pinzon blamed the looting on the Noriega bands
known as the dignity battalion. A smiling woman wearing a ``Don't
worry, be happy'' t-shirt shouted in Spanish, ``Indignity''
whenever someone referred to the dignity battalion.
   She and others said the U.S. troops were the first Americans
they had ever seen in their town. Despite the celebrating, one
woman said, ``I won't relax until Noriega is captured.''
   Nariciso Miranda, a leader in the Christian Democratic Party,
said he never thought ``this great day would ever come.'' When
Noriega came to power he thought it was ``the end of Panama,'' he
said.
   Except for the minor looting and the crowd scene outside the
military compound, life appeared near normal at La Chorrera.
Taxicabs were running, U.S. soldiers were keeping order at two open
grocery stores, and a gas station was operating.
   But Rock said the U.S. soldiers might have to stay for a while.
   ``There is absolutely no city government left here whatsoever,''
said Rock, adding that talks are underway with local officials to
try to establish post-Noriega town government and police force.

   A couple, their son and their daughter were
found slain in their home Saturday morning after it was set on
fire, police said.
   State troopers discovered the bodies after neighbors heard a
smoke alarm in the house and called police at 7:07 a.m.,
authorities said. Firefighters put the blaze out before much damage
was done.
   State police Capt. Robert Farrand identified the dead as Warren
Anthony Harris, 39; his wife, Delores, 41; 11-year-old son Mark;
and 15-year-old daughter Shelby.
   Farrand, who is in charge of the investigation, said the fire in
this village of 1,500 people about 50 miles south of Syracuse was
being investigated as arson.
   He said police would not release more information on the
slayings, saying the investigation was extremely sensitive.
   Police said they had no suspects. Investigators interviewed
Dryden residents in an attempt to recreate the last 24 hours of the
Harrises' life.
   Police set up a command post at a church near the house, and
authorities asked anyone with information to call police.
   The Onondaga County Medical Examiner's office was expected to
perform autopsies on the Harrises on Sunday.
   The Onondaga and Tompkins counties district attorneys' offices
were also taking part in the investigation.

   A top deputy to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega telephoned U.S. marines who were occupying his ranch and
asked for it back, soldiers said Saturday.
   Rigoberto Paredes, Noriega's political chief in the area west of
Panama City and the reputed head of the local Noriega secret
police, was told he could reclaim the ranch and a nearby mansion if
he surrendered.
   He did not, and when the marines left the property on another
mission, angry local residents sacked it.
   They ``looted the house and set it afire,'' said Cpl. Jeff
Newsome of Norfolk, Va.
   Newsome said he took part in the initial attack when U.S. forces
fired upon and destroyed a local headquarters for Noriega's police.
   The burned-out, two-story station was empty but adorned Saturday
with a large makeshift banner declaring ``Endara Presidente.''
Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president of Panama when the U.S.
operation commenced on Wednesday. The United States considers him
the winner of the May election in Panama which Noriega declared
void.
   Arraijan, along the Pan American Highway, was still largely
isolated Saturday as the U.S. military continued its operations.
   The local citizens drank beer and watched as the soldiers took
into custody Noriega loyalists who were surrendering. Shops, some
of them which had been looted, were closed and citizens said they
had no food or water.
   ``We have wanted change for 20 years,'' said Bernalldo
Altamirri. ``We want everything finished. We want to pass a good
Christmas and a good New Year's.''
   ``If they do not catch Noriega, it is not finished,'' he said of
the U.S. operation.
   Felipe Barrera said, ``President Bush said he is sending food. I
don't see it.''

   A strong earthquake off Guam shook the western
Pacific, the Hong Kong Observatory said Sunday. There were no
immediate reports of damage or injury.
   The observatory said the quake, which occurred Saturday,
registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   The quake's epicenter was 322 miles northeast of Guam, the
observatory said. Guam is one of the Marianas Islands about 1,500
miles east of the Philippines.
   There were no further details on the quake.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded
on seismographs. Each increase of one number means a tenfold
increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated

   Two Americans held hostage in Panama
were released Saturday, and they said their captors included
current or former Panamanian soldiers who indicated they might kill
them.
   But the hostages, CBS producer Jon Meyersohn and Doug Mullen, an
American businessman, said they had not been mistreated during
their captivity.
   The two were taken captive Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel in
Panama City as the U.S. assault on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
forces reached its height.
   Meyersohn told a news conference in Panama City that he and
Mullen were taken to several locations during their captivity,
first to a jungle clearing, then to a farmhouse, then to an
apartment in the city.
   He said their hands had been tied, they were at one point bound
to trees, and they feared for their lives.
   They gave ``no inclination they weren't going to kill us,''
Meyersohn said.
   He said they were held in the jungle by five captors _ three men
and two women _ armed with knives, pistols, grenades, and automatic
weapons. The captors were either current or former members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, he said.
   Meyersohn said Mullen persuaded the captors to let them make a
telephone call Friday, allowing them to contact their families and
employers. They were released Saturday at a neutral location.
   A statement by the U.S. Embassy said the embassy ``worked
diligently to secure their release.''
   Meyersohn said the captors were very disorganized and undecided
about what to do with their hostages.
   ``Once they realized they couldn't bargain for us, they held us
for their security,'' Meyersohn said. ``They just didn't know what
to do.''
   Mullen called the captivity ``a roller-coaster ride.''
   ``I was very conscious of the fact that in Panama at this time,
there were a lot of desperate people, and desperate people do
desperate things.''

   Revolutionary leaders said they had
captured deposed President Nicolae Ceausescu on Saturday and would
put the Soviet bloc's last Stalinist dictator on trial. Heavy
fighting broke out in the capital.
   The insurgents claimed control of the country after a night of
ferocious battles between army units siding with pro-reform
protesters and security forces loyal to Ceausescu, who fled his
palace Friday.
   But loyalist guards continued to battle army units in Bucharest
Saturday. Bursts of gunfire echoed among the grandiose canyons of
buildings and monuments the Communist leader built to himself
during 24 years of rule.
   Rocket-propelled grenades slammed into the 13-story television
building in an attempt to silence the opposition's broadcasts.
   At about 1 a.m. Sunday local time (7 p.m. EDT), most of the
shooting in Bucharest had stopped and the city was virtually
silent, Hungarian Defense Ministry spokesman Gyoergy Keleti said on
Hungarian television.
   Fighting raged Saturday at Bucharest's international airport
Otopeni, with pro-Ceausescu forces in helicopter gunships strafing
army units, the state news agency Agerpres said.
   The pilot of an Austrian plane that brought aid into Bucharest
Friday evening said when he returned to Vienna late Saturday that
he had seen at least 30 bodies of dead attackers at the airport.
   The pilot, who was not identified in an interview with Austrian
television, said battles raged for hours at the airport, with
grenades and mortars being used.
   Fighting also was reported in outlying cities, including
Timisoara, where the revolution broke out on Dec. 15. However, an
Associated Press reporter in the city said revolutionary soldiers
were in control.
   An Austrian television reporter said there was an ``unbelievable
attack'' Saturday afternoon by pro-Ceausescu forces who had
parachuted into Timisoara the day before. He quoted eyewitnesses as
seeing bodies on the street.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in two days of street
fighting and thousands more were reported killed in a week of
crackdowns on the burgeoning protest movement.
   Revolutionaries took swift revenge against pro-Ceausescu
fighters captured near the downtown post office, killing them on
the spot.
   Romanian television gave a jubilant boost to the revolt,
announcing that the army had captured Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena, one day after the dictator was ousted by a week-old popular
revolt.
   The ``dictatorial family, Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, was
captured,'' declared Ion Iliescu, a member of the provisional
revolutionary governing coalition.
   Ceausescu did not appear on televison, however. Broadcasters
said he would not be shown to prevent rescue attempts by loyalists.
   The television had first reported Friday that Ceausescu and his
wife were captured, but withdrew that report.
   Iliescu called Ceausescu a ``poison hyena'' and said the new
government would prosecute the former president and his wife, who
had been the second most powerful person in the country.
   Emil Bobu, who in the past was put in control of the country
when the Ceausescus were traveling abroad, also was captured with
the Ceausescus, Iliescu said.
   On Friday, the revolutionaries announced they had captured
Ceausescu's eldest son, Niku, a powerful member of the ruling
familial cabal.
   In Bucharest, fighting continued around the television and radio
stations and the partly damaged Communist Party headquarters, where
security forces barricaded themselves late Friday. Revolutionary
force appealed to residents nearby to evacuate.
   Gorbachev asked other Warsaw Pact nations to cooperate in
devising ``coordinated efforts in providing support to the people
of Romania,'' the Tass news agency reported.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said said a Warsaw Pact
meeting planned Sunday was scrapped because ``the situation shows
signs of stabilization.''
   Soviet officials all but ruled out direct unilateral Soviet
military help, but Gorbachev said medical aid was being extended.
   ``The first planes with medicines and urgent supplies have
already arrived in Bucharest,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
``But they still are being held up in the Bucharest airport, which
is blockaded.''
   Doctors at Bucharest Emergency Hospital said they had treated
hundreds of wounded at that hospital, one of 14 in the city.
   Dr. Marian Palaschivescu, haggard in a filthy blue terry cloth
hospital jacket, told reporters 51 bodies had arrived by early
afternoon at Bucharest Emergency Hospital. He then glanced at three
sets of legs protruding from the trunk of a car that screeched to a
stop. ``No, 54,'' he said.
   The army, which rose against Ceausescu on Friday, was joined by
amateur revolutionaries suddenly at war after decades of
repression. Their ragtag forces were nervous and often
trigger-happy in the face of desperate professionals fighting for
their lives against inevitable criminal prosecution under a
reformist government.
   The National Salvation Committee, the name of the coalition
provisional government, announced that Gen. Nicolae Militaru, an
army officer demoted under Ceausescu, had been appointed defense
minister.
   Maj. Gen. Stefan Gusa, former first deputy defense minister and
Gen. Victor Stanculescu were appointed his deputies, Romanian
television said.
   ``We are in control almost all over the country,'' Gusa
announced over Romanian radio. ``There still are isolated bands of
desperates who try to destroy what we have conquered. They have
failed and they will fail.''
   ``Let us restore the quiet in these historic but also difficult
moments,'' he urged. ``Everything must go back to normal as soon as
possible.''
   The National Salvation Committee warned against last-ditch acts
by the cornered presidential guards and the hated special police.
Guards screened all people entering the Intercontinental Hotel.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the National Salvation
Committee also had advised embassies in Bucharest to barricade
themselves.
   Chinese embassy windows had bullet holes in them, and the Soviet
news agency Tass said it had been told a building housing Soviet
trade representatives was in the firing line.
   The diehard forces supporting Ceausescu adopted guerrilla
warfare tactics in the city, holing up in hotels, apartment
buildings and on roofs and firing at soldiers and civilians on the
streets.
   Despite the tension, many Romanians were clearly enjoying their
sudden freedom. People took wild rides around town waving huge red,
gold and blue flags from which they had ripped the center symbol of
Ceausescu's brand of communism.
   Romanians on the street expressed happiness in tempered terms,
but choked voices and misted eyes underscored the feeling.
   As gunfire smacked the television building, the youth program
editor, Marin Constantin, clowned for a dozen people pinned down
with him.
   ``This has finally woken us up from our sleep of death,'' he
said.
   The state of the war shows partly why it was necessary,
Romanians pointed out. About the only thing in apparent abundance
in this shortage-plagued nation was ammunition.
   Taxis were commandeered to carry wounded, and few private cars
had enough fuel. Many shops were closed, but they are usually
bereft of goods when open.
   Early Saturday, Petre Roman, one of about 20 members of the
National Salvation Committee, said the committee wanted free
elections by April and would assure ``a certain amount of political
and economic stability'' in the meantime.
   In Timisoara, the birthplace of the revolt that swept Ceausescu
from power after 24 years of increasingly autocratic rule, two
people were reported killed and six wounded in fighting Saturday.
   Fierce fighting also was reported at various times from the
cities of Brasov, Arad and Sibiu.
   Relatives continued a grisly search in forests outside Timisoara
through mass graves of corpses, most naked and many mutilated, of
victims of a massacre by security forces last weekend.
   The protests began when hundreds of people gathered Dec. 15 to
rally against the threatened arrest of an ethnic Hungarian pastor.
They evolved into huge demonstrations that drew hundreds of
thousands nationwide.
   Ceausescu ordered troops to fire on protesters, fueling more
demonstrations.
   Romanian television said the death toll approached 12,000, but
there was no confirmation.
   The revolt reached Bucharest on Thursday. Ceausescu and his wife
fled the city in a helicopter Friday.

   The U.S.-installed president
struggled Saturday to form a government and create a security force
to restore order as pockets of fighters loyal to the fugitive Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega held out against the invasion.
   Two Americans who were taken captive at the outbreak of the
invasion were freed. About 2,000 new U.S. troops began reinforcing
the thousands of troops who have met unexpectedly stiff resistance
by forces loyal to the ousted dictator.
   Troops continued the hunt for the elusive Noriega.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said Noriega's Dignity Battalions are ``increasing their
activities of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar fire,
threatening the civilian population, and hostage-taking.''
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of Southern Command, said U.S.
forces are not yet ``over and done with the Dignity Battalions.''
He said earlier that an estimated 1,800 members of the battalions
were active, broken up into small groups.
   The Pentagon reported that 25 U.S. servicemen, four more than
listed Friday, had been killed in the fighting. Officials also said
two American dependents had been killed, 241 U.S. troops had been
wounded, and one was still missing.
   The military said 139 Panamanian soldiers had been killed and 95
wounded. There was no official count of casualties among Panamanian
civilians.
   There were reports of higher casualties. Dr. Elmer Miranda,
deputy director of Santo Tomas Hospital, said his morgue held 200
bodies. He said a colleague said there were 60 more in Gorgas
Hospital, run by the U.S. Southern Command.
   ``Noriega destroyed everything when he fell. Everything went
back to zero,'' said President Guillermo Endara, who was sworn in
Wednesday morning shortly after the U.S. attack began.
   Endara said in an interview that the news of the U.S. invasion
was ``like a kick in the head. It was not the best thing I would
have thought.''
   ``We were not really consulted,'' said Endara, who said he was
``very diplomatically'' told of President Bush's plans only two or
three hours before the invasion was launched. He said plans for
keeping public order should have been worked out better in advance.
   ``I would have been happier without an intervention,'' he said.
But he said he could work with the Americans: ``The gringos have
their defects, but I am used to ... them.''
   The 24,000-member U.S. force has been unable to put down
remaining loyalists, some of whom attacked Southern Command
headquarters Friday. The loyalists periodically surprised the
Americans with mortars and sniper fire. Noriega remained at large,
with rumors flying as to his whereabouts. forces at the
presidential palace had turned themselves in and the building had
been secured.
   Thurman, speaking at a briefing, also said a total of 2,250
people had been detained, 15,500 weapons seized, and 33 armored
vehicles captured.
   Pro-Noriega forces released Jon Meyersohn, a CBS News producer
seized Wednesday at the Marriott Hotel, and Doug Mullen, an
executive with GTE who was taken along with Meyersohn. There had
been no earlier reports of Mullen's captivity.
   Meyersohn told a news conference in Panama City that he and
Mullen were taken to several locations during their captivity,
first to a jungle clearing, then to a farmhouse, then to an
apartment in the city.
   He said their hands had been tied, they were at one point bound
to trees, and they feared for their lives. However, he said they
were not mistreated.
   The hostages were held in the jungle by five captors _ three men
and two women _ armed with knives, pistols, grenades, and automatic
weapons, Meyersohn said. He identified the men as current or former
members of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   He said Mullen, who speaks Spanish, finally managed to persuade
the captors to let them make a telephone call Friday, allowing them
to contact their families and employers. They were released
Saturday at a neutral location, he said.
   Four days of fighting have left parts of Panama City in ruins,
with buildings demolished by U.S. bombings and streets littered
with debris from rampant looting. The capital of 1 million is
suffering from a growing shortage of food and medicine.
   ``We are trying to open the airport and trying to open the
Bridge of the Americas so we can bring in medicine and food,''
Endara said in the interview.
   Airports around the country and the bridge were closed for the
fourth day. The bridge is the main crossing of the Panama Canal,
which splits the country in two.
   Thousands of Panamanians sought refuge in schools and churches
to escape the fighting and many formed neighborhood vigilante
groups and set up barricades to protect themselves from looters.
About 28,000 people were left homeless by the destruction of the El
Chorrillo neighborhood near Noriega's headquarters.

   Firefighters insist the man they pulled out
of a chimney Saturday wasn't really auditioning for Santa Claus'
job, he was just trying to get home in time for Christmas.
   The 20-year-old man's family was locked out of their house in
the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. They decided the best way
to get inside was for him to go down the chimney, said city Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells.
   The victim, who was not identified, was about halfway down when
he got stuck, Wells said.
   Firefighters used a sledgehammer and a battering ram to poke a
hole in the chimney, then pulled him out, the spokesman said. The
man escaped with minor scratches.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Denounces Separatist Sentiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev lashed out Saturday
at secessionist sentiments threatening to pull his country apart,
charging that they were leading to ``conflict and blood and death.''
   Gorbachev, jabbing his hands in the air, spoke to the Congress
of People's Deputies. A Communist Party Central Committee was
expected Sunday to discuss the Lithuanian party decision to break
with the national party.
   ``To realize the right to self-determination through secession
means to blow up the union, set people against each other and sow
conflict and blood and death,'' Gorbachev told the Congress.
``That's what separatists are pushing us toward.''
   The Congress broke into applause.
   Gorbachev has tried hard over the last several months to prevent
the Lithuanians from abandoning the national Communist Party. He
reacted with anger when it made its decision Wednesday.
   The Lithuanian party move is part of a long-range program to
restore the independence that the small Baltic republic enjoyed
between the world wars.
   Later Saturday, the Congress balked at a declaration denouncing
the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact that led to the absorption of Lithuania
and two other Baltic lands, Latvia and Estonia, into the Soviet
Union.
   The declaration received 1,052 votes _ 70 short of the majority
required for approval. A total of 678 deputies voted ``no.''
   Supporters said they would try to win approval once more on
Sunday, the final day of the Congress.
   With its vote, the Congress ``demonstrated its conservatism,''
said Estonian deputy Marju Lauristen. ``Fifty years later, they
prefer to sleep with Stalin's dreams.''
   The resolution was supported by Baltic deputies who claim their
homelands were victims of dictator Josef Stalin's aggression. It
would condemn as invalid the secret protocol of the Soviet-Nazi
non-aggression pact on the eve of World War II.
   In Lithuania, activists reported that the republic's Communist
Party had split in two, one party professing loyalty to its mother
party in Moscow and another, larger party that has declared its
independence from Moscow.
   The activist Lithuanian people's front, known as Sajudis,
reported that party members who had opposed breaking off from
Moscow had formed their own leadership in a ``factual split'' from
the independent party.

   The world prayed and offered support Saturday for
the embattled Romanian people who ousted Nicolae Ceausescu and were
fighting to preserve their newly won freedom.
   As army units backing the popular uprising fought elite police
squads supporting Ceausescu, the widespread euphoria over the
downfall of the hard-line Communist dictator turned to anxiety over
the continuing bloodshed.
   In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told lawmakers
that his country was standing by with unspecified aid for the
anti-Ceausescu forces.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov all but ruled out military
intervention, saying, ``We have to support them from the point of
view of medical help and maybe some other kinds of help, but to
bring in forces, I think that's impermissible.'' In Eastern and
Western Europe, appeals were launched for money, food and medical
supplies. The French government announced it was sending two planes
carrying 30 tons of medical equipment and a medical team to Romania.
   China, apparently taken by surprise by the loss of one of its
strongest allies, has made little comment. A Foreign Ministry
statement Saturday said the political struggle in Romania was an
internal affair of that country and it hoped the turmoil would not
affect good relations with China.
   Britain said it was sending emergency medical supplies,
including equipment for treating gundshot wounds and providing
blood transfusions.
   Sweden's government said it had allocated $3.1 million in
medical and food assistance.
   However, East bloc news reports and the International Committee
of the Red Cross in Geneva reported Saturday that emergency
supplies were being blockaded.
   Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Budimir Loncar instructed the
Yugoslav Embassy in Bucharest to contact the National Salvation
Committee to express his country's support for the ``courageous
struggle of the Romanian people for democracy,'' the Tanjug news
agency reported.
   In Czechoslovakia, the Social Democrats opposition group said in
a statement that it ``resolutely condemns brutal repressions of the
Stalinist regime in Romania, welcomes the fall of bloody dictator
Ceausescu and wishes the Romanian people many successes on the path
toward a democratic society.''
   The Romanian Embassy in China, a longtime supporter of
Ceausescu, announced Sunday it fully backs the provisional
government that has ousted him from power.
   Also throwing allegiance behind the new government were the
Romanian diplomatic missions in Iran, the Netherlands, Libya,
Switzerland, Jordan, Sweden, Turkey, Greece, Poland, Sudan, Spain,
Italy, France, East Berlin and Bangladesh.
   In Washington, Michael Hornblow of the State Department's Task
Force on Romania said Romanian Ambassador Ion Stoichici informed
the department in writing that he and the embassy staff were
aligned with the new government.
   In Israel, Vice Premier Shimon Peres said, ``Ceausescu was, as
you know, on world matters a man for peace; on internal matters a
man who used very strong measures like nobody since Stalin.''
   From a Jewish point of view, he said, a judgment is not simple
because ``he is the only one who recognized Israel from among the
Communist countries and continued diplomatic relations.''
   The Foreign Office in London announced that it had evacuated
nine Britons including the wives and children of some diplomats
from Romania.
   Many East German political, church and citizens groups expressed
solidarity with the Romanian people and many called for aid to be
sent to Romania.
   Some set up special bank accounts to collect donations, and one
church group appealed to all East Germans with access to foreign
currency to give one West German mark for victims of Ceausescu's
terror.
   Poland's pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza published a four-page
special edition Saturday exclusively on the Romanian situation and
distributed it free, with a request that 100 zlotys be donated
instead to the Polish Red Cross for aid to Romania.
   The Polish Red Cross broadcast a radio request for humanitarian
aid for Romania in the form of money, clothing and medical
supplies, especially bandages. It also appealed to blood donors,
saying the Polish blood banks would be open late Saturday and on
Christmas Eve.
   The British Red Cross launched a Help Romania appeal and the
relief organization Oxfam made an immediate initial grant of
$160,000 for medical supplies.
   Christian Aid said it made a grant of $32,000 through the World
Council of Churches to churches in Romania and Hungary.
   Ion Ratiu, president of the World Union of Free Romanians, said
he hoped to return to Bucharest soon and start a mass circulation
newspaper.
   Regarded as a possible future leader, Ratiu told Britain's
domestic news agency Press Association from his home in Switzerland
that ``if they give me leadership I would be delighted to do it,
but I don't want to impose myself on anyone.
   ``My heart is bleeding for the thousands and thousands of people
who have been killed. It is a terribly high price to pay.''

   About 450 mourners braved snow and freezing
temperatures Saturday to attend the funeral of Alderman Robert
Robinson, the civil rights attorney killed by a mail bomb and
eulogized as someone who loved politics and people.
   ``He would never let you down,'' Savannah NAACP President Curtis
Cooper told mourners at St. Paul's CME Church. ``He was the type of
man who could walk with kings, but never lost the common touch.''
   Robinson, 42, died Monday night shortly after a bomb mailed to
his Savannah law office exploded as he opened it. He was the second
victim of mail bombs federal officals believe might have been sent
by racists with grudge against the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   Robinson's death came two days after a similar bomb killed 11th
Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance and seriously injured his wife at
their home in a Birmingham, Ala., suburb.
   Despite the cold and more than 2 inches of snow in the Savannah
area, mourners packed the church for Saturday's service.
   The Rev. Henry Delaney, pastor of St. Paul's, said Saturday that
Robinson's death might seem senseless, but is part of a higher
political agenda for black Americans.
   Delaney said the death should be used to propel black politics
in Georgia forward, without fear of racist retaliation. He pointed
out that New York City elected its first black mayor shortly after
a black teen-ager was shot to death in a predominantly white
neighborhood.
   ``Don't you give up, Mrs. Robinson. Don't you give up, mother
Robinson. Don't you give up, children,'' Delaney shouted,
addressing Robinson's widow, mother and two children.
   ``Robbie was killed because he was a lawyer and because he
sought to rectify wrongs,'' said Alderman Floyd Adams, his voice
often cracking with emotion. ``If he were here, he would say `Don't
look at this as a setback. Don't be discouraged.'''
   W.W. Law, a former president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said Robinson's life should serve as
a role model for young people, to inspire them to help those
shackled by social or economic injustice.
   ``There is so much instruction to be learned from this life,''
he said. ``He was the model of self-improvement and worked toward
the improvement of his community.''
   State Rep. Jim Pannell said Robinson's loss should strengthen
people in their resolve to help each other.
   ``The bombs of hatred will not drive us back,'' he said.
   Hours before Robinson died, a parcel bomb was found at the 11th
Circuit building in Atlanta. The next day, another one was
discovered at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   On Friday, a county circuit judge in Hagerstown, Md., was
injured when a bomb exploded in his apartment 20 minutes after a
package was delivered. FBI officials said preliminary reports
indicated the incident was unrelated to the other bombings.
   FBI investigators have concentrated on possible racial
motivations in the slayings.
   Robinson represented the NAACP in a desegregation case involving
Savannah schools.
   Agents determined that Vance wrote an opinion in an unrelated
Jacksonville school desegregation case in September that was a
victory for the NAACP. A three-judge panel of the appeals court
unanimously reversed a lower court's ruling that Jacksonville could
stop busing students because the school system was integrated.

   A flood of holiday gifts and get-well wishes
overwhelmed scores of wounded soldiers recuperating Saturday from
injuries they suffered in the fighting in Panama.
   ``Who are these people from California?'' Army Cpl. Joel Reyes
asked from his hospital bed as he looked through a gift basket and
read a Christmas card signed by a family.
   A Brooke Army Medical Center official said get-well wishes had
poured in from across the country for the wounded soldiers.
   ``This has been a tremendous outpouring of caring and concern,''
San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell told soldiers at Brooke. ``We hope
you'll come back when everything is more peaceful and enjoy our
city ... We hope for each of you a very speedy convalescence.''
   Reyes and more than 100 other soldiers being treated at Brooke
and at Wilford Hall Medical Center were loaded with gifts from
department stores, restaurants and businesses.
   A platter of shrimp from a seafood restaurant sat on a stretcher
in the hallway of one ward at Brooke. The San Antonio Chamber of
Commerce delivered fruit baskets and shopping bags full of gifts _
including chunks of the Berlin Wall.
   Reyes said he injured his arm when it became caught in static
lines while he parachuted from an aircraft. The 19-year-old from
Warden, Wash., is a member of the 2nd Ranger Batallion, 75th Ranger
Regiment.
   Army Spec. 4 August Schomburg of Chicago, who was shot in the
arm, described the difficulty of fighting in Panama.
   ``It was scary _ you never really knew who you were up
against,'' said the 23-year-old father of three. ``Every now and
then someone would wave and blow a kiss. Then someone would shoot
at you.''
   At Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, a cargo plane arrived with
the bodies of three soldiers killed in the fighting.
   Two of the dead were identified as Chief Warrant Officer 2
Wilson B. Owens, 29, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Spec. Alejandro I.
Manriquelozano, 30, of Lauderhill, Fla. The third was not
immediately identified.
   The remains of 21 servicemen have been returned to the base
since U.S. troops invaded Panama early Wednesday.
   The Pentagon said 25 American soldiers have died, 241 have been
wounded and one was missing. Two U.S. civilians also have died.
   Dozens of wounded servicemen have been transferred from San
Antonio back to their home bases, including 37 soldiers who
returned to the Army's Fort Bragg, N.C., Friday night.
   ``We're glad you're back, and we're glad you're doing as well as
you are,'' Col. Mark Blaedel, acting commander of Womack Army
Community Hospital at Fort Bragg, said at a news conference
Saturday.
   Most of the soldiers suffered minor wounds, and Blaedel said 22
of them were released from the hospital by Saturday afternoon.
   Sgt. Berry Kelly, a 23-year-old squad leader in the 82nd
Airborne Division, said he was injured when another paratrooper
went over him, collapsing his parachute and causing him to freefall
the last 150 feet to the pavement below. He suffered torn ligaments
in his right ankle.
   The paratrooper from Goodwater, Ala., said he thought he did
well to fall as far as he did ``and only mess up my ankle a
little.''
   Spec. Ronald Stacey, 21, of Kings Mountain, N.C., said he spent
``a good day'' in Panama before he was hit in the arm by shrapnel.
   Both Kelly and Stacey, who wore the Purple Hearts they received
in San Antonio, told reporters their training had prepared them for
combat duty.
   ``I knew what to expect,'' Stacey said. ``It's scary. Quite
scary. You know it's real when somebody shoots back at you.''
   Elsewhere at Fort Bragg, the families of some of the base's more
than 3,000 soldiers in Panama looked to each other to overcome the
hardship of separation.
   ``It's important for the wives and families to stay together,''
said Pam Hall, whose husband, Lt. Col. Wayne Hall, was in Panama.
   ``Some of the ladies who have never been through this are
understandably unnerved. But morale is good. We miss our husbands,
but we are proud of them and respect what they are doing.''

   Frigid arctic air continued to grip the central and eastern
states Saturday, setting all-time records along the Gulf Coast and
allowing snow to fall from Myrtle Beach, S.C., to northern Florida.
   The morning low of 11 degrees at New Orleans was the lowest
temperature ever recorded there, as was a low of 2 degrees below
zero at San Angelo, Texas.
   Record lows for the month of December were set in 30 cities from
Texas to Alabama, and record lows for the date were smashed in
dozens more.
   The arctic air mass was so cold and dense that barometric
pressure records were set from Texas to Mississippi, including an
all-time record high reading of 31.02 inches at Brownsville, Texas.
   Record cold also held sway from the central Plains to the
central Appalachains.
   In all, 116 cities reported new record lows for the date
Saturday morning, with 40 of those also being new records for the
month of December. A total of 253 daily record lows have been
established east of the Rockies in the past two days.
   The freezing spell may go down as the coldest on record in
Kansas. Topeka set an all-time low with a reading of 25 degrees
below zero Saturday morning, one day after Concordia and Goodland
set new all-time records with lows of 26 below and 27 below,
respectively.
   Just across the Missouri line in Kansas City it was 23 below,
tying the all-time low set just the day before.
   Overnight temperatures plunged below zero from the Plains to New
England, with readings of 20 below in South Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.
   The low in the Lower 48 states early Saturday was 31 degrees
below zero at Yankton, S.D.
   Morning lows above the freezing mark were confined to the
Florida peninsula, with lows in the 60s in extreme southern Florida
   Snow fell in northern Florida overnight and along the Georgia
and Carolina coast. By sunrise, 5 inches covered the ground at
Myrtle Beach and at Wilmington, N.C.
   Heavy snow continued to fall in North Carolina, with up to 7
inches on the ground at Cape Hatteras and winds producing drifts up
to 2 feet deep.
   Advisories for dangerous wind chill readings were in effect for
North Carolina and extreme southern sections of Virginia, Delaware
and Maryland.
   A freeze warning was posted for southwestern Florida, and a hard
freeze warning was issued for south central Florida. Advisories for
dangerous wind chill readings as cold as 10 degrees below zero were
posted for all of the Sunshine state.
   Westerly winds broke the cold spell in parts of the Plains and
north-central states. The temperature at North Platte, Neb.,
climbed 60 degrees in a few hours from an early morning low of 26
degrees below zero to an afternoon reading above the freezing mark.
   The temperature at La Crosse, Wis., climbed above zero Saturday
afternoon for the first time in nearly four days.
   Dense fog developed in the Pacific Coast region overnight but
otherwise fair weather prevailed west of the Rockies.

<HEAD>Report: Possible Link Between Crack and Pneumonia Symptoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors say heavy crack-smoking is making
addicts critically ill with symptoms similar to pneumonia,
according to a published report.
   The condition, which has been dubbed crack-lung, is not readily
detected unless patients tell doctors of their crack addiction, The
New York Times reported in Sunday editions. If not treated
properly, it can lead to death.
   The condition has been identified in four inner-city hospitals
in Detroit and the problem also has been recognized in New York and
Baltimore, the newspaper said.
   While giving outward signs of suffering from pneumonia, the
patients do not respond to antibiotics or other anti-pneumonia
treatments.
   Scientists remain unsure what causes the condition, but some
believe it is caused by a variation of any number of ailments that
occur when poisonous compounds are introduced into the lungs, the
Times said. The condition also may be caused by other drugs used in
combination with crack or used to produce the cocaine-derivative.
   Dr. Dana G. Kissner, a Detroit pulmonary specialist, said
crack-lung patients suffer severe chest pains and breathing
problems, and often have high temperatures and cough up blood.
   Kissner, who with four other colleagues reported the condition
in the journal Radiology, said the young people he saw with the
condition were smoking between 15 and 25 pipes of crack a day.
   One thing that makes the condition unique is the absence of an
infectious organism _ a virus or bacterium _ and the
ineffectiveness of antibiotics in fighting it, Kissner said.
   But the condition can be successfully treated with
corticosteriods, which are anti-inflammatory drugs, Kissner said.
   Dr. James T. Kennedy, an associate professor at the New York
University School of Medicine, said he has seen about 24 young
people with the condition in the last two years.

   The United Mine Workers and Pittston Co.
failed Saturday in a last-ditch effort to reach a pre-Christmas
settlement in a bitter, nearly 9-month-old strike by 1,700 coal
miners in three states.
   Negotiations recessed Saturday evening with an agreement that
both sides would return to the bargaining table Wednesday.
   Government-appointed mediator W.J. Usery, who had said he wanted
to end the strike by Christmas, told both sides he expected to
settle the dispute by next Friday, according to sources familiar
with the talks. Because of a gag order imposed by Usery, the
sources would talk only on the condition of anonymity.
   A settlement by the end of next week would allow the Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky miners to return to work after the
traditional holiday shutdown of mining operations.
   Striking mine workers in Castlewood, Va., said they were not
surprised that contract talks were called off.
   ``I wasn't expecting too much,'' said Bob Dixon, a UMW local
president from St. Paul, Va. ``We did not want to get our hopes up,
that way they don't get shot down.''
   Miners pulling the late shift at the picket shack in McClure,
Va., agreed with Dixon. ``It's kind of what I expected,'' said a
miner who did not want to be identified. ``It was not realistic to
expect so much so soon.''
   Usery, hoping to meet his goal, had the two sides at the table
virtually around the clock all week, taking a break at midnight
Friday but calling negotiators back to the table Saturday morning.
   Considerable progress was made in the past few days but Usery
decided to recess the bargaining until next week because it was
clear that an agreement could not be reached, drafted and approved
in time for the bargainers to make it home for Christmas.
   The possibility of a settlement kept Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, who appointed Usery, in Washington _ delaying a trip she
planned to North Carolina for Christmas.
   The nearly 1,700 miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary on
April 5, walking off the job at mines in Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky after working 14 months without a contract.
   Wages never have been a major sticking point. Instead, the
walkout was prompted by Pittston's refusal to participate in an
industry agreement on how to fund costly miners retirement and
health plans.
   The talks are being closely followed throughout the coal
industry because of the implications a settlement might have on
future discussions about the benefit plans.
   The strike has been costly for both sides.
   The union has paid the strikers about $200 a week in benefits
and is facing fines totallying $63.5 million for violating court
orders limiting picketing and other strike activities. Last week
the union said it would give striker a $1,250 Christmas bonus.
   Although Pittston hired replacement workers, production has been
well below pre-strike levels. The company reported that its coal
operations lost $3.6 million in the second quarter of 1989 and $9.8
million in the third quarter, compared to profits of $9 million and
$7.4 million in the respective quarters of 1988.
   The company has said special security requirements to protect
replacement workers and equipment has cost more than $10 million.
   At times, the strike has turned violent.
   Thousands of striking miners were arrested as a result of
demonstrations in the early months of the strike. Several strikers
also have been arrested in connection with violence against
replacement workers at some of the mines.

<HEAD>Giorgio Cavallon, Pioneer in Abstract Expressionism, Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artist Giorgio Cavallon, considered a pioneer of
abstract expressionism, has died at age 85.
   Cavallon, who died Friday night at New York Hospital, had a
following among poets and painters even though his work was not
widely known.
   ``I had conditioned myself to think of him as a lesser artist.
But he kept showing us to be wrong in that,'' said William Agee, a
historian of American art.
   Abstract expressionism is characterized by an emphasis on the
artist's spontaneous and self-expressive application of paint in
creating a non-representational composition. Cavallon's paintings
often featured color rectangles with soft, irregular edges.
   The artist was born in the village of Sorio in Italy in 1904.
During World War I, he lived on an uncle's farm, where he drew in
the earth or scratched drawings on bombshells.
   In 1920, he came to the United States, settling with his family
in Springfield, Mass. Six years later, he moved to New York.
   He began as a figurative painter at the National Academy of
Design. He began exploring abstract expressionism in the 1930s but
like other abstract expressionists did not take the full plunge
until the late 1940s.
   In 1936, he was a founding member of the American Abstract
Artists, a contentious and polemical group that championed the
cause of abstract art.
   Cavallon preferred to do everything by hand, including building
his own freezer, stove and sofa. He even made his own paints.
   His work was exhibited in several New York galleries and last
year was shown at the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation in Venice, Italy.
His work is in several major museums' collections, including New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art.
   Cavallon's first marriage to singer Fabiola Caron ended in
divorce. He later married painter Linda Lindeberg. She died in 1973.
   He is survived by two sisters.

from a 14-story condominium, burned two construction sites and set
the roofs of five expensive homes ablaze before it was doused early
Saturday.
   Seven firefighters suffered minor injuries and an 89-year-old
woman was hospitalized for smoke inhalation. All were in good
condition, said Fire Chief Donald Manning.
   A fire also broke out Saturday morning on the top floor of a
15-story apartment building in San Diego. Six people were
hospitalized with minor injuries and dozens were evacuated.
   The Los Angeles fire broke out around 3:30 a.m. in a four-story
apartment building that was in the final stages of construction,
and spread to the condominium tower and to a three-story apartment
building. It hopped Wilshire Boulevard and ignited chemical drums
at a construction site and residential roofs downwind.
   The cause was unknown but arson teams were investigating,
Manning said.
   Four hundred firefighters battled the blaze in the neighborhood
between the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club and the University
of California, Los Angeles.
   Firefighters had to battle thick smoke and extreme heat to
evacuate the apartment building's residents.
   ``The smoke and the heat are so bad that firefighters are going
in to look for people on their hands and knees,'' said Sgt. Gene
Allen of the UCLA Police Department. Everyone was accounted for by
late morning, said Fire Department spokesman Ed Reed.
   Many of those evacuated were people in wheelchairs, Allen said.
   A damage estimate was not immediately available, but losses were
expected to be in the millions.
   Some residents said a sound resembling an explosion preceded the
outbreak of the fire.
   In San Diego, fire broke out around 8:30 a.m. in a 15th-floor
apartment and flames and heavy smoke spread to the 13th and 14th
floors, said a city fire dispatcher who declined to give her name.
   Firefighters contained the three-alarm blaze within an hour, the
fire dispatcher said. It was not known exactly how many people were
evacuated. Damage to the building was estimated at $300,000.

<HEAD>Tutu in Holy Land; Supports Palestinian State</HEAD>

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa told a
group of Moslem clerics and Palestinian activists Saturday that he
supports the Palestinian struggle for an independent state.
   He made the comment during a five-day Christmas pilgrimage to
the Holy Land that has angered some Israelis. The nation's two
chief rabbis have refused to meet with Tutu, and some Israelis say
the visit could provoke Christmas rioting among Palestinians.
   Near the Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, Tutu
bowed his head in a moment of silent prayer at a stone platform in
memory of more than 600 Palestinians killed by Christian militiamen
in 1982 at refugee camps near Beirut, Lebanon.
   ``We support the struggle of the Palestinian people in their
longing for statehood and independence,'' Tutu told assembled
Moslem clerics and Palestinian activists.
   Among about 30 Palestinian dignitaries was Feisal Husseini, a
leading activist in the occupied territories who supports the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We pray that the day will come soon when a Palestinian state
will exist side-by-side with a Jewish state and Arab and Jew will
hold hands together,'' Tutu said.
   ``We come as those who know suffering from the inside, and we
hope that our presence in this country will bring hope and
encouragement to the people who are the victims of injustice and
oppression.'' he said. ``We are struggling for our own
self-determination in South Africa.''
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to
end racial discrimination in his homeland, spent the morning in
meetings with Palestinian religious leaders. He then visited
Judaism's holiest site, the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where one
Orthodox Jew shouted ``Don't desecrate the wall!'' as Tutu
approached.
   Tutu met with Rabbi Yehuda Getz, the rabbi in charge of the
Western Wall, and prayed at the site while ultra-orthodox Jews sang
and danced in the background in celebration of the second night of
the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.
   Earlier Saturday, Tutu, leader of South Africa's Anglican
Church, met with the patriarchs of the Latin, Greek Orthodox and
Armenian churches.
   The civil rights crusader arrived Friday for his visit. He was
scheduled to visit Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on
Christmas Eve and preach in Jerusalem on Christmas Day.

   Leaking butane gas exploded Saturday at an
Amoco Oil Co. refinery, killing one worker and injuring another, a
company spokesman said.
   Amoco and Casper firefighters took three hours to put out the
blaze, which began with a flash of fire around 6:30 a.m.
   Rick Nemitz, 33, was killed when the gas ignited as he was
shutting down an outdoor refinery unit, and was either blown to the
ground or fell from an upper deck, according to spokesman D. Allen
Miller.
   Kurt Sides, 31, who had been working on the ground, suffered
second- and third-degree burns to his face and left hand, Miller
said. Sides was in stable condition at Wyoming Medical Center.
   ``We don't have any idea what ignited the butane,'' Miller said.
``At this point we don't even know the extent of the damage.''
   No one else was in the area at the time of the blast, Miller
said. The unit, which combines butane and other gases to produce
high-octane gasoline, will be shut down until investigators can
determine the cause of the blaze.
   The leak occurred at the connection point of two pipes, Miller
said.
   Miller said there must have been a very high concentration of
butane before the blast because such gas leaks usually dissipate
into the air. He said he didn't know what ignited the gas.
   Amoco officials and the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration were investigating the accident, the spokesman said.
   Amoco Oil is a subsidiary of Amoco Corp.

   The FBI and state and local police
arrested six men Saturday who had broken into a bank and are
potential suspects in bank burglaries in the United States and
Canada, an FBI spokesman said.
   The men had already outsmarted the bank's alarm system when they
were arrested about 4 a.m. while trying to break into the vault of
the Coolidge Bank and Trust Co., said spokesman Paul Cavanaugh.
   The arrests culminated a 14- to 16-month joint investigation and
surveillance involving the FBI and Montreal police, Cavanaugh said.
   The men had broken in by drilling a hole through a concrete
floor from offices above the bank. They were carrying a cache of
burglary tools, electronic scanners and walkie-talkies, FBI
officials said.
   Arrested were James Joseph McCormack, 50, and John Joseph
Murray, 35, both of Charlestown; Benjamin Wonsch, 49, of Plymouth;
and Paul T. Bryntwick, 38, Ronald McCann, 57, and Talbot Murphy,
61, all of Montreal.
   The men were being held in area jails, and were scheduled to be
arraigned Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston.
   The six are possible suspects in a half-dozen unsolved bank
burglaries in the United States and Canada, Cavanaugh said.
Saturday's heist was similar to a successful 1988 holiday weekend
burglary of a Boston bank that reportedly netted $125,000.

   A top-level Syrian envoy said Saturday the
presidents of Egypt and Syria will soon meet to put an end to a
12-year rift.
   The emissary, Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam, strongly
indicated after talks with President Hosni Mubarak that the two
countries will resume diplomatic relations.
   Khaddam, the highest ranking Syrian official to visit Egypt
since 1977, arrived Saturday with what he called ``a message of
amity and brotherhood'' from President Hafez Assad to the Egyptian
leader.
   ``The coming meeting between the two presidents will lead to
practical and concrete results in rectifying the status of
Egyptian-Syrian relations,'' Khaddam told reporters after
conferring privately with Mubarak for about 1{ hours.
   Asked specifically whether the summit would bring restored
diplomatic ties, Khaddam said: ``When we speak about rectifying the
status of relations, we mean a comprehensive approach, not a narrow
one.''
   Egypt and Syria together fought Israel in the 1973 Middle East
war, but Syria broke ties four years later in response to
then-President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in
November 1977, which led to a peace treaty.
   Syria was only one of 17 Arab states that broke ties with Egypt
over its peace initiative with Israel. All but Syria and Libya have
since renewed ties.
   Khaddam said the summit ``will be in the very near future.'' He
said Assad and Mubarak would decide where and when to meet.
   Egyptian-Libyan relations improved considerably this year
without full diplomatic reconciliation. Mubarak and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi have met three times since October and have agreed
on broad economic cooperation between their countries.

<HEAD>Settlement Reported in Ethnic Intimidation Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A county Republican Party, two GOP
assemblymen and their campaign workers have agreed to pay $400,000
to settle a lawsuit accusing them of hiring uniformed guards to
intimidate Hispanic voters, a lawyer said.
   Under the proposed settlement, none of the defendants would
admit any wrongdoing, said Darryl Wold, attorney for the Orange
County Republican Party.
   But he said Friday their four insurance companies each would pay
$100,000 to the plaintiffs, five Hispanic voters and the Orange
County Democratic Party.
   A federal judge must approve the settlement. The lawsuit had
been scheduled for trial Jan. 16 in U.S. District Court.
   State and federal agencies are still investigating the posting
of guards at 20 polling places in predominantly Hispanic voter
areas of Santa Ana on Nov. 8, 1988, when Assemblyman Curt Pringle
of Garden Grove defeated Democrat Christian ``Rick'' Thierbach by
843 votes for an Assembly seat.
   The guards carried signs in English and Spanish warning that
non-citizens cannot legally vote.
   Hispanic community leaders complained it was racially motivated
intimidation. County GOP officials responded that the guards were
there only to monitor and report election fraud.
   Pringle and another defendant, Assemblyman John R. Lewis of
Orange, could not be reached for comment Saturday. Calls placed to
their offices rang unanswered, and directory assistance had no home
numbers listed for them.
   Michael G. Balmages, chairman of the county Democratic Party,
praised the settlement but said he was sorry the case would not be
going to trial.
   ``The plaintiffs will not get their day in court and the public
will be deprived of learning more about the illegal,
unconstitutional and highly unethical acts that were committed by
the Orange County Republican Party and the campaign of Mr.
Pringle,'' he said.
   ``A million dollars would not compensate for this infringement
on our civil rights,'' said Reuben Martinez, treasurer of the
county Democratic Party.
   Joseph Remcho, the plaintiffs' chief attorney, expects the
settlement will be approved. He said a court order prevented him
from discussing it further before all parties sign it.

   Romanian exiles rejoiced Saturday at the downfall of President
Nicolae Ceausescu and the prospect of democracy in their homeland,
but sadness over the uprising's heavy human toll tempered their
celebrations.
   ``I am happy for the Romanian people, but I'm crying for the
thousands of people who have died,'' said Lucien Gozariu, who
joined about 200 people at a rally in downtown Detroit.
   Ceausescu ran his country virtually as a family fiefdom for 24
years, but a popular revolt lasting only a week toppled the Soviet
bloc's last Stalinist dictator on Friday.
   Reform-minded insurgents claimed to control Romania on Saturday
after two days of fighting in which hundreds are believed to have
died. Thousands more were reported killed during crackdowns earlier
in the uprising.
   An Indiana professor who was making his way out of Romania on
Friday after teaching English there said the entire city of
Bucharest seemed to be in the streets after the Ceausescu regime
fell.
   ``I have never seen so much joy, such smiles on their faces,''
Sam Longmire of Evansville said Friday night in a telephone
interview from Frankfurt, West Germany.
   ``One young woman discovered I was American and hugged me and
kissed me and wouldn't let me go until her friends pulled her off
and back into the parade,'' he said.
   At the Detroit rally, Romanians cheered when told of reports
that Ceausescu had been captured by the Romanian army.
   ``They should put him in a cage and march him around the country
and let the people do to him what they want,'' said Ioan Borod.
   Some people carried pictures of Ceausescu with a circle drawn
around his head with the words ``Spit Here'' written in magic
marker.
   Rev. Roman Braga, spiritual advisor to the Romanian Orthodox
convent near Jackson, Mich., cautioned against vengeance.
   ``It will take some time to rebuild,'' Braga said. ``The people
must forgive and forget because with hatred you can't accomplish
anything.''
   Many at the rally weren't in a forgiving mood. At one point
several people threatened a priest, claiming he was an agent of
Romania's secret police.
   ``He is an agent of Ceausescu. Even in the United States they
spy on us,'' said Gozariu, who left Romania in 1977. The priest
fled before violence could erupt.
   A Romanian-American in Chicago remembered the victims in their
homeland and the dictator whose reign of repression had ended.
   ``My heart is with the people who died,'' said Viorel Catarama,
33, who runs a construction company in suburban Hinsdale. ``They
paid the price but it's worth it in a way.
   ``I hope for the best. I hope for democracy. I hope for freedom
of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to express yourself, and
most of all, now I'd like to see the president being brought to
justice,'' Catarama said.
   In New York, exiles who had protested nightly during the past
week outside the Romanian mission to the United Nations celebrated
there Friday night, sipping champagne, waving Romanian flags
stripped of the socialist symbol and chanting ``Victory, Victory.''
   Some had spoken to friends and relatives in Romania earlier
Friday.
   ``My mother was crying _ all she could say was `I'm free,'''
Horia Dugala, 26, said after speaking with his mother in Brasov.
   The members of the New York-based coalition of groups called
Romania 21 held another demonstration outside the mission Saturday
and appealed to the international community to send medicine,
blood, weapons, and United Nations troops to their country.
   ``Our people need weapons,'' said the Rev. Aurel Radulescu, head
of Romania 21. ``We don't want foreign troops in Romania, only U.N.
troops to stop the killing. We cannot do it alone, we need the help
of the American people and of the United Nations to stop the crimes
and killings.''
   About 400 people, including people of Romanian, Hungarian and
Chinese descent, rallied outside San Francisco's City Hall Friday
night and chanted ``Free Romania! Free China! Thank you, America1!''
   Some exiles in south Florida's Romanian community credited
Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci for helping trigger the uprising by
defecting last month.
   ``I think that Nadia's escape woke up a lot of people,'' said
Emil Pintilie of Hollywood. ``She was the first step that made
people start protesting so that Ceausescu would go away.''
   Comaneci was in New York and could not be located for comment.
   Emile Popa, who defected in 1987 while working for the Romanian
government in this country, said Ceausescu's fall was the best
Christmas present his family could receive.
   His wife, Cornelia, 35, and their children Maria, 7, and Roxana,
3, waited more than two years for permission to leave Romania and
were reunited with Popa during Thanksgiving week.
   ``I don't care if we don't get anything else. I'm just happy,''
said Popa, who lives near Cary, N.C., and works as an international
sales representative.

   Two thousand fresh American troops were
airlifted to Panama on Saturday as U.S. commanders conceded alarm
over the unexpectedly stiff resistance by forces still loyal to
fugitive Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The reinforcements, including a helicopter company, were sent
from the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.,
and joined 24,000 other U.S. soldiers, many of them bone-weary, on
Day Four of the nation's largest combat operation since the Vietnam
War.
   It is an operation that has turned quickly from the conventional
warfare of the initial strike, which virtually neutralized the
Panamanian Defense Forces, to the more perplexing mission of
countering guerrilla attacks and policing a nation in institutional
chaos.
   The Pentagon reported that 25 U.S. servicemen, four more than
listed Friday, had been killed in the fighting. Officials also said
two American dependents had been killed, 241 U.S. troops had been
wounded and one was still missing.
   The military said 139 members of the PDF had been killed, and 95
wounded. There was no official count of casualties among Panamanian
civilians.
   U.S. forces said they had recovered 15,500 weapons, including 33
armored vehicles, with an increasing number of arms laid down
voluntarily by surrendering members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces, including the garrison which guarded the presidential
palace. The number of PDF detainees totaled 2,250, according to
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command.
   Despite the massive recovery of weapons, commanders said
Noriega's ``dignity battalions'' continued to draw fresh arms and
ammunition for hit-ad-run attacks upon troops and civilians.
   One American officer said the loyalists of the self-styled
``maximum leader'' _ whose whereabouts remained undetermined _ had
used ambulances to shuttle their weaponry around Panama City.
   Still, Thurman, briefing reporters in Panama, offered several
bits of ``good news'' late in the day. He said:
   _Nine employees of Evergreen International Airlines, an American
cargo carrier, had been released by pro-Noriega forces and
evacuated by U.S. troops to the safety of Howard AFB. According to
Thurman, the airline employees had been stripped to their underwear
and beaten, but were not seriously hurt.
   _The effort to create a new Panamanian police force under the
new, U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara was proceeding
at an encouraging pace. ``Today we brought down 750 uniforms and
1,000 people showed up,'' he said.
   ``The people are cooperating with us and are beginning to lay
down their weapons,'' the general said. In areas torn both by
looting and combat, he said, ``people are ... cleaning up the
debris.''
   CBS News, meanwhile, reported that CBS producer Jonathan
Meyersohn, who had been held by pro-Noriega forces since the early
hours of the U.S. assault, had been released.
   Thurman, while stressing progress in the effort to pacify the
PDF, conceded ``that does not mean we're over and done with with
the dignity battalions,'' the guerrilla-styled irregulars still
loyal to Noriega.
   The Southern Command also reported that prisoners at an island
penitentiary in the Pacific, about 60 miles from the capital,
apparently had overcome their pro-Noriega guards and had radioed
for help from American forces. The prison group was said to include
some of the former Panamanian officers who led a failed coup
attempt on Oct. 3.
   Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the Southern Command,
said Saturday that the dignity battalions were ``increasing their
activities _ of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar fire,
threatening the civilian population, and hostage-taking.''
   Pressed for specifics, Marguila replied ``I don't have in my
mind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday of
dignity-battalion efforts. It's just that they are becoming more of
a concern, because they are taking more of our time as opposed to
the PDF.''
   At the Pentagon, one military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, conceded the ferocity of the dignity battalions had
caught U.S. commanders off guard.
   A Pentagon spokesman also said the F-117 stealth fighter-bomber
was among the new weapons used for the first time during combat in
the Panama attack. Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist said the plane, which
is designed to evade enemy radar, was used successfully on one
mission, bombing a field near a PDF barracks to create ``confusion
and alarm'' among the enemy.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was at his office on Saturday to
keep tabs on developments in Panama as well as the bloody
revolution which ousted Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
President Bush was at Camp David, Md., where he worked on a
Christmas Eve address to the American military men and women around
the globe, including a ``special message'' for those in Panama.
   Bush planned to tape the Armed Services Network broadcast at the
Pentagon on Sunday, where he also was to receive an extended
briefing on the Panama fighting.
   Bush was briefed by telephone Saturday by national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft on both Panama and Romania.
   The president plans to go to a Houston hospital on Dec. 31 to
visit soldiers wounded in Panama.

   Cold and snow burst into Florida on Saturday, threatening fruit
and vegetable crops, as Arctic air forced temperatures to more
record lows that had utilities and fuel companies scrambling to
keep up with demand.
   Three utilities in Texas had to institute ``rolling blackouts''
because they couldn't keep up with demand for power, with Houston
most seriously affected with 150,000 without service Saturday
afternoon. Other utilities asked customers to conserve power and
shut off service to some commercial clients, and heating oil and
propane were high priced and in short supply in some areas. Power
was also in short supply in Virginia and Florida.
   The National Weather Service reported 112 record or record-tying
lows, including 31 below zero at Yankton, S.D., the official
coldest spot in the Lower 48 states.
   The frigid weather has been blamed for the deaths of at least 73
people in 26 states since Dec. 15. The toll included 89-year-old
Arthur Howze, who was found dead of hypothermia Saturday lying on
the floor of his home in front of a small space heater, Lauderdale
County Coroner Marl Cobler said.
   Saturday's low of 26 degrees below zero at Topeka, Kan., was the
coldest there for any date since record-keeping began in 1887; the
previous record was 25 below in February 1899. Kansas City, Mo.,
had an all-time low of 23 below zero. The low of 2 below zero at
San Angelo, Texas, also was an all-time record. Thirteen Texas
cities posted record lows.
   Low-temperature records for the date also were set or tied in
Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia
and the District of Columbia.
   But temperatures in many areas were not quite so low as Friday,
and a change was edging in from the West.
   Jordan, Mont., had a low Saturday of 31, compared with 45 below
zero just two days earlier, thanks to Chinook winds blowing down
the eastern slopes of the Rockies. At Cut Bank, Mont., on Friday,
the temperature rose from 11 below at 11 a.m. to 36 above at noon.
   Temperatures also rose dramatically Saturday in western South
Dakota when a warm front moved through. By 10 a.m., Lemmon, which
had dropped to 33 below zero during the week, had a temperature of
37 above zero. Rapid City, which had a record low of 29 below zero
Friday, reached 44 above zero by early afternoon Saturday.
   Snow closed the airport at Wilmington, N.C. ``We've had 10 to 12
inches, but snow drifts are as high as 3 feet,'' said Chuck
Holtzinger of the weather service in Wilmington.
   Two inches of snow fell overnight on the coast of South
Carolina, and inland Columbia was forecast to have its first white
Christmas since 1935. Snow also fell on parts of southern Georgia.
   The airport at Savannah, Ga., also closed, because of ice and
small snowdrifts, said airport police Officer Lewis Stamper.
   The Florida Panhandle cities of Pensacola, Tallahassee,
Apalachicola, Milton and Crestview were whitened by snow overnight,
and 2 inches were forecast for Jacksonville, according to the
National Weather Service. Flurries were expected as far south as
Miami.
   Authorities closed icy roads and bridges Saturday across
northern Florida, and warned drivers to stay at home. Saturday's
low in Pensacola was 18 degrees. Tallahassee and Jacksonville both
had 31 degrees.
   Ice halted traffic on Interstate 75 between Gainesville and the
Georgia line, prompting Gov. Bob Martinez to order the National
Guard and state agencies to find shelter for stranded travelers,
Martinez spokesman Brian Ballard said.
   The airports in Jacksonville and Gainesville closed Saturday
because of ice-covered runways and several flights in and out of
Tallahassee were canceled. ``We're taking it hour-by-hour,'' said
Ron Beason, Tallahassee manager for USAir.
   ``People can't get anywhere if they wanted to, so they might as
well just stay home,'' said sheriff's spokesman Asa Higgs in
Jacksonville, a city of bridges.
   The Coast Guard rescued 27 hunters and fishermen from bayous and
marshes in southern Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi between 7 a.m.
Friday and Saturday evening, said Petty Officer Gene Maestas. One
fisherman near death from exposure told rescuers in Mississippi his
boat sank Dec. 20, Maestas said.
   In New Orleans, 98 fires, several of them major and most
probably caused by portable heaters, broke out between noon Friday
and noon Saturday, said fire department Capt. Bob Whitman.
   ``Pipes are frozen all over town,'' said Joe Giglio, a plumber
in Shreveport, La. At Complete Plumbing, Sewer and Drain Service in
the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson, 350 people called during the
first six hours of business Saturday, but four of the business's 12
plumbers couldn't get their cars started, said secretary Cynthia
Peterson.
   The cold frightened Florida farmers and citrus growers who
suffered $3 billion in damages during hard freezes in 1983 and 1985.
   Must of the citrus crop was still on the trees.
   ``We've done everything we can to protect it. We've watered it
down, got wind machines set up and flash pots fueled up and ready
to light if need be,'' said Ben Abbitt, general manager of the
Haines City Citrus Growers Cooperative, representing 7,000 acres of
citrus groves.
   ``If it gets cold enough long enough, we've got a disaster,''
said William Moon, sales manager for Zellwin Farms, which has
everything from carrots and lettuce to parsley and radishes in the
ground in northwestern Orange County.

   Nicaraguan soldiers surrounded the
U.S. Embassy again Saturday in an effort to force U.S. soldiers
searching for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to end their blockade of
Nicaragua's Embassy in Panama.
   President Daniel Ortega, who has repeatedly predicted a U.S.
invasion of Nicaragua, called for formation of ``a single Latin
American and Caribbean army to defend the sovereignty that is being
trampled in Panama.''
   ``War must be declared on the interventionist policy of the
United States,'' he said in a 30-minute speech in Chinandega, 80
miles northwest of Managua.
   ``A single army! A single army!'' the Sandinista crowd cheered.
   Several trucks full of troops and light artillery were in the
U.S. Embassy area in the southeastern part of the city.
   An officer in charge who refused to give his name called the
deployment ``routine movements'' and refused to say more.
   Asked about the troop deployment, the U.S. Embassy press
officer, Louis P. Falino Jr., said: ``I have no comment.''
   The standoff began Thursday, one day after U.S. forces invaded
Panama to topple Noriega and his Panamanian Defense Forces.
   In their search for Noriega, who escaped an attack that
decimated his headquarters, U.S. forces surrounded the Nicarguan,
Cuban and Libyan embassies in Panama City after rumors spread that
Noriega or his men were hiding there.
   Those embassies remained surrounded Saturday.
   In rataliation, Nicarguan troops supported by tanks surrounded
the U.S. Embassy in Managua all day Thursday, withdrawing that
night.
   Nicaraguan armored vehicles returned Friday night, but only for
15 minutes.
   Asked about Saturday's deployment around the U.S. Embassy,
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto told reporters the move was in
response to the U.S. military blockade of the Nicaraguan Embassy
and that the standoff would continue until the Nicaraguan mission
in Panama City was cleared.

   A freighter picked up six Cuban refugees floating
southeast of Key Largo on Saturday, then handed them over to the
Coast Guard, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   The Santa Paula, a 500-foot West German freighter en route to
Venezuela, came upon the six men late in the morning, according to
Senior Chief Petty Officer Lou Parris.
   The freighter changed course at the Coast Guard's request, and
handed the Cubans over to a Coast Guard vessel at the Miami Harbor
sea buoy late in the day, Parris said.
   The Cubans were taken to the Coast Guard's Miami Beach base,
where they were interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials.
   All six appeared to be suffering from exposure after the chilly
crossing, but otherwise were in good health, Parris said.
   The spokesman did not know what sort of craft the Cubans were
aboard when found or how far they were from Key Largo when the
freighter found them.
   Key Largo, the northernmost of the Florida Keys, is about 60
miles south of Miami.

   Police on Saturday interviewed neighbors
of a county judge and a letter carrier who delivered a package to
his apartment, but found no leads into the bomb attack that wounded
the judge, authorities said.
   Postal inspectors confirmed Saturday night that the pipe bomb
was delivered through the mail.
   Washington County Circuit Judge John P. Corderman's condition
was upgraded to good at Washington County Hospital, one day after a
pipe bomb sent shrapnel into his hand and groin and damaged his
eardrums.
   Dr. Charles Chaney said the judge's ears were still ringing from
the blast, but his hearing had improved. Corderman now suffers a 25
percent hearing loss in both ears, down from a loss of as much as
75 percent initially, Chaney said.
   ``His sense of humor remains intact,'' the physician said. ``
When told of the holes in both eardrums, he quipped, `There goes
scuba diving.'''
   Postal inspectors, agents of the FBI and the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Hagerstown police investigating
the bombing believe it wasn't related to four parcel bombs
delivered in the Southeast in the past week, Police Lt. Robert
Frick said.
   Two of those bombs exploded, killing a federal judge in a
Birmingham, Ala., suburb Dec. 16 and an alderman who was also a
civil rights attorney in Savannah on Monday.
   Bombs were found and defused last week at the Jacksonville,
Fla., chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and the federal courthouse in Atlanta. Investigators
are focusing on a possible racial motivation in those cases.
   Frick said investigators didn't have a lead theory in the
Hagerstown bombing. ``It's so early in the investigation,'' he
said. ``We haven't fixed our investigation on a particular track.
   ``From what I know, (Corderman) doesn't have any idea who may
have wanted to do this to him,'' he said.
   Frick said investigators were reviewing Corderman's cases.
   Authorities said they saw no link with the Southeast bombings,
but said the attack could have been a copycat crime.
   Authorities believe a second unexploded bomb found in the
apartment was delivered in the same package as the pipe bomb. That
bomb was disarmed, and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officers took
it and other evidence to the agency's laboratory in Rockville.
   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service confirmed that the pipe bomb,
packaged in a Christmas food gift box, was sent through the mail
and not through some other delivery service, said spokesman Paul
Griffo in Washington.
   ``It basically changes the picture of the investigation,''
Griffo said. ``Now the Postal Inspection Service will be the lead
agency in the investigation because we've determined that the bomb
arrived through the mail and not through a delivery person.''
   The inspection service stopped short, however, of naming letter
carrier Robert L. Miller Sr., the only carrier on Corderman's
route, as the person who delivered the bomb.
   Earlier Saturday, investigators interviewed Miller, who said he
delivered a flat, rectangular box to Corderman's downtown apartment
about 12:45 p.m. Friday, nearly two hours before the 2:30 p.m.
explosion. Miller said he left the box leaning against the door
when no one answered.
   The carrier said he believed the box contained perishable food
because the cardboard had a waxy, oily texture.
   ``They showed me a picture of a blown-up Hickory Farms box with
his name on it, but I don't know if I delivered a Hickory Farms box
or not. It just looked like a normal package that came from a
business,'' said Miller, 42.
   ``They keep asking me about postage and return addresses. I
don't know. I think there was a return address, but I'm not sure,''
he said.
   Doctors said the judge, who had been in stable condition after
surgery Friday to remove shrapnel, could be released from the
hospital as early as Christmas Day.
   Chaney said doctors removed pieces of lead-colored pipe from
Corderman's groin and right hand and reconstructed the top half of
the middle finger on the judge's right hand, which had lost its tip.
   Several judges and other officials visited Corderman along with
members of his family, who have declined to comment. Corderman also
refused interviews.
   ``He's in very good spirits ,'' County Circuit Judge Daniel
Moylan said. ``He's very grateful that he's alive.''
   Corderman, who had been a judge for 12 years, was known as one
of the toughest judges in the county. He was known for handing down
harsh sentences, especially in drug-related cases. He also has been
an outspoken advocate of gun control and has spoken out on
controversial issues such as club gambling.

<HEAD>Defaults Soar to $6 Billion in Junk Bond Market's Worst Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bond defaults soared to $6 billion in 1989
as the number and value of new issues sank to four-year lows in a
market battered by a weak economy and sagging corporate profits,
industry data show.
   While the $200 billion market appeared to stabilize toward
yearend, it didn't recover from an autumn bruising that sent prices
plummeting, investors fleeing and companies scrambling to meet
hefty interest payments.
   Junk bonds are so called because they are considered below
investment grade and therefore offer high yields to investors in
exchange for the higher risk of default. They have been one of the
most important tools for financing takeovers and corporate growth.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc., a credit-rating agency,
downgraded 152 junk bond issuing companies in the first 11 months
of the year, compared with 110 for all of 1988. The ratio of
downgrades to upgrades through November was 2.8, sharply higher
than 1.6 last year.
   Meanwhile, the average net asset value of junk-bond mutual funds
declined 10 percent on average this year, according to Moody's.
   ``The troubling fact is it occurred while the economy was still
growing,'' Moody's senior economist John Lonski said. ``This begs
the question of what the deterioration of junk bond credit will
look like in the event of a recession.''
   Lower credit ratings mean companies have to pay higher interest
rates to borrow money. The lower a company's credit rating, the
riskier its securities are considered.
   A Moody's report estimates that a total of $6 billion in junk
bond debt belonging to 50 companies will have entered default in
1989. That compares with an annual average of about $4 billion in
recent years.
   Among the most publicized defaults in the market that dates only
to the late-1970s were Integrated Resources Inc. at close to $1
billion and Southmark Corp. at about $700 million.
   ``The situation shows no sign of getting much better,'' Lonski
said. ``We expect that in 1990 the default rate will climb to its
1989 pace.''
   The junk bond market hit the skids in September when Campeau
Corp., which used $3 billion in junk financing to create a
retailing empire, missed some interest payments because of a cash
squeeze.
   Dollar volume of junk bond issues this year through last
Wednesday totaled $5.3 billion, down 8.6 percent from 1988 and 21
percent from the peak year of 1986, according to Securities Data Co.
   There were 131 new issues for the 1989 period, vs. 160 in 1988,
190 in 1987 and 226 in 1986, the data showed. It was the lowest
since 131 new issues in 1984.
   Lonski said RJR Nabisco Inc.'s single $4 billion issue of the
securities, used to complete the company's record $25 billion
debt-financed takeover, accounted for the biggest chunk of the new
issue value.
   He said junk bonds in 1989 were used less frequently than in
past years for traditional financing purposes such as the expansion
of business.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. remained atop the junk bond charts,
though its market share fell below 40 percent for the first time
ever. Drexel underwrote $9.7 billion in high-yield bonds through
Wednesday, Securities Data reported.
   In its ``High-Yield Review'' for December, Drexel acknowledged
the market's problems but said the difference in yields between
junk bonds and government-issued Treasury securities remained wide.
   Drexel said junk bond yields, often as much as 17 percent, still
outweighs the risk of default. Drexel long has maintained that a
diversified portfolio of junk bonds compensates for defaults.
   The firm, which pioneered the bonds through its now-indicted
former executive Michael Milken, said the government-mandated
withdrawal of savings and loans and redemptions by mutual funds
amid bad publicity hurt the market most this year.
   ``Individual investors decided to withdraw not so much on sound
credit analysis as on herd instinct,'' the Drexel report said.
   ``The general perception that there was something wrong with
`junk' bonds (the identity of the securities was now completely
separate from the companies that issued them) sank deeper into the
public consciousness,'' it said.
   The Wall Street firm, hurt by the weakness and its settlement of
unprecedented federal insider trading charges, said bad press about
high-yield defaults hurt liquidity and led mutual funds to pull out.
   ``On the other hand, these stories helped create market
imperfections from which astute investors can profit,'' Drexel
said. ``We believe that is the case today.''
