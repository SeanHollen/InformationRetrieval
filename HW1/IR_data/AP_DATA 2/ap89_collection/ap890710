<HEAD>Mexican Inflation Lowest In a Decade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico has recorded its lowest inflation rate
in a decade, and June's 1.2 percent increase in consumer prices put
the 12-month inflation rate at 17.6 percent, the Bank of Mexico
reports.
   Inflation hit an all-time high of 159.2 percent in 1987, then
dropped to 51.7 percent in 1988.
   June's was the lowest increase in the consumer price index since
July 1979 and brought inflation for the six months ending June 30 to
9.3 percent.
   It was also the lowest for a first semester since 1978, when
prices rose by an average of 8.4 percent, the bank said Sunday in
its monthly report.
   Economists tie the sharp drop in inflation to a government
agreement with labor and management instituted in late 1987 that
freezes wages and prices for an average of six months at a time and
keeps increases at a minimum.
   During the last round of talks, all three sides agreed July 1 to
raise the minimum wage by an average of 6.5 percent nationwide and
continue the program until next March, with another round of
negotiations in December.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Likes U.S. Arms Proposals, ... If</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union could accept Bush
administration proposals for trial inspections of nuclear weapons
systems, as long as more weapons are covered, and would consider
limits on multi-warhead mobile missiles, the chief Soviet arms
control spokesman is quoted as saying.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov, in a Moscow interview
reported in Tuesday editions of The Washington Post, said such
inspections ``should not prevent the normal development of
negotiations in Geneva or be a precondition for work on the draft
text and protocols. They should go hand in hand.''
   But Karpov said the Soviets want to include more weapons systems
than were envisioned in the U.S. proposal put forward in the START _
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks _ negotiations in Geneva last month
for monitoring experiments while the talks are under way.
   U.S. officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experiments
to silo-based missiles and mobile strategic missiles. Karpov,
however, was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber bases
should be included.
   The first monitoring should be of sea-launched cruise missiles,
``one of the areas where the most difficult verification problems
arise,'' he said. He suggested inspectors might visit each other's
cruise missile factories.
   Though the United States proposed continuous monitoring of
entrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles,
it has no such plants of its own.
   However, the Bush administration has proposed to put the
10-warhead MX missile on rail cars and the proposed single-warhead
Midgetman on mobile land transporters.
   Karpov said, ``If we can have inspectors at production plants for
the MX or the Midgetman, then we would be ready to have such a team
at our plant'' producing the multi-warhead SS-24, a mobile missile.
   Asked if the Soviets would consider banning or sharply limiting
such missiles, Karpov said, ``I think that can be considered.''
   He said the Soviet Union might also accept a ban on nuclear
cruise missiles of any range, instead of numerical limits on the
long-range strategic variety it has put forward, ``If we can find
efficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclear
weapons in a way that won't harm U.S. and Soviet security
interests.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-eight years ago, Charles Tasnadi left
his native Hungary on his belly, scrabbling a tortuous path to
freedom through frozen minefields and waves of barbed wire. He will
return, Tuesday, on Air Force One.
   As George Bush pays the first visit to Budapest by an American
president, Tasnadi, 64, an Associated Press photographer, will be
with him to capture that moment on film. He will record an even more
special moment in his heart.
   ``When the military band strikes up the Star Spangled Banner
during the arrival ceremonies at the Kossuth statue (a monument to
the Hungarian hero who fought the Hapsburgs) in Budapest, I will
remember a small boy scout standing at that same statue,'' he said.
   And ``I will also remember that following World War II, my church
choir was forbidden by the Stalinist (puppet) regime to sing the
U.S. national anthem to thank America for its postwar help.''
   Tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his
sweetheart, Maria, seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the
1950-51 winter to seek a new life. A championship skier, he
concocted a story about heading for the slopes, sharing the truth
only with his mother, who, by design, would report him missing two
days later.
   Joining a group of six other adults and two children _ one of
whom Tasnadi carried on his shoulders during the final, nightlong
leg across the border _ the couple slipped into Austria, eluded more
Soviet guards in the 50-mile Soviet zone of that nation, and made it
to Salzburg several days later.
   They nearly didn't. The other child, carried by another man, had
to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting the
guards. ``And it was so miserably cold,'' Tasnadi recalls. ``Twice I
fell through the ice up to my chest. I couldn't even feel it. When
we got to a house on the Austrian side, I kicked off my brand new
shoes so they would dry out. When I woke up, they were so shriveled
up I couldn't use them.''
   He and Maria were quickly married in Salzburg, but their dream of
raising a family in the United States was at first stymied by
immigration authorities. So they moved to Venezuela instead, where
Tasnadi's newspaper photography eventually drew the AP's attention
and an invitation to join the news service in the United States. He
was assigned to the Washington bureau in 1964, and has worked there
since.
   Twice over the years Maria has returned to Hungary, but Tasnadi,
torn by conflicting emotions, kept postponing the trip. His mother,
now deceased, had long since emigrated to the United States. ``I
finally said, `OK, this is the year I go,'' he said. ``Then, it
wasn't two weeks before I got the assignment to go with the
president of the United States.'' Maria will stay behind.
   Prior assignment have taken him to the Soviet Union, Cuba and
other communist nations, and the Castro government has accorded him
several unusual photo privileges out of respect for his work.
``Since I became an American citizens, I try to be very polite to
the Soviet bloc,'' he said. ``I want to be sure of my objectivity.
I've never tried to make a bad picture of any communist leader. ...
The only time I talk politics is when I vote.''
   But Tasnadi's love of the United States is legion among
Washington circles. An American flag adorns his mailbox, and despite
his courtly manners ``he will fight you if you say anything bad
about his country or his flag,'' says Toby Massey, Washington
assistant chief of bureau for newsphotos.
   Massey recalled that when Tasnadi was about to take his
citizenship test in 1968, ``Charlie was a nervous wreck. He studied
so hard, and had everybody giving him spot quizzes.'' Another AP
photographer, Henry Burroughs, accompanied Tasnadi to the courtroom
as his sponsor. As it turned out, said Massey, the judge was a
college roommate of Burroughs _ and didn't ask Tasnadi a single
question.
   Other anecdotes abound about the Americanization of Tasnadi. When
he was first assigned to cover a baseball game, he quickly surmised
that the best action occurred around second base. So he promptly
walked onto the field, and took his position just feet from the bag.
   At a professional football game, a perplexed Tasnadi kept
glancing skyward as he paced the sidelines. When a colleague asked
him why, Tasnadi pointed to the ``ball on'' section of the
scoreboard and said, ``I can't find the balloon.''
   And during a national political convention, Tasnadi's assignment
editor ordered him to relieve a colleague, Ray Stubblebine, who had
taken ill on one of the photo towers in the hall. ``Go over there
and spell Stubblebine,'' the editor demanded. Tasnadi didn't move.
``Damn it, Charlie, I said go over there and spell Stubblebine,''
the editor barked.
   ``I'm sorry,'' said Tasnadi. ``If I can't spell it here, I can't
spell it over there.''
   Professionally, Tasnadi gets most things right. He was won
several White House Press Photographers awards, and counts several
presidents among his friends. Once, in Vail, Colo., he got a knock
on his door at 2 a.m. ``Mr. Tasnadi,'' said his caller, ``the
president would be honored if you could ski with him tomorrow.''
   Riding up the chairlift with Gerald R. Ford, Tasnadi recalled,
``I thought, `My God, if anybody would have told me when I was
waiting, with that little boy in my arms, to cross that minefield.
that one day I would be riding up a mountain with the president of
the United States ... Oh, my God.''
   Despite the trend toward more political tolerance in Hungary,
Tasnadi still confesses some apprehension about his emotional
readiness for his first return to his homeland. ``My worst fear,''
he said, tears welling in his eyes, ``is an evening at an old
restaurant in Budapest, with a glass of Tokay served to the strains
of violins. That could prove to be disastrous.''
   Asked what picture he would like to shoot most in Hungary, he
replied: ``There are so many. But when I see that statue of Lajos
Kossuth ... before the war, I was chosen as one of two little boy
scouts who would go there on weekends and stand at attention for two
hours, as honor guard. And now, the president will go there. When I
see that statue again ...''
   His tears finished the sentence.

<HEAD>Officials Warn Against Bathing In Algae-Tainted Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunbathers on Italy's Adriatic coast can stay in the
sun, but may well have to keep out of the water due to an explosion
of thick, slimy algae.
   Last August, the algae growth prompted authorities to call
bathing uninviting. This July, they're calling it potentially
dangerous.
   Authorities in the Romagna region, which includes popular seaside
resorts such as Rimini, on Saturday called bathing ``impractical,''
and urge tourists to wait for the results of an algae analysis due
today.
   If the tests confirm that the waters are dangerous, bathing will
be banned, tourism officials said.
   Last year, the algae invaded Italy's northern Adriatic coast,
scaring away tourists and killing fish. The algae thrive on raw
sewage and chemical pollutants that dirty the Italian waters.
   An official prohibition on bathing could deal a heavy blow to the
tourism industry.

<DATELINE>NEWKIRK, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews chip away old paint and hack at
knee-high weeds at the abandoned Chilocco Indian School, seemingly
unaffected by the tempest brewing in this remote corner of Oklahoma.
   When a California group received state permission for a 75-bed
drug and alcohol treatment center, Newkirk thought the project on
the reservation six miles away would solve local economic troubles
brought on by oil and farming slumps.
   But the initial euphoria, like the old paint, has chipped away,
replaced by distrust, frustration, even fear.
   Townspeople say Narconon International hasn't been honest about
its affiliation with the Church of Scientology, its financing, its
medical credentials and its plans for the project, which will draw
mostly out-of-state clients.
   They say Narconon denied the project had anything to do with
Scientology until Newkirk officials turned up a Scientology magazine
with a story headlined ``Trained Scientologists to Staff Huge
Oklahoma Facility.''
   And the mayor says Narconon tried to dupe locals at a staged
ceremony, where a $200,000 check and a glowing study were presented
to Narconon by a group that turned out to be part of Narconon itself.
   Now the town fears it could earn a ``cult image'' because of the
project's ties to Scientology, which follows the teachings of the
late science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Former members have
accused Scientology of fraud and mental abuse, and the Internal
Revenue Service has challenged its tax-exempt status as a religion.
   ``People interested in coming to this town will see the Church of
Scientology thing _ the cult thing _ and I think that that image
will hurt our possibilities for growth and development,'' Mayor
Garry Bilger said in an interview last month.
   Some townspeople say they worry about the kind of people the
project will attract and that the stately 80-building campus, built
of native Oklahoma stone and tucked more than a mile off the nearest
road, will become a Scientology recruiting station.
   ``I don't think any of us are against drug abusers getting
rehabilitation,'' said Mike Clifton, pastor of the First Christian
Church. ``(But) there's a lot of concern in the community because we
really don't know what these folks are exactly about. What really
worries us is what they're not saying.''
   In the basement of the First Baptist Church, pastor Mark Jones is
making copies of a videotape of a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary on Scientology, which he showed to his congregation at a
worship service.
   The tapes, along with Scientology literature, have been
circulating in this town of 2,400. There have been town meetings and
public forums, including a sometimes heated session with state
officials who approved the Narconon project before the town knew it
was supported by Scientology.
   ``The town got the shaft,'' said insurance agent Charles
Eisenhauer. ``I don't think anybody can undo anything that's been
done so far.'' The center is scheduled to open in September.
   Narconon officials say Newkirk's concern is inflated and
unwarranted. Narconon is a legitimate, worldwide drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program with 23 years' experience and an 86 percent
success rate, they assert.
   Narconon spokesman Gary Smith said he tried to reassure the town
that Narconon's ``sole intention is to get people off drugs.'' He
said the town has been misled.
   ``There's fear being put into the town by false information being
fed in there by somebody who's in favor of drug abuse. They're
either connected to selling drugs or they're using drugs,'' Smith
said.
   Smith declined to be more specific about the identity or
whereabouts of these ``outside sources with criminal motives.''
   ``Trust me, I know,'' he said.
   Another Narconon attempt at persuasion provoked an angry response.
   In a letter printed May 18 on the front page of the weekly
Newkirk Herald Journal, Narconon president John Duff wrote: ``There
will be those that will not want Narconon to succeed at Chilocco
because they are for drugs and are on the other side in the battle
against drugs.''
   Jones, the Baptist minister, responded the following week,
writing he ``resented the implication, or more accurately the
accusation, that was made by Narconon's Mr. Duff. He accused me of
supporting illegal drug use in our area if I did not swallow his
program hook, line and sinker.''
   Bilger said he had been so optimistic about the promise of a
revitalized Chilocco that last December he wrote Oklahoma health
officials supporting Narconon.
   But the mayor said his winter hope turned to disillusionment by
spring when he learned of Narconon's history, and he came to believe
he had been misled when Narconon held an emotional ceremony April 8
in which the Association for Better Living and Education presented a
glowing study of Narconon and the $200,000 check.
   Later Bilger learned that ABLE shared a street address in Los
Angeles with Narconon, and is identified in a Scientology magazine
as part of Narconon.
   ``They totally misrepresented what was going on,'' Bilger said.
   ``I came away with the impression that we had an independent
group here interested in mankind and they had researched the
Narconon process. Then I find out ABLE and Narconon are part of the
same organization,'' he said.
   ``I try to be straightforward, and when somebody dosn't do that,
I wonder why.''
   In late June, Narconon's Smith used a copy of Bilger's December
letter of support to suggest to The Associated Press that the mayor
supported Narconon.
   Bilger says the December letter no longer reflects his feelings.
   ``I imagine if I was in his shoes I'd use it, too,'' Bilger said.
``I just think now it (Narconon) is a problem and if all the facts
were out at the time, things might have been done differently.''
   The Chilocco Indian School closed in 1980 and was declared
surplus property by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which turned
control over to five Indian tribes _ Ponca, Kaw, Pawnee,
Otoe-Missouria and Tonkawa.
   Last year, Narconon invited representatives of tribes throughout
the country to a meeting in Clearwater, Fla. Narconon touted its
program and said it was looking for a site for a treatment center.
Currently, Narconon's only U.S. inpatient center is a Los Angeles
clinic with 12 beds.
   A Ponca representative told Narconon about the Chilocco site. The
25-year lease eventually drawn up offers the tribes a percentage of
gross earnings, up to $16 million. The tribal leadership remains
enthusiastic about the Narconon project.
   In January, the Oklahoma Health Planning Commission gave Narconon
approval for an initial 75 beds. The group seeks 150 beds, with
growth projected to 400.
   Robert Lobsinger, publisher of the weekly Herald Journal, was by
then becoming curious about Narconon. In Newkirk's tiny library he
found articles about ties to Scientology and past run-ins with
officials. His first story, published April 27 under the headline
``Chilocco Drug Treatment Center May Be Part of Notorious Religious
Cult,'' set the town abuzz.
   Townspeople said they have repeatedly asked Narconon what medical
credentials they have, and so far, have received no answer.
   ``My first question is, do they think that everyone down here is
stupid?'' said Jones. ``People around here are not world travelers,
but they've got a lot of common sense and they ask a lot of
questions.
   ``We've encountered deceit from the beginning,'' he said. ``There
have been smoke screens everywhere, and there have been flat-out
lies.''

   Elvis Presley wore blue suede shoes to his high
school prom, but he and his date didn't dance.
   ``Elvis told me he didn't know how to dance,'' said Regis Wilson
Vaughn, the future king's date at the 1953 L.C. Humes High School
prom in Memphis, Tenn.
   ``So we sat and talked and drank Cokes all night.''
   Elvis, then an 18-year-old senior and still a few years from
pelvis-swinging stardom, lived in the same housing project as
Vaughn, then 14. They dated for about four months.
   Now 50, Vaughn is married and lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She
talked about her dream dates with Elvis in this week's People
magazine.
   ``I kissed Elvis every night from the second date on,'' she said.
``But the nuns at my school told us we shouldn't allow boys to kiss
us with their mouths open.
   ``So I'll just say Elvis gave me long kisses prom night. You
could say we made out. But he never tried to go farther. He wasn't
like that.''
   Vaughn said she and her family moved from Memphis a few weeks
after the prom and she never saw Presley again.
   Presley died in 1977.

   Medieval history buffs donned armor and
brandished bamboo swords in a midsummer's escape into the past.
   About 225 members of the Society for Creative Anachronism
gathered this weekend at Bong Recreational Area for archery,
leatherworking, shield bending and seminars in the history of the
Middle Ages.
   Assuming ersatz medieval names like Lord Aeddan ab Rhys, M'Lady
Brigit, and Anna-Maria Taubeneck, the fighters crossed swords and
matched jousting skills in battles whose only prize was honor.
   Patricia Craig, a computer programmer, was one of the organizers.
   As its name suggests, the group does not take itself too
seriously, she said.
   ``We learn to overlook non-Middle Ages stuff in our midst, like
lights and plumbing,'' she said. And ``we are much more into honor,
chivalry and courtesy than they were.''
   Ms. Craig said close to 30,000 people nationally are involved in
the movement to remember and recreate the Middle Ages.

   Ellie Mae, who as the mascot of the 1988
Republican National Convention rubbed noses with the powerful, is
giving the cold shoulder to her fellow pachyderms.
   ``Ellie Mae's wary around other elephants,'' said James Holston,
the elephant supervisor at the Audubon zoo. ``She's kind of
stand-offish and shy because she's not used to them.
   ``She's more used to people than elephants,'' Holston said.
   The African elephant, captured in 1986 and sent from Zimbabwe to
New Orleans before August's convention, was trained to get along in
crowds of people.
   ``We started by taking her out when the zoo wasn't open,''
Holston said. ``Then we took her around to be with people.''
   By the end of August, she'd been on three television networks'
morning shows, had been presented to then-President Reagan and Vice
President Bush and invited to countless soirees.
   Ellie Mae, a 3-year-old, 1,200-pound youngster when she arrived
in New Orleans, has gained 400 pounds and stands nearly 5 feet tall
at the shoulder.
   She's still a hit on the party circuit and is part of the zoo's
campaign to educate people about the poaching of elephants for ivory
and the danger they may become extinct.
   Ellie Mae has her own quarters but soon may be penned with the
other elephants.
   The transition from star to one of the herd is a gradual one,
Holston said.

   He was one of professional football's mightiest
men, a 295-pound monster who could bench press twice his weight.
Now, Steve Courson is thrilled to lift 15-pound dumbbells and climb
a flight of stairs.
   The former offensive lineman, now only 33 years old, suffers from
cardiomyopathy, a mysterious disease that turns heart muscle into
flab and eventually kills its victims unless they undergo a
transplant.
   Though his doctors can't blame Courson's condition on his long,
heavy use of anabolic steroids, they can't rule it out. Neither can
he.
   ``There are so many ironies about my situation. That's why I
can't discard them as being an accident. Why is all this ironically
happening to me? I've had two strikes. Strike three you're out.''
   Courson, formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, is believed to be the first professional athlete to be
put on the waiting list for a heart transplant after years of taking
illegally obtained anabolic steroids.
   Experts fear more may follow.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised. I think it's going to happen,'' said
transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh. ``It might be liver disease that comes out of those
things, too.''
   ``The potential health hazard and the impact on the national
health care system ... it's very frightening,'' said Harvard
University's Dr. Lyle Micheli, president of the American College of
Sports Medicine.
   It also raises an ethical question for transplant surgeons: With
a scarcity of organs, should people who take harmful drugs be given
lower priority?
   Anabolic steroids, fast becoming the scourge of sports, are
derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. They stimulate
development of bone, muscle and skin. Admitted users include
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, whose 1988 Olympics gold medal was
withdrawn after he tested positive for the drugs.
   Courson first took anabolic steroids in 1974 before his sophomore
year at the University of South Carolina. In four weeks, he went
from 230 pounds to a solid 260. He continued the off-season habit
after being drafted by the Steelers in 1977 and playing on two Super
Bowl teams.
   Not long after being traded to the Buccaneers in 1984, Courson
boasted a 60-inch chest and 22-inch biceps and was pressing up to
605 pounds. ``Anyone who's trained with weights or trained that
seriously at world-class level realizes those types of gains don't
occur by eating Wheaties.''
   At one point, Courson was shelling out $1,500 a year for
steroids, ``not that big a tradeoff when you're making $300,000 a
year,'' he said.
   In March 1985, in the midst of an 1,800 milligram-a-week regimen,
his highest ever, Buccaneers doctors told him he had an irregular
heartbeat. The problem cleared up in two weeks with medication, and
Courson quit taking steroids for the next year.
   At the end of the 1985 season, Courson lost his starting job. He
took his last dose of anabolic steroids before the Buccaneers'
training camp in 1986 in hopes of getting off the bench. ``I wanted
to maintain a competitive edge and I realize it had to do with my
age, too, the wear and tear on the body.''
   Courson was waived at the start of the season, got no other
offers, and retired. He lived in Wyoming and Florida, then returned
to the Pittsburgh area in early 1988 to finish his autobiography and
train as a professional wrestler.
   On Nov. 23, 1988, Courson went to Allegheny General Hospital for
what he thought was an ulcer. It turned out to be cardiomyopathy.
   For years, doctors have warned of the immediate side effects of
steroids: acne, sexual dysfunction, rashes and unusually aggressive
behavior known in the trade as ``'roid rage.'' Less is known about
long-term effects, although animal tests suggest the drugs
accelerate cardiovascular disease.
   ``Anybody who's used steroids and has any malady, it's
immediately assumed steroids caused it. We haven't even done those
studies yet,'' said Dr. Charles Yesalis of Pennsylvania State
University.
   ``We don't know frankly what is the bottom line,'' said Dr.
Judith Orie, Courson's cardiologist. ``But we do know anabolic
steroids cause high blood pressure in patients. High blood pressure
after a point in time causes the heart to fail.''
   Also, ``steroids can alter the immune system. We don't know
whether that has played a role and allowed a virus to affect his
heart or not,'' Orie said.
   Complicating matters is the fact that doctors don't always know
what causes cardiomyopathy.
   ``There are many people who have cardiomyopathy and had nothing
to do with steroids,'' said Dr. Barry Maron of the National
Institutes of Health. ``That's the problem there is in establishing
a connection in this one person. It's a very iffy kind of thing
(although) I'm not saying it's impossible.''
   About 40 percent of all heart transplants are performed on
cardiomyopathy patients, said Dr. Michael Kaye of the University of
California at San Diego, who keeps the international registry of
heart, heart-lung and lung transplants, which stood at 11,181 in
late June. The vast majority _ 10,154 _ were straight heart
transplants.
   There were 1,223 people awaiting heart transplants in the United
States as of June 26, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing.
   ``The transplant community is concerned (about steroids) because
of the tremendous need for organs and lack of donors,'' Kaye said.
   Courson, who has been on the list since March 31, could wait a
long time because of his body size. Doctors give him two years
without a transplant.
   Experimental heart medication has enabled the 6-foot-1{ Courson
to go from an all-time adult low of 225 pounds late last year to 255
pounds. It has also allowed him to stay in shape by walking
treadmills and lifting light weights three times a week at Allegheny
General's cardiac rehabilitation laboratory.
   Because of the scarcity of organs, some people quietly wonder
whether former steroid users should get the same priority as
individuals who never took illicit drugs. Transplant doctors,
however, say they merely take into account patients' current
lifestyles and ability to maintain healthy habits.
   Cigarette smokers and alcoholics, for instance, usually are told
they must stop before they can be considered for transplantation.
That's no guarantee, however, that they will stop for good.
   Arthur McDonald Sr., 53, of Schenectady, N.Y., ended a 30-year
cigarette habit before being put on the heart transplant waiting
list at Presbyterian-University Hospital of Pittsburgh. About a year
after his 1985 transplant, he was smoking again. He says he plans to
quit as soon as he loses 30 more pounds.
   ``They weren't very happy. I'm not happy with myself,'' he said.
``You've got a second chance at life and the cigarettes aren't going
to add to it.''
   Doctors say they extract a promise and hope for the best.
   ``We really need that commitment,'' Starzl said. ``But just
because someone drank in the past, just because Steve Courson once
took steroids so he could compete, I don't believe should be
determining factors.
   ``I think he's been punished plenty.''
   Courson feels no shame or guilt being on the waiting list.
   ``Everyone's got their faults. But when you were doing something
that you got paid for and was glorified, are you totally to be
blamed?''

   Samuel F. Pickering Jr. is not above telling
a lie to make a good story better, and he encourages the students in
his writing course to do the same.
   ``You've got to lie to give the illusion of truth,'' the English
professor tells his students at the University of Connecticut.
   Given that philosophy, it's not surprising that Pickering finds
himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by
a former student. The teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams
in the movie ``Dead Poets Society,'' is modeled after Pickering.
   Like Keating, Pickering has been known to do the unusual in his
classroom. He's lectured from a desktop, from outside a window or
while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet. He also returned to
his prep school as a young teacher after studying in England. But
unlike the movie, there was never any conflict between Pickering and
school administrators, and he left the school on good terms.
   ``Whatever of me is in that character has got to be small,'' the
47-year-old Pickering said during recent interview at his home. ``I
was a kid and he was a child. Twenty-three years ago. How much of me
could there be in the movie? Not very much.''
   The screenplay was written by Tom Schulman, who was a 15-year-old
student at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tenn., when he took
a course from Pickering. Pickering, who had returned to the United
States after a year of study at Cambridge University, taught at the
private school for just one year, 1965-66.
   Schulman has acknowledged Pickering's influence on his life and
the screenplay, and has said much of his love for language and
literature originated in that course.
   Pickering hasn't seen the movie _ his three children were sick
and now he's in Canada for the summer. But many of his friends in
Nashville have seen the film, and they immediately recognized
Pickering as the inspiration for the movie's teacher. The friends
began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject.
   ``I don't mind being the center of attention if I can control it,
but I can't control this,'' he said of the numerous inquiries he's
received from reporters and acquaintances.
   Pickering, who was born and raised in Nashville, is puzzled as to
why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that
his friends so readily saw him in the movie. He's also flattered.
   ``I'm the most ordinary guy in the world,'' he said as he draped
his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of
his jeans. ``Sometimes people remember me, and I don't know why. I
don't know if I did anything special then as a teacher. I was young
and lively.''
   What he does in class is unplanned, he said. He does many unusual
things to get his students to think for themselves, but a bad back
has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures. His
classroom is also on the second floor now, making the leaps from
windows unwise.
   ``Sometimes you get bored in the classroom,'' he said. ``This
semester when my class was over, the last class, two girls in my
class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the
class. They got A's. You'd think they might get F's, but I've
learned since.''
   Pickering bursts into laughter after telling the story. He laughs
often and easily as he recalls the past. He finds many things
humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments.
   Since leaving Montgomery Bell Academy, he has completed a
doctorate and taught in Syria and Jordon and at Dartmouth College.
He's been at the University of Connecticut since 1978, where in
addition to teaching, he's become well-known as an essayist.
   He writes about his three children, his wife, his mother and
father and ordinary things in life. His writing, as might be
expected, is humorous and self-critical, but also bawdy and
philosophical. He has published three books of his essays and is
working on a fourth. He plans to write an essay on the celebrity
that has come to him in the wake of ``Dead Poets Society.''
   His most recent book, ``May Days'' (University of Iowa, 1988),
includes an essay on Montgomery Bell Academy. It pokes fun at the
idea of a ``Southern gentleman'' and Pickering's exploits as a
student, athlete and practical joker.
   From these experiences, Pickering has shaped a teaching
philosophy that has in turn influenced many others.
   ``There are very few givens that I accept. I don't reject any
either. But I think that kids ought to start looking,'' Pickering
said. ``When somebody says it's green, then you should turn around
and say maybe it's not green. What's the truth? That's all I do.''

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari broke
tradition at the beginning of his term: He made no dramatic
announcement about fighting corruption in Mexico's government and
business.
   To the astonishment of cynics, he took action instead _ jailing
oil union leaders, stockbrokers and dozens of drug-running police on
corruption charges.
   But his message hasn't penetrated Mexico's bureaucracy, where a
bribe still can be expected to renew a visa, obtain a trade permit
or connect a telephone line.
   ``Now, there's confusion,'' said one business analyst. ``People
believe Salinas' people are clean, but they're still dealing with
some of the same middle-level officials. They don't know what to
do.''
   For most public servants, the opportunity to earn a decent wage
comes once in a lifetime. With no career civil service and no merit
system guaranteeing promotions, tens of thousands lose their jobs at
each change of administration.
   While padding slim government incomes is not unique to Mexico,
under the authoritarian system that has governed the country since
before the time of the Spanish Conquest, corruption spread well
beyond the economic arena.
   It has hurt the nation's pride, tarnished elections and in some
instances claimed lives. An internal government study estimated that
federal highway police bribes cost the economy $3 million a day.
   ``The authoritarian nature of government lends itself to
corruption,'' said Samuel del Villar, an adviser to former President
Miguel de la Madrid and political scientist at the Colegio de
Mexico. ``Without accountability to the people, officials enjoy the
discretional authority to impose bribes and arbitrary fees.''
   Salinas, inaugurated Dec. 1, inherited a monumental task from de
la Madrid, who took office in 1982 amid growing perception that
corruption _ fed by the sudden wealth to be had in the oil-boom
years _ was out of control and had infected the private sector.
   ``To get the commerce department to authorize a price increase
for a product used to mean leaving an envelope behind,'' said the
business analyst, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``You'd
take up a collection from other businesses before you went.''
   De la Madrid decreed a law, prepared by del Villar and a team of
legal experts, that extended criminal liability for corrupt
practices by public servants. It was the heart of de la Madrid's
``moral renovation'' campaign against corruption, and it failed.
   ``Moral renovation failed because no one bothered to apply the
public servants law,'' del Villar said. ``Indictments were
discretional, and in this case no one wanted to do it.''
   Salinas abandoned ``moral renovation'' and ordered the arrests
that so far have netted Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, the longtime
chief of the powerful oil workers union; Eduardo Legoretta, a top
businessman charged with stock market fraud, and dozens of police
agents in northwestern Mexico alleged to have closed their eyes to
drug trafficking.
   Salinas' attorney general on April 27 ordered the arrest of
Carlos Robles Loustaunau, who stepped down as mayor of Hermosillo,
and three aides on charges of getting themselves elected last July
through fraud. They are members of Salinas' own Institutional
Revolutionary Party, commonly known as PRI, its Spanish initials.
   Taking their cue from Salinas and his drive to modernize Mexico's
economy, some Mexican business leaders have openly attacked official
bribe-taking.
   ``We are tired of corruption,'' Jorge Ocejo Moreno, president of
the National Association of Industries in Transformation, declared
in April.
   Treasury, health, commerce and other federal department officials
``extort us without end,'' he asserted.
   To Salinas, both bureaucrats and private sector leaders are to
blame for corruption that saps the economy and his own plans to
generate growth.
   Salinas has promised measures to crack down on police corruption
and to professionalize Mexico's police forces.
   As budget director under de la Madrid, Salinas helped change the
system of import licenses that encouraged corruption; other
deregulatory changes have also helped reduce the number of rules
that can lead to extortion or bribery.
   Salinas also has laid down the law on chronic tax evasion by
decreeing a 2 percent tax on business assets. Vociferous business
protests have been largely ignored.
   Even so, the roll call of corruption in Mexico remains long and
varied:
   _Proud host of the 1986 World Cup soccer championship, Mexico
won't field a team in the 1990 games. It was caught red-handed with
four over-age players in an international youth tourney last year.
   _Salinas' own election was the most disputed in the 60-year
history of the PRI. Salinas won just over half the vote, but reports
abounded of multiple-voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud.
   _Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico City in December ordered
all car owners in the capital to have their vehicles tested to fight
the city's smog, generally considered the world's worst. Almost
immediately, inspectors began passing polluting cars for fees
ranging up to double the price of testing.
   _Two Acapulco judges were suspended in December and face trial on
charges of accepting a $200,000 bribe to order the release from
prison of Alejandro Braun Diaz, a 34-year-old playboy convicted of
raping and killing a 6-year-old girl. Braun is believed to have fled
to Canada.
   _On Dec. 11, explosions and fire ripped through a crowded Mexico
City street market, killing 62 people. Residents blamed tons of
illegal fireworks sold at the market and said police had been bribed
to ignore the threat. ``The government allowed them to sell here,''
said a woman whose parents died in the blast.

   Day after day, year after year,
Venezuelans read or hear of official corruption, but not a single
person has ever been convicted, at least no one from the political
establishment.
   Corruption seems so deeply rooted and may have gained so many
adherents in Venezuela, the author Arturo Uslar Pietri suggests,
that the honest should regarded as fools.
   ``Normal in Venezuela is to take advantage of a political
position to obtain personal benefits and become rich,'' he said in
an interview. ``Those who don't do it are considered inferiors.''
   But corruption cases in Venezuela become so entangled that few
can sort them out and in the end they fade away in a loss of
interest by a confused public.
   The latest case involves elimination of a government agency known
as Recadi, which in the previous government distributed $40 billion
for subsidized imports.
   Of that amount, some $6 billion is said to have been granted
fraudulently, mostly by overpricing, personal connections or even
outright bribery, contributing to the depletion of the nation's
monetary reserves.
   In a swirl of charges and counter charges, one figure in the
scandal attempted suicide; the leftist past of the judge handling
the case was brought into play with implications that he is acting
for political reasons; the judge sent an industrialist to jail for
eight days for charging that the judge himself took bribes and for
blaming the Recadi fraud on a former president and his sweetheart
secretary.
   Recadi was created in early 1983 as Venezuela's oil bonanza began
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed. Cheap dollars were
lavishly granted via Recadi to both private and public companies for
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation.
   But it soon became a ``nest of corruption ... that was
practically designed for fraud,'' congressional investigators have
charged.
   A thorough investigation, however, might take years just to check
the 14,000 or so companies that received cheap dollars.
   In one case, millions of dollars were granted to import Holstein
heifers to improve Venezuela's dairy stock. The heifers turned out
not to be Holsteins but ``scrawny, feeble specimens,'' as one
rancher described them.
   Hundreds of the heifers were abandoned on a plain to become
carrion for vultures, the newspaper El Nacional reported.
   In another incident, Ana Teresa Herrera was fired as a Recadi
inspector when she began investigating a company that had been
granted $14 million to import three airplanes; only one was brought
to Venezuela.
   ``And that plane never flew,'' she told reporters after
testifying before Judge Luis Guillermo de la Riva, who is in charge
of the current Recadi case.
   The scandal became a drama when former Development Minister
Hector Meneses, whose office also granted cheap dollars for imports,
shot himself in the head. He survived but lost the sight of one eye
and remains in a coma in a Caracas hospital, unable to tell what he
knows.
   Before shooting himself, Meneses wrote a letter to his wife
claiming innocence and suggesting he had merely carried out
instructions from two of his former colleagues. They, in turn, also
claimed innocence.
   So far only eight people have been jailed to await trial,
although de la Riva has issued 32 arrest warrants.
   In a setback for the judge, however, it turned out that most of
subjects of the warrants had resigned from their business jobs long
before Recadi was even created and no longer live in Venezuela.
   Then de la Riva also came under the fire of critics who recalled
that he had, years before, supported leftist guerrillas. The
implication was that it was more than coincidence that leftist
congressmen were leading the public outcry in the case.
   Another setback for the judge was his order for the arrest of
Nicomedes Zuloaga, member of a prominent Venezuelan family and
president of Gramoven, a grain processing company accused of
importing overpriced wheat.
   Upon turning himself in, Zuloaga noted that he was Venezuela's
ambassador to Argentina when the alleged overpricing took place. A
friend, Alfredo Paul Delfino, accused the judge of receiving bribes
and charged that former President Jaime Lusinchi and his private
secretary and companion, Blanca Ibanez, were ``the real thieves.''
   De la Riva ordered Delfino to jail for eight days.
   Lusinchi, whose affair with Ibanez and his attempt to divorce his
wife of more than 40 years constituted a scandal in his years as
president, has threatened to file suit against Delfino.
   ``In the Recadi case there is a too much transparent classism,''
the independent newspaper El Universal said in an editorial. ``There
are no politicians in jail and the (law's) hand strikes only on
businessmen whereas the ones to blame for the corruption were within
Recadi.''
   As the plot becomes more entangled, many believe that behind the
scandal lies a political struggle between Lusinchi and President
Carlos Andres Perez, who took office in February, for the leadership
of their Accion Democratica, the biggest in Venezuela.

   Within hours after he became Colombia's
police commander, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla had launched the
toughest anti-cocaine operation ever seen here. The effort has
earned him praise, and reportedly a $1 million contract on his life.
   Gomez replaced Gen. Jose Guillermo Medina Sanchez on Jan. 25.
Medina is under investigation for cocaine trafficking.
   Two hours after Gomez took over, he put into action Operation
Springtime, hitting drug traffickers where it hurts most _
destroying chemicals needed to make cocaine. He is beating all
records for destruction of chemicals and seizing of drugs.
   By Friday, police had destroyed 1,618,722 gallons of liquid
chemicals at clandestine labs, according to information from the
federal police department's anti-narcotics division. That outpaced
the 936,171 gallons destroyed by Colombian authorities all last
year, the division said.
   Even more impressive, police said they have destroyed more than
3.5 million pounds of solid chemicals in five months, five times
what was seized in 1988.
   Under his anti-corruption campaign, 1,000 of Colombia's 80,000
police officer's have been fired, said a colonel who works for
Gomez. One police colonel was caught with 884 pounds of cocaine in
his car.
   Gomez has gained scant public attention, but a U.S. Embassy
source said embassy officials and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents are awed by his work.
   The Medellin cartel, which includes the country's biggest cocaine
traffickers, has a $1 million contract to kill Gomez, an officer
with the narcotics intelligence division told The Associated Press.
   Gomez is never seen in public and takes a helicopter even for
short hops inside Bogota, a city of 6 million people.
   Murder for hire is common in Colombia. Gunmen, paid by drug
traffickers, have killed a justice minister, an attorney general, 30
judges, two newspaper editors and scores of police officers and
soldiers.
   Twelve members of Colombia's Supreme Court were killed three
years ago when guerrillas took over the Palace of Justice in Bogota.
The government said the guerrillas were working with drug smugglers
and destroyed hundreds of files on drug trafficking.
   Last month, a car bomb exploded as a bullet resistant car
carrying the chief of Colombia's investigative police was passing by
on a Bogota street.
   Six people were killed. The police general, Miguel Maza, was only
slightly hurt. Drug traffickers had planned the attempted
assassination, Maza said.
   Gomez apparently has the backing of President Virgilio Barco, who
forced Gomez's predecessor out.
   Gomez is increasing the strength of the narcotics division from
2,000 to 3,000 police officers in the next few months, his aides
said.
   Narcotics police, putting machine guns on old Bell 206 and 212
helicopters, are hitting cocaine laboratories with 20-man
detachments.
   Gomez switched the focus from seizing cocaine and cocaine base,
which labs had quickly replaced after confiscations, to taking the
chemicals needed to refine the drug, a high-ranking narcotics
officer said.
   But his men also have destroyed 37,243 pounds of cocaine and
cocaine base in five months, the narcotics police said. Last year,
police got 49,715 pounds.
   Despite the efforts, anti-drug force, which receive $15 million
in U.S. aid, appear outgunned by a multibillion-dollar drug empire
with jet planes, modern armaments and the ability to bribe or
intimidate scores of politicians.
   The air force does not have planes equipped to carry chemicals
long distances to dump on and to destroy coca patches in Colombia's
eastern jungles. One pilot compared the effort to eradicate drugs to
trying to put out a forest fire with a fire extinguisher.

<TEXT>
   The tanker responsible for the nation's worst
oil spill limps into San Diego Bay for repairs Tuesday, rejected as
a pollution risk elsewhere but a welcome buoy to this city's
foundering shipbuilding industry.
   The ruptured Exxon Valdez is expected to generate about 300 extra
jobs at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. under a repair
contract from Exxon Shipping Co. worth about $25 million.
   The Valdez, built at the shipyard in 1986, ripped its hull open
March 24 on Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil poured into the sound, polluting parks
and fishing areas and killing wildlife.
   ``I think San Diegans are as disturbed about the oil spill as
anyone,'' said Max Schetter, director of the Chamber of Commerce's
Economic Research Bureau.
   ``But despite the disaster, the ship does need to be repaired and
this is the best place to do it,'' he said. ``It means jobs for San
Diegans and it is a shot in the arm for a company just recently
purchased by its employees.''
   Like other American shipyards, NASSCO has been struggling to stay
in business in the face of increased foreign competition. Since
1978, 55 U.S. shipyards and repair facilities have closed with a
loss of 60,000 jobs, according to the Shipbuilders Council of
America in Washington, D.C. Just Friday, the last shipyard operating
out of Los Angeles Harbor announced it was closing.
   In April, NASSCO employees purchased the shipyard from Morrison
Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, and the Valdez repair was the first
contract they secured since the ownership change.
   The NASSCO work force has declined from a peak of 8,700 in 1980
to 2,700 today. During the projected nine-month repair, NASSCO is
expanding its work force to 3,000.
   Restoring the tanker to original specifications will require
replacing about 3,000 tons of steel, about 10 percent of its
structure.
   The approximately 42 million gallons of oil that remained in the
987-foot Valdez after the accident was transferred to other tankers.
The ship was then refloated, cleaned and given partial repairs while
Exxon searched for a drydock to rebuild it.
   Exxon initially considered taking the Valdez to Portland, Ore.
   But the Coast Guard and the Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality feared there would be residual oil in the tanker that could
foul the Columbia River at Portland, and drew up a long list of
conditions for Exxon to meet.
   Also, the Coast Guard Capt. James Calhoun in Portland warned in
April that ``radical elements'' might resort to violence if the
tanker went to Portland.
   Carrie Chassin, a spokeswoman for Exxon Shipping Co., said
Exxon's decision to bring the ship to San Diego had nothing to do
with concern over public opposition in Portland.
   ``It was a business decision,'' she said. ``The concern in
Portland originated very early on, before we knew we could get all
the crude off. We were able to totally steam clean the ship and
there is no residual cargo.''
   ``Once we were assured and had knowledge that the ship was not
going to cause an environmental problem, we were pleased to get the
work,'' said Fred Hallett, NASSCO's vice president of finance and
public relations.
   The Valdez lifted anchor June 23, towed by two tugboats. On
Tuesday, San Diego chief harbor pilot Capt. Edward J. Silva Jr. _
who happens to be a member of the militant environmental group
Greenpeace _ will guide the Valdez through San Diego Bay to a NASSCO
dock.
   While the Valdez is off the coast Monday, the Coast Guard will
conduct a final inspection before clearing the ship to enter the
harbor.
   Seven Coast Guard and Harbor Police boats will ring the vessel to
prevent spectators and possible protests from disrupting the ship's
harbor movements.
   Environmental groups have announced they plan demonstrations but
won't organize disruptions.
   ``We don't want to block it because we feel the safest place for
this thing right now is on dry dock,'' said Rick Nadeau, director of
Greenpeace in San Diego.
   Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and several other environmental
groups plan a joint rally in Coronado to coincide with the Valdez's
arrival.
   ``We do want to make a public statement that this ship has become
a symbol of ocean and atmospheric destruction,'' Nadeau said.
   As ``far as we're concerned, it's being repaired so it might go
out and have another accident,'' he said. ``Hopefully, it won't but
it's not impossible.''

<TEXT>
   In the Vendee region, where liberty
and brotherhood were eclipsed by scorched earth and slaughter, talk
of the French Revolution's bicentennial provokes cool, hard stares.
   ``For us, it was a horrible genocide, a lasting source of
national shame,'' said Roger Jouteau, manager of this little town
which is still recovering, in some ways, from a republican assault
in 1794.
   As official France basks in glory, many Frenchmen dispute the
view that their revolution shaped the principle of universal human
rights. Instead, these critics accuse authorities of whitewashing a
black period.
   One such group of dissenters hopes to assemble 500,000 people on
Aug. 15 to pray for forgiveness for revolutionary excesses. They
will gather at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where King Louis
XVI was beheaded.
   Bitterness is especially profound and even personal in the
rolling hills of Vendee, a region of rich farmland south of the
Loire River and extending east from the Atlantic Ocean.
   ``The first human right is the right to truth,'' said Philippe de
Villiers, a member of Parliament from Vendee, in raucous debate on
the popular television program ``Apostrophes.''
   His book, ``Open Letter to the Head Choppers and Liars of the
Bicentennial,'' notes that Vladimir Lenin studied France's
revolution as a model for Russia, and Josef Stalin recalled its
period of bloodletting, known as the Reign of Terror, to justify his
purges.
   The guillotine is famous, de Villiers argues, but few recall the
300,000 Vendeens killed in battle, disemboweled, starved, or shoved
alive into bread ovens in a two-year civil war.
   Most victims were not aristrocrats but peasants who defended the
Roman Catholic clergy and resisted conscription to fight faraway
wars. Children, described as future rebels, were massacred.
   Such new studies as Simon Schama's U.S. bestseller, ``Citizens,''
assert that much of France remained loyal to the king, who initially
agreed to enlightened rule under a constitution.
   Critics say bicentennial celebrations ignore the terror that
followed and later produced Napoleon Bonaparte and finally another
Bourbon king.
   Typical of the Vendee, Les Herbiers is to mark the revolution
July 14 as it always does: with only a brief ceremony ordered by
Paris.
   ``To forget what happened, it is shocking,'' Jouteau said. ``To
spend hundreds of millions of francs that could be used for other
things, shocking.''
   De Villiers hammered away at this theme on television,
criticizing what he estimated as the equivalent of $50 million being
spent on celebrating French glory in the presence of foreign leaders.
   He touched a nerve across the country, but reaction was perhaps
strongest in Vendee.
   Monique Amirda, a patriotic woman, wears a gold necklace in the
shape of the region's emblem: a double heart with a cross and crown
to indicate loyalty to God and king.
   After watching de Villiers, she told a reporter about visiting a
bicentennial display in Paris that listed enemy territories subdued
by the revolution. One was the Vendee.
   ``I was so horrified, I nearly went into shock,'' she said.
   Yves Viollier, who writes historical novels and teaches at La
Roche-sur-Yon, said de Villiers might be too strident, but his point
is indisputable.
   He estimated Vendee's 1789 population at 250,000, of which
150,000 were killed on both sides in the civil war. ``I'm ready to
call it genocide,'' he said.
   Schools suppressed history of the war during the 19th century, he
said, but the region was still regarded with suspicion. In World War
I, he added, Vendeen units were sent straight to the front.
   ``Until I was 11, life here was almost like it was in the 19th
century,'' Viollier. ``It was only in the last 30 years that we
rejoined the world.''

<HEAD>Baker, a Critic of Authoritarian Rulers, Rubs Elbows With Them on
Tour</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA_ ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has welcomed the
global trend away from authoritarian rule, but at least two stops on
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's swing through Asia and
Europe seem immune to such democratic changes.
   Baker has spent much of the past four days in Brunei and Oman,
both sultanates that are virtually devoid of the democratic
trappings normally advocated by the United States.
   In this Arabian Peninsula nation, there are no political parties,
no legislature and no elections. All power rests with Sultan Qaboos,
the latest in a line of monarchs who have ruled this Kansas-sized
land since the 1740s.
   Baker decided to stop off in Oman mainly to rest before joining
President Bush in Poland, the first stop on a four-nation European
tour.
   Oman was chosen in part because few Arab nations, if any, are
friendlier to the United States. Oman was one of the first Arab
nations that endorsed the 1978 Camp David peace agreement between
Egypt and Israel.
   As authoritarian rulers go, Qaboos appears to be more benign than
most. When he deposed his father in 1970, Oman was a land plagued by
poverty, disease and illiteracy.
   In 19 years, Qaboos has been able to forge what is for the most
part a modern, prosperous nation, overcoming such obstacles as a
forbidding climate that often sends temperatures above 130 degrees.
   According to State Department figures, there were only three
schools in Oman in 1970. In 1986, there were 697. The number of
hospital beds rose from 12 to 2,800 in the same time period.
   Oil helped finance the boom, much as it did in Baker's previous
stop, Brunei.
   Unlike Oman, Brunei has a constitution, but it provides Sultan
Hassanal Bolkiah with supreme executive authority.
   The occasion for Baker's visit to Brunei was the annual meeting
of the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   Like Oman, Brunei has a system with a social conscience,
providing subsidized food, fuel, housing, free education and medical
care.
   Brunei's 250,000 citizens enjoy an unusually high standard of
living, which permits them to over look the opulent lifestyle of
their ruler and his two wives.
   The main attraction in Brunei, about the size of Delaware, is the
sultan's palace, a 1,788-room extravaganza with a dining room
capable of accommodating 6,000 for a sit-down meal. Need a bathroom?
The palace has more than 200.
   Amid such abundance, the sultan is somewhat wary about
inquisitive reporters. Before the start of the ASEAN conference,
reporters were told to write about the conference, not about Brunei.
   Still, the sultan has been unable to conceal his role as perhaps
the world's richest man, with an estimated wealth of $28 billion,
almost four times the gross national product of Oman.
   He is one of a handful of men who has claim to a fortune that
dwarfs the estimated $3 billion to $5 billion of Zaire's autocratic
president, Mobutu Sese Seko, the last foreign leader whom Baker
entertained before departing on his tour.

   Being a woman has not made it difficult to govern
Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto says, but it may have caused
some difficulties for her political opponents and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   ``I don't often think of myself as a woman prime minister,'' Ms.
Bhutto said in a televised interview Sunday with David Frost.
   ``I just think of myself as someone who's leading the government,
who's got a job to do, not an easy one, and who would like to have
the prayers of well-wishers everywhere in completing the task in
strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for
the people of Pakistan.''
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, is the first woman in modern times to lead a
Moslem country and is the world's youngest prime minister.
   ``I think it may be a little difficult for my opponents or the
fundamentalists to have a woman prime minister,'' she said.
   ``Of course, it's different being a woman. There's a greater
formality or distance which must be followed so I try to make the
best of it.''
   Ms. Bhutto won power in November in Pakistan's first free
elections in more than a decade. She arrived in Britain on Wednesday
for a week's visit.

   A car dealer plunked down $25,000
for rock star Tina Turner's Mercedes-Benz, but a 1957 Porsche owned
by the late Roy Orbison failed to find a buyer.
   Bidders at Sunday's 13th Annual Newport Beach Collector Car
Auction, one of the nation's largest car auctions, spent $4 million
on 400 cars, the most expensive being a 1965 Ford Shelby 350
prototype that sold for $100,000.
   Miss Turner's 1984 Mercedes-Benz 280 GE wagon, which resembles a
Jeep, was purchased by an import car dealer in Springfield, Ill.,
said auction spokeswoman Christine Main.
   Among the celebrity cars that didn't sell were rock 'n' roll
singer Orbison's Porsche and a vintage Corvette belonging to
``Dynasty'' television star John James.

   Household hints columnist Heloise keeps

recommend that guests try to eat off the kitchen floor.
   The 38-year-old Heloise, whose real name is Ponce Kiah Marchelle

but not a great one.
   The Dallas Morning News interviewed Heloise for its Sunday

   ``If by your definition of good housekeeper _ can you eat off the
kitchen floor and are the baseboards clean and are the windows
shiny? _ then I'm probably not,'' she said.
   But, she added, ``we never run out of toilet paper and paper
towels in this house. There's always enough canned goods in there,
and bread and milk and butter and some fruit, so that no one's going
to starve.''
   Heloise lives with her husband and 14-year-old stepson.
   The columnist works out of her San Antonio home, but travels so

   Six of the world's 10 richest people are
Japanese, but the United States still leads in the number of
billionaires, according to Forbes magazine.
   For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list
of private billionaires, although his wealth shrank during the last
year.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, had a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, down from $18.9 billion last summer.
The fall was attributed mainly to the rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies.
   In its July 24 issue, Forbes said second-ranked Taikichiro Mori,
a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in Tokyo,
had an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion.
   Next was Sam Moore Walton, founder of the third-largest retailer
in the United States, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Walton and his family are
worth an estimated $8.7 billion.
   Others in the top 10 were: the Reichmann brothers, Canada, real
estate, more than $8 billion; Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea, candy, real
estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate, $7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate,
hotels, $7 billion-plus; Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real
estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad Rausing, Sweden, liquids packaging,
$7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land, $6.6 billion.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than $1 billion. They included
55 Americans, 41 Japanese and 20 from West Germany.

   Martina Navratilova lost and laughed.
Steffi Graf won and cried. And about the only thing Boris Becker
fumbled at Wimbledon was the winner's trophy.
   ``I wanted it so badly that I put a little more pressure on
myself than usual,'' the 20-year-old Graf of West Germany said after
overpowering Navratilova in the final set to win her second straight
women's championship 6-2, 6-7, 6-1. ``It's an overwhelming feeling.''
   Also Sunday, Becker blasted passing shots down both lines to
defeat defending champion Stefan Edberg in straight sets in a
rematch of the 1988 final, claiming his third Wimbledon title in
five years.
   The 21-year-old West German, who regained the title he won in
1985 and 1986, defeated Edberg 6-0, 7-6, 6-4 in the most one-sided
final since John McEnroe allowed Jimmy Connors only four games in
1984.
   The championship trophy was the about only thing he couldn't
handle. As he strolled around Centre Court showing off the cup, he
light-heartedly juggled the trophy and fumbled it _ allowing the top
to pop off and onto the grass court.

   It didn't reach the goose that laid the
golden egg. But for 31 years, a man named Jack grew and grew and
grew a philodendron until it could be stretched the length of nearly
four football fields.
   The vine reached his living room ceiling and wound up, down and
around itself. At Christmas time he strung colored lights from it
while it kept on growing until it reached a record 1,114 feet.
   And then, in 1984, Jack Francis chopped it down.
   ``It was a bit of a sentimental moment, because it had been
around so long. I bought it as a little sprout in Sears when we
first moved to Amherst,'' the University of Massachusetts professor
said.
   But sentiment aside, Francis said he was forced to fell his
prized philodendron.
   ``That was the only way we could measure it for the record and,
to tell you the truth, I was getting a bit tired of it,'' he said.
``Chopped into four-foot lengths, it stacked up like cordwood.''
   His children persuaded him to submit it to the Guinness Book of
World Records. And years later, he and his plant are still enjoying
their day in the sun.
   ``I did it as a joke, and no one was more surprised than I when
they accepted it,'' Francis said. ``And if I'd only realized the
sort of attention it would get, I'd at at least have taken a proper
picture of it.''
   But Jack's stalk weighed about 250 pounds and dragging it into a
well-lighted spot seemed overwhelming, so the photo opportunity was
missed.
   Francis' walls are lined with plaques commending him for his
academic achievements in the field of food science and nutrition,
but that acclaim has been shaded by his gardening success.
   ``Despite all this,'' Francis said, gesturing to the citations,
``what I'm known for to everybody ... is growing the world's largest
philodendron.''
   The key to growing the world's largest philodendron _ the
previous mark had been 600 feet _ is patience, Francis said.
   Other than fertilizing every time he watered and winding it back
around itself, Francis took no special steps.
   ``One of the problems I had, though, was repotting it,'' he said.
``They only make pots so big and it had pretty much reached the
maximum and there wasn't much dirt left when we cut it down.''
   But that's the way Jack's garden grows. His late tomato plants
were already a thick, lush 7-foot hedge the first week in July, when
most New England gardeners are nursing along 2- and 3-foot plants.
   He also grows dozens of varieties of vegetables, ranging from the
common zucchini to such southern exotics as passion fruit, kiwi and
chayote.
   His 50-by-70-foot garden got so dense that a few years back, when
he was a semifinalist in the annual gardening contest run by
PBS-TV's ``Victory Garden,'' the cameras couldn't get into the rows.
   ``I don't have the space for them to grow horizontally, so they
have to grow up,'' Francis said. ``This is my latest experiment and
sweet potatoes don't like growing up at all. I have to tuck them
back in the cage every day.''

<HEAD>Indian Inmates Hold First Sweat Lodge Ceremony in Utah Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian inmate pounded a
drum outside a canvas dome, while inside a purification ceremony
capped a two-year legal battle over the religious rite.
   With Saturday's ceremony at the State Prison, Utah became the
19th state to allow Indian sweat lodges on prison grounds.
Corrections officials had resisted the rituals, arguing they posed a
security risk.
   ``This shows you can make anything work as long as you put your
heart in it. We pray for positiveness and unity,'' said Arvol
Looking Horse, Keeper of the Pipe for the Sioux Nation.
   A group of prisoners in 1987 sued to get the sweat lodges, and
U.S. District Court Judge J. Thomas Greene ruled in March that the
prohibition was unreasonable because it meant that ``the Native
American religion was not being accommodated to the extent other
religions are.''
   ``It was fun to win this thing,'' said Danny Quintana, who
represented the inmates in the court battle. ``I was very happy with
the way it turned out.''
   The sweat lodge is a small dome built of willow branch poles
covered with blankets and canvas.
   On Saturday, worshipers entered the sweat lodge, poured water
over a bed of heated rocks and recited prayers.
   Outside the dome, inmates played a water drum and gourd and
chanted and sang as part of the traditional ceremony.
   Nine Indian inmates from the Blackfoot, Shoshone, Sioux and
Navajo tribes participated in the two-hour ceremony.
   ``It's something big for them today. Something they can look
forward to,'' said Robert Eagleman, of the Navajo Nation Corrections
Project.
   Darrell Gardner, a medicine man who built the lodge and will run
the rituals on Saturdays, said the religious experience will have a
definite impact on the practicing inmates.
   ``They're gonna be different people. It changes them and we'll
all benefit from it,'' Gardner said.
   Tribal officials say the sweat lodge is central to purification
and ceremonial rites that date back thousands of years.
   Prison officials claimed the rituals threatened security because
the lodge must be dark and enclosed. Greene's ruling stipulated that
prison guards could dismantle the lodge after each weekly ceremony.
The assembly of the lodge takes only a few hours.

<TEXT>
   One of the last poems written by Gertrude
Stein, the American writer who spent most of her life in France, is
being published for the first time by the American correspondent she
gave it to 45 years ago.
   He is Frank Gervasi, now 81 years old, who has put it in a book
called ``The Violent Decade,'' being published today.
   He said the poem was her way of thanking him for getting her own
book, ``Wars I Have Seen,'' through wartime censorship to her New
York publisher. Stein died in 1946 at the age of 72.
   The poem, called ``A Ballad,'' was written on nine pages of air
mail paper from Air France, the French national airline.
   It begins:
   ``A big bird flying high
   ``In the sky
   ``Makes little birds sitting by
   ``Know they must do or die.''
   The 73 lines tell how the little birds keep hitting the big bird
until it falls into a lake and drowns. It concludes:
   ``And this does happen every day
   ``Just like I say...
   ``For Frank Gervasi
   ``Culoz, September 1, Happy Days, Always,
   ``(signed) Gtd St.''
   Gervasi said he interpreted the poem as an expression of joy in
the imminent triumph of virtue over evil, as World War II came to an
end.
   Stein is famous for the line ``A rose is a rose is a rose.'' Much
of her writing emphasizes repetition and the use of words as much
for their sound as for their meaning.
   Culoz is the little railroad town in southern France where Stein
and her companion, Alice B. Toklas, lived during the German
occupation of France.
   Gervasi wrote that he and Eric Sevareid _ then a radio
correspondent, now a consultant for CBS _ joined in an expedition to
liberate the two women as the Germans pulled back.
   They were a day too late. Stein, Toklas and their poodle, Basket,
had ridden into the nearby town of Belley in a taxi, found it full
of American soldiers, had a big party with them, stayed overnight
and went home.
   Next day Gervasi and Sevareid reached their house, La Colombiere,
got bone-crunching hugs and an invitation to lunch.
   She told him local French officials never let the Germans know
that she was American and Jewish, though German officers were
quartered in her house. He quoted her as saying:
   ``But once I had an Italian major and his aide as guests. The
major remarked on my accent, but if he guessed my identity, he never
gave me away as an American, which goes to show the difference
between the Italians and Germans in more ways than one.''
   Gervasi said she was full of questions about Ernest Hemingway,
``whom she obviously disliked.'' Hemingway had been a frequent
visitor to her Paris apartment and she is credited with having
influenced his style.
   Gervasi lives in New York. He went to work for The Associated
Press there in 1934 and the same year moved to Universal News, which
sent him to Spain to begin his career as a foreign correspondent.
His book covers the five years before World War II in Spain and
Italy, and then follows the war through North Africa to Sicily, the
Italian mainland, Greece and France.

   Newly inaugurated President Carlos
Menem has suggested Argentina and Britain temporarily set aside
their claims to the Falkland Islands, and meet to discuss the
resumption of diplomatic relations.
   ``If Mrs. Thatcher doesn't insist on the issue of sovereignty, we
won't, either,'' Menem told a news conference Sunday. ``Meanwhile,
we could advance in the dialogue toward re-establishing relations.''
   The two countries went to war in 1982 over the windswept,
sparsely populated islands that are 350 miles east of southern
Argentina. Britain won and diplomatic relations were never resumed.
   The government of President Raul Alfonsin, which left office
Saturday, always insisted that sovereignty over the islands claimed
by both countries _ but ruled by Britain since 1833 _ be an issue in
bilateral negotiations.
   Menem's position on the ownership of the islands that Argentines
call the Malvinas is clear: ``We are convinced that the Malvinas are
Argentina's.''

<TEXT>
   Consumers are paying record-high potato prices
and probably won't see much relief until the new fall crop is ready
in a few months, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   Other ``high-value'' farm crops, including fresh produce and some
nuts, are also costing more. Part of the reason stems from last
year's drought, part from rising demand.
   Retail prices of fresh potatoes in May averaged 36.8 cents per
pound nationally, up from 24.7 cents a year earlier.
   Glenn Zepp of the department's Economic Research Service said
that was the highest monthly potato price since at least 1980 and
that probably none before then was as high.
   ``We had a small fall crop last year, and there has also been
strong demand for potatoes for processing,'' Zepp said. ``The real
competition this spring seems to have been between the chippers and
the fresh market. Prices for both really went up.''
   Zepp said in a telephone interview last week and in an
Agricultural Outlook magazine report that the high potato prices
have created optimism among growers.
   ``But this could lead to substantially higher plantings for the
fall crop and sharply lower prices in the next marketing year,'' he
said.
   The farm price of potatoes nationally in May averaged $8.94 per
100 pounds, compared with $4.62 in May 1988. The preliminary price
for June showed some easing to $8.44 per hundredweight.
   According to USDA records, the May and June farm prices of
potatoes were the highest since July 1984 when they averaged $9.72
per hundredweight. In 1981, prices also rose to more than $9 during
a couple of months.
   Zepp said last year's drought hurt the crop severely in the
Midwest, where many of the smaller, round white potatoes are grown
for processing into chips. The North Dakota harvest of fall
potatoes, for example, was less than 14.4 million hundredweight,
down 38 percent from 1987.
   In all, last fall's harvest _ which makes up most of the U.S.
production, with winter, spring and summer varieties accounting for
the remainder _ dropped 10 percent to 307.2 million hundredweight.
Total production was less than 350 million hundredweight, down 9
percent.
   Despite the smaller 1988 crop, processing use of potatoes was
down only 2 percent during the winter and spring. And by May 1, the
nation's inventories of fresh potatoes were down 22 percent from a
year earlier.
   According to Labor Department figures for May _ the June report
will be issued on July 19 _ retail prices for all fresh vegetables
averaged 23 percent more than a year ago. Higher tomato prices also
helped boost the May index.
   ``In addition to specific potato and tomato price pressures, use
of salad bars in restaurants and grocery stores, and growing
consumer awareness of fresh produce's nutritional value are pushing
up vegetable prices,'' Zepp said.
   Based on June 1 estimates for major summer fruits, consumers can
expect reduced supplies of peaches, bartlett pears, nectarines and
plums, while apricot and sweet cherry production will increase.
   Freestone peach output is expected to be down 16 percent from
last year, with all the major growing areas reporting reduced
prospects, Zepp said. Freeze damage during the critical bloom period
in March and April reduced the outlook in Georgia and South Carolina.
   California's clingstone peach production, which is mostly canned,
is expected to be fractionally larger than last year.
   However, Bartlett pear production in California, Oregon and
Washington is forecast down 5 percent. Prices paid to growers are
likely to be higher.
   This year's harvest of tart cherries may drop below the
relatively small 1988 harvest. Drought damaged trees and reduced bud
formation in Michigan, and frosts this spring caused further losses.
Michigan typically produces about 75 percent of the nation's tart
cherries.
   Zepp said that 1989-90 ``should be good for almond growers''
because of higher prices resulting from an expected 24 percent drop
in production to 450 million pounds.
   Walnut sales and shipments have been running below year-earlier
levels, partly because of ample supplies of almonds and pecans.
   ``Market activity is slow for the other tree nuts, also,'' he
said. ``Filbert, pecan and pistachio dealers are waiting for
new-crop production. Macadamia acreage and production continue to
expand.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Administration Considers New Approach to Energy
Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is preparing a new
strategy to win public acceptance of expanded nuclear power, more
oil exploration and other energy goals pursued _ but never attained
_ by past administrations.
   Those who formulated the plan say it will rest on a foundation of
figures compiled by computer to spell out how much energy the nation
will need, where to get it, what it will cost, and how it will
affect the environment.
   ``They've never done that before,'' Henson Moore, deputy energy
secretary, said in an interview. As a result, he said, the
underpinnings of energy policy have been overly vulnerable to public
challenge.
   ``Our credibility is not what it ought to be because we've not
really done this right in the past,'' he said, adding that the
department wants to set a ``credibility standard'' that will be
accepted by energy producers and consumer alike.
   Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
Livermore, Calif., will design the computer programs. A special
panel of the National Academy of Sciences has agreed to review the
results and the final analysis, Moore said.
   ``We will have something that's generally recognized as ... not
being slanted,'' said Moore, a former congressman from Louisiana who
wanted to be President Bush's energy secretary but was persuaded to
take the No. 2 job.
   Moore said details of the new approach will be announced before
the end of July, although the energy policy eventually developed
from the data base likely won't be ready for at least another year.
He said the department probably will hold public hearings this fall
on policy options.
   The department chose Linda Stuntz, 34, an attorney and former
minority staff director of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
to direct the policy development.
   Calls for a new national energy policy have intensified amid
increased public attention to prospects for a renewed oil squeeze
caused by falling U.S. production and rising consumption, and a
possible electricity crisis in the 1990s.
   When he took over as energy secretary in March, James D. Watkins
said he was surprised to see that while past administrations
produced mountains of studies and analyses of the energy problem,
none mapped out a way of solving it.
   Watkins ordered the deartment to develop an ``action plan'' based
on a consistent body of facts about all aspects of the energy
picture, including the environment. Once armed, the department will
stand a better chance of overcoming opposition to nuclear power and
other Bush energy priorities, Moore said.
   ``We're going to have something that people will respect, and
they're going to be hard-pressed to meet us in the streets at high
noon and compare their data with ours and beat us,'' he said.
   Just getting a generally accepted body of facts will be a major
feat.
   ``If we achieve that ... we have achieved a major victory and we
have accomplished the major Bush administration energy initiative of
his first administration,'' Moore said.
   Moore said his department is starting without preconceived
notions about what a national energy policy should entail. But he
and Watkins already have made clear they want to push to revive the
nuclear industry and give oil companies more latitude to explore for
oil and natural gas on federal lands and in promising offshore areas.
   These goals were pursued by the Reagan administration during its
eight years in office, yet nuclear power remains in the doldrums and
Congress has grown more reluctant to permit oil development in
environmentally sensitive areas.
   The oil industry hurt its cause with the Exxon Valdez oil spill
in Alaska last March and a series of less damaging spills on the
East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. Moore said the industry must work
to restore public confidence, but the Energy Department will be in a
position to provide more help than in the past.

<HEAD>Special Elections Will Fill Pepper, Wright, Coelho Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans have high hopes of claiming Claude
Pepper's old House seat in one of three Sunbelt special elections
this summer, but face tougher odds in races to replace Democrats who
left because of ethical problems.
   Republican prospects appear dimmest in Texas, where former
Speaker Jim Wright quit after a GOP-sponsored ethics investigation.
Democrats expect a former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to hold the
seat for them.
   California shapes up as the most competitive of the three races
in a district that regularly elected Democrat Tony Coelho but where
his party owns only a narrow margin in voter registration. Coelho
quit unexpectedly last month rather than face an ethics probe into
his finances.
   The results in the three races will have scant impact on the
balance of power in the House, where Democrats hold a 257-175
majority and have held power for more than three decades.
   But the contests represent the first congressional balloting
since Democrats became ensnared in the ethics difficulties _ and
since Republicans were criticized for a memo that compared Speaker
Thomas Foley's voting record to that of Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, an openly homosexual lawmaker.
   Democrats see a battle for the Florida seat held by Pepper, who
died May 30.
   ``This is going to be a tough seat for us, no question about
that,'' said Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``The demographics have switched
in the years since Claude Pepper and we're going to have a tough
battle on our hands to hold on.''
   Cuban-Americans are now 40 percent of the Miami district's
voters. Wrathful toward the Havana government, they are
overwhelmingly Republican.
   ``The votes are going to go to the one who hates (Fidel) Castro
the most and loves Ollie (North) the most,'' says California-based
lobbyist Arnoldo Torres.
   Two Cuban-Americans _ state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and
millionaire businessman Carlos Perez, a prominent fund-raiser for
North _ are dueling for the GOP nomination in the Aug. 1 primary.
Former North Miami Mayor John Stembridge and insurance broker David
M. Fleischer also are on the GOP ballot.
   Among Democrats, Miami City Commissioner Rosario Kennedy has
strong labor support while Joanne Pepper, the late congressman's
niece, is running a law-and-order, anti-drug campaign that includes
prowling the streets with a police SWAT team.
   Six other Democrats are in the field. But party officials
nationally are glum about the district, and Republicans are taking
care not to appear overconfident.
   Both parties say Democratic chances are better in Coelho's old
California district, which extends through the heavily agricultural
Central Valley, and Wright's bastion around Fort Worth.
   ``We know the Republicans will put up a strong battle in
California, but we're confident that we can hold both seats,''
Democratic spokesman Schloss said.
   In California, a battle is shaping up between conservative state
Rep. Gary Condit, D-Modesto, and former state Food and Agriculture
Director Clare Berryhill, a Republican, in what could turn out to be
a 10-candidate open primary.
   Republican, Democratic and minor party candidates will face off
on the same ballot Sept. 12. Any contender gaining a majority gets a
ticket to Washington. Otherwise, the top Republican and top Democrat
meet in a runoff.
   Berryhill, 64, has strong conservative credentials and another
advantage in the crop-rich valley. ``He is known as a supporter of
the interests of the agricultural community,'' says agricultural
consultant William Lesher.
   With a slight Democratic edge in registration district-wide,
Condit hopes to win the seat outright in September. Berryhill says
his strategy will be to hold Condit to 50 percent or less, and then
face him one-on-one in the November runoff.
   In Texas, Bentsen's backing for 37-year-old attorney Pete Geren
may have discouraged other Democrats.
   Austin political consultant George Christian says the senator's
support represents ``a sort of Good Housekeeping seal of approval''
among Democrats.
   ``I think in a special election where you've got a man who gets
in the race with obvious support and obvious money, then another
fella who wants to get in the race certainly has a big mountain to
climb,'' he said.
   All the candidates clash on one ballot Aug. 12, with a runoff
later in the month between the top two vote-getters, regardless of
party, if no one gets a majority.
   Among Republicans, Dr. Bob Lanier, host of a television health
show, has been boasting of high name recognition.
   Larraine Bethke, a Republican former congressional staffer, is
also running along with Democrat-turned-Republican Jim Hunter, who
lost in an earlier bid for sheriff.

<TEXT>
   The poor women who hoped to end their
pregnancies at Missouri's two public hospitals offering abortions
will be most affected by last week's U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
   The ruling also will mean fewer doctors willing to perform
abortions and fewer counselors willing to give advice to indigents
about the operation, according to abortion rights activists.
   ``Doctors in this state feel the tightening of the screws. It
would take a lot of commitment to women's rights to continue,'' said
Mary Bryant of Planned Parenthood, whose organization already has
difficulty finding doctors willing to perform abortions at its
Columbia clinic.
   ``When Blackmun talks about a chill wind blowing, he has no idea
how chill it is in Missouri,'' Bryant said.
   In his dissenting opinion to July 3's ruling, Justice Harry
Blackmun said that while women still can obtain legal abortions,
``the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
   The court, in a 5-4 vote, upheld Missouri's restrictive abortion
law and invited further challenges to the historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that made abortion a right of women nationwide.
   The Missouri law prohibits abortions from being performed at
public hospitals, bans tax dollars from being spent for
``encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions and requires
doctors to determine, when possible, whether a fetus 20 or more
weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   Anti-abortion groups said the ruling was a step in the right
direction.
   ``Our whole goal has been to chip away at Roe and stop
abortions,'' said Anne Carmichael of Missouri Citizens for Life.
``If we've succeeded at chipping away, that's a good thing.''
   State Attorney General William Webster, who argued in favor of
the law, and abortion rights advocates, who opposed it, agreed the
decision would not immediately limit the availability of abortions
in Missouri in a dramatic way.
   Of the 17,382 procedures in Missouri last year, only 90 were
performed at public hospitals.
   Bryant and others say the ruling will slowly and subtly curtail
the procedure, especially for poor women in Missouri.
   Only two Missouri public hospitals performed abortions, in most
cases for needy women who suffered from other medical problems that
made their abortions risky, said Carroll Metzger, a former nursing
administrator at one of the hospitals, Truman Medical Center West in
Kansas City.
   Metzger, who now works elsewhere in the Kansas City area, was one
of the original plaintiffs in the lawsuit that challenged the
Missouri law, which was passed in 1986 but did not go into effect
until the high court decision.
   ``The reality that no one talks about is that women who are very
poor can't afford abortions in Missouri anyway. Now we're limiting
it even further,'' Metzger said. Missouri cut off public funding for
abortions in 1980.
   Abortions are available in Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield
and Columbia. Women in remote, rural areas such as the southeastern
Bootheel region often must make long trips to the city to get
abortions or inexpensive medical attention of any kind.
   Metzger and Bryant said doctors and counselors who serve
low-income women will be unlikely even to broach the subject of
abortion for fear they will be sued, although it would still be
legal to tell a pregnant woman what her options are.
   ``Public doctors and nurses would be crazy to talk about it. The
chilling effect is going to be devastating,'' said Bryant.
   Diane Booth, executive director of Planned Parenthood's clinic in
Columbia, said it's been difficult for several years to find doctors
willing to perform abortions. A Kansas City doctor travels 125 miles
to perform abortions at the clinic.
   ``Given the size of Columbia's medical community, that's quite an
indictment,'' Booth said. Columbia, a city of about 60,000
residents, has three hospitals, including the University of
Missouri-Columbia Hospital and Clinics, the other public hospital
where abortions were performed before last week.

<HEAD>Comic Book Hero Zen is `No Wimpy Alien'</HEAD>

   As the creator of the comic book ``Zen,
Intergalactic Ninja'' sees it, most of today's space aliens are
either bad guys or wimps.
   Enter Zen, a short, muscular, blue-skinned space warrior; a
no-nonsense sort of extraterrestrial.
   ``Sort of the Dirty Harry of aliens,'' said his creator, Steve
Stern.
   Rather than spattering small-time villains with a big revolver
like the Clint Eastwood film character, however, Zen addresses the
big questions.
   His latest mission is to save Earth from ecological destruction
at the hands of a planet-devouring madman named Notan the
Magnificent. Zen works through his mental link with Jeremy, the
offspring of an alien queen and a mortal human.
   Stern and airbrush artist Dan Cote publish the bimonthly comic as
a sideline from their jobs. Stern heads a small advertising
business; Cote is a commercial artist in Lewiston.
   Until now, writers and film producers have treated most space
aliens as evil, said Stern, citing a tradition that extends from the
H.G. Wells novel, ``War of the Worlds'' to the hit movie, ``Alien.''
   The exceptions, he said, are creatures like E.T., whom he
characterized as wimpy and ineffectual, and Alf, the fuzzy but
obnoxious star of a children's TV show.
   ``The comic book-buying public responded to Zen because he
represents a true alien hero,'' Stern said. In recent years, ``there
have been very few, if any, alien heroes who come to mind.''
   The earlier generation of otherwordly superheros, such as
Superman, don't count, because they looked like earthlings rather
than aliens, Stern said.
   To underscore his scorn for nerds from outer space, Stern has
printed hundreds of stickers that show an E.T.-like character in a
red circle with a slash through it, with the phrase, ``No Wimpy
Aliens.''
   Stern said he used Zen because he believes the branch of Buddhism
offers a valuable guide to day-to-day living. Zen imparts that
philosophy to Jeremy, who develops confidence and assurance as the
story unfolds.
   Cote draws the comic book with a painstakingly slow airbrush
technique that gives it a realistic, three-dimensional look. It is
produced in black and white with a multi-color cover.
   From an initial printing of 4,000 copies for the first issue in
November 1987, circulation has climbed to 20,000, Stern said. He
hopes soon to get a break that would turn Zen into a national
phenomenon.
   ``The explosion of comic books into the mass media is at a fever
pitch right now,'' he said, citing box office records set by the
movie ``Batman.''
   Stern also sees as a promising sign a heightened awareness of
environmental problems.
   Organizers of Earth Day 1990 have contacted Stern about a
possible role for Zen in that observance. Stern and Cote also have
established the Zen Save the Earth Foundation, which will divert a
portion of the profits from licensing agreements to organizations
dedicated to environmental protection.
   Zen's creator hopes to follow in the path of ``Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles,'' an independently produced comic that became a major
success, spawning a popular animated television series and sets of
toy action figures.
   A line of Zen pencils and notebooks is already on the market;
Stern hopes a latex mask of Zen can be in stores by Halloween 1990.
   As a boy growing up on New York's Long Island, Stern eagerly
awaited each new issue of ``Batman,'' ``Superman'' and the ``The
Fantastic Four.''
   Following graduation from the University of Miami as an English
major, he returned to New York to write horror and science fiction
comics. The pay was low, and he drifted into advertising to make
ends meet.
   Stern thought up Zen in 1970, but stashed a one-page synopsis in
a suitcase. Four years ago, after moving to Auburn, 30 miles north
of Portland, with his wife, he met Cote.
   A couple of days earlier, Stern had opened his old suitcase and
the sheet of paper with the idea for Zen flew out. He felt it was an
omen and moved ahead with the project.

   A riot erupted in a prison late Sunday,
with a barracks engulfed in flames and as many as 12 people injured,
a fire dispatcher said.
   The riot broke out at 10 p.m. at the Banning Road Camp
Rehabilitation Center, and one barrack was destroyed by fire, said
Bonnie Underwood, a Riverside County Fire Department dispatcher.
   Fire Department paramedics had not been able to confirm the exact
number of injuries because they were not immediately allowed inside
the minimum- and maxmimum-security camp, which holds between 300 and
400 inmates, said Underwood.
   She said no deaths were reported.
   Tim Lewis, who lives across the street from the center, said that
at about 10:15 p.m. he heard a ``large explosion, like a sonic
blast.''
   ``The whole place is in flames,'' he said. ``There are flames
leaping up 50, 60, 70 feet high. And there must be 150 squad cars,
police, fire trucks, paramedics.''
   About 15 minutes later, a power pole exploded and plunged the
camp into darkness.
   ``I'm looking out my kitchen door and I see black clouds, fire
billowing very high, police running around in riot gear,'' Lewis
said. ``I sure hope I don't lose my house. Sparks and embers are
flying everywhere.''
   Debbie Gates, a dispatcher for the county sheriff's department,
said hundreds of deputies and police surrounded the prison late
Sunday.
   ``All of our available on-duty personnel is out there,'' said
Gates.
   Banning is 90 miles east of Los Angeles.

   Insurance companies won't be able to cover the
cost of a major natural disaster, such as an earthquake, if one
occurs around the year 2000, according to a new actuarial study.
   Either a hike in insurance premiums or increased taxes will be
needed to compensate future disaster victims, said the report
entitled ``Forecast 2000.''
   The report was released in Washington in advance of today's
meeting in Toronto of actuaries from throughout North America.
   Actuaries use economic and statistical methods to evaluate the
financial implications of future events. They are widely employed by
insurance companies.
   The survey of 332 actuaries found that 81 percent believe that
insurance companies will not be able to cover the costs of a major
natural disaster, such as an earthquake, in the year 2000.
   About 90 percent of those surveyed concluded that federal
programs such as the so-called Superfund will be inadequate to cover
the costs of cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites in the year
2000. Most thought extra taxes will be needed.
   Such costs will have to be borne by federal, state and provincial
governments, according to 55 percent of the actuaries. Some 24
percent said consumers will be stuck with this cost, and only 11
percent said the insurance companies will have to pay. The rest said
the money would come from other sources.
   The survey covered 332 actuaries and was compiled by the American
Academy of Actuaries, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Casualty
Actuarial Society, Conference of Actuaries in Public Practice and
the Society of Actuaries.

<HEAD>Illinois Clinic Becoming a Focal Point for Abortion Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's next legal battle over
abortion rights may center on a clinic in what looks like a peaceful
setting _ an old yellow-brick schoolhouse often used for bingo
parties.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review whether the clinic,
one of six tenants in the building, can operate without obeying
elaborate state requirements for non-hospital surgical centers.
   The clinic's owner, Dr. Richard Ragsdale, said the requirements
are medically unnecessary and designed to discourage abortion
providers by forcing them to build ``the equivalent of a small
hospital,'' an expensive proposition.
   The rules, in effect, make abortions harder to obtain, Ragsdale
contends.
   A federal judge agreed, and put the rules on hold. The 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals also agreed, but the state appealed, saying
the rules are needed to protect women's health.
   The case is one of three abortion-related lawsuits the high court
will consider in its fall session, which is expected to set a
judicial course that could alter or revoke the right to have an
abortion.
   The other cases _ from Minnesota and Ohio _ concern only
teen-agers, who represent about one-third of patients getting
abortions yearly.
   The Illinois case affects all women seeking abortions during
their first trimester or early second trimester of pregnancy _ more
than 90 percent of all patients, said Colleen Connell, the American
Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ragsdale.
   In addition, the justices may find it difficult to revive the
Illinois laws without substantially dismantling the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized abortion, observers said.
   Demonstrators from both sides picketed at Ragsdale's Northern
Illinois Women's Center on Thursday and Friday.
   Anti-abortionists buoyed by the July 3 high court ruling that
upheld restrictions by Missouri slowed traffic Friday. No arrests
were reported.
   ``We think things are moving toward pro-life. I just think Dr.
Ragsdale's days are numbered here,'' said activist Denise Franzen,
34, of nearby Rockton.
   But Tracy Winkler, a counselor at Ragsdale's clinic and one of
several staffers who held ``Keep Abortion Legal'' signs in front of
the center, said the decision may wake up those who favor women's
right to have an abortion.
   ``The Supreme Court decision may be the kick in the butt to get
the pro-choice people to do something,'' she said. ``Too many
pro-choicers have been too silent too long, and this is the result.''
   The clinic has come under numerous attacks since Ragsdale moved
his practice to there four years ago, after a hospital affiliate
refused to renew his lease because of the high cost of making the
building improvements required by the state for abortion clinics.
   At least 180 people have been arrested for trespassing, seven
people have been arrested for battery and five fires have been set,
said the building's owner Wayne Webster. A suspect in at least two
of the arson fires has been convicted and jailed.
   It's hard to picture a less likely site for such a battle.
   The two-story, limestone-and-brick structure is in a modest
commercial district. Inside, three tenants are organizations that
hold bingo parties in a downstairs hall where wooden floors creak
and chalk boards line the walls.
   Upstairs, Ragsdale's clinic occupies one-tenth of the building
and has a 10-year lease. The renovated, 4,000-square-foot complex
has a sophisticated security system with audio and visual monitors
to keep track of protesters outside.
   The clinic is open three mornings a week, and says it serves 12
to 30 patients daily, almost all of whom receive abortions.
   Eighty-five percent are referred by other physicians or by
women's health-care centers, said Ragsdale, who testified in 1985
that he had probably performed 42,000 abortions in the previous 12
years.
   Ragsdale said he doesn't know whether he will close the clinic if
he loses the case.
   He said he doesn't have the money to make the required
modifications, and no banker would lend it to him, given past
violence against abortion clinics around the country and the
possibility the procedure will be outlawed.

   Raising taxes by $5.3 billion and putting the
final touches on President Bush's $157 billion bailout of the
savings and loan industry dominate the focus of lawmakers returning
from a long July Fourth holiday.
   Before recessing again in four weeks for its annual month-long
August vacation, Congress also must look at raising the $2.8
trillion statutory ceiling on the federal debt.
   But first, the House likely will vote this week on an
administration-opposed moratorium on new offshore oil leasing in the
wake of the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in March off the Alaska coast.
   The White House and congressional Democrats also face the
likelihood of another bruising fight over the transfer of U.S.
aircraft technology to Japan for the FSX jet fighter.
   Bush has threatened to veto a resolution passed by Congress last
month approving the FSX deal but placing restrictions on
negotiations for further stages in the joint project.
   Opponents, led by organized labor, fear that Japan may use the
technology to develop a commercial aerospace industry to compete
with U.S. plane makers. They claim to have increasing support among
lawmakers, making an override of the anticipated veto possible.
   The biggest tasks for lawmakers over the next month are the S&amp;L
bailout and coming up with $5.3 billion in additional federal
revenue _ a euphemism for tax increase _ next year as part of a
deficit-reduction deal cut between Bush and congressional leaders in
April.
   The S&amp;L rescue is likely to be the easiest. Lawmakers hope to
complete within two weeks a compromise package acceptable to the
Senate and House as well as the administration.
   Senate negotiators are expected to yield to
administration-endorsed provisions in a House-passed bill that would
make S&amp;L owners put up billions of dollars more of their own money
as a buffer between risky loans and the government's deposit
insurance fund.
   The fund now has an estimated $35 billion to $55 billion deficit
that is growing by $30 million a day because of overly risky and
often fraudulent loans that S&amp;L operators made using federally
insured deposits.
   Congress and the administration acknowledge that taxpayers are
going to have to cover most of the losses, but they disagree on the
mechanics of how to spread the burden over the next three decades
rather than force a tax increase now.
   The House bill does it by borrowing the money over the next three
years directly through the Treasury Department, swelling the deficit
for each year but exempting the costs from deficit reduction targets
now in the law.
   Bush and the Senate would raise the bailout's costs through
private 30-year bonds that avoid swelling the annual deficits but
carry an extra interest charge to taxpayers of at least $4.5 billion.
   At one time, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had vowed to
recommend that Bush veto any S&amp;L legislation that raises the deficit
significantly. Brady, however, has not repeated the threat in recent
weeks.
   The tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee will begin work
this week on raising revenues by $5.3 billion next year without
violating an understanding with the administration over what would
constitute a violation of Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge
last year.
   Among the measures under consideration are a proposal by the
panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., to repeal the 50
percent exclusion on interest income for employee stock ownership
plans.
   Also on the revenue-enhancing chopping block are some $300
million in tax breaks for banks that forgive Third World loans and
$250 million in tax breaks for acquirers of ailing S&amp;Ls.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined
slightly.
   The dollar closed at 139.28 yen, down 0.37 yen from Friday's
139.65-yen finish. It opened at 139.25 yen and ranged between 139.00
yen and 139.35 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 27.95
points, or 0.08 percent, ending the day at 33,676.02. It shed 74.96
points during the morning session.
   Dealers said the index fell as a result of selling by foreign
investors in arbitrage deals to buy cheaper futures issues.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said Japanese
investors were reluctant to buy issues mainly because of concerns
over the election for the upper house of the parliament, scheduled
for July 23.
   Analysts predict the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
will lose badly in the election, hurt by the Recruit
influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular sales tax imposed in April
and reports that Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has kept several paid
mistresses, Umemori said.
   ``On top of it, the agriculture minister's remarks degrading
women last Friday triggered investors' worries that it might have
further damaged LDP popularty,'' he said.
   In a speech on behalf of LDP candidates, Agriculture Minisater
Hisao Horinouchi said ``women are useless in the world of politics.''
   ``Although macro-economic factors, including lower interest rates
in the United States, seem good for stock investment, the problem
here is the election,'' Umemori added.
   In currency dealing, trading was quiet ahead of release of
several U.S. economic indicators this week, including the producer
price index Friday.
   But the dollar is likely to become more bullish as the yen comes
under stronger pressure out of fear the LDP is losing its grip on
Japanese politics, said a dealer with a commercial bank in Tokyo.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar's ``direction is
unclear'' following the market's reaction Friday to a report that
the U.S. jobless rate edged up to 5.3 percent in June from May's 5.2
percent.
   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most
investors were awaiting the U.S. wholesale price index for May, to
be released Friday.

<HEAD>Viability is Concern in Only Small Percentage of Abortions, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only about 1 percent of all abortions in the
United States are performed after the 20th week of pregnancy, the
stage where questions of fetal viability could be raised, statistics
show.
   A prominent part of the Supreme Court's abortion ruling last
week, such late-term abortions heighten the question of when a fetus
could live outside the womb.
   Based on Centers of Disease Control statistics for 1985, the last
year complete numbers are available, only about 13,280 abortions in
the United States were performed after the 20th week of pregnancy.
   The vast majority of abortions, about 90 percent, are performed
by the 15th week, long before viability of the fetus is a biological
possibility.
   According to studies by CDC and others, about 73 percent of the
relative handful who seek late-term abortions are under age 24. A
majority of them are in their teens. Most are unmarried.
   One survey showed such women often are reluctant to tell parents
or boyfriends of their pregnancy, and many have problems arranging
abortions because of money or transportation. Some didn't realize
they were pregnant in the early weeks. And a major concern for about
third of those seeking late abortions is concealing the fact they
are sexually active.
   Although the numbers are small when compared to all abortions
performed, the late-term cases create a nightmare for doctors who
must deal with the uncertainty of fetal age.
   The issue inflames emotions among anti-abortion groups who
believe infants capable of sustaining life are being killed.
   And it is an issue that attracted a major share of attention in
the Supreme Court's ruling last week that gave states power to
impose new restrictions on the right to have an abortion.
   CDC statistics show that 3.6 percent of those seeking abortions
after the 20th week of pregnancy are under the age of 15. The
largest number, 36.7 percent, are between 15 and 19 years of age,
and 32.8 percent are aged 20 to 24.
   Abortions after the 20th week among women aged 25-30 account for
13 percent and those over age 30 only 11.9 percent. The age of the
woman was not given in 2 percent of the late-term cases. Late
abortions frequently are chosen by the over-30 age group if tests
show the fetus has a defect such as Down's Syndrome.
   In the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling last week, the court upheld the
right of Missouri to require doctors to perform pre-abortion tests
on any fetus that could be 20 or more weeks old.
   The tests are designed to determine whether the fetus is
``viable,'' that is, able to live outside the mother's womb.
   Viability is directly related to fetal age. Currently, premature
infants less than 23{ weeks old have virtually no chance of survival
outside the womb. And of infants born at 24 weeks, only one in 10
lives, despite increasingly sophisticated efforts by experts at
leading centers.
   But the court accepted the position by the state of Missouri that
the best tests for fetal age are only accurate to within about four
weeks. To protect any possibly viable fetus, the state required the
tests to be performed at 20 weeks. And the majority of the Supreme
Court accepted this reasoning.
   Most doctors expert in the field, however, said fetal age can be
pinpointed within an error range of only 10 days through the use of
sonography, an instrument to makes a picture of the fetus using
ultra-high frequency sound waves.
   Ultrasound pictures enable doctors to take measurements of the
skull and of the long bones in the body of the fetus, which develop
at a known rate. These measurements then are converted to an age
estimate.

   Most Americans oppose the U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that allowed states to restrict abortions, and say they do
not believe Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, according to a Time
magazine-CNN poll.
   In the poll released Sunday, 61 percent said they disagreed with
the July 3 ruling on a Missouri abortion law, and 57 percent said
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortions, should be
overturned.
   Thirty-two percent said they would never vote for a candidate who
advocates restricting the right to an abortion, compared with 24
percent who said they would never support an office-seeker who
favors abortion.
   In a poll released Saturday by Newsweek magazine, 53 percent
disapproved last week's Supreme Court ruling and 37 percent approved.
   The Time poll found 31 percent favor new state laws restricting
access to abortions, while 57 percent oppose such limitations. But
52 percent in Newsweek's poll said they believed their states would
pass new laws.
   The Time-CNN poll was conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman on
Thursday. A total of 504 adults were interviewed by telephone. The
margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
   For the Newsweek poll, the Gallup Organization interviewed 751
adults by telephone on Thursday and Friday. The margin of error is
plus or minus 4 points.

<HEAD>Government Jails Nearly 2,000 For Union Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 2,000 teachers were jailed for
defying the government and holding labor rallies, and President Roh
Tae-woo said today that it is wrong for educators to form unions.
   The outlawed National Teachers' Union said its members would
resign en masse to protest the government crackdown on Sunday's
union rallies.
   About 12,000 riot police had sealed off downtown Sungkyunkwan
University campus to block a rally of the union by teachers, family
members and students.
   Several thousand protesters regrouped in front of the National
Assembly and several hundred more staged rallies in central Seoul,
shouting anti-government slogans and clashing with police in side
streets and alleys.
   At least 20 teachers were injured in the protests, witnesses said.
   Police said 1,931 people were arrested and 940 were released.
Police said many of those jailed would not speak or give their
names, delaying the release of others.
   The government said names of teachers taking part in protests
would be sent to education authorities for discipline. About 130
teachers have been disciplined or dismissed so far this year.
   ``It is unreasonable for teachers to seek unionization,'' Roh
said in a nationwide radio address today.
   ``Should education become another arena for struggle, damage will
be inflicted on the next generation,'' Roh said. ``This will darken
our future.''
   The National Teachers' Union claims membership of 20,000 and is
campaigning for better salaries and working conditions and
elimination of bureaucracy, which the union claims hinders needed
reform.
   The government maintains the union violates the national
employees law that bans unionizing by government workers and
teachers. Education authorities claim some teachers are using the
union to spread leftist and revolutionary ideas.
   There are about 300,000 primary and secondary school teachers in
South Korea. The average salary is about $550 dollars a month.
   The formation May 28 of the teachers' union was among the latest
attempts by workers to gain a larger slice of the economic pie as
South Koreans throw off the yoke of authoritarian rule.

<HEAD>China Announces Corruption Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist Party, seeking to improve an
image tarnished by its harsh suppression of dissent, today said it
has expelled hundreds of its members for corruption.
   The People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the 47.7
million-member party, said 452 officials in the southern province of
Guizhou were expelled for corruption during the first half of 1989.
   On Sunday, it was reported that one local party leader in Guizhou
was given the death sentence for selling counterfeit liquor.
   The official press recently has highlighted crackdowns on
corruption as part of the drive to improve its image following its
violent June 4 crackdown on the student-led movement for democratic
reform.
   The students won wide support among the general populace during
their seven-week campaign of class boycotts, marches and sit-ins by
demanding action to end rampant corruption among Chinese officials.
   Protesters frequently referred to how leaders use their influence
to obtain good jobs and trips abroad for their children. Among those
criticized was senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whose son Deng Pufang
formerly had connections with a company singled out for involvement
in speculation and profiteering.
   The People's Daily said today that instances of party members
involved in bribe-taking and graft in Guizhou were up 25 percent
from the first half of 1988, and that top priority should be given
to investigating the behavior of party members.
   It also reported that Wang Yuntian, vice chairman of the
commodity prices committee in the western province of Gansu, was
expelled from the party for making $170,000 by profiteering in sugar.
   The front-page article said another Gansu official was tricked
out of $81,000 during an unauthorized trip to Hong Kong. One
official used public funds to buy a private home and another sold
state-supplied medicine and used the money to hold an elaborate
funeral for his wife.
   Another man, chairman of a commerce and industry bureau in a
southern China city, was drummed out of the party for trying to
impede an investigation into a local cigarette trafficking case, the
daily reported.
   The paper, in a lengthy front-page commentary, acknowledged that
the recent pro-democracy unrest garnered wide public support
``because some party members, cadres and especially a minority of
leaders were engaged in corrupt practices which made the people very
dissatisfied.
   ``Of course the organizers of the rebellion used anti-corruption
slogans to incite the uncertain public. The party will continue its
fight against corruption,'' it said.
   The commentary promised that those found guilty ``will be
punished irrespective of who they are, for if we don't fight
corruption, then our party will be separated from the people and
this may lead to chaos.''
   The ``rebellion'' refers to the pro-democracy movement that was
crushed June 4 when soldiers ran student protesters out of central
Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians. Hundreds more have
since been arrested.
   The movement also triggered a power struggle within the party,
ending with the purging of party chief Zhao Ziyang for showing
sympathy to some of the student demands.
   The People's Daily commentary stressed that students who took
part in demonstrations will be given greater ideological education
but will not be punished, while those who led the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion will not be forgiven.''
   It urged all Chinese to make extra efforts to carry out four
major tasks set forth by at a meeting last month of the party's
governing Central Committee, with top priority given to the
``quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The other tasks are promoting the economic open-door policy,
enhancing ideological work and strengthening the party.
   It said young people who lack understanding of the West ``easily
accept capitalist propaganda'' and should be educated to resist
``bourgeois liberalization,'' the attraction to Western culture.
   ``This is very important to the future of our country.''

   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today,
and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also inched down.
   The dollar closed at 139.28 yen, down 0.37 yen from Friday's
139.65-yen close. It opened at 139.25 yen and moved narrowly between
139.00 yen and 139.35 yen.
   Kimio Kobori, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, said that most
market players ``remained on the sidelines, being unable to
determine whether they should sell or buy.
   ``In the absence of fresh market-affecting news, Japanese
investors already have turned their concern to the U.S. wholesale
price index this coming Friday,'' he added.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 27.95 points, or 0.08 percent, ending the day at
33,676.02. It shed 74.96 points during the morning session.
   Yutaka Yoshino, a dealer with Nikko Securities, attributed the
Nikkei's fall to technical adjustments after gains for three
consecutive trading days last week.
   ``Some market analysts say the market is not doing well due to
investors' concerns over the elections, but that is no longer a
fresh market-affecting incentive, although some concern remains,''
he said.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said Japanese
investors were reluctant to buy shares, mainly because of
uncertainty over elections on July 23 for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house.
   Analysts predict the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will suffer
major losses because of the Recruit influence-peddling scandal, an
unpopular sales tax imposed in April, and reports that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno has kept paid mistresses.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500
million shares. Shipbuilding, electrical and chemical shares were
all lower, while some oil issues sold well.

<HEAD>Serial Murder Probe Enters Second Year With no Clear Leads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skeletons of nine women began showing up a year
ago along southeastern Massachusetts highways, but no charges have
been brought and authorities are frustrated by false leads in the
serial killings.
   ``It's not getting any easier,'' said James Martin, a spokesman
for the district attorney. ``Time is going on and the trail's
getting colder.''
   The nine women, as well as two others missing and believed dead,
were drug addicts and many supported their habit through
prostitution in the New Bedford area.
   But aside from the similar backgrounds, few links have been made
in the slayings. Since last July, the bodies have turned up
one-by-one, uncovered by highways workers, passersby and police dogs
sniffing 40 miles of roads.
   ``We started with a lukewarm trail to begin with because the
bodies were decomposed and little evidence was left at the scene,''
Martin said.
   Authorities have been tight-lipped about their investigation.
   Troopers have worked 3,500-plus overtime hours, a forensic
specialist was brought from Washington, D.C., and a special grand
jury was convened several times last spring to hear testimony.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina also has
recruited the FBI's special serial-murder investigation unit, which
has been working up a profile of a killer.
   But still, no arrests.
   James A. Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern
University, said leads were particularly hard to find because the
killer had obscured clues to the scene of the crime.
   ``This is the kind of serial murder where the victims' bodies are
dumped some other place than where they were killed, cutting out a
major form of police investigation: the forensics evidence,'' Fox
said.
   He said serial killers also were difficult to trace because they
generally prey on strangers. ``There's no clear motive,'' said Fox,
co-author of ``Mass Murder: America's Growing Menace.''
   Martin said the investigation has also been hindered by a ``hall
of mirrors.''
   Investigators spend much time at Weld Square, New Bedford's
rundown redlight district. They take to the streets after dark and
by dawn have often questioned scores of prostitutes and drug dealers.
   But the stories told by street people often are contradictory and
frequently fabricated under the influence of alcohol, cocaine or
heroin.
   ``We're in a situation right now where we're frustrated because a
couple of weeks ago the DA received information from a witness that,
if corroborated, could very quickly lead to an indictment,'' Martin
said last week.
   ``We've been out searching for that information and evidence over
the last couple of weeks and haven't found it.''
   Martin declined to give details on the lead, but said the tip now
seems to have fizzled. This is not an unfamiliar pattern.
   Through the last nine months four suspects have emerged. Although
the district attorney has never named names, the men all have been
questioned and their links to the Weld Square community detailed
extensively in media reports.
   Two men were held on unrelated assault charges; a third appeared
before a special grand jury; and Pina has said he'd like to question
the fourth, a lawyer who moved to Florida last fall.
   But Fox was skeptical. ``If any of these people were the killer,
my guess is that he'd be arrested already,'' he said.
   Fox also said the odds for finding the killer or killers weren't
improving.
   ``The longer it takes, the less likely there is to be an
arrest,'' Fox said.

<TEXT>
   A suspended black priest who defied church
authorities for the second week by conducting his own brand of
services incorporating African religious rites says he will try to
reconcile with the Roman Catholic Church.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., who accuses the church of
racism and failing its black parishioners, told a local television
station Sunday that he planned to begin seeking reconciliation by
the end of the week ``so that we are not separated and divided, but
we are all working toward the same goal.''
   Stallings declined to discuss terms of a proposed reconciliation,
but told WRC-TV, ``I think that this could happen within the next 30
days.''
   The Rev. William Lori, personal secretary to Washington
Archbishop Cardinal James A. Hickey, said the church would welcome
reconciliation.
   ``Our hope and our prayer through all of this is
reconciliation,'' Lori said. ``Obviously, we'll have to see what the
proposal contains. But remember that the cardinal has always left
the door open.''
   A woman who plans to join Stallings' new African-American
Catholic Congregation said the Catholic church must find a way to
address the needs of its black parishioners.
   ``I feel the Catholic Church is going to have to confront this
issue in some way and now is as good a time as any,'' said Christine
Kearney, a former worshipper at the Catholic parish led until
recently by Stallings. She said she plans to join his new Imani
Temple.
   ``I don't want to leave the Roman Catholic Church, but I do want
some input into the way I worship. That's all he is trying to do,''
Kearney said.
   Stallings led services Sunday, shouting above the din of African
drums, exhorting a packed auditorium to spread the word about the
new Catholic congregation that blends African religious rites,
gospel music and traditional Catholic liturgy.
   The swaying, clapping congregation shouted back as the choir
swung into ``Praise Him,'' a rollicking favorite in many black
churches.
   Stallings's back-to-back revival-style services at Imani Temple
marked the second straight week he has said mass in defiance of
church authorities.
   ``We are not simply making a joyful noise, we are not just
talking about our African-American cultural and spiritual heritage,
we are helping you to know the Lord in a way you have never known
him before,'' Stallings told parishioners.
   ``We've got to tell people about it ... There's plenty of lapsed
Catholics, plenty of what I call pagan Catholics you only see on
Christmas,'' Stallings said.
   Stallings said mass and served communion to more than 2,000
parishioners in the Suitland High School auditorium in suburban
Washington, summer home of the new church. He also asked for
donations to build a new church.
   The 41-year-old priest wore a robe trimmed with African printed
fabric and called on worshipers to ``invoke the spirits'' of African
and black American ancestors.
   He poured libations made of earth taken from the grounds of six
black institutions in Philadelphia, including a prominent black
Catholic parish.
   The service was a repeat of an inaugural service last Sunday that
drew an estimated 3,000 people to a larger church _ and which
resulted in Stallings' suspension by the Roman Catholic archdiocese
of Washington.
   Stallings spokesman Paul Dillard said more than 400 people agreed
to join the church Sunday.
   In New York, worshippers of Our Lady of Charity Church in
Brooklyn held their own mass rich in black cultural expression to
show support for Stallings, according to today's editions of the New
York Times. Members of the congregation, facing an altar that
featured the figure of a black Jesus, spent most of the service on
their feet, swaying and clapping to Gospel melodies.
   ``What we did today wasn't all that different from what Father
Stallings did last Sunday,'' said parishioner Jaime Cobham. ``We
just want to worship in our own idiom. You'll find he has a lot of
support here.''
   Stallings has said he wants to see formation of an
African-American Catholic rite that would still recognize the
authority of the pope but give individual priests more control over
Catholic liturgy and other matters.
   Stallings' suspension means he is not sanctioned by the church to
lead mass or perform sacraments. It is the strongest step Hickey can
take without moving for excommunication.
   ``He is a suspended priest ... The church is not going to stand
behind anything he does sacramentally,'' Hickey's assistant Lori
said in an interview Saturday. Lori said the church is not
contemplating any further discipline for now.
   Several churchgoers said they attended Stallings' parish during
the 12 years Stallings was pastor of a predominantly black parish in
Washington.
   One woman, who declined to give her name, said she isn't sure
she'll join. ``I just don't know at this point. I'll know when the
spirit moves me,'' she said.
   But she and Kearney said they will not stop attending church if
Stallings is excommunicated.
   ``Those who are following out of curiosity will probably go
someplace else,'' Kearney said. ``Those who are true believers will
continue.''

   A mild earthquake centered just northeast
of San Jose shook the southern San Francisco Bay area.
   There were no reports of damage, according to the Santa Clara
County Communications Center.
   The earthquake, which hit just after 6:30 a.m. Sunday, measured
3.9 on the Richter scale and was centered in the Alum Rock area
seven miles northeast of San Jose, according to the Seismographic
Stations of the University of California at Berkeley.
   The tremor was centered on the Calaveras Fault, roughly in the
area as the June 12, 1988, earthquake that had a magnitude of 5.5.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage.

<NOTE>GEOGRAPHY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Located in Central Europe, the 120,727-square-mile Soviet bloc
country is bordered by the Baltic Sea to the north, the Soviet Union
to the east, Czechoslovakia to the south and East Germany to the
West. Its largest cities are Warsaw, the capital, with a population
of 1.67 million; Lodz, population 845,000; Krakow, population
744,000. Gdansk has 467,000 residents.

   Poland's 38 million people are 94 percent Roman Catholic. The
life expectancy for males is 66.8 years, for females 75.2 years. The
literacy rate is 98 percent. Thirty-nine percent of the people live
in the country, 61 percent in the city.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HISTORY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Poland was a great power controlling large sections of central
Europe from the 14th to the 17th centuries. Three partitions from
1772 to 1795 divided the country among Prussia, Russia and Austria.
   The post-World War I Treaty of Versailles recognized Poland's
independence in 1919. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded
Poland in 1939. The Communists consolidated power in fraud-tainted
1947 elections.
   Amid labor turmoil, the independent trade union Solidarity was
legalized in 1980. In December 1981, the government of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski declared martial law and thousands of Solidarity
activists were jailed.
   After negotiations between the Jaruzelski's government and the
opposition, Solidarity's legal status was restored on April 17, 1989.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GOVERNMENT:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party continues to rule, but Jaruzelski has
promised to allow opposition candidates to run for all seats in
parliament in four years.
   Largely democratic elections were held June 4 and June 18.
Solidarity-backed candidates won 99 seats in the newly restored
100-member Senate and they won the maximum they were allowed, 161,
in the National Assembly's more powerful lower house, the 460-member
Sejm.
   The Assembly is expected to soon choose a new president, with
expanded powers and primacy in military and foreign affairs.

   President Bush, cheered by flag-waving
crowds shouting ``long live, long live,'' honored Polish war dead
and Jewish martyrs today and sat down for talks with Polish leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Bush also planned to address the Polish National Assembly, the
only parliament in the Communist world with a freely elected
opposition party, as he began a 10-day European tour.
   Jaruzelski shook hands with Bush at the entrance to the 18th
century Belvedere Palace, and they went inside for two hours of
talks.
   About 2,000 people, including Poles and American tourists, turned
out on a warm, sunny morning to greet Bush at a wreath-laying
ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   Poles shouted ``long live, long live'' and ``100 years, 100
years'' as Bush stepped out of his armored limousine, flown here
from Washington and still bearing District of Columbia license
plates.
   One man carried a banner of the independent Solidarity labor
movement that was topped with a paper cutout of the Statue of
Liberty.
   Jadwiga Staklewska, a secretary at the medical academy in Lodz,
rode a train for two hours to see Bush and began to cry when he
arrived at the memorial.
   ``I came out of sympathy for Bush,'' she said. ``He wants to help
Poland, so that convinced me to come. Only in Bush do I see hope for
our tragic situation.''
   At the military monument, Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched as
two members of an honor guard placed a wreath at the triple
colonnade memorial.
   The president also participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at
Umschlagplatz, an almost unmarked memorial of marble walls
identifying a spot in the Warsaw ghetto where Jews were rounded up
for trains bound for Nazi death camps.
   About 2,000 people showed up at the Jewish monument, where Bush
was accompanied by the only rabbi in Poland, Menachem Jaskowitz, and
Marek Edelman, the last surviving commander of the Jewish ghetto
uprising in April 1943.
   The walls are inscribed with the family names of some of the more
than 300,000 Warsaw Jews who were sent to the camps in 1942-43.
   Bush's two hours of scheduled talks with Jaruzelski, Poland's
Communist Party chief, preceded a speech before a newly constituted
parliament where nearly half the members are members of the
once-banned Solidarity movement.
   The Polish legislators awaited the first details of Bush's new
but limited aid proposal for Poland's battered economy.
   White House officials said Bush's proposals would go ``somewhat
further'' than a package of trade concessions and other incentives
he announced in April. The Los Angeles Times reported today that
Bush was expected to propose the creation of a $100 million fund to
aid the Polish economy, and said he will urge other nations to offer
similar contributions.
   Sensitive to government fears that his visit might spark huge
demonstrations and upset the delicate political situation here, Bush
told reporters Sunday, ``I'm not going to try to put (Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev) in a box by throwing strains on the
Warsaw Pact.''
   Bush said he was in ``a little delicate'' position amid high
expectations among Poles for desperately needed economic aid. ``I
don't want to over-promise, do too little or do too much,'' he said.
   Upon his arrival Sunday night, Bush said ``a new and brighter
future'' is on the horizon for Poland.
   ``Poland has started along an ascending path of change,
democratic change,'' the president said. ``And this climb is
exhilarating, but not always be easy and will require further
sacrifices. But if followed, it will lead to a renaissance for this
remarkable nation.''
   The White House says Poles should be prepared to accept austerity
measures, likely bringing increased unemployment and higher prices
in a country already suffering from 100 percent inflation and a $39
billion foreign debt.
   Bush's visit to Poland is the first stop on a 10-day trip that
will include a meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Gdansk
and the first-ever visit by an American president to Hungary.
   He also will travel to Paris for a seven-nation economic summit
and stop briefly in the Netherlands.
   Despite the lateness of his arrival Sunday, thousands of cheering
Poles lined Bush's motorcade route at 11 p.m., waving Americans
flags and raising the two-finger victory salute of Solidarity, which
trounced the Communists in parliamentary elections.
   Jaruzelski, who in 1981 imposed martial law to crush the
Solidarity movement, was praised by Bush for embracing the
democratic reforms that led to Solidarity's election victory.
   Jaruzelski welcomed Bush as ``an eminent politician and
statesman.''
   He told Bush, ``You are arriving in a country in which a process
of basic change is at work. You are going to see a Poland that is
following with determination the path of profound socio-political
and economic reforms.''
   Solidarity representatives were among 80 guests invited today to
an outdoor lunch with Bush under a huge tent at the U.S.
ambassador's residence.
   Other guests included Jaruzelski, government leaders, academics
and businessmen.
   Bush was to be Jaruzelski's guest tonight at a formal state
dinner.

   Former Sen. Barry Goldwater was doing fine after
hip surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   Surgery was performed Wednesday on the 80-year-old Arizona
Republican's left hip, said Courd Koebergen, a spokesman for St.
Luke's Medical Center.
   He said he did not know how long Goldwater would be hospitalized.
   Goldwater, the patriarch of the GOP's conservative wing, has had
problems with an arthritic hip and knee for years.
   Goldwater underwent knee surgery at St. Luke's in April 1987, to
relive pain stemming from a college football injury. He underwent
hip operations in 1976 and 1981 and had corrective hip surgery in
April 1986.
   He also underwent triple-bypass heart surgery in 1982.

<HEAD>Rejects Shamir's Conditions for Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said his organization no
longer can consider a plan for Palestinian elections because of new
conditions by Israel, The New York Times reported today.
   ``The Likud decision means a deadly blow to elections no matter
what cosmetic fixes they try to put on it now,'' Arafat said in an
interview with the newspaper from Tunis, Tunisia.
   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bowed to
hard-liners within his Likud bloc and agreed to place conditions on
the planned elections of Palestinian representatives to negotiate
with Israel.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization reportedly had been
considering tentative approval of the Israeli plan for elections in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Times said.
   Before its conditional approval, the PLO wanted the plan to
include a role for itself. But that was rejected last week by Shamir.
   Arafat said the United States shared much of the blame for
Israel's new conditions. And he hinted at ending PLO-U.S.
discussions, saying they had accomplished little since they started
late last year.
   The new Israeli conditions for elections include that the
Palestinian uprising would cease first; that residents of mostly
Arab east Jerusalem would not take part in elections; that Jewish
settlements will continue in the West Bank and Gaza; and that Israel
would never agree to give up territory.
   The U.S. agreed to begin a dialogue with the PLO after Arafat
renounced terrorism.
   But the Times said Arafat refused to comment on the bus crash in
Israel last week in which 14 people died after a Palestinian grabbed
the steering wheel and forced the bus to plunge down a ravine.
   He charged that armed Jewish settlers and vigilantes have joined
the Israeli army in trying to quash the Palestinian uprising.
   ``We have not so far given any orders to use weapons, but I have
said many times before that patience has a limit in the face of
crimes committed by settlers and the army against our people,''
Arafat said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strawberry Fields, a corner of Central Park
dedicated to the memory of John Lennon, has attracted a lot of rats,
a newspaper reported today.
   ``I saw a whole family of six or eight. One practically ran right
over my foot,'' longtime upper West Side resident Joyce Searles told
the New York Post.
   Mrs. Searles said she has visited the plot for 30 years _ long
before it was a memorial to the slain Beatle _ but had never seen a
rat there before.
   ``Now, whenever I see a squirrel, I jump,'' she said.
   ``I think it's shocking and I think it gives a bad impression to
all the tourists who come here. People come here with their children
all the time,'' Mrs. Searles said.
   Parks Department spokeswoman Ivy Morrison confirmed that rats
``have made their presence known,'' in Strawberry Fields.
   The park hasn't been using rat poison at Strawberry Fields
because of public concern about the environment, Morrison said.
   The poison affects benign park animals and pets as well as rats,
she said.
   ``We are looking into other alternatives. We prefer to handle it
in some natural way,'' Morrison said.
   One non-polluting way to attack rats is to put up houses for owls
in hopes that the predatory birds move in and start feeding on the
rodents, according to Morrison.
   A $1 million donation from Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, created
Strawberry Fields in an area of Central Park where the couple used
to stroll.
   Lennon was assassinated at his nearby apartment in December 1980.

<HEAD>Jury Deciding Responsibility for Tainted Cheese That Killed 48</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors are being asked to solve a mystery that
has baffled medical investigators for four years: the source of the
deadly bacteria that got into a batch of cheese and killed 48 people.
   The panel, after hearing conflicting expert testimony, must
decide whether Alta-Dena Certified Dairy should share liability with
the defunct Jalisco Mexican Products Inc. for some $100 million in
victims' claims stemming from a 1985 listeriosis outbreak.
   More than 100 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the 18
stricken adults and 30 infants and stillborn fetuses from one of the
nation's deadliest food-transmitted epidemics. The federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta counted 142 cases of listeriosis from
Jan. 1 to Aug. 15, 1985. The epidemic left some survivors with birth
defects.
   Alta-Dena, the largest dairy in California, supplied the raw milk
to Jalisco to make the soft Mexican-style cheese, which was blamed
for the outbreak of the severe, flu-like bacterial disease.
   Victims want Alta-Dena to share responsibility for the outbreak.
   ``Due to the limited nature of funds available for Jalisco, a
number of people involved in litigation are not going to get full
compensation for their injuries and the death of loved ones unless
Alta-Dena is found responsible,'' said lawyer Kimberlee Miller.
   The trial began three weeks ago in Superior Judge Richard
Lavine's courtroom, and testimony is expected to conclude this week.
   Testimony thus far has failed to clarify whether the
contamination came from Alta-Dena's raw milk or from sloppy
pasteurization and dirty conditions at the Jalisco plant.
   ``Alta-Dena sold to Jalisco a product that contained listeria
monocytogenese, and Alta-Dena is partly responsible for this
epidemic,'' Jalisco attorney Roy Brisbois said in opening statements.
   A key witness for Jalisco agreed.
   ``We believe the source of the listeriosis outbreak was raw
milk,'' said epidemiologist Laurene Mascola, a former CDC employee
stationed in Los Angeles at the time of the epidemic.
   But dairy lawyer Raymond Novell told the jury that bacteria was
never found in Alta-Dena milk or dairy herds, and noted that
Alta-Dena supplied 26 million gallons of milk to its customers
during the period and only Jalisco had the listeriosis outbreak.
   The bacteria was found in abundance in refrigerators, ants and
even in the bodies of employees at the Jalisco plant, he said.
   ``There is no mystery here. The mystery is solved if you look at
the Jalisco plant,'' said Novell. Proper pasteurization there would
have killed the listeria bacteria, he said.
   Jalisco cheese maker Jose Luis Medina conceded under
cross-examination that he had allowed unlicensed employees to
pasteurize raw milk. The listeria bacteria is killed in the
pasteurization process.
   Medina and Jalisco owner Gary McPherson pleaded no contest in
1986 to misdemeanor criminal charges. McPherson was sentenced to 30
days in jail and Medina was sentenced to 60 days. They were fined
about $48,000.
   Listeria bacteria are common in the environment, but cause
illness mainly in people with immature or damaged immune systems,
such as babies, elderly people, and AIDS and cancer patients.
Listeriosis is fatal about 30 percent of the time, but can produce
mild to severe flu-like symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain,
headaches and nausea.
   A separate jury will determine the extent of financial liability
if the jury finds Alta-Dena partially responsible for the outbreak.
Numerous separate trials are expected to follow.

<TEXT>
   The couple stood on a
hillside and watched the raging flames, waiting helplessly to see
whether the blaze sweeping this corner of northwest Nebraska would
consume their ranch.
   Rousted from their home of 44 years by firefighters, Anna and
Gayle Oldaker sat with a few belongings crammed into their pickup
truck as fire danced along ridges and through a canyon at Fort
Robinson State Park.
   Thick columns of acrid smoke towered overhead, part of the
20-mile front of the 50,000-acre fire roaring through northwestern
Nebraska.
   Fire trucks were trying to protect the house and other buildings
on the Oldakers' 1,900-acre ranch, adjacent to the state park.
Cattle had been herded away.
   ``We're just hoping the wind don't change,'' the 68-year-old Mrs.
Oldaker said Sunday. ``If the wind changes, I don't know what's
going to happen.''
   The couple earlier had met with Gov. Kay Orr, who declared a
disaster area after viewing the fire and talking to residents.
   Nearly half of the 22,000-acre park was believed to have burned
by Sunday, along with 40,000 acres of private land and other
parkland.
   ``Those pine trees are like kerosene-drenched torches,'' said
state Sen. Sandy Scofield, who lives near the area. Firefighters
were stymied by ``the terrain, the drought, just the nature of a
pine forest ablaze.''
   Except for one firefighter suffering smoke inhalation, and minor
injuries such as cut hands, there have been no injuries in the fire,
officials said.
   By early today, the fire had burned to within one-half mile of
Fort Robinson, the fort established in 1874 that now serves as a
park lodge.
   Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed by guards in 1877 at the
former cavalry post. The fort also witnessed a Cheyenne skirmish in
1876 in which William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody fought.
   Fort Robinson Superintendent Vince Rotherham said more than 600
people were evacuated from the park because of the dense smoke. Most
were campers and had gone their way, said Don McRoberts, deputy
state fire marshal.
   Orr made state disaster funds available and called in the
National Guard to help fight the lightning-sparked fire, which began
Saturday afternoon as three small fires but became what one official
called a ``roaring inferno.''
   Smoke from the fire, raging out of control Sunday night with its
major front nine miles from the Sioux County town of Harrison, could
be seen at Scottsbluff, about 90 miles away.

   Thousands of Poles gave a shouting,
flag-waving welcome to President Bush today and expressed hope that
his visit will give their homeland an economic and emotional boost
at a time of turbulent change.
   About 4,000 spectators greeted Bush and his wife, Barbara, when
they arrived for wreath-laying ceremonies at two monuments honoring
Polish war dead and Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust before the
president's meeting with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The ceremonies took place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on
Victory Square in central Warsaw and about a mile away at
Umschlagplatz, the German word for a square on the edge of the
former Warsaw Ghetto where more than 300,000 Jews were loaded onto
trains bound for the Treblinka death camp in 1942-43.
   ``Long live, long live,'' shouted people at Victory Square when
Bush's black armored limousine pulled up in front of the marble
tomb, which was flanked by a military band and honor guard.
   Some American tourists began singing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner,'' and a few Poles gamely but haltingly joined in.
   To shelter themselves from the bright sun, some spectators made
paper hats out of the Communist daily newspaper, Trybuna Ludu. The
crowd held up one large Solidarity banner, topped with a cutout of
the Statue of Liberty.
   People at both sites spoke of their high expectations for Bush's
visit.
   ``Only in Bush do I see hope for our tragic situation,'' said
Jadwiga Staklewska, a medical academy secretary who rode the train
for two hours from Lodz to see the American president.
   ``He wants to help Poland, so that persuaded me to come,'' she
said, describing how ``my heart soared'' when she heard Bush's
speech on Polish television when he arrived in Warsaw Sunday night.
   ``The Communists are falling and the only thing that will help
this country is assistance,'' said construction worker Ryszard
Bobrek. ``America is a power and President Bush will be able to
convince Europe to do something to help Poland.''
   Maria Czerwinska, a 58-year-old retiree at the Jewish memorial,
carried a shopping bag emblazoned with the name of the independent
Solidarity trade movement, which was legalized again in April.
   ``Like everybody, I hope that due to the visit we will receive
some aid and get some help, including morally and psychologically,
through his presence,'' she said.
   Indicating her bag, she added: ``This would not have been
possible before. I was a member of underground Solidarity and now I
am a member of legal Solidarity.''
   ``All the time I had the feeling that changes were not real,''
she said. ``This lack of faith is very widespread. ... But (now)
there is some hope. For instance, the Senate is our Senate, our
hope.''
   She was referring to Poland's new, freely elected Senate, in
which Solidarity won all but one of the 100 seats.
   Although the Poles said they looked to America for support, many
said their country needs to buckle down and help itself.
   ``I hope things will be better, but to a large extent it is up to
Poles themselves to work properly,'' said Urszula Kozik, a
17-year-old aspiring artist.
   ``It would be good if people saw a motive for good work, so that
working would bring better profits,'' she said.
   At Umschlagplatz, Bush was accompanied by Marek Edelman, a key
Solidarity figure who is the last surviving commander of the Jewish
ghetto uprising in April 1943.
   After the wreath-laying ceremony there, Edelman said he told Bush
that the United States would have to make economic contributions to
help make sure that nothing like the Holocaust occurs again.
   ``Any dictatorship can lead to such a situation,'' Edelman said.
``Rich America must sometimes give a chunk, so that the world can
become free, so that these things do not happen again.''

   Thunderstorms dampened northern Michigan early today and
scattered showers and thunderstorms doused much of Wyoming and
western Montana.
   Collapsing thunderstorms produced strong winds in Wyoming Sunday
evening, with gusts up to 63 mph at Rawlins.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms which developed over
the southern Rockies ended late Sunday. One strong thunderstorm over
Arizona produced high winds that downed trees and power lines at
Winkelman.
   Showers and thunderstorms scattered from the eastern Gulf Coast
to the middle Atlantic Coast also dissipated late Sunday.
   In Georgia, showers and thunderstorms produced nearly 1{ inches
of rain around Atlanta Sunday night, but lingered mainly over the
southeastern part of the state this morning.
   Fair weather prevailed across most of the nation early today,
with hazy conditions over parts of the East.
   Milwaukee-area public beaches and swimming pools were packed
Sunday as the temperature soared to 95.
   ``We're ... going through a lot of chlorine,'' said Dan Shipman,
pool operator at Gordon Park. ``They don't stop coming.''
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over the
lower Great Lakes, the northern Atlantic Coast, the northern Rockies
and the lower Missouri Valley; and sunny skies elsewhere.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s in Maine, upper Michigan,
Washington, most of Oregon and part of the California coast; in the
90s across most of the southern two-thirds of the nation; in the
100s in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 91 degrees at Glendale, Ariz.,
and Las Vegas.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, eagerly
awaiting his visit with George Bush, lavished praise today on the
``fantastic'' American president.
   ``I am fond of him,'' Walesa said in an interview with The
Associated Press at his office at Solidarity's national headquarters
near the Lenin Shipyard.
   ``He is a high-class politician, a great intellect, quite
straightforward, a fantastic president.''
   Walesa will play host to Bush on Tuesday at his home in this
Baltic port city, where the president will also visit a monument to
workers outside the Lenin yard and the Westerplatte Memorial,
marking the spot where World War II began a half-century ago.
   A home-style feast of turkey, veal, pork and beef was being
prepared for the president, aides said.
   Bush and Walesa met in 1987 when the then-vice president visited
Poland. But this will be Walesa's first opportunity to show off his
home territory to the U.S. leader.
   Walesa plans to visit the United States for the first time later
this year.
   Of Bush, Walesa said, ``He does more than he promises. He's
fantastic.''
   Walesa said Solidarity was not making any special effort to turn
out a huge crowd for Bush. ``We're not spectacular,'' he said.
   As for his own plans, the union leader said, ``My secretary will
tell me where and when to be.''

   Chagrined by recent gains of Israeli
hardliners, three top State Department officials are traveling to
Israel next week to determine the prospects of a U.S.-backed
election plan for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   The mission is designed ``to see where the Israeli government
stands'' after the right-wing Likud bloc forced Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to place strict limits on the election plan, said the
source.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who heads the left-leaning Labor
Party, today responded to the Likud actions by urging that his party
quit the governing coalition in protest. Such a move could bring
down the government and, eight months after the last national
elections, force a new vote.
   The Likud bloc last week forced Shamir to modify his election
proposal by, among other things, excluding 140,000 Palestinians
living in East Jerusalem from the balloting. The Palestine
Liberation Organization and the Arab League reacted by declaring the
plan null and urging the United States to remove its support.
   The U.S. delegation will be led by Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger and will include John Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, and Dennis Ross, the
department's top policy planner, a diplomatic source said. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Kelly, who was recently confirmed for his post, was expected to
travel to the Middle East early next month but his trip was pushed
up in view of the developments in Israel, said the source. Ross is
traveling to Europe to meet Secretary of State James Baker who joins
President Bush for his trip to Eastern Europe and the Paris economic
summit.
   At a news conference in Brunei on Friday, Baker described the
Likud restrictions as ``not helpful'' to the election plan's
prospects.
   ``We will continue to try to work with this proposal because we
always thought it offered us the best possibility of getting the
parties into negotiations,'' said one official traveling with Baker.
   But, he added, ``there's no doubt that this makes it harder to
make progress.''
   The elections would be designed to choose Palestinian
representatives authorized to negotiate with Israel a settlement of
the future of the territories occupied by Israel since the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   The official said that if the election idea proves unworkable,
the United States may look more closely at proposals to advance the
peace process through an international conference on the Middle
East. The Soviet Union, as well as many U.S. allies in Europe,
supports such a conference, which would serve as an umbrella for
direct Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   But Israel objects, fearing international pressure, and the
United States has been reluctant to grant the Kremlin a role in the
largely U.S.-dominated Middle East peace process.

<HEAD>Dollar Stable in Light European Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was stable in light trading late this
morning in Europe as investors stayed on the sidelines, uncertain
whether to buy or to sell the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said the dollar had inched back up in early European
trading after Asian sales had taken it lower earlier today. But the
dollar still was well below its levels of late Friday.
   ``People are afraid to sell because they see the dollar still has
some strength in it,'' one Rome trader said. ``But they're afraid to
buy because there's still concern interest rates might come down in
the U.S. We're in a very ambivalent situation.''
   Traders predicted an uneventful day for the dollar as the market
awaited signs of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.
   ``The market has already discounted a rate decrease. Now we're
just waiting for something official to happen,'' another Rome trader
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.37 yen to a closing 139.28 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 139.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.8700 West German marks, down from 1.8840
   _1.6133 Swiss francs, down from 1.6200
   _6.3438 French francs, down from 6.3915
   _2.1077 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1272
   _1,358.50 Italian lire, down from 1,368.00
   _1.1895 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1907
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6237 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6245 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $385.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $382.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $382.65 compared with $384.60 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 29 cents to close at a bid
$383.27.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.24 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $5.37.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's visit was heralded today
by state and opposition newspapers alike, with one proclaiming that
U.S.-Polish relations strained after martial law are now completely
healed.
   New to newsstands since Bush's 1987 visit as vice president is
Gazeta Wyborcza, the first independent daily in the East bloc. It is
edited by supporters of the Solidarity movement.
   Atop its front page was a drawing of the American eagle joined
with the eagle from the Polish national emblem, followed by a story
with highlights from Bush's arrival speech.
   The daily has been published with official permission since the
April restoration of legal status to Solidarity following talks with
the communist government.
   ``The visit definitely undoes the remnants of the period of deep
deterioration of the Washington-Warsaw relations after 1981,'' said
a front-page commentary in the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions after the 1981
military crackdown to crush Solidarity. But as Polish authorities
have carried out reforms in recent years, relations have warmed step
by step.
   Reporters from Solidarity, and television crews with the
movement's logo pasted to their cameras, now join the crowds of
journalists from foreign news agencies and the government-backed
press covering each stop of Bush's itinerary.
   The communist party daily Trybuna Ludu reprinted the airport
remarks by Bush and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and said
their talks were expected to ``begin a new stage in Polish-American
cooperation ... that would foster overcoming Poland's difficulties
and serve building the new Europe based on reciprocal confidence and
understanding.''

   Barbara Bush says she is confident about
security precautions for the first family despite reports of
late-night tours of the White House that reportedly included two
male prostitutes.
   Asked Sunday if she was concerned about security, she brushed off
the suggestion, saying ``Not at all.''
   ``There haven't been a lot of stories in our house about it,''
she said during a brief interview with reporters on Air Force One
during the flight to the Polish capital from Washington.
   Responding to further questions about a Secret Service
investigation of possible late-night White House tours, Mrs. Bush
replied, ``I'm not into all of this.''
   Accompanying her husband on his second trip to Poland in 20
months and his first as president, the first lady predicted her
husband would receive a warm reception.
   Poland is the first stop on a 10-day trip that includes visits to
Hungary, a seven-nation economic summit in Paris and a one-day stay
in the Netherlands.
   ``I think the whole trip is going to be thrilling,'' Mrs. Bush
said.
   Mindful of the hot weather here, she said, ``I wish it was
October-November. The weather is kinder, gentler.''
   Mrs. Bush said she regretted leaving behind her dog, Millie.
   ``She (Millie) cried real tears and did not come out to say
goodbye,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``She did not leave her chair, and when I
went over to say goodbye, there were tears.''

   Palestinian and leftist Lebanese fighters
attacked a joint patrol of Israeli troops and allied militiamen in
south Lebanon today, and three guerrillas were killed in a
counterattack, police said.
   The assault was mounted by guerrillas of the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Struggle Front
and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a pro-Syrian leftist
Lebanese faction, a police spokesman said.
   The raiders opened fire with automatic weapons on the patrol of
the Israeli army and the allied South Lebanon Army militia at the
northern edge of Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south
Lebanon at 8 a.m., said the spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing regulations.
   There were no reports of casualties among the Israelis and their
militia allies.
   Shortly afterward, another joint Israeli-SLA force of 70 fighters
in 13 armored personnel carriers raided suspected guerrilla hideouts
around the village of Dellaya, the spokesman said.
   ``They have punched 3 miles north of the security zone and are
shooting into the bush,'' he said. ``We have a report that three
guerrillas have been killed.''
   He said the joint Israeli-Lebanese force withdrew to the buffer
zone at midday. But Israeli helicopter gunships staged repeated
strafing runs in the area afterwards.

   An opposition party today demanded the ouster of a
Cabinet minister who called women ``useless'' in politics, and six
women from another party went to the prime minister's office to
lodge their protest.
   The Japan Communist Party said Hisao Horinouchi should be fired
as agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister for ``trampling on
fundamental social principles,'' a party official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the party
also called on Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who has been in office
only a month, to resign because of the controversy.
   All 44 Communist Party members of Parliament presented the
request to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa, Kyodo News
Service said.
   The Communist Party said in a statement that ``it is intolerable
to the Japanese people that the government of a nation is being
handled by these people.''
   Meanwhile, six woman from the Japan Socialist Party, the nation's
main opposition group, called at Uno's office, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``The quality (of Horinouchi) as a Cabinet member is severely
questioned,'' he quoted Asae Uemura, a Socialist member of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Assembly, as saying in a message meant for Uno.
   The six women were told they could not meet with Uno because of
his ``tight schedule,'' the official added.
   In a campaign speech Friday for fellow members of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, Horinouchi said women are ``useless in the
world of politics.''
   In a nationally televised news conference on Saturday, he
retracted the remark and apologized.
   Local news reports said he was urged to do so by Uno, who feared
the impact of the remark on women voters in the July 23 elections
for half the seats in the 252-seat upper house of Parliament.
   Uno himself has come under attack from women's groups following
allegations that he kept paid mistresses. He has denied doing
anything immoral.
   Meanwhile, the ``Group of Women Building Tomorrow,'' a
3,000-member pro-Socialist Party organization in Ishikawa prefecture
in northwestern Japan, issued a protest over Horinouchi's remarks,
Kyodo said.
   It quoted the group's statement as saying the remarks ``insulted
not only Japanese women, but also women of the world.''
   The governing party also has been hurt by a widespread
influence-peddling scandal and an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax.
   In Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections July 2, Socialist-backed
candidates tripled their strength in the 128-member body from 12
seats to 36 while the governing party lost 20 seats, leaving it with
43.
   The turnout of women voters surpassed that of men, which analysts
attributed partly to the mistress scandal.
   In another development, a government office today submitted to
Uno recommendations to increase the number of female representatives
on government advisory committees, officials said.
   Female representatives made up only 6.7 percent of the
government's policy advisory committees as of March 31, the report
by the women's office of the prime ministere said.
   The report set a goal of increasing women representatives on
government committees to 10 percent by the end of 1990, and to 15
percent by 2000.

   The man accused of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme proclaimed his innocence today but a court
rejected a defense plea that he be freed for lack of evidence.
   Christer Pettersson is accused of shooting Palme as the prime
minister was walking home after seeing a movie with his wife,
Lisbeth, on Feb. 28, 1986.
   The 42-year-old defendant, asked for a final statement, ended it
saying ``my name is Christer Pettersson and I did not kill Olof
Palme. That is for the moment the only happy thing in this case.''
   Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson in court as the man she saw a
few feet away immediately after her husband fell with a fatal
gunshot wound in the back. Pettersson said he was 17 miles away at
the time.
   The court, adjourning the trial after five weeks, said it would
announce on Thursday the date when it will pronounce a verdict. It
rejected a defense demand for Pettersson's immediate release.
   ``It must simply not happen that an innocent person is sentenced
... and that we have a miscarriage of justice,'' defense counsel
Arne Liljeros told the Stockholm District Court during final
arguments today.
   Liljeros said there was no evidence to support what he called the
unreliable testimony of Mrs. Palme and five other witnesses who said
they saw Pettersson at or near the scene of the shooting.
   The prosecution had no murder weapon, no fingerprints, nor any
trace of gunpowder stains on Pettersson's clothes to link him to the
crime, Liljeros said.
   Pettersson was being tried by a tribunal of two judges and six
jurors, all of whom have an equal vote on the verdict. A majority
vote is sufficient. Pettersson faces a possible life sentence, but
in practice all life sentences are commuted to less than 20 years.
   Liljeros denounced Mrs. Palme for what he said was her lack of
cooperation during the investigation and for setting conditions
before appearing in court. He also criticized the court for
accepting the conditions.
   ``There's no excuse for her behavior here in court,'' Liljeros
complained. ``Her rigid demands and lack of respect for normal
practice in this case (should) disqualify her evidence.''
   Mrs. Palme, who appeared June 19, demanded that Pettersson be
removed from the courtroom while she testified and that her
testimony not be recorded on tape. The court agreed to close an
adjoining press area, but rejected her demand that she testify
behind closed doors.
   Pettersson was brought into the courtroom at the end of her
testimony for her identification. She said she was certain he was
the man she saw when she looked up for help as her husband was dying.
   Liljeros complained that he was prevented from watching her
during a videotaped police lineup when she first identified
Pettersson.
   She also refused to view the videotape again in the courtroom,
said Liljeros.
   The attorney pleaded with the court to give credence to a defense
witness, Algot Asell, who claimed he saw Pettersson at a suburban
train station about the time of the shooting and was the only
witness to support Pettersson's alibi.
   Pettersson testified he was in town that night to get a supply of
drugs. On the way home he fell asleep and missed his regular stop.
His late arrival home was cited by the prosecution as showing that
he had time to commit the murder.

<TEXT>
   A former Sunday school teacher who
authorities say was on the run for 18 years after slaying his
children, wife and mother, spent the day before his arraignment
reading the Bible in his cell, an officer said.
   The man identified as John E. List, 63, who allegedly shot his
oldest son 10 times, and shot his wife, mother and two other
children once each in the back, was kept in jail Sunday for his own
safety, said a corrections officer who declined to give his name.
   ``We wouldn't let him go to church,'' the officer said. ``It's
too risky. We don't want to have to answer how he got hurt by
another prisoner.''
   The man, who goes by the name of Robert P. Clark, was arrested
last month in Richmond, Va., and charged with the Nov. 9, 1971,
killings. He has denied he is List, but authorities say fingerprints
and a scar prove List and Clark are the same man.
   He was to be arraigned this afternoon before Superior Court Judge
William Wertheimer.
   The bodies of List's wife and children were not found until a
month after the killings, neatly laid side-by-side in the ballroom
of their 19-room mansion in nearby Westfield. The body of his
85-year-old mother was discovered in an upstairs bedroom.
   A worldwide manhunt ensued, but all leads hit dead ends until
June 1, when the suspect was arrested at the Richmond accounting
firm where he had worked for 18 months. FBI agents had been tipped
off by a viewer of the national television program, ``America's Most
Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment focusing on List.
   Authorities say List fled to Colorado, then Virginia and built a
new life as Robert Clark without changing his appearance, profession
or reputation as a quiet churchgoing Lutheran.
   He had remarried and his new wife said she knew nothing of his
alleged past, but that she would stand by him.
   The officer at the Union County Jail said List's wife has not
visited him.

   Syrian and Christian gunners duelled with
howitzer shells and rockets across Beirut today and street gun
battles between rival Shiite factions ebbed into sporadic sniping.
   In south Lebanon, Palestinian and leftist Lebanese guerrillas
attacked a patrol of Israeli troops and allied militiamen, prompting
a massive counterattack that left three guerillas dead, police said.
   Police said Syrian artillery emplacements in west Beirut and
north Lebanon shelled Christian residential districts and the coast
north of Beirut at dawn, maintaining a four-month blockade of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Gunners of the mostly Christian troops of army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun retaliated by shelling the seaside districts of Ein
Mreisseh and Maramel, said a police spokesman. He cannot be named
under standing regulations.
   He said two people were killed and five wounded in the overnight
bombardment, raising the overall toll to 405 killed and 1,581
wounded since the Syrian-Christian confrontation broke out March 8.
   Police said Syrian troops in charge of west Beirut's security
deployed in the coastal residential districts of Jnah and Ouzai,
restoring traffic between Beirut and south Lebanon and disengaging
warring militiamen of the pro-Syrian Amal movement and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Syrian officers on the scene said they do not plan to go into the
narrow alleyways of both Shiite slums while the two warring factions
were staging funerals for their dead.
   Occasional sniper fire marred the truce called at midnight after
daylong clashes with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine
guns that trapped thousands of sunbathers on nearby beaches.
   They were evacuated at sundown, when the Syrian command arranged
a one-hour ``mercy cease-fire'' and sent in armored personnel
carriers that brought out the trapped sunbathers.
   Police said 10 people were killed and 23 wounded in Sunday's
hostilities. That raised the overall toll to 18 killed and 51
wounded since the current Amal-Hezbollah confrontation erupted 10
days ago.
   The two factions have been vying for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest Moslem sect.
   The spiraling hostilities made it clear that Arab League
troubleshooter Lakhdar Ibrahimi failed to make a headway during four
days of talks with Christian and Moslem leaders in Beirut.
   Ibrahimi represented an Arab League committee seeking a solution
to the 14-year-old civil war.
   The independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar said Aoun rejected
Syria's conditions for lifting the enclave's siege.
   These conditions, An-Nahar said, included the formation of a
security committee made up of Lebanese and Arab League
representatives to oversee the cease-fire, search ships heading to
Christian ports and remove surface-to-surface missiles from the
enclave.
   Syria contends Aoun has recently acquired the missiles from Iraq,
Syria's main Arab foe. The missiles, which have a range of 43 miles,
can hit the Syrian capital of Damascus from Lebanon's central
mountains.
   Also today, Druse parliamentary deputy Bashir Awar, 76, died of a
heart attack, reducing the number of surviving members of Lebanon's
99-seat Parliament to 74.
   The current unicameral house was elected for a four-year term in
1972. The civil war prevented new elections and Parliament had been
extending its term once every two years.
   The parliament, however, has been unable to convene for the last
11 months to elect a successor to former President Amin Gemayel,
whose term expired Sept. 22.
   That created a political crisis that split the government along
sectarian lines and generated the fighting between Christians and
Syria.

<HEAD>White Supremacist Demonstration Broken Up By Anti-Racist Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERRY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten white supremacists gave up their protest
of a market that sells kosher foods after they found themselves
outnumbered by about 200 anti-racism demonstrators.
   Sunday's Ku Klux Klan rally, staged at the Taylor County
Courthouse, was intended to protest Tom's Foods, which prepares some
of its food according to Jewish law. KKK members say they think U.S.
food companies are being ``infiltrated'' through the certification
of kosher foods.
   The protest ended after about an hour and a half when the seven
white-robed Klansmen, one skinhead and his girlfriend, and a Klan
member in plain clothes grew tired of the counter-demonstrators, who
sang peace songs and carried anti-racist signs.
   ``I'm a little bit disappointed,'' said John Baumgardner, the
Grand Dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
``We wanted to go over there and try to educate those people, but
the police wouldn't let us.''
   Tony Bastanzio, the leader of a Klan group called the Dixie
Knights, which scheduled the demonstration, said he canceled the
kosher rally because he didn't want to challenge the anti-racist
group.
   The 30 police officers patrolling the area would not allow any
interaction between the two groups, which were separated by a police
line. Police officers frisked everyone who entered the demonstration
site.
   Taylor County Sheriff John Walker said one counter-demonstrator,
from Gainesville, was arrested for carrying two concealed weapons.
No injuries were reported.
   ``I'm delighted this is over,'' Walker said, ``and we're very
pleased that both sides were cooperative.''
   Stephanie Gray, who helped organize a Tallahassee coalition of
counter-demonstrators, said the demonstration was a success.
   ``I think there's a lot of real positive emotions here,'' Ms.
Gray said. ``We've got plenty of support here. We've definitely got
them outnumbered.''
   But the white supremacists say they weren't impressed.
   ``I've always been a racist,'' said John DeFreeuw, a 21-year-old
skinhead. ``There's no such thing as racial harmony _ just look
around.''

<HEAD>Biologists Study Dolphin Found Dead in Hudson River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine biologists today studied the body of a
bottlenosed dolphin for clues to why it strayed into the East River
and then swam 50 miles up the Hudson River, where it died.
   A preliminary look at the dead dolphin shows it had ``severe and
significant skin lesions and skin sloughing because of the fresh
water,'' said Dr. Samuel Sadove of the Okeanos Ocean Research
Foundation.
   ``There are also a number of old healed wounds that are quite
large,'' he said.
   The dolphin, which Sadove said was an adult female weighing
between 500 and 600 pounds, was found floating Sunday afternoon in
the Hudson River off the town of Garrison, about 50 miles north of
New York City.
   The mammal's death ``was not totally unexpected,'' Sadove said,
adding that it was last seen alive on Saturday.
   The dolphin was first noticed on June 20 in the East River off
Manhattan. It stayed there for about 11 days, attracting a steady
stream of curious onlookers.
   The gray, 5-foot-long animal resisted the efforts of biologists
who tried to drive it out to open seas by banging on pipes in the
water.
   Two weeks ago, the dolphin headed north up the Hudson, forcing
scientists to scuttle plans to scare it toward the ocean by playing
recorded killer-whale sounds underwater.
   Sadove declined to speculate on what caused the animal's death.

<HEAD>Congressman Says He's Satisfied With Navy's Handling of Iowa Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARTERVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman asked to investigate
information leaks during the probe of the gun turret explosion
aboard the battleship Iowa says he found no evidence that Navy
officials acted improperly.
   ``I have found nothing to indicate in my inquiry that the Navy,
at least officially, has acted irresponsibly,'' said Rep. Glenn
Poshard, D-Ill.
   Poshard was asked to investigate by the father of Gunner's Mate
3rd Class Kendall Truitt, a sailor who reportedly has been the focus
of the Navy's investigation. Truitt's father lives in Poshard's
district.
   The April 19 explosion killed 47 men, including Gunner's Mate
Clayton Hartwig, who had named Truitt as the sole beneficiary of a
$50,000 life insurance policy.
   News reports have cited unidentified sources as saying the Navy
was investigating the possibility of a homosexual relationship
between the two men. There also was speculation that Hartwig may
have caused the blast to commit suicide or that Truitt had
orchestrated it to kill Hartwig.
   Poshard said Saturday that he is satisfied with the Navy's
handling of the probe, although he added that he felt sorry for
Truitt.
   ``Kendall Truitt is a young man caught up in the most unfortunate
of circumstances,'' Poshard said. ``I feel a great deal of sympathy
for Truitt, because he and his family have had to endure more than
most people endure in ten lifetimes, and perhaps all of it
unjustly.''
   He said the Navy is still investigating the leaks.
   ``What we have here is a bureaucratic investigation too large to
control every comment from every source,'' Poshard said. ``I can't
point my finger at the Navy, and I can't at the media. I don't know
who's to blame.''
   Truitt last week criticized the Navy's investigation and
complained of harassment by the Navy and the news media. He also
said drug use was rampant on the Iowa, and that he and Hartwig were
among the few in the turret crew who did not use drugs.
   A Navy spokeswoman in Norfolk, Va., declined comment on the case.

   The Libyan government has banned smoking in public

Libyan news agency JANA said today.
   The agency, monitored in Rome, said the government decided on
June 26 to impose the ban for public health reasons but did not
publish the decision until Sunday.
   The ban will prohibit smoking at public places such as government
institutions, schools and cinemas and on most forms of public
transportation.
   JANA said the ban is part of an intensive anti-smoking campaign
that will use material from the World Health Organization to
emphasize the dangers to public health.

   Fires raged out of control in eight states today and more than
600 people fled a Nebraska park where a lightning-sparked blaze
burned to within a half-mile of the historic fort where Sioux Chief
Crazy Horse was killed.
   A blaze also threatened the ancient Indian cliff dwellings of
Mesa Verde in Colorado, and an arson fire swept toward the Ventana
wilderness in the mountains rising from Big Sur, 120 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Major fires also were burning in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Oregon and Wyoming.
   Cooler temperatures and rain helped nearly extinguish wilderness
fires in Montana and Alaska.
   In northwestern Nebraska, about 100 firefighters battled the
biggest fire in the West, a 50,000-acre blaze that leapfrogged along
a 22-mile front at Fort Robinson State Park. About 30 National
Guardsmen entered the fray after Gov. Kay Orr declared a disaster
area.
   The flames leapt through the rugged canyons, leaving splotches of
charred ground mixed with stretches of grass and stands of timber.
   ``There's a limit to what humans can do to fight a fire when it's
in those canyons,'' said state Sen. Sandy Scofield, who lives
nearby. ``Those pine trees are like kerosene-drenched torches.''
   Four patients were evacuated from a hospital and 25 from a
nursing home in Crawford, a nearby town of 1,300 people. One
firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation, but his condition was
not serious, said deputy state fire marshal Jerry Larson.
   ``The main body of the fire has been contained, but there are
fingers burning out there'' still out of control, he said this
morning.
   By early today, the fire had consumed nearly half the 22,000-acre
park and spurs of the fire were within half a mile of Fort Robinson,
the former cavalry post where Crazy Horse was killed by guards in
1877. The fort now serves as a lodge.
   The fire made a mushroom-shaped cloud of smoke that could be seen
from Scottsbluff, about 90 miles away.
   ``It's not a pretty sight, but these people have things well
under control,'' said Orr, after flying around the edges of the
blaze.
   ``We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said Marc
Anthony, a state game and parks commissioner who also flew over the
area.
   More than 600 people were evacuated from the park because of the
dense smoke, said Fort Robinson Superintendent Vince Rotherham. Most
were campers.
   Near Big Sur, in California, 600 firefighters using bulldozers,
helicopters and air tankers struggled with heavy brush on the steep,
roadless hillsides. They expected to have the blaze controlled by
tonight, said Lonnie Smith, a forestry spokesman in King City.
   The fire was set with an incendiary device, Smith said Sunday.
   ``There was no fog this morning, so that helped the fire just
romp all night,'' he said.
   A wind-fanned wildfire charred 3,500 acres of remote brush and
destroyed seven buildings in Lassen County, about 300 miles
northeast of San Francisco, and another consumed 2,000 acres of
timber in the nearby Plumas National Forest.
   A brush fire scorched more than 3,000 acres Sunday in the Laguna
Mountains, 40 miles east of San Diego.
   In Arizona, rain helped firefighters contain a 9,200-acre fire in
and around the Saguaro National Monument east of Tucson, and four
other fires were nearly under control late Sunday. But about 40,000
acres of forest and range land, from the Grand Canyon to Mexico,
burned on. A 1,000-acre blaze briefly threatened President Theodore
Roosevelt's hunting cabin in Grand Canyon.
   A brush fire eight miles west of Boulder, Colo., destroyed 42
structures and forced 200 people to flee. Two firefighters were
treated for smoke inhalation.
   Gov. Roy Romer issued an executive order Sunday night banning all
open fires west of Interstate 25, which bisects the state.
   In Mesa Verde National Park, archaeologists were helping
firefighters protect ancient Indian cliff dwellings from a fire that
had grown to 2,350 acres. The 12th century structures are among the
oldest in the United States, built by an unknown people who later
disappeared.
   The Diamond Creek fire, which consumed some 12,500 acres in
eastern Utah, was 80 percent contained by Sunday morning, said Mary
Plumb, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land Management's Moab
District.
   Higher humidity and less wind helped firefighters get the upper
hand on a 10,000-acre fire in the Gila National Forest in
southwestern New Mexico.
   A fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming slowed
thanks partly to cooler weather Sunday.
   More than 350 firefighters fought two blazes in Fremont National
Forest in Oregon.

   About 300 bicyclists resumed a
cross-country trek to raise money for cancer research despite a
hit-and-run accident that killed one member and injured another.
   ``It's thrown a somber pall over the whole group,'' said Bob
Carson of Oceanside, Calif. ``It took everybody down. We're like a
family. We've been together for four weeks.''
   Jeff Green, 36, of Dallas, died Sunday when he was struck on his
bicycle on Indiana 49 south of Valparaiso, the Porter County
Sheriff's Department said.
   Green and Gerald Wright, 39, of Silverdale, Wash., were riding
southbound when they were struck by a southbound car that left the
scene, police said.
   Green was pronounced dead at Porter Memorial Hospital in
Valparaiso, and Wright was treated for a broken leg and released,
police said.
   The two were among a group pedaling from Seattle to Atlantic City
to raise funds for the American Lung Association. The two men were
traveling by themselves on the 35th day of the journey when the
accident occurred.
   The other riders found out about Green's death at the halfway
point between Valparaiso and Delphi. They spent the night at Delphi
before continuing on to Indianapolis today.

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
speech Monday to the Polish National Assembly:
   Chairman Jaruzelski, Marshal Kozakiewicz and Stelmachowski, Prime
Minister Rakowski and Senators and Delegates. On behalf of the
people of the United States, I am honored to greet the newly elected
representatives of the Polish Parliament. To be here with you on
this occasion is proof that we live in extraordinary, indeed,
thrilling times.
   The power and potential of this moment was first made clear to me
when I saw a photo, a world-wide photo flashed all around the world,
a photo of General Jaruzelski, Senator Leader, Lech Walesa, shoulder
to shoulder _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa _ shoulder to shoulder
at the opening session of this Parliament, committed to new progress
in Poland. Believe me, that sent a wonderful signal all around the
world.
   Poland and the United States are bound, it is often said, by ties
of kinship and culture, but our peoples are linked by more than
sentiment.
   The May 3rd Constitution of 1791 set Poland ahead of her peers _
ahead of her time in the pursuit of freedom and democratic ideas,
just as our Constitution, the American Constitution of 1787, set new
standards for protection of the rights of the individual.
   For decades, beginning with the Versailles Peace Conference, the
United States has stood for Polish independence, freedom,
prosperity. And we are proud of our early and long-standing
commitment to Polish self-determination. As America's President, I
am here today to reaffirm that proud commitment.
   I understand something of the work you are commencing, for I
began my own public service in the American Congress. Democratically
chosen legislatures are among mankind's greatest forums for debate
and dialogue. And while I've been to Poland before, I did not expect
to return so soon nor to such altered circumstances in your country
and so, too, perhaps many of you didn't expect to be here serving in
this or any Polish parliament and your achievement has surpassed all
expectations and has earned all our admiration.
   Our meeting today bears witness to the character of our age. Some
450 years ago, when the Polish astronomer Copernicus came to
understand the natural order of the planets and had the courage to
question accepted wisdom, the world was changed forever.
   From this year forward, as Poland works to reaffirm the natural
order of man and government, so, too, will Poland be changed
forever. For today, the scope of political and economic change in
Poland is indeed Copernican _ a fundamental change in perspective
that places the people at the center _ a new understanding that the
governed are the true source of lasting social peace and economic
prosperity, around which government revolves and exists to serve.
   Poland has a rich democratic heritage. The May 3rd Constitution
was a stroke of genius. Today at the dawn of the document's third
century, you're called upon to match its genius with contemporary
action to make a peaceful transition toward political and economic
renewal through representative government that expresses the will of
the people.
   I said a few weeks ago here in Europe that East and West have
arrived at the end of one era and at the beginning of another.
Chairman Jaruzelski recently said of Poland that the life of the
nation has undergone deep changes; society has the full right to ask
when a ray of sun will shine over Poland. In truth, this applies not
just to Poland, but to the entirety of relations between East and
West.
   A profound cycle of turmoil and great change is sweeping the
world from Poland to the Pacific. It is sometimes inspiring, as here
in Warsaw, and sometimes it's agonizing, as in China today. But the
magnitude of change we sense around the world compels us to look
within ourselves and to God to forge a rare alloy of courage and
restraint.

   The future beckons with both hope and uncertainty. Poland and
Hungary find themselves at a crossroads: each has started down its
own road to reform without guarantee of easy success. The people of
these nations and the courage of their leaders command our
admiration.
   The way is hard but the moment is right, both internally and
internationally, for Poland to walk its own path.
   On the day Solidarity was restored, I spoke of my support and
admiration for the political experiment just getting underway in
Poland. You have since proceeded further along that road, including
holding the remarkable elections that produced this Parliament. And
let us consider what your experiment may mean, not just for Poland
but for Europe and for the entire world.
   The divided world of the modern age began here _ right here in
Poland _ 50 years ago this summer. Your country, and then nearly all
of Europe was first besieged and then occupied by totalitarian
despotic forces.
   A courageous Poland was our ally. In that fearful time, Franklin
Roosevelt and Winston Churchill devised the Atlantic Charter, which
outlined principles on which we hoped to build a better world,
including freedom from want and fear and the right of peoples to
choose the form of government under which they will live. But as you
know better than anyone, the world that we sought then was not to be.
   Stalinist systems were imposed over a third of the continent; the
Cold War began; the countries of the West organized themselves in
defense of democratic principles; and we proposed taht the Marshall
Plan include Eastern Europe. But again, that was not to be.
   The Western strategy, our strategy of containment was a means but
was never an end in itself. There was no substitute for a free and
united Europe and we did not forget the frustrated and lost hopes of
1945 nor the promise of a better world. Neither did the Polish
people. You've been a crucible of conflict; you're now becoming a
vessel for change.
   Poland is where the Cold War began, and now the people of Poland
can help bring the division of Europe to an end. The time has come
to move beyond containment to a world too long deferred, a better
world.
   And now, at long last, two developments have allowed us to redeem
the principles of the Atlantic Charter, for which the United States
and Poland fought as allies.
   One is the manifest failure of the classic Stalinist system, and
the other is the indomitable will of the people, through leaders in
Poland and Hungary who are working to overcome the mistakes of the
past with honesty, creativity, and yes, courage. The world watches
in admiration.
   And now, in part because of what you're doing here, the genuine
opportunity exists for all of us to build a Europe which many
thought was destroyed forever in the 1940s. That Europe, the Europe
of our children, will be open, whole and free.
   We can make it so in two ways.
   First, a new East-West relationship must rest on greatly reduced
levels of arms. I notice what General Jaruzelski said on that point,
and I support him. We in the West have proposed dramatic reductions
in conventional armed forces in Europe, reductions that promise to
transform the military map of Europe and diminish the very threat of
war.
   The new willingness in Moscow to accept this Western framework
for reductions in troops and tanks and aircraft and other categories
of weapons gives us hope that the negotiations in Vienna will
succeed. A good beginning has been made. Constructive proposals are
being offered on both sides. We are determined to push hard for an
early and successful conclusion to these talks.
   Second, reductions in military forces will go further and be more
sustainable if they take place in parallel with political change.
Excessive levels of arms, we believe, are the symptom, and not the
source of political tensions.

<HEAD>WARSAW: political tensions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Europe, those tensions spring from an unnatural and cruel
division.
   Poland's decision to embrace political reform and Hungary's
movement in the same direction thus have great importance beyond
their borders by creating political structures legitimized by
popular will.
   By that, your reforms can be the foundation of stability,
security, and prosperity, not just here, but in all of Europe, now
and into the next century.
   Mikhail Gorbachev has written, ``Universal security rests on the
recognition of the right of every nation to choose its own path of
social development and on the renunciation of interference in the
domestic affairs of other states. A nation may choose either
capitalism or socialism. This is its sovereign right.'' End of
quotation.
   In principle, I agree, but I might well have said that the people
of a nation may freely choose either a free-market economy or
socialism. That is their right.
   And so the West works, not to disrupt, not to interfere, not to
threaten any nation's security, but to help forge closer and
enduring ties between Poland and the rest of Europe.
   As a result of the roundtable accords, Poland's fate lies more
than ever in Polish hands, and there it must ever remain.
   Your responsibility for your country's future is immense.
Poland's friends, including the American people, want Poland to be
free, prosperous, democratic, independent, true to the best
tradition of your nation's past.
   And this regime _ this regime is moving forward with a sense of
realism and courage in a time of great difficulty and challenge.
   Lech Walesa and Solidarity are deeply committed to institutions
in Poland that will serve all its people.
   This parliament, by its very existence, is advancing pluralism.
   And the Church has served as a source of spiritual guidance and
unity in turbulent times.
   But above all, there are the people of Poland, people who are
steadfastly working toward productive change.
   And yet, even under the best circumstances, representative
government has its own challenges that require patience, tolerance,
and give and take between political opponents. But its virtue is
that it grants legitimacy to leaders and their policies; it gives
governments and societies the mandate to make hard choices and,
through their involvement, it gives the people a stake in the
choices that are made.
   For over 200 years, Americans have wrestled over political and
economic interests, over individual and civil rights, and the role
of a loyal opposition.
   Democracy is not a conclusion, it's a process and perfecting it
never ends. But history has taught Americans one very clear lesson:
democracy works.
   We understand in my country the enormous economic problems you
face. Economic privation is a danger that can threaten any great
democratic experiment, and I must speak honestly, economic reform
and recovery cannot occur without sacrifices.
   Even in an economy as productive as ours, we still debate the
roles and limits of government, how to regulate the private sector
without discouraging innovation, how to reduce our own enormous
budget deficit, how to balance workers' needs and industrial
efficiency, how to handle the painful disruptions of change for the
sake of productivity, the sake of progress, for the sake of
prosperity.
   The reform of the Polish economy presents an historic challenge.
There can be no substitute for Poland's own efforts, but I want to
stress to you today that Poland is not alone. Given the enormity of
this moment, the United States stands ready to help, as you help
yourselves.
   In Hamtramck, Michigan, three months ago, I outlined a policy of
support for the reforms then just beginning in Poland. I proposed
specific steps, carefully chosen, to recognize the reforms underway
here and to encourage reforms yet to come. It is a policy built on
dynamic interplay of progress in Poland and Western engagement, and
not on unsound credits made without regard to necessary reforms.
That was the record of the 1970s.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania today accused President Bush of
seeking to destabilize East European countries, in an official
editorial coinciding with his visit to reform-oriented Poland and
Hungary.
   ``It is quite obvious that President Bush urges ...
destabilization in socialist countries,'' said an editorial in the
government daily Romania Libera.
   Bush's positions on the reform ``flagrantly run counter to the
principles and norms of international laws,'' said an English
translation of the editorial carried by the official Agerpres news
agency and monitored in Vienna.
   Bush arrived in Warsaw Sunday and travels on to Budapest Tuesday
for the first visit to Hungary by a U.S. president.
   Communist Party chief Nicolae Ceausescu is one of the most
adamant opponents within the East bloc of political and economic
reforms like those under way in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   The editorial came just two days after leaders of the seven
Warsaw Pact countries issued a communique in which they declared
they would not interfere in each other's affairs.
   However, the official Romanian editorial applied the agreement to
East-West relations, alleging ``attempts to interfere in the
domestic affairs of the socialist (communist) countries.'' It
referred to the West in general and the United States in particular.
   Romania in the 1960s and 1970s drew praise in the West for
Ceausescu's maverick foreign policy and Presidents Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford visited Bucharest in 1969 and 1975 respectively. At that
time Romania was criticized by its Warsaw Pact allies for hosting
the two presidents.
   Bush visited Romania as Vice President in September 1983.
   However, Romania has in recent years increasingly come under fire
both from Western nations and from neighboring Hungary and
Yugoslavia for alleged human rights violations.
   Last year, the United States suspended Romania's most-favored
nation trading status.
   Bush has pledged U.S. support for reforms in Poland and Hungary,
but in an interview last week with Hungarian journalists he
emphasized that Washington should not meddle in the domestic affairs
of Warsaw Pact nations or prescribe what kind of reform to undertake.

<HEAD>57 Moslem Extremists Arrested; Terror School Alleged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of extremist Moslem fundamentalists
were arrested today for allegedly turning a religious summer school
into a terrorist training camp for boys, a security source said.
   The source said police arrested 57 people early today to break up
the school for children as young as 7 years old at Zagazig, capital
of the Nile Delta province of Sharkiya. The city is about 50 miles
northeast of Cairo.
   About 40 boys ages 7 to 15 were recruited by extremists who
``trained them in the use of violence and incited them with lectures
to hate the present system of government,'' said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He gave no specifics on that but said the extremists exploited
the boys' summer school holidays, which began last month, for
lessons in terrorism. He said the lessons occurred in the courtyard
of a religious institute but refused to identify the institute.
   Moslem fundamentalists advocate implementation of Sharia, the
ethical and legal code enshrined in Islam's holy book the Koran and
the teachings of the prophet Mohammed. The government maintains that
more than 90 percent of its laws already conform to Sharia and that
the rest will be brought in line gradually.
   President Hosni Mubarak's government systematically cracks down
on violence-prone fundamentalists, invoking an emergency law in
force since Moslem extremists assassinated Mubarak's predecessor
Anwar Sadat in Cairo in 1981. The law gives police wide powers,
including detention without trial.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr, whose ministry is responsible for
internal security, said in April that more than 1,000 Moslem
extremists were in custody. There has been no official update since.

   Three dogs who accompanied a 3-year-old boy
on a ``pretend'' fishing trip probably saved the child's life when
he was lost in a forest for two days and nights, an emergency room
physician said.
   Dr. Robert L. Norton, who examined Joseph Edwin Leffler at
University Hospital, said the canines kept the boy alive by sleeping
next to him through the 40-degree nights.
   The toddler became the object of an intense weekend search by
about 300 people after disappearing Friday. He came out of the
woods, with the three dogs trotting alongside him, shortly before
noon Sunday.
   The boy had told his mother he was going on a ``pretend fishing
trip'' after lunch Friday. His parents assumed he was going to play
in the backyard of the house about 25 miles southeast of Portland.
   Norton, an emergency room physician, said the boy was hungry and
had wet feet but his vital signs were normal. The child spent the
afternoon at the hospital before being sent home, hospital
spokeswoman Lee Husk said.
   ``I knew that if any 3-year-old could survive, Joe could do it,''
said his mother, Judy Leffler, as the boy gave a ``thumbs up'' sign
from his small stretcher.
   The boy came into view about three-quarters of a mile from where
he was last seen, said Lt. Neil James of the Clackamas County
sheriff's office.
   ``I couldn't believe this little boy was just walking toward
me,'' said Judy Magill, who had helped in the search. ``He stretched
out his arms, and I picked him up.''
   The boy's father, Daniel Leffler, said his wife feared an
abduction, especially after a Portland television station got a call
from a youthful prankster who said the boy had been kidnapped and
killed.

   Poland and the United States need not repeat that. Our efforts
will be carefully targeted in support of an emerging new Poland.
   We've made progress on the steps announced at Hamtramck and this
is where we stand.
   Legislation is well underway that will help Polish exporters
compete more effectively in the U.S. market through generalized
systems of preferences and that will authorize our Overseas Private
Investment Corporation to operate in Poland providing investment
insurance and setting up missions to stimulate U.S. investment in
joint ventures here.
   The United States is proposing a private business agreement that
will promote contacts between Poland's growing private business
sector and its American counterparts. We hope to conclude an
agreement soon to build on what promises to be an unprecedented
opportunity.
   There is great interest and excitement in the United States about
what you're doing in Poland and a clear-cut desire to help the
reform process. I hosted a White House symposium on July 6 to bring
together citizens of my country interested in promoting investment,
trade and academic exchange with Poland and Hungary. And I can
assure you that more than ever before the American people will be
involved in your democratic experiment.
   I've said that as Poland reforms itself, the U.S. will respond.
Much has happened even in the short time since Hamtramck, so today
I'm pleased to announce that we plan to do more and go farther for
the sake of a stable and prosperous Poland.
   First, I will propose at the upcoming economic summit in Paris
that the nations of the summit, that summit seven, intensify their
coordination and concerted action to promote democratic reform in
Poland and Hungary and to help manage compassionately the process of
change.
   We will work with our partners at the summit, moving quickly with
increased Western aid and technical assistance. This concerted
action will complement existing institutions like the World Bank,
the Paris Club and IMF and address needed economic reforms, credits,
management and training initiatives, social safety nets, housing and
other issues important to Poland.
   Second, I will ask the United States Congress to provide a $100
million fund to capitalize and invigorate the Polish private sector,
and we will encourage parallel contributions from other nations of
the economic summit.
   Third, I will encourage the World Bank to move ahead with $325
million in economically-viable loans to help Polish agriculture and
industry reach the production levels they are so clearly capable of.
   And fourth, I will ask my counterparts in the West to support an
early and generous rescheduling of Polish debt. This could provide
deferral of debt payments amounting to about $5 billion this year,
if our allies and friends in the Paris Club agree to join us in
offering liberalized terms. I plan to discuss this issue with my
colleagues at the Paris summit.
   Fifth, economic progress should not come at the expense of our
common heritage, our common inheritance, the environment. In fact,
sound ecology and a strong economy can and must coexist. Air and
water pollution know no boundaries and this concern is worldwide.
Almost two years ago, I visited Krakow and your formal royal
capital, a city recognized by UNESCO as an international treasure.
Today, Krakow is under seige by pollution; its priceless monuments
are being destroyed. Krakow must be reclaimed, and the United States
will help. And I'll ask the Congress for $15 million for a
cooperative venture with Poland to help fight air and water
pollution there.
   Sixth, and finally, when I begin my remarks _ when I began them,
I mentioned the shared cultured heritage of our two nations. Today,
I'm proud to announce that my country, proud to announce that the
United States will establish a cultural and information center in
Warsaw, and will ask Poland to establish a similar center in the
United States. This will be the first time that either of our two
countries will be able to conduct educational and cultural programs
outside of our embassies and consulates.
   The elections, which brought us, all of us, together here today,
mean that the path the Polish people have chosen is that of
political pluralism and economic rebirth.
   The road ahead is a long one, but it is the only road which leads
to prosperity and social peace.
   Poland's progress along this road will show the way toward a new
era throughout Europe _ an era based on common values and not just
geographic proximity.
   The Western democracies will stand with the Polish people and
other peoples of this region.
   Democracy has captured the spirit of our time. Like all forms of
government, though it may be defended, democracy can never be
imposed.
   We believe in democracy, for without doubt, though democracy may
be a dream for many, it remains in my view, the destiny of man.
   Two hundred years ago, demcratic constitutions were adopted by
three nations, embodying the powerful influence of the Enlightenment
as a testament to ideas that endure.
   The American Constitution was first and has stood the test of
history for the over 200 years of our existence as a republic.
   Constitutional democracy in France began two centuries ago this
summer and in a few days, leaders from all over the world will be in
Paris to celebrate the anniversary of its birth.
   On May 3rd, 1991, the Polish Constitution will also be 200 years
old. Your Constitution of 1791 was crushed but never forgotten and
now this generation's calling is to redeem the promise of a free
Polish republic. Poland has not been lost so long as the Polish
spirit lives.
   America wishes you well as you face the tough problems today. I
salute General Jaruzelski for his leadership and his extraordinary
hospitality to me.
   I salute the leaders and members of these two great legislative
bodies.
   God, in his infinite wisdom and love, is with us in this chamber.
May God bless you and your efforts. Long live Poland. Long live
Poland. Thank you very much.

   Poland's new National Assembly made its
warm welcome of President Bush evident today in unorthodox fashion
for a legislative body.
   It serenaded him.
   As Bush and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took their
seats at the front of the combined meeting of the Senate and Sejm, a
low stirring rose up in the rear of the chamber.
   Soon the hall was filled with the melody of ``Sto Lat,'' a
traditional Polish song that is the local variant of ``For He's A
Jolly Good Fellow.''
   The strains grew louder as the song drew to a close, with even
Jaruzelski appearing to join in for the last refrain.
   The song goes:
   ``A hundred years, a hundred years,
   ``Let him live, live for us.
   ``Once again, once again
   ``Let him live for us.''
   Bush nodded in acknowledgement of the melody before delivering a
speech promising Poland a $100 million aid package.

   Feuding between roadcrews of two pop bands
erupted into a brawl that left one man dead and another in serious
condition today.
   The fighting culminated before a concert could begin here Sunday
when roadcrew members for New Edition and Guy battled with baseball
bats, microphones and other weapons, authorities said.
   The stagehands were setting up for the Budweiser Superfest
concert at the Civic Arena, police said. Five men ended up in jail,
one in the hospital and one dead. The concert was canceled.
   Crewmembers for the same groups got into a fistfight on stage
during a performance Saturday night in Greensboro, N.C.,
interrupting the concert for nearly an hour while a near sellout
crowd looked on and jeered.
   Commander Ronald Freeman of the Pittsburg police said the feud
started when Guy played beyond its time limit. When members of New
Edition came on stage, one of the members of Guy kicked or pushed
some of equipment belonging to New Edition.
   Anthony Bee, 32, of New York City, road security manager for Guy,
died Sunday of gunshot wounds to the chest and shoulders, according
to Mercy Hospital spokesman Eric Hofmann.
   New Edition's production manager, Ronald Byrd, 30, of Buffalo,
N.Y., was jailed on a criminal homicide charge and a firearms
violation in connection with Bee's death.
   Police also arrested Michael Floyd, Jean Griffith, Ronald Thomas
and Vincent Rosario, all of New York City. They were charged with
aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy in the beating of Michael
Clark, also of New York.
   Clark, a crew worker for New Edition, was listed in serious
condition this morning in Allegheny General Hospital.
   Police said Bee was shot in the back by a man who chased him out
of the arena and across the street into a hotel.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in 50 years the government is
producing accurate maps of the capital, the official Tass news
agency said today.
   In the past, maps of the city were deliberately distorted and
among ``the manifestations of the policy of secrecy which quite
often covered up lawlessness and arbitrariness,'' Tass said.
   As a result, Tass said, maps failed to be adequate guides both
for tourists and Muscovites.
   A familiar saying among Soviets that is often passed on to
foreigners is: ``If you don't know where you are, you don't belong
there.''
   But the new map of Moscow, ``prepared by the main board of
Geodesy and Cartography on the strength of a topographic survey of
the city, represents Moscow as it is in actual fact for the first
time in half a century,'' Tass said.
   The news agency said there are more than 3,100 avenues, squares,
streets and lanes in Moscow. ``Every street of the city is shown on
the new map and its name is listed in a supplement which is
published as a separate booklet,'' Tass said.
   It did not say where or when the map would be made available to
the public.

   A bombing and an attack on a nonunion
mine early today marred the start of a cooling-off period called by
the head of the United Mine Workers union in an effort to ease
tensions in a wildcat walkout.
   About 150 people, some wearing masks and camouflage paint on
their faces, appeared at the entrance to the Appalachian Mining Inc.
mine at Boomer, southeast of Charleston, overturning two trucks and
a car and injuring several security personnel, said Cliff Nuckols.
   ``They sneaked through the weeds. You can't see them. They come
through the weeds and the woods and all of a sudden you're just
looking at them,'' said Nuckols, head of Cincinnati-based Nuckols
and Associates Security Inc., which handles security at the mine.
   He said shots were fired from a picket line outside the mine.
Security personnel fired no shots. Nuckols said the workers'
injuries were minor. He said he didn't know who the attackers were.
   At Castlewood, Va., two bombs exploded early today, one damaging
a Pittston Coal Group Inc. office trailer and another going off on a
private yard, state police reported. No injuries were caused and no
one was arrested, Virginia state police Sgt. Mike Frank said.
   A woman who answered the phone at UMW District 17 headquarters in
Charleston said union officials were unavailable for comment this
morning.
   More than 37,000 miners have been on industry-wide wildcat
walkouts since June 12 in eight states, protesting Pittston's
refusal to sign a national contract negotiated by the UMW and other
companies that are members of the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association.
   Pittston's miners, without a contract since Feb. 1, 1988, have
been on strike since April 5.
   Miners say the wildcat strikes are being staged because Pittston
is not dealing fairly with the union. Pittston officials have denied
that.
   The violence came three days after UMW President Richard Trumka
called for all UMW members east of the Mississippi River to stay
away from work for a three-day memorial period in an attempt to
``calm the volatile situation in the coal fields.''
   Trumka was to join U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Gary
White, head of the West Virginia Coal Operators Association, in New
York today for talks with the head of Japan's Nippon Steel. Nippon
is the world's largest steelmaker and uses West Virginia coal.
   In an interview with the (Charleston) Sunday Gazette-Mail, Trumka
said he sees no quick solution for the Pittston strike, which has
idled 1,900 miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky.
   Trumka also told the newspaper he wouldn't be surprised if he's
jailed for his part in the labor action.
   Three union leaders were jailed for a time in Virginia for
encouraging miners and their supporters to block Pittston's coal
production through acts of civil disobedience.
   Trumka said court orders for the UMW to end sit-down
demonstrations against Pittston _ and fines that double every time
the union is found in violation _ are an ``economic death warrant.''

   Homer E. Williams caused quite a stir
when he visited his attorneys' office after they had sworn in court
he was dead.
   ``I said, `Feel me. I'm warm,''' said Williams, who left town on
a fishing trip in February and came home to find he'd been declared
legally dead, with his will opened in probate court.
   He said he also asked his attorneys if they'd have to shoot him,
``to keep from messing up their files. But they said they'd get it
worked out.''
   And so they did. Williams, 63, was declared legally alive Friday
by Vanderburgh Superior Court Judge Robert Lensing.
   Williams' ``death,'' it turns out, was a case of mistaken
identity.
   During Williams' trip to Alabama in February, a 93-year-old man
with the same name and middle initial died in Evansville. According
to court documents, someone at the law firm of Lacey, Terrell,
Annakin, Heldt &amp; Baugh noticed the obituary in The Evansville
Courier and, as the law firm representing Williams, promptly filed
his will for probate and had him declared dead.
   Meanwhile, their client was fishing in Alabama and his wife was
out of town in Illinois.
   The firm sent the widow a letter of condolence, which Williams
opened when he returned about 10 days later.
   ``I thought it was hilarious. My wife said I'd better go talk to
the lawyers,'' he said.
   Williams didn't get around to it until May 18, then the law firm
filed its papers and the court acted Friday by resealing the will
and revoking the probate, calling Williams ``the alleged decedent.''

   Fifteen South Pacific nations alarmed at
the depletion of tuna stocks by drift net fishing today asked help
to force Japan and Taiwan to end the practice known as the ``wall of
death.''
   In Spain, fishermen and Greenpeace activists today tried to block
the port of Cartagena to protest the government's failure to stop
the illegal use of driftnets in the Mediterranean, the environmental
group said.
   The Pacific leaders are alarmed that drift net fishing, also
called gill net fishing, is ravaging fish stocks and threatening the
Pacific's economic future, said Cook Islands Prime Minister Geoffrey
Henry.
   Henry, briefing reporters after the opening session of two-day
annual conference of the South Pacific Forum on this South Pacific
island, said the Pacific island nations back an Australian proposal
for an international convention banning driftnet fishing.
   The technique uses nets up to 30 miles long and 50 feet deep,
which are set adrift by fishing boats for later collection. It has
been likened to strip mining of the ocean.
   The method is designed to catch albacore tuna by their gills in
the net's fine mesh. But fish researchers say it also catches vast
numbers of dolphins, whales, seals, turtles and squid.
   With stocks of Southern Pacific Albacore tuna estimated to be
exhausted in two years, Henry said the Pacific leaders found that
urgent action is needed.
   Henry said the Pacific Forum leaders particularly objected to
what he called Japan's intransigence ``in refusing to end drift net
fishing.''
   Henry said the conference will increase surveillance of their
200-mile economic zones to prevent the fishing method.
   The South Pacific Forum also includes the Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea,
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.
   In Cartagena, a Greenpeace communique said its flagship, the
Sirius, and 40 Spanish fishing vessels crowded into the harbor as a
protest. Spanish navy and port authorities said they were not
authorized to comment on the situation.
   The London-based environmental organization said between 30 and
40 Spanish-registered boats operating out of southern Spanish ports
use driftnets even though they are illegal in Spain.
   The communique said commercial fisherman have noticed large drops
in their catches since the nets came into use two years ago.

   Security was tightened over the weekend at Fort
Amador, in Panama, after a bullet from an AK-47 rifle struck the
bedroom of the child of a U.S. Army colonel, the Pentagon said today.
   No one was injured in the incident Saturday, in which the bullet
entered the home of Col. Jorge Torres, the commander of the U.S.
Army Southern Command's signal brigade, the Pentagon said.
   Military police investigators on the scene said the bullet
``apparently came from the vicinity of the PDF (Panama Defense
Forces) compound'' in nearby Chorillo, according to a statement
issued by the Southern Command and relayed by Pentagon officials.
   The colonel and his wife ``were visibly shaken'' by the early
morning shot, which landed in the center of their son's room, the
statement said.
   The bullet came through a second-story window, penetrated an
interior wooden door and dropped to the floor less than a foot from
the child's bed, the statement said.
   U.S. authorities protested the incident to senior Panamanian
Defense officials, the statement said.
   Fort Amador, a facility jointly used by U.S. and Panamanian
military forces, is located near Balboa in the Panama Canal area.

   Labor Party leaders recommended today their
party quit the governing coalition to protest the Likud bloc's
tougher conditions for peace talks with the Palestinians.
   The move could bring down the government and, eight months after
the last national elections, force a new vote.
   Labor leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres told his
left-leaning party's 120-member leadership bureau that he wants to
convene Labor's governing Central Committee ``as soon as possible''
and to ask it to endorse the move.
   The bureau's recommendations usually are endorsed by the Central
Committee.
   Last week, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc
met and toughened its conditions for elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip in which Palestinians would choose leaders to
negotiate limited self-rule with Israel.
   The hardened position has drawn fire from Washington and the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Egypt told the United States on
Sunday that Shamir's peace plan would escalate the tension and
violence in the occupied territories.
   Peres proposed sending a letter to Shamir saying the Likud stance
``seriously harmed the government's peace initiative'' and that his
party has concluded it would be proper to ``dismantle the present
government.''
   Peres said Shamir's speech at last week's Likud forum ``gave in
to the opinions and positions of those who oppose the agreed
initiative, those who want to torpedo it.''
   The Labor leadership bureau, which includes the party's
lawmakers, approved Peres' proposal by a 45-2 vote. Six bureau
members abstained and many others did not return to the session for
the vote, some saying they stayed away because they oppose leaving
the government.
   Shamir's top aide Yossi Ahimeir told The Associated Press the
prime minister was still ``hopeful that the bottom line would not be
a (Labor) withdrawal.''
   ``There is no place for dismantling the government. This is not
in Israel's interests. This is not in the interests of peace. Such a
move only means a delay in the peace process,'' he said.
   In May, the coalition Cabinet had endorsed the peace initiative
for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On Wednesday, however, Likud hawks led by Trade Minister Ariel
Sharon forced Shamir to adopt the conditions that critics said would
end chances of Palestinian acceptance.
   Under Likud's new conditions, no elections would be held in the
occupied lands until the end of the Palestinian uprising, which in
its 19 months has claimed the lives of more than 550 Palestinians
and 33 Israelis.
   Likud's new conditions also specify that a program of building
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories will go forward. The
United States has called the settlements obstacles to peace.
   In addition, Shamir ruled out a key Palestinian demand that
140,000 Arabs living in the annexed east Jerusalem be allowed to
participate in the balloting.
   Likud also reiterated its opposition to the creation of a
Palestinian state, a goal of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said the new conditions make the
election plan unacceptable.
   ``The Likud decision means a deadly blow to elections no matter
what cosmetic fixes they try to put on it now,'' The New York Times
quoted him as saying Sunday in Tunisia.
   Arafat said the United States shared much of the blame for
Israel's new conditions. And he hinted at ending PLO-U.S.
discussions, saying they had accomplished little since they began
last year.
   Shamir maintains the principles voted by Likud on Wednesday do
not affect the peace plan, but Secretary of State James A. Baker III
has criticized the party's action as ``not helpful'' to the peace
process.
   Israel Television reported Sunday that high-ranking U.S.
officials were urging Labor not to leave the government.
   A high-ranking State Department delegation plans to visit Israel
in 10 days to discuss the future of the government's proposal for
elections in the occupied lands.

   An explosion ripped through the first floor
of City Hall today, killing three people and wounding four, official
radio said.
   The bombing came hours after up to 15,000 people staged a nearby
rally to protest military rule, Western diplomats said.
   The bomb apparently exploded when a 50-year-old city employee
opened a cupboard in a recreation room near the main entrance of the
building, Rangoon Radio reported.
   The employee, a co-worker and a 12-year-old youth were killed in
the blast, the radio said. Four others, including a policeman and a
fenale employee were wounded, it said.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing and no one had
been arrested, the radio said.
   Officials said they suspected the bomb was a plastic explosive
device similiar to one that exploded Friday at the Syriam oil
refinery, killing two people.
   City Hall is a key adminsitrative building in the capital, which
has been under martial law since the military crushed a nationwide
uprising for democracy in September.
   A Western diplomat, interviewed by telephone from Bangkok,
Thailand, said the blast ``could have been deliberate, or it may
have been a military accident.''
   The nearby protest rally and the bombing ``were about eight hours
apart and there is no indication of any connection,'' said the
diplomat on condition of anonymity.
   Western diplomats said the protesters today rallied in support of
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who continued a campaign of
speeches denouncing military rule.
   Rangoon-based diplomats said today's political rally was the
biggest since the military crushed anti-government dissent in
September.
   The rally was held just north of Sule Pagoda, a Buddhist temple
in the center of the city.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has drawn large crowds in Rangoon recently that have
gathered in defiance of martial law regulations forbidding
gatherings of more than five people.
   The official and diplomatic sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, addressing the crowd from the offices of the largest
student-led political party, the Democratic Party for New Society,
continued her criticism of former socialist strongman Ne Win and
repeated calls for talks with Gen Saw Maung's ruling military
council.
   The charismatic Ms. Suu Kyi, 44-year old daughter of assassinated
independence hero Aung San, has drawn widespread support since
emerging at the head of last year's thwarted uprising for democracy.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has continued to give speeches in spite of warnings
by the government that the opposition leader end what they describe
as her ``confrontational'' approach in politics.
   Ne Win, who held Burma in an iron grip for 26 years until
officially retiring a year ago, has been the main target for Ms. Suu
Kyi's attacks. Her condemnations are unprecedented in a country
cowed by years of repression.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, general secretary of the National League for
Democracy, charges Ne Win continues to manipulate the government of
Gen. Saw Maung from the wings.
   Ne Win, now 78, is held responsible for ordering the massacre of
protestors during protests for political change last year. Troops
under Saw Maung killed at least hundreds when assuming power Sept.
18.
   Saw Maung insisted Ne Win has no part in national politics.

   President Bush today became the first
American leader to address the Polish National Assembly, the
communist world's only parliament with a freely elected opposition
party.
   Nearly half the legislators are supporters of the independent
Solidarity trade union movement who were seated July 4 following the
East bloc's freest elections in four decades.
   The National Assembly is the result of unprecedented April
accords reached by communist authorities and the Solidarity-led
opposition. The agreement created a Senate, which combined with the
existing Sejm, or parliament, to form the National Assembly.
   The pact, which lifted a seven-year ban on Solidarity, allowed
independent candidates to contest all 100 Senate seats and 161
places in the 460-seat Sejm.
   Solidarity swept 99 of the Senate seats and 161 places in the
Sejm in June's two-stage vote.
   Already there is a new style at the white building on a bluff
above the Vistula River. Opposition deputies have electrified the
once sleepy Sejm with harsh attacks on government policy.
   Sejm deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who doubles as national
spokesman for Solidarity, often rides his bike to parliament. Deputy
Adam Michnik, editor of the opposition daily Gazeta Wyborcza, so far
has declined to discard his blue jeans.
   Seating for the Bush speech was tight because the main chamber
was designed to accommodate only the Sejm.
   But the large wooden chair for the president of Poland, a new
post created by the April accords, was empty. Authorities had hoped
to have the president elected in time for the Bush visit, but the
failure of the Communist Party to designate a candidate delayed the
vote by the joint Sejm and Senate.
   Poles aren't quite used to the name National Assembly and the
building is still commonly referred to as the Sejm, a word first
used in the Middle Ages.
   In Polish, the word sejm means assembly or council. Founded on
the basis of local sejms, Poland's first national bicameral Sejm was
convened in 1493.
   In contrast to much of Europe, which was ruled by hereditary
royalty, Poland had an elected king chosen by the Sejm, which
consisted of nobles. The Sejm was able to check the king's power
with its right to veto proposals.
   But Poland's democracy ended when the crowns of Austria, Prussia
and Russia partitioned the country among themselves in 1795.
   The first modern Sejm convened in 1919, after Poland reappeared
on the map of Europe following Germany's defeat in World War I.
Parliament met in a girls' school until a proper home could be built
in 1928.
   The 1939 Nazi and Soviet invasions of Poland smothered the
country's democratic revival. The Sejm was razed during the war,
like much of the capital.
   Democratic elections were agreed upon in principle by the allied
powers at the end of World War II, when the Soviet Red Army occupied
Poland.
   The 1947 elections were denounced in the West as a sham but the
results left communists firmly in control of parliament and the
party then rewrote the laws to preclude any real political
opposition.
   The National Assembly sworn in July 4 is the first with
opposition representation in Eastern Europe since the late 1940s.
   Under the agreement negotiaed by the communist government and the
opposition, the Sejm initiates legislation and the Senate holds veto
power.
   The Sejm can override a Senate veto only with a two-thirds
majority, a margin the communist coalition lacks. Therefore, all
legislation will require approval of Solidarity-backed lawmakers.

   Winnie Mandela met today with her
husband, jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, who has not
been heard from since his meeting last week with President P.W.
Botha.
   After a one-hour visit, Mrs. Mandela declined to answer
questions, saying she first would talk to anti-apartheid leaders in
Johannesburg.
   ``I'm afraid we have instructions from the (black) community
leaders to go and report back to them before we are able to answer
questions,'' she told reporters at the gates of Victer Verster
Prison in Paarl outside Cape Town.
   Mrs. Mandela said she planned to meet with the Rev. Frank
Chikane, a family friend, but gave no indication of when a statement
would be released.
   Chikane on Sunday described the Botha-Mandela meeting as an act
of ``political mischief'' intended to ``sow confusion in the minds
of black people and the outside world.''
   But other anti-apartheid activists and commentators on various
sides of the country's racial issues praised the event.
   The independent Cape Times newspaper said the encounter had
``huge symbolic significance, foreshadowing Mr. Mandela's release
and, ultimately, serious negotiation to resolve the South African
crisis.''
   The white-led government's announcement Saturday that Botha and
the leader of the outlawed African National Congress had met took
the Mandela family and the anti-apartheid movement by surprise.
   ``The feeling is that it is of vital importance that Mrs. Mandela
meets Mandela personally, so she does not hear first from the press
what is happening,'' said Chikane, secretary-general of the South
African Council of Churches.
   He said Mrs. Mandela flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town to visit
her husband at a prison farm at Paarl.
   Chikane said Mrs. Mandela already had planned to see her husband
and that this was a ``normal visit.'' Her last visit was three weeks
ago.
   Mandela, 70, was transferred in December from Pollsmoor prison at
Cape Town to Victor Verster prison farm, where the conditions of his
imprisonment were eased and he was allowed to stay alone in a prison
warder's house.
   He was jailed in 1962 and two years later began a life sentence
on conviction of plotting to overthrow the government.
   Botha, who is to step down after elections in September, and
other members of his dominant National Party have hinted in recent
months that they would like to find an acceptable formula to release
Mandela.
   Botha has suggested that the government could modify its demand
that Mandela make an outright renunciation of violence before his
release.
   Mandela retains wide popularity among blacks. The exiled African
National Congress guerrilla movement, as well as anti-apartheid
black groups within South Africa, have said Mandela's freedom is a
condition for negotiations with the government.
   Botha and Mandela met for 45 minutes on Wednesday at Botha's
official residence in Cape Town. The first known meeting between the
two increased speculation that Botha may free Mandela before leaving
office.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee attended the meeting and said
later the two men confirmed ``their support for peaceful development
in South Africa.''
   But Chikane, at a Sunday news conference at Mrs. Mandela's home,
said the Botha-Mandela meeting took place ``in the context of a
prisoner and his captors.
   ``For Mrs. Mandela or any of our leaders to be able to contribute
meaningfully to the search for peace in this country, they must
first be given the opportunity to be in contact with the masses they
represent,'' Chikane said.
   Mrs. Mandela let Chikane speak for her during the Sunday news
conference, answering only one question, about whether she thought
the meeting meant Mandela would be freed soon.
   ``We haven't the slightest idea. It is impossible to analyze the
present indications,'' she said.
   Leaders of major anti-apartheid groups ostracized Mrs. Mandela in
February because of what they called a ``reign of terror'' by her
bodyguards in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg. Since
then she has made few appearances.
   Other anti-apartheid activists welcomed the meeting. Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Botha ``was heeding the calls of those
who are interested in negotiations.'' Foreign Minister R.F. Botha,
no relation to the president, said the meeting would benefit all
South Africans.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Over the objections of her lawyer, a
21-year-old woman pleaded guilty today to drowning and dismembering
her 7-week-old son last January and dumping the parts in two
Pennsylvania creeks.
   Tanya Dacri, whose husband, Phillip, previously pleaded guilty to
helping her dispose of the remains of their son, Zacharry, stood
quietly before Common Pleas Judge Michael Stiles and told him she
wanted to admit the crime.
   She added that she knew what she was doing in making the plea.
   Her lawyer, Samuel Stretton, acknowledged that his client
``understands the consequences and the nature of the charges and the
doctors I had examine her say she is legally competent.''
   He also told Stiles that he had advised Mrs. Dacri to plead
innocent so he could raise the defense of innocent by reason of
insanity.
   Police have said Mrs. Dacri told officers after her arrest that
she killed her son last Jan. 7 because she couldn't stand his
constant crying.
   Mrs. Dacri pleaded guilty to a general charge of murder, which
allows the judge to determine the degree. She also pleaded guilty to
possession of an instrument of a crime, abuse of a corpse,
obstruction of justice, hindering prosecution, tampering with public
records, providing false information to authorities, and conspiracy.
   Among those in the small City Hall courtroom were her parents,
other relatives and friends, and her 22-year-old husband, who is
scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 18 for his part in the case
   She turned and smiled at him before she turned her back and faced
the bench.
   Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron wanted Phillip Dacri
excluded from the courtroom on grounds he might be a witness at the
hearing, following the guilty plea, on the degree of murder
liability. But he was allowed to stay.
   Mrs. Dacri spoke in a voice almost inaudible in the tiny
courtroom, nodding her head when the judge asked her if she
understood the crimes to which she was pleading guilty.
   She acknowledged during questioning by the judge that she was
pleading guilty of her own free will.
   Asked what he thought of her action, Stretton said, ``I am
satisfied that she is legally competent to make the decision, but it
is against my advice. I think her decision is a result of her mental
illness.''

   The new military rulers have released two
prominent editors detained by the ousted civilian government,
sources said today, a day after the junta formed a new Cabinet
pledged to halting the southern civil war.
   A source at the banned Sudanese Journalists' Union identified the
freed men as Sidahmed al-Khalifa, editor and publisher of Al-Watan
tri-weekly, and Mohammed Medani Tewfik, editor and publisher of the
weekly Al-Rai.
   The publications are among about 50 privately owned newspapers
and magazines shut down by the soldiers who overthrew Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi in a bloodless coup on June 30.
   Al-Khalifa was arrested for publishing an interview with former
President Gaafar Nimeiri, the military dictator overthrown in a 1985
coup who was a foe of el-Mahdi's government.
   Tewfik was detained for publishing news of military operations,
violating a ban on news reports of the fighting against rebels in
the south.
   Also today, Sudan's new leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed
el-Bashir, was quoted as saying southern Sudanese in his 15-member
Salvation Revolution Council can help negotiate an end to the war.
   The Kuwait daily Al-Anbaa also quoted el-Bashir as reiterating in
an interview in Khartoum that he does not believe Sudan is ready for
multiparty democracy, and that the ruling council will consider ways
of ``involving the public in governing the country to the exclusion
of any parties or sectarianism.''
   El-Bashir was quoted as saying the armed forces ``understand the
viewpoint of the people's movement (the rebels),'' but that peace
talks can be held only without conditions.
   ``We have just to sit at the negotiating table,'' he told
Al-Anbaa.
   Rebel officials have contacted junta members in Khartoum in the
past two days to inquire about proposed peace initiatives, he said.
   They include a one-month armistice and an amnesty for all who
fought the government for political reasons since 1983, when the
rebellion began.
   An estimated 50,000 rebels are fighting for more autonomy in the
mainly Christian and animist south from a government dominated by
the majority Moslems.

   A teen-ager who was impaled on an iron spike
while climbing a fence for a fly ball remained stoic during the 90
minutes he was stuck there, his brother said.
   Julio Castillo, 15, was in guarded but stable condition today,
according to officials at the City Hospital Center. The boy's major
injuries were to his lower jaw and teeth.
   The ghastly accident occurred Saturday as Castillo tried to climb
a 6-foot, wrought-iron fence to retrieve a ball. He slipped and a
square spike, about an inch wide, entered his neck and came out of
his mouth.
   ``The doctors told my mother that the spear came very close the
the jugular vein. It was a matter of millimeters,'' said Gabriel
Castillo, Julio's 26-year-old brother. ``Otherwise he would be
dead.''
   The accident occurred outside Castillo's apartment building in
the borough of Queens.
   ``He was out in left field. Somebody hit the ball and he went to
get it,'' said 8-year-old Alex Castillo, another brother. ``He
climbed the fence to try to catch it and then, just as he reached
up, he slipped. ...
   ``There was a lot of blood, but he didn't cry.''
   Paramedics arrived within five minutes of the accident. They tied
Julio to the fence to keep his weight from making the wound larger
or possibly fracturing his neck, said Firefighter Peter Cozeolino.
   Rescuers had to cut away a 4{-by-6{-foot section of the fence and
carry the boy to the hospital on it.
   At the hospital, firefighters scrubbed, put on gloves and went
into the emergency room. There, they used an electric hacksaw to cut
away most of the spike.
   A fire hose was placed across the boy's chest to protect him from
the saw blade.
   ``We were within half an inch'' of his chest, said Cozeolino.
``But you didn't have a choice. You were just thinking about being
careful.''
   Water was poured over the spike so it didn't get hot from the
sawing and burn the youngster.
   ``He was petrified, but he was pretty brave,'' Cozeolino said.
   ``He knew he really didn't have a choice.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush today proposed a $100
million aid package and promised to seek new loans and debt relief
for Poland, declaring that the Communist nation's moves toward
democratic freedoms ``show the way toward a new era throughout
Europe.''
   In the first address by an American president before the Polish
parliament, Bush hailed recent political and economic reforms and
said, ``This generation's calling is to redeem the promise of a free
Polish republic. Poland has not been lost so long as the Polish
spirit lives.''
   The Polish deputies interrupted Bush's speech five times with
polite applause, but gave him a standing ovation at the end.
   The speech was the dramatic high point of the first day of the
president's 10-day European tour, which included 2 hours and 40
minutes of talks with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Bush was cheered by about 4,000 flag-waving, chanting Poles who
shouted ``Long Live, Long Live'' when he attended wreath-laying
ceremonies at memorials to Polish war dead and the Jewish victims of
the Nazi Holocaust during World War II.
   At a luncheon, the president urged Polish Communist leaders and
representatives of the once-banned Solidarity trade union movement
to ``rise above the mistrust to bring the Polish people together for
a common purpose.''
   In view of Poland's $39 billion foreign debt and other economic
woes, Bush's aid proposals seemed modest.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III said afterwards, ``No
one that we've met with so far has intimated that they expected the
president of the United States to show up here with a big
wheelbarrow full of dollars,''
   Baker also brushed off suggestions that Bush was attracting
relatively small crowds, numbering only in the low thousands. ``It's
not some election campaign . ... '' said Baker. ``We're pleased by
what we see as a rather spontaneous outpouring of support.''
   Bush, in his parliamentary speech, said, ``The reform of the
Polish economy will be an historic challenge. There can be no
substitute for Poland's own efforts.''
   Warning that Poland must accept austerity measures, the president
said: ``I must speak honestly: economic reform and recovery cannot
occur without sacrifices.''
   Taking the rostrum before Bush spoke, Jaruzelski said Poland is
embarked on ``one grand collective experiment'' that will require
internal sacrifices.
   ``We are fully aware that the biggest work is up to us
ourselves,'' the Communist Party chief said. ``But we do not wish to
be alone. We have many friends. I am certain that Polish-American
relations, that our cooperation, shall also serve as confirmation of
that.''
   The six-point aid package announced by Bush included these
provisions:
   _A request to Congress for a $100 million ``enterprise fund'' to
support private entrepreneurs in Poland. Bush said he will ask other
industrial democracies at the economic summit in Paris this weekend
to establish similar funds.
   _A proposal for the seven summit nations to intensify their
cooperation in promoting democratic reforms in Poland and Hungary.
He offered to work with the other summit nations to boost Western
aid and technical assistance.
   _A promise to establish a U.S. center in Warsaw to conduct
educational and cultural programs. He said he would ask Poland to
establish a similar center in America.
   _A plea for the World Bank to move ahead with $325 million in
loans to help Polish agriculture and industry improve productivity.
   _A request for Western debtor nations to support ``an early and
generous'' rescheduling of Polish debt. Bush said such a step could
amount to deferral of about $5 billion in payments this year if
Western nations agreed to liberalized terms.
   _A request to Congress for $15 million for a cooperative effort
with Poland to fight air and water pollution threatening the
historic city of Krakow.
   ``The road ahead is a long one, but it is the only road which
leads to prosperity and social peace,'' Bush said. ``Poland's
progress along this road will show the way toward a new era
throughout Europe, an era based on common values and not just
geographic proximity.''
   He pledged that Western democracies ``will stand with the Polish
people and other peoples of this region.''
   Running throughout Bush's speech was a theme of encouragement for
the dramatic political transformations taking place in Poland.
   Pointing to Poland's difficult history, Bush said:
   ``You have been a crucible of conflict. You are now becoming a
vessel for change.
   ``Poland is where the Cold War began and now the people of Poland
can help bring the division of Europe to an end. The time has come
to move beyond containment to a world too long deferred, a better
world.''
   Bush held out hope that changes under way in Poland and Hungary
would spread beyond their borders to the rest of Eastern Europe.
   ``By creating political structures legitimized by popular will,
your reforms can be the foundations of stability, security and
prosperity _ not just here, but in all of Europe, now and into the
next century,'' he said.
   Bush quoted Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as saying it is
the sovereign right of nations to ``choose either capitalism or
socialism.''
   Bush added, ``In principle, I agree. But I might have said that
the people of a nation may freely choose either a free-market
economy or socialism. That is their right.''
   He emphasized that the goal of the West was ``not to disrupt, not
to interfere, not to threaten any nation's security, but to help
forge closer and enduring ties between Poland and the rest of
Europe.''
   He also praised Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the Roman
Catholic Church, which has played a key role in pressing for reform.
   The extent of Poland's democratic reforms were underscored by the
fact that the country boasts the only parliament in the Communist
world with a freely elected opposition party.
   Earlier in the day, Bush told luncheon guests that ``the United
States will stand with Poland. We will support Poland's hopeful
mission, unparalleled in your history.''
   The Bush talks with Jaruzelski dealt with the U.S. aid package
and the political changes sweeping Poland.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Jaruzelski
talked at length about the political situation in Poland. He said
Bush ``reiterated the United States' desire to be helpful in
Poland's reform efforts without being intrusive.''
   Fitzwater said the president thought the meeting was ``quite
productive and friendly.''
   From their formal talks, Bush and Jaruzelski went to a luncheon
with about 80 other guests, including government and Solidarity
leaders, at the residence of U.S. Ambassador John Davis. Jaruzelski
told the president he appreciated the opportunity to ``better come
to know each other and understand each other.''
   As Bush and Jaruzelski began their discussions, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Polish Foreign Minister Tadeusz
Olechowski signed agreements providing further delays in payments on
about $1 billion in debts owed to the United States. The accords
granting a five-year grace period extended agreements reached in
1985 and 1986.
   The official news agency PAP quotes Olechowski as saying after
the Bush-Jaruzelski meeting: ``We are not counting on a rain of gold
but on more favorable conditions of agreements with the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and also on help in
restructuring our debt with the Paris Club.''
   Bush told reporters his morning visit to the two monuments had a
``very profound'' effect on him. Before he left the Jewish memorial,
the president crossed the street and shook hands with spectators.
``Good luck to all of you,'' he told them.
   About 2,000 people, including Poles and American tourists, turned
out to greet Bush at a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.
   Poles shouted ``long live, long live'' and ``100 years, 100
years'' as Bush stepped out of his armored limousine.
   Bush's visit to Poland is the first stop on a 10-day trip that
will include a meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Gdansk
and the first-ever visit by an American president to Hungary.
   He also will travel to Paris for a seven-nation economic summit
and stop briefly in the Netherlands.

   A bull gored two men Monday, the fourth
day of the weeklong San Fermin Festival, and 45 others suffered cuts
and bruises.
   The bulls of the Andalucian ranch of Salvador Guardiola ran the
half mile to the bull ring in 2 minutes, 45 seconds as an estimated
1,000 runners ran with them.
   Spaniards Joaquin Haya and Miguel Martin were gored and underwent
surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said. Haya, 34, suffered a chest
injury and Martin, 28, was injured in the thigh.
   The rest of the injured were treated for bruises and cuts at
several Red Cross posts.
   Ernest Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises'' described in
detail the rowdy festival that starts each morning with the running
of the bulls.
   The festival began July 6 and ends Friday.
   On each day of the festival, six bulls run to the bull ring,
where they are killed by professional bullfighters.
   Since 1591, bulls have gored 52 people to death, according to
city records.

   Chris Darwin, great-great-grandson of
naturalist Charles Darwin, says the high point of his career was
dining out at 22,205 feet atop a mountain in Peru.
   Darwin, who specializes in staging gastromic events in unusual
places to raise money for charity, returned to his Sydney home
Monday to bring word and pictures of his latest black tie social
climb.
   ``Eating is the only thing we are good at, so we staged the
world's highest dinner party,'' said Darwin, 28.
   Darwin, who produces TV commercials, heads a group called Social
Climbers to raise money for the Heart Foundation. His latest
adventure ended June 28 feasting in top hats and tails on the peak
of Mount Huascaran.
   Lightweight versions of Louis XIV furniture, candelabra, silver
cutlery and top quality crystal were hauled up the mountain for the
banquet of chicken breast, smoked trout, vegetables, red wine and
champagne.
   The team of nine spent nine days climbing, braving avalanches,
sub-zero temperatures and ferocious winds.
   Despite their thermal underwear, Darwin said two members of the
group suffered hypothermia.
   ``The weather was horrific, I don't think we really knew what we
were up against,'' he said.
   Darwin said the climb raised $20,000 for the Heart Foundation.
   ``We had the highest and quickest dinner party and achieved the
longest distance for a champagne cork when opened,'' Darwin said.
   ``Anyone can throw a dinner party but not the way we do it,'' he
said. ``Atmosphere is what makes a good dinner party.''
   The Social Climbers formed 18 months ago. One of their feats was
dining at a table suspended over a cliff in Sydney harbor.

   President Bush faced today what be the
biggest hurdle on his trip to Poland: trying to get through those
multi-syllabic Polish names without stumbling.
   He didn't quite make it, but he made a good try.
   At the beginning of his speech to parliament, Bush paid greetings
to Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, Sejm speaker Mikolaj
Kozakiewicz, Senate speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski and Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   He did a passable job on Jaruzelski and Kozakiewicz, but the
others were a muddle.
   What should have been pronounced Stel-ma-HOV-ski came out
``Stal-ma-CHOW-ski'' and Ra-KOFF-ski came out ``Ra-KOW-ski.''
   If he felt self-conscious about the task, Bush could take comfort
from the fact that Poles have trouble saying his name, too.
   It usually comes out ``Boosh.''
   Jaruzelski, by the way, is pronounced Yah-ruh-ZEL-ski, and
Kozakiewicz is Ko-za-KIEH-vich.

<HEAD>Congress Weighs Protection for Artists' Work After Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mowry Baden spent more than a year creating
``Wild Celery for Stephen Davis,'' an abstract steel sculpture
nestled among wildflowers and eucalyptus trees at the University of
California at Irvine.
   Eight years later, the sculpture was razed, a casualty of
university expansion.
   ``I was devastated,'' said the Canadian artist, who had dedicated
the maze of 60-foot steel ramps to a friend and colleague. ``It's
like having your arm cut off.''
   In most states, Baden would have received little more than
sympathy since the school had paid him for the work. But Baden filed
suit under a 1980 California law, the first of its kind in the
United States that gives artists the right to protect their works
from destruction and alteration after the sale.
   This year, Congress may be ready to follow the lead of California
and eight other states and establish similar protections for artists
nationwide. Opposition from auction houses, movie studios and others
largely has been removed through a series of legislative compromises.
   The concept that artists retain rights even after their works are
sold, that art works remain the ``intellectual property'' of their
creators, is derived from French law. The American tradition of
treating art as ``pure property,'' no different from an automobile
or a pair of shoes, was inherited from British law, said Mark
Fischer, a Boston attorney who has brought cases under
Massachusetts' artist protection statute.
   ``If you bought a painting under the French tradition, you
couldn't destroy it because you carry part of the artists'
personality with it,'' Fischer said. ``Under the English law ... you
(could buy) a Renoir and paint it red.''
   A 1986 scheme by an Australian mail order firm in which Picasso's
linocut, ``Trois Femmes,'' was sliced into one-inch squares and sold
for $135 each is the best known _ but by no means only _ case of
deliberate art destruction.
   Lesser-known cases are vilified with equal fury by the art world:
a painting covered with profanities and sliced up by the artist's
ex-girlfriend, a set of sculptures carved with crosses by owners who
thought the works were possessed with evil; Baden's ``Wild Celery,''
which construction crews mistook for scrap metal.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., have taken the debate over artists' rights to Capitol Hill.
   ``A work of art is not a utilitarian object, like a toaster; it
is a creative work, like a song, a poem or a novel,'' said Markey.
``We should not pretend that all connection between the artist and
the creation is severed the first time the work is sold.''
   This year's version of the Visual Artists' Rights Act is narrower
and less controversial than unsuccessful attempts of past years.
   Under the measure, artists would be given the right to bring a
civil copyright suit against art owners for the ``distortion,
mutilation or other modification'' of paintings, drawings,
sculptures and limited edition prints and photographs.
   The proposed law pointedly excludes films and books, somewhat
easing anxiety in the motion picture and book publishing industries.
   Both groups have said they will not oppose the revised
legislation, although they remain apprehensive over whether the bill
will be seen as a prelude to federal bans on the colorization of
black-and-white film classics and on other commercial activities.
   The revised legislation also eliminates part of the original bill
that would have allowed artists to collect a 7 percent royalty on
high-profit works that are resold from one collector to another.
   Advocates argued that it was unfair for the creators of
sculptures and paintings to sell their works for tiny sums only to
have them resold years later at much higher prices.
   But R. Frederick Woolworth, president of the Art Dealers
Association of America, said the provision would benefit ``only the
few well-known artists who have established a secondary market for
their works'' and could discourage art sales.
   In a compromise that won the support of the art dealers, the
revised bill calls for the National Endowment for the Arts to study
the issue and report back to Congress.
   Kennedy held a Senate hearing on the bill last month and a House
field hearing in New York City is scheduled for next week.
   The importance of government protection of art goes beyond the
artist's agony over losing a creation, the bill's supporters say.
There are financial ramifications as well.
   ``The continued physical existence, especially of a publicly
displayed work, greatly enhances the artist's reputation and
provides a living portfolio of the artist's work for all to see,''
said Peter H. Karlen, a California attorney who specializes in art
cases.
   Baden sees another attribute in the type of law that led to his
$15,000 settlement with the University of California: the healing of
wounds.
   ``It's like they say, `Don't get mad, get even.' If you're
insulted like that and you don't act, that's what leads to
protracted anger, which is debilitating.''

   ``A resurgence of apathy'' risks reducing the
percentage of minorities on the staffs of the country's newspapers,
the president of the American Society for Newspaper Editors said
today.
   ``Employment freezes, layoffs and last-hired, first-fired
policies threaten to undermine years of minority recruiting,'' said
Loren Ghiglione, who is editor of a small New England newspaper.
   ``Talk of racial diversity has given way to talk of marketing,
competition and circulation. Editors that have established
internship programs for minority students ask whether, given the
tone of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, they face
reverse-discrimination suits,'' he said.
   To counter indifference to the ASNE's goal of making newsroom
staffs equivalent to the racial diversity of the general population
by the year 2000, Ghiglione said he has set out on a three-week
cross-country trip. He will meet with about 100 newspaper editors
and publishers to try to persuade them to step up minority
recruitment.
   He told a news conference that indifference, rather than
hostility, has been the chief problem. He said he found only one
daily among the seven published in Maine employed any blacks,
Hispanics, Asian-Americans or Native Americans on their staffs
despite a sharp increase in Maine's Native American population.
   ``I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the industry
faces a crisis,'' Ghiglione said. ``Several factors _ a so-so
economy, recent Supreme Court decisions (on affirmative action
programs), a resurgence of apathy on the part of the press and
politicians _ suggest that further progress will not come easily.
   ``Indeed, it may not come at all unless each one of us in the
newspaper industry puts more effort into overcoming indffence and
desegregating an industry where 54 percent of the newsrooms still
are all white.''
   On his own paper, the News of Southbridge, Mass., Ghiglione said,
the newsroom staff of 10 includes three minorities. He said that
puts the lie to the excuse offered by many editors, especially on
small papers, that they cannot find qualified minorities.
   ``They can't tell me a tiny newspaper can't recruit,'' he said,
citing his paper's use of job fairs and contacts with black
colleges. ``I'm telling them they can.''
   In April, an ASNE survey, reflecting responses from 64 percent of
the nation's dailies, found minority staffers account for 7.54
percent of the nation's newsroom workforce of 56,200 _ an increase
from 7.02 percent a year earlier. But 54 percent of surveyed papers
reported they did not have one minority staffer.
   If every paper in the country added one minority person to its
staff, Ghiglione said, the rate of increase would jump fivefold
overnight. ``You need to educate newspapers that haven't even
thought about the problem,'' he said.

   The B-2 stealth bomber conducted its
first full-power engine tests today, emerging from its super-secret
research hangar and rolling out onto a desert runway for the first
time under its own power.
   The sleek, bat-like bomber, the most advanced in the Pentagon's
arsenal and capable of penetrating enemy radar defenses without
being detected, taxied onto the runway shortly after sunrise and
began a series of engine tests at various power settings.
   As the tests began, the engines changed in pitch from an eerie
whistle to a low roar. The aircraft then moved from a station near
its secure hangar at a stately pace of about 10 mph for about two
miles down the runway at Air Force Plant 42.
   ``I love it,'' said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Tess Taft, who
waved a small American flag.
   For about two hours the sinister-looking bomber was put through
its engine tests, then moved to the far end of the runway adjacent
to Sierra Highway, where it was visible to passing traffic and gave
the public its first unobstructed view of the menacing flying wing
since it was first displayed on Nov. 22, 1988.
   ``You've got a lot of firsts here today. You have the first time
under its own power, you have it turning. All this has only been
done before on computer simulations,'' said Maj. Pat Mullaney.
   ``So it's real. It's not a hoax,'' said Air Force spokesman Don
Haley. ``It's good to see something happening.''
   At 4:45 a.m., the engines on the prototype of the bomber, which
is expected to cost the Air Force about $500 million each, began
warming up. At 6:25 a.m., the black, boomerang-shaped aircraft,
which is designed to drop nuclear bombs and cruise missiles, rolled
ponderously onto the tarmac.
   As dawn broke at the Mojave Desert Research and Development
Facility, about 50 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, a breeze
whipped across the runway.
   The breeze might have made it difficult to acquire the data
needed for the low-speed test, an Air Force spokeswoman said. But by
the time the B-2 rolled onto the pad, it appeared that winds had
died down.
   After the low-speed taxi tests, the plane will make high-speed
taxi tests and then make its maiden flight sometime within the next
two weeks, said Taft.
   This morning's test was the first time that the radar-evading
bomber had been shown to the public since its unveiling on Nov. 22
to a small group of reporters, aerospace industry representatives
and Pentagon officials.
   Congressional critics have complained that the plane is too
clostly, with an estimated cost of $70 billion dollars for 132
aircraft.
   But Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has defended the nation's
newest and most sophisticated bomber, saying that the sleek,
all-wing bomber is an important technological breakthrough, using
composite fuselage materials to absorb enemy radar waves.
   The low-pitched whistle of the modified General Electric engines
transformed to a dull throaty roar once the airplane was out on the
taxiway.
   Sitting near a pair of B-1 bombers, the aircraft in profile
appeared less than half as long. In fact, the fuselage length of the
B-2 is only about as long as an F-16 fighter plane.
   The bomber is designed to avoid a variety of detection methods.
It generally would be quieter than other strategic aircraft and
because of its shape and the cowling that masks its engines it would
be able to avoid infrared detection in addition to radar.

   The trial of a dissident clergyman
accused of traveling to North Korea was postponed Monday after 150
relatives and friends jeered the judge.
   Also Monday, police stepped up their manhunt for three student
leaders who encouraged travel to the communist nation, offering
rewards of $7,500 for each one's capture.
   A thousand police ringed the Seoul District Criminal Courthouse
when the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan arrived for the second day of his trial.
   More than 150 family members and friends cheered Moon's arrival.
When Judge Chung Sang-hak ordered silence, they protested loudly.
Some shouted anti-government slogans.
   Moon's son, Sung-kun, 36, and Shin Sung-myo, 69, mother of a
political prisoner, were taken away by police.
   The judge postponed the trial until July 24.
   Moon is charged with violating the national security law for a
nine-day trip to Pyongyang in March, when he met President Kim Il
Sung on unifying the peninsula. He faces penalties ranging from
seven years in jail to death.
   South Korea forbids trips to North Korea without approval, saying
talks on reunification must be left to the government.
   Song Han-ho, a vice minister for unification, said Monday he has
told Pyongyang that South Korea was postponing a third round of
talks to arrange a conference to ease tensions.
   Song accused Pyongyang of hypocrisy and trying to subvert the
Seoul government by inviting dissidents to visit while also seeking
dialogue with South Korean authorities.
   Moon, a 71-year-old Presbyterian minister, and his traveling
companion, Yoo Won-ho, 59, were arrested April 13 when they returned
from Pyongyang.
   Yoo testified he did not consider North Korea ``an anti-state
group'' because of President Roh Tae-woo's announced intention to
ease tensions with Pyongyang.
   Meanwhile, the Agency for National Security Planning announced it
will free Lee Chul-yong, an opposition lawmaker arrested for
questioning about whether he had prior knowledge of an illegal visit
to North Korea by a colleague in his Party for Peace and Democracy.
Under South Korean law, detained people must be charged or released
after 48 hours.
   Ten people have been arrested in the visit by legislator Suh
Kyung-won, who was taken into custody June 28. But Lee's detention
proved controversial after intelligence agents first tried
unsuccessfully to detain him by force Thursday.
   Korea was divided at the end of World War II. In 1946, North
Korea invaded South Korea, starting a bloody three-year war.

   East German leader Erich Honecker was released from
a hospital today after treatment for a gallstone and began his
annual vacation on schedule, the government-run news agency ADN said.
   The brief agency report gave no other details.
   The 76-year-old Communist Party leader was forced to return home
early from a Warsaw Pact summit in Romania on Saturday.
   At the time, ADN said he was suffering from an ``acute
gallbladder ailment,'' but made no other mention of Honecker's
condition until today's report.
   Earlier today, a West German newspaper said doctors were fighting
to save Honecker's life. The report by the mass-circulation
newspaper Bild, which quoted no sources, said Honecker was in the
intensive care unit of an East Berlin hospital.
   Honecker, who became East Germany's Communist Party leader in
1971 and assumed the additional post of head of state in 1976,
appeared to be in robust health and alert during recent public
appearances.
   But some West German newspapers, including Bild, have reported in
recent months that Honecker's concentration appeared to be failing
and that he had speech problems.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III took
the stand today as a witness for his long-time friend and former
lawyer, E. Robert Wallach, who is charged with racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal.
   In testimony in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Meese said
Wallach, 55, told him in 1981 _ when Meese was a high-ranking
advisor to President Reagan _ that he was very impressed by the
Wedtech Corp. because it employed minorities in the slums of the
South Bronx.
   He said that Wallach had suggested it would be a good company for
the administration to spotlight in its proposals for urban
enterprise zones.
   Wedtech, once a small South Bronx machine shop, grew into a $100
million government contractor through a special Small Business
Administration program that set aside contracts without competitive
bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   But evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued
to receive the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes
even after its ceased to be a minority-owned company. The company is
defunct.
   Meese said Wallach never asked him to give preferential treatment
to Wedtech. He said his discussions with Wallach while he worked at
the White House covered a wide range of issues of which Wedtech was
only a small part.
   He said he met Wallach in law school at the University of
California at Berkeley. He said they and their families had been
close ever since.
   Wallach and two other men are charged in a 22-count racketeering
indictment with extracting almost $2 million in illegal payoffs and
payments from Wedtech, including some $525,000 in alleged bribes to
Wallach to influence Meese and other government officials.
   Wedtech's former chairman, Fred Neuberger, testified at an
earlier trial that Wedtech paid Wallach $300,000 while he was
serving as Meese's personal attorney during Meese's confirmation
hearings for the attorney general post. There was no evidence
presented that Meese knew about the payments.
   Meese has never been charged with any crimes in connection with
the Wedtech case.

   Economic problems and moral decay are boosting the
Soviet crime rate by nearly 40 percent, and police lack the
resources to fight back, the nation's top law enforcer told
legislators Monday.
   Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin appealed to the Supreme Soviet
to give his department, which runs the national police, more money
to stop crime that has risen under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The 542-member Supreme Soviet questioned Bakatin for an hour,
then voted to retain the 51-year-old career Communist Party official
as interior minister. Bakatin, who has held his post since October,
was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 other officials
appearing before the Supreme Soviet.
   The reconstituted legislature, strengthened by Gorbachev's
political reforms, has rejected several candidates to the cabinet
and supreme court.
   Bakatin told lawmakers that serious crime rose 39.9 percent in
the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 1988.
Adolescent crime rose 11 percent last year and 22 percent so far
this year, he said. Unreported crime is growing at three or four
times the rate of recorded crime, he said, but did not explain the
source of that figure.
   ``Unbalanced development in the economy, politics, social and
moral spheres is inevitable in the transition period through which
Soviet society is going, which in turn provokes tension, shortages,
social injustice and thus stimulates crime,'' Bakatin said.
   Many Soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because of
an increase in murders, muggings and rape. Conservatives blame what
they consider a lax attitude toward youth and say that cooperatives
_ private businesses _ have become targets because of their wealth.
   Bakatin said government is not spending enough to fight crime.
Police salaries are too low and there are shortages of cars, radios
and other equipment, the minister said.
   In the United States, Bakatin said, $100 is spent per capita on
police, whereas in the Soviet Union, the figure is $12.
   Gorbachev, presiding at the session, interrupted Bakatin to say
he had been impressed by the number of police he saw during a visit
to West Germany June 12-16.
   ``I was in the FRG (Federal Republic of Germany) and was talking,
and then I looked around and there were police, police, police.
Where did they come from, armed and with equipment?'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he was told there is one policeman for every 400
Germans. In the Soviet Union, Bakatin reported, there are 17 police
for every 10,000 people, or one for every 588 people.
   The Soviet Union once kept crime statistics secret, claiming
socialism was free of the crime rampant in the West. Bakatin said
such a policy was foolish.
   ``A theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here was
considered officially a rudiment of social antagonism from
exploiting societies which should die as socialism developed,''
Bakatin said. ``But it didn't.''
   Blunt talk also came from another government candidate up for
legislative approval, Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov. He told
legislators the health system is in the ``most severe crisis,'' and
said:
   _ About 63 percent of the nation's hospitals and 59 percent of
clinics are in substandard buildings.
   _ About 24 percent of the hospitals have no sewage facilities,
and 15 percent lack running water.
   _ The Soviet Union spends less money than any developed country
on health care _ 3.2 percent of the Soviet gross national product _
versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the United States.
   Chazov, formerly the personal physician to Kremlin leaders
including Leonid I. Brezhnev, was confirmed as health minister.
   Parliament turned down one nominee, Mikhail I. Busygin, 58, for
the post of forest industries. Deputies said that Busygin, who had
held the post since 1982, had paid too little attention to
ecological problems.
   Busygin also has been a non-voting member of the Communist Party
Central Committee since March 1986, and it was not clear how the
parliamentary vote would affect his party post. On April 25,
Gorbachev purged the committee of so-called ``dead souls,'' who had
lost their main jobs but remained in the Central Committee.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
reopening a door that he had closed last year, said today that as a
public servant he is ``obliged to be open to the possibility'' of
running for president.
   ``Of course you have to be open,'' said Cuomo in an appearance
before the New York State Broadcasters Association.
   Nonetheless, the New York Democrat said all such talk about his
political future was speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run
for president in 1988, but ultimately decided against it.
   Cuomo has said that he expects to run for re-election as governor
next year. In his speech today, he reiterated that he doesn't
believe a person can run for president while serving as governor.
   Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987, that the Democratic Party
would be able to find excellent candidates for the presidency in
1992 without turning to him.
   ``I'll think about it ... but I won't think too much,'' he said
jokingly.
   The governor, recalling speculation that swirled around his
possible presidential ambition for the 1988 Democratic nomination,
said ``at some point you have to end it.'' But he added, ``That
won't happen this morning.''

   Roy Cohn, who as an aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy
in the 1950s made his reputation as an anti-communist crusader, was
himself investigated by the FBI for communist links, a newspaper
reported Monday.
   New York Newsday said it had obtained files under the Freedom of
Information Act that showed that an anonymous correspondent in 1950
wrote to the FBI alleging that Cohn was an active supporter of a
leftist congressman and ``affiliated with several Commie outfits.''
   A federal loyalty review board exonerated Cohn a year later after
an FBI investigation failed to uncover any such evidence, Newsday
said.
   The investigation was contained in 2,000 pages of FBI files
covering 1948 until just before Cohn's death at 59 in 1986.
   Newsday said the files also showed that Hoover and other top
Justice Department officials distrusted Cohn in the early 1950s and
sought to keep information from him, sometimes because Cohn had a
propensity for passing off FBI information as his own.
   At the same time, Newsday said, the files are replete with kudos
from Hoover for Cohn's anti-communist stance. Cohn and Hoover
developed a close relationship.
   As early as 1954 there were allegations that Cohn was homosexual,
but the files contained no evidence that the FBI investigated that
aspect of Cohn's life.
   Cohn always denied the charges. A biography after his death from
AIDS included accounts of alleged sexual encounters with men.
   Cohn was chief counsel to McCarthy, whose Senate hearings helped
create the anti-communist hysteria of the 1950s that cost many
people their jobs and reputations.

<HEAD>Cities, Needing Money, Can't Say ``No New Taxes,'' Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``no new taxes'' promise of federal and
state politicians is a fine campaign slogan but it has put many
cities in bad shape, the National League of Cities reported Monday.
   Officials said that in the end local governments are the ones
stuck with raising taxes and fees to pay their bills.
   ``The ledgers of local government show the reality of what
happens when others say `no new taxes,''' said Alan Beals, executive
director of the league. ``The burden is shifted, the taxes are
shifted, and the cities get clobbered.''
   He said local governments not only have to carry out their
traditional responsibilities but they have to cope with a growing
list ``of crisis issues or unfunded mandates'' from state or federal
agencies.
   The league's report showed that half the 362 cities surveyed are
spending more than they expect to take in in 1989. And 57 percent
said their income is not keeping up with inflation.
   ``When federal government pulls back, state government pulls
back, the impact is on local government,'' Beals said. Asked to
describe the cities' financial ailment in human terms, he said they
were suffering from high stress, high cholesterol level and heart
attack.
   Sixty-nine percent of the cities raised fees and charges for
municipal services last year; 41 percent raised property taxes; 36
percent reported imposing new fees and charges, and 10 percent
instituted new taxes, the report said.
   Beals pointed to new drinking water regulations anticipated by
the Environmental Protection Agency, expected to cost $3 billion for
plants and equipment and $500 million a year to operate.
   ``No one disputes the importance of safe drinking water; when we
have to foot the bills, we are fully justified in objecting to the
relentless federal intrusion into the municipal bond market,'' Beals
said.
   ``By writing clumsy regulations and meddlesome rules that mangle
the municipal bond market, our government is adding millions of
dollars to the cost of financing these projects from our already
strained local tax base.''
   Douglas D. Peterson, senior policy analyst for the league, said
that of the 362 surveyed communities, only 108 report they are ahead
of the game. He cited Sunnyvale, Calif., as taking in 10 percent
more than it is spending; Virginia Beach, Va., 2.4 percent; Kansas
City, Dallas and Minneapolis, 0.5 percent; and Winston-Salem and
Raleigh, N.C. 3 percent.
   Asked for examples of how other cities are managing, Beals cited
Los Angeles cutting back police service, New Orleans cutting back to
four-day workweeks and other cities cutting social services.
   ``The bottom line is they are cutting into essential services,''
Beals said.
   Beals called drug abuse and affordable housing the top problems
facing communities but said they have gone begging for federal money.
   ``At the same time, we see a massive $285 billion bailout of the
scandal-ridden savings and loan industry sailing through Congress
without much anxiety even though it represents the largest federal
outlay since the cost of fighting World War II,'' Beals said.
   The league survey was based on questionnaires sent to fiscal
officers in 828 U.S. cities, including all cities over 50,000 and a
sampling of those between 10,000 and 50,000. The questionnaires were
returned by 362 cities.
   To cope with the tougher-to-get dollars, this is how cities are
responding:
   Increasing fees and charges, 69 percent; reducing growth of
operational spending, 43 percent; increasing property tax rates, 41
percent; imposing new fees and charges, 36 percent; reducing capital
spending, 36 percent; contracting out services, 32 percent; reducing
number of city employees, 24 percent; freezing hiring, 19 percent;
imposing or raising impact fees, 18 percent; increasing other tax
rates, 13 percent; implementing new taxes, 10 percent; reducing city
services, 7 percent; shifting services to other government, 6
percent; increasing sales tax rates 5 percent; increasing income tax
rates 3 percent.

   Be prepared to explain why you are carrying
a camera when visiting Ethiopia, don't travel in the Soviet Union
unless you're in good health, and be sure to have a visa upon
arrival in India or you'll find yourself on the next plane out
regardless of its destination.
   ``Improper sexual relations'' with Chinese citizens are verboten,
and if you are of criminal inclination, never take illegal drugs
into Malaysia, where traffickers face a mandatory death sentence.
   So advises World Status Map, a slick bimonthly publication that
offers such travel advisories and disease warnings below its orange
fold-up map, which colors war zones and other danger spots in red.
   Much of the information comes from the State Department and the
Centers for Disease Control, but publisher Earl W. May of Fairfax
says he uses more than 150 other sources, including the World Health
Organization, the United Nations, world governments and news
services.
   May said in a telephone interview that the idea grew out of his
brother's world travels. May said he offered to find out about civil
unrest and disease in various hot spots for his brother, who worked
for a company that drilled oil around the world.
   He found there was a State Department desk officer for each
country. ``Theoretically, I would have to make 200 calls, and half
the time they weren't at the desk,'' he said.
   He decided there was a need for a publication to pull all of the
available information together.
   The first World Status Map, published by May's WSM Publishing Co.
in Merrifield, came out in 1983. Since then, said May, his
subscription list has grown to more than 2,000 travel agents,
individuals, corporations and universities.
   The most recent map warns that ``detention and heavy fines have
been imposed on visitors engaging in improper sexual relations with
Chinese citizens.''
   May is not sure what those banned relations are, but ``my guess
is just the standard prostitute-type thing. I don't think it is
anything more exotic.''
   Despite the unrest in China, ``it probably is a very safe country
right now'' for travelers, he said. ``China is probably doing all
they can to get those hundreds of thousands of tourists back that
they lost,'' he said.
   Binoculars, cameras and video equipment should not be taken into
Ethiopia, which is ruled by a military government fighting rebels in
the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   ``In many of these countries you are at great risk if you take a
picture of any building that they consider important to the
government or the military,'' he said.
   If you're ill, a sure way to feel even worse is to travel in the
Soviet Union, said May. ``It has to do with the level of medication
and hospital services available,'' he said.
   May also advised against taking alcoholic beverages, even the
tiny sample bottles offered by airlines, into Kuwait.
   ``It's just your basic dry country,'' he said. ``When you arrive,
if you don't declare with a customs agent that you have liquor, you
are subject to arrest if they find it on you.'' Other Islamic
countries have similar restrictions.
   For anyone planning a trip to Europe this summer, it's a
green-light with orange all the way across the continent on the
latest issue of the map. There is this for visitors coming the other
way, however: A warning that the United States is jailing visitors
who arrive with AIDS unless a waiver has been obtained in advance.
   The World Status Map costs $36 for a year's subscription.

<HEAD>Editor Calls for `Desegregating' His Profession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors said Monday that the U.S. press may become a
bastion unless publishers insist on ``desegregating an industry
where 54 percent of the newsrooms still are all white.''
   Loren Ghiglione, who runs the Southbridge (Mass.) News, said he
set out on a three-week cross-country trip last week to visit two
dozen newspapers and meet about 100 editors, publishers and owners
in an effort to increase the industry's minority recruting and
hiring.
   Speaking at a news conference Monday, he sounded pessimistic.
   Slight increases in recent years in employment of blacks,
Hispanics, Asians and American Indians stand to be reversed by a
wave of indifference unless newspaper owners, especially at small
papers, demand that editors recruit minority beginners, Ghiglione
said.
   ``They can't tell me a tiny newspaper can't recruit,'' he said,
citing his own 7,000-circulation paper's use of job fairs and
contacts with black colleges. ``I'm telling them they can.''
   Ghiglione, who is white, said three of the 10 people in his
newsrooms are members of minorities. The paper, he said, is stronger
because of the diversity of views they bring.
   On the first leg of the trip, through Maine, he said he found
only one of seven daily papers had any minorities. He said he has
found no hostility to his goal, but widespread indifference.
   ``You need to educate newspapers that haven't even thought about
the problem,'' he said.
   ``I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the industry
faces a crisis. Several factors _ a so-so economy, recent Supreme
Court decisions (on affirmative action programs), a resurgence of
apathy on the part of the press and politicians _ suggest that
further progress will not come easily.
   ``Indeed, it may not come at all unless each one of us in the
newspaper industry puts more effort into overcoming indifference and
desegregating an industry where 54 percent of the newsrooms still
are all white.''
   In April, an ASNE survey reflecting responses from 64 percent of
the nation's dailies found minority staffers account for 7.54
percent of the nation's newsroom work force of 56,200 _ an increase
from 7.02 percent a year earlier.
   But 54 percent of surveyed papers reported they did not have one
minority staffer.
   Ghiglione cited Census projections that say minorities will
become a majority of the U.S. population in the next century. To
serve such an audience and market, ``the newspaper industry has to
become more than a 92.5 percent white symbol of the status quo,'' he
said.
   He said he doesn't worry when larger papers hire the minority
staff he has recruited and trained.
   ``We lose all our good people,'' he said. ``We'll always be a
graduate school.''

<HEAD>East German Leader Treated For Gallstone Ailment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German Communist Party leader Erich Honecker
was released from a hospital Monday after treatment for a gallstone,
the state-run news agency ADN said.
   The brief dispatch followed a report in a West German newspaper
that Honecker, 76, was fighting for his life.
   ADN said he was released after being treated for a gallstone and
began his summer vacation on schedule, but the news agency gave no
other details.
   Honecker was forced to return home early from a Warsaw Pact
summit in Romania on Saturday. At the time, ADN said he was
suffering from an ``acute gallbladder ailment,'' but made no other
mention of Honecker's condition until Monday's report.
   The report came shortly after Karl-Heinz Hiersmann, a leader of
the West Germany's opposition Social Democratic party in Bavaria,
said Honecker's ailment was ``nothing serious.''
   Hiersmann said in East Berlin that his information came from
Hermann Axen, a member of East Germany's policy-making party
Politburo.
   The West German newspaper Bild reported earlier today that
doctors were fighting to save Honecker's life. The Bild report,
which quoted no sources, said Honecker was in the intensive care
unit of an East Berlin hospital.
   Honecker, who became party chief in 1971 and head of state in
1976, appeared to be in robust health and alert during recent public
appearances.
   But Bild and some other West German newspapers have reported that
Honecker's concentration appeared to be failing in recent months and
that he had speech problems.

<HEAD>Death Sentences Confirmed For Cuban Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's top government council, led by
President Fidel Castro, turned down an army hero's appeal and
affirmed his death sentence by firing squad for drug trafficking,
the official Cuban news agency said Monday.
   The 29-member Council of State unanimously upheld the death
sentences against former Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other
officers, according to the Prensa Latina report, which was monitored
in Mexico.
   The decision apparently exhausted the last appeal for Ochoa, who
was convicted of helping smuggle tons of cocaine and shiploads of
marijuana into the United States.
   The council made its decision Sunday night, Prensa Latina said.
   The news agency did not say when the death sentences would be
carried out or whether Castro could or would consider executive
clemency. The Council of State is made up of senior government
officials and is chaired by Castro.
   The military division of the supreme court already had refused to
overturn the death sentences given Ochoa and Col. Antonio de la
Guardia, Maj. Armando Padron and Capt. Jorge Martinez.
   The highly publicized case has been an embarrassment to Castro
and the Communist Party. Castro spent years denying U.S. accusations
that Cuba was being used to smuggle drugs, saying the accusations
were part of a U.S. plot to discredit the revolution.
   Ochoa and three other officers were sentenced to death for their
parts in helping smuggle Colombian cocaine and Jamaican marijuana
into the United States across Cuban seas and airspace.
   The court-martial prosecutor said that the men had committed
crimes against foreign nations, among them the United States.
   Ten other officers were convicted in the case, which also
involved smuggling of diamonds, ivory and dollars, and sentenced to
terms ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison.
   All 14 of the convicted men were officers of the Cuban armed
forces or held high positions in the security staff of the Interior
Ministry.
   A military court of honor stripped Ochoa and the other 13
defendants of all rank and decorations and gave them dishonorable
discharges before the court-martial began last week.
   On Friday, the court-martial convicted them on charges of drug
trafficking, corruption and treason.
   The arrests and trial constituted the biggest scandal to rock
Cuba since Castro came to power Jan. 1, 1959.
   Ochoa, 57, had fought alongside Castro in Cuba's rugged mountains
during the revolution that overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista,
became a trusted aide and carried out confidential missions for
Castro.
   Ochoa had been named a Hero of the Republic, the nation's highest
military honor, for leading Cuban military expeditions to Angola and
Ethiopia and heading a military advisory team to Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists Monday protested plans to
bring a scaled down version of the largest Canadian rodeo to the
city's new SkyDome stadium next year.
   ``We view rodeos as a desensitizing experience that publicize the
notion that this type of treatment is acceptable,'' said Michael
O'Sullivan, spokesman for the local chapter of the World Society for
the Protection of Animals.
   ``We don't need to import this kind of cruelty to animals,'' he
said.
   Mayor Arthur Eggleton was in Calgary, Alberta, over the weekend
for the announcement that the Calgary Stampede would stage three
shows at the SkyDome in September or October 1990 depending on the
Toronto Blue Jays' baseball schedule.
   ``Toronto natives know about the Stampede,'' said the mayor,
wearing a white hat and blue Western shirt. ``Now they'll be able to
experience it.''
   The SkyDome, the world's first stadium with a retractable roof,
opened last month. It houses the Blue Jays, the Toronto Argonauts in
the Canadian Football League and special events.
   The Stampede is a combined agricultural fair and rodeo each July
that dates to 1886 in Calgary and calls itself ``The Greatest
Outdoor Show on Earth.'' The Toronto show would be the first ever
outside the western province of Alberta.
   O'Sullivan said the mayor should have held some form of public
hearing before the plans were announced. He said his organization
will approach the City Council to seek a ban on any rodeo events in
Toronto as well as campaign with the SkyDome's management and the
rodeo's corporate sponsor.
   He said the last protest of rodeo events in Toronto took place in
the early 1980s at the Canadian National Exhibition, the fair held
at the end of each summer. No such events have been held more
recently.
   ``SkyDome officials came to us last week and said this was
something that was in the works,'' said Barry MacKay of the Toronto
Humane Society. ``We feel that the best way to prevent an accident
to an animal is simply not do it.''
   He said the society considers virtually all events in a rodeo
treat animals in an unnatural way. While rodeos are a tradition in
some parts of the country, MacKay said, that tradition does not
exist in Toronto.
   ``I can understand the Calgary Stampede in the cultural context
of the Wild West,'' said Nadine Nowlan, a member of the City
Council. ``But it's quite contrary to our whole history and
tradition. We're not the Wild West, thank God.''
   Bob Church, the Stampede's president, said a committee had been
studying for two years whether to package a show that could travel
to the United States and Canadian cities.

   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
promised today that an investigation into abuses in HUD programs
won't be used as an excuse to gut housing subsidies for low- and
moderate-income Americans.
   Kemp, in a speech to the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, also praised the
role of the NAACP in extending the American dream to blacks.
   The NAACP, he said, has been the central mover in a two-step
process to win equality for minorities. He said the process was half
finished.
   ``Chapter One is a proud part of our country's history,'' the
housing secretary said. But he said the United States couldn't
effectively promote its system as a model for the world until it
finishes the next stage _ achieving equal economic opportunity as
well.
   Kemp received three standing ovations from the audience of 3,000.
   The NAACP convention opened Sunday with a speech from its
executive director, Benjamin Hooks. Hooks said President Bush has
lifted the ``iron curtain'' separating blacks from the White House
but recent Supreme Court rulings pose a critical challenge to
minorities.
   ``The conservative majority that now holds sway seem determined,
and yes, hellbent on consigning civil rights and affirmative action
gains to the ash heap of history,'' Hooks said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle will address the civil rights
organization Wednesday. The convention ends Thursday.
   ``This Supreme Court is dangerous to the well being of black
people, women and other minorities,'' Hooks said Sunday.
   ``It is more dangerous to the legitimate hopes and aspirations of
black people in this nation than any Bull Connor with a firehose;
than any Jim Clark with a billy club; more dangerous than any Ross
Barnett standing in the schoolhouse saying, `They shall not pass';
more dangerous than George Wallace proclaiming `Segregation today,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,''' he said.
   Connor was public safety commissioner in Birmingham, Ala., and
Clark was a sheriff in Alabama during the desegregation of the 1950s
and early 1960s. Barnett and Wallace were governors of Mississippi
and Alabama, respectively.
   Minority group leaders may need to revive the civil disobedience
of past decades if the Bush administration and Congress fail to
counter the anti-civil rights sentiment fostered by the high court,
Hooks said.
   ``If Congress does not act, we must call upon our citizenry to
mount such powerful demonstrations that the group gathered in China
not long ago will look like a few compared with the millions that we
mobilize,'' he said.
   Hooks gave Bush qualified praise for some of the people he
appointed to serve in the administration and for meeting with Jesse
Jackson and Coretta Scott King.
   ``Bush has brought civility to Pennsylvania Avenue,'' he said.
``There is no question that President Bush had done much to raise
the iron curtain that had separated the White House from black
Americans over the past several years.''
   The NAACP, however, has not given blanket approval to the
administration, Hooks said.
   ``Attorney General Richard Thornburgh must pull his head out of
the sand and realize that his advice to the president on these court
rulings was totally wrong. We urge him to rethink his position that
nothing has really changed,'' Hooks said.
   Bush can make a difference in civil rights legislation, but must
take a stronger public stand, the NAACP leader said.
   The president, for example, should consider either revamping or
dismantling the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, which Hooks said
became an ``unmitigated disaster'' during the Reagan era.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Arraigned On Conspiracy, Racketeering Charges</HEAD>

   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar pleaded
innocent today to charges of using his office to do favors for
convicted felons, crimes punishable by up to 55 years in prison.
   Aguilar, the fourth federal judge in the nation to be indicted in
the last decade and the first ever for racketeering, was arraigned
before a visiting federal judge, Howard Bratton of New Mexico, and
released without bail. His trial has also been assigned to an
outside judge, Louis Bechtle of Philadelphia.
   The 58-year-old judge stood with his lawyers for less than three
minutes before the bench and spoke only a few words _ identifying
himself, giving his age, and saying ``the plea is not guilty'' _
before Bratton said further reading of the charges was not necessary.
   Bratton denied a request by Justice Department prosecutor Ralph
Martin to prohibit Aguilar from contacting potential witnesses.
Defense lawyer Patrick Hallinan told reporters the request would
have barred Aguilar from speaking to ``half of his family'' and
described it as part of the government's campaign to portray Aguilar
as a corrupt judge.
   Aguilar left through a rear exit and did not speak with
reporters. Before the hearing, he sat talking and laughing with
defense lawyers and did not look at codefendants Rudy Tham, an
imprisoned former labor leader, and Abe Chapman, a self-styled
former mobster related to Aguilar by marriage.
   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy Carter, was indicted
by a federal grand jury last month on eight felony charges. He has
relinquished most of his duties while the case is pending.
   He is accused of approaching two other federal judges to seek
favorable treatment for Tham and another man, Ronald Cloud, a former
law client of Aguilar's who was convicted of bank fraud; of trying
to help Tham get a new trial while Tham arranged a job for Aguilar's
brother; and of tipping Chapman that his phone was being tapped.
   Aguilar is also accused of helping his former secretary, Vera
Hoff, remain a fugitive in Mexico, where she fled after being
convicted of tax evasion. The judge is additionally charged with
lying to the FBI and advising one of Tham's lawyers to lie to the
grand jury.
   The racketeering charge alleges Aguilar used his office as a
racketeering ``enterprise'' to obstruct justice.
   Hallinan, speaking to reporters after the hearing, said he had
investigated the case ``assiduously'' and ``can find no substance to
any of the allegations.''
   He said Aguilar's mood was ``one of great optimism ... a
conviction that the final result will be a happy one.''
   Tham and Chapman also pleaded innocent to the charges. No trial
date has been set.

   A churchgoing accountant arrested on a TV
viewer's tip in June pleaded innocent Monday to murdering five
family members 18 years ago.
   The man authorities say is John E. List, 63, but who calls
himself Robert P. Clark did not speak at the hearing, entering his
plea through his lawyer.
   Superior Court Judge William Wertheimer agreed to the
prosecutor's request for $5 million bail and set trial for Dec. 4.
   FBI agents said List assumed a new identity after shooting to
death his three children, wife and mother at their home in Westfield
in 1971.
   Clark, arrested in Richmond, Va., denies he is List, but FBI
agents said they identified him through fingerprints and a scar from
a mastoid operation.
   The bodies of List's wife and children were found a month after
the killings, neatly laid side-by-side in the ballroom of their
19-room mansion. The body of his 85-year-old mother was in a bedroom.
   A worldwide manhunt ensued, but all leads hit dead ends until
June 1, when Clark was arrested at the Richmond accounting firm
where he had worked for 18 months.
   FBI agents had been tipped off by a viewer of the TV program
``America's Most Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment
on List and shown a bust depicting how the former Sunday school
teacher might look today.
   Authorities say List fled to Colorado, then Virginia, remarried
and built a new life without changing his appearance, profession or
reputation as a quiet churchgoing Lutheran.
   His new wife said she knew nothing of his alleged past but that
she would stand by him.

   Thousands of Khmer Rouge refugees living
on the Thai-Cambodian border have fled heavy artillery attacks and
entered a U.N.- controlled camp, relief officials said Monday.
   In the past week, about 10,000 Khmer Rouge refugees have moved to
the new Site K camp on Thailand's eastern frontier southwest of
Bangkok, to join about 3,000 others who have lived there since June,
said a relief official, who asked not to be identified.
   Officials said they believe the new arrivals have come from Phum
Thmei, one of many military camps under Khmer Rouge control along
the Thai-Cambodian border. Phum Thmei has reportedly suffered heavy
shelling from Cambodia, which is backed by Vietnamese forces.
   Last week, relief officials said they were encouraged by what
appeared to be a gradual improvement in recent months in the
relationship between Khmer Rouge and international humanitarian
organizations.
   Diplomats, relief workers and international human rights agencies
have accused the Khmer Rouge of human rights abuses against the
civilian population under their control.
   Some officials speculate that by allowing the refugees to move
into U.N.-assisted areas, the Khmer Rouge may be trying to present a
better image in advance of an international conference on Cambodia
in Paris next month.
   The Vietnamese government has promised to pull its troops out by
the end of September and the conference is expected to discuss
formation of an interim Cambodian government.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during its
3{-year rule after 1975. They have fought a guerrilla war from bases
along the Thai frontier since being ousted by the Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia in 1978.
   Relief workers say that 50,000 Khmer Rouge civilians live in
camps supervised by the U.N. Border Relief Operation. But the number
living in secret military bases outside U.N. control could be twice
that large, they said.
   Farther north from Phum Thmei, the population of another Khmer
Rouge refugee camp along the border at O'trao has swollen to over
10,000 due to new arrivals from military camps, relief officials
said.
   Khmer Rouge officials have permitted medical teams to vaccinate
8,000 people in two military camps near the U.N.-administered Site 8
camp, they said.
   In mid-April about 700 Cambodians left the secretive Khmer Rouge
camp of Kaiche after it was heavily shelled and traveled a few miles
to Sok Sann camp, run by the non-communist guerrillas of the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front.

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberations in Palme Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judges and jury Monday began
deliberating the fate of an ex-convict accused of assassinating
Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   ``My name is Christer Pettersson and I did not kill Olof Palme,''
the defendant said when asked for a statement at the close of his
five-week trial.
   Pettersson, 42, is charged with killing Palme in 1986 as the
four-term prime minister was walking home from a movie with his
wife, Lisbeth, who was the prosecution's key witness.
   Presiding District Judge Carl-Anton Spak rejected a defense
request to dismiss the case for lack of evidence. He said that on
Thursday, he will announce the date the court will deliver its
judgment. The two judges and six jurors each have a vote and, if the
court is split evenly, the presiding judge has the final say.
   Pettersson, who has served a jail term for manslughter and has a
history of drug abuse, faces a mandatory life sentence. But, in
practice, the government always commutes such sentences to prison
terms of less than 20 years, with parole available.
   Defense lawyers say they will appeal if Pettersson is found
guilty.
   In a 90-minute summation, Arne Liljeros said the prosecution
lacks physical evidence to back testimony from Mrs. Palme and other
witnesses who said they saw Pettersson at or near the street corner
where Palme was shot.
   He said there are no motive, no murder weapon, no fingerprints
and no powder burns on clothing to link his client to the shooting.
   ``It must simply not happen that an innocent person is sentenced.
Thoughts must not even touch on a miscarriage of justice,'' he said.
   Liljeros suggested Palme was assassinated in a political
conspiracy, and criticized the court for refusing to let him
introduce evidence that could point to a plot.
   The prosecution's case is built on a series of ``coincidences
which don't happen in real life. The shot at Palme was a
professional job,'' he said.
   ``Olof Palme was a public figure and controversial both in Sweden
and abroad,'' and many people would have an interest in removing
him, Liljeros said.
   Palme dominated Swedish politics for a decade and earned his
socialist-minded country its reputation as an international mediator
and champion of disarmament.
   The prosecution relied heavily on Mrs. Palme's identification of
Pettersson as the man she saw a few feet away after Palme fell to
the street, fatally wounded. She was slightly wounded.
   Liljeros said Mrs. Palme's memory after three years should be
considered unreliable and attacked her behavior.
   ``Lisbeth Palme is a threat to the rule of law in this case,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Palme had demanded Pettersson be removed from the courtroom
while she testified. He was brought at the end of her testimony for
her identification.
   Summarizing his case Thursday, prosecutor Anders Helin said
Pettersson is the only man Mrs. Palme has identified from
photographs of 647 possible suspects and two police lineups.
   The prosecution maintains Petersson is hostile to authority, and
offers this as a motive.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday that he will send an emissary to the Middle East to test
Israel's commitment to holding elections among Palestinian Arabs on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker, who is traveling with President Bush, said at a news
conference that the adoption of a hard-line stance by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir at a Likud party convention last week raised
questions about the government position.
   The emissary, Baker said, will ``determine the extent to which
the Israeli government is still committed to their elections
proposals in the aftermath of the Likud party convention.''
   In Jerusalem on Monday, Labor Party leaders recommended that
their party quit the governing coalition to protest the Likud bloc's
tougher conditions for peace talks.
   The move could bring down the government and, eight months after
the last national elections, force a new vote.
   Baker said four points approved by Shamir ``give rise, at least
in our minds, to questions about the seriousness of purpose.''
   The Likud leadership opposes establishment of a Palestinian state
and yielding territory on the West Bank or in Gaza, as well as
barring Palestinians in East Jerusalem from voting and requiring an
end to violence in the territories before balloting could begin.
   Shamir's plan would provide local self-rule to Palestinians for
five years after which Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians
would negotiate a settlement.
   None of the points marked a change in Shamir's position, but
their reaffirmation while the administration is failing to persuade
the Arabs to agree to elections is considered a setback to U.S.
diplomacy.
   Baker doesn't support a Mideast peace conference, a proposal that
has widespread Arab and West European support.
   ``The time is not right now,'' he said.
   Shamir is opposed to such a conference because it might give the
Soviets a prominent role in support of Arab positions.
   A senior U.S. official traveling with Baker said no parallel
talks were planned with the Palestine Liberation Organization. PLO
support for elections is considered essential, but it has denounced
them as a ploy to prevent a Palestinian state.
   Baker didn't say whom he would send to Israel next week, but
added that reports that it would be Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger could be mistaken.

<HEAD>Official Says Anti-Inflation Measures Will Not Cause Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby
said Monday successful inflation-fighting efforts are steering the
economy to a so-called ``soft-landing'' _ slower but continued
growth, but no recession.
   ``The economic expansion is proceeding at a sustainable pace with
favorable prospects for continued growth ahead,'' he said in a
speech prepared for the annual meeting of The International
Insurance Society in Chicago. Copies were made available here.
   At the same time, Darby said, ``We are about to experience a
diminution of inflationary pressures brought about by past
restrictive measures of the Federal Reserve.''
   Until recently, the Fed had tightened its grip on credit to slow
the economy and thus stem inflation. It began easing its grip last
month and permitted a key interest rate to decline slightly again
last week.
   In response, short-term interest rates in the bond market have
been falling steadily. And on Monday, Chase Manhattan Bank lowered
its prime lending rate by a half percentage point to 10.5 percent,
the second such reduction in as many months. Other commrcial banks
were expected to follow suit.
   Darby noted concerns that inflation may be accelerating again
because of consumer and producer price increases so far this year
but said those concerns are misplaced.
   ``The recent price increases are temporary effects of
drought-related food price rises and of increases in oil prices
which do not seem to be continuing,'' he said.
   Darby also noted the economy now is in its seventh year of
growth, ``the longest peacetime expansion in our history,'' which he
said ``makes pessimists worry, saying we are due for a recession.
   ``But economic history teaches us that expansions have not died
of old age, but were killed by policies _ usually monetary policies
_ which, with the benefit of hindsight, were unfortunate mistakes,''
he contended.
   Darby pointed out current policies he said will foster continued
economic improvement.
   ``At present, the economy is experiencing moderate growth, with
the major stimulus coming from business fixed investment and
exports,'' he said. ``The consumer is spending cautiously _ saving a
bit more of after-tax income than in recent years.
   ``Housing has weakened, but recent reductions in mortgage
interest rates may offer some relief in months ahead,'' he
continued. ``Defense industries are in a period of retrenchment
after a lengthy buildup ... Inventory investment generally has been
conservative, though the auto industry currently has problems with
too many unsold cars.
   ``Given these crosscurrents in economic activity and the
favorable inflation outlook, prospects are good for growth in the
nonfarm economy in the 2 to 3 percent range over the four quarters
of 1989 _ what is being called a `soft-landing.'''

   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
backed by helicopter gunships killed three guerrillas Monday in
south Lebanon, police said.
   The thrust by 70 Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army followed an attack by three Palestinian and leftist
Lebanese factions on Israel's self-designated ``security zone''
along the border, police said.
   An Israeli army spokesman said the militiamen killed the three
guerrillas and that Israeli forces in a separate operation detained
a number of suspects.
   Guerrillas armed with automatic weapons targeted a joint patrol
of Israelis and the mainly Christian militiamen on the zone's
northern edge, said a police spokesman who cannot be identified in
line with standing regulations.
   Two hours later, 13 armored personnel carriers rolled out of the
buffer zone to counterattack suspected guerrilla hideouts around the
villages of Zillaya and Dellaya in the foothills of Mount Hermon,
the spokesman said.
   The South Lebanon Army gave the bodies of the three guerrillas to
the International Red Cross just before the incursion force withdrew
into the zone at midday without suffering any casualties, the
spokesman said.
   He said Israeli helicopter gunships strafed Zillaya and Dellaya
in repeated runs for an hour after the withdrawal.
   In Jerusalem, an army spokesman indicated there were two separate
operations by Israeli troops and the 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army.
   He said the militia killed three guerrillas armed with rocket
propelled grenades, bombs and personal weapons in the Hasbaya area
in what appeared to be the clash that followed the Palestinian
assault.
   He denied Israeli troops were involved in this operation in the
eastern sector of the security zone, a six- to 10-mile area just
north of the border that Israel carved out in 1985 as a buffer
against guerrilla forays.
   The spokesman said a combined Israeli force of infantry,
artillery and tanks launched a ``preventive'' attack north of the
zone against guerrilla bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, near the villages of Klea and Zillaya in the morning.
   He said the area has been used by Hezbollah to prepare and launch
attacks on the security zone.
   The raiding force, he said, detained an undetermined number of
suspects. He reported no casualties from that raid.
   Before the pullback, the Israeli force distributed leaflets
warning the population against collaboration with guerrillas.
   In Beirut, the Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction headed by
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal said two of its guerrillas were
killed and a third was slightly wounded in a clash overnight with
the South Lebanon Army east of the southern port of Sidon.
   A communique from the group said the clash flared at the village
of Saffarin near Jezzine, the largest Christian town in south
Lebanon that forms the northern tip of the security zone. Jezzine is
15 miles east of Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon about 25
miles south of Beirut.
   Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh refugee camps house the bulk
of the Palestinian guerrilla forces in Lebanon.

   The Agriculture Department has some
common-sense advice for Americans: Eat right and stay healthy.
   USDA officials Monday unveiled four booklets designed to help
Americans shop for food, fix quick meals, eat out and snack.
   Susan Welsh, director of nutrition education for the department's
Human Nutrition Information Service, said agency studies indicate
that consumers ``may be confused by, and weary of, seemingly
conflicting advice on what they should and shouldn't eat.''
   The new effort, including the booklets, is intended to let people
know ``they can eat healthier without changing all their eating
habits overnight or giving up their favorite foods,'' she said.
   Among the common-sense advice is to eat a variety of food,
maintain desirable weight and eat food with adequate starch and
fiber. The agency suggests avoiding eating too much food with fat,
saturated fat, sugar or sodium.
   The suggestions are based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
developed by USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services in
1980. The guidelines, slightly revised in 1985, are being reviewed
for further changes, possibly by 1991.
   Booklets include:
   _Preparing Foods and Planning Menus Using the Dietary Guidelines;
$2.50, Item No. 172-V.
   _Making Bag Lunches, Snacks and Desserts Using the Dietary
Guidelines; $2.50, Item No. 173-V.
   _Shopping for Food and Making Meals in Minutes Using the Dietary
Guidelines; $3, Item No. 174-V.
   _Eating Better When Eating Out Using the Dietary Guidelines;
$1.50, Item No. 175-V.

   Seven weeks of testing hogs and poultry in 10
states have produced no evidence of further contamination by the
cancer-causing pesticide heptachlor, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   Ronald J. Prucha, acting administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Servce, said hogs and poultry from more than
500 producers were sampled and that none showed traces of heptachlor.
   The testing began May 8 in Arkansas after illegally high levels
of the chemical were found in a Batesville poultry plant. Three
swine in the Batesville area in February and March were found to
have heptachlor traces.
   Contaminated feed has been mentioned frequently as a possible
source of the chemical, and a number of feed mills have been under
investigation.
   Heptachlor was banned in 1978 by the Environmental Protection
Agency for all agricultural uses except seed treatment. It has been
shown to cause tumors in laboratory mice.
   Prucha said testing began in nine states near Arkansas on May 22,
including: Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky and Illinois.
   ``We're very encouraged by the results so far,'' he said.
``However, we plan to continue testing for at least the next few
months.''
   Prucha said no further decisions would be made until more
complete results are ready.

<TEXT>
   China's Communist Party sought to restore its
tainted image Monday by publicizing a nationwide crackdown on
corruption in its ranks _ one of the demands of the student movement
crushed by the government.
   New party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also met two foreign
delegations, from Romania and Ethiopia, in a show of diplomacy as
usual despite icy relations with Western governments protesting
China's bloody suppression of unarmed demonstrators.
   Every major daily newspaper carried lengthy articles Monday on
the expulsion and other punishment of party members caught
embezzling, profiteering and abusing their power.
   An end to official corruption was one of the calls of student-led
demonstrators. They also demanded freedom of the press and a
dialogue with government officials.
   The People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the 47.7
million-member party that is the world's biggest political
organization, said 452 officials in the southern province of Guizhou
were expelled for corruption in the first half of 1989.
   On Sunday, it was reported that a local party leader in Guizhou
was sentenced to death for selling bootleg liquor.
   The government, which ordered troops into Beijing on June 3-4 to
crush the student movement, now has seized the corruption issue as
its own.
   ``The recent turmoil and rebellion included many people because
some party members, cadres and especially a minority of leaders were
engaged in corrupt practices which made the people very
dissatisfied,'' the People's Daily said.
   ``Organizers of the rebellion used anti-corruption slogans to
incite the uncertain public,'' it said.
   Among other cases reported Monday, the vice chairman of the
commodity prices committee in western Gansu province was expelled
from the party for making $170,000 by profiteering in sugar.
   Another Gansu official was punished for using public funds to buy
a private home and a third sold state-supplied medicine and used the
money to hold an elaborate funeral for his wife.
   The Worker's Daily said a 32-year-old worker in central China's
Shanxi province will be executed for embezzling $219,000 in public
funds.
   Guangming Daily said party members in Inner Mongolia must admit
voluntarily to all corrupt activities and that 450 people have been
arrested since a corruption reporting center opened in Shanghai a
year ago.
   State TV gave prominent coverage to new party boss Jiang Zemin
meeting Monday with delegations Communist parties from Romania and
Ethiopia.
   Xinhua News Agency said Jiang thanked the Romanian party for its
understanding and support ``at a time when China is confronted with
temporary difficulties.''
   Jiang, former party chief in Shanghai, was named party chief last
month after Zhao Ziyang was purged of party posts for opposing the
use of force.
   Xinhua also quoted Peng Chong, vice chairman of China's
legislature, as expressing ``sincere thanks'' to the ambassador of
North Korea for supporting China's handling of the
``counterrevolutionary conspiracy.''
   Almost all high-level diplomatic contacts between China and the
West have been frozen because of the military attack on protesters
and arrests of more than 2,000 people across the country.
   China continued to attack the United States on Monday, with the
Beijing Daily saying the United States, with its discrimination
against blacks and other minorities, has no right to condemn China's
human rights record.
   The article criticized President Bush, who visited Beijing in
February ``in the role of an old friend of China,'' for inviting
dissident Fang Lizhi to a banquet attended by senior Chinese leaders.
   Fang, who was turned away from the banquet by police, took refuge
in the U.S. Embassy following the crackdown. The government has put
him on a wanted list for counterrevolutionary crimes.
   The People's Daily commentary stressed student protesters need
greater ideological education but will not be punished, while those
who led the movement ``will not be forgiven.''
   In the West, a leading Chinese dissident was quoted Monday as
saying that senior leader Deng Xiaoping could order thousands of
executions. Twenty-seven people have been executed in China since
June 4, many of them student leaders. Others executed were common
criminals.
   ``Deng now will, so I believe, have thousands of people killed,
first the students, then the intellectuals,'' said Yan Jiaqi, former
director of the Beijing Institute of Political Studies, in the West
German magazine Der Spiegel. It said its reporters spoke to Yan in
Paris, where he fled last month.
   Monday's editions of the Paris newspaper Le Monde quoted Yan as
saying: ``The cruelty of Deng Xiaoping goes way beyond that of Mao
(Tse-tung) and Chiang Kai-shek.
   ``The massacre of June 4 was 10, 20, 100 times crueler than the
Cultural Revolution,'' he said. During the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, ``people were suppressed with clubs, whereas today, they
use tanks and rifles to gun down the crowd,'' Yan said.

<HEAD>Bush Aid Offer Pales Against Poland's Needs</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's $115 million aid package
for Poland, intentions aside, is a drop in the bucket for a nation
crushed by $39 billion in foreign debt.
   Bush's visit provided a strong, symbolic boost for the advocates
of democratic reforms. In a country grappling with political
uncertainty, he went out of his way to strengthen the hand of the
Solidarity trade union and to encourage changes throughout Eastern
Europe.
   But he did not offer much in the way of financial help.
   Brushing off suggestions that Poles would be disappointed,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``No one we've met with
so far has intimated that they expected the president of the United
States to show up here with a big wheelbarrow full of dollars.''
   Bush offered a number of steps, promising to seek international
debt relief and to press for approval of $325 million in loans that
are being considered by the World Bank.
   However, the only proposals with a direct cost for Washington
were creation of a $100 million fund to spur development of the
private sector, and a proposal for $15 million in environmental
cleanup for the city of Krakow.
   Neither step will do much to curb Poland's rampant inflation,
running at 100 percent, or ease critical shortages of food and
consumer products.
   Perhaps it was the recognition that Bush was not going to provide
a magic solution for Poland's problems that kept down the size of
street crowds greeting the president.
   Crowds of just 2,000 to 3,000 people turned out to see Bush at
public events in Warsaw, despite efforts by U.S. officials and
Solidarity leaders to drum up interest in his visit.
   American officials were sensitive to possible unfavorable
comparisons between Bush's reception here and the enthusiastic
crowds that greeted Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in West
Germany last month.
   ``It's not some election campaign where we've gone out here and
tried to turn out crowds,'' insisted Baker, despite evidence to the
contrary. Bush emphasized that Poland needs more than outside help.
The U.S. view is that Poland must overhaul its economy to a
free-market system, abandoning politically popular government
subsidies and imposing other belt-tightening measures.
   ``I must speak honestly,'' Bush told Poland's Parliament as he
outlined the modest U.S. aid program. ``Economic reform and recovery
cannot occur without sacrifices.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu argued that rewarding
democratic reforms with a lot of money ``could be perceived by the
Soviet Union and some of the countries in Eastern Europe as merely
an attempt to buy the Soviet Union out of influence in this region.''
   Perhaps mindful that infusions of cash in the 1970s did not
revitalize Poland's economy, Sununu bluntly said, ``You can't create
the problem of a young person in the candy store, where there is so
much there that they don't know which direction to take and don't
have the self-discipline to take the right steps.''
   If nothing else, Bush's visit was a shot in the arm for
Solidarity, the once outlawed labor union that now sits in
Parliament as the first freely elected opposition party in the
communist world.
   He made a deliberate gesture on behalf of Solidarity at a
luncheon he gave for political leaders and others at the residence
of U.S. Ambassador John Davis.
   Bronislaw Geremek, the leader of Solidarity in the Parliament and
a top adviser to Lech Walesa, got a seat of honor next to Bush at
the head table.
   Some distance away, at a table with Bush's wife, Barbara, sat
Poland's leader, Communist chief Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who
imposed martial law in 1981 to crush Solidarity and imprison its
leaders.
   Geremek told the luncheon that the future of Poland's reforms
depends on Poles alone. ``We do not expect that they will be carried
at somebody else's cost or by others' hands.''
   He said Bush's declaration of support for political reforms were
``exactly what we expected'' and were ``the words that we were
hoping for.''
   Maybe so. But a request by Solidarity for $10 billion in Western
aid still remains alive. And in a meeting Tuesday in the Baltic Sea
city of Gdansk, Walesa, himself, will personally make the request of
Bush.

   Gov. Bob Martinez's acting abilities are
up for review in the latest James Bond movie, ``Licence to Kill.''
   ``My name is Martinez, Bob Martinez,'' the governor said in his
best Bond imitation as he welcomed 300 guests Sunday for the
Tallahassee premiere of the movie, which stars Timothy Dalton as
Bond. The film opens this week across the state.
   Martinez's non-speaking cameo as a Customs agent in an airport
scene drew applause from the audience. That scene and much of the
rest of the film were shot in Key West.
   The governor got the spot as a result of a 1987 trip to
California to drum up movie business for Florida.

   The role of Jack Nicholson's girlfriend in
``Batman'' was practically Jerry Hall's for the asking.
   ``I was making a commercial in the studio where the movie was
being shot,'' the actress and model says in the August issue of
Glamour magazine. ``Some man had his door open and hollered:
`Beauty! Where did you come from?'''
   ``I saw that his door said `Batman,' so I said, `Do you have a
job for me?' He said, `Are you kidding? Of course we do!'''
   The man, who was not identified in the article, introduced her to
the director, according to Glamour. Hall later auditioned and won
the part.
   Nicholson plays the arch-villain Joker in the hit movie starring
Michael Keaton as Batman.
   Glamour says the only thing Hall hasn't talked her way into is a
walk down the aisle with long-time boyfriend Mick Jagger. ``I always
wanted to get married. But when I wanted to, he didn't and when he
wanted to, I didn't,'' she said.

   Former Sen. Barry Goldwater, plagued for years
with an arthritic knee and hip, was reported in good condition
Monday after corrective surgery.
   The 80-year-old Arizona Republican is doing ``very, very well''
and probably will be discharged in in four to seven days, said Mary
Starmann-Harrison, chief executive officer of St. Luke's Medical
Center.
   The surgery was Wednesday.
   Goldwater underwent knee surgery at St. Luke's in 1987 to relieve
pain from a college football injury. He underwent hip operations in
1976, 1981 and 1986.
   He also underwent triple-bypass heart surgery in 1982.

   Eileen Brennan broke her left leg, which
had been severely injured in a 1982 auto accident, and bumped her
head when she fell from a stage into an orchestra pit during a
rehearsal of ``Annie.''
   Ms. Brennan was in fair condition Monday at Research Hospital &amp;
Medical Center after the accident Sunday, said Julie Millard,
hospital spokeswoman.
   The actress was to play the role of the orphanage's head mistress
when the musical opened at the Starlight Theatre Monday night. She
will be replaced by a member of the Starlight company.
   Ms. Brennan, 54, played Capt. Doreen Lewis in the movie and TV
series ``Private Benjamin.''
   In 1982, she was nearly killed when a car struck her as she was
crossing a street in Venice, Calif. She had a skull fracture, and
facial bones and both her legs were broken.
   Pins were inserted in her left leg to help the bones heal, and
she underwent plastic surgery to repair facial injuries.

paying off.
   Paullin, one of the few cast members still alive, has been hired
to help promote the release of the movie's uncut version on video
next month.
   ``I haven't seen it myself, and I can't wait,'' said Paullin, who
at 4 feet, 6 inches is more than a foot taller than he was as a
16-year-old Munchkin.
   It's the first time the movie starring Judy Garland has opened
any doors for him, he said.
   ``It hasn't been until the last six, eight years when the adults
took over and the memorabilia came out. Now is when the Wizard of Oz
is really popular,'' he said. ``Before now it was just a kiddie
show.''
   Paullin is one of three Lollipop Boys who present Dorothy with a
lollipop and welcome her to the Land of Oz.
   Only a few Munchkins are left to tell the tale of sweltering
shooting conditions and the excitement of building one of the first
color movies.

   An 11-year-old California flying a single-engine
plane around the world departed Yakutia in Soviet Siberia on Monday
for the Far Eastern port of Okhotsk, Tass reported.
   Pilot Tony Aliengena, his parents and their entourage received a
warm welcome in Yakutia, capital of the Yakutian Autonomous
Republic, where they visited a diamond cleaning plant, attended a
concert in their honor, and watched a performance of the ancient
Yakutian fairy tale, ``Churumchuku,'' the official Soviet news
agency reported.
   When the 47-day journey is completed, Tony will present a
friendship scroll signed by Soviet youngsters to President Bush, who
has already agreed to meet the youngster at the end of his journey.
   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, began his global flight June 5
from California. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around
the world.
   While flying in the Soviet Union, Tony has been accompanied by a
Soviet navigator because air controllers on many domestic routes do
not speak English, as required on international routes.
   The young Californian's entourage includes a second twin-engine
plane for a U.S. documentary film crew, a publicity agent, a
10-year-old Soviet pen pal, Soviet and American journalists and
world-record observer to verify his attempt to circumnavigate the
world.

<HEAD>Mandela-Botha Meeting `Very Positive Step,' Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government called the
meeting between President P.W. Botha and Nelson Mandela a ``very
positive step,'' but did not say whether the jailed black leader
would be released soon, a newspaper reported Monday.
   Also on Monday, anti-apartheid groups said Mandela is seeking to
release a statement explaining the talks held Wednesday at Botha's
official residence in Cape Town.
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, has drawn up the
statement and submitted it to prison authorities, anti-apartheid
leader Rev. Frank Chikane told reporters in Johannesburg.
   Chikane and Mandela's wife, Winnie, refused to divulge its
contents or say when it might be released.
   The Prisons Service had no comment when asked about the statement.
   Mrs. Mandela met with her husband for an hour Monday at the
Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town, but she refused to answer
questions about it.
   Anti-apartheid activists agree ``that it is best for us to let
the leader (Mandela) speak for himself,'' said Chikane, general
secretary of the South African Council of Churches.
   But, he added, ``Mr. Mandela remains a prisoner of the South
African government and is therefore not free to propagate his ideas.
We do not know whether what he has to say will reach the public
without being tampered with.''
   The Botha-Mandela meeting took the anti-apartheid movement by
surprise. Mrs. Mandela said Sunday she was not aware of the meeting
until after it happened.
   It is illegal to quote Mandela in South Africa, but people who
have met with him in recent years have conveyed his thoughts and his
daughter, Zindzi, read a statement released by him in 1985.
   Minister of Information Stoffel van der Merwe described the
Botha-Mandela meeting as ``a very positive step.''
   ``I wouldn't go as far as saying that the way has been opened for
his release,'' van der Merwe was quoted as saying in The Star, the
country's largest daily newspaper.
   Chikane accused the government of trying ``to use the meeting as
a form of propaganda to give an impression that South Africa is
changing and is negotiating.''
   But, Chikane added, there can be no negotiations between the
white-run government and the 28 million black majority until Mandela
and other political prisoners are released and the ANC is legalized.
   The ANC said Monday the meeting was a ``public relations
exercise.''
   ``It would be wrong for anybody to believe that the meeting
signified the start of negotiations between the black people of
South Africa and the National Party government,'' ANC spokesman Tom
Sebina said from the orgaization's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Nonetheless, the meeting _ the first between Botha and Mandela _
was front-page news in South Africa and reignited speculation that
Mandela may soon be released after more than 27 years in prison.
   Mandela, 70, was transferred in December from Pollsmoor prison in
Cape Town to the Victor Verster prison farm, where the conditions of
his imprisonment were eased and he was allowed to stay alone in a
prison warder's house. He is serving a life sentence for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Botha and other members of the ruling National Party have hinted
in recent months they would like to find an acceptable formula to
release Mandela.
   Botha has suggested the government could modify its demand that
Mandela make an outright renunciation of violence before his release.
   Mandela has said he will not disavow violence until apartheid is
dismantled and the ANC made legal again.
   The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily, said the
African National Congress expected ANC leader Walter Sisulu to be
freed before parliamentary elections Sept. 6, and Mandela and other
political prisoners to be released after the elections.

   Burglars broke into the London home of the brother
of the Sultan of Brunei and stole $6.5 million worth of jewelry and
cash, police said today.
   Thieves broke in through a first floor window of the house in the
north London district of East Finchley on Thursday in the late
afternoon or evening, said Detective Superintendent David Staff of
Scotland Yard.
   Details of the robbery had been kept secret at the sultan's
request, police said.
   The red-brick house is owned by the sultan's youngest brother,
Prince Jefri, a spokesman for the sultan said, and not by the sultan
himself as The Daily Express, The Daily Telegraph and the domestic
news agency Press Association had earlier reported.
   The sultan is the richest man in the world.
   Staff said the prince's wife, Princess Norhayti, was not home at
the time of the robbery.
   ``No physical violence'' was involved, the officer said, and the
thieves had ``no contact'' with any of the household staff or
security guards. He would not elaborate. Nor would he say whether
the house had been ransacked or if selected items were taken.
   Family lawyer Fred McColl said additional security measures have
been installed, but he would not give details. Asked whether former
employees are being questioned, he replied, ``We are questioning a
number of people.''
   Newspaper reports today said the gang must have had intimate
knowledge of the complex security systems and alarms in the house.
   Brunei, on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo, is rich
in oil and natural gas and the revenues go to the sultan, Sir Muda
Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izuddin Waddaulah, 42, who is also prime
minister and defense minister.
   The sultan's country of less than 250,000 people is a member of
the 48-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies. His
personal fortune is estimated at more than $23 billion.
   The British robbery record is an estimated $48 million from a
safe deposit center in 1987 in London's Knightsbridge district. The
center's owner, Parvez Latiff, and three other men were convicted of
the crime in January and jailed.

   The United States still has serious
reservations about admitting Marxist-led Angola to the International
Monetary Fund, a State Department spokesman said Monday.
   Richard Boucher appeared to rebut published reports that the Bush
administration would switch its vote and favor Angola's admittance
to the IMF as a gesture of appreciation for the recent decision by
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to open negotiations with
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Boucher called dos Santos' decision to meet with Savimbi a
``significant step toward national reconciliation,'' but said the
United States would not reward the government before the process is
complete.
   ``The United States continues to have serious reservations about
admitting Angola to the IMF,'' Boucher said. ``We have no intention
of establishing diplomatic relations with Angola before national
reconciliation is achieved.''
   The Angolan government had hoped that opening negotiations with
Savimbi together with the withdrawal of Cuban forces would lead to
full diplomatic relations with the United States.
   The IMF executive board has voted to admit Angola, a step the
United States alone could not block.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says Namibian Independence on Track</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior U.S. official for African
affairs said Monday that Namibia's independence plan is on track but
that Pretoria and the South-West Africa People's Organization should
ease tension in the territory.
   Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, spoke after talks with Namibia's South African
administrator, Louis Pienaar, and the U.N. representative to the
territory, Martti Ahtisaari.
   Cohen said Namibia's yearlong independence process has passed an
``irreversible threshold.'' He siad he is pleased with the ongoing
repatriation of Namibian refugees and registration of voters for
November elections.
   However, he warned South Africa and the South-West Africa
People's Organization that they are not doing enough to reduce the
suspicion that developed during their 23-year bush war.
   The guerrilla organization accuses the territory's South
African-controlled police force of intimidating its supporters in
northern towns and villages where it draws most support.
   ``We took very seriously the complaint of the U.N.
secretary-general (Javier Perez de Cuellar) about the excessive use
of force in northern Namibia and the abuses by the police force,''
Cohen told a news conference.
   He called on South African officials to work on ``defusing the
rather tense situation'' in northern Namibia.
   He also noted South Africa is uneasy because many guerrillas have
remained at camps in Angola rather than return to Namibia as
civilians.
   ``I would urge SWAPO to repatriate former members as soon as
possible so they can be here as civilians and voters rather than in
Angola as sequestered fighters,'' he said.
   South Africa agreed to end its 74-year rule of Namibia under a
regional peace agreement in exchange for the repatriation of 50,000
Cuban troops in Angola.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization is expected to win
the elections. No date for independence has been set, but it is
expected early next year. More than 5,000 U.N. monitors are
overseeing the process in Namibia.

   Two leading Chinese dissidents who escaped to the
West told a newspaper the June 4 crackdown was a massacre ``100
times crueler'' than the Cultural Revolution.
   ``The cruelty of Deng Xiaoping goes way beyond that of Mao
(Tse-tung) and Chiang Kai-shek,'' university professor Yan Jiaqi was
quoted as telling Le Monde newspaper.
   ``The massacre of June 4 was 10, 20, 100 times crueler than the
Cultural Revolution.'' During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
``people were suppressed with clubs, whereas today, they use tanks
and rifles to gun down the crowd,'' Yan said. He is former director
of the Beijing Institute of Political Studies.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi was quoted as saying 2,000 dead was
the ``most prudent figure'' for the number of demonstrators killed
when troops marched on Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   Yan and Wu'er are wanted by the Chinese government for
``counterrevolutionary crimes.'' They have been in hiding in France,
where the press has published unconfirmed reports they are awaiting
papers to go to the United States.
   China formally protested to France on Friday, calling the two
``criminals.'' It said their activities on French soil aim at
overthrowing the Beijing government and therefore granting them
asylum is ``a gross interference'' in China's internal affairs.
France froze relations with Beijing after the June 4 crackdown.
   Wu'er described to Le Monde the June 4 scene:
   ``I saw the army arrive with rifles in the northern sector of the
square and, row by row, decimate the students. About a dozen fell at
a time.'' In one section alone, he said, there were 200 victims.
   Yan was quoted as saying Deng, China's senior leader, ``behaves
like an emperor.''
   In another interview, published by Der Spiegel newsmagazine in
West Germany on Monday, Yan said thousands of executions could
follow. Twenty-seven people have been executed in China since June
4, some student leaders and others common criminals.
   ``Deng now will, so I believe, have thousands of people killed,
first the students, then the intellectuals,'' Der Spiegel quoted Yan
as saying.
   ``The persecution will now be directed against all progressive
people who stand up for freedom and democracy,'' he said.

   The Solidarity signs along Warsaw's streets
show that much has changed since George Bush visited two years ago;
the long lines outside poorly stocked stores show that much has not.
   The once-banned flags of the independent labor organization now
are commonplace. But Polish citizens still must wait, often for
hours, to buy essential goods.
   Amid the contrasts, Bush halted his motorcade on Monday to shake
the hands of people lining the city's streets.
   ``In these hardships, there is someone we can count on,'' said
Elzbieta Laskowska. As Bush worked the crowd _ only 4,000 or so
strong _ she clutched paper U.S. and Polish flags in one hand and
shook Bush's hand with the other.
   ``We have real friends in America. ... Friends are found when one
needs them,'' she said, quoting a Polish saying.
   ``It makes it easier to persist and go on,'' Barbara Araszawska
said after seeing the president.
   But even as they applauded Bush _ ``We hope he makes Poland the
51st state,'' joked one man _ the Polish people acknowledged that
the United States will not alone lift their country from the
economic slide that forces them to wait hours to get into stores
with little stock. They face more belt tightening as the standard of
living falls further and further behind the rest of Europe.
   A retired shoe factory worker who identified herself only as
Helena commented:
   ``What's going on here is very good. ... We won't be able to get
over our crisis without others' help. But if we don't get to work,
no one is going to help us overcome our problems.''
   Even as economic hardships persist, however, Polish society is
becoming more open.
   Solidarity now has 260 members in the 560-seat parliament. One of
the songs with which the crowds serenaded Bush was the union's
anthem, ``Solidarity. Solidarity.''
   In the crowds that turned out to greet Bush were Poles wearing
Solidarity T-shirts or carrying shopping bags emblazoned with the
logo of the independent trade union banned for seven years until
historic reform accords reached by the communist government and the
opposition in April.
   ``As a Solidarity activist, only half a year ago I was not
allowed into an enterprise where I had business to do and now I am
employed there and I am a deputy to the Polish parliament,'' Zbignie
Kaminski, an economist, remarked as he awaited Bush's speech to the
only freely elected national legislative body in Eastern Europe.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, another member of parliament and a
Solidarity spokesman, sat near Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
Communist Party leader, at a luncheon Bush gave at the U.S.
ambassador's residence and commented on the union's dramatic change
in fortunes, which were strongly supported by the United States.
   ``This is rather strange when you think a year ago I was in
prison,'' Onyszkiewicz said after dining on minted cantaloupe soup
and roast tenderloin of beef.
   Earlier in the day, about 4,000 people gathered as Bush and his
wife, Barbara, laid a wreath of flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier.
   At Umschlagplatz, the square on the edge of the one-time Warsaw
ghetto where more than 300,000 Jews were loaded onto trains bound
for the Treblinka gas chambers in 1942 and 1943, the Bushes were met
by Poland's lone rabbi, Menachem Jaskowitz, and by Marek Edelman,
the last surviving commander of the Jewish ghetto uprising of April
1943.
   Edelman said later he had told the president that ``rich America
must sometimes give a chunk so that the world can become free, so
that these things do not happen again.''

   The $500 million B-2 stealth bomber
revved its engines and taxied across a desert runway at up to 100
mph Monday, operating under its own power for the first time.
   The Air Force pronounced the tests of the sinister-looking,
black-and-gray flying wing a success and said high-speed tests of
the radar-evading nuclear bomber would be conducted later this week
with a view toward its first flight soon afterward.
   ``You've got a lot of firsts here today,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``You have the first time under its own power, you have it
turning. All this has only been done before on computer
simulations.''
   The sleek, boomerang-shaped strategic bomber rolled from its
super-secret research hangar and taxied back and forth on an
11,000-foot runway at Air Force Plant 42, the crucible through which
virtually all Air Force aircraft pass.
   ``I love it,'' said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Tess Taft, waving
an American flag.
   Three taxi tests at different speeds stopped traffic on Sierra
Highway next to the plant and offered the first unobstructed view of
the craft since it was unveiled for the news media on Nov. 22.
   At approximately $500 million each, the plane is the nation's
most expensive and controversial, joining the nation's arsenal
during a period of increasing Pentagon budget cuts.
   The stealth is designed to drop nuclear bombs and fire cruise
missiles and evade radar and infrared detection.
   Despite delays that have plagued the B-2, Brig. Gen. Richard
Scofield, B-2 program director, said, ``Everybody in the Air Force
is convinced that we are working the schedule the right way. We are
making sure the plane works right for when we do the hazardous
testing, and flight test is hazardous.''
   Tests on the B-2 took place in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave
Desert where the space shuttle was built and where test pilot Chuck
Yeager first broke the sound barrier in 1947.
   For weeks, people fascinated with the eerie manta-like aircraft
have parked nearby, hoping for a glimpse. On Monday, the dozen or so
regulars got an eyeful.
   The plane rolled out of its hangar shortly after sunrise and
stayed in view of highway onlookers for three hours. Periodically,
its engines ran at various pitches and decibels, sometimes blowing a
lonesome whistle across the desert, sometimes accelerating up to a
dull roar.

   Police quietly led away 16 people who demonstrated
Monday to protest the seizure of 648 copies of an unofficial human
rights journal.
   At the outset of the evening demonstration in Pushkin Square,
police told organizer Viktor Sergiev the protesters did not have
permission to assemble.
   But the demonstrators were allowed to protest for 30 minutes as
plainclothes police took photographs. Dozens of people paused to
read the protesters' posters and argue with them.
   The demonstrators then formed a line and followed a uniformed
officer around the corner to a small police station. Police did not
interfere with a reporter and photographer covering the event.
   The demonstrators were released after four hours, according to
one group member, who said it appeared that no criminal charges
would be brought.
   Before the demonstration began, Sergiev said the group was
protesting the seizure of 648 copies of Ekspres Chronika from a
woman as she tried to distribute them to passers-by in the square
Friday. The four-page weekly, which was founded on Aug. 1, 1987, is
distributed free of charge in Moscow and 40 other cities, he said.
Five-thousand copies are printed weekly, he said.
   The editor of Ekspres Chronika, psychiatrist Alexander
Podrabinek, received an award in May for his human rights
activities. The award, the Koryagin Medal, is named after Anatoly
Koryagin, a psychiatrist jailed in the 1970s after he testified that
an independent trade union activitist was not insane, angering
authorities.
   Podrabinek also served time in jail and was freed in 1987. He was
not present at the demonstration.

   The Solidarity signs along Warsaw's streets
show that much has changed since George Bush visited two years ago;
the long lines outside poorly stocked stores show that much has not.
   The once-banned flags of the independent labor organization now
are commonplace. But Polish citizens still must wait, often for
hours, to buy essential goods.
   Amid the contrasts, Bush halted his motorcade on Monday to shake
the hands of people lining the city's streets.
   ``In these hardships, there is someone we can count on,'' said
Elzbieta Laskowska. As Bush worked the crowd _ only 4,000 or so

   Anti-government Polish demonstrators
shouting ``down with Communism'' greeted President Bush Monday as he
arrived for a formal state dinner hosted by the Communist Party
chief, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The demonstrators, who also chanted ``Jaruzelski Must Go,'' could
be heard among the 1,000 people outside Radziwill Palace when the
Bushes arrived.
   It was the first protest of Bush's visit to Eastern Europe, which
began Sunday night, and appeared to have been staged by splinter
opposition groups.
   The Bush motorcade pulled straight into the palace driveway and
there was no indication if he heard the chants or saw a sign
reading, ``Poland, like the United States, has a right to be
independent.''
   The dinner was held in a green marble ballroom on the second
floor of the reconstructed 17th century palace used most recently
for the ``round-table'' reform talks between the Solidarity-led
opposition and the communist government.
   Among the 100 guests were political leaders and members of the
opposition, including three top Solidarity trade union advisers.

   Thousands of Iranians turned out for an
anti-Saudi Arabia rally Monday, the second anniversary of fatal
riots by Iranians in Mecca, and Iran's president said Saudi
government officials were terrorists.
   The developments deepened a growing rift between Iran's Shiite
Moslem government and the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia as both
countries prepared for major religious events this week.
   ``The Saudi regime which massacres in cold blood hundreds of
pilgrims near Allah's safe house is a terrorist,'' Tehran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying.
   Saudi officials say Iranian fundamentalists caused the July 10,
1987, riots in which more than 400 mostly Iranian protesters died.
Iran says its pilgrims were exercising their legitimate right to a
political protest in Mecca, birthplace of the prophet Mohammed.
   In Saudi Arabia on Monday, King Fahd called for heightened
security around the annual Moslem pilgrimage, or hajj, to the
shrines in Mecca and Medina, apparently fearing Iranian-instigated
trouble.
   Tehran Television, monitored in Nicosia, showed thousands of
Iranians converging on the Imam Hussein square in downtown Tehran
chanting: ``Mecca and Medina should be liberated!''
   Thursday marks the end of the 40-day mourning period for
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3. The planned final mass
outpouring of grief at his grave coincides with the climax of the
pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, the Eid al-Adha, or feast of sacrifice.
   Iran claims the pilgrimage is being corrupted and has boycotted
it for the second straight year.
   Last year the Saudi government also introduced a quota system
limiting the number of pilgrims to 1,000 per million of population,
effectively cutting the usual Iranian contingent of 150,000 to about
50,000.
   Fahd's call for tighter security came days after a Saudi
editorial rebuked Iran for introducing politics into a religious
festival and for keeping its people away from the hajj, one of the
five duties of all Moslems.
   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April last year,
citing subversion and terrorism.
   The Shiite-Sunni rift evolved from the bloody 7th century fight
over who would succeed Mohammed, founder of Islam, as leader of the
religion.

   Two Palestinian teen-agers were shot and killed
by Israeli troops Monday in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and two others died of wounds suffered in earlier clashes, the army
and Arab reports said.
   The army also said an armed Arab guerrilla was killed over the
weekend near the West Bank city of Hebron but gave no details.
   Ten other Palestinians were shot and wounded Monday in clashes
with troops in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials said.
   The latest deaths raised to 557 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 19-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Thirty-five Israelis, including 12 killed in a bus
attack Thursday, also have died in the violence.
   The army said its army tanks and infantry carried out a raid
north of Israel's security zone in Lebanon near the village of
Zillaya in an area controlled by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem militia.
   The announcement said the area was used to stage attacks on
Israeli forces. It said the army ``detained suspects and brought
them for investigation'' to the security zone.
   The village is about 11 miles northwest of the border, outside
the six- to 10-mile zone Israel set up in Lebanon in 1985 to protect
its northern border.
   In another action outside the security zone, the army said, the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia killed three Palestinian
guerrillas near Hasbaya, about six miles northwest of the border. It
said there were no militia casualties.
   The Palestinians killed in the occupied territories Monday
included Rami Mustafa El-Tarisi, 15, who was fatally shot in the
chest in a stone-throwing clash in the Bureij refugee camp in the
Gaza Strip, Arab reports said. The army said it was checking.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, 17-year-old Yasser Abu Ghosh
was fatally shot in the head and back by Israeli security men who
arrived in a civilian vehicle, Palestinian reports said.
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified under military
regulations, said security forces tried to arrest the youth and
opened fire when he refused orders to halt.
   The spokesman described him as a member of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO, and said
he was wanted for ``attacks on collaborators and as a senior
coordinator of violent actions in the area.''
   Two youths died of wounds suffered earlier:
   _ Iman Awadallah, 13, was hospitalized three days earlier with a
bullet wound in the stomach sustained in a clash in his hometown of
Rafah in the Gaza Strip. He died in Barzilai Hospital near the
Israeli town of Ashkelon, Arab reports said.
   _ Mahyub Musa Khalil, 14, was shot in the head with a rubber
bullet during a raid on the Palestinian village of Tormos Aya near
the West Bank town of Ramallah late Sunday night, the army said. He
died in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital.
   The so-called rubber bullets, actually rubber-coated steel balls,
were introduced by the army as less lethal than standard ammunition,
but they can kill when fired at close range.
   Israeli authorities on Monday identified the final two victims of
the crash on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway caused by a Palestinian
man who grabbed the bus's steering wheel and plunged the vehicle
into a 200-foot ravine.
   Both victims were Israel: Emil Gruzman, 54, an immigrant from the
Soviet Union, and Menachem Ezrahi, 63 a retired Tel Aviv policeman.
   Two Canadians died in the crash, and 27 other people were
injured. The Palestinian, a passenger, was arrested and was
hospitalized in an Israeli prison.

<HEAD>Foley Says Congress Won't Vote Federal Pay Hike Without a Share</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Monday that
President Bush's proposals to raise pay for judges and top
executive-branch officials cannot win approval without a link to
higher pay for members of Congress.
   Foley said he prefers there to be no connection, but he suggested
his view is not widely shared on Capitol Hill.
   ``There will be ... no disconnection between judges and the
executive branch and Congress,'' he said. ``The underlying reality
of that, in my judgment, is that the votes do not exist to do it.''
   The House speaker, D-Wash., commented at a luncheon with
executives and reporters of The Associated Press
   Any congressional increase would have to meet a
``reasonableness'' test _ unlike the failed 51 percent pay hike
sought early this year _ and would have to be supported by both the
House and Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, and by party
political operatives as well as leaders such as Bush, he said.
   Foley said that even though the previous pay raise idea was
supported by two Republican presidents, the Democratic-controlled
Congress was politically mauled by Republican campaign operatives.
   ``I don't want to get into something where the president says
yes, and the congressional campaign committee says no,'' Foley said.
``That's unacceptable, that sort of good-cop, bad-cop routine.''
   And Foley repeated past criticism of media coverage of the
pay-raise issue, saying the public was not well informed about the
last raise attempt and was whipped into opposition.
   If there is a similar atmosphere the next time, ``if it's a `here
they go again' sort of thing ... beating up on the Congress, I'm not
going to put (lawmakers) through that,'' he said.
   Bush has so far proposed pay increases for judges and for senior
executive branch officials. He has said he will work with Congress
toward a pay raise but has not submitted a plan for boosting
lawmakers' pay.
   The matter of top federal pay scales remains far down the agenda
as Congress returns this week from its Fourth of July recess. Foley
said much of this month will be spent in passing ``all or close to
all'' of the 13 appropriations bills, the annual money measures that
provide the funding for most government programs.
   As for other priorities for the rest of the year, Foley listed
savings and loan bailout legislation, a military spending bill,
budget trims to meet deficit targets, child care and clean air
measures, and family leave and minimum wage bills.
   On other topics, Foley said:
   _ He still plans to resist any immediate attempt to amend the
Constitution to bar flag desecration, preferring to try first
putting the protective language into law. ``It would be wise to
start with a statute. It is unwise to rush into a constitutional
amendment, especially in the heat of this issue. ... I'm not going
to change my mind about that, obviously.''
   _ Bush gets relatively high marks so far in his conduct of
foreign affairs, having reasserted U.S. leadership in NATO, having
struck a proper balance in the U.S. response to China's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators and having increased consultation with
Congress. Bush's challenge now is keeping alive political and
economic change in Eastern Europe without causing destabilization,
he said.
   _ The bitter partisan mood that surrounded his predecessor, Jim
Wright of Texas, has largely been left behind with Wright's
departure. ``The mood ... is to have a more conciliatory and
mutually respecting environment,'' he said. ``I don't think Jim
broke the rules (in his treatment of Republicans) but I think we
pushed the rules to the edge of the envelope, and that helped to
break down the sense of comity'' in the House.

   Two agricultural leaders from Israel and Egypt
were recognized Monday by the Agriculture Department for their part
in cooperative programs aimed at improving world food production.
   Recognition went to Egypt's Mohamed M. Dessouki, first
undersecretary for agricultural development of the ministry of
agriculture, and Prof. Samuel Pohoryles, director general of rural
planning and development in Israel's ministry of agriculture.
   They were among more than 40 cited by the department's Office of
International Cooperation and Development. Most work for the agency.
   Other outsiders cited for efforts in international programs
included: Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.; John ``Jack'' Jordan and
John Warren, both of Texas A&amp;M University; and Thomas F. Trail of
Washington State University.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said at the agency's
ceremony that ``it's not hard to defend'' programs that enable
countries to cooperate in research and development projects.
   ``We ought to support them for humanitarian motives alone,''
Yeutter said. ``For those who find that difficult to do, for
whatever reason in terms of budgetary priorities, it seems to me we
can also defend them very readily in terms of economic
self-interest,'' he said.
   Yeutter added: ``We, the developed world, benefit from economic
development in the developing countries.''

<HEAD>Young Former Governor Leads Presidential Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll released Monday said
Fernando Collor de Mello, a 39-year-old former state governor who
leads a new party, holds a 3-1 lead over his nearest rival four
months before the presidential election.
   The former governor of Alagoas state, in the poor northeast, was
preferred by 39 percent of those interviewed, said the Brazilian
Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics.
   Leonel Brizola, former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, was
second with 13 percent, followed by socialist labor leader Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva with 7 percent.
   Brazilians are to vote Nov. 15 for a successor to President Jose
Sarney, who cannot succeed himself. The term is five years.
   It will be the first direct presidential election since 1960,
when Janio Quadros won. The military seized power in 1964 and
relinquished it in 1985.
   Collor de Mello's small National Reconstruction Party was founded
only this year. He rose in the polls from 7 percent in March to 20
percent in April and has led since.
   His rating of 39 percent was slightly below the 43 percent of a
month earlier, but Carlos Augusto Montenegr, director of the polling
institute, said the change was not significant because no other
candidate's performance rose substantially.
   The latest sampling was of 3,753 people in 255 cities questioned
between June 29 and July 5, the institute said, and the margin of
error was 2 percent.
   Brizola's rating was 13 percent, up from 11 percent. The former
leftist firebrand, who represents the Democratic Labor Party and now
projects a more moderate image, is widely considered Collor de
Mello's main competition.
   In 1982, Brizola came from a similar distance back in the polls
to win the Rio governorship.
   Da Silva's position began to erode early this year because of
strikes led by labor groups linked to his radical Workers Party.
   Other candidates include Rep. Ulysses Guimaraes, former speaker
of the House of Represenatives, from the centrist Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party; Sen. Mario Covas of the center-left
Brazilian Social Democracy Party, and wealthy businessman Paulo
Maluf, the 1985 presidential candidate of the military's Democratic
Social Party. Each got 5 percent in the polls.
   Responses to other questions in the survey indicated Brazilians
worry most about unemployment, inflation, health care and education
in that order.
   The popularity of Collor de Mello, a businessman, is considered a
sign of dissatisfaction with Sarney, whom he often criticizes. The
59-year-old president has been unable to curb 1,000 percent annual
inflation, and allegations of corruption in his government arise
frequently.
   As governor of Alagoas, Collor de Mello caught the nation's
attention by refusing to pay state workers known as ``maharajahs''
who had attained high salaries through corruption. The campaign
against such employees spread to other states and has been the core
of his presidential campaign.
   Opponents claim Collor de Mello appointed thousands of civil
servants in his home state and was overly generous in settling a tax
dispute with Alagoas sugar barons.

   Riot police restored order at a jail camp
rife with racial tension Monday after a three-hour uprising left
nine people injured and several buildings in ashes, authorities said.
   The uprising at the county-run, minimum- and medium-security
Banning Rehabilitation Center began late Sunday when officers were
inspecting a mostly black, 55-man barracks, said Riverside County
sheriff's Capt. Jake Bowser.
   The inmates were standing outside the building when Hispanic
inmates from a neighboring barracks ``started pummeling them with
rocks and other debris,'' said Bowser.
   ``When the corrections officers tried to intervene they were
pummeled, too,'' he said.
   Tim Lewis, who lives across the street, said he heard a ``large
explosion, like a sonic blast.'' Flames leaped high into the sky
over the camp and about 15 minutes later a power pole exploded and
plunged the camp into darkness, he said.
   The inmates gave up the battle when officers in riot gear
entered. No shots were fired. ``I think when we opened the gates
with our gear on it got their attention and they complied with our
orders,'' said Bowser.
   Seven inmates were injured in the melee, including two with stab
wounds, and two prison officers suffered minor injuries.
   The kitchen, commissary, work-release center and an operations
building housing corrections officers' lockers were burned, as were
three smaller buildings, three trucks, a county car and a sheriff's
patrol car, Bowser said.
   Bowser had no estimate of damage Monday but said workers were
setting up temporary kitchens to feed inmates. The camp, with a
784-inmate capacity, held 766 inmates, including 113 women, when the
riot erupted.
   ``There were definitely racial overtones,'' Bowser said.
   Inmate Diane Mason, interviewed as she was receiving oxygen in an
ambulance, said she was talking to her boyfriend through a fence
when she heard people yell that there was a fight in the
minimum-security area.
   She said people came running out of the commissary throwing
things. ``All of a sudden a big old fire blazed up out of nowhere,''
Mason said.
   Earlier Monday, helicopters using search lights illuminated the
surrounding land as law officers looked for any escapees. A head
count revealed no inmates were missing, said Bowser.
   About 300 inmates were sent to other jails in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, Bowser said. Those who remained were locked in
their barracks.
   ``They are real subdued now and I'm sure they aren't happy, but
we had to do this to control the situation,'' Bowser said.
   The jail camp is 90 miles east of Los Angeles.

   Here is a state-by-state glance at details on fires in the West:
   _Arizona: Fires had burned more than 40,000 acres of forest and
range land through the weekend. The largest fire, along the New
Mexico state line, had burned 14,500 acres but was 98 percent
contained.
   _California: A fire in rugged, roadless terrain in the Big Sur
had blackened 2,140 acres and was 50 percent contained. One man was
killed by a falling tree. In Lassen County, in northeastern
California, a 4,600-acre brush fire that destroyed seven buildings
and burned four firefighters was 60 percent contained. In Southern
California, about 100 campers evacuated because of a 3,600-acre fire
in the Cleveland National Forest 60 miles east of San Diego.
   _Colorado: Crews battled more than two dozen fires covering
several thousand acres of dry timber and brush in central and
western Colorado. A 1,760-acre fire believed to be arson destroyed
at least 49 homes and other structures in Boulder Canyon west of
Denver and forced the evacuation of more than 200 people near
Sugarloaf Mountain.
   _Idaho: Eight smokejumpers and two 20-member ground crews battled
a 150-acre fire in the Payette National Forest.
   _Nebraska: A fire near Crawford burned 50,000 acres of pine and
brush in an area 22 miles long by 8 miles wide. It threatened to
burn westward into a rugged, remote area where firefighting would be
more difficult.
   _New Mexico: A fire that has charred 10,025 acres since it
started June 30 in the Gila National Forest was about 95 percent
contained.
   _Oregon: Crews completed fire breaks Monday around three fires
that burned more than 2,000 acres of pine and fir on the Malheur and
Fremont national forests.
   _Texas: A lightning-sparked fire that started Saturday in the
center of Big Bend National Park was 95 percent contained after
charring about 150 acres.
   _Utah: Crews were close to containing a 15,500-acre fire despite
rough, remote terrain near the Colorado line. Near Roosevelt,
firefighters were unable to contain a week-old, 4,800-acre fire in
the Ashley National Forest.
   _Wyoming: Light rain late Sunday helped cool off a 3,447-acre
fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, in western Wyoming, and
firefighters said they were close to completing a containment line
around it.

   A bolt of lightning led authorities to a
marijuana growing operation.
   Lightning started a fire early Sunday at a home, where
firefighters and investigators found about 80 marijuana plants in
the basement, said sheriff's Sgt. Bob Kruse.
   ``You could smell it right away,'' said volunteer Fire Chief John
O'Connor. ``It was quite a setup he had.''
   The 47-year-old resident of the home was arrested on a charge of
possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, Kruse said. The
suspect was taken to St. Vincent Hospital for smoke inhalation and
was listed in fair condition Monday.
   Lightning struck the home and followed wiring to the basement,
blowing a fuse box off a wall and starting the fire, O'Connor said.
Investigators worked Sunday to remove the potted plants and growing
equipment from the basement.
   The plants could have produced at least $40,000 worth of
marijuana, said sheriff's Sgt. Gaylord Baudhuin.
   He said the operation had more than $2,000 in equipment,
including reflectors, timers and ventilating fans. The walls were
paneled with silver-coated insulation to reflect light onto plants.
Lights were operated by timers.

<HEAD>Rebels Release 3 Mayors, Say They Will Spare Norwegian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas on Monday freed three
kidnapped mayors of northwestern towns and reportedly promised to
spare a Norwegian anthropologist who they earlier said would be shot.
   A helicopter pilot abducted in October also was released,
according to a source.
   Mayors Jesus Vasquez of Cocorna, Nevardo Ramirez of San Carlos
and Francisco Javier Castano of San Francisco were released Monday
morning in their northwestern state of Antioquia, said a news
release by the Cocorna City Hall.
   The mayors were kidnapped on Friday by the National Liberation
Army guerrilla movement, which has abducted 53 people this year,
including mayors, reporters and coal and oil industry workers.
   The Concorna statement said the three had been released so they
could deliver a message to Antioquia state about the government's
oil policies.
   Guerrillas want Colombia to nationalize foreign oil operations in
the country.
   The guerrilla group kidnapped the Norwegian anthropologist, Bruce
Olson, in October while he was working with tribes in eastern
Colombia, along the border with Venezuela.
   The guerrillas said last week in a statement sent to newspapers
and radio stations that Olson had been tried and found guilty of
exploiting Indians.
   The respected Bogota daily El Tiempo said Monday the guerrillas
also had accused Olson of killing hundreds of Indians. The newspaper
did not give a source for its report.
   The Spanish news agency EFE said it had talked with the
second-in-command of the National Liberation Army, Nicolas
Rodriguez, in a remote part of the northwest state of Antioquia.
   Rodriguez promised that Olson would be turned over to the
International Red Cross as soon as details could be worked out, EFE
said.
   The guerrillas said they would release Olson because of the many
requests to spare his life, EFE said.
   Olson's mother, in a statement from her home in San Diego,
Calif., appealed last week for the guerrillas to not kill her son.
El Tiempo published the appeal.
   Indian leaders, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church and
government spokesmen have asked the guerrillas not to kill Olson.
   A helicopter pilot who had been flying for foreign oil companies
also was released Monday, a source with a foreign oil company told
The Associated Press. The source identified the pilot as Cornelio
Gonzalez.
   The National Liberation Army has bombed the country's main oil
pipeline 24 times this year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of
gallons of oil being spilled and the loss of millions of dollars of
export revenue.
   The minister of mines and energy, Oscar Mejia, has rejected all
suggestions of negotiation with the rebels and has said the army
should deal with the rebels.
   Representatives of oil companies met in the town of Tibu along
the Venezuelan border over the weekend and issued a statement asking
the guerrillas to stop attacks on the oil industry while attempts
are made to arrange negotiations.
   Sen. Felix Salcedo, who attended the meeting, told a news
conference Monday in Bogota that the guerrillas said they would
consider the request.

<TEXT>
   Sophisticated blood testing techniques
developed by the Centers for Disease Control will enable scientists
to provide better data on whether Agent Orange sprayed on trees in
Vietnam is having adverse health effects on veterans, a panel of
experts told a House subcommittee Monday.
   Controversy has ranged for years over whether the government is
responsible for a variety of health problems reported by Vietnam
veterans who assert their problems were caused by exposure to Agent
Orange.
   A majority of scientists maintain there is no established link
between the kind of exposure to dioxin that occurred in Vietnam and
health hazards.
   On the other hand, veterans' groups argue there is no other
explanation for cancers and birth defects reported by Vietnam
veterans.
   A panel appearing before the Veterans Affairs hospitals and
health care subcommittee agreed that the blood test now being used
to measure dioxin levels in the blood gives researchers a better
tool to determine whether people who fear they suffered
health-threatening exposure to dioxin actually did so.
   Dioxin is the main ingredient in Agent Orange and has been linked
to various cancers and birth defects in rats _ although not
conclusively in humans.
   Dr. Vernon N. Houk, director of the Center for Environmental
Health and Injury Control at the Atlanta-based CDC, told the
subcommittee the test _ developed about three years and just now
coming into wide use _ can detect dioxin in the blood of farm
workers who have not been exposed to the chemical in 30 years and
thus will be an accurate measure of exposure levels in Vietnam
veterans.
   Houk said development of the test ``made a whole new ball game
for us. It really let us clarify how much people were exposed.''
   He said the CDC is in the process of applying the test to 2,000
blood samples of Vietnam veterans and will be finished by next
March, when it expects to issue a definitive report.
   He said the test costs about $1,000 for each sample and that his
staff of 16 can perform about 50 a week.

   Syrian shellfire sank a Greek-owned tanker
that delivered oil to besieged Christians on Monday, and aides said
army commander Michel Aoun has decided to order air strikes to break
Syria's sea blockade.
   Christian Gen. Michel Aoun refused to specify his plans Monday.
But, when asked if a naval confrontation was imminent, he said:
``Everything is possible and we shall use the means in our
posession.''
   Aoun decided on the bombing runs against U.S. advice that he
avoid escalating hostilities and undermining Arab League peacemaking
efforts, his aides said on condition of anonymity.
   From the bunker of his shell-ravaged presidential palace, Aoun
told reporters: ``We have no aggressive intentions. But the Syrians
are escalating their acts of piracy in our waters and in
international waters.''
   An Aoun aide said that after four months of the blockade, the
general ``can't take the Syrian naval siege anymore. He's going to
try to break it by force, using the air force.''
   Aoun has three old British-made Hawker Hunter jet fighters and
eight French-made Gazelle helicopter gunships in operation.
   His aides say Syria has six gunboats patrolling offshore, as well
as sophisticated MiG-23 fighter-bombers. Syrian jets in the past
have been shot down by Israeli warplanes, which patrol Lebanese
airspace and claim Lebanese skies are within Israel's sphere of
influence.
   Aoun's decision was reported as gunners from the Syrian Army and
Aoun's mainly Christian Lebanese Army dueled with howitzers and
rockets, and street gunbattles between rival Shiite Moslems ebbed
into sporadic sniping.
   In south Lebanon, Palestinian and leftist Lebanese guerrillas
attacked Israeli troops patrolling with allied Lebanese militiamen.
Three guerrillas were killed in the shootout, police said.
   Aoun's aides said the 54-year-old general decided to use the air
force against the Syrian navy last week, when gunboats were deployed
to tighten the four-month-old blockade.
   They said Aoun communicated his decision to ambassadors of the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China,
France, the Soviet Union and the United States.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy, however, prevailed upon Aoun to
postpone the strikes, according to aides.
   ``But with Syrian gunboats now intercepting various ships heading
for the Christian coast almost daily, the general is brushing aside
the American ambassador's advice,'' the aide said.
   Gunboats have intercepted a fuel tanker and three cargo ships
carrying food in the past two days and taken them to Lebanon's
Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli, Aoun's aides reported.
   A Lebanese yacht with six men aboard was seized by two Syrian
gunboats before dawn Sunday after it sailed from Kaslik Christian
harbor. It was escorted to Syria's northern Tartus naval base, they
said.
   Police said Syria attacked the Maltese-registered tanker, Aloil,
after it unloaded its cargo of gasoline at the Christian port of
Jounieh. All eight crewmen were rescued.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit, which
monitors maritime activity, said the Aloil sank. It said the vessel
is owned by Alco Shipping Co. of Piraeus, Greece.
   At least five other cargo vessels have been hit by Syrian
shellfire since the siege was imposed March 14. A Turkish sailor was
killed and an Indian sailor was missing and presumed dead.
   Also Monday, a Syrian gunboat intercepted the Santa Maria
hovercraft that has been running the gauntlet of Syrian shellfire to
ferry besieged Christians to Cyprus. The ferry, en route from
Jounieh to Larnaca, was held for two hours.
   Syria's military command did not comment on Aoun's reported
decision. About 40,000 Syrian troops are stationed in Lebanon. They
have violated a 1976 Arab League mandate by siding with Moslems
against the Christians, who have 20,000 troops.
   Two people were killed and five wounded in the overnight exchange
of shellfire in Beirut and north Lebanon, police said. This raises
the toll to 405 killed and 1,581 injured since the Syrian-Christian
confrontation broke out March 8.
   Syrian troops who police west Beirut were deployed Monday in
Ouzai and Jnah residential districts to try to disengage warring
militiamen of the pro-Syrian mainstream Shiite Amal and
Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The troops restored traffic between Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Amal and Hezbollah are vying to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the country's largest sect.

<HEAD>Burglars Loot London Home of Sultan's Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burglars stole $6.5 million worth of jewelry and
cash from the London home of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, whose brother is
a sultan considered to be the world's richest man, police said
Monday.
   The intruders entered through a first-floor window of the red
brick house in the north London district of East Finchley late in
the afternoon Thursday or in the evening, said Detective
Superintendent David Staff of Scotland Yard.
   Police said details were being kept confidential at the sultan's
request.
   Prince Jefri is the youngest brother of the 42-year-old sultan of
Brunei, who has 37 words in his name and title but is generally
called Sir Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan is worth an estimated $30
billion and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the
world's richest man.
   Staff, the detective superintendent, said the prince's wife,
Princess Norhayti, was not at home when the robbery occurred.
   ``No physical violence'' was involved, he said, and the thieves
had ``no contact'' with any of the household staff or security
guards. He would not elaborate. He also would not say whether the
house had been ransacked or if selected items were taken.
   Fred McColl, the family's lawyer, said additional security
measures had been taken but he would not give details. Asked whether
former employees were being questioned, he replied: ``We are
questioning a number of people.''
   Newspaper reports said the gang must have had intimate knowledge
of the complex security systems and alarms in the house.
   Brunei, on the northwest coast of Borneo, is rich in oil and
natural gas and the revenues go to the sultan, who also is prime
minister and defense minister. It is a former British protectorate
and became fully independent on Dec. 31, 1983.
   Britain's record robbery was of an estimated $48 million from a
safe deposit center in London's Knightsbridge district in 1987. The
center's owner, Parvez Latiff, and three other men were convicted of
the crime last January.

<HEAD>Black Priest to Seek Reconciliation With Catholic Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE RUMSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest who defied Roman Catholic authorities
by forming a congregation emphasizing African-American traditions
will present a reconciliation plan by early next week, a spokeswoman
said Monday.
   However, the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr. said in a statement
that any discussion with the Archdiocese of Washington ``must take
place on our terms and must affirm our right to religious,
spiritual, liturgical and theological self-determination.''
   Spokeswoman Gloria Nurse said Stallings is drafting the plan this
week.
   The Rev. William Lori, spokesman for Cardinal James Hickey, said,
``Father Stallings should communicate directly with the cardinal's
office about his desire to be reconciled with the Catholic Church.''
Lori said he had not seen Stallings' statement.
   Lori has said repeatedly the church hopes for a reconciliation.
   Hickey suspended Stallings after the priest conducted the first
service of his new Imani Temple July 2. Suspension means Stallings
does not have church sanction to say Mass or perform other priestly
duties.
   Stallings has said he would like to see formation of an
African-American Catholic Rite that would recognize the authority of
the pope but give individual priests greater control over the
Catholic liturgy and other matters.
   His new statement said, ``Any conversation with the archdiocese
will and must include among other issues the integrity of
African-American worship style (and) the development of an
indigenous African-American clergy and leadership.''
   Stallings, 41, also said he will seek ``full participation of
African-Americans in the archdiocese decision-making process.''
   He has said he formed Imani Temple last month because the
Catholic Church has failed its black parishioners. He has also
charged the church with racism.
   After services that drew more than 2,000 people to a suburban
high school auditorium Sunday, Stallings said he would try to hold
reconciliation discussions within 30 days.
   If he returns to the church, his followers must have ``the rights
to determine who we are and what we are on our own terms,''
Stallings' statement said.

<TEXT>
   Financial markets stabilized
Monday in response to new austerity measures imposed by President
Carlos Menem to reduce 1 million percent annual inflation and a
massive budget deficit.
   Meanwhile, in his third day in office, Menem moved forward in
another sensitive area, the military, by replacing the air force and
army chiefs.
   ``We had no other choice, no other resource,'' Menem said in
reference to economic measures announced Sunday night that devalued
the national currency by one-half and increased gasoline prices by
as much as 610 percent.
   ``We've never found ourselves in such a difficult situation,''
said Menem, who was inaugurated Saturday.
   ``There was no other possibility for the Argentine Republic,'' he
said.
   The plan also envisions cutting back drastically on government
spending, selling many state-run industries, reducing subsidies and
tax breaks for private companies and enforcing widely ignored tax
laws.
   ``From what I see, people are reacting well so far,'' Menem said.
   On Monday, monthly interest rates dropped to 18 percent as
investors put their money in banks and bonds rather than in dollars.
Heavy speculation on the dollar forced interest rates to 200 percent
a month in June.
   Under the austerity measures, the Central Bank _ Argentina's
equivalent to the Federal Reserve _ ordered a 53.7 percent
devaluation of the austral currency, setting its value at 655 per
dollar, compared with 303 per dollar on Friday.
   The devaluation brought the austral into line with the black
market and was intended to encourage exporters to sell foreign
currency to the Central Bank, which has low cash reserves.
   As part of Menem's economic program, gasoline prices went up
610.5 percent and electricity and telephone fees rose by about 200
percent, the government news agency Telam said.
   Traffic on Buenos Aires streets was lighter than usual Monday
morning, an indication that some commuters had abandoned their cars
in favor of public transport.
   Natural gas prices will rise 640 percent for businesses and 200
percent for homeowners. Economy Minister Miguel Roig, who announced
the measures, did not say when those rates would take effect.
   Fares for buses, subways, commuter trains and airplanes were
expected to double on July 17, government spokesmen said.
   The measures are aimed at reducing inflation that in June soared
by 114.5 percent _ an annual rate close to 1 million percent _ and
narrowing a budget deficit estimated at 12 percent to 15 percent of
the gross national product.
   The former government of President Raul Alfonsin financed the
deficit _ caused in large part by operating losses at state-run
companies _ by printing money or borrowing abroad.
   Neither avenue is open to Menem, who was elected May 14. The
nation is $4.5 billion in arrears in interest payments on the $60
billion foreign debt; the austral, valued at 18 per $1 in February,
has lost 97 percent of its value in five months.
   Inflation and devaluations touched off a recession in which real
wages have fallen by at least 35 percent this year and unemployment
has climbed to 10 percent.
   Workers would be shielded somewhat from the effects of Menem's
austerity measures by controls on the prices of milk, bread and
other basic commodities, and a small, one-time pay increase this
month, Roig said. The pay increase, which will go to salaried
workers and retirees, amounts to 8,000 australs, about $12.
   But there still appears to be the danger of social unrest.
   Labor unions denounced price hikes in the past weeks, and hungry
shantytown dwellers looted food stores again last week in Rosario,
the country's third-largest city.
   Roig said the only solution was a free-market policy in which the
private sector would provide services now offered by the government.
   Legislation will be sent to Congress to give Menem sweeping
authority to privatize state companies, Roig said.
   Defense Minister Italo Luder said Gen. Isidro Caceres will
replace Gen. Francisco Gassino as army chief of staff, and Brig.
Jose Julio will replace Brig. Ernesto Crespo as head of the air
force.
   Caceres negotiated an end to the December military revolt led by
Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin at the Villa Martelli barracks.
   The navy chief and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will
also be replaced soon, Luder said.

<HEAD>Army Moves 20 Armored Personnel Carriers Near Noriega Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT AMADOR, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. forces said Monday they deployed
armored cars and helicopter gunships at a base near one of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's offices to bolster security after a bullet
hit a U.S. colonel's home. Sunday's show of force came a day after a
bullet smashed through a second-story window at the home of Col.
Jorge Torres, penetrated a wooden door and dropped to the floor less
than one foot from his son's bed, the U.S. Southern Command said in
a statement.
   No one was injured, but Torres and his wife were ``shaken up,''
the statement said.
   It said the bullet was fired from a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle and
came from the vicinity of Chorillo, a Panama City neighborhood
across a belt of water from the Fort Amador compound.
   ``U.S. authorities have verbally protested the incident because
of its obvious threat to the safety of the U.S. families and
children who are residing at Fort Amador. The incident is being
investigated,'' the statement said.
   ``The exercise (Sunday) was intended to test U.S. responsiveness
as well as reassure the families at Amador of our ability to protect
them,'' it said.
   Panamanian defense force spokesmen refused immediate comment on
the incident.
   Panama's defense forces have their headquarters in Chorillo, but
Noriega also maintains an office at Fort Amador, a facility the
countries share under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties.
   Noriega commands Panama's defense forces and is the country's de
facto leader.
   The Southern Command statement said helicopter gunships and
armored personnel carriers of the 5th Infantry Division were
deployed at Fort Amador for several hours Sunday. President Bush
sent in 5th Division units in May after the Noriega-controlled
government annulled elections the opposition appeared to be winning.
   Saturday's incident was the latest in a series that has
contributed to growing tensions between U.S. and Noriega forces.
   Pro-Noriega demonstrators blocked the entrance to a U.S.
installation for half an hour last week, and a U.S. general said
Friday he thought Washington should impose a military solution to
remove Noriega.
   Noriega's office at Fort Amador overlooks a U.S. naval station
and is across the street from a supply and intelligence
headquarters. He must pass U.S. military police posts to get to the
building.
   The Panamanians also use the fort as a training area and
headquarters for several units. Gen. Omar Torrijos, who became a
national hero when he signed the treaties returning the Panama Canal
to Panamanian control at the end of 1999, is buried on the grounds.
   Washington has imposed economic sanctions on the Panamanian
government in an effort to remove Noriega since he was indicted on
drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   Noriega says the charges are trumped up and part of a U.S. plot
to renege on the canal treaties.

<HEAD>Magazine Says Soviets Should Have Broadcast US Moon Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet space writer said in an article
published Monday the Kremlin made a mistake by not broadcasting live
television coverage when the U.S. Apollo 11 mission landed on the
moon July 21, 1969.
   ``Late on the night of July 21, 1969, on central television, if
my memory doesn't trick me, they broadcast the program, `Pages of a
Musical Spectacle,''' Yaroslav Golovanov wrote in this week's
edition of the magazine Ogonyok.
   ``At that same moment, all of mankind was holding its breath for
the first landing of man on the moon.''
   Soviet television carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the
U.S. Apollo and Soviet Soyuz capsules in 1975, but largely ignored
the American program to land on the moon.
   By doing so, Golovanov wrote, ``we showed a lack of respect for
the astronauts, for that country ... and for ourselves. Our people
know about the Apollo program by hearsay, and are always amazed when
they hear that 12 men have landed on the moon.''
   ``It is never too late to correct a mistake. Today, 20 years
after the first steps on the moon, I want to recount the history of
Apollo 11 and its crew,'' Golovanov wrote in the first of a series
of articles to appear in Ogonyok. The magazine has been in the
forefront of glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
greater openness.
   The article, illustrated with black-and-white photographs, gave
the biographies of the three crew members _ Neil Armstrong, Edwin
``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael Collins _ and described the flight of
the ``Eagle'' lunar landing module.
   The most dangerous moment of the flight, Golovanov wrote, came
when Armstrong took manual control of the module for the final
descent.
   With tens of millions of television viewers around the world
watching a live broadcast, Golovanov wrote, Armstrong set the craft
down safely and ``man had landed on the moon. A bold and ancient
dream had come true.''
   Ogonyok did not indicate the scope of the articles to follow.

   The State Department on Monday welcomed last
week's meeting between South African President P.W. Botha and
imprisoned black nationalist Nelson Mandela.
   The department urged the South African government to free Mandela
and take other steps to create a climate for peaceful negotiation of
the country's problems.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher termed the Botha-Mandela
meeting ``symbolic recognition by the South African government of
the important role Nelson Mandela and other black leaders will have
to play in the search for a peacefully negotiated solution to South
Africa's problems.
   ``We hope the South African government will take steps to create
a climate in which such negotiations can take place,'' Boucher added
to reporters.
   ``These would include release of Mandela and all political
prisoners, the lifting of the bans on political organizations and
the lifting of restrictions on other political leaders.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Apples Donated May Have Alar Traces, But Will Be Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apples to be donated to charity in a $15
million bailout of growers may contain traces of Alar but will
nonetheless be safe to eat, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   ``We are simply not going to be poisoning people,'' said Arthur
Whitmore, a department spokesman. ``They may or may not have Alar in
them, but our position is that these apples are safe. There is no
reason not to eat apples.''
   The department announced Friday it would spend up to $15 million
in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus of apples created when
consumers stopped buying amid fears over the use of Alar.
   As originally envisioned, the department would have purchased the
apples outright and then donated them to schools, prisons, public
assistance food programs and others.
   The department now plans to have the growers donate the apples to
various groups and then be reimbursed by the department.
   ``We would never formally take possession of the apples,'' said
Whitmore, adding that such programs are designed to ``correct market
distortions involving surplus quantities of commodity.''
   The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of
apples from last year's crop, valued at between $40 million and $56
million, remain unsold with this year's harvest only weeks away.
   The department said that prices had fallen $3 to $4 per carton
from what they were a year ago and the nation's 20,000 apple growers
have estimated total losses at well over $100 million.
   Alar is used to enchance apple color, ease of harvesting and life
in storage.
   The Alar controversy began in late February when a private
environmental advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said eating apples treated with the chemical substantially increases
the risk of cancer in children.
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration disputed the environmental group's report as a major
exaggeration of the risk, but sales fell immediately.
   Even though EPA criticized the study, the agency plans to ban the
use of Alar next spring and in the interim has proposed slashing the
allowable limit on crops from 20 parts per million to one part per
million.
   The only manufacturer has withdrawn Alar from the U.S. market.
   Paul Allen, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said Monday that his group was ``not endorsing, nor
opposing'' the Agriculture Department's bailout.
   ``An individual bite of an apple or a sip of apple juice that may
have a trace of Alar is not a great cause for alarm,'' said Allen.
``The public health threat from Alar involves prolonged exposure.''
   Republican Rep. Sid Morrison, an apple grower whose central
Washington state district produces roughly half of the nation's
apples, said Monday that even though many of the apples that will be
donated through the USDA program may have traces of the Alar the
levels will be within even the EPA's new proposed limits.

<HEAD>Four From Washington HUD Office Reassigned Pending Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four employees at the Washington field office
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development were reassigned
Monday to the agency's headquarters pending investigations of their
roles in mismanagement officials believe cost the government $10
million.
   The four, including the former head of the field office, had been
placed on 30-day administrative leave at the outset of the
investigation last month but that period expired Monday. HUD
officials exercised their option to place the four on 90-day
temporary assignments.
   They will be assigned, beginning Tuesday, to non-management
positions in four separate offices within HUD headquarters, said HUD
spokesman Robert Nipp. They were notified of the move Monday in
letters from Edwin Gardner, HUD's deputy undersecretary for field
coordination.
   ``The investigation continues,'' Nipp said.
   An audit of the Washington field office uncovered lax financial
and management controls that allowed private closing agents HUD
contracts to handle the sale and acquisitions of single-family
property to delay payments to the government and in some cases not
make required payments.
   Audits of closing agents nationwide found similar problems in
many states, and those audits now are part of a congressional
investigation into allegations of influence-peddling, mismanagement
and other problems at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Secretary Jack Kemp, scheduled to appear before Congress on
Tuesday, said Monday that the agency's problems would not be used as
an excuse to curtail housing programs designed to help low- and
moderate-income Americans.
   ``We're not going to allow it to be a reason to close down the
programs of HUD,'' Kemp said in a brief reference to the scandal in
a speech he made in Detroit to the convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   The four Washington workers reassigned to headquarters were I.
Margaret White, who had headed the District field office for five
years; Robert B. Warner, its director of housing management; Charles
W. Womble, a single-family home loan specialist; and Everett
Rothschild, head of property disposition.
   The field office oversees HUD properties in the District of
Columbia and parts of Maryland and Virginia.
   Among the private closing agents in the region under scrutiny is
Marilyn Harrell, the so-called ``Robin HUD'' who has said she took
$5.5 million that belonged to HUD and donated most of it to programs
to help the poor.
   About a dozen closing agents nationwide may have cost the
government more than $20 million by withholding money owed the
department or sending it in late, costing the government interest,
officials believe.

   Israel's government was thrown into crisis
Monday when senior leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party voted to
recommend leaving the coalition Cabinet, a move that could force
national elections.
   Labor's Leadership Bureau adopted a proposal, which now goes to
the party's decision-making Central Committee, that accused Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of derailing efforts to end the Palestinian
uprising with tough, new conditions set by his Likud bloc, Labor's
coalition partner.
   ``There is no room under these circumstances for the continuation
of the government,'' said Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor
chairman, as he recommended pulling out of the Cabinet.
   His colleagues applauded loudly and passed his proposal 45-2,
with six abstentions.
   Later, Peres predicted elections in a few months.
   ``I assume that the central (committee) ... will discuss when we
want elections,'' he told the national science institute. ``When two
parties come to a situation of disagreement and breaking apart ...
they go for new elections.''
   Labor legislators underscored their anger by walking out of
Parliament Monday when it voted on five left-wing motions of no
confidence.
   The government easily overturned the motions by a vote of 41-12
votes with five abstentions.
   It is the most serious crisis since the government was formed in
December after weeks of negotiations with small religious parties.
The Tel Aviv stock market dropped 4 percent at the news.
   But Labor leaders gave themselves room to maneuver, hinting they
might not withdraw if real progress was made to arrange peace
negotiations with Palestinians before next month's meeting of their
1,350-member Central Committee.
   Shamir, in a placatory effort, said he will call for a vote at
Sunday's Cabinet meeting to reaffirm support for the government
peace initiative, Israel television reported.
   Labor and Likud, which have ruled jointly since 1984 elections
ended in virtual deadlock, have survived several ideological crises.
   Some Labor leaders said a final decision could hinge on next
week's visit by three U.S. State Department officials and whether
they will make any progress toward starting an Israeli peace
dialogue with Palestinians.
   Israeli reports said Secretary of State James A. Baker III had
asked Labor leaders through Ambassador William Brown to refrain from
leaving the government, fearing this would mire U.S. efforts.
   Labor's decision sparked anger in Likud. Shamir called Labor's
vote ``a mistaken decision'' and said dissolving the Cabinet will
leave ``no choice than to hold early elections which are not needed
by the country at this moment.''
   ``The prime minister's bureau stresses and reiterates that the
government peace plan is still alive,'' a communique from his office
said.
   The statement also accused Labor of ``playing into the hands of
the Arabs ... and relieving the Arabs of any need to respond to the
peace initiative.'' The Palestine Liberation Organization so far has
rejected the plan.
   Shamir has said he agrees with conditions adopted by his party
July 5, but that the tough stances are not binding on the peace
iniative, which calls for elections among Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Those elected are to negotiate with Israel for autonomy, with
later talks deciding the territories' final status.
   Peres, the government vice premier, argued in a fiery speech that
Likud's stance torpedoed the peace plan. Labor's No. 2 man, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said the plan had been ``castrated.''
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the only Arab country that has
signed a peace agreement with Israel, said in Cairo the tough new
conditions could undermine Shamir's entire peace proposal.
   Peres especially criticized Likud's demand that proposed
elections be postponed until the uprising is ended. At least 555
Palestinians and 35 Israelis have died in the 19-month revolt.
   ``What does that mean? Granting veto power to all the extremists
in the territories. We shouldn't block negotiations just because the
terrorists don't want them,'' Peres shouted.
   He also objected to Likud's demand to continue building Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories and its rejection of the
U.S.-backed formula of trading ``territory for peace.''
   The three-hour meeting ended with Labor's Central Committee
recommending: ``That following the decisions of the Likud Central
Committee that harmed the changes of the government's peace
initiative, there is no room ... for the continuation of the
government.''
   More than 60 leaders in the 120-member bureau stayed away from
the vote, but Peres expressed confidence the Central Committee would
vote to pull out unless steps are taken to rescue the peace plan.
   If Labor's 11 ministers quit the 26-member Cabinet, Shamir could
technically form a narrow government with religious and right-wing
factions. But he said he expected new elections.
   According to opinion polls, Likud stands a good chance of
repeating its victory over Labor in the last elections in November
1988, when it got 40 seats to Labor's 39 in the 120-member
Parliament.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas Monday killed 20
people and injured 51 others in rocket attacks on the capital that
also destroyed a key weapons depot, the government said.
   The Soviet-backed government said guerrillas were preparing a
mid-July offensive on Kabul and provinces, and that government
forces may shell neighboring Pakistan, where many of the
U.S.-supported guerrillas are based.
   The Supreme Military Council was to determine how to respond to
the latest shelling, which began at midnight Sunday and hit seven of
the city's 11 districts, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi
Amani said.
   Diplomatic sources said Afghanistan may issue an ultimatum to
Pakistan to restrain the guerrillas or face military action.
   At the United Nations, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said
Pakistan was planning a new rebel offensive.
   ``Materialization of this aggressive plan will oblige us to take
decisive and serious measures,'' Wakil said in a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   In Kabul, Amani said: ``Our armed forces have the capacity to
shell similar rockets on Pakistan territory.''
   Amani also said government troops killed 208 guerrillas in an
operation against guerrilla bases in the Ghazi Abad and Chaprhar
areas in Nangarhar province, site of the deadliest battles in the
decade-old civil war.
   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan news agency called the Kabul
government claims ``baseless.''
   ``The reports we received were that three mujahedeen were killed
in bombings at Ghazi Abad,'' the agency's Qaribur Rehman Saeed said
in Islamabad, Pakistan. The guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen,
or Islamic holy warriors.
   The provincial capital of Jalalabad, between Kabul and the
Pakistan border, has been under guerrilla siege since the last of
the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan on Feb. 15. Red Army
soldiers backed the Marxist government in Afghanistan for nine years.
   In Monday's attacks, one rocket hit a downtown bus station,
killing at least eight Afghans waiting to board a bus, witnesses
said on condition of anonymity. A second rocket struck a tailor's
shop and killed two people, witnesses said. A third hit the Kabul
Hotel, but no casualties were reported.
   It was not immediately known how the remaining 10 people were
killed.
   The missile attack came several hours after a guerrilla rocket
blew up an ammunition and weapons depot near the airport. The
government barred reporters from visiting the depot.
   Amani said the airport warehouse housed only flares used by
aircraft to deflect the heat-seeking Stinger missiles supplied by
the United States to the guerrillas. But a U.N. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said the explosion caused ``substantial
loss.''
   ``Soviet-supplied small arms and artillery and other ammunition
are stored in the depot before they are dispatched to army units in
the provinces,'' he said.
   The blast and subsequent fire shortly after midnight rattled the
city of 2.25 million people and threw glowing shrapnel into the
night sky for two hours before turning into a towering column of
smoke.
   The guerrilla's Afghan News Agency in Islamabad said its gunners
hit the Soviet Embassy in Kabul with 122mm cannon fire Thursday,
killing eight people and wounding six. The report could not be
confirmed independently.
   The agency said it did not know whether the injured were Soviet
nationals. ``We are not sure. The person who told us said they were
just employees'' at the mission, said agency spokesman Abdut Malik
Alnoor.
   Monday's report also claimed the presidential palace was hit,
killing 22 government soldiers.
   At the United Nations, a Soviet Foreign Ministery statement
Monday made no mention of the alleged embassy attack but said that
on July 2 a missile exploded near the embassy. The statement made no
mention of casualties.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers speculated Monday that former
Premier Andreas Papandreou will marry his 35-year-old girlfriend,
Dimitra Liani, this week.
   Ethnos, a liberal daily, said the wedding would take place
Thursday at the St. Marina church in Ekali. Most reports agreed on
the date, but some differed on the church.
   Papandreou, 70, and Ms. Liani, a former Olympic Airways flight
attendant, live in Ekali, a northern suburb of Athens.
   The former premier's divorce from his American-born wife of 38
years, Margaret, became final three days before the June 18
elections. His open affair and a series of banking and financial
scandals contributed to the Socialist leader's failure to win a
third term in office.
   He and Ms. Liana were expected to marry soon after the elections,
but the wedding apparently was delayed by Papandreou's
hospitalization last month with pneumonia and kidney failure. He has
since recovered.
   Ms. Liani has been accused in the press of exerting pressure on
government ministers and creating a ``court'' around Papandreou that
isolated him from his friends and four children.

<HEAD>Veteran Comedian Tommy Trinder Dies At Age 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Tommy Trinder, whose nimble, irreverent
wit endeared him to generations of Britons, died Monday at age 80.
   His death was announced by the show business charity
organization, The Water Rats, which he led in 1955, 1963 and 1965.
   It said Trinder died at St. Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, just
west of London, after a long illness. The nature of the illness was
not disclosed.
   Thomas Edward Trinder was born March 24, 1909, the son of a
London streetcar driver. He made his London debut at age 13 at the
old Collins Music Hall.
   By 17, he was principal comic in touring revues put on by Archie
Pitt, to whom comedian Gracie Fields was once married.
   Trinder became a favorite at London clubs, theaters and dance
halls, and in 1938 made the first of many appearances at the
Palladium. During World War II he entertained British soldiers all
over the world, and later toured the United States.
   He appeared on the popular TV program ``In Town Tonight'' and the
long-running British Broadcasting Corp. radio panel game ``Does The
Team Think?'' and was host of Independent Television's ``Sunday
Night at the London Palladium.''
   Trinder's movie credits included ``The Foreman Went to France''
in 1942 and ``Fiddlers Three'' in 1944.
   Queen Elizabeth II made Trinder a commander in the Order of the
British Empire in 1975.

<TEXT>
   The conservative National Action Party won the
recent Tijuana mayoral election, strengthening the opposition's hold
in Baja California state, according to official results announced
Monday.
   The victory by Carlos Montejo Fabela confirmed the heavy losses
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party suffered in the
state in the July 2 elections. At that time the party, known as the
PRI, lost its first gubernatorial race in its 60-year history to
National Action.
   The PRI confirmed it lost the race in Tijuana, across the
U.S.-Mexico border from San Diego, according to Notimex, the
government news agency.
   Partial results announced by the state electoral commission also
showed that National Action won in all six Tijuana legislative
districts.
   Montejo Fabela said National Action lost the mayoral race in
Mexicali and Tecate. The party has claimed victory in Ensenada.
   The PRI has never lost a presidential election; it suffered its
first Senate losses in elections a year ago.
   Partial results in western Michoacan state _ where the PRI lost
ground in last year's vote _ showed the PRI won six of 18
legislative seats and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party won
two, the Excelsior news service said.
   The PRI on Monday tried to play down its losses.
   The party's secretary-general, Rafael Rodriguez Barrera, said its
losses in Baja California ``do not have an important significance
for the PRI,'' Notimex reported.
   ``What is important is the capacity for recuperation to
compensate for the defeats and this has been done on several
occasions,'' Rodriguez Barrera said.
   The PRI in recent years has increasingly maintained its hold by
vote fraud.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has struck several
dramatic blows against fraud and corruption since taking office Dec.
1, had promised clean elections.
   The opposition, however, has accused the PRI of fraud in the
latest elections.

   About 700 puppeteers gathered Monday to

   ``We're all here to try to keep it going,'' said Ms. Rains, 34, a
former zookeeper who abandoned work on a doctorate in veterinary
physiology for the more creative rewards of puppeteering.
   The 49th annual Puppeteers of America National Festival, held on
the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, covers just
about anything a puppeteer would want to know. The Puppeteers of
America, based in Pasadena, Calif., has just 2,000 members.
   In workshops and performances, puppeteers demonstrate their
techniques and learn the history of puppetry. The convention, which
runs through Saturday, also has a room filled with puppets,
marionette kits, videos of puppet shows, puppet wigs and even puppet
postcards and puppet coloring books.
   Part conference and part theatrical marathon with daily puppet
shows, the festival is also a social occasion bringing puppeteers
together from across the country.
   ``It's a very isolated profession,'' said Ms. Rains, who with her
husband, Stu Janis, put on a 19th century version of ``Punch and
Judy'' in schools, shopping malls and art fairs around Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minn., near their Maplewood home.
   ``Puppeteers are usually very driven, creative people,'' said
Nancy Laverick, director of the festival. ``You've brought life to
something, then emotion.''
   Unlike Asia and Europe, where for centuries puppetry has
enlivened religious practices while entertaining and educating, the
United States remains largely an empty stage when it comes to
puppets.
   Yes, there was Kukla, Fran and Ollie, and any puppeteer will
credit Jim Henson and his Muppets with giving puppetry a boost.
   But there are only about two dozen full-time puppet troupes akin
to the puppet theaters of Europe and Asia, according to Janet
Bradley, 46, of Tears of Joy Theatre in Vancouver, Wash.
   Her shows, based on folk stories and myths, are performed largely
for schoolchildren.
   ``For me, these stories speak to us, about life and death, not
wanting to grow up and about growing old. I want to bring it to
life,'' she said. ``This is real and alive and happening. That's the
essence of good theater.''

   Damaging winds and large hail hit New York, Vermont and
Massachusetts on Monday, and showers and thunderstorms drenched
parts of the South and the Rocky Mountains.
   Thunderstorm winds downed trees in Schenectady, N.Y., Montpelier,
Vt., and Williamstown, Mass., and toppled power lines in Albany, N.Y.
   Winds gusted near 60 mph in Middleburg, N.Y., and Northfield,
Mass. In West Boylston, Mass., officials said they received reports
of a tornado after high winds swept through the area, knocking out
power and telephones, felling trees and damaging homes. Main roads
into the town were blocked, officials said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Ping pong ball-size hail pounded Stephentown, N.Y., and
golfball-size hail fell in Montpelier.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also scattered across parts of the
Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys, the western Gulf Coast and
the Rockies.
   Hot, humid weather prevailed south of a cold front from the
central and southern Plains to the south Atlantic Coast. Readings
were in the upper 80s and 90s throughout much of the area.
   Temperatures climbed above 95 degrees in much of northern
Illinois, parts of northeast Kansas, northeast Iowa and southeastern
North Carolina.
   The weather was cooler and less humid to the north of the front.
Early afternoon temperatures were in the 70s and 80s from the upper
Great Lakes to the northern Plains. Milwaukee, Wis., dropped from 90
degrees to 77 degrees in just 13 minutes as the cold front moved
through the area.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees in Arcata, Calif., and Bremerton, Wash., to 101 degrees in
Needles, Calif.
   The nation's low was 29 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Tuesday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the
mid-Atlantic coast and northern Maine; widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms along the south Atlantic coast, the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys and the Texas coast; and isolated showers
and thunderstorms over Utah and Arizona.
   High temperatures in the 90s were predicted for much of the
nation; the 70s and 80s for northern New England, the Great Lakes,
the northern Plains, parts of the northern Rockies, the Pacific
Northwest and coastal sections of California; and between 100 and
110 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has gone from
fixing electric carts at the Lenin Shipyard to leading the strongest
opposition movement in the history of the Soviet bloc.
   On Tuesday, the Walesas, Lech and Danuta, are having special
guests for lunch at the house they moved into just last year:
President Bush and his wife Barbara.
   Walesa repaired his last shipyard cart early this year before
entering talks with communist authorities that led to the
legalization of Solidarity in April after a seven-year ban and its
landslide win in last month's elections.
   Now the 45-year-old Walesa works in an office at the newly opened
Solidarity national headquarters.
   ``I am fond of him,'' Walesa said Monday of Bush. ``He is a
high-class politician, a great intellect, quite straightforward, a
fantastic president.''
   The union leader also expressed his admiration for Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, describing him as a ``fantastic juggler.''
   ``I admire Mr. Gorbachev,'' Walesa said on NBC news. ``He is
truly a great juggler of great class, it's such a gigantic country
with such problems. He has to be a great juggler to make it.''
   Walesa and Bush met during the then-vice president's trip to
Poland in 1987, when they conferred at the U.S. Ambassador's
residence in Warsaw and together visited the grave of murdered
pro-Solidarity priest the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko.
   The Solidarity chief and 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate has
begun to assume the trappings of the globe-trotting statesman and
political leader he is. He occasionally refers to himself as ``we.''
   But the father of eight retains a knack for the common touch.
   That touch will be much in evidence when the Bushes arrive for
lunch at 54 Polanki Street in Gdansk, not far from the crowded
high-rise apartment block where the Walesa family used to live.
   The meal will be a private affair between the Bushes and the
Walesas; the only other person in attendance will be an interpreter
who will be working, not eating.
   Like any other guest, the Bushes will enter the Walesa house
through the back door, walking through the kitchen on the way to the
dining room.
   Walesa is proud of the house he purchased and renovated last year
with earnings from his autobiography, ``A Way of Hope.''
   A stuccoed brick single-family house that would raise no eyebrows
in the United States or Western Europe, it is a dwelling that many
Poles would regard as a palace compared to their typically cramped
apartments.
   It has a garden and small orchard where Walesa will take Bush for
a stroll, and space enough for a home office filled with mementoes.
   Walesa also has a satellite dish to pull in foreign television
broadcasts on his color television.
   The dining room is decorated with paintings of nature scenes and
religious themes. In the living room hangs a portrait of Polish-born
Pope John Paul II. ``My highest authority,'' Walesa calls him.
   When Walesa was traveling the country last fall meeting workers
in the aftermath of a wave of strikes, he sometimes had to explain
the house to followers who feared he was putting on airs.
   ``Look, I wrote a book,'' he would answer. ``I have eight kids.''
The explanation usually sufficed.
   After lunch, Bush will visit the workers' monument outside the
Lenin shipyard, where Solidarity was born in August 1980.
   Danuta Walesa, 39, has put her friend Grazyna Pusz in charge of
cooking for the Bushes. Mrs. Pusz's husband Krzysztof is Walesa's
longtime assistant.
   The menu includes simple and wholesome Polish dishes, in an array
that should make the Walesas' table groan.
   Appetizers will include smoked salmon and smoked eel, the latter
a Gdansk specialty, and a tray of Polish cold cuts.
   ``Chlodnik,'' a cold summertime soup made from beets and sour
cream, and mushroom soup will be next, with the main course to
include turkey, veal, pork with mushrooms, beef and new potatoes.
   Dessert will be a jelly made from wild strawberries, chocolate
cake and a strawberry pie.
   Mrs. Walesa said she planned to ``just be sitting, doing nothing
and enjoying being the guest. ... I trust my friend.''

   President Bush, in a day of high symbolism
and support for Poland's strides toward democracy, offered on Monday
a modest economic aid package intended to help ``redeem the promise
of a free Polish republic.''
   A key element is a $100 million U.S. fund _ provided Congress
approves _ to support the Polish private sector as the Soviet bloc
country moves away from its Marxist economy.
   But the dimensions of the U.S. offer could fall short of Lech
Walesa's aspirations. The leader of the Solidarity trade union
movement is expected to ask Bush on Tuesday when they meet in Gdansk
to back a $10 billion program of international help for Poland.
   Even so, a clearly exhilirated Bush assured the Polish
parliament, where Solidarity holds 260 of 560 seats, that ``the
Western democracies will stand with the Polish people, and other
peoples of this region.''
   Although interrupted by applause five times and given a standing
ovation at the end of his speech, Bush encountered little more than
a correct response from the parliament and a tepid reception on the
streets of Warsaw.
   The 4,000 or so people that watched Bush's 12-car motorcade drive
through the streets of this sweltering city waved small paper
American flags listlessly. Occassionally, there were shouts of
``Long life. Long life.''
   The president wound up his busy day as guest at a state dinner
hosted by the Communist Party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
Striking much the same tone as in his speech to parliament, Bush
said in a toast that Poland was entering a new era and was
``beginning, once again, to command its own destiny.''
   For his part, Jaruzelski said in his toast that the Polish
government does not want to ``return to old resentments and
emotions'' in its relations with the United States, but hopes to
``look into the future, to construct a sort of `bridge' across the
Atlantic.''
   As the president's motorcade arrived at Radziwill Palace for the
dinner, demonstrators among 1,000 people outside could be heard
shouting ``down with Communism'' and ``Jaruzelski must go.''
   There was no indication whether Bush could hear the protests,
which appeared to have been staged by splinter opposition groups.
   Jaruzelski, in an interview with ABC news, praised his meeting
with Bush, saying: ``It was a very rich day, rich in substance, rich
in political facts.''
   He also said he consulted with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
and added: ``I really am heartened that the leaders of the two big
powers are guided by the same intentions and I feel that this bodes
well for the future.''
   Earlier, Bush squeezed in a short pitching session with Polish
Little Leaguers.
   Handing his dark suit jacket to his wife, Barbara, the president
put an orange fielder's glove on his right hand and powered a
baseball to a 12-year-old Polish pitching star on the back lawn of
U.S. Ambassador John Davis's residence.
   ``Make sure, he doesn't throw it wild, and wipe my wife out,''
Bush, the captain of the 1948 Yale University baseball team, told
his security guard as Adam Szczepanski returned the president's
offering with equal force.
   The well-attended session was designed to support the development
of America's national pastime in this European country.
   As for the offer of financial assistance, Bush:
   _Pledged to ask Congress for a $100 million ``enterprise fund''
to support Polish entrepreneurs. Moreover, he said he will ask other
industrialized democracies to undertake similar initiatives at this
weekend's western economic summit meeting in Paris.
   _Said he would also ask Congress to approve $15 million to fight
air and water pollution in Krakow, once the royal capital.
   _Promised to open a U.S. educational and cultural center in
Warsaw. Poland, he added, should do the same in the United States.
   _Told the parliament he would ask his six summit partners to
quickly support rescheduling of up to $5 billion of Poland's
staggering international debt of $39 billion.
   _Said he would encourage the World Bank to proceed with $325
million in loans to help Polish agriculture and industry ``reach the
production levels that they are clearly capable of.''
   But Bush stressed that the aid would come with a string attached
_ that Poland would have to adopt austerity measures.
   ``There can be no substitute for Poland's own efforts,'' he said,
telling the parliament, ``I must speak honestly _ economic reform
and recovery cannot occur without sacrifices.''
   Bush told the parliament that Poland must choose either a free
market economy or socialism. ``Your responsibility for your
country's future is immense,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski, acknowledged as much in introducing Bush to
parliament.
   ``We are fully aware that the biggest work is up to us ourselves.
... But we do not want to be alone,'' the general said.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told Bush the speech
``contained many thoughts permeated with realism.'' Foreign Minister
Tadeusz Olechowski said his nation was not looking for ``a rain of
gold''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a news conference the
primary objective of the U.S. aid package is to lower Polish
inflation from its current 100 percent and to ease government
subsidies for heavy industry.
   Baker said that Bush, in devising his package, ``recognizes there
will be some trying times ahead'' for Poland in meeting U.S. and
international standards.
   Bush himself cautioned parliament that the United States would
not provide ``unsound credits made without regard to the necessary
reforms.''
   Two years ago, the parliament withheld its support from an
austerity program that would have meant increases of 100 percent or
more in rents and food prices.
   Addressing the parliament, Bush also sought to inspire Polish
reformers.
   He said that, now, ``this generation's calling is to redeem the
promise of a free Polish republic. Poland has not been lost so long
as the Polish spirit lives.''
   Earlier, in a speech at a luncheon with Jaruzelski, who is
playing a pivotal role in restructuring the Polish economic and
political systems, Bush called on both the party and Solidarity ``to
rise above the mistrust'' and work together to meet common
challenges.
   ``The United States will stand with Poland,'' Bush declared. ``We
will support Poland's hopeful mission, unparalleled in your
history.''
   Bush also paid his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,
then visited the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, bowing his head in
tribute to the once-vibrant Jewish community that was annihilated
after standing virtually alone against the World War II Nazi
occupation.
   A rabbi, in the black kaftan of the Hasidic movement, quietly
said a prayer as tears streamed down the cheeks of a handful of the
remnants of Polish jewry.
   Bush's visit to Poland is the first stop on a 10-day trip to
Europe that includes the first-ever visit by an American president
to Hungary. He also will travel to Paris for a seven-nation economic
summit and stop briefly in the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
   U.S. author Marianne Wiggins says she lives ``the
life of a paranoid schizophrenic'' since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called on Moslems to kill her novelist husband Salman
Rushdie, according to a report published Monday.
   ``Suddenly, I have been removed from the world and made into this
person alienatd in the extreme,'' she was quoted as saying in an
interview in the August issue of Options, a monthly woman's magazine.
   Ms. Wiggins and Rushdie have been in hiding under police guard
since Khomeini issued the death call on Feb. 14. The leader of
Iran's Islamic revolution said Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' blasphemes the religion.
   Anne Cabron wrote that she interviewed Ms. Wiggins by telephone
and did not ask where she was.
   ``The thing about this situation is that one is completely of
good mental health and yet living the life of a paranoid
schizophrenic,'' Ms. Wiggins, a native of Lancaster, Pa., was quoted
as saying.
   ``One is always alarmed at strangers,'' she said. ``What has
become impossible is the flow of society. You can no longer pass
down the street and encounter a stranger. You lose all sense of
spontaneity because you live in fear. Fear is an element that used
to be on the far side of the earth.''
   Her latest novel, ``John Dollar,'' was published the day before
Khomeini's death call.
   Ms. Wiggins, 41, who married Rushdie in January 1988, said she
and her husband are keeping diaries and keeping in contact with
their families.

   When Soviet scientists arrived Monday to
formally exchange copies of a scientific agreement with U.S.
scientists, they came bearing gifts.
   The Americans had none and had to scramble to find something to
present their guests.
   Two Soviet geologists attending the 28th International Geological
Congress met Monday at a news conference with Dallas Peck, director
of the U.S. Geological Survey, to initiate formally an agreement to
share geological research.
   The first Soviet speaker, Yeveny A. Kozlovsky, former president
of the USSR ministry of geology, presented Peck with a highly
polished purple stone sphere sitting within a half sphere of
polished green stone. Both stones gleamed with a gemlike quality and
Kozlovsky said they represented the Earth and its core.
   Peck responded with a group of maps, identical to those being
handed out routinely next door in the press room.
   The second Soviet speaker, M.D. Pelmenev, deputy minister of
geology, presented Peck with a cut and polished stone on which a
forest scene had been created using particles of colored gemstone.
   Peck was able to respond with a back copy of a U.S. geology
magazine that had been hastily gathered up by an aide.
   Obviously embarassed by the fact that the Americans had not
prepared for an exchange of gifts, Peck told the Soviets, ``We start
this off by our owing you one.''
   The agreement calls for American and Soviet geologists to
exchange the results of research conducted in their respective
countries. It eventually will lead to an exchange of field trips
that will involve the study of various geological formations in the
two countries. The two countries reached the agreement after two
years of negotiation and the ceremony Monday marked the formal
exchange of copies of the signed agreement.

   Two explosions rocked Mecca Monday,
injuring an unspecified number of Moslems in Islam's holiest city
for an annual pilgrimage, the official Saudi Arabian Press agency
said. The agency made no mention of fatalities.
   The blasts occurred at 10 p.m. One was on the main road leading
to the Grand Mosque of Kaaba, the agency said quoting an
unidentified security official in Mecca. The second explosion was
near an overpass, the agency said.
   The agency indicated the blasts were caused by bombs, but gave no
details.
   An estimated 1.8 million Moslems from more than 80 countries are
in Mecca as part of an annual pilgrimage to the city, the birthplace
of the prophet Mohammed. During the pilgrimage, known as hajj,
Moslems also travel to Medina to visit the tomb of the 7th century
founder of Islam.
   ``This criminal perpetration at a sacred spot is regrettable,''
the Saudi news agency quoted the security official as saying. ``An
investigation is under way and details will be released as soon as
available.''
   It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the
explosions. Iranian extremists have in the past clashed with
security forces in Mecca, near the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia.
   Iran Monday branded Saudi government officials terrorists,
according to Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. In
response, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd heightened security in Mecca and
Medina.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia began limiting the number of pilgrims to
Mecca and Medina based on a country's population.
   The head of the Iranian organization that arranges pilgrimages to
the cities then told Iranians to skip the ritual for 10 years to
protest Saudi control of the shrines.
   The pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. In that year, religious
extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca and held it for two
weeks before Saudi forces stormed it.
   More than 250 people were killed, including 100 of the Iranian
extremists. Saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more.
   The Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary guards posing
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.
   The next year, 402 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed in
riots in Mecca that the Saudis say were instigated by
fundamentalists.
   Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in April 1988. Tehran since has
been campaigning to strip King Fahd of his title as ``custodian of
the two holy shrines'' and place Mecca and Medina under
international supervision.

<HEAD>Affordable Housing Said Beyond the Reach of Many Minority Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affordable housing will remain unreachable for
nearly half the nation's black and Hispanic families during the next
decade unless significant changes are made in government policies,
according to a recent study.
   The study by the Private Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
said the situation could worsen in the 1990s.
   The study, released Monday, said affordable housing is beyond the
reach of nearly half the nation's black and Hispanic families and
blacks and Hispanics of all income levels are much more likely than
whites to live in substandard housing.
   Using recently released data from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and the Census Bureau, the research center, which
frequently advocates increased spending on social programs, found
that 42 percent of all black and Hispanic households spent more on
housing in 1985 than is considered affordable, compared with 27
percent of all whites.
   Under standards established by HUD, housing is considered
affordable if it consumes no more than 30 percent of a family's
income.
   The study said housing problems are especially severe among poor
minority households, with nearly four out of five paying for housing
costs outside the affordable range.
   Forty percent of poor Hispanic households and 37 percent of poor
black households were spending at least 70 percent of their income
on housing costs in 1985, leaving little money for food and other
necessities, the study said.
   And while black and Hispanic households make up 17 percent of all
households in the country, they make up 42 percent of those
occupying substandard housing and more than half of those living in
units with holes in the floor or evidence of rats.
   ``These stark findings indicate that the growing lack of
affordable housing has reached a crisis stage for blacks and
Hispanics, as well as for low-income Americans in general,'' said
Robert Greenstein, director of the center.
   Although the study was based on 1985 data, the report said
housing costs burdens are unlikely to have eased since then because
rental costs and the average income of poor families have risen at
about the same pace.
   In 1985, the study said, the typical poor minority household had
an income of less than $5,000 and spent 57 percent of its income on
housing.
   ``These high housing cost burdens are likely to have contributed
substantially to the growing problem of homelessness and to have
intensified other problems, such as the rising incidence of
hunger,'' said Edward B. Lazere, the study's principal author.
``When poor families must spend so much of their limited incomes for
housing, little money remains for other necessities.''
   Although the housing cost burdens of poor white households are as
severe as the burdens of poor Hispanic and black households,
Hispanics and blacks are much more likely to be poor than are whites
_ and therefore are more likely to face the high housing cost
burdens associated with poverty, the study said.
   It said problems faced by poor households of all races in finding
affordable housing have worsened since the 1970s. The increase in
the shortage of low-rent housing since 1978 can be traced primarily
to a sharp increase in the number of poor families, a substantial
reduction in the number of low-rent units in the housing stock, and
an increase in rental charges, it said.

<HEAD>FBI Says Jet Fighter Engines Returned To Hill Air Force Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI returned three stolen
F-16 jet fighter engines to the Air Force on Monday after processing
them for evidence, an agent said.
   However, FBI Agent Tim Screen would neither confirm nor deny
reports the disappearance of the $2 million engines was part of a
19-month ``sting'' operation aimed at a purported theft ring at the
base.
   Asked if suspects had been identified or if arrests were
imminent, Screen said, ``We're working on that now. We're
investigating certain people.'' He declined to say whether the
people were on base.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in Washington that Department of
Defense officials had told him a great number of other thefts had
been reported at Hill. He said many countries ``would love to get
hold of the engines'' to ``figure out our technology.''
   ``This looks like it will be a strong embarrassment for the state
of Utah,'' he said. ``It involves lots of dollars, that's all I can
say.''
   The Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200 engines were reported missing
last Wednesday by maintenance personnel returning from the
Independence Day holiday, base officials said. The engines are each
17 feet long, 34 inches in diameter, and weigh 3,200 pounds.
   The FBI turned the engines and a towing vehicle over to the Air
Force at 3:30 a.m. after checking them for evidence at a secret FBI
storage facility in Salt Lake City, about 30 miles to the south,
Screen said.
   Screen said further information was not available pending the
outcome of an investigation by the FBI, the Department of Defense
and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
   Hatch said the investigation was close to concluding, and that he
had been told the theft apparently was committed by Hill employees
or others familiar with base operations.
   ``They knew enough to cut locks on a gate, and replace them with
similar locks,'' the senator said, adding that the engines
apparently were taken from the base through a gate north of the
taxiway that is not patrolled often.
   Seventy-two F-16 fighters are assigned to the 388th Tactical
Fighter Wing, the base's main group, while 24 are used for the Air
Force Reserve 419th wing.

   The United States, which next week celebrates
the 20th anniversary of man's first moon landing, should establish a
permanent moon settlement, the National Space Society said Monday.
   The group, a public membership organization dedicated to
strengthening the U.S. civilian space effort, made its request in a
letter to President Bush.
   ``We believe this lunar settlement is the most appropriate goal
for the United States after the Freedom Space Station is
established,'' wrote TV figure Hugh Downs, chairman of the society's
board of governors
   ``The technologies, utilization of the moon's resources and
experience derived from the lunar effort are cucial as a stepping
stone to further human expansion into the solar system, including
future expeditions to Mars and beyond.''
   Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon July 20, 1969.
They were the first of 12 Americans to do so.

   Iran's main opposition group said Monday
it has sent the U.N. secretary-general a list of 2,023 political
prisoners allegedly executed in Iran since the cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The opposition also claimed that an Iranian legislator who
resigned last week has been detained by security police.
   Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Baghdad-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Holy Warriors, claimed those executed were tortured, and
that many political prisoners were being killed under the pretext of
a crackdown on drug traffickers.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq is based in Baghdad, Iraq. In a statement
sent by telex to The Associated Press in Nicosia, Rajavi said names
on the list sent to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
``formed only a fraction'' of politically inspired killings carried
out since a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire Aug. 20 halted eight years of
war between Iran and Iraq. His claims could not be confirmed
independently.
   The United Nations and international humanitarian agencies,
including London-based Amnesty International, earlier this year
accused Iran of executing several hundred political detainees.
   Rajavi said a new wave of executions and arrests followed the
June 3 death of Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``In the month that has elapsed since Khomeini's death, the
remnants of his regime ... have continued street executions on an
extensive scale to terrorize the people,'' the statement said.
   ``In many cities ... women have been hanged in public alongside
men and their bodies left hanging for several days to teach the
public a lesson,'' it said.
   In a separate statement, the Mujahedeen claimed legislator
Abdolmajid Sharpasand of the northern Iranian town of Kharadj, was
detained by the secret police along with several well-known town
clergymen. It gave no date for the arrest and it was not possible to
confirm the report independently.
   Iran's official media has said only that other legislators
demanded Sharpasand resign because of his ``indecent attitude.''
   The Mujahedeen statement claimed Sharpasand announced in
parliament on July 2 that he was resigning, citing ``grave anxiety
over the country's political future'' and the ``concentration of
power in a few hands.''

   President Corazon Aquino of the
Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to
expand economic ties with her nation.
   Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation
European tour, met with West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other
officials.
   Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily
indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after
World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her
homeland.
   ``We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at
the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national
honor,'' she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry
and Trade.
   ``We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of
runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own
experiences between the wars,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase
to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in
fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator
Ferdinand Marcos.
   She said that since her government took over in 1986, the
country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had
improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
   ``What we need to complete the equation are two elements
essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,''
Mrs. Aquino said.
   During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs.
Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West
Germany and the Philippines.
   Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade
with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free
market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock
out trade with other countries.
   Mrs. Aquino, who arrived in West Germany on Sunday, will meet
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday before departing for Paris.
She also is to visit Belgium.

   The State Department said Monday it expects the
Indian government to cooperate in clamping strict controls on the
export of chemicals that can be used to make poison gas and other
chemical weapons.
   ``It is our hope that all countries, including India, which are
capable of manufacturing the precursors needed to produce these
deadly weapons will institute very strict controls on their
exports,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
   He was commenting on a New York Times report that the tightening
of controls on the export of substances useful in chemical weapons
by the United States, Japan and European nations has made Indian
companies major sources for shipments of such material to Iran, Iraq
and Egypt.
   The spread of chemical weapons is a global problem of concern
``and I think it's a mutual concern that we share with other
countries such as India,'' Boucher said.
   The United States is discussing with India and other countries
how to curb this spread, he said, adding, ``We're confident that the
government of India will be taking all measures to control this
trade.''
   Boucher did not name the other countries and said he could not
rank the importance of various countries as suppliers.
   He said he was unable to describe the Indian response to U.S.
concerns, ``except to say that we, for our part, are very hopeful
that we can work with the Indian government to control the flow of
these chemicals.''
   An Indian Embassy statement issued late Monday in Washington said
that ``India is not involved in the production or trading of
chemical weapons as a matter of policy,'' and is committed to their
total elimination.
   It added that only recently had there come to India's attention
the problem of ``dual-use items which have legitimate commercial
applications in the pesticide industry, etc. There is no
well-established international regime to take care of such
chemicals.''
   It said the United States appreciated India's facilitating the
return of a shipment of 257 tons of Indian-made thionyl chloride, an
essential of mustard gas that is widely traded for the manufacture
of pesticides, after its movement from India to Iran via Dubai was
halted by the West German trading company that reportedly brokered
the deal.

<TEXT>
   U.S District Judge Robert Aguilar faced a
court for the first time as a criminal defendant Monday and pleaded
innocent to eight felony charges.
   Aguilar, 58, was indicted by a federal grand jury last month on
charges he used his office to do favors for convicted felons.
   Among other things, he is alleged to have sought favorable
treatment for two felons from other federal judges and tipped off an
ex-mobster about a court-ordered wiretap. In the process, the
indictment said, Aguilar turned his office into a ``racketeering
enterprise'' to obstruct justice.
   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Carter, has not commented,
but his lawyers contend the case is politically motivated because of
Aguilar's liberal record and his rulings against the government in
several important cases.
   If convicted, Aguilar faces up to 55 years in prison. The
indictment is the fourth this decade against a federal judge and the
first racketerring charge ever against a federal judge.
   Monday's arraignment before visiting U.S. District Judge Howard
Bratton of Albuquerque, N.M., lasted less than 20 minutes, and
Aguilar stood with his lawyers before the bench for less than three
minutes.
   Dressed in a gray business suit, he repeated ``the plea is not
guilty'' to the first two charges read by the court clerk, before
Bratton said further reading of the charges was unnecessary.
   Allowed to go free without bail, Aguilar left through a rear exit
without talking to reporters.
   Aguilar, who can be removed from office only by congressional
impeachment, has retained his judge's title and $89,500 salary, but
relinquished most of his duties while the case is pending.
   Justice Department prosecutor Ralph Martin did not object to the
no-bail release, but asked Bratton to prohibit Aguilar from
contacting any potential witnesses. Martin noted that one charge
accuses the judge of advising a witness to lie to the grand jury.
Bratton refused the request.
   Defense lawyer Patrick Hallinan told reporters the request would
have barred Aguilar from speaking to ``half of his family'' and
described it as part of the government's campaign to portray Aguilar
as a corrupt judge.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Children Swallowing Batteries From Ghostblaster Toys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poison control center physician said Monday
she knows of 19 children who have swallowed batteries from the new
``Ghostblaster'' toy offered by Hardee's Restaurants as a
promotional gimmick tied to the ``Ghostbuster II'' movie.
   At company headquarters in Rocky Mount, N.C., Hardee's said it
was altering the 2 million remaining toys to seal the battery
compartments and strengthen package warnings.
   Dr. Toby Litovitz, medical director of the Capital Poison Control
Center at Georgetown University Hospital, said 19 calls have been
received by the center's hotline over a 10-day period about children
between 1 and 3 years old swallowing the button batteries that
operate the toys.
   The center receives calls from all over the country, including
from other hospital-based poison control centers.
   Calls from anxious parents have come from everywhere and ``this
is just the tip of the iceberg,'' she said.
   She said she believed, based on past experience, that as many as
100 more incidents have gone unreported.
   Hardee's Restaurants began offering the promotional toys June 28,
allowing patrons who purchase a meal or a dessert to buy the small
rectangle noisemaker in one of four colors for $1.79. The toy comes
in red, black, white or gray and makes one of two different kinds of
noise to ``send away the ghost.''
   Hardee's distributed 2 million of the toys in a week and has 2
million more on hand, said John Merritt, vice president for public
affairs of Hardee's.
   Hardee's officials decided not enough attention was being paid to
posted warnings that the toys were not appropriate for children
under age 3, Merritt said.
   ``Little 6-year-old Johnny, which this toy is designed for,
leaves it lying around and his little brother gets it open and eats
the battery,'' he said.
   Hardee's informed the Consumer Product Safety Commission of the
problem and agreed to place similar warnings directly on the plastic
cases, sealing the battery compartments at the same time, he said.
   Merritt said the company knew of no injuries associated with
swallowing the batteries.
   ``Every year at Christmas, children ingest all kinds of small
parts and are none the worse for wear,'' he said. ``But it's not
good for you.''
   Merritt said anyone who already has a ``Ghostblaster'' can return
it to any restaurant to have it altered.
   Officials of the Consumer Product Safety Commission said they
were discussing an announcement about the toy with the company.
   Dr. Litovitz said the center averages about 400 button battery
ingestion cases a year but never so many from a single product.
   ``It's not an issue for hysteria because the batteries usually
pass through without a problem,'' said Dr. Litovitz.
   The small batteries also can be put into noses and ears, causing
hearing loss or facial deformity, she cautioned.
   She said parents should seek medical attention immediately for
any child swallowing a battery. If the battery becomes lodged in the
esophagus, there is a risk of perforation and death, she said.
   Chemicals leaking from the battery could cause severe burns to
the esophagus, she said.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radiation equipment at a
sterilization plant was shut down after three men were exposed to
radiation while trying to do repair work, the plant manager said
Monday.
   Orlando Lemus, manager of the plant on the eastern edge of San
Salvador, said two of the men suffered serious injuries in the
accident on Feb. 5. The two remained hospitalized in Mexico City on
Monday.
   The plant, owned by Delmed, S.A., makes plastic medical equipment
such as plasma bags and catheters. Cobalt and nuclear technology
provided by the Canadian firm Nordion is used to sterilize the
equipment.
   Lemus said the accident ``resulted purely from human error,'' and
that the Salvadoran Ministry of Labor had determined there was no
negligence on the part of the plant.
   But one of those injured said the accident was caused by
mechanical failure.
   ``The source of radiation got stuck. I'm the mechanic on duty. I
had to work on it,'' Francisco Roque Tobar said.
   He spoke from a Mexico City hospital where he and Jose Luis
Martinez were being treated. The hospital would not disclose their
conditions, but Tobar said one of his legs was amputated last week.
   Lemus said Tobar, 26, and two other employees entered a chamber
in which a rod of cobalt 60 had failed to return to a safe position
in a protective pool of water.
   Tobar failed to use a portable radiation monitor and he and the
other two men apparently ignored an alarm system warning them that
something was wrong, Lemus said.
   Tobar said he wasn't wearing a monitor, but that the alarm system
goes off so frequently that he ignored it.
   ``You have to go in to repair the equipment,'' Tobar said.
   Canadian Press quoted Nordion spokeswoman Donna Coates as saying
two company engineers arrived in El Salvador on Feb. 12 to help with
the malfunctioning equipment but were not told there had been a
serious accident.
   They got the rod to return to the protective pool and rendered
the equipment inoperable, the Canadian news agency said.

of another federal judge in San Francisco; SUBS graf 10: ``Hastings was,''

<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor, testifying Monday at the
start of hearings in the impeachment trial of Judge Alcee L.
Hastings, said he was shocked that the judge ordered the return of
$845,000 forfeited in a racketeering case.
   ``I was stunned at the order reversing the forfeiture,'' James
Deichert, chief of the Justice Department's organized crime strike
force in Atlanta, told a panel of 12 senators hearing evidence
against Hastings.
   Deichert said that nothing had changed in the months since
Hastings had ordered two brothers, Thomas and Frank Romano, to
forfeit the money as proceeds from racketeering operations.
``Everything was identical and out of the blue he was reversing
himself,'' he said.
   Deichert was the leadoff witness at the evidence hearings at
which members of the House acting as prosecutors promised to prove
that Hastings conspired to get a $150,000 payoff to keep the Romano
brothers out of prison and restore their money to them.
   The Romano brothers never took part in any such plot and both
have died since their December 1980 racketeering conviction
following a trial at which Hastings was the judge and Deichert was
the prosecutor.
   Hastings is accused of taking part in a plot with Washington
attorney William Borders in which a go-between carrying messages to
the Romanos was actually taking orders from the strike force and an
FBI undercover agent posed as one of the brothers.
   By coincidence, Hastings' trial in the Senate got under way on
the day that U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar entered pleas of
innocent in San Francisco to eight charges relating to accusations
that he used his office to do favors for convicted felons. It was
the fourth indictment of a federal judge in the decade of the 1980s
and the first to involve racketeering charges.
   ``Judge Hastings' actions ... present a pattern of misconduct
which cannot be tolerated in a United States district judge,'' Rep.
John Bryant, D-Texas, said as hearings got under way.
   Hastings also is accused of lying to the federal jury that
acquitted him of criminal charges in the matter in 1983 and
improperly disclosing information obtained from a federal wiretap.
   Hastings was impeached by the House a year ago. If convicted by
the Senate he would be removed from the U.S. District Court bench
and deprived of his $89,500 annual salary.
   Much of the opening remarks of both House Judiciary Committee
members who are serving as prosecutors and the judge's own attorney,
Terence Anderson of Miami, represented a review of material that has
become familiar in Congress over the last two years.
   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' Hastings told reporters in a
hallway outside the hearing room in the Hart Senate Office Building.
He also called the proceeding ``an abomination'' because they
consisted of ``the same old stuff, and I really resent it, quite
frankly.''
   The Senate is holding the evidentiary hearings before a special
committee rather than tie up the floor for weeks and thus prevent
action on legislation.
   The proceedings are being videotaped for the viewing of other
senators who evntually will vote on the floor on whether to convict
Hastings.
   The Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) carried the
proceedings to cable viewers nationwide.
   Bryant, lead counsel for the House, said that the Senate should
expel Hastings from the federal bench despite his 1983 acquittal. He
said the ``acquittal was the product of repeated lies and the
production of fabricated evidence at his criminal trial.''
   ``It is an acquittal that cannot be overturned,'' Bryant said.
``Judge Hastings cannot be prosecuted again. But he can be removed
from office.''
   Hastings' attorney portrayed his client as the innocent dupe of
Washington attorney William Borders, whom he described as ``a big
time rainmaker'' with career criminals for friends.
   ``Alcee L. Hastings was, is, and will forever be an innocent
man,'' declared Anderson as the dapper judge looked on impassively.
   Anderson also attacked another potential witness, William Dredge,
as ``a big-time fence'' and ``career informant'' who was desperate
to provide the FI with evidence against ``a big fish'' to keep out
of prison himself.
   Dredge is expected to testify on Tuesday behind closed doors in a
high-security hearing room designed for the Senate Intelligence
Committee.
   Reporters and cameras will be barred. ``He fears retaliation,''
Bryant told newsmen, because he has been a government witness in a
major labor racketeering trial involving top Cosa Nosa hoodlums.
   ``We don't want anyone to see his face,'' Bryant said.
   Borders, who wielded considerable political influence in the
1970s, was convicted of bribery-conspiracy after pulling out of a
suburban Virginia motel parking garage with a clothing bag stuffed
with $125,000 in cash and an FBI undercover agent posing as a
criminal by his side.
   Hastings, in Washington at the time for a testimonial dinner
honoring Borders, quickly hopped a plane for Florida after learning
of the arrest. FBI agents found him later that night in his
attorney's home in Miami.
   Bryant said the hasty exit was evidence of Hastings' guilt, but
Anderson scoffed at that, saying the judge ``spent two hours with
the FBI'' that night, ``and he responded to every one of their
questions.''
   ``He was not an avaricious man,'' Anderson declared. ``...This is
not a man who set out to make money.''

   Jim Bakker's former executive secretary
said Monday she had unlimited authority to sign the TV evangelist's
name on checks and other documents.
   ``He liked it (the signature) to look like his,'' said Shirley
Fulbright, testifying at the federal tax evasion trial of two former
PTL officials, brothers David and James Taggart. ``I tried my best.''
   Miss Fulbright also said David Taggart once boasted he had job
security at PTL because of things he knew about Bakker, who built
the evangelical empire before stepping down in 1987 in a sex and
money scandal.
   ``I vaguely remember a comment he made in jest, jokingly, in
which he said something to the effect that Mr. Bakker would not fire
him or me because of some of the things we knew about him,'' Miss
Fulbright said.
   ``He laughingly said he knew a lot about Jim Bakker. That's
all,'' she said when pressed by special prosecutor David Brown for
specifics.
   The Taggarts are charged with failing to pay $487,000 in taxes
from 1984 to 1987 on $1.1 million that prosecutors say the Taggarts
diverted from the ministry for their personal use by taking cash
advances on PTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks.
   Bakker is charged in Charlotte, N.C., with fraud and conspiracy
concerning PTL operations. A federal magistrate ruled Monday that
Bakker can be tried in that city without fear of pretrial publicity
because two years have elapsed since his resignation drew media
coverage of the ``holy war'' in television ministries.
   Miss Fulbright testified that she signed Bakker's name to several
documents authorizing payment to the Taggarts without Bakker's
knowledge. One memorandum authorized PTL to pay James Taggart's
interior design firm a $10,000-a-month retainer. Another authorized
a $100,000 payment to the firm.
   She said she also signed an authorization to pay David Taggart a
$120,000 bonus shortly before Bakker's resignation.
   Miss Fulbright testified she signed Bakker's name at the
direction of David Taggart.
   ``Did this ever cause you concern, Miss Fulbright,'' Brown asked
her.
   ``At that moment, I did not know what it represented,'' she said.
``Later on, I realized what they did represent.''
   Under cross-examination, Miss Fulbright testified that Bakker
previously had given her the authority to sign his name on
documents, including checks, letters and memos. Miss Fulbright said
she knew of no limitations on her authority to use Bakker's
signature and said her work was personally examined by Bakker.
   ``I assumed I could sign everything ... if it were necessary,''
she said.
   Witnesses have testified that the Taggarts shared expenses on an
apartment in exclusive Trump Towers in New York City, gave each
other Jaguars for Christmas presents and bought expensive jewelry at
Cartier and Gucci.
   If convicted, the Taggarts could each receive 30 years in prison
and fines totaling $1.35 million.

one-day strikes for higher pay that have disrupted public transport.
   But Jimmy Knapp, head of the National Union of Railwaymen, said
there were no plans to cancel Wednesday's 24-hour strike, which
would be the fourth in as many weeks.
   The one-day walkouts have disrupted services on the capital's red
double-deckers, which carry 3.2 million people daily, as well as the
trains and subways, which carry nearly 5 million.
   The labor talks were to begin Tuesday morning. Previous talks
broke down in early May over British Rail's proposed changes in
collective bargaining.
   Monday began what could be the worst week of industrial unrest in
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 years in power, as British
Rail train drivers began an overtime ban.
   Also, the Transport and General Workers Union said 9,400
dockworkers would strike at midnight Monday over the abolition of a
proposal that would guarantee them job security. More than 500,000
town hall employees throughout Britain planned a 48-hour strike for
Tuesday and Wednesday. again stop on Wednesday.
   British Rail said 120 of its 500 morning rush-hour trains were
canceled Monday in its busy southern region outside London because
of the overtime ban by the 17,500 members of the Associated Society
of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.
   The railworkers, who want a 10 percent pay increase, have
rejected a 7 percent offer. The union also demands an end to a
management attempt to negotiate separately with different categories
of workers. Union officials say the move would weaken the bargaining
unit as whole.
   The subway workers, who have staged 10 walkouts, want a
$101-a-week raise for operating trains without a guard. Management
has offered $47 plus 14 days of extra vacation; the package would be
tied to increased productivity.

   The city's district attorney asked a federal
judge on Monday to reinstate laws that make abortions illegal,
saying the case could challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's stand on
abortion.
   District Attorney Harry Connick, acting in the wake of last
week's U.S. Supreme Court decision, requested the return of state
laws that make abortions criminal.
   U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman scheduled a hearing for Aug. 9.
   ``The Supreme Court seems to be issuing an invitation to people
to resolve this highly emotional issue,'' Connick told a news
conference. ``I would think everyone interested in the issue,
regardless of the standpoint, would be very anxious to see it
settled.''
   The Louisiana Legislature approved a resolution last week 81-13
asking district attorneys to enforce the criminal statutes in light
of the Supreme Court decision on Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, a Missouri case.
   That decision stopped short of overturning the 1973 Roe Vs. Wade
decision under which women have the right to seek abortions, but
allowed states to impose new restrictions on abortions.
   Connick said the Legislature's intent was to enforce the laws
which have remained on the books but were not enforced because they
were found unconstitutional under Roe.
   ``The court should make a new judgment, not just based on Roe,
but also in light of Webster, because the laws have changed
radically,'' said John Baker Jr., Connick's lawyer and a law
professor at Louisiana State University.
   Both men said the Supreme Court's recent decision represents a
change in law and requires a different outcome from that received in
1976, when the abortion laws were ruled unenforceable.
   Michelle Gross, president of a local chapter of the National
Organization for Women, said her group met with Connick for about an
hour before he made his announcement.
   ``It was expected, but we are very angry about it. In our meeting
today with Mr. Connick, he said he didn't know anything about the
case or whether the statute of limitations would apply in the
case,'' Gross said.
   ``We are going back to the district attorney's office tomorrow
and we are going to be there every day until he decides to get off
this ... very dangerous path he is treading. We feel strongly that
he is trying to seek fame and power off the backs of women,'' she
said.
   Louisiana state law declares that ``the unborn child is a human
being from the moment of conception, and is, therefore, a legal
person for purposes of the unborn child's right to life.''
   The statutes outlaw abortions, the distribution of drugs that
cause abortion and the display of abortion advertising.
   Under the laws, a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable
for punishment, only the person who performs the procedure.
   Women who undergo abortions to save their lives and those who
perform them would not be affected if the laws became enforceable,
said a statement by Connick's office.
   Connick's motion for reconsideration said 15 states still have
abortion laws on the books.
   ``It is apparent that a majority of the Supreme Court is prepared
to uphold state abortion statutes if those statutes are reasonably
related to protecting human life, and indeed to protecting potential
human life,'' the motion said.
   ``In light of this new development in the law, it is our view
that a majority of the Supreme Court would have little trouble
upholding Louisiana's criminal abortion statutes,'' it said.
   Connick argued that this attack through the courts was preferable
to testing the law by arresting a doctor.

   Utility and gasoline prices soared
and the national currency's value was halved today as the new
government began imposing measures it hopes will end the worst
recession in Argentina's 173-year history.
   ``Argentina is bankrupt,'' Economy Minister Miguel Roig said
Sunday night in a nationwide address. Policies to nurture the
country to health ``will be exceptional and, lamentably, very
harsh.''
   The plan also envisions cutting back drastically on government
spending, selling off many state-run industries, scaling back
subsidies and tax breaks for private companies and enforcing widely
ignored tax laws.
   ``We have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia ... If not,
Argentina has no future,'' said President Carlos Menem, who on
Saturday took over this country where runaway inflation has provoked
food riots this year.

   Fires raged out of control in eight states and more than 600
people fled a Nebraska park where a lightning-sparked blaze today
burned to within a half-mile of the historic fort where Sioux Chief
Crazy Horse was killed.
   A blaze also threatened the ancient Indian cliff dwellings of
Mesa Verde in Colorado, and an arson fire swept toward the Ventana
wilderness in the mountains rising from Big Sur, 120 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Major fires also were burning in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Oregon and Wyoming.
   Cooler temperatures and rain helped nearly extinguish wilderness

   Chagrined by recent gains of Israeli
hardliners, three top State Department officials are traveling to
Israel next week to determine the prospects of a U.S.-backed
election plan for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   The delegation will be led by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger and will include John Kelly, assistant secretary of
state for Middle Eastern affairs, and Dennis Ross, the department's
top policy planner, a diplomatic source said. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The mission is designed ``to see where the Israeli government
stands'' after the right-wing Likud bloc forced Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to place strict limits on the election plan, said the
source.
   Kelly, who was recently confirmed for his post, was expected to
travel to the Middle East early next month but his trip was pushed
up in view of the developments in Israel, said the source. Ross is
traveling to Europe to meet Secretary of State James Baker who joins
President Bush for his trip to Eastern Europe and the Paris economic
summit.

   Finance Minister Shimon Peres urged today that
his left-leaning Labor Party quit the governing coalition because of
the right-wing Likud bloc's new hard line on peace negotiations with
the Palestinians.
   Such a move could bring down the government and, seven months
after the last elections, force a new vote.
   Peres, the Labor chairman, told his party's 120-member leadership
bureau that he wants to convene the its governing Central Committee
``as soon as possible'' and to ask it to endorse the move.
   Last week, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc met and
toughened its conditions for elections in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip for Palestinian leaders who would negotiate greater
autonomy from Israel.

   A suspended black priest who defied church
authorities for the second week by conducting his own brand of
services incorporating African religious rites says he will try to
reconcile with the Roman Catholic Church.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., who accuses the church of
racism and failing its black parishioners, told a local television
station Sunday that he planned to begin seeking reconciliation by
the end of the week ``so that we are not separated and divided, but
we are all working toward the same goal.''
   Stallings declined to discuss terms of a proposed reconciliation,
but told WRC-TV, ``I think that this could happen within the next 30
days.''
   The Rev. William Lori, personal secretary to Washington
Archbishop Cardinal James A. Hickey, said the church would welcome
reconciliation.

   The ruling Communist Party, seeking to improve an
image tarnished by its harsh suppression of dissent, today said it
has expelled hundreds of its members for corruption.
   The People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the 47.7
million-member party, said 452 officials in the southern province of
Guizhou were expelled for corruption during the first half of 1989.
   On Sunday, it was reported that one local party leader in Guizhou
was given the death sentence for selling counterfeit liquor.
   The official press recently has highlighted crackdowns on
corruption as part of the drive to improve its image following its
violent June 4 crackdown on the student-led movement for democratic

   One of the last poems written by Gertrude
Stein, the American writer who spent most of her life in France, is
being published for the first time by the American correspondent she
gave it to 45 years ago.
   He is Frank Gervasi, now 81 years old, who has put it in a book
called ``The Violent Decade,'' being published today.
   He said the poem was her way of thanking him for getting her own
book, ``Wars I Have Seen,'' through wartime censorship to her New
York publisher. Stein died in 1946 at the age of 72.
   The poem, called ``A Ballad,'' was written on nine pages of air
mail paper from Air France, the French national airline.

   The doomsayers had said that allowing
hard-working Icelanders to drink strong beer would turn them into
lazy, round-the-clock drunks.
   But since ``B-Day'' on March 1, when strong beer flowed legally
for the first time in 74 years, the police have reported no increase
in drunken driving and bar owners say people still restrict their
hard drinking to weekends.
   ``Icelanders are happier and less drunk,'' said Gudrun
Helgadottir, president of the Althing (parliament) and a sponsor of
the legislation legalizing beer with alcoholic content above 2.25
percent.
   Anti-alcohol campaigners, however, report backsliding by some
recovered alcoholics and worry about more imbibing in general,
especially among the young.
   ``B-Day'' was celebrated with parties, pub openings and even a
few free drinks, and although stong beer is expensive, it is now the
favorite alcoholic beverage in this North Atlantic island nation of
250,000.
   In the first month, Icelanders consumed nearly 1.3 million quarts
of beer _ about 5.1 quarts for every man, woman and child.
   Hoskuldur Jonsson, general manager of the State Wine, Spirit and
Tobacco Authority, said once the novelty wore off, beer consumption
dropped to between 635,000 and 690,000 quarts a month.
   ``The wave went over and we are now sailing on a rather calm
sea,'' Jonsson said.
   Olafur Arnason, director of the state-funded Liquor Prevention
Council of Iceland, says total alcohol sales rose 25 percent in the
first three months of 1989 and that state institutions for
alcoholics are reporting more admissions of ex-alcoholics who had
been sober for several years.
   To combat an increase in drinking by 18- to 20-year-olds, the
council has put out an advertisement showing a cartoon of a young
person with no head.
   ``God gave you intelligence; don't drink it away,'' it says.
   Until March 1, Icelanders could drink whiskey, vodka, wine,
low-alcohol beer or Brennivin, the national strong spirit also
called ``Black Death.'' But they could not legally buy strong beer
except at airport duty-free stores.
   Iceland ended 25 years of total prohibition in 1933, but a legal
quirk kept all but the weakest beers banned. A powerful temperance
lobby kept it that way until May 1988, when the Althing lifted the
prohibition.
   ``The argument of opponents was that beer would increase the
consumption of Icelanders and they'd be drunk all day,'' Mrs.
Helgadottir said.
   ``What we've seen is that the sale of strong spirits has fallen
... and the police are very happy. There is less fighting on the
streets on Friday and Saturday, less violence as a whole.''
   Jonsson said consumption of white wine fell by 30 percent in
March, and strong spirits, especially white spirits like vodka, by
10 percent.
   ``I worried if we would have the same attitude to beer _ drinking
during working hours _ as they do in Germany and Denmark,'' he said.
   That hasn't happened, he added, and ``some police tell me it's
easier to deal with people who drink beer than strong spirits
because they are less violent or more sleepy, or not as quick in
their reactions.''
   Another positive effect, he said, has been the collapse of the
thriving black market in smuggled beer, which is equally expensive.
   A glass in a bar costs $3.40 to $4.20. A six-pack in the state
liquor stores costs $10.50 to $11.90. The top seller is West
Germany's Lowenbrau, brewed here under license.
   Oskar Sveinsson, a waiter at Iceland's oldest pub, Gaukur a
Stong, said up to 60 percent of sales were now beer. But he added:
``People have found that if they drink a lot of beer, they get a lot
of headaches ... so if they are going to get drunk, they drink
something else, mainly vodka.''
   Chuck Fleenor of Bluefield, W.Va., who worked behind the bar at
the Duus-Hus pub on ``B-Day,'' said: ``I think people have become
more mellow now. Before, they were drinking harder whiskey and
things would get a little rowdy on weekends.''

   The new government of President
Alfredo Christiani is proposing stiff prison terms for those taking
part in activities of union, peasant and human rights organizations
considered guerrilla fronts.
   The Christian Democratic Party, which handed over power in June
to the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, termed
the bill ``fascist.''
   The entire political opposition has condemned the draft
legislation, which seems certain to be passed by Arena's legislative
majority.
   Opponents say the bill, which overhauls the penal code,
drastically erodes constitutional rights, including freedom of the
press.
   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists sent a telex
message to Cristiani expressing alarm that the legislation will
``severely hamper (journalists') ability to exercise their
internationally recognized right to pursue their profession.''
   The government says the legislation is necessary to combat
terrorism.
   It was presented to the unicameral legislature late in June amid
a spate of assassinations and bombings authorities blamed on
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The insurgents have denied responsibility for attacks on
non-military officials and say some members of the far right are
employing terrorist tactics to eliminate rivals.
   They also accuse the government and military of wanton violence
in an effort to gain support for harsh legislative measures.
   A 9-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led rebels and the
Salvadoran government has left an estimated 70,000 dead, most of
them civilians.
   The legislation provides for prison terms of up to 30 years for
those convicted of murder, kidnapping, armed assault or sabotage
intended ``to provoke a state of terror.''
   It also provides up to 20 years in prison for those who take part
in peaceful takeovers or sit-ins at public buildings, schools,
embassies or churches. Those who block traffic with demonstrations
or marches, as well as those who paint slogans on public or private
buildings, could be sentenced to five years.
   Dozens of left-leaning ``popular organizations'' of workers,
peasants, displaced people and rights activists routinely employ
marches, sit-ins and graffiti to express their views.
   The legislation provides for up to 10 years in prison for anyone
``who voluntarily collaborates toward the realization of the goals
of any terrorist group, band or organization.''
   Authorities consider most ``popular organizations'' fronts for
FMLN activity. The state pays for advertisements in newspapers
explicitly linking union, rights and peasant groups to the insurgent
army.
   The popular organizations deny the charges.
   ``This is the old `sea-and-fish' thesis,'' said the Rev. Segundo
Montes, a Jesuit priest and director of the Human Rights Institute
of the prestigious Central American University. He referred to the
tenet that guerrilla forces _ the fish _ move undetected through a
sympathetic populace _ the sea.
   ``But the sea is now more than the rural population,'' he said.
``It includes unions and humanitarian organizations. The right sees
demands for higher wages not as demands for higher wages, but as
support for Marxist revolution.
   ``The object of this law is to make repression legal, to destroy
everything leftist,'' he said in an interview.
   The local and international press corps are concerned about the
bill's provision of a maximum four-year prison term for anyone ``who
in any manner spreads or promulgates propaganda that subverts the
public order.''
   The draft does not define what constitutes subversion of the
public order.
   Communications Minister Mauricio Sandoval met with local and
foreign reporters in an attempt to assure them that the law was not
designed to restrict the press, but the journalists left the meeting
unsatisfied.
   ``The law's sweeping language could be interpreted to include
almost any type of legitimate reporting,'' said the Committee to
Protect Journalists' telex message to Cristiani.
   The Christian Democrats, in a communique labeling the proposed
law ``fascist,'' said it was ``an attack on the most elemental human
rights'' and an attempt ``to impose state terrorism that would favor
the FMLN and prejudice the people.''

   Along the muddy Maroni River
deep in the Amazon rain forest, thousands of refugees wait for an
obscure civil war to end in neighboring Suriname.
   They are Bush Negroes, descendants of West African slaves who
fled into the jungle after Dutch colonists brought them across the
Atlantic hundreds of years ago to work the plantations.
   From the late 1600s to the early 1800s, thousands of slaves
fought off the settlers, destroying plantations, freeing other
slaves and vanishing into the vast tropical hinterland.
   Isolated like many Indian tribes of the Amazon region, the Bush
Negroes have their own language and culture.
   ``For three centuries, the Bush Afro-Americans have been a nation
within a nation,'' Arthur Hailey, author of ``Roots,'' wrote in the
introduction to a history of the Bush Negroes. ``They have remained
independent and faithful to African traditions like no other group
in the New World.''
   Today, they flee a three-year war between Suriname's National
Army and the Jungle Commando, a rebel group of about 200 whose
leader, Ronny Brunswijk, is a Bush Negro from the Mongo Tapu village
in eastern Suriname.
   Most Bush Negroes come from thatched hut villages in eastern
Suriname, where they exist by fishing, hunting, planting crops and
gathering wild nuts and fruits.
   They number about 65,000 in six tribal nations _ the Aukaner,
Ndjuka, Saramaka, Paramaka, Matuari and Kwinti.
   Since the fighting erupted in 1986 in Suriname, hundreds of Bush
Negroes have been killed and many villages destroyed. The military
accuses Bush Negroes of being rebels or of aiding them.
   More than 7,000 Bush Negroes and hundreds of Amerindians have
crossed the Maroni River to camps near St. Laurent in this French
territory.
   About 10,000 others have fled to Suriname's capital, Paramaribo.
   They tell similar stories of the army burning their villages and
killing their children, husbands and wives.
   ``The military burned my village, my hut, with everything in it.
Every day it's bang-bang-bang,'' said Swanita, the mother of seven
children.
   Most Bush Negroes aren't involved in the war and say they just
want to live in peace.
   Although Ronny Brunswijk is one of them, many Bush Negroes,
including his brother John, are baffled by him.
   ``I don't know what he wants; he never told me,'' said John, 25,
who is chief of the Ndjukas and came to the Acarouany camp with his
wife and two children 2{ years ago. ``But I'm not like him. I don't
like fighting.''
   Ronny, 27, is a Cuban-trained soldier who was the personal
bodyguard of Cmdr. Desi Bouterse of Suriname's armed forces until
being fired in 1986.
   Details of their falling out are unknown, but the war is seen as
a personal feud between Brunswijk and the 42-year-old Bouterse.
   After he was fired, Brunswijk is said to have taken arms and
ammunition with him. He robbed banks and gave the money to his
people, gaining the reputation of a Robin Hood. But in June, 1986,
Bouterse's army attacked Brunswijk's village, and the Jungle
Commando was born.
   The refugees are shunned in French Guiana, a land of 80,000
people on the northern shoulder of South America. In St. Laurent,
with a population of 7,000, many blame them for a rise in drug
trafficking, robbery and murder.
   The refugees live outside St. Laurent in four camps, each run by
about 20 French military police. To leave even for a few hours, they
need permission and are transported on military trucks.
   ``The refugees live in good conditions and have plenty of food
and medical care,'' said Guido Coosemans, head of the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees office in St. Laurent. ``But the
problem is that the camps are more or less closed camps, and there
is no possibility of employment.''
   Many view the Bush Negroes, also known as Maroons, as primitive
because of their isolated existence.
   ``Maroons are the people who have the most problems right now. If
they come to Paramaribo, they get the lowest paid jobs and live in
the worst conditions,'' said Gloria Leurs, of the human-rights
organization Mooiwana '86, named after a Surinamese village where at
least 35 refugees were killed in an army raid Nov. 29, 1986.
   The French government is waiting to see if a peace agreement,
signed in early June between the government and Brunswijk, takes
hold before repatriating the refugees to Suriname.
   The refugees are wary.
   ``We don't believe the army wants peace,'' said 27-year-old
Nathaniel, the ``granman,'' or chief, of the Acarouany refugee camp,
which has 1,428 refugees. ``If we go back, they will kill us.''

   Today is Sunday, July 16, the 197th day of 1989. There are 168
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty years ago, on July 16, 1969, Apollo 11, carrying
astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael
Collins, blasted off from Cape Kennedy on the first mission to the
surface of the moon.
   On this date:
   In 1790, the District of Columbia was established as the seat of
the United States government.
   In 1862, David G. Farragut became the first rear admiral in the
U.S. Navy.
   In 1918, Russia's Czar Nicholas II, his empress and their five
children were executed by the Bolsheviks.
   In 1935, the first parking meters were installed, in Oklahoma
City.
   In 1945, the United States exploded its first experimental atomic
bomb, in the desert of Alamogordo, N.M.
   In 1951, J.D. Salinger's novel ``The Catcher in the Rye'' was
published.
   In 1957, Marine Maj. John Glenn set a transcontinental speed
record, flying a jet from California to New York in three hours, 23
minutes and eight seconds.
   In 1964, Sen. Barry M. Goldwater accepted the Republican
presidential nomination in San Francisco, saying ``extremism in the
defense of liberty is no vice.''
   In 1973, during the Senate Watergate hearings, former White House
aide Alexander P. Butterfield revealed the existence of President
Nixon's secret taping system.
   In 1980, the Republican national convention in Detroit nominated
Ronald Reagan for president. Reagan appeared before the delegates
that night to announce that George Bush would be his running mate.
   In 1983, 20 people were killed when a British Airways Sikorsky
S-61 helicopter, shuttling passengers to the Scilly Isles vacation
resort, crashed and sank in the English Channel.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter proposed spending $140
billion over the next decade to free the U.S. from dependence on
foreign oil.
   Five years ago: New York Gov. Mario Cuomo delivered the keynote
address at the Democratic convention in San Francisco, accusing
President Reagan of a ``kind of social Darwinism'' in which only the
fittest survive.

<HEAD>Campaign Reform Easier Said Than Done</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dilemma for campaign finance reformers is
that the only people who can write new rules are the players _ and
they want to win.
   Republicans surely would be more tolerant of what they call the
congressional ``incumbency protection system'' but for the fact that
Democrats hold the wide House majority. The re-election rate, which
exceeded 98 percent last time, helps perpetuate Democratic control
of the House.
   Proposals that seem fair and evenhanded almost invariably turn
out to have side effects that work to the advantage of one party or
the other.
   President Bush said he would be outraged at the suggestion that
his campaign finance proposals to Congress were intended to help
Republicans. But Democratic leaders said that is exactly what the
administration proposals would do.
   With Democrats controlling both the House and the Senate, the
Bush package stands no realistic chance of enactment. But it does
provide a starting point for debate and perhaps compromise
legislation on a subject that was not on the agenda at Ronald
Reagan's White House.
   There are a variety of reform proposals before Congress now. A
bipartisan House group is trying to draft a plan both parties can
accept.
   A half-dozen Senate Democrats have proposed a constitutional
amendment to let Congress impose ceilings on campaign expenditures,
a step the Supreme Court has held would infringe on free speech.
   Campaign scholar Larry J. Sabato of the University of Virginia
calls that an example of ``a bad reform idea that sounds good,''
attractive on the surface but likely to tilt the system even more
heavily in favor of congressional incumbents.
   Sabato notes that Congress, ``composed of 535 incumbents who are
fervently convinced of the worthiness of their own re-elections,''
would write any spending ceilings. He said that probably would work
to the disadvantage of challengers who need ``major expenditures''
to catch up with such incumbent advantages as name recognition,
staff, free mailings, district offices and constituent services.
   In a Twentieth Century Fund study of campaign finance, Sabato
suggests free broadcast time as a way to lower campaign costs. He
proposes eight hours per station per year, the time to be controlled
by the major parties. But similar ideas have been discussed off and
on for 50 years.
   Sabato concedes the odds against his proposal, saying such plans
always have been ``consigned to the junkyard of good ideas that were
legislatively impractical.''
   Nor are Democratic calls for public financing of congressional
campaigns likely to get anywhere in the face of strong Republican
opposition.
   Bush said public financing would erode participation in the
political process. ``I will not support kicking the citizen out of
the political process by saying that a citizen cannot financially
support the candidate of his or her choice,'' he said.
   Presidential campaigns have been publicly financed since 1976.
Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis each got $46.1 million
in federal money to run their 1988 campaigns.
   To ``free our electoral system from the grip of special
interests,'' the Bush campaign finance plan would eliminate
political action committees sponsored by corporations, unions and
trade associations, which means most of them. PAC contributions for
the 1988 congressional elections went to Democrats $98.6 million to
$60.7 million, demonstrating their tilt toward incumbents.
   Bush also would limit contributions by independent political
action committees to $2,500 a candidate instead of $5,000. His
package also includes a 2{-fold increase in the amounts the national
parties can give their House and Senate candidates. Republicans have
been stronger in national party fund raising; the Democratic
National Committee has launched a drive to strengthen its
fundraising operations.
   The president wants to sharply restrict use of the postage-free
congressional mail privileges, an incumbents' advantage Congress
recently expanded.
   He seeks a federal law to set guidelines for congressional
redistricting, due after the 1990 census, so that legislatures can't
draw the lines to benefit one political party over the other.
Democrats have full legislative control in 28 states, Republicans in
8.
   That's why fairness is hard to define, let alone legislate.

   The only ``hit'' of the fall television season
predicted by the nation's largest advertising agency is ``Booker''
on the Fox Broadcasting Co.
   The fact that a Fox show was selected, but not one show from the
three networks was listed as a hit, says something about the
changing face of television.
   The 1989-90 networks schedule is cautious, conservative and
comfortable, according to the report. More shows than ever have been
renewed, there are fewer programs that might be considered
troublesome and a heavy reliance on stars and programs that have
worked well in the past.
   The annual preview of the fall season by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising, however, gives ABC's ``Chicken Soup,'' starring Jackie
Mason, a nine on a scale of 1-10.
   Other highly-rated network shows are: NBC's ``Nutt House,'' CBS'
``The Famous Teddy Z'' and ABC's ``Family Matters,'' all eights.
   The Saatchi report cites ``dramatic shifts in the business of
television itself: competition from independents, cable and VCRs''
and wonders if the ``economics of television can continue to support
big events _ from miniseries to the Olympics.''
   Calling competition the major source of network pressures, it
said that during the writers' strike last year viewers did not turn
away from television. ``Instead they turned their dials to Fox
broadcasting and ad-supported cable,'' the report said.
   Fox improved its average ratings by almost 50 percent with ``some
of the most talked about shows on television'' and is expanding its
programming to Monday nights in September.
   ``Booker,'' a spinoff from Fox's ``21 Jump Street,'' stars
Richard Grieco as private investigator Dennis Booker. The character
was noted for his renegade street tactics and unconventional style
on ``21 Jump Street,'' which has a large and loyal following of
young people. ``Booker'' will open the Sunday night schedule and
``21 Jump Street'' will open Fox's new Monday night programming.
   ``Chicken Soup'' stars comedian Jackie Mason as a man forced to
retire at 52 from his job as a pajama salesman who finds
satisfaction helping inner-city kids at a local community center. It
takes on an ``Abie's Irish Rose'' aspect with the Jewish character's
love affair with a gentile woman played by Lynn Redgrave.
   The comedy follows ``Roseanne'' on Tuesday night, which is a big
ratings night for ABC. ``Roseanne'' has consistently beaten NBC's
``The Cosby Show'' for first place in the Nielsen ratings in recent
months.
   ``Chicken Soup'' could find itself in the same situation that ``A
Different World'' has enjoyed on NBC. Following ``The Cosby Show''
has placed ``A Different World'' near the top of the ratings,
although the quality of the show doesn't merit it. ``Chicken Soup''
lacks both humor and charm, and the relationship between Mason and
Redgrave fails to light a spark.
   CBS' ``The Famous Teddy Z'' stars Jon Cryer as a mailroom clerk
in a talent agency who suddenly becomes a hot agent. The show was
created by Hugh Wilson, who also created ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and
``Frank's Place.''
   NBC's ``Nutt House'' reunites stars Harvey Korman and Cloris
Leachman and comic creator Mel Brooks (``High Anxiety'') in a zany
comedy about a New York hotel that's fallen on hard times. It
follows ``Night Court'' on Wednesday night.
   ABC's ``Family Matters'' following ``Full House'' on Fridays is a
spinoff of ``Perfect Strangers.'' Hariette Winslow, the elevator
operator, gets her own show and family. Reginald Veljohnson, perhaps
best known as the cop in ``Die Hard,'' plays her police officer
husband.
   Other possible successes listed in the report are three NBC
shows, ``Hardball,'' ``Mancuso, FBI,'' and ``Sister Kate.''
   John Ashton plays a 45-year-old detective who pushes hard to stay
ahead of his young partner in ``Hardball'' on Friday. Robert Loggia
is crusty, cynical FBI agent Nick Mancuso in ``Mancuso, FBI,'' a
spinoff from the miniseries ``Favorite Son.'' Stephanie Beacham,
late of ABC's ``Dynasty,'' plays a hard-nosed nun at a Catholic home
for children in ``Sister Kate.''
   The two shows given the least chance for success are CBS' ``A
Peaceable Kingdom,'' a family drama starring Lindsay Wagner as the
head of a zoo, and Fox's ``Hidden Video,'' a contemporary version of
``Candid Camera.'' The Saatchi report said ``A Peaceable Kingdom''
faces tough competition from ABC's ``Growing Pains'' and ``Head of
the Class'' on Wednesdays.

      Elsewhere in television:
   LETTERS FOR THE BEAST _ Viewers for Quality Television is urging
its members to write to CBS in support of ``Beauty and the Beast.''
The show is not on the fall schedule, although CBS has said it would
return in the future. ``It is difficult to believe CBS, in light of
last year's `Frank's Place' deceit,'' said VQT director Dorothy
Swanson. ``Viewers were lulled then _ they will not be again.'' She
suggested CBS may be waiting for the fuss to die down before quietly
canceling the show, as it did with ``Frank's Place.''

   In a movie world where studio bosses seem to
change chairs as frequently as they do shirts, one close-knit group
of filmmakers has been prospering for 27 years. They are the folks
who bring the biennial adventures of James Bond.
   ``Licence to Kill,'' a midsummer entry in the season of
blockbusters, boasts a veteran crew.
   Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli has produced or co-produced all 16 of
the Bond films. Richard Maibaum has co-written 13. Desmond
Llewelleyn has played the gadget maker Q in 14. Peter Lamont has
been production designer for 14. John Barry has scored 11 Bond
films, though a conflict of assignments kept him from the new one
(Michael Kamen takes his place). John Glen has directed the last
five.
   In addition, stunt coordinators, special effects designers,
publicists, stunt men and others have long served the Bond pictures.
   Michael Wilson dates back to the 1964 ``Goldfinger,'' on which he
was an assistant director for the Fort Knox sequence. He has been
with Broccoli for 17 years, first as assistant, then executive
producer.
   In the recent films he has been co-producer and co-writer. The
New Yorker formerly practiced international taxation law, a good
background for worldwide filming.
   Interviewed in his office at MGM-UA, he was asked about the
peculiar _ to Americans _ spelling of ``Licence to Kill.''
   ``There was some discussion over whether we should spell it as
American usually do _ though the dictionary lists both `license,'
which comes first, and `licence,''' he said. ``In England, the noun
is always spelled `licence' and the verb is `license.' We decided
since we had a British subject and a British agent and Ian Fleming
had written it that way as a title, we would adopt that spelling.''
   Only the title is Fleming's; the plot was devised by the
filmmakers because all of Fleming's plots have been used up.
   Starting with ``Dr. No'' in 1962, the first five Bond films were
released annually. Now they come every other year, and that allows
for a more sensible pace.
   From the start, the Bond movies were unbeatable at the box office
with their winning combination of violence, mystery, exotic locales,
sex, sophistication, high-tech toys and almost campy humor.
   The Bond movies also made credit and pre-credit sequences
memorable bits to watch. In ``From Russia With Love,'' for example,
a man presumably with Bond's face is chased and killed. The titles
then emerge on the undulating body of a belly dancer.
   ``Licence to Kill'' began two years ago with a trip to China in
search of locales. Wilson and Maibaum tried a couple of stories
based in China but they didn't work out.
   The two writers decided to follow the headlines and spin a yarn
about a notorious drug dealer who controls a Latin American country.
The scripting period took about eight months.
   ``Normally, we begin our preproduction in February,'' said
Wilson. ``We started filming in Mexico in mid-July, and we finished
around Thanksgiving time. We go into post-production until around
Easter. Then we have the film ready for July release.''
   Unlike previous Bond movies that have spanned continents,
``Licence to Kill'' was shot in Mexico and Key West, Fla. The
company filmed interiors at Mexico City's Churubusco studio, street
scenes of ``Isthmus City'' in and around the capital and seaside
locations at Acapulco. A second unit worked at Mexicali in Baja for
14 weeks to stage a spectacular chase of tanker trucks, the climax
of the film.
   Despite the heavy logistics, Wilson reported that the cost of
``Licence to Kill'' was $30 million to $35 million. This, he said,
was about average for a big production these days.
   Timothy Dalton seems more comfortable in the new film than he did
in his first Bond outing, ``The Living Daylights.'' Wilson agreed.
   ``What happened was that when we first cast Dalton in `Living
Daylights,' we had already written the script. He came in very late,
and we had already written sort of a generic Bond. Dalton played it
in his style. After working with him on one film, it was quite
obvious that he could not or should not imitate the Roger Moore
style.
   ``Dalton brings something different,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity for us to write a different direction for Bond, using
Timothy's personality as a catalyst. Four actors have played James
Bond (Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Moore, Dalton) and each has
brought a new approach to the character. That's what keeps the
series contemporary and intersting.''
   The producer would not reveal the contractual arrangements with
Dalton, but he indicated that both the producers and cast would like
to see the association continue.
   And the next adventure for Bond?
   ``We'll wait for this one to get out, take a little rest, then
start all over again.''

<HEAD>Private Group Giving Military-Ruled Chileans Lessons in Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 16 years of authoritarian military
rule, Chileans are getting instruction on how to live in democracy
and preserve it after a civilian government takes over in March.
   ``We are convinced that democracy can only survive in Chile and
Latin America if all citizens take good care of it,'' said Monica
Jimenez, director of a $350,000 non-partisan educational project
called Participate. ``Citizens must understand that democracy is not
only a government system, but also a lifestyle.''
   From that principle comes Participate's motto: ``Democracy,
everybody's responsability.''
   Financing for the project was provided by the Costa Rica-based
Inter-American Institute for Human Rights.
   Mrs. Jimenez, a university professor and social worker, directed
a similar program last year called Crusade for Citizen
Participation, which won her an award from the National Endowment
for Democracy in Washington, D.C.
   That Crusade mobilized 200,000 volunteers across the country in a
door-to-door campaign to promote voter registration for October's
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend
until 1997 the presidency of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who took power
in a 1973 coup.
   The referendum obliged Pinochet to call an open presidential
election, which will be held Dec. 14. Pinochet is due to hand over
power to the winner March 11.
   It will be Chile's first civilian government since the coup, and
Mrs. Jimenez says Chileans, especially younger ones, must be helped
to face their new life under democracy, and, most of all, to
preserve it.
   ``Chile and Latin America have gone through long-lasting military
dictatorships which created an atmosphere of confrontation within
our societies,'' she said in an interview.
   ``We have been split among friends and enemies, so we have now to
create a new atmosphere where we all act as friends. A society where
we can have different opinions on many issues, and still be able to
sit around a table and talk and reach agreements.
   ``In other words, we have been able to realize that the other guy
may also have part of truth.''
   Mrs. Jimenez stressed that the program is ``completely
non-partisan.''
   ``We have some members of political parties working with us, and
we are also working with the Catholic and other Christian
churches,'' she said. ``But they are all committed not to let their
political or regligious beliefs interfere.''
   Participate has already trained 400 ``civic educators'' to
conduct the program. Those educators have trained about 3,000 aids
to work with them.
   Their job is to lecture ``a wide variety of groups in our
society,'' Mrs. Jimenez said.
   ``Reaction has so far been very good. Requests for our lecturers
are piling up from labor unions, religious groups, neighbors and
housewives organizations, sports and social clubs.''
   The workers are all volunteers and are picked mostly from among
university students and young professionals.
   Mrs. Jimenez said a preliminary evaluation indicates that
Participate's message is getting through.
   ``I think people realize that you often understand the value of
things once you lose them,'' she said. ``We lost democracy, and we
now understand how valuable it was.
   ``We are making clear to them that once democracy is back, it's
their responsibility to care of it, and they are certainly
understaing that.''
   Mrs. Jimenez said the Pinochet government's reaction has also
been positive.
   ``I see a general atmopshere of a better understanding now than
the one we met last year. Last year, a program such as our Crusade
was immediately seen as an anti-government action. Not anymore.''

   What lies in store for Americans when a dozen
West European nations open up their trading doors in 1992? U.S.
businessmen can't be totally certain, but many of them see
opportunity. This is one of a series of occasional reports on what
is in store in Western Europe when traditional trade barriers are
removed.

   American businesses are rushing to open
factories, snap up companies and sell their products to take
advantage of the giant consumer market that will be formed in
Western Europe in 1992.
   U.S. corporate executives are plotting strategy for the single
market that will be created when the dozen nations of the European
Economic Community get rid of the many trade barriers separating
them.
   ``It is no more business as usual,'' advises Data Resources Inc.,
a Massachusetts-based consulting firm.
   Businesses agree.
   ``1992 will happen,'' said William Gibson, president of Digital
Microwave Corp., a San Jose, Calif., company. ``Europe will look
very much like the United States.''
   ``The opportunities here are very great,'' said Chris Chaney,
sitting in the just-opened European office of Multiflow, a
computer-maker based in Branford, Conn.
   The date 1992 has become the catchword for the move by the EEC
trading bloc to allow the free movement of people, money, goods and
services among the 12 member nations. Its deadline for creating the
single, European-wide market is Dec. 31, 1992.
   Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, told Congress in
Washington recently, ``No other market is as important for American
exporters or our investors as is the market of the European
Community.''
   The EEC, also known as the Common Market, was the United States'
largest trading partner last year.
   American companies of all sizes _ and in a variety of fields _
want to get into the market under the deadline.
   ``1992 is now'' and companies need to get a toehold in the
European market, said Paul Sher, director of EEC affairs for Hill
and Knowlton, the U.S. public relations firm.
   Alfred Kingon, the former U.S. ambassador to the community, said,
``One option nobody has is to wait until 1992 to see what shape the
market is going to be. ... They have to do their thinking now.''
   Paul Provost, director of EEC public affairs for the American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said companies are investing money,
hiring employees and setting up research and development facilities.
   Some worry the community will set up barriers denying outsiders
access to its 320 million people.
   ``There is a fear that advocates of a `Europe-for-the-Europeans'
approach may succeed in delaying or taking charge of key elements of
the 1992 agenda,'' said James Robinson, chairman of American Express.
   ``That could lead to discrimination against companies of
non-European parentage,'' he said in a speech in Brussels.
   A recent U.S. Commerce Department report said American companies
should benefit from the single market. But, it cautioned, a danger
exists if the program is put into effect ``in a less than open
fashion.''
   California's Digital Microwave, which makes high performance
short-haul transmission products, doesn't want to be excluded.
   ``Our intent is to become a European supplier,'' said Gibson.
Last year, the company opened a high-tech factory in Scotland.
   The fear of ``Fortress Europe'' was much stronger last year. But
the EEC has tried to calm anxieties that it will throw up
protectionist barriers to keep others out.
   ``The whole Fortress Europe (concern) has cooled off,'' said
Eamonn Bates, EEC affairs manager for the American Chamber of
Commerce in Brussels.
   ``People have got more informed and now know a lot more about
1992. They realize it's not all bad news.''
   In a key move, the community backed off a proposal that appeared
to discriminate against foreign banks and financial institutions,
which do billions of dollars worth of business in Europe.
   Bates said U.S. businesses were encouraged that ``things can be
worked out if you deal with (community officials) properly.''
   The latest red flags have been hoisted over the community's plans
for regulating TV programming, industrial standards and government
purchases in the fields of telecommunications, water, energy and
transportation.
   Mrs. Hills has complained about the move to require that a
majority of entertainment programs shown on European TV be made in
Europe. She said it would ``almost certainly have a disastrous
effect'' on the American industry's earnings in Europe.
   The United States has also objected to a plan to let governments
reject bids for telecommunications products if more than half the
components were made outside the community. Such ``local content''
provisions also have surfaced in purchasing proposals for energy,
water and transportation.
   But big multinational companies with long histories in Europe say
they're ready.
   Since the 1950s, International Business Machines Corp. has
maintained a pan-European manufacturing approach.
   ``It made business sense to treat Europe as an entity,'' said IBM
spokesman John Wells in Paris.
   IBM has a dozen manufacturing plants in the EEC countries. More
than 90 percent of the products it sells in Europe are made in
Europe.
   Other companies are strengthening their positions.
   In 1986, American companies completed 89 mergers and
acquisitions, worth $1.4 billion, in the trading bloc, according to
Martin Sikora, editor of the Philadelphia-based magazine Mergers &amp;
Acquisitions.
   The number of deals rose to 107, valued at $2.4 billion, in 1987
and amounted to 82, worth $2.1 billion, last year. Most were in
food, pharmaceuticals, industrial equipment, and electronics and
computers.
   ``It allows larger, stronger, more aggressive companies to play
in this vast market,'' Sikora said.
   Whirlpool Corp. appeared to gain a firm base in Europe after
agreeing last year to form a joint venture with the major domestic
appliances division of Philips, the Dutch electronics giant.
   AT&amp;T and Philips set up a telecommunications partnership in the
early 1980s. And AT&amp;T linked up last June with Italtel, the Italian
telecommunications equipment maker, and STET, the state-holding
company that is Italtel's parent.
   Many Americans see a chance to boost their sales in the new
market, which is expected to force European companies to improve
their operations and become more competitive.
   Compaq Computer, a big maker of personal computers for European
businesses, sees an even greater demand in the single market.
   ``Companies are doing everything they can to position
themselves,'' said James D'Arezzo, marketing vice president for
Compaq's international office in Munich, Germany. ``We're reaping
that benefit.''
   To meet increased demand, the Houston-based company plans to
double the size of its manufacturing plant in Scotland.
   Stonhard, maker of epoxy industrial floors, wants to take
advantage of Europeans' increasing need for better factories, said
James Baldino, managing director of the company's European
operations.
   The company, based in Maple Shade, N.J., opened the Brussels
office in 1987 to expand its business and later got caught up in the
1992 push.
   ``For us, the timing could not be better,'' said Baldino.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The United Mine Workers of America, once known
for its brawling ways to settle coal strikes, is on the picket line
once again. Under new leadership, it is using a new tactic:
non-violence. In West Virginia, old-timers wonder whether the peace
will last.

   Curled wood shavings litter the bare dirt
under the awning over the picnic table. The shavings are the residue
of whittling, and sweeten the mountain air with an aroma of cedar.
   Horseshoe pits are handy. A basketball hoop occupies a nearby
utility pole. Jury-rigged wires from the same pole send juice to a
makeshift shack containing a card table, coffee maker, electric fan,
icebox. Four Rent-O-Lets are convenient. The sounds are of bird song
and a rushing stream, the Slab Fork of Rum Creek.
   Are West Virginia's coal miners on a summer outing?
   ``Hey, we're in a fight, not on a picnic,'' said Bethel Purkey.
``And it's one hell of a fight. But, yeah,'' he said, nodding,
``times have changed.
   ``We are now doing non-violent civil disobedience. Some of our
brothers and sisters have a hard time getting hold of that, but it's
working.
   ``This strike is going to be a new beginning for us, or an end _
but I don't see an end. I see us winning with this tactic and coming
back as strong or stronger than we ever were.''
   Purkey is president of Local 5815 of the United Mine Workers of
America.
   He is 40, a big man with thick, freckled arms and a bristling red
beard. He admits to having been in his share of brawls, as had his
father who was a miner, and his grandfather, who died in a cave-in.
But Purkey represents a new generation of leadership on the picket
line that is putting a new face on the UMW, one of the nation's
rowdiest unions.
   And he is right. Here in the coal fields of Appalachia, through
two months and more of the biggest mine labor dispute in years,
times have certainly changed.
   Time was, and not long ago, when a West Virginia picket shack
such as the one at Slab Fork would have been littered not with
perfumed cedar shavings but with spent cartridge shells and the
smell of gunpowder.
   ``The way they used to stop a truck in the old days,'' Purkey
recalls, ``was to turn it over and haul the driver out and give him
a good thumping. I've seen people shot at, ours and theirs, and
people thrown in the river, ours and theirs.
   ``Now we just stand there and ask the driver to honor our picket
line. If he says no we stand there anyhow. Or sit down. The trucks
have been turning around.
   ``We don't allow any alcohol on the picket line. We don't allow
anybody we don't know. We have a captain on every shift, at six
sites, 24 hours a day.
   ``Everything is under tight control and discipline. It's working.
I don't know how long it will keep working because you can push a
man only so far and we have been sorely provoked, but for now it's
working.''
   Purkey and others on the picket line say their new style of
conducting a strike has percolated down from the union president,
Richard Trumka, who, they say, has brought them a sense of pride and
dignity not felt since the glory days of union founder John L. Lewis.
   ``We have a smart man at the head of this organization,'' Purkey
says. ``I have faith in him. All of us do.''
   Purkey, along with 350 miners in West Virginia and 1,250 in
Virginia, have been on strike since April 5 against the Pittston
Coal Group's operations in both states. They went out after working
14 months without a contract. Another 300 Kentucky miners joined
them in June, and that strike touched off sympathy walkouts
involving 43,000 miners in 10 states in Appalachia and the Midwest.
   Fellow coal miners weren't the only ones, however, drawn to the
UMW cause.
   ``Your commitment to non-violence and the use of passive civil
disobedience has captured the attention of organized labor,'' said
Cesar Chavez, the West Coast farm workers' leader, at a recent rally
in Virginia. As long as the miners continue their non-violent ways,
Chavez predicted, the public would be on the UMW side.
   Public support as well as economic pressure clearly is the UMW
strategy. At that same rally, UMW vice president Cecil Roberts
declared: ``We've got the whole country on our side now. We are
winning this strike.''
   That remains to be seen. A more immediate question facing both
the miners and the coal industry is whether the current wave of
union support represents a newfound solidarity or the last gasp of
big labor.
   Back in the 1940s, under John L. Lewis, the union could call
500,000 members out of the mines and bring the entire industry to
its knees. After Lewis retired in 1961, the union began a 20-year
downhill slide.
   Lewis' successor, Tony Boyle, was sent to prison for ordering the
murder of a union rival as well as his wife and daughter. Boyle's
successor, Arnold Miller, watched a proliferation of wildcat strikes
splinter the union and hamper recruitment in the anthracite fields
opening in Western states. His successor, Sam Church, lost
rank-and-file respect by giving back a number of hard-won benefits,
one after a strike of 111 days, another of 72 days.
   ``For a long time,'' said Purkey, ``our people didn't really see
anybody up there they had much confidence in until Trumka came
along.''

   When Trumka was elected in 1982 by a 2-to-1 margin over Church,
he became the fourth president in 10 years of a union once known for
its stability. By then the UMW was down to 65,000 dispirited members
mining only 45 percent of America's coal, the rest mined by
non-union workers. The UMW, the nation's seminal industrial union
and once its wealthiest, was operating $400,000-a-month in the red.
   A 40-year-old lawyer and third-generation miner, Trumka brought a
fresh outlook and a new dynamic to the union. He negotiated a
contract in 1984 without an industrywide strike, the first one in 20
years. He did it again in 1988, all the while building up a $100
million strike fund.
   He also won authority within the union to call ``selective''
strikes against specific companies, such as Pittston, which withdrew
from industrywide bargaining and refused to sign the 1988 contract.
   ``Richard Trumka's ideas have won us two national agreements,''
says Purkey, ``so you have to believe that his way is the way to go.
If that means non-violent civil disobedience, that's it.
   ``We now have a small income while we're striking, $200 a week,
and health benefits. The wildcat strikers don't get that, just the
selective strikers because our strike is authorized.
   ``But every man has to show up on schedule and participate, just
like we were working. We are better organized than in any strike
I've been in and I've been in them all since I started in the mines
in 1971.
   ``We're holding rallies and demonstrations and marches _ a
completely different strategy, and it takes some getting used to.
Some thought the old ways were better, but now we all see that this
is better.''
   Apparently the non-violent philosophy takes some getting used to
by others than the strikers.
   At a recent court hearing in Logan, the district court judge,
Eric O'Briant, made reference to the mine workers' ``highly
sophisticated effort to peacefully prohibit trucks'' from driving up
Pittston's mine road at Slab Fork.
   The Pittston lawyer replied, ``...admittedly peaceful, albeit no
less disruptive.''
   In West Virginia's coal fields there is something almost quaint
about words such as ``peaceful'' and ``sophisticated,'' especially
in Logan County, where in recent memory strike tactics have been
about as sophisticated as a stick of dynamite.
   ``You have to remember our history,'' says Low Coal Chapman.
``This is where the hardest of the hard times began.''
   Chapman explains that his parents named him Robert, ``but if you
ask for me by that name nobody will know who you're talking about.
Just ask for Low Coal.''
   It is a miner's term for a thin seam of coal, maybe 40 inches
thick, where it takes unusual stooping and bending and crawling to
dig it out. Low Coal Chapman stands about 5-5.
   He was referring to an episode at nearby Blair Mountain in 1921
when company detectives, sheriff's deputies and federal troops
opened fire on miners marching down from Charleston to organize the
union in Logan County. Twenty-four were killed.
   Chapman, on strike at age 50, often hikes up the dirt road to the
top of Blair Mountain to reinforce his resolve. The view is
pulse-quickening and serene, offering no hint of the turmoil and
tension below.
   ``The men didn't make it over the mountain but their spirit
did,'' says Chapman. ``We're the children of that vision. I want
that dirt road to be named The Road to Solidarity.''
   Chapman was born and raised on Buffalo Creek, on the other side
of a mountain from Slab Fork. Buffalo Creek was where in 1972 a
faulty dam burst and wiped out the entire hollow. The torrent left
124 dead and 4,000 homeless. Chapman's parents, two sisters and
brother and their families were among the 4,000.
   ``Nobody has forgotten,'' he says, ``that it was a Pittston dam
that broke.''
   ``Low Coal is right about that,'' says Bethel Purkey. ``We have a
lot to resent about Pittston, them and their security guards.
They're trying to provoke us into doing something that will land us
in jail.''
   The security guards, a private firm, watch over the pickets,
continually filming them with movie cameras. Pittston says, however,
that the purpose is not to intimidate.
   At first the miners took the filming in good humor. One posed for
the camera in a Groucho Marx get-up. Others barked and cavorted like
puppies. Lately, however, it seems to have become less of a jokin
matter.
   ``They've followed me home, filmed my house,'' Purkey claims.
``They even filmed our ladies auxiliary at a meeting at the school.
What's that got to do with the strike?''
   Attempts to reach Pittston spokesmen for comment in West Virginia
and at the company headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., were not
successful. Repeated telephone calls were not returned.
   ``There have been times, buddy, when you're tempted to be
violent,'' said one of the pickets at Slab Fork, Dave Thompson,
whittling a stick, listening in the silence for the sound of an
approaching truck. ``Sometimes it's hard to keep yourself in
control.''
   ``We're determined to see this through with non-violence,''
Purkey says. ``But like I say, you can only push a man so far.
   ``You keep twisting the screw, twisting, twisting, at some point
that banjo string will break.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _Environmental groups are offering ``adoption''
plans for wild birds and animals, their habitats, and open spaces as
a way to raise money now that charitable donations are no longer
tax-deductible. ``It's a gimmick, a hook, because everybody is
hurting, everybody needs money,'' says an official of one such
group. It's also a gimmick that appears to be working.

   Donna Castle's fourth-graders in Milford, Pa., have adopted an
injured red-tailed hawk named the Red Baroness. Nine-year-old
Stephen Raba thinks of the hawk as his own.
   ``He talks about it all the time, about his bird. He takes it
personally,'' says his mother, Lynne Raba. ``When some of the class
went to see it, he was adamant that he had to go, that it was so
important. It's something that he takes a lot of pride in.''
   The students at Dingman Delaware Elementary School recycled $25
worth of aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearby
rehabiltation center for injured and orphaned birds of prey. The
children are hoping they can keep the Red Baroness on the mend until
she's ready to be released into the wild.
   Elsewhere, financial foster parents are being sought for a
manatee in Florida, baby puffins off the coast of Maine and
California gray whales in the Pacific Ocean. A Pennsylvania trout
stream can be adopted for an investment of labor, as can a Texas
beach and an Arkansas highway.
   Across the nation, environmental groups are offering ``adoption''
plans for wild birds and animals, their habitats, and open spaces as
a way to raise money anywhere nature is in trouble. The groups say
more and more people are adopting the wild through contributions.
   ``It's hands-on. It's strong and it's powerful,'' says Pat Noonan
of the Conservation Fund in Washington, D.C.
   ``The environmental movement is trying to reach out in creative
ways to enlist volunteer support and involvement, and adopt-a-tree
and adopt-a-whale are things people can identify with.''
   Jennifer Bates of the Whale Center in Oakland, Calif., one of
several organizations offering whales for adoption, says, ``It's a
gimmick, a hook, because everybody is hurting, everybody needs
money. After you donate to a couple organizations, chances are your
mailbox is going to be inundated, so you want to be the one piece of
mail folks will not throw out.''
   Zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for both
special projects and general upkeep, says Charles Wickenhauser of
the Pittsburgh Zoo, which recently raised $6,500 to build a new
penguin exhibit through a ``penguin parents'' program.
   ``I think the generation of baby boomers has less of a giving
tradition than our parents did,'' he says. ``We're trying to find
the trigger for their giving and trying to find it in
non-traditional ways, what unlocks the purse.''
   Adoption rates range from $10 to hundreds of dollars. The money
is used either directly _ to buy housing, medical care and food for
the adoptee _ or indirectly, to subsidize research, species
preservation, educational programs or lobby efforts.
   In exchange, foster parents usually receive a glossy photograph
and description of their animal, occasional updates about its
comings and goings and, just like Cabbage Patch dolls, a certificate
of adoption.
   But adoptions don't work for all environmental causes.
   ``You have to have something that's there and identifiable, that
you can photograph and put a name on,'' says Craig Van Note of
Monitor Consortium of Conservation and Animal Welfare Organizations
in Washington D.C.
   ``There's no way you can really adopt an elephant in Africa. In a
case like that, you'd have to tell the people their elephant got
killed last week, and that would be a downer.''
   A Florida native, Debra Brown, 33, of Orlando, was accustomed to
seeing manatees swimming in the state's shallow rivers.
   But it wasn't until she received an appeal to adopt ``Boomer''
that she became passionately involved in saving the gentle and
fragile animals, most of whom bear scars from boat propellers.
   ``If something happened to Boomer, you'd probably find me in
tears,'' she says. ``As big and, quote, ugly as manatees are,
they're beautiful.''
   Since the Save The Manatee Club of Maitland, Fla., began offering
adoptions in 1984, officials say membership has grown from 800 to
20,000 adults and about 60,000 students _ 80,000 foster parents in
all trying to save a species whose population has dwindled to about
1,200.

   ``Boomer is a manatee who's special to a lot of people now and if
something happens to Boomer, there are a lot of people who are going
to be upset,'' says club director Judith Delaney Vallee. ``It's now
their manatee.''
   Adoptions have become the lifeblood of many organizations, which
have been scrambling for funds since charitable donations were
declared no longer tax-deductible.
   Thanks to whale adoptions, the Massachusetts-based International
Wildlife Coalition, which monitors several endangered species, has
grown from three employees in 1983 to 22 now. In the past year, the
group sent out 86,000 humpback whale adoptions for $15 each, 50,000
of which were Christmas gifts.
   ``Our files grow faster than we can keep up with,'' says
coalition official Margaret King. ``People will send it as a gift to
someone else _ it's a great stocking stuffer. And it crosses all
barriers and countries. We have people in Saudi Arabia, France,
Australia who have adopted whales.''
   Sixty-six humpback whales that migrate yearly to the Cape Cod
area can be adopted. Individual whales are identified by unique
white and gray marks on their tails, so foster parents receive a
photograph of their whale's tail as it breaches the water.
   ``We really get cute letters from kids wanting to know if the
whale will fit in their bathtub or do they have to build a pool,''
King says.
   Schoolchildren are a lucrative market for environmental
adoptions, and many organizations gear their updates to children,
who not only learn about different species of birds and animals but
also environmental sensitivity.
   ``It's a huge market,'' says the Whale Center's Bates. ``Kids
have done some ingenious fund-raisers. One school took out a loan
from a bank, bought a large quantity of birdseed, repackaged it and
sold it to pay off the loan and adopt a whale with the proceeds.''
   In Ms. Castle's class, Stephen says he doesn't know how long
classmates will be able to scrounge up enough cans to keep their
hawk, whose wing was maimed by an errant bullet and is being cared
for at a nearby nature center. But Stephen says he knows why they're
doing it.
   ``So we can protect it and make the wing heal,'' he quickly
responds. ``It wouldn't be right if someone shot you.''
   Stephanie Streeter, who runs the Delaware Valley Raptor Center,
where the hawk is housed, says the center couldn't make it without
its foster parents.
   ``What's really nice is they can see what their money has
accomplished,'' she says. ``They can see the bird. It isn't a scam.
It isn't going to some fat cat sitting in a penthouse.''
   For those who have more time than cash, however, there are
adoption programs eager to capitalize on sweat equity.
   On their 50th wedding anniversary last September, Gregory and
Novaes Gregg of Clear Lake, Texas, picked up the garbage on their
adopted mile of beach on Padre Island as part of the state's
biannual beach cleanup.
   ``America was beautiful when we got married, and here we are 50
years later just trying to keep it that way,'' says Mrs. Gregg, 70.
   Within six months after the Texas General Land Office began the
program in 1986, all 172 miles of accessible beach in the state were
adopted by 30,000 ``weekend warriors'' who have picked up 1,055 tons
of garbage, says official Jeff Long.
   ``Our cleanup program is like a virus; it's very infectious,'' he
says. ``Some 25 states are now doing beach cleanups of some sort,
and many of those are modeled after our program.''
   The program's real punch has been in determining the source of
the garbage. Each piece of trash is cataloged by volunteers, and
that information has been used to enact legislation to stop the
polluters.
   Most beaches are adopted by social and civic clubs or companies
and business groups. But the Greggs and their daughter and
son-in-law adopted a mile on their own, and when the four get
together about once a month, they head to the beach with their trash
bags and check list.
   ``I don't think you have to be deeply motivated. It just takes a
little sense of responsibility. When you do something like this, the
end result is you yourself personally feel good,'' says Gregg, 74.
   ``We're not going to see a brand-new world, but we're going to
try to help it if we can.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide, Staten
Island is 2{ times the size of Manhattan. Yet, it is the smallest of
New York City's five boroughs in population, with 400,000 mostly
white, middle-class residents. Now with New York City reorganizing
its government to conform to the one-person, one-vote rule, the cry
for secession has risen once again on the island.

<TEXT>
   Across New York Harbor from Manhattan's elegant
towers, the turnaround point on a famous 25-cent ferry ride, Staten
Island is often derided as ``the world's largest garbage dump.''
   Be that as it may, many of the 400,000 residents of New York
City's smallest borough want to cut ties with Gotham's government,
figuring theirs is by far the better place to live.
   Secession? Improbable, say some. Impossible, others argue.
Inevitable, say a few die-hards.
   A renewed secessionist movement was prompted by a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in March that declared the city's Board of Estimate _
which awards lucrative franchises, contracts and land-development
projects _ unconstitutional under the one-person, one-vote rule.
   On the board, the borough president of Staten Island carries the
same vote as his Brooklyn counterpart, although Brooklyn's
population at 2.2 million is five times as large.
   The court ordered New York to create a new form of government,
one that will likely eliminate the Board of Estimate and emasculate
the offices of the city's five borough presidents.
   Those outside Staten Island, and some who live there, don't take
talk of secession seriously, and as a result, island residents and
local politicians find themselves the brunt of some more than gentle
ribbing these days.
   Borough President Ralph Lamberti has been referred to at city
hearings on the matter as the ``new George Washington.''
   City Councilman Jerome O'Donovan says he's tired of council
colleagues calling him alderman.
   And local secession activist Dan Singletary says he's even been
kidded by his daughter, who lives in Detroit. ``She saw a story in a
local newspaper, called up and said, `Dad, the world's largest
garbage dump wants to secede?'''
   To many, Staten Island and garbage are synonymous, thanks to the
Fresh Kills landfill, a sprawling 2,000 acre, 3-square-mile garbage
dump which is already 20 stories high at its tallest point, and
growing.
   ``Yes, we are the largest garbage dump in the world, but maybe we
want to be more than that,'' says Singletary, a transplanted
Chicagoan and artist who became active in community affairs during
his 20 years on the island.
   To those who live there, Staten Island, with its tree-lined
streets, green hills and wetland and wildlife sanctuaries, is the
last refuge from the concrete and condominiums of the rest of the
city.
   Nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide, it is 2{ times the size of
Manhattan (also an island). Its residents are 90 percent white,
middle- and upper-middle class workers, many of whom fled from
deteriorating Brooklyn neighborhoods after the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge opened in 1964, the only roadway linking Staten Island to the
rest of the city.
   ``We are not Manhattan-style people,'' says Les Trautmann, editor
of the daily Staten Island Advance, which has a circulation of about
90,000. ``We tend to be more family oriented.''
   That small-town feeling is reflected in the newspaper, which
Trautmann says without embarrassment does ``the chicken dinner
stuff,'' lists bridge club results and has a front-page column
devoted to good news.
   ``Everyone here talks about going into the city'' as if they
weren't really a part of it, says Trautmann, who describes himself
as a home-grown Staten Islander.
   ``Up until a few years ago, we even had people out in Tottenville
(an area of the island) who had never been to Manhattan, or any
other part of the city ...It's just a different type of place.''
   Most tourists know the borough only as the turnaround point of
the Staten Island ferry ride, a bargain excursion good for viewing
lower Manhattan skyscrapers and the Statue of Liberty.
   But if tourists looked beyond the drab and dingy docks, the
American Institute of Architects guide says they would find ``hills
as steep as San Francisco's, breathtaking views of New York Harbor
and Victorian mansions.''
   The street where Borough Hall stands looks like Main Street
U.S.A.; its neighbors include a small stationery store, country
furniture shop, luncheonette and white-steepled church.
   Staten Island also has miles of beaches, although many are
polluted; parks and playgrounds galore; 1,000 acres of protected
greenland; and the city's only historic restoration area.
   Still, Staten Island represents only 5 percent of the city's
population of 7 million, and New York Harbor serves as a wide moat.
   ``We have run into two kinds of people on Staten Island,'' says
Singletary. ``People who feel that the quality of life here has
changed so drastically that they see no reason to stay part of the
city.
   ``And a larger group of people who feel New York City is the
greatest city in the world and they don't want to leave unless it is
absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, that may be the case.''

   Initial proposals floated by the Charter Revision Commission, a
special panel appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch to revamp city
government, did not leave Staten Islanders smiling.
   It recommended eliminating the Board of Estimate and expanding
the City Council, the city's other main legislative body, from 35 to
60 members. Staten Island currently has two representatives on the
City Council and would pick up only one new member under the
expansion plan.
   In addition, the borough president's office would largely be
reduced to a ceremonial post. Community boards and local politicians
would have virtually no say if the mayor wanted to put jails and
homeless shelters in residential neighborhoods.
   Land development and city services have topped Staten Island's
list of complaints since it joined the Greater City of New York in
1898.
   Transportation, sewers, water service and the ever-present odor
emanating from the dump are the bane of Staten Islanders. On parts
of the island, water pressure is so low that on some days residents
with second-floor bathrooms cannot flush toilets.
   ``I would be for secession,'' says Richard Mahler, 30, a
technical service manager in Manhattan and a native Staten Islander.
``The island has changed so drastically since I was a kid.
   ``Woods have been torn down, condos and town houses are springing
up all over, traffic is a mess. As for crime, I don't even feel safe
letting my kids run around in the front yard alone. We didn't worry
about those kinds of things when I was growing up.''
   Mahler, who is weighing a move to New Jersey or upstate New York,
concedes that crime is a universal problem today and that island
development after the bridge was inevitable. But, he says, with
secession ``at least we would have some control over how the
island's changing.''
   Agitation for secession is not a new phenomenon. It flared in the
late 1940s, when residents battled city pols over the Fresh Kills
landfill, and lost.
   ``Whenever something goes against the grain of Staten Islanders,
someone yells, `Let's secede,''' says Loring McMillen, a lifetime
resident and official borough historian.
   McMillen, 83, has lived through all of Staten Island's secession
threats and thinks no more of this one than the others.
   ``I think it's a lot of wind,'' he says succinctly. ``I don't
think we'll gain a bit by doing it.''
   The real question may be, is it possible?
   ``We're not fooling ourselves that it wouldn't be a Herculean
task,'' says Kathryn Rooney, an attorney in the office of state Sen.
John Marchi, who has been leading the battle for secession.
   There are three ways Staten Island can secede: through a charter
change by petition, a proposal by the Charter Revision Commission or
an act of Legislature, which must be approved by the governor.
   The first two ways involves voters in all five boroughs ``and
chances of that succeeding are nil,'' says Rooney.
   Secessionists placed their hopes on state lawmakers. And on July
1, the Legislature voted to give Staten Islanders the right to vote
on secession in November 1990. Gov. Mario Cuomo has not revealed
whether he will sign the measure; he has said he does not want
Staten Island to leave the city, but he also says provisions must be
made to ensure the island has a strong voice in government.
   Beyond the political machinations of secession lies the question
of economic feasibility. Can Staten Island, which has virtually no
industry, exist on its own?
   Rooney, who co-authored a 1983 report on the feasibility of
secession, says the answer is yes. After paying current wages for
services such as fire, police and sanitation, she says, Staten
Island would have a $17 million budget surplus.
   She also dismisses critics who say property taxes would triple.
   ``Imagine what we could do if we were by ourselves, not part of
the city but so close to it...We could lower corporate taxes, impose
fewer restrictions and attract those businesses now leaving New York
for New Jersey. The possibilities are endless.''
   Ironically, the gargantuan and much-hated garbage dump could be
one of the island's biggest sources of income.
   ``Realistically, we'd have to continue the dump but there's also
no reason we couldn't charge the City of New York dearly to dump
their garbage here,'' Rooney says. ``It could be a real revenue
producer.''

   Lisbon, a charming but dilapidated
coastal city of seven hills, looks more like a teeming Third World
metropolis than the modern European capital it is.
   There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, the
well-used park benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men work
on the black-and-white tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through
honking, fume-spewing traffic. The people look sturdy, and not
particularly fashion-minded.
   This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on the
southwestern fringe of Europe, has to go to achieve its goal of
catching up with its neighbors. Now an overheating economy is
further imperiling that ambition.
   A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small
country's ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992.
That's when the 12-nation European Community, which Portugal joined
in 1986, becomes one barrier-free marketplace of 320 million
consumers.
   In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attention
eastward to the rest of Europe after hundreds of years of looking
across the Atlantic and into Africa and India.
   The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman and
Moorish conquerors, perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the
globe-circling empire that their famous explorers discovered five
centuries ago.
   Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed
mingling of black, brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in the
curry in Portuguese food, in the easy command of English in this
Portuguese-speaking country.
   After painful recession, austerity and more than 25 percent
inflation in 1983 and 1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamic
economies. Gross domestic product has grown 4.5 percent a year on
average for three years, and is projected to continue at 3.5
percent. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6 percent.
   A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debt
to $16 billion, down from 80.4 percent of GDP in 1985 to 40.7
percent.
   But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcing
unpopular measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's
center-right Social Democrats, who won an unprecedented majority in
parliament in the June 1987 general election, have lost support in
recent months.
   A poll recently published in O Jornal showed that the Social
Democrats down to 41 percent nearly halfway through their four-year
term from just under 50 percent in the election. The clean-cut,
49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation for being
abrasive and overly self-confident.
   The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36 percent
from 22.3 percent, and Socialist President Mario Soares, a
legendary, consummate politician, has become increasingly popular.
   Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the first
Portuguese leader to survive a full four-year term since the 1974
Revolution of the Carnations which ended 48 years of authoritarian
rule, mostly under rightist dictator Antonio Salazar.
   ``We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient
and competitive economy, a more creative and enterprising society, a
freer, more modern country, without being perturbed by those who
would like Portugal to turn back to the past,'' the prime minister
said in a recent speech.
   The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers
who are resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp
processing, fearing these will replace traditional olive trees and
threaten farm jobs.
   The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March when local
people trying to dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed with
national guardsmen.
   In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.
   Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of Portuguese
Industry, said, ``Now people tend to criticize the government a lot
and the mood is a very critical one.''
   Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo,
``I think we have a certain situation of crisis.''
   You hear it on the streets.
   Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ``Many people
are unhappy because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. The
cost of living is very hard.''
   But not everybody is negative.
   Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ``There
are more jobs. There is less poverty in particular than in the other
days.''

   Inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 12.3 percent, more than
twice the government's 6 percent target for this year, while the
trade balance went into the red last year, giving it a $5.9 billion
gap.
   Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent political
stability has unleashed long pent-up demand.
   To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11
financial measures which raised interest rates _ now at nearly 15
percent _ reduced banks' liquidity, and restricted the availability
of credit, particularly in the booming car sales market.
   Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, they
were attacked as late and misdirected. They have underscored the
government's tendency to intervene while simultaneously championing
free-market policies.
   ``Again, it is the private sector that is suffering,'' said Luis
Campos e Cunha, an economics professor at Lisbon's New University.
``They should be thinking of squeezing public expenditure.''
   Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent
policy changes and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and labor
laws restrictive. There are periodic public sector strikes.
   Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the Common
Market ahead of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested
$496 million in the year ended October, up significantly from $166
million in 1986.
   Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co.'s Portuguese operations, ``You have to keep plugging
away.''
   But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowed
into Portugal has proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabled
much-needed improvements to transport and communications to begin,
EC demands for Portuguese matching funds have worsened the budget
deficit.
   The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms,
including restructuring the capital markets.
   The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fully
recovered from the stock market crash, are being modernized and
combined into a national bourse. In late April, the government
launched an ambitious privatization program with the sale of a 49
percent stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer.
   ``We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels,
not just in the market but also in the financial institutions,''
said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet, the Lisbon Stock Exchange's general
secretary.
   But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected to
widen social divisions.
   Said Cavalheira Antunes: ``The idea of social solidarity is
regressing and the idea of everyone for himself is coming out on
top.''
   Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts.
   At some $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has the
worst literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates.
   Portugal imports 80 percent of its energy and, surprisingly, half
its food, even though one-fifth of the population works in
agriculture.
   The country is extremely dependent on tourism. Each year,
Portugal's population more than doubles as tourists flock in, mostly
to the southern Algarve coast.
   Other big industries tend to be traditional: textiles, footwear,
cork, forestry products, fishing, wine, and ceramics. Shipbuilding
and repair, and construction also are important.
   The experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios.
   If it's lucky and smart, Portugal could become Europe's
California by concentrating on exotic produce, high technology,
light manufacturing and tourism.
   If it isn't, foreigners might buy up Portugal's choice assets,
leaving it flooded with imports and producing the low-tech,
low-profit goods.
   The Portuguese, who are mostly Catholic, conservative and family
minded, have a reputation for being resilient in adversity and
flexible in the face of change.
   In particular, Portugal prides itself on successfully absorbing
some 700,000 Portuguese ``retornados'' and African immigrants who
fled to the country in the mid-1970s after Portugal gave up its
African colonies of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau.
   Optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederation's
Lacerda, who said: ``I think we are not going to miss the
opportunity of 1992.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a sad summer in Little Falls, N.Y., once
known as the smallest city in the United States with a Class A pro
baseball team. Alas, the Little Falls Mets moved to Massachusetts
this year and the New York village was left with a picture-perfect
ballpark standing empty. Baseball in Little Falls was truly the only
game in town.

   Lorrie Keefe doesn't know what to do
with herself this summer. ``Maybe I'll take up jogging,'' she
chuckles.
   Lorrie Keefe is a die-hard baseball fan, and she's not had much
to chuckle about lately. The outlook is bleak for baseball fans in
this village tucked in the rolling hills of the Mohawk Valley. A sad
silence has fallen on the patrons of the game: Mighty Casey has
struck out.
   The Casey in question, however, isn't the Mudville slugger from
Ernest Thayer's classic poem. It's Michael Casey, who bought the
Little Falls Mets last year and, when a better opportunity knocked,
decided to strike out for his hometown of Pittsfield, Mass., rather
than have his team play here at Veterans' Park, a field of dreams if
ever there was one.
   Michael Casey does have one thing in common with the smug
slugger, Keefe says: His sense of timing _ it's mighty ``rotten.''
   ``I didn't want to believe it at first,'' says the 53-year-old
Keefe, who lives a couple of blocks from the ballpark and only
missed a handful of home games in the 12 years the Mets played here.
``There's really nothing much to do in this town. It was really
quite a thrill having 'em here.
   ``I hate to look at it rationally. But when you spend that much
money (Casey shelled out $230,000) for an A team, and being as we
were noted as the smallest city in the whole United States as having
a franchise, I suppose I could see his point. But he certainly
didn't do it in a very good way. He could have given us a chance to
get another team in here.''
   Despite losing money in his first season as an owner, Casey
intended to stay in Little Falls for at least one more year.
However, that quickly changed when the Pittsfield Cubs of the Class
AA Eastern League decided to move last September.
   ``We realized after the loss we experienced that we were going to
be treating this as a business,'' Casey says, sitting in his office
at Pittsfield's Wahconah Park. ``We knew, and we were very upfront
with the people over there, that long-term we just couldn't see us
staying in Little Falls because of the investment that was made.
   ``We thought the Cubs would be here, but when it opened up we
acted, and we acted in a hurry.''
   That happened in mid-December, and Little Falls was left without
a team at the worst possible time.
   ``We thought at least if he stayed for the '89 season that would
give us a chance to look,'' says Mayor Michael Izzo.
   Casey may not have given them that chance, but his decision to
move to Pittsfield (population 50,000) appears to have been a
prudent one businesswise.
   Despite its awful reputation, Wahconah Park (in the past, games
have had to be delayed because the sun sets directly behind center
field and batters were unable to see the speeding ball) is looking
good these days. It's got a fresh paint job _ in the Mets' colors,
of course _ a new infield, new scoreboard, billboards galore, and a
screen in center field to block out the sunsets.
   Casey hopes to draw at least 50,000 for the season, which is
crammed in from mid-June to the end of August. Little Falls drew
just under 30,000 to rank in the middle of the New York-Penn League
in attendance last season.
   In one sense, Little Falls is a victim of a not-so-pleasant trend
in minor-league baseball.
   ``It seems to be going toward the bigger cities,'' says Oneonta
Yankees owner Sam Nader, who's been in the business for almost a
half-century. ``If we're really saying that baseball is America's
game, better not forget the people in the provinces. The days where
the community people are involved seem to be going by the boards.
Now we're getting entrepreneurs and people who are in it for ego
trips or whatever. It makes it extremely difficult for the small
community, which has been the backbone of this great sport, to
survive.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unlike the European gentry of another century who
put pinches of snuff to their noses to exact refreshing sneezes,
people who chew tobacco often suffer social snubs. Spitting in
public, however offensive, may have been tolerated, but not anymore.
Who has seen a spittoon lately? And that wad in a baseball player's
jaw is likely to be bubble gum.

   Chewing tobacco is like picking the banjo,
they say around here, a peculiarly American practice.
   So while cigarette manufacturers are battling declining sales in
the United States by opening new markets in Asia and the Third
World, the producers of smokeless tobacco still must look to the
homefolks.
   Luther Pittman, executive vice president of operations for
Pinkerton Tobacco Co. in Owensboro concedes today's chewing tobacco
market is ``a mature industry.'' He should know. He grew up on a
tobacco farm in North Carolina and has worked in the tobacco
business for 41 years.
   ``The only way we're going to get a lot of growth will be getting
business from our competition,'' says Pittman, whose company for
more than 100 years has been producing chewing tobacco with names
like Red Man, Spark Plug, Day's Work, Brown's Mule and A Man's Chew.
   ``Of course, they're trying to do the same thing.''
   That's not to say everybody has quit chewing and spitting.
   Despite the repeated warnings about the dangers of tobacco,
Americans still poked more than 64 million pounds of loose-leaf chew
into their cheeks last year, not counting the hard plugs of chewing
tobacco.
   Production of all smokeless tobacco products _ which includes
snuff _ declined from 133.7 million pounds in 1985 to 125.5 million
pounds in 1986, and slipped another 3.2 percent in 1987, according
to figures compiled by John Maxwell of Wheat First Securities in
Richmond, Va.
   One reason for chewing tobacco's decline, Maxwell says, is its
inconvenience and the way co-workers view spitting in public.
   ``It goes OK on the playing field, but it doesn't go over too
well in the office,'' he says.
   But even that wad in the jaw of a baseball player these days is
likely to be bubble gum. And who's seen a spittoon in service lately?
   Pinkerton's research indicates people who chew are mostly
blue-collar males, with use pretty well spread among people 25 to 55
years of age, Pittman says.
   ``We had always looked at our customers as being farmers,
construction people, miners _ people who use both hands in
working,'' Pittman says. ``It's easier for them to chew tobacco than
it is to smoke.''
   But the market may be changing slightly. Recent company surveys
show 20 percent of smokeless tobacco users have household incomes of
more than $50,000, he says.
   The Pinkerton Tobacco Co. is a privately held subsidiary of The
Pinkerton Group of Richmond, which is owned by Swedish Tobacco Co.
in Stockholm.
   Maxwell's figures indicate Pinkerton's biggest competitor for
loose-leaf customers is Conwood Co L.P. based in Memphis, Tenn.,
which makes Levi Garrett.
   Levi Garrett edged slightly ahead of Red Man in 1988, Maxwell
says, selling 17.95 million pounds to Red Man's 17.75 million pounds.
   Regardless of who the competition is, marketing is a big part of
staying ahead, Pittman says.
   The company advertised primarily on TV before the federal
government banned such ads. Now it uses newspapers, magazines and
promotional events, such as tractor pulls.
   It makes about 500,000 of the familiar Red Man caps a year for
promotional purposes.
   Pinkerton employs 520 workers at its plant in western Kentucky,
where it makes 14 brands of plug chewing tobacco, seven brands of
loose-leaf and nine brands of pipe tobacco. (Workers are not
required to use tobacco, but those who do are entitled to one free
Pinkerton product of their choice per day.)
   The fragrant smell of tobacco fills the packing room floor at the
Owensboro plant. Even ardent tobacco opponents probably would have
to admit the place smells wonderful.
   But while the fragrance is allowed to linger, scraps are not. As
workers run machinery and oversee packing operations, others sweep
up loose pieces of tobacco.
   ``People who come in here say they're utterly amazed at how clean
it is,'' Pittman says. ``But we're manufacturing a product people
use orally. We've got to keep it clean.''
   Inside the factory, a pouch of tobacco can be cut, folded,
filled, boxed and on a conveyor belt within three minutes. The plant
produces hundreds of thousands of pouches a day.
   The company's 2,000 wholesale customers order by telephone or fax
machine, and workers record the orders on a sophisticated computer
system.
   Here are some other facts about the chewing tobacco business:
   _Pinkerton, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1987, moved
its factory from Toledo, Ohio, to Owensboro in 1973.
   _Though Pinkerton uses Kentucky-grown tobacco in some products,
Red Man is made primarily from tobacco grown in Wisconsin and
Pennsylvania, with smaller amounts from Connecticut.
   _North Carolina leads in total volume of chewing tobacco
consumed. Kentucky ranks eighth.
   Heading a company that makes tobacco products isn't a problem for
Pittman.
   ``I've literally been in tobacco all my life,'' he says.
   ``I use all forms of tobacco. The only answer I can give is I'm
working in an industry that manufactures and sells a perfectly
legitimate, legal product supporting consumer demand.
   ``Tobacco has paid an awful lot of bills since the Revolution and
even before.''

   NBC's ``Hunter,'' a detective drama starring
Fred Dryer, is a show that is reversing a television trend.
   The usual course for a hit series is to reach a ratings plateau,
then slowly decline as the show becomes complacent and finally runs
out of steam.
   ``Hunter,'' which begins its sixth season in September, turned
that routine on its ear. ``Forget the first two years,'' Dryer says.
``They don't count. We're going into our fourth season.''
   The show has been climbing in the ratings, finishing in a tie for
16th place this past season. The stories have also gotten better and
have more substance. ``Hunter'' has bounced about the schedule, but
seems to do best on Saturday at 10 p.m.
   In the beginning, the ratings were lackluster. So were the
stories. The show was a blatant rip-off of Clint Eastwood's ``Dirty
Harry'' film character.
   Dryer, the 6-foot-6 former All-Pro defensive end for the Los
Angeles Rams, even closely resembles Eastwood. Hunter began as a
swaggering, unorthodox cop who carried a .357-caliber Magnum,
relentlessly pursued the bad guys and constantly fought with his
superiors.
   Stepfanie Kramer also stars as his partner, Sgt. Dee Dee McCall,
an equally hard-boiled detective who was nicknamed ``the brass
cupcake.''
   ``We've evolved way out from that,'' says Dryer. ``He's
unorthodox today if it's unorthodox to be compassionate, to live
your job and take it home with you. I credit Roy Huggins with
turning the show around during his time as executive producer. He
took a show that was making very small concentric circles and opened
it up and set up guidelines to make it bigger and better with more
emphasis on stories.
   ``What I contributed was to take those stories and tell them
through the characterizations of Hunter and McCall. The audience
must see how we react, how we feel about things. The relationship
between Hunter and McCall is drastically important. You must care
about the people you are watching.''
   More changes are due in the fall. Dryer and his partner, Lawrence
Kubik, will become executive producers.
   ``You're going to see a lot of subtle changes in communications,
in quality control and in post-production,'' Dryer says. ``Hunter
and McCall are moving away from the station house to Parker Center.
It'll give it a more contemporary, high-tech look. We're redesigning
the set and we're making it easier to film in. The old set
physically restricted where you could place the cameras.
   ``We'll do fewer car chases, fewer fistfights. Our stories will
have more to do with decision-making by Hunter and McCall. They'll
have more to do with the human condition, where one truth can
collide with another truth. Our scripts will be more accommodating
to good roles for guest stars.''
   As a football player, Dryer believed in preparation. He adheres
to that same practice as an actor and producer.
   ``The people paying you never see the preparation,'' he says.
``But that's the most important thing you do. I sit in on all the
story pitches and conferences. I have good writers and I rely on
their tastes and ideas, but I help them structure the stories.
   ``This is a collaborative medium and I enjoy that. I want to hire
people and let them do their job. But they can only do that if
everyone is clear on the vision we're trying to accomplish. It's
going to be my vision and my taste.''
   Dryer has his own production company and is developing films, but
he doesn't expect to have time for them until ``Hunter'' leaves the
air. He thinks the show will go at least another two years.
   Since starting ``Hunter'' in 1984, Dryer has made four guest
appearances on ``Cheers'' and went to Israel in 1986 to star in the
feature film ``Death Before Dishonor.''
   Dryer says first on his schedule after ``Hunter'' is to build a
new house with his own hands. ``I have a lot of builders in my
family,'' he says. ``My brother and I helped my father build his
house. If I wasn't in acting and producing I'd be in construction.
   ``The great thing is I can do other things in life. My life isn't
defined by the fact that I do `Hunter' or that I was a football
player. I want as many diversified experiences as I can have. If I'm
prepared for it it won't get by me.''

<TEXT>
   For six Mondays last spring, Mandy Patinkin stood
on stage at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Anspacher Theater
and sang his heart out.
   Accompanied by pianist Paul Ford, Patinkin went through an
eclectic yet very personal collection of songs, ranging from an Al
Jolson medley to Stephen Sondheim numbers to a mini-version of
Rodgers and Hart's ``Pal Joey,'' a musical he would like to do on
Broadway some day.
   The sold-out, 90-minute concerts proved to be among the hottest
tickets in town. Now he has brought that solo show, called ``Mandy
Patinkin in Concert: Dress Casual,'' to Broadway for a four-week run
(July 25-Aug. 19) at the Helen Hayes Theater.
   ``The whole idea was to create something that I love to do so
that I'm not wasting my life just waiting for other projects,''
Patinkin was saying the other day. ``I've waited seven months to a
year for something I wanted to do, and I got tired. You spend your
lifetime on the telephone and reading scripts, as opposed to
creating something.''
   Patinkin doesn't like to mark time. He's an intense, even
dangerous performer, willing to take risks in unusual projects even
if it means falling on his face. And he has _ most notably in ``The
Knife,'' David Hare's critically panned musical about a man who
undergoes a sex-change operation.
   But he has gotten back up. Until now, Patinkin has been best
known for his roles in Broadway musicals like ``Evita'' and ``Sunday
in the Park with George,'' or appearances in such movies as
``Yentl'' and ``The Princess Bride.''
   He also is something of a perfectionist. During his spring
concerts, he often stopped a number in mid-song if he felt it wasn't
being done correctly or when he bobbled a lyric.
   Much of the material in his one-man show comes from an album
released earlier this year by CBS Records. The recording was made in
consultation with Ford and Paul Gemignani, a veteran conductor of
Broadway musicals.
   Ford and Gemignani fed the singer lists of songs, nearly two
dozen of which finally made it to the recording studio. Patinkin
spent three or four months walking around the streets of Manhattan,
learning songs.
   ``I don't read any music,'' says Patinkin, a self-taught singer
who first started singing back in temple on Chicago's South Side at
the age of 8. ``I sit down with Paul Ford and my little cassette
recorder. Paul literally plunks out the notes with one finger in the
exact time, and I learn it. Then if I like the song, and it stays
with me, I keep working on it.''
   Among the numbers that finally were recorded were standards like
``Over the Rainbow'' and ``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' as well
as more obscure material such as ``Coffee in a Cardboard Cup'' from
the flop Kander and Ebb musical ``70 Girls 70.''
   Patinkin found the actual recording of the album cathartic.
   ``You're depressed or something, you go into a room and sing a
couple of songs and all of a sudden, you feel better,'' he says.
``People associate singing with being happy, and I think it's true.
When I sing, I feel better.''
   Out of the record came the show, born when Joe Papp, head of the
Shakespeare Festival, offered him the Anspacher. Patinkin was
already performing there, starring in Shakespeare's ``The Winter's
Tale'' six nights a week.
   It was on his nights off that Patinkin sang. The money raised
from the concerts went to the festival's free Shakespeare in Central
Park and Broadway Cares, an AIDS support group.
   ``People had a wonderful time,'' Patinkin says of the solo
experience. ``It was like being at home or in a studio. You can
improvise with just a piano player. You can do things over again and
try new things on the spot.''
   The Broadway engagement follows a brief sojourn in California
where Patinkin played a small role in ``Dick Tracy,'' the Warren
Beatty movie about the famous comic strip detective. In the film, he
appears as 88 Keys, piano player for Breathless Mahoney, played by
rock star Madonna. They get to sing several songs written for the
movie by Sondheim. ``Dick Tracy'' is expected to be released next
summer, and Patinkin has several other movie projects waiting.
   But for now he will concentrate on his Broadway show and possibly
more concerts with orchestras around the country after that.
   ``When I look back on those songs on the album and in the show,
they are all tales, either about the past, the present or the future
and concern things I like or have worked on,'' Patinkin says.
   ``In the case of Sondheim, many of them are reflections or
lessons on how we should live our lives. In the case of `Over the
Rainbow' and other songs, they are like dreams, what we hope for.
They all spoke to me in a way. They have to do with how I feel.
Maybe that's why I like them.''

   Archaeological exploration in Iraq has picked
up since the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, yielding rich finds
from the era 2,000 years ago when the powerful Assyrian empire
dominated the Middle East.
   The upsurge comes as President Saddam Hussein's government seeks
to bolster Iraq's self-image through excavation and rebuilding at
sites like Babylon that symbolize the nation's historical greatness.
   ``By appealing to history, Saddam encourages Iraqis to view
themselves as the heirs of a great civilization that flowered in
ancient Iraq while the surrounding world was lingering in
prehistory,'' a Western diplomat said.
   Iraq includes much of the ``fertile crescent'' of ancient
Mesopotamia where early rulers developed efficient armies and
sophisticated city administrations that rivalled the Pharaohs' Egypt.
   Ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone
sculptures, archives of inscribed clay tablets, delicate goldwork
and ivory carvings illustrate the importance of early Iraqi
civilization.
   To help build morale during the recent eight-year war with
Persian Iran, the Iraqi government recalled Assyrian and Babylonian
victories in the first millennium B.C. against the ancient Persians,
portrayed as unscrupulous aggressors.
   Although the war was halted last August by a United
Nations-mediated cease-fire, history is still being promoted,
underscoring Saddam's drive to boost Iraq's role in the Arab world.
   In addition to the Iraqi teams, archaeologists from the United
States, Britain, Poland, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan
were digging around the country earlier this year. Most will resume
work in the fall.
   Saddam also agreed in recent talks with American businessmen in
Baghdad, Iraq's capital, that a selection of ancient Iraqi treasures
would tour the United States.
   ``It's clear there's more than scholarship involved in all this
promotion of archaeology ... but the recent finds have been
spectacular,'' said a Western archaeologist, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   New excavations at three sites in the Assyrian heartland of
northern Iraq have unearthed a gold-filled royal tomb dating from
the 8th century B.C., as well as imposing sculpture and
architectural remains.
   At Nimrud, the Assyrian military capital 250 miles north of
Baghdad, Iraqi archaeologists found a stone chamber where two women
were buried along with more than 55 pounds of gold jewelry.
   Muzahem Mahmoud, the excavation director, said it was ``the
richest Assyrian burial known.''
   An inscription on stone in the tomb in wedge-shaped cuneiform
writing identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya, possibly the
daughter and grand-daughter of King Sargon who ruled an empire that
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.
   The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial
chamber: ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I
pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in
the scorching sun after death. ... Let the ghost of insomnia take
hold of him for ever and ever.''
   The gold jewelry included diadems, necklaces, belts, bracelets
and anklets, and 50 pairs of earrings, as well as a bronze mirror
with an enamel handle encrusted in precious stones.
   At Ninevah, the Assyrians' administrative capital, another Iraqi
team unearthed a stone door carved with four lions that was part of
the city's fortifications in its last days.
   They also found arrowheads and skeletons of Assyrian warriors who
may have died during a siege by the Babylonians and Medes. Ninevah
fell in 612 B.C. after holding out for two months and was destroyed.
   Outside the ruins, the archaeologists found remnants of an
irrigation system built by King Sennacherib a century earlier to
increase vegetation around the city, as well as a stone terrace
where he constructed what the tablets call ``a palace without
rival.''
   Farther north near the border with Syria, British archaeologists
tentatively identified a 100-foot high mound as the remains of
ancient Tillule, another important military and religious center.
   The team found the base of a ziggurat, a temple shaped like a
stepped pyramid, that may have belonged to a shrine for the Assyrian
weather god, Adad.
   They also located sections of two roads believed to be part of
highways linking Ninevah with Syria and Turkey.
   ``Everything here tells us that this is a major settlement,''
said excavation director Warwick Ball of the British Museum. ``It's
only a matter of time before we find the clues to tell us that Tel
Al-Hawa is the modern name of Tillule.''
   He said the Assyrians used Tillule as a center for massing troops
before launching campaigns against Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
   At Babylon, whose kings succeeded the Assyrians as rulers of
Mesopotamia, a major project is underway to excavate and restore the
whole nine-square-mile area of the ancient city.
   The multimillion-dollar restoration will include the palace of
King Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th century B.C. king who built the
legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of
the World.
   The city quickly grew into Mesopotamia's largest population
center with around 1 million residents. But Babylonian supremacy
lasted less than a century before the city was overrun by King Cyrus
of Persia in 539 B.C.

<HEAD>Valuable Antiquities Looted From Northern Cyprus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ancient treasures have been
looted from churches and tombs in the Turkish-held north of Cyprus
and authorities there say they can't stop a booming trade in stolen
antiquities.
   Plundered icons _ portraits of Byzantine saints _ are smuggled
out and offered for sale on West European art markets along with
3,000-year-old vases and delicate frescoes stripped from medieval
churches.
   ``Villagers wanting to make some money bring in an icon or pots
they dug out of tombs,'' said an antiques dealer in northern Cyprus
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There are regular buyers, local and foreign, who get the stuff
abroad one way or another.''
   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when the Turkish army invaded
and seized the northern one-third of the Mediterranean island
following an Athens-backed coup aimed at uniting Cyprus with Greece.
   The predominantly Moslem Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared
independence in 1983. But their republic is recognized only by
Turkey.
   After some 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled south, disused churches
were stripped of icons and other valuable furnishings. Some churches
were converted into mosques and others were used as warehouses or
stables.
   The European Parliament in December condemned what it called
``the continued destruction and pillaging of the Christian and
Hellenic cultural heritage'' in northern Cyprus and asked Turkey
``to respect what is a profoundly European cultural heritage.''
   Greek Cypriot officials claim more than 7,000 icons are missing,
as well as hundreds of ancient objects, including some looted from
private collections and others from storerooms of foreign
archaeological missions.
   Officials in the north insist they don't have the facilities to
prevent such thefts.
   ``Naturally, we're concerned. But we're a small state. We don't
have the funds to employ hundreds of guards to look after all the
sites day and night,'' Education and Culture Undersecretary Buhan
Tuna told The Associated Press.
   ``We do try, but the people who steal major items like the
mosaics aren't from the island. They're professionals from abroad.''
   Turkish Cypriot officials say they have about 4,000 icons in
storage awaiting display in a new museum and that they don't know of
any others. They say the private collections were catalogued and
locked up.
   But Cypriot icons, along with ancient vases and stone figurines
are frequently offered for sale abroad.
   Turkish antiques also have disappeared, among them a sword said
to have belonged to the Ottoman Sultan Selim II whose troops
conquered Cyprus in 1570. It was reported stolen last year from the
St. Sophia mosque, a Christian cathedral before the 16th century
Moslem conquests, in the Turkish sector of Nicosia.
   The Greek Cypriots have sometimes been able to retrieve stolen
treasures.
   ``Experts at some foreign museums and auction houses have been
very helpful,'' said Athanasios Papageorghiou, director of the
Cyprus government's archaeological service.
   ``They've notified us when Cypriot pieces turn up, and the
government or a private foundation has been able to buy them. ...
But that's only a fraction of what's missing, and more is being
taken all the time.''
   Papageorghiou said that earlier this year, rare 12th century
frescoes were removed from the church of Agios Filon in the north.
   ``We shouldn't have to spend money to buy back our own
property,'' he added. ``We can't afford to pay a huge ransom for
something.''
   Since Greek Cypriots cannot enter the Turkish sector,
archaeological service officials rely on diplomats, United Nations
officials and foreign scholars for information on what's
disappearing.
   However, Turkish Cypriot authorities allowed a Dutch member of
the European Parliament, Ymenus van der Werff, and a leading British
Byzantine expert, Robin Cormack of London's Courtauld Institute of
Art, to survey monuments and sites in the north in June.
   The Turkish Cypriots follow the Greek practice of licensing
private collectors who must register their treasures with the
authorities.

   ``Madame Sousatzka'' (MCA-Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   In ``Madame Sousatzka,'' Shirley MacLaine teaches piano and a
side course on life. Both are required classes for her students.
   MacLaine plays an aging, eccentric piano instructor who demands
total obedience and absolute faith in her methods. ``I teach not
only how to play the piano but how to live,'' she declares.
   In her London flat, musty and riddled with dusty relics from her
mysterious past, Sousatzka tries to mold and shape her aspiring
prodigies. But sometimes the young students are not as malleable as
she would like.
   The movie revolves around just such a conflict.
   Manek Sen, an Indian immigrant with a flair for the piano, is
brought to the madame by his mother, who sees dollar signs in her
son's budding talent.
   Manek, delightfully played by Navin Chowdhry, is a young man
struggling through adolescence, his culture and his gift. Madame
Sousatzka wants complete compliance; Manek would like to roller
skate on occasion with his pals.
   The rest of the film spins between these two revolving wills.
   MacLaine, shrouded in her colorful shawl and forever dousing
herself with perfume, reveals in the end that beneath her pedantry
is a lonely soul.
   Mankek, in turn, learns an important lesson in self-reliance when
he is forced to make a major decision for himself.
   There also are some intriguing subplots involving Peggy Ashcroft,
Twiggy and the other residents of MacLaine's building as they face
encroaching commercial development.
   But it's MacLaine who haunts the memory of Madame Sousatzka and
in watching it one can learn a few subtle and bittersweet lessons of
life.

   ``Stripped to Kill II'' (MGM-UA. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Stripped to Kill II'' is a mystery about a serial killer with a
lot of gratuitous stripping _ as one would expect from the title.
It's really not a bad movie, but the filmmakers seemed to think that
since the action takes place in a strip joint, they must focus on
that lost art.
   The story has a number of nice twists and a good buildup of
suspense as the climax nears. Unfortunately, the pace is constantly
interrupted by the obligatory disrobing of would-be victims.
   Interestingly, the biggest failure of ``Stripped to Kill II'' is
its misguided attempt at eroticism. What is intended as a tease is
merely a turnoff. The other major failing in the movie is the
stilted and cliche-ridden dialogue.
   But the quality of the filming is very good, with a nice smoky,
sleazy atmosphere in the club and its environs.
   The mystery is pretty simple, the Paragon club's strippers are
being killed one-by-one. Each has her throat slashed, and before
each murder, a stripper (Maria Ford) has a dream about the gruesome
death.

   ``Full Moon Fever'' (MCA) _ Tom Petty
   
   Judging by his first solo album, ``Full Moon Fever,'' it seems
Tom Petty's heart is no longer with the Heartbreakers.
   He's a Wilbury now. Brevity in lyrics and simplicity in music
seems to be the lessons he's taken from his tenure with the
Traveling Wilburys.
   ``Full Moon Fever'' can almost get an identical critical
assessment as the Traveling Wilburys' record: Both albums are filled
with breezy ``feel-good'' songs that are essentially lightweight but
sound terrific.
   All his fellow Wilburys, save Bob Dylan, make appearances.
Co-producer Jeff Lynne, who also had his hand in writing seven of
the 12 songs, is the most prominent.
   Petty's laconic nature is occasionally funny, like on this
perverse nursery rhyme from ``Yer So Bad'': ``My sister got lucky,
married a yuppie. Took him for all he was worth. Now she's a
swinger, dating a singer. I can't decide which is worse.''
   On the majestic melody, ``Free Fallin','' Petty says more in a
five-word chorus than many songwriters do in a whole song. Like on
Paul McCartney's ``My Brave Face,'' the narrator's joy at newfound
freedom from a relationship is mixed with despair at his loss.
   His cover of the Byrds' ``Feel a Whole Lot Better'' is a dead
ringer for Petty's own ``Listen to Her Heart.'' The tunes are all
relatively conservative pop-rock fare, except for the grungy guitar
of ``Runnin' Down a Dream,'' and the closing romp, ``Zombie Zoo.''
   Judging by the early sales figures, Petty's Wilbury work has
introduced him to an older generation of fans that might otherwise
have suspiciously looked upon him. He's stripped his music to the
essentials on ``Full Moon Fever'' to make that introduction that
much easier.

   Emancipated from teen-age movies, Andrew
McCarthy finds himself almost upstaged by a corpse in his new film.
   In ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman are
insurance company yuppies invited for a holiday at their boss'
palatial beach house in the Hamptons on Long Island in New York.
They arrive to find their host executed by the Mafia. The rest of
the movie concerns the two men's efforts to make Bernie seem alive
to his many friends and party guests.
   While some critics have called ``Weekend at Bernies'' a one-joke
movie, most admit that it is often hilarious. They especially cite
the performance of the corpse, who is actor Terry Kiser. There are
even predictions that the film could be the summer's sleeper.
   McCarthy admitted he had qualms about playing opposite a stiff.
   ``I laughed when I read the script,'' he said, ``but I also
thought, `This can be very morbid.' But somehow it all seemed so
harmless to me.
   ``Terry, who plays Bernie, is so good at it. He's one guy when
he's alive, and somebody else when he's dead. He's never dead,
really. It just takes the curse off it somehow. We treat him as if
he were just another guy.
   ``You find yourself laughing in spite of yourself. I saw the
picture and I did my usual cringing (about his performance). Then I
found myself laughing, it's so disarming.''
   McCarthy observed that Kiser ``didn't have any lines to learn, he
just lay there and got all the laughs.'' But Kiser did get tossed
around, and he suffered a few broken ribs that sidelined him for a
while.
   ``Weekend at Bernie's'' marks a departure for Andrew McCarthy.
   ``It was so refreshing for me because I'm used to playing a nice,
sensitive, moral guy who does the right thing,'' he commented.
``That can be a little boring, in real life as well as movies.
   ``I thought Larry (his character) is a terrific guy because he
thought he was very savvy and worldly and witty, and the babes loved
him. Of course he's wrong about everything. Underneath it all he's
like a scared little kid. But he puts on a wonderful performance for
the world. He's selfish in a lot of things, but he couldn't hurt a
fly.''
   McCarthy's early film career cast him as teen-agers in such films
as ``Class,'' ``Heaven Help Us'' and ``Pretty in Pink'' even when he
was in his 20s. Now 26, he minimizes the matter of the transition to
adulthood.
   ``That's one of those questions that other people seem to be
concerned about,'' he said. ``I played teen-agers because I was a
teen-ager. I played 20-year-olds because I was 20.
   ``I don't want to be 30 years old playing a guy who's borrowing
Dad's car to go out to the movies. But I think if you tend to
business, those things take care of themselves.''
   Born in Westfield, N.J., Andrew McCarthy started in high school
plays, studied acting at New York Universiry and New York's Circle
in the Square. After two years of schooling, he answered a cattle
call for the role of a preppie who has an affair with his roommate's
mother (Jacqueline Bisset) in ``Class.''
   His parents' reaction to his acting career?
   ``When I said I was going to college for acting, they said fine,
as long as I was going to college. When I called up and said I was
going to play Jacqueline Bisset's lover in a movie, my dad said,
`Bring her home to dinner, son.'''
   McCarthy, who recently bought a house in Greenwich Village, is a
confirmed Easterner.
   ``I love New York, I'm comfortable there,'' he said. ``I like the
pace, I like the environment. I'm not comfortable here. I don't like
getting in the car to go to the 7-11. I'm more comfortable where my
friends and family are.
   ``Here everyone I know eats, lives, breathes the business. Show
business. It's got its place, but not 24 hours a day for me.''
   About being a celebrity: ``In New York nobody cares, they just
care that they're going to beat you to that cab. People in New York
are just trying to get through the day, which is not necessarily
good. But I don't have any problems. And I don't travel in circles
that are very show-biz oriented.''
   McCarthy was leaving for France, where he will appear as the
young Henry Miller in ``Quiet Days at Clichy,'' directed by Claude
Chabrol. The actor will be appearing in a film unlikely to achieve a
wide release, at a fraction of his usual salary.
   ``It's one of those opportunities that is too good to pass up,''
he explained. ``To play something that is offbeat and work with
wonderful European guys and play a wonderful character. Knock on
wood, something may come of it that people approve of.''

<HEAD>The Artists: 50th Anniversary of Unprecedented Art Operation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``The Nude Maya'' did not make it this time. Nor
did the ``Clothed'' version and most other Goya paintings.
   Velasquez' famous ``Maids of Honor'' and El Greco's ``The Dream
of Philip II'' stayed away, too, as shipping them was considered too
risky.
   However, 73 other Spanish masterpieces that also survived Spain's
Civil War in 1936-39 are currently on show at Geneva's Museum of Art
and History, marking the 50th anniversary of an unprecedented
international art salvage operation.
   Shortly before midnight Feb. 13, 1939, 22 French railway cars
crammed with 1,868 crates rolled into Geneva's freightyard under a
pioneering accord reached at Figueras between an international group
of art experts and the Spanish Loyalist government.
   The cargo ranged from the treasures of Madrid's Prado Museum to
priceless tapestries and ancient manuscripts. The inventory filled
193 pages, listing 43 Grecos, 45 works by Velasquez and 138 Goyas
among the 1,300 paintings. Some had been brought over footpaths
across the nearby Spanish-French border before being put on the
railway cars in Perpignan.
   The addressee was Joseph Avenol, Secretary General of the League
of Nations, the Geneva-based forerunner of the United Nations.
Avenol, a French diplomat, reluctantly agreed to take charge of the
hoard, storing it at the vast library of the newly-built Palais des
Nations, now the U.N. Office in Geneva.
   Arduous negotiations preceded the transfer to Geneva, last stop
in an odyssey that began Nov. 10, 1936, four days before besieged
Madrid came under intensive aerial bombardment. Nine incendiary
bombs hit the Prado but the most important works of art had already
been removed from the museum.
   They were taken first to Valencia, then to the Barcelona region
and finally to Figueras where the accord to place the treasures
under the personal guardianship of Avenol was signed late on Feb. 3.
The signing was done by the light of matches because nationalist
bombs had caused a blackout, according to documentation prepared for
Geneva's three-month anniversary show by Spanish historian Arturo
Colorado Castellary.
   Avenol, sticking to the League of Nations' controversial
``non-interventionist'' policy, agreed to take charge of the hoard
only after an international committee of independent art experts was
formed to negotiate the transfer.
   The committee was headed by David David-Weill, president of
France's Council of National Museums, who also contributed most of
the private donations which funded the operation. It included
British, French, U.S., Dutch, Belgian and Swiss members.
   At the last minute, the Spaniards had a clause inserted which
stipulated that once peace was reestablished, all objects must be
returned ``only to the government of Spain to remain as the common
property of the Spanish nation.''
   In his memoirs, Loyalist Foreign Minister Julio Alvarez del Vayo
wrote this was meant to make sure that the national patrimony would
not wind up ``in the hands of Hitler and Mussolini'' who backed the
nationalist insurgents with bombers and ground forces.
   Suggestions to send the paintings to the United States had
already been declined in 1937 because of Washington's growing
sympathy with the insurgents led by Gen. Francisco Franco, according
to Alvarez del Vayo. Only a few weeks after the Figueras accord,
Franco brought all of Spain under his control.
   The new nationalist government demanded the immediate return of
the art treasures. On May 10, a special train left Geneva for Spain
with all but 196 objects. Two days earlier, Spain had withdrawn from
the League of Nations, following Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.
   At the request of the Geneva authorities, the new Spanish regime
agreed to leave temporarily behind 175 paintings and 21 tapestries
to be shown at an exhibition that made Geneva, ``the cultural
capital of Europe,'' as an enthusiastic comment in the local press
put it.
   The exhibition that ran for exactly three months became the
biggest art event of which Switzerland was ever host. More than
400,000 visitors, including ex-King Alfonso XIII of Spain and the
Duke and Duchess of Windsor, admired the exhibits in Geneva's Art
and History Museum. The net profit, 350,000 Swiss francs, equivalent
to about 1,750,000 francs today or $1 million, went to Spain.
   The exhibition closed Aug. 31, at 10:30 p.m. Seven hours and 10
minutes later, Adolf Hitler announced that German troops had invaded
Poland, marking the outbreak of World War II.

   Jackson Browne has sold millions of records with
songs based on the promise of good times.
   He's also capable of poking fun at the Cold War with ``Lawyers in
Love,'' performing a spirited cover of the golden oldie ``Stay'' or
bringing audiences to their feet with ``Running on Empty.''
   But rather than telling tales of '57 Chevys and teen angels,
Browne prefers prayers for pretenders and demands for peace and
justice.
   ``Sometimes offering a prayer is a way of focusing your hopes and
aspirations and appealing to forces outside of yourself,'' the
40-year-old musician said. ``That's what some of these songs are at
times.''
   In the 1970s, Browne was part of a new wave of artists emerging
from California that included the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie
Raitt and Warren Zevon. But he's transformed from a
singer-songwriter of the ``me'' generation to political activist,
openly embracing civil rights, anti-apartheid forces in South Africa
and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   ``I have more interests now,'' said Browne, who lives with
actress Daryl Hannah. ``I don't know if that's a function of aging,
or that many of the other issues in my life are settled, or on the
way to being settled.
   ``I was beginning to hear about Central America. Working in the
'70s on ecological and environmental issues, you come face to face
with government duplicity.''
   He began reading, attending lectures and traveling. Political
commitment has dominated his last two records, ``Lives in the
Balance'' and ``World in Motion.''
   Browne combines folk, hard rock and reggae with attacks on
President Reagan, and tributes to the people of Central America and
South Africa.
   ``Most music has a political context,'' Browne said, ``whether
it's on the surface or not, whether people recognize it as such. In
the United States, there's an old quote, `If you got a message, try
Western Union.' I don't think it's true in Latin America where the
political songs are very powerful.''
   But despite his passion for the rights of all people, his
audience remains predominantly white. He cited style as a major
problem.
   ``It could depend whether or not you're speaking in the same
language,'' Browne said. ``If you want to find a form of music that
is talking about a lot of the same things, but to that audience,
it's rap. There's real political music going on in the United
States: Public Enemy, KRS-One _ hundreds and hundreds of bands
describing life as it is.''
   On ``World in Motion,'' he covers ``My Personal Revenge,'' a song
co-written by Tomas Borge, the Nicaraguan Minister of the Interior.
Browne heard a tape of the song while driving outside of Managua and
was impressed by its message of forgiveness.
   ``Borge had been tortured by the National Guard. As he left the
prison he was tortured in, he said he would be back for his revenge.
Three or four years later, after the Sandinista revolution (in
1979), he found himself looking through the prisoners for this man
who had tortured him,'' Browne said.
   ``He found himself amongst a bunch of people who had been working
in the very same prison. He found the man who had tortured him, told
him he would now take his revenge and began reading the poem.''
   The world seemed much simpler for Browne when he released his
debut album, ``Saturate Before Using,'' in 1972. He was just another
unknown young songwriter, hoping his throughtful lyrics and spare
arrangements would attract attention.
   ``It wasn't so much a busines then,'' Brown recalled. ``As I
wrote my early songs, I was aware of not being able to tell whether
somebody would like it. I remember thinking, `Wouldn't it be great
if people might want to hear my songs, come to a club and see me
play?'''
   His appeal widened in 1976 with ``The Pretender.'' While
recording the album, his wife committed suicide and Browne poured
his heart into the title track, ``The Fuse,'' and ``Here Come Those
Tears Again.''
   ``There are songs I think were too introspective,'' Browne said.
   ``At first, I always used a narrative form. Like `Song for Adam,'
it's more or less true what I was saying. I was trying to connect
what happened to him with my own life.
   ``That was on my first record, but by the time of my fourth
record, people begin reading about your life in Rolling Stone and it
becomes difficult to use the narrative form. It stops being about
anybody's life and starts being about your life.''
   He loosened up for the live ``Running on Empty,'' and was stunned
when the record went platinum.
   ``It was not my best work,'' he said. ``It wasn't as serious an
album as `Late for the Sky' and `The Pretender.' It was a suspension
of values, a break from what I'd been talking about. It just
decribes a certain kind of life. There's very little of the depth of
the previous records.''
   Browne remains inspired by the protest music of the '60s and
tries to write in the same spirit.
   ``Rock 'n' roll is supposed to be rebellious. So much of what is
considered rebellious today is so patented, tried and true. Heavy
metal acts are not rebellion, it's rebellion against a very, very
tame picture of order,'' he said.
   ``Some songs from the '60s, like `Mr. Tambourine Man,' implied
freedom and values that were present in rock 'n roll. You couldn't
find it in the straight culture. I would accept that definition of
my music as subversive.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Trip of a Lifetime</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Want to attend the Sermon on the Mount? See the
premiere of Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night?'' Help angry patriots
dump tea into Boston Harbor?
   If so, then Dorothy Curley has the trip of a lifetime, in the
lifetime of your choice.
   Traveling back in time to witness the world's more momentous
occasions is the premise of Curley's new fictional book, ``The
Complete Time Traveler: A Tourist's Guide to the Fourth Dimension.''
   ``We supposedly wrote the book 50 years from now,'' she said.
   Curley, co-author Howard Blumenthal and illustrator Brad Williams
explain in ``The Complete Time Traveler'' that this anniversary
edition is being offered 50 years prior to publication to help
improve understanding of time travel before its supposed
implementation in the year 2027.
   The revised guide, they say, is based on their own frequent
sojourns into the past as 21st-century time travelers.
   ``Time travel is now the nation's top leisure time activity,''
the authors write in the book's introduction, dated 2038. ``With
minimal preparation and your choice of time machine, you can be
assured of a safe and rewarding trip to the location and era of your
choice.''
   But time travelers beware. You can't tamper with the past.
   ``It's safer to just say you can't change the past, just for
dramatic purposes,'' Curley said. ``Otherwise, we couldn't send
anybody back to do anything because we wouldn't be there.''
   You also can't slip into the future, according to ``The Complete
Time Traveler,'' unless you're willing to stay there for good.
   ``The first thing that's going to happen when time travel is a
reality is that the government's going to take over and tell you
what you can do and what you can't do,'' Curley said in an interview.
   That regulating agency, according to the book, is the Federal
Time Travel Commission.
   ``If you know what stock is going to do what, or what horse is
going to win or what lottery number is going to hit, then basically
the world economy would collapse,'' Curley said. ``Plus you could
travel to the future and see your own death. That would be pretty
weird.''
   Weirdness aside, ``The Complete Time Traveler'' is the first
credible attempt to assume time travel is real ``and then play with
it,'' said George Young, editor-in-chief of Ten Speed Press. The
Berkeley, Calif., publisher released 7,500 hardback copies of the
212-page book early this year. A paperback edition is being
considered, as well as a sequel.
   ``It takes that assumption and gives it a totally different
twist,'' Young said. ``It's like somebody came up with a dictionary
for a language that doesn't exist.''
   Curley, 35, a free-lance television producer, director and writer
who lives on a 133-acre farm in southwestern Pennsylvania, became
fascinated with the idea of time travel as a child. But it wasn't
until she was explaining it in 1985 to her friend, Blumenthal, an
author and syndicated columnist in Sea Cliff, N.Y., that she decided
to write a light-hearted treatise on the subject.
   ``There's something here for people ... who need something new to
play with their minds,'' Blumenthal told her.
   The two sent a 40-page proposal to New York publishers, who liked
the idea but told them the work couldn't be categorized so they
couldn't put it out.
   Curley admits the book is difficult to describe.
   ``It's not really parody and it's not really satire,'' she said.
``I can tell you everything it's not. I really have trouble defining
what it is. It's more imagination.''
   In mid-1987, Ten Speed gave Curley and Blumenthal one year to
write ``The Complete Time Traveler.'' During a brainstorming
session, the authors came up with their own version of time travel:
a belt that enables people to slip inside wormholes by raising the
body's vibration level to that of a wormhole.
   While there is no proof wormholes exist, some physicists believe
the supposed holes in space and time possibly could be used as a
tunnel to return to another era or to travel to distant parts of the
universe. That notion has its roots in Albert Einstein's special
relativity theory which deals with the relationships among space,
time, matter and energy, and includes his formula: Energy equals
mass times the speed of light squared. The theory says the speed of
light is constant regardless of whether the source of light is
moving. Curley spent weeks acquainting herself with the latest
scientific thought on time travel. She also frequented the local
library to gather historical trivia for her chapter on time travel
destinations.
   She learned, for example, that Julius Caesar banned delivery
carts in the daytime because of traffic jams, forcing carts to be
unloaded at night. Time travelers, therefore, are advised to nap
during the day when visiting Rome in the first century B.C.
   She also learned that during the Indianapolis Speedway's opening
on Aug. 21, 1909, Charles Merz's car blew a tire on the south turn
of the last race, killing two spectators and a mechanic. Time
travelers consequently are urged to avoid the south turn area.
   The authors found the No. 1 attraction in Earth's history to be
Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
   ``What we decided,'' Curley explained, smiling, ``is that of
these many, many, many thousands of people who were there, there
were really only about 22 natives. The rest were all tourists.
Because how did all those people know when to show up?''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Gailard Sartain _ a Once Rejected Actor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gailard Sartain tried out for acting
roles in high school and college, but never made the cast.
   But he didn't give up on his ambition to become an actor. Thanks
to his perseverance, he's become a familiar face on TV and in movies
during the past 17 years.
   The rotund 44-year-old performer has been doing skits since 1972
on ``Hee Haw,'' the syndicated country music-humor show on TV. He's
also appeared in 23 movies, most recently portraying a sheriff in
``Mississippi Burning.''
   He didn't get discouraged after being rejected for parts in
productions while in high school in his native Tulsa, Okla., and at
the University of Tulsa.
   ``I tried out for stuff, but never got in,'' Sartain recalled in
an interview at a TV studio in the Grand Ole Opry House as he
awaited ``Hee Haw'' tapings to resume.
   ``I wasn't in the right clique or in the theater department,'' he
said. ``Even in high school, there was a clique. At the college
level, it was a major clique, and if you weren't a drama major, you
might get to play a doorstop or something.''
   He first got noticed in the early 1970s while doing some comedy
routines as host of late-night movies on a Tulsa TV station. This
led to ``Hee Haw,'' and his ``Hee Haw'' skits led to dramatic motion
picture roles.
   He portrayed the Big Bopper in ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' and
also was in ``Hard Country'' with Jan-Michael Vincent and Kim
Basinger, ``Roadie'' with Art Carney and Meat Loaf and ``The Jerk''
and ``All of Me,'' both starring Steve Martin.
   On ``Hee Haw,'' he's best known as the bumbling Maynard in a
general store segment, and Hammerhead in a spot about a hotel. He
also has been in segments originating in a flea market and a truck
stop. This fall, he'll be seen in two new spots: ``Eyewitless News''
and the Kornfield Kounty Kourtroom.
   Because of his comedy work in the cornpone ``Hee Haw,'' some
people didn't recognize him as the sheriff in ``Mississippi
Burning.''
   ``I've been told people don't believe I was the sheriff,''
Sartain said. ``They say, `No, not Maynard. What are you talking
about?'''
   He considers his work in ``Mississippi Burning'' as his best to
date.
   ``It's a quality film and I enjoyed it. It was a real departure
for me. A couple of scenes of mine were brutal. There was an
undercurrent of hatred and hostility. It was a gigantic departure
from `Hee Haw.'''
   He has already finished two other movies that will be released in
coming months _ ``Blaze,'' starring Paul Newman, and ``Love at
Large,'' starring Tom Berenger.
   He enjoys the camaraderie of ``Hee Haw,'' which is taped in June
and October, thus permitting him to accept movie roles the rest of
the year.
   ``It's a family feeling,'' Sartain said. ``You don't have to
force anything. It's like a giant birthday party.''
   He believes the show has lasted since 1968 because of the
relaxing feeling it projects.
   ``Once you become acclimated to the show, it's comfortable. It's
a literal institution as far as television goes. I think people know
what to expect and like it.''
   The longevity of the show has surprised even him.
   ``I felt 15 years ago that I had one year left. Now, it could go
on another two months or 10 years. It depends on who is left
standing.''
   The one-hour show, starring Roy Clark, has featured virtually
every major country music star down through the years. It is seen by
about 13 million viewers on more than 200 stations in this country
and Canada, usually early Saturday night. Even if it were to end
production today, it would have vaults of programs to use for reruns.
   ``It's a real pleasant thing to do,'' Sartain said about the show.
   Prior to doing the Tulsa TV show, he was a writer-illustrator for
Hallmark Cards for about a year. He still is interested in painting.
   ``In 1985 I sold about half of my 18 pieces,'' he said. ``Now I
miss them. They were like my kids.''

   Fashion-watchers from New York to Tokyo have been
spotting battalions of quilted chain bags, gold buttons and
braid-piped suits _ all familiar Chanel symbols.
   You might even see a hairy man wearing a Chanel T-shirt, an
incongruous offshoot of the newest wave of the Chanel cult.
   ``Coco'' Chanel died in 1971, but her designs never seem to go
out of style, and imitators have scrambled to make hay from the
recent boom. The plethora of fakes infuriates the House of Chanel,
currently suing copyists right and left.
   But as Chanel said, ``My ideas belong to everyone.'' And the
Chanel craze goes on apace.
   Nowadays, the Chanel look connotes both status and chic, even
when runway shows are updated with wild departures from the old
formulas by the house's designer, Karl Lagerfeld.
   In her heyday, Chanel was a revolutionary. At a time when
``proper'' post-Victorians were still gussied up in feathers and
corsets, Chanel was busy ridding clothes of extraneous trappings,
stripping them down to the basics, then dressing them up with pearls.
   Born in 1883 to a poor family in central France, Gabrielle Chanel
worked her way to the top as she discovered high society through her
lovers.
   Her lifelong sobriquet of Coco came from a song, ``Co-Co-Ri-Co''
(cock-a-doodle-do), she sang at a music hall in Vichy. Clever with
her hands, she loved dressing up in her own homemade costumes.
   By 1913, an English admirer named ``Boy'' Capel had set her up in
a milliner's shop in fashionable Deauville.
   Too proud to imitate the wealthy women she met, Chanel set her
own styles, and soon everyone was copying her pared-down elegance,
her jaunty boater hats, her middy-collared dresses.
   Other designers like Poiret and Vionnet were loosening up on
their clothes by 1914, when World War I began. But it was Coco who
best caught the spirit of the jazz age. She openly flouted
conventions at a time when other women began wanting more freedom,
and her clothes suited the new mood.
   Women flocked in from the Ritz across the street when she opened
her shop in the Rue Cambon in 1919. As the Twenties roared in to the
Charleston, Chanel _ with her relaxed, assured manner and clothes to
match _ had an instant success. As she put it, ``I woke up famous.''
   Her own best model, she shortened her skirts, wore long cardigans
with pockets, and bobbed her long hair. Masses of women followed
suit.
   She pioneered pants for women, with flowing pajamas worn by Garbo
and Dietrich on the flickering screen. She made the little black
dress a glamour item with many strands of imitation pearls.
   Always ``Mademoiselle'' to her staff, she never married any of
the celebrated men who courted her. If her heart was broken, she was
unbowed, toiling on as a ceaseless perfectionist.
   After World War II, Chanel moved to Switzerland, where she kept
company with a German officer.
   Her attempted comeback in 1954 met with sullen press commentary.
Dior's 1947 New Look sensation had still not worn off, and the
fashion mavens wanted more exciting news than Chanel's quiet little
suits brought.
   But Chanel didn't stay long in the shade. The time was ripe for
her outfits, which were both comfortable and glamorous without
looking stiffly sophisticated.
   Women in the street were tiring of the New Look and loved
Chanel's style, especially the braid-edged suits with quilted
linings.
   By the time she died at 87, she had twice won and then held her
place at the top of the fashion heap. The House of Chanel coasted on
her old models and reputation until 1983, when German-born Lagerfeld
came sweeping in like a bracing blast of fresh air. And Chanel was
hot news again.
   Lagerfeld's odder innovations, like 18th-century-style panniers,
have shaken up some steadfast Chanel fans.
   But there's always an identifiable Chanel suit in the collections
to please conservatives. And Lagerfeld has blown up Chanel details _
chains, pearls, the crossed C logo _ into a fetish that borders on
high camp.
   He sees the current craze as ``suited to today's rock culture in
the chains and leather, allied to the Chanel cachet, which is a
passport for respectability.''
   ``Chanel accessories simply work,'' says Ellin Saltzman, fashion
director of Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. ``The bags hang right on
your shoulder and the chains and buttons dress up anything.''
   Working women love Chanel, as it is both serious and
feminine-looking. ``Fashion exaggeration like baby doll and vamp
looks don't go down well in an office,'' says Chantal Clayeux, a
French government employee. ``Chanel does.''
   The best of Chanel looks right in almost any situation. As Coco
Chanel herself once observed: ``An elegant woman must be able to do
the marketing without making the other housewives laugh. The ones
who laugh are always right.''

   U.S. President George Bush helps a Hong Kong
tailor advertise his shirts, while Henry Kissinger and entertainers
Robert Wagner and David Bowie promote suits at another establishment.
   They may not realize this, but their photographs are prominently
displayed to encourage business at the shops where they had clothes
made on visits to this British colony.
   ``Kissinger is a good customer, and he comes back every two
years,'' said an employee at Sam's Tailor, which also boasts as
regular customers a collection of British bluebloods and other world
figures.
   At the shop, where photographs of prominent customers share space
with bolts of suit material, all the employees answer to the name
Sam. But the owner, a 65-year-old Indian from Bombay who began the
business in l950, is known as ``The Sam.''
   ``We don't keep a camera. The customers bring their photographers
and send us the pictures,'' Sam's elder son said in an interview.
   At Ascot Chang Co. Ltd., which specializes in shirts, there's a
picture of Bush, who squeezed in an appointment in l985 when he was
vice president and stopped over in Hong Kong for 20 hours.
   ``He called and asked us to go up to his hotel room for his
measurements,'' said manager Tony Chang, whose father started the
business more than 30 years ago. ``He is very classic. He likes pure
colors, especially light blue.''
   Chang said Bush later placed several mail orders for shirts, but
he now gets them from a branch office which Ascot opened in New York
two years ago.
   Bush paid about $51.30 for each shirt during his Hong Kong visit,
and his mail order shirts cost about $97 each because of mail and
import charges, said Chang.
   ``The shirts cost $118.50 in the States because of taxes,'' he
said.
   With the variety of imported fabrics readily available in Hong
Kong, the colony has long had a reputation for its tailor-made
suits. The Hong Kong Tourist Association says there are more than
2,500 tailor shops in Hong Kong.
   But tailors say the once famous 24-hour suit _ ``Measured at
breakfast, served with the next breakfast'' _ is now discouraged by
reputable tailors who take pride in their work and prefer customers
to allow at least three days for two fittings.
   John Wang, a director of Robert Tailoring and Co. Ltd., in the
luxurious Mandarin Hotel, said it normally takes three days to make
a suit, but tourists pressed for time can have their orders mailed
without extra charge.
   ``We pay the tailors double for an urgent order, but we do not
charge this to customers, otherwise they will not come back,'' said
Wang. He said 80 percent of his business involves regular customers,
both tourists and Hong Kong residents.
   Prices for suits vary, depending on style and material, but they
usually range between $192 and $385, the equivalent of a suit bought
off the rack in some countries, tailors say.
   Stephen Young, a furniture salesman from Portland, Maine, spent
four days in Hong Kong recently and decided on the day before his
departure to order a suit.
   ``Everybody said I should have a suit made in Hong Kong, so I
did,'' he explained.
   But he wanted a special material _ super 120s tuxedo cashmere and
mink. He visited several tailor shops before he found one that
stocked the fabric.
   He was immediately measured, had a fitting before his departure,
and was promised the suit by mail within three weeks. The suit cost
$512, but Young said it would still be cheaper than a ready-made one
in Maine.
   Also, he added, ``They don't have it tailored in Maine.''
   Tailors say some customers arrive with photographs or drawings of
suits they want, and the tailors readily work on their creations.
   ``David Bowie wanted a silk suit,'' said Sam's son. ``Robert
Wagner brought one (suit) for us to copy. Kissinger is a bit
conservative. He did not have any special requests.''
   With the popularity of Hong Kong's tailored suits, some stores
have opened branches overseas, while others regularly dispatch
representatives on trips to measure customers for clothes that are
then made and mailed to them.
   ``This allows them to have a Hong Kong suit without visiting Hong
Kong,'' explained one tailor.

   The good news about styles for the early 1990s is
that they seem to be aimed at women with minds of their own, rather
than at sheepish fashionplates to be herded into ridiculous garb to
look trendy.
   There's a vast choice in the offerings to send the 1980s out in
style. The clothes are hardly revolutionary, but the best are timely
and as freshly appealing as champagne.
   Designers are letting go of their recent visions of bouncy,
ruffly little girls in poufs, as well as slinky vamps.
   Finally, they're thinking of women who work, travel and like to
feel easy and pretty in whatever they choose. Whether the clothes
are based on masculine styles or are all dressed up for evening,
they are presented with an eye to both ease and elegance.
   Silhouettes and fabrics are softer in these new clothes, with a
light touch of body-consciousness in the structuring. Shoulders are
padded for shape but never dominate.
   Skirt lengths are barely relevant, though quite long and above
the knee are the younger-looking norms. Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel
dismisses any discussion of skirt lengths as being ``for old
crones.'' His answer to youth is to show some outfits without any
skirt at all _ simply tights under handsome jackets.
   Trousers are a welcome solution, though the wide A-line look has
been cut back to somewhat straighter lines _ on the dressy side in
suits _ with waist tucking, as at Saint Laurent and Jean-Louis
Scherrer.
   Jackets are starred everywhere. They range from very long styles,
flattering as they cover the derriere, to snug spencers, battle
jackets and boleros. Details may be strong in piping, zigzag
fastening, little belts or vents at the back.
   And several designers give fantasy touches with swallowtail or
cutaway styles in dressier models.
   Coats are another big story. If you like trench or belted
``bathrobe'' styles, you'll find handsome ones for fall.
   Italians designers like Tarlazzi and Romeo Gigli ``cocoon'' their
models in sumptuous coats. Tarlazzi's camel-colored wrap with a
bright lining is remarkable. Gigli's opulent Byzantine cocoons are
so colorful they seem to have already matured into butterflies.
   Christian Lacroix plays with the cape theme in loud color
combinations with his short suits or in more subdued styles to evoke
the England of Vita Sackville-West and the literary Bloomsbury set.
   Capes are glamorous at Saint Laurent and hot numbers at Patrick
Kelly, where little caped riding hoods are as fun as they are
colorful.
   As classic suits have come back into focus in the fashion
picture, so have soft dresses, looking better than ever as buttoned
coat dresses, shirtdresses and little shifts.
   Fabrics are important for these stylishly soft clothes, making
them more fluid and sensual than ever _ even the flecked caviar
tweeds. Large plaids, stripes and houndstooth checks offer new
choices at Christian Lacroix, Scherrer and elsewhere.
   Synthetics such as fake furs and wool or silk blends are looking
better than ever. And the new softer, lighter woolens are a boon to
travelers, who'd rather arrive not looking rumpled.
   Folk art is making a chic comeback with Lacroix's favorite
Provencal motifs or kilim rug designs, as well as the handsome black
and white Chanel knits borrowed from Indian weaves.
   Scherrer and Hanae Mori are keen on exotic animal prints and
weaves, and Scherrer's feather patterns add a light touch as well.
   Look for temptingly light jerseys, cashmeres, and knits in cables
and other textures this season, along with soft flannel and
broadcloth. The new tweed and serge don't scratch.
   The up-to-date gold, mustard, olive and forest green. Lavender
and deep purple or pink add a heathery touch to autumn wardrobes.
   But Paris isn't timid about color. The designers are prodigious
in their use of red _ everything from deep raspberry or garnet to
cardinal, orange-coral, fuchsia, fire engine or flame. These also
mix well with deep brown, purple or black.
   The evening scene means a transformation from workaday outfits to
splendidly feminine clothes for cocktails at the Ritz or dinner at
Maxim's. Black is still reliable for sexy little lace or velvet
numbers, and never before have silk ``grain de poudre'' tuxedo
outfits with pants or skirts looked so attractively varied or
feminine.
   But overall, we're seeing more late-day color, in decollete or
``bustier'' dresses with practical little jackets.
   Lame and brocade give dazzle to clothes for welcoming in 1990 _
especially the Japanese flower-print patterns at Hanae Mori, and the
Byzantine motifs at Lacroix, Gigli and elsewhere.
   Scene-stealing hats for these glamorous clothes are Lacroix's
``mad hatter'' chapeau, his big buccaneer hat, and large-brimmed
skimmers at Chanel. Turbans, berets and fur toques are also good
head warmers as well as fashionable.

   Britain's reputation as a fashion capital for
individualists has been reinforced with autumn collections that
offer everything from fringes, fake fur and animal prints to classic
wools and perennial velvets.
   The result is ``anything goes'' _ with no single direction for
British fashion.
   Skirts are long or short. Pants are narrow or very full. Jackets
are long and lean or short and swingy. The looks are ethnic, or
cowboy, or biker, or Russian, or prim Miss Marple English.
   ``I think anything goes this season,'' says David Sassoon of
Bellville Sassoon, who designs evening dresses for Princess Diana.
``But I think people have found it difficult to buy. I think they've
found too many kooky clothes and not enough that people will wear.''
   Marie Gavrielides of Warwick, R.I., whose company Kellouie's
sells to private clients, agrees, saying the British shows _ with a
few exceptions _ were ``too high fashion'' for the States.
   ``Paris is more classic,'' she says. ``Americans are way too
classic for most of these collections. Everything moves so much
faster in England. Designs are very up, very progressive.''
   The greatest excitement seems to be generated at the young end of
the fashion scene, with the accessory and clothing firm Pink Soda
setting the trend for the 15-25 generation.
   Its collection _ inspired by India, Morocco and Turkey _ features
lots of embroidery, animal prints, fringed scarves, corset-like
bustiers with lurex, coins, bells and pompons, and plenty of ethnic
necklaces. All are topped with fake fur or patterned velvet bowler
hats.
   ``We've had a lot of interest from the States _ more than in the
last five years,'' says David Solomon, head of the firm.
   Helen Storey's beaded chiffon bra tops, fringed zebra bolero and
one-piece leather chaps with attached boots also are big hits in the
young market.
   Some top British designers took the bizarre route during recent
London showings.
   Katharine Hamnett's biker-look collection, harking back to the
1970s, includes a skin-tight black velour jumpsuit worn with
high-cut black leather briefs and a leather bomber jacket with metal
studs bearing her latest ecology slogan _ ``Clean up or Die.''
   Rifat Ozbek, winner of the British Fashion Council's Designer of
the Year award, returned to his Turkish roots with belly-dancer bras
fringed with gold coins, leopard-print pants and Berber-striped
coats.
   At the other end of the fashion spectrum for autumn and winter
are the more traditional designers who have become part of Britain's
fashion establishment.
   Jean Muir features loose jumpsuits. Gina Fratini has black velvet
strapless ones molded to the body and covered with Indian
mirrored-cloth jackets. Caroline Charles reflects Miss Marple _
Agatha Christie's elderly sleuth who personifies British solidity _
with long, lean earth-colored tweeds, trimmed in fake fur. Ally
Capellino also does a prim English look with skirts down to the
ankle.
   Edina Ronay's collection includes animal prints, velvet suits
with gold beading, and colored Venetian silks, said ``the Americans
are coming back'' after several seasons in the wings.
   David Sassoon, whose midi-chiffons and short sequinned wool
jerseys were big sellers, also says sales to the United States are
up. ``The Americans want glamorous clothes that women will wear, and
they come here for evening wear _ no doubt about it.''
   But Betty Jackson, who did a softer, more feminine collection
with a new A-line silhouette based on Tibetan and Mongolian themes,
says ``the Americans have been difficult for a few seasons now.''
   ``I think they come as voyeurs.''

   Giorgio Armani's sporty Emporio line and
spoof specialist Franco Moschino's gag-filled wardrobe headline the
Italian ready-to-wear collections for fall and winter.
   Pants in all shapes and sizes prevail in both collections, with
only a scattering of skirts.
   Armani plays heavily on casual wear with the Emporio label, which
he created to reach a younger, more price-conscious clientele.
Featured are wool knit sweat pants worn under tweed blazers or
matching jackets. Other trousers are super wide and cropped at the
ankle, with or without cuffs.
   His new winter jackets are cut off above the waist. At times they
have long loose backs, at others they are trimmed in demure
pie-crust ruffles. His blazer is single breasted with huge breast
and side pockets, a look he introduced under his more exclusive
Armani label several seasons ago.
   There are plenty of beautiful coats _ from the classic polo to
cape coats and fun furs. Armani no longer uses real skins in his
designs and offers fake sable, mink and bear coats. To make his
point even stronger, he has dotted his leather wear _ from shoes to
purses _ with fake leopard spots.
   Evening at Emporio is very 1930-ish, with long clinging black
jersey velvet dresses, enhanced by small velvet hats complete with
feathers and feather-cuffed gloves. He also favors the tuxedo look
with silk lapels, studs and black ties.
   Armani has never used bright colors in his collections, and the
Emporio line is no exception. Browns, grays, blacks, and traditional
fall shades, only lightly spattered with bright red and green, make
up his favorite palette.
   Franco Moschino, on the other hand, is far less subdued, with a
reputation as a fashion jokester, including gags like tape measure
belts, dinner jackets decorated with real flatware, and an Irish
sweater with a ball of yarn and knitting needles still attached at
the collar.
   But behind Moschino's jokes is a very serious designer with lots
of superbly designed clothes.
   For fall and winter Moschino prefers pants with wide bell bottoms
and long jackets with large cloth buttons.
   Like Armani, he prefers to let animals keep their skins, choosing
opulent fuzzy coats and stoles in harmless synthetic fabric.

   They always fit, they last for years, they endure through
transient fashion changes _ and they are among the biggest sellers
of this season's fashion scene.
   They are accessories _ scarves, handbags, jewelry, anything to
decorate and accent clothing. Accessories magazine estimates that
the customers bought about $14 billion worth of these last year.
   Some prestigious names are making a showing in new parts of this
lucrative market _ like Tiffany and Cartier, New York Fifth Avenue
jewellers who both are marketing scarves, handbags and other small
leather goods.
   Tiffany's entry into scarves began with a few designs made up for
the store's 150th anniversary two years ago. Sales _ at $150 each _
were so rewarding that the store now currently stocks about 200
designs at its outlets around the country and overseas. Exotic
florals and chinoiserie, bordered with logo designs, dominate the
all-silk collection.
   ``Jewelry is the ultimate accessory, and we see our scarves as an
extension of our jewelry,'' says Tiffany's design director John
Loring. ``The scarves are already having a very nice career for
themselves.''
   Tiffany handbags are dressy and classic in silk and leather, all
with signature details _ including one with a large ``T'' closure.
   Cartier's scarves include some imprinted with graphics of
precious jewelry, signed with store's boutique logo, Must de
Cartier. They blend with a line of silk evening bags with similar
designs.
   Cartier says that one of its more popular categories is watches _
wardrobes of them, including their Pasha watches. Men, especially,
are conscious of watches as fashion accessories. Cartier offers them
with straps in vivid primary colors, like bottle green, to black
crocodile and gold. ``Watches are one item of jewelry which men can
use to make a distinctive statement both about their individual
personalities and their success without stepping out of bounds of
proper male etiquette,'' says Jill Romeo King, boutique manager at
Cartier's New York store.
   If jewelry is the ultimate accessory, it's still not necessary to
lay out a lot of money for ``good'' pieces, like natural stones and
precious metals. The American Gem Society reports that colored
gemstones are enjoying a current surge in popularity. Rarity and
price range widely, but most are affordable for most people. Some of
the most common and popular gems include peridot (bright green),
rubellite tourmaline (hot pink), aquamarine (pale blue), kunzite
(pale pink), citrine (honey tones), and amethyst (purple).
   William G. Underwood, president of the society, says interest in
the stones began building in the early 1980s, when British Princess
Diana chose a sapphire and diamond engagement ring. An AGS survey
also revealed strong preference for pearls.
   These pieces increase in both sentimental and actual value,
Underwood says, and they never go out of style. ``Many of the
popular jewelry designs today came from the 40s and 50s when pearls
and pins were staple items in a woman's jewelry wardrobe.''
   New York jewelry designer Denise Solay adds: ``Jewelry is
seasonless and timeless and allows a woman to make a personal
statement on her own terms.'' She markets her designs, strongly
influenced by her world travels, through her own company, A World on
a String.

   Jewelry designer Denise Solay offers these tips to get the most
positive effect from your jewelry.
   _ Wear what you like and like what you wear. Your choices express
your personality.
   _ Don't follow the pack. Stay with the things you like, whether
it's a sleek modern piece or an ancient Ethiopian amulet. ``Define
your style and stick to it,'' Solay says.
   _ Wear what looks well on you. Assess your physical features and
your preferences. For example, chokers look well on long necks and
drop earrings lengthen the wide face.
   _ Mix and match. A $1 plastic ring may look great with a $5,000
enameled Kabyle cuff from Algeria.
   _ Don't be timid. ``People dress to be noticed. Bold jewelry does
it faster,'' she says. She recommends a large centerpiece on a
necklace to add verve and excitement _ a 2-inch ball of amber, a
gold-trimmed cameo, or an old silver Touareg amulet mixed with beads
of Nigerian sand coral and silver. Be bold even with small pieces.
Pile on three or four of your more delicate chains and bracelets.
   _ Build a wardrobe. Buy a few pieces at a time, fitting your
current needs. Identify a designer whose line you like and build
from there.
   _ Buy quality. It lasts, and it never goes out of style.
   Solay heads her own jewelry firm, A World on a String, and is a
member of the American Woman's Economic Development Corporation, a
nonprofit organization that trains and counsels women entrepreneurs.

   Sportswear makes up a big portion of the American wardrobe,
whether the wearers are really dedicated to fitness and sports or
just experiencing them vicariously by adapting the styles to street
and casual wear.
   The National Sporting Goods Association says that Americans last
year spent about $1.6 billion on sweatshirts and pants; $752 million
on walking shoes; $461 million on warmup suits; $460 million on
running shoes; $327 million on aerobic shoes; and $88 million on
leotards and bodysuits.
   Those serious about their activities are finding new fabrics and
gear that will make them more comfortable in their pursuits. The
rest of the sportswear customers can simply enjoy the sports cachet
in bold, bright and comfortable clothes.
   ``Active wear has become any-wear,'' says Randy Ronning, J.C.
Penney's men's fashion director. ``Ski-inspired jackets that may
never see a slope come in great colors and color blocks in the same
fabrics and with stitch detailing like the real thing.''
   But those really heading for the slopes, the hunting grounds or
the running tracks can test new fabrics for insulation,
sweat-wicking, and water protection. Some of these are based on Du
Pont's High Trek, a combination of Orlon, wool and a hollow-core
fiber called Hollofil being used in sweaters, socks, hats, scarves
and thermal underwear. Du Pont says the yarns evaporate perspiration
more efficiently, are fluffier, warmer and less itchy than natural
fabrics.
   The company also markets Coolmax, Supplex, Lycra and Microfine _
lighter-weight elastic and nylon-based blends that offer various
degrees of wicking, wind and water protection, flexibility and
comfort in clothes for biking, swimming, and similar activities.
   For some, especially customers in the teen and young adult
market, the main attractions are trendiness and flash. These are
found in skin-tight bikers' pants, leotards in prints and jacquard
textures, and the ubiquitous T-shirts with big graphic abstract
prints, most in primary or neon colors. A line of leotards and tops
with the imprimatur of ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov is typical of
the clothes that blur the line between athletic function and fashion.
   Others can find clothing with team logos from across the sports
spectrum. Penney's has a new line of sportswear tied in with the
1992 Olympics, featuring sportswear screened with USA Olympic
logotypes.

   Socks may seem a trivial part of your sportswear wardrobe, until
you've rubbed up painful blisters or grown a crop of athlete's foot
fungus to put you out of action.
   ``Unrelieved foot perspiration can lead to blisters and fungus
infection,'' as well as very unpleasant odor,'' says Dr. Marc
Brenner, a podiatrist specializing in sports medicine.
   Simply stated, blisters happen when your feet sweat and the sweat
has nowhere to go. Natural fibers that absorb perspiration but don't
move it away from your skin leave your feet moist, soft, and
vulnerable to the friction you naturally get from walking or
running. And since the insides of your shoes also will be warm and
airless, you'll be a walking culture medium for fungus.
   Several manufacturers of sports socks are using an updated
version of an old standby, Orlon, to counter these problems. The
makers _ ThorLo, Burlington, SAI and Ridgeview _ worked with DuPont
in developing Ultratech Orlon, a fiber that they say wicks moisture
away from the wearer at least three times faster than cotton.

   Backpacks@bookbags and blue jeans _ along with stereos _ are
considered the most essential items of campus life at America's
colleges, according to a nationwide personal interview survey.
   Other popular clothing items among Americans include T-shirts,
black colored clothing, leather jackets or coats (other than bombr
or motorcycle jackets) and mini-skirts.
   The study, conducted for Levi Strauss by the Roper Organization,
consisted of personal interviews with more than 1,000 students on 10
U.S. campuses.
   In addition, for the first time since the annual poll was first
conducted in 1985, some 400 students in four foreign universities
were included in the survey. The foreign schools were La Sorbonne,
Paris, France; Cattolica University, Milan, Italy; Keio University,
Tokyo, Japan, and the University of Toronto in Canada.
   Considered fashion ``outs'' on both the domestic (83 percent) and
foreign (84 percent) campus scene are sixties-style looks, such as
bell bottoms, peace signs and smiley faces. Neon colored clothing
was voted ``out'' by 71 percent of U.S. students and 87 percent of
foreign students polled.
   More than half of U.S. students (57 percent) feel that athletic
shoes (other than high tops) are essential wardrobe accessories, and
nearly half (47 percent) also mentioned leather belts and pierced
earrings (45 percent).
   Foreign students polled preferred leather belts (35 percent),
rings (28 percent) and penny loafers (25 percent) when accessorizing
their outfits.
   American students said they prefer their jeans loose (58
percent), while the foreign choice is for a tighter fit (49 percent).
   And when it comes to choosing the world's most fashionable city,
Paris was the choice of 40 percent of the Americans, with New York
the runner-up (25 percent), followed by Milan (12 percent), Los
Angeles (11 percent), London (6 percent), Tokyo (2 percent) and
Toronto (1 percent).
   Among the foreign students, Paris (35 percent) was followed by
Milan (24 percent), New York (14 percent), London (12 percent), Los
Angeles (6 percent), Tokyo (3 percent) and Toronto (2 percent).

   Because today's expectant mothers continue to work through most
of their pregnancies, they choose more fashionable maternity clothes
and plan to continue wearing them after delivery, says a maternity
wear designer.
   Judy Loeb, design director for the Trio line from Jeanette
Maternities Inc., says women aren't borrowing these clothes as much
as they did in the past because new designs are more appropriate to
the workplace. Loeb, who designed the popular rhinestone-decorated
``Baby'' T-shirt several years ago, says these pointers should be
kept in mind when shopping for the new styles:
   _ Oversized regular clothes won't fit properly because they
aren't designed to compensate for a larger stomach and are likely to
hike up.
   _ Choose your regular size in maternity lines.
   _ Don't buy too much for one occasion. Balance the wardrobe
between business and weekend wear
   _ Try support pantyhose to reduce leg discomfort during pregnancy.
   _ A maternity slip or petticoat will make clothes drape better
and give you a smoother silhouette.
   _ Tops should be long enough to cover your stomach, derriere and
hips.
   _ Natural fibers such as cotton, wool and some rayons will be
most comfortable.
   _ Don't buy everything at once. Space your purchases carefully,
buying special occasion clothes when and if you need them. Allow for
impulse shopping late in your pregnancy.

   Not to be left out in the current Batman movie hype, J.C. Penney
has a complete wardrobe and accessories collection for young
Batmaniacs.
   According to Peter McGrath, a Penney's merchandise manager, the
store's Batwear departments can outfit its customers with insignia
clothes from head to toe and throw in a logo beach towel, too.
T-shirts, sneakers, and shorts head the collection.
   ``I don't think we`ve seen anything yet,'' says McGrath, who
thinks the appetite for Batman merchandise is part of the 1960s pop
culture revival. --_

she still managed to get to a shopping mall on a stretcher to follow
her passion for fashion.
   ``I was the only person shopping for clothes from a horizontal
position,'' recalls the vivacious brunette, who graduated from
California's Brooks College with a degree in fashion merchandising
and design.
   A physical therapy counselor encouraged Pamela to become a
computer programmer or a keypunch operator but that was much too
uncreative, she says, adding:
   ``I told them I was going to Hollywood to study acting. They
laughed.''
   But now, more than a decade after her stroke, the 35-year-old Ms.
Martin's determination has paid off with wheelchair appearances in
several television dramas, feature films and national talk shows.
She also writes a column, ``Rolling With Laughter,'' and recently
created the cartoon feature ``Wheelies.''
   Her modeling gigs have been mainly in behalf of Everest &amp;
Jennings, a California-based firm that produces ``Avenues,'' a
catalog line of fashionable clothing with hidden features to speed
dressing for wheelchair users.
   ``People who are disabled deserve to have a positive fashion
image,'' says Pamela, whose modeling endeavors began at the age of
6. ``I did fashion shows for charity and social events throughout my
schoolgirl and college days.
   ``Now the biggest difference between my ability and disability is
that I model on wheels instead of in heels.
   ``Most people just jump in their clothes and _ zip _ they're off,
but for me, getting dressed can be a major project.''
   Often, she points out, conventional clothing doesn't fit or look
attractive on people who spend their day sitting. Jackets are too
long and too binding when propelling a sheelchair. Slacks are too
short and pockets are out of reach. Skirts drag and get caught in
wheels.
   Designers of clothes for wheelchair users should develop patterns
which flatter the seated figure, according to clothing consultants.
   ``To create clothing for special needs, you must use design to
solve problems,'' explains Dr. Naomi Reich, chairman of the
University of Arizona's Clothing and Textiles Department. ``That
requires analysis.''
   Research and testing indicate that such clothing should be cut
with extra fabric in the seat and less in the front.
   Other touches can include thigh pockets or hidden calf pockets
for keeping glasses, keys and other items within easy reach. And
some pants can have hidden ankle-to-knee zippers to speed dressing
and accommodate braces.
   According to Gret Atkins of Cornell University's Department of
Textiles and Apparel, clothing can be as much a barrier to
wheelchair users as a curb without a curb cut.
   ``Sometimes dressing can be so exhausting that they might choose
to stay in their nightwear and not go out or invite someone over,''
she says. ``We're such a visual society that most disabling
conditions _ whether an artificial limb, uneven gait or wheelchair _
call attention to themselves.
   ``If clothing draws further attention to disabilities then we
have failed as designers.''

   Computerization in the garment industry has
given new meaning to the term software _ make that softwear _ and
apparel design students at Cornell University are now learning to
design and cut patterns on machines similar to the ones they will be
using as professionals.
   A computer program normally used by architects and engineers,
AutoCAD, has been adapted to work with the soft lines and design
requirements of clothing. This microcomputer _ more affordable than
the huge computer systems in large apparel firms _ enables students
to carry out the entire garment design process, from preliminary
sketches to pattern layouts, or markers.
   Traditional paper pattern making requires slow, meticulous
cutting and taping. Lisa Gedzelman, a senior apparel design student
from Chappaqua, N.Y., says the computer eases this job. ``Revisions
to my skirt and short-sleeve jacket outfit that would normally call
for recutting the pattern by hand were quick and easy on the
computer.''
   The computers were installed in l988 with a grant from Project
Ezra, an $8 million IBM program providing computers for use by
Cornell.
   ``Probably eight to 10 schools are making their first use of
AutoCAD in apparel design courses, but Cornell may be the only one
that is taking the designs to the garment stage,'' says Anita
Racine, senior lecturer in the textiles and apparel department, who
teaches the class in computer-aided design.

   If it's not as comfortable as an old shoe, don't buy the new one.
   So says Geof Bloom, whose company makes Hush Puppies footwear.
``When you're shopping for fall shoes, remember any shoe that
doesn't fit properly will cause some degree of pain,'' he says.
   He offers these tips for shoe shoppers:
   _ Shop for shoes in mid-afternoon, when your feet have swollen to
their normal maximum.
   _ Wear appropriate hosiery or socks, the same type you plan to
wear with the shoes.
   _ Postpone shopping if your feet hurt. You won't be able to tell
if it's the new pair that is uncomfortable.
   _ Try on both shoes. The left foot usually is larger than the
right.
   _ Try shoes by fit, not size. Different styles may fit
differently. If in doubt, try the next size up; the shoe may be only
a sixth of an inch longer, but that small margin can prove to be
what makes it wearable.
   _ Be aware of the difference between ``snug'' and ``tight.'' A
snug shoe may stretch a bit and mold to the foot in use. But don't
expect to break in a shoe that pinches or cramps.
   _ Stand up on your full weight and see if you can wiggle your
toes. There should be at least a half-inch space in front of your
longest toe.
   _ Make sure the widest part of your foot sits in the widest part
of the shoe. This will let the shoe and foot bend together.
   _ Walk as hard and fast as you do normally when trying on shoes.
Make several circuits around the shop or department.
   _ Test the shoes at home after you've purchased them. Walk around
the house on hard floors for at least five minutes to judge if the
shoes feel as comfortable as they did on the store's soft carpeting.
If they don't, remember that as long as you haven't worn the shoes
outdoors, you can return them to the store for a better fit.

   The colors of the desert _ from golden sand to vibrant purple _
inspire the latest shades on the cosmetic palette, according to an
article in Harper's Bazaar.
   For lips, blushers and eye shadows, the magazine says, reds and
pastels are giving way to tan, beige, brown, sage green, brick,
burnt orange, turquoise, periwinkle and violet.
   There are many gradations in desert colors _ ``pale and serene to
gutsy and sultry,'' says the magazine.
   ``They evoke wonderful emotions, feelings of friendliness and
warmth from the earthy shades, and playfulness from the brights,''
says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color
Institute.
   She says ``people are traveling a lot more these days; they're
discovering America,'' particularly the Southwest.
   ``Visit the area and you're mesmerized by the terrain, the clear
blue sky, the incredible sunsets. These colors linger indelibly in
your mind and in the striking image you'd like to project,'' she
says.
   In general, makeup professionals agree that when lips are strong,
eyes should be less than vibrant, and vice-versa, she says. Cheek
color should always be minimal and well blended.
   For blondes, lips should be translucent beige by day and rich
brown at night, highlighted with transparent gold.
   Cheeks should be pale burnt umber by day, and light brick at
night.
   Eyes by day should be dusty sage green, while at night they
should be deep brown with a hint of gold highlight in the center of
the lid.
   For brunettes, lips by day should be semitranslucent orange-red,
worn well-blotted, switching at night to intense orange-red with
matte finish.
   Cheeks by day vary from palomino for pale skin and peach-orange
for tan. At night, switch to terra cotta, highlighted with gold on
the cheekbones.
   Brunette eyes should be russet on the lips by day, and at night
turquoise at the outer corner and yellow at the inner.
   Redheads should color their lips with very transparent
peach-orange by day, and terra cotta with a gold highlight at night.
   Cheeks should be peach-orange in the daytime and terra cotta at
night.
   Eyes by day should present sage green lids with lavender at the
outer corners in the daytime, changing by night to sage with
turquoise at the outer corner and lavender at the inner corner.
   The black color scheme calls for lips that are sand color by day
and intense orange-red mixed with mahogany at night.
   Cheeks should go from orange-brick by day to terra cotta at night.

   If your past experience with permanent waving left you with a
wild and woolly cap and a feeling that your hair would crumble if
you put a comb to it, you might try one of the new perms that offer
less drastic results _ or non-permanent permanents.
   A line of home permanents, Epic Waves, depends on a milder
chemical formula that gives the user the options to ``try on'' a
perm temporarily, better control, and the ability to re-perm often.
   Developed by Gillette, the line is formulated with a
protein-building amino acid, cysteine, which, with ammonium
bisulfites, only partially restructures hair. Regular permanents use
chemicals that completely break down the molecular structure of hair
and rebuild it again.
   ``Our consumer research shows that the three biggest fears women
have about home perming are lack of control, long-term commitment,
and damage to hair by frequent perming,'' says Mary Ann Pesce,
marketing director for Gillete's hair care products.
   The company says its Try-on Perm is the first temporary home
permanent product. Aimed at the first-time user, it fades away
within two weeks, leaving hair with slightly more body. Adaptable
Perm lets the user control the level of curl. She can wait up to two
days for the curl to relax before locking in it with a finishing
rinse, or, if she still isn't satisfied, she can skip the finishing
rinse and let the hair return to its original form. Anytime Perm can
be used without damage up to nine times a year for those who like
frequent re-perming. Other processes, like coloring, can be used the
same day as the permanents.

   Hairstyles this fall will be softer and more natural looking,
says the man who calls himself Xenon, the international creative
director for the Helene Curtis Professional Division.
   ``Women are realizing that subtlety can be sexy,'' he says, and
are returning to the ``simple, elegant styling of the '30s and '40s.
This season's `hottest' looks will definitely be more `styled' than
before.''
   Hair will be worn shoulder length or longer _ or quite short _
with few variations in between, he says.
   He envisions longer hairstyles worn gently waved and full on the
sides by day, pulled back into sleek french twists for evening;
shorter hair will be smaller and less ``spiky'' than before,
following the shape of the head in a cap-like fashion.
   Bangs will remain an element for styles of all lengths, he says,
worn fuller, longer and brushed down instead of up.

   Go vest, young man, is the styling advice coming this fall from
some men's fashion designers, who note that even President Bush
wears a brocade vest with his tuxedo on some occasions.
   ``Vests are a strong item in all kinds of fabrications and
stylings and with details like leather buttons,'' says Randy
Ronning, men's fashion director at J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ``We expect
vests to be 25 percent of our sweater business.''
   Ronning feels the return of the vest as a way to invigorate the
wardrobe is part of a trend toward a more relaxed sophistication in
menswear favored by both European and American designers.
   Some fashion experts describe it as a new direction of easy
elegance, meaning a more casual approach to tailored clothing and a
dressier angle on sportswear.
   This could add up to the relaxed look of a knit sweater vest worn
with a business suit or the dressy flair of a fancy brocade vest
coupled with a sports jacket and casual pants, or a colorful
cardigan vest with jeans and a sports shirt.
   Designer Henry Grethel, for whom sweater dressing has become a
signature, offers a fall sportswear collection that features the
solid or patterned cardigan vest.
   ``Under a sportcoat or over a woven shirt, the cardigan vest
boasts an air of gentility,'' suggests a Grethel publicist. ``The
button shawl collar makes a comeback, and the classic, cable-design
mock turtleneck sweater is ever present.''
   Liz Claiborne, another designer, noting a trend of pattern mixing
with colliding colors, has a weekender collection described as
rugged and relaxed, with an emphasis on tops, outerwear and American
Indian motifs. A key item is the oiled cowhide jacket, ``cut sleek
and sporty.''
   As often happens when it comes to fashions, however, there is not
complete unanimity among the experts.
   Concerning vested interest, for example, Playboy magazine's
fashion consultant said recently three-piece suits (the ones with
vests) ``have definitely gone out of style....Unless the fall season
brings a resurgence of this style, you should retire your vests and
stick to wearing the two other pieces of your suit.''

   Women in weight control programs should pay just as much
attention to their appearance as their ideal-weight sisters, says
the fashion editor of Weight Watchers Magazine.
   ``It's important for a woman to have stylish, good-looking
clothes while she's in the transition phases,'' says Lisa Goldstein,
whose magazine targets women who are trying to improve their
appearance through weight control.
   Goldstein says that the notion that larger women shouldn't wear
patterned clothing is unfair. ``One of our September fashion pages
features a woman wearing a cardigan in a bold argyle pattern, and it
looks exactly right.''
   Well-chosen accessories also will help the overweight women feel
and look better. ``A well-placed bracelet or necklace helps
accentuate a woman's best features, like pretty hands or eyes.''

   Among unusual fashion ideas is the possibility of changing eye
color with tinted contact lenses.
   ``Think of the possibilities,'' says a representative of the
American Optometric Association. ``You can change the color of your
eyes to match the outfit you are wearing as easily as you can change
your bag or shoes.
   ``Most optometrists prescribe lenses tinted by the manufacturer,
but some may do the tinting themselves in their offices.''
   Consumers have a choice of soft lenses, soft extended-wear lenses
or rigid gas-permeable lenses in a variety of tints, according to
Dr. James Boucher of Laramie, Wyo., chairman of the association's
Contact Lens Section.
   That poses a problem for some wearers, he cautions, explaining:
   ``Sometimes the lens that will not compromise your eye health and
will give you the best vision and most comfortable fit doesn't come
in a tint.
   ``In those cases, I recommend going with a clear lens. Having the
best vision possible and good eye health is what matters most.''

<HEAD>New Program Returns Equity to Older Homeowners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Margaret Gregory was dipping into her savings so deeply she was
afraid she'd be forced to sell her condominium and move into an
apartment.
   ``I'm 84 years old ... come August and I was using up my savings
because I didn't think I was going to live so long, and then I
didn't realize what I was going to live on,'' said Mrs. Gregory, a
retired social worker.
   Her solution was a reverse mortgage on her San Diego condominium,
the opposite of a standard home mortgage. Instead of building equity
as she pays the bank each month, the company pays her each month as
her equity drops.
   The financial tool is available from three companies, a handful
of states have offered publicly funded or backed programs, and the
Federal Housing Administration this month is launching a pilot
program with 2,500 insured reverse mortgages available nationally.
   ``One way to think about this is there are nearly 19 million
elderly households in the country. Eighty-three percent of them own
their own home and 73 percent of the owners own their homes free and
clear.'' said Judith May, the chief architect of the FHA program.
``Yet at the same time, 1.7 million elderly owners have houses worth
more than $50,000 and annual income below $10,000.
   ``In other words, they could be described as house rich and cash
poor, and they could be candidates for reverse mortgages.''
   To encourage a test of the offerings, the FHA program, set to
begin July 24, allows selected lenders almost every option ever
thought up.
   Borrowers 62 and older can choose from a lifetime reverse
mortgage, one that lasts a specific number of years, one that offers
a line of credit or a combination. Interest can be either fixed or
adjustable. Homeowners can pledge 100 percent of their equity or any
portion. Appreciation in home values can be factored in. No matter
which options are selected, homeowners can stay at home until they
move, sell or die. At that point the lender gets the full amount of
equity that was pledged, even if it wasn't all used.
   Mrs. Gregory, long divorced and with no children, had maintained
a private practice in psychotherapy until last year. She had been
living on her Social Security and was spending her savings.
   The reverse mortgage on her $135,000 condo is with the
Providential Home Income Plan based in San Francisco. She pledged 60
percent of equity and gets about $500 a month as long as she lives
to help meet a $1,300 monthly budget. Providential will be repaid
the full 60 percent when she dies.
   ``It's a lifetime program, so the longer you live the more
benefit you get from it. If I should die in the next day or two,
they would get the benefit of my estate, but if I can live six years
or more I will get the benefit.''
   Her 78-year-old sister in nearby Carlsbad now is getting one
herself.
   ``It's very good. It really solves my problems,'' Mrs. Gregory
said. ``In a year or two, I'd probably have to sell the house and
find some other living arrangement that would be cheaper. I didn't
want to move.''
   The same thoughts were expressed by some of the 3,500 older
Americans who have opted for reverse mortgages.
   ``The typical borrower has been about 75 years of age, about
two-thirds single women living alone, 25 percent elderly couples.
Their average income has been below $10,000 for women and below
$14,000 for couples,'' Ms. May said. She believes the FHA offers the
best deal for those with homes worth $150,000 or less. Higher values
would bring higher benefits from private plans.
   The maximum payout on FHA loans is tied to age, interest, and the
form and amount of the loan. A 75-year-old widow with a $100,000
debt-free house would qualify for $812 a month on a five-year
fixed-term reverse mortgage at 10 percent interest with no
appreciation-sharing.
   Florida is about to kick off a program, but outsiders are
critical. It only offers term mortgages, people must be 70 or older
to apply, payments go down if interest rates go up, and lenders will
be allowed to claim contents from an estate other than the house if
payments exceed equity.
   Lenders and experts familiar with the program have been critical,
and administrator Rodney Roberts said the sponsor is re-examining
the 70-year age limit. ``There will be improvements to this program.
There will be improvements to all of the others.''
   Other state programs operate in Connecticut and Rhode Island. In
Virginia, the program was so popular the fund was exhausted;
Maryland is launching one, and Pennsylvania and North Carolina are
developing programs.
   American Homestead Mortgage Corp. of Mount Laurel, N.J., the
largest private lender, has written more than 2,500 reverse
mortgages since 1983 and now operates in eight states and the
District of Columbia.
   Capital Holding Corp., of Louisville, Ky., introduced its product
in October, and Providential wrote its first loan in November.
   ``Seniors are a little cautious about doing something this big,
and it is a big deal,'' said Capital Holding spokeswoman Tricia
Snoke. ``We encourage them to talk to financial advisers, talk to
their children, talk to their banker.''
   ``Would you call it the wave of the future? No, maybe a ripple.
The likelihood is it's going to remain fairly small,'' said Ken
Scholen, director of the National Center of Home Equity Conversion
in Madison, Wis., and generally recognized as the grandfather of
reverse mortgages.
   ``A year ago, we were looking at maybe a dozen states. A year
from now, it'll be probably 33 states. In five years, all 50
states.''

<NOTE>TYPES OF MORTGAGES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _``Tenure'' or lifetime mortgages guarantee homeowners monthly
checks for as long as they live or occupy the house as a principal
residence.
   _``Term'' loans offer monthly checks for a specific number of
years.
   _``Line-of-credit'' loans let borrowers draw payments of any size
or frequency up to some maximum amount.
   _``Shared appreciation'' mortgages share property value increases
with the lender, and are offered in combination with term and
lifetime mortgages, generally resulting in a lower interest rate.

<NOTE>THINGS TO CONSIDER:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Tests can include application fees, closing costs, interest,
sales commissions and future appreciation.
   _Eligibility generally begins at age 62, and homeowners must be
free from mortgage debt or have only a small balance.
   _Interest generally ranging from 8 percent to 12.1 percent, and
mortgages can be fixed-rate or adjustable.

   Like the storybook awakening of Rip Van Winkle, who
found he'd slept into old age, Western European nations are
discovering what it means to lose their youth.
   Parts of Europe already have the world's highest populations of
elderly people, and governments are recognizing the change,
especially in the faster-aging north, where retirees may comprise 40
percent of some populations by 2040. From West Germany to Greece,
countries are studying how fewer young people will support strained
pension and health care systems.
   But gloomy visions of crowded old-age homes and broken economies
are out of line, experts say. They worry about the poor and lonely,
but say most will be comfortable, with money to spend _ as
advertisers have already noticed.
   The challenge, experts say, will be to show society that age
doesn't mean illness or empty lives. No American-style Gray Panthers
have appeared to defend the cause, but a British seniors group is
fighting age discrimination.
   ``Europe is in the position to be the first to enter a new social
world, so what we decide to do is of great importance. Only now is
anybody taking any notice of it,'' says Peter Laslett, a Cambridge
University demographer and expert on aging.
   ``We can't look at it simply in terms of a burden,'' says
Laslett, 73, who likes to lace demographic data with lines from
Wordsworth on the joys of youth. ``It's an enormous challenge for
human beings for the first time to use their whole potential.''
   Demographers say that while the developing world will catch up
quickly, Europe has more than twice the global proportion of
elderly, or 12.4 percent, and northern Europe has 2.5 times the
world average. Southern Europe, with its higher birthrates, is aging
less rapidly. By the year 2000 every fourth person will be over 65
in Western Europe, by one estimate.
   The main reasons are life-enhancing medicine and falling
birthrates, and some say Europe has been slow to recognize the
magnitude of the change.
   ``We're waking up to it late in the day,'' says Sally Greengross,
secretary-general of Eurolink Age, a coalition promoting the cause
of the 60 million over-60s in the European Economic Community.
   France forbids forced retirement and job advertisements aren't
allowed to set age limits. But other nations, says Eurolink Age,
have yet to follow suit.
   The 12-nation EEC plans a ``Year of the Elderly,'' but red tape
has postponed it to 1991. The EEC budget for elderly affairs more
than doubled in 1988, but only to the equivalent of $738,000.
   Pensions are of primary concern, prompted by fears of future
workers paying hefty proportions of their salaries to support
pensioners.
   West Germany estimates 40 percent of its population will be over
65 by 2040, and its Employers Federation says employees would have
to pay 36 percent of their salaries, or double today's rate, to
sustain benefits.
   The West German cabinet has proposed reforms, including hiking
the retirement age for women from 60 to 65, the age at which men
retire. Italy is considering similar action. Most EEC citizens can
receive retirement benefits at 60 or 65. Danes work the latest, to
67, and Italian women leave at 55.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has acted
to abolish a $130 weekly limit on what pensioners can earn before
losing some benefits. At the same time, it has been criticized for
cutting pensions as part of what the government calls ``weaning
Britons off the dependency culture.''
   The elderly increasingly contribute to the economy by filling in
for the shrinking numbers of the young. Already, some are being
wooed back by employers like Britain's Tesco supermarket chain,
which hires 55- to 69-year-olds.
   ``They're very reliable, conscientious, and don't need so much
training,'' says Barry Ball, the personnel manager who began Tesco's
scheme a year ago.
   ``I'm not ready for retirement _ work keeps me young,'' says
Doris Broderick, 58, who started working in a Tesco market coffee
shop six months ago after being laid off from serving coffee to
Lloyd's shipping staff.
   Success After Sixty, a British employment agency for over-50s,
reported a 60-percent jump in requests from companies in the first
two months of 1989 compared with the same period last year.
   But prejudice still keeps many from working, says the Association
of Retired Persons, a British group based on the American
Association of Retired Persons. ARP, which has signed up 25,000
members in eight months, hopes to expand to France and Germany.
   ``The elderly are just beginning to organize in France,'' said
Ariane Revol-Briard of France's 8-year-old Ministry for the Elderly.
In Germany, a politician recently suggested a political party for
those 60 and over.
   Southern European countries, on the other hand, have less use for
older workers. Spain, with 19 percent unemployment, is studying a
plan to offer tax breaks to companies which retire older workers
early.
   In the health field, Europeans are turning to home care to reduce
strain on care systems and promote independence, says Anthea Tinker,
head of Britain's Age Concern Institute of Gerontology and a
specialist on elderly housing.

   After writing 70 books _ 31 of them
best-selling mysteries _ Phyllis A. Whitney scoffs at any suggestion
of quitting.
   ``Horrible! What could be more boring,'' said the 85-year-old
Grand Master of American mystery writers. ``I've slowed down in that
I only write one book a year. A writer is what I am.''
   Her most recent book, ``Rainbow in the Mist,'' was published in
April, its title inspired by rainbows that tower over the
mist-shrouded Ragged Mountains after thunderstorms have washed the
sky around the mountaintop home Miss Whitney built two years ago.
   Not one to rest on her laurels, Miss Whitney is putting the
finishing touches on her 71st book, ``The Singing Stones,'' and
researching No. 72. ``I don't stop between books. You have to start
on new ideas immediately. To have a new story start burgeoning in
your imagination _ that's what's exciting.''
   Miss Whitney, who last year received the Mystery Writers of
America's highest honor, began writing at age 12. ``I was going to a
missionary school in China, and the English teacher there encouraged
me. It went to my head and I've been writing ever since.''
   Born in Japan to American parents who later lived in the
Philippines and China, Miss Whitney saw the United States for the
first time at age 15, after her father died and her mother returned
home. Her mother died three years later and the teen-ager moved in
with an aunt in Chicago.
   ``I did everything. I worked in bookstores and libraries, read
manuscripts and lectured,'' she said of her ongoing attraction to
writing.
   She eventually landed a job as children's book editor for the
Chicago Sun and later had a similar job with The Philadelphia
Inquirer, all the while writing hundreds of short stories, many of
which did not sell.
   Her first hardcover success came in 1941 with ``A Place for
Ann,'' a book for teen-agers. Miss Whitney wrote three dozen novels,
including 20 mysteries, for young people before settling in as a
writer of adult mysteries with the publication of ``The Quicksilver
Pool'' in 1955.
   Among the international best-sellers that followed were ``Feather
on the Moon,'' ``Silversword,'' ``Flaming Tree,'' ``Dream of
Orchids,'' ``Rainsong'' and ``Emerald.'' More than 50 million copies
of her books are available in the United States and 18 foreign
countries, according to her publisher, Doubleday, and all of her
adult novels are still in print.
   Some critics have classified Miss Whitney's work as romantic
suspense, but she rejects that label. ``It's mystery suspense _ a
Whitney kind of book.''
   Indeed, ``Rainbow in the Mist,'' about a clairvoyant who helps
solve one woman's murder and another's disappearance, has only a
whisper of romance.
   The protagonist in ``Rainbow,'' as in all Miss Whitney's books,
is a woman. ``That's the point of view I have. I feel more
comfortable with it.''
   Miss Whitney herself ``was way ahead of talk of women's
liberation. I've always been a liberated woman. I kept my own name''
through two marriages.
   Miss Whitney maintains a rigid, six-day work schedule. ``I get to
my desk by 9 and work until noon.'' The creative process begins
before she sits down at the typewriter _ she shuns a word processor
because ``I couldn't think with all those mechanical things to do.''
   After lunch, she exercises with a brisk walk on the deck that
surrounds her home, then takes a nap. She's back at work at 2 p.m.
and calls it a day at 5.
   Her time away from research and writing is as carefully scheduled
as her work days. Her recreation consists of dinner out and a movie
on Saturday nights with her daughter and son-in-law, who live
nearby, and watching ``Murder, She Wrote'' on television on Sunday
nights. ``I don't have much social life. I like people, but they can
be distracting. Writers have to be disciplined.''
   Her books have been so successful because ``I tell a good story.
I offer optimism. All my books have happy endings. I don't see any
point in letting my readers down at the end. I'm an optimist _
people feel that in my books.''
   Miss Whitney seems to radiate that quality, her youthful spirit
and zest for life belying her age.
   ``I'm not old,'' she said. ``I don't have time to die.''

   Most people, when planning for their future or for an unforeseen
illness, think only of ensuring that their financial affairs are in
order. It is equally important to protect the right to make
health-care decisions.
   Competent adults may consent to or refuse any medical treatment
that is proposed. But suppose they lack the capacity or are no
longer able to make a determination about the treatment. Who would
make that decision? In some cases, doctors would turn to family
members. Or they might go to court to ask that a guardian be
appointed to make medical decisions. The simplest, most effective
way is to give directions in advance about who has authority to
decide, and about what treatment is wanted or not wanted.
   Living wills are the most common document used to plan for future
medical care. Forty states have statutes recognizing living will
declarations. A living will gives directions about the medical
treatment you do or do not want in the event you are terminally ill
and unable to make treatment decisions or give directions to
doctors. It also names the person you decide should carry out your
wishes or should act on your behalf.
   There are limitations to the use of living wills. Because they
can be used only when a person is terminally ill and death is
imminent, they do not help incompetent patients who are not
terminal. If the treatment in question is not ``life-prolonging,''
it also may not be covered.
   Thus, a living will is not effective for an Alzheimer's patient
who needs some medical treatment, such as a cataract operation, but
is unable to give the necessary medical consent to the operation.
Many states prohibit implementation of the declaration if the
patient is pregnant. Others exclude certain types of care from those
that the patient may request to be withheld or withdrawn.
   In the past, powers of attorney were used for financial matters.
The person giving the power (the principal) designates someone else
(the attorney in fact or agent) to make business and financial
decisions for him or her _ sell real estate, invest money, sign a
business contract.
   Traditionally, the principal had to be competent; the power of
attorney terminated upon the principal's incapacity or death.
However, under current law a power of attorney can be ``durable''
and endure or continue in effect even if the principal is
incompetent. More important, states now recognize that the powers
conferred by a durable power of attorney may include the authority
to make health care decisions on behalf of the principal.
   A durable power of attorney for health-care decision-making is a
more versatile document than a living will declaration. It can be
used for all medical decisions, not just those about life-prolonging
treatment, and by all people, not just those who are terminally ill.
In the example given above, if the Alzheimer's patient, while
competent, had executed a durable power of attorney authorizing
someone to make health-care decisions, the person named in the
document would be able to consent to or refuse the cataract
operation.
   Durable powers of attorney can be used to request that
life-sustaining treatment be continued or to request that such
treatment, including food and water, be withheld or withdrawn. Most
important, they allow you to say who should be responsible for
making health-care decisions if you are not able to do so.
   While only some states have specific laws about medical durable
powers of attorney, all states recognize their use. Each state has
its own requirements about who may be named the agent to make the
medical decisions, who may witness the document, and the form the
document should take. States have similar requirements for living
wills.
   A durable power of attorney for health-care decision-making is a
necessary document to protect your right to make health-care
decisions even if you are incapacitated. Simply executing a will, or
signing a durable power of attorney directed to business and
financial matters will not ensure that this right continues past
your incapacity.

<HEAD>Dentists Should Watch For Abuse of Older Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dentists can help detect abuse or neglect in their
elderly patients because the signs include head, neck and facial
injuries.
   Dr. Thomas J. Bomberg, a professor at the University of Colorado
School of Dentistry, surveyed 3,000 randomly selected U.S. dentists.
Out of the 1,417 who replied, 3 percent had seen or treated an
elderly victim of abuse or neglect and 7.6 percent had suspicions of
such problems among older patients.
   ``In spite dramatic increases in the rate of utilization of
dental services by the aged in recent years,'' Bomberg said, ``The
role of the dentist in the detection, identification, treatment and
follow-up in cases of abuse in the elderly has been largely
ignored.''
   Thirty-eight percent of all abuse involves head, neck or facial
injuries, including broken teeth, facial and lip cuts and broken
jaws, he said.

<HEAD>Hotline Helps Needy Older Americans Get Medical Eye Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People 65 and older can get medical care for
their eyes even if they can't afford it by dialing a nationwide
toll-free helpline at 1-800-222-EYES.
   The National Eye Care Project Helpline has referred nearly
150,000 elderly patients to eye doctors since it was set up three
years ago, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
   To qualify, a patient must be at least 65 and no longer have
access to an eye doctor he or she saw in the past.
   The program pays only for office medical care, not for
eyeglasses, prescription drugs or treatment in hospitals. It was
established to detect and treat eye disease, which is common among
the elderly and can cause blindness.
   The Helpline operates from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Pacific time, or 11
a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern time.
   Qualified callers are matched with an eye doctors in their areas.
Doctors have agreed to provide treatment at no cost to the patients.
Patients without medical insurance are treated free of charge; for
those covered by Medicare or other insurance, the doctors will
accept that as payment in full.

<HEAD>Florida Establishes Panel Honoring Claude Pepper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new state commission named for the
late Rep. Claude Pepper will provide a ``road map to the 21st
century'' in dealing with issues of interest to older Floridians,
Gov. Bob Martinez says.
   Martinez signed legislation this month that creates the Claude
Pepper Commission on Aging, whose mandate is to not only protect the
state's 3 million residents over age 60 but also to find ways to
enrich their lives.
   Pepper, D-Fla., who died in May at 88, was the nation's leading
spokesman on issues of concern to older Americans.
   The 18-member panel, which will be controlled by the governor's
office, will serve as an advisory body to the governor and Cabinet,
the Legislature and the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.
   Six of the commissioners will be appointed by the governor, six
by the speaker of the House and six by the president of the Senate.
Six would have to be over age 60.
   The measure also sets standards for adult congregate living
facilities, creates intermediate facilities to bridge the gap
between congregate homes and nursing homes, bolsters the adult
protective services program to prevent abuse of the elderly and
apprehend abusers and offers housing assistance.

<HEAD>Hospital Company Announces Buyout Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical International Inc.
announced it has reached an agreement with IMA Holdings Corp. for
the investment group to acquire the hospital chain for $2.14 billion
in a two-step transaction.
   A subsidiary of IMA Holdings Corp., a company formed by Harry
Gray, Mel Klein &amp; Partners L.P. and First Boston Investments Inc.,
will launch a tender offer of $28 per share for 68,814,805 shares of
AMI, or about 94 percent of its outstanding common stock.
   A subsidiary of IMA Holdings will then merge with AMI, and the
remaining 6 percent of outstanding common stock will be converted
into common stock of IMA Holdings, the companies announced Friday.
   ``We look forward to working with our new shareholders and
partners who share our objective to make AMI's hospitals the
highest-quality providers in their communities,'' said Richard A.
Gilleland, chairman , president and chief executive officer of AMI.
   Beverly Hills-based AMI owns 75 hospitals in the United States
and abroad.
   Part of the financing for the leveraged buyout will include $250
million in equity supplied by Harry Gray, Mel Klein &amp; Partners L.P.,
and First Boston.
   The remainder of the financing will come from a syndicate of
lenders organized by Chemical Bank. The bank agreed to provide $800
million of the debt, and said it is confident it can arrange the
balance of $920 million. First Boston Securities Corp. has committed
to provide $712 million in subordinate debt.
   The aquisition agreement is subject to the successful financing
of the deal.
   In turn, AMI must agree not to declare or pay common stock
dividends until the merger is closed.
   To help repay the debt incurred in the buyout, AMI will consider
selling its 25 acute-care and psychiatric hospitals in Europe,
Gilleland told The New York Times.
   AMI put itself up for sale after it received a $1.7 billion
buyout offer from a group including its largest individual
shareholder, Dr. M. Lee Pearce. Clayton &amp; Dubilier, a New York
investment firm, later said it backed Lee's bid.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher, but off their best
levels, at midday Monday, as an initial speculative run-up in early
trading evaporated when no follow-through buying emerged.
   Market watchers said trading got off to a good start on weekend
press coverage that the lower dollar and easier U.S. interest rates
would bode well for global economies. In addition, the press
comments mentioned a handful of potential bids, sparking a buying
spree in selected stocks.
   But buying later dried up, as players adopted a more cautious
stance amid a week chock full of economic indicators from both sides
of the Atlantic.
   At about 12:15 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was 3.9 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,193.0, slightly
above its early morning minimum of 2,192.4. At midmorning, the index
had risen as much as 8.4 points to 2,197.5.
   Volume came to a light 218.1 million shares by midday, compared
with 565.2 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>New Iraqi Pipeline To Start Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's $1.5 billion oil pipeline across
Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea will open on schedule in September,
significantly boosting its export capacity, the Middle East Economic
Survey reported Monday.
   However, Iraq said it would adhere to its Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries production quota of 2.783 million
barrels a day despite its increased capacity.
   The respected oil industry weekly quoted an unidentified senior
Iraqi oil source as saying that delays caused by a four-month strike
at South Korea's Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co., which was
producing units for an offshore terminal, ``have been absorbed.''
   The strike, which ended in April, had triggered speculation that
the opening of the 56-inch, 580-mile pipeline would be delayed until
the end of the year.
   The pipeline will link into another pipeline that runs from
Iraq's southern port of el-Zubair. It was built along with pipelines
through Turkey during the Iran-Iraq war, when Baghdad's vital oil
export routes through the Gulf were cut off.
   The offshore terminal in the Red Sea will be able to handle
tankers of up to 400,000 tons. At least one of three planned loading
berths will now be ready by September, the newsletter reported.
   The pipeline is being built by Italy's Saipem Co. for a
consortium that includes Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and
Mitsubish Corp, Italy's Snamprogetti and France's Spie Capag Co.
   IPSA-2, as the pipeline is called, will have an initial capacity
of around 800,000 barrels a day, with full capacity of 1.65 million
barrels a day early next year, MEES reported.
   With export capacity from the southern el-Bakr terminal on the
Persian Gulf expected to rise to 2 million barrels a day next year,
Iraq's production capacity should reach an estimated 4.5 million
barrels a day next year.
   Oil Minister Issam Abdul al-Chalabi sad last month that war
damage to the al-Bakr platform, a deep water terminal, has been
repaired.
   The weekly newsletter reported that Iraq's oil policy was based
on Iraq's desire to maximize revenue and stabilize prices ``rather
than a maximization of production and price competition.''
   Baghdad also prefers ``strategic flexibility to give the country
the necessary options after its experience in the Gulf War, when at
one point only the Turkish pipeline, with less than 1 million
barrels a day capacity, was in operation.''

<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The extra 400 cars a day being produced by
a second shift at Toyota Motor Corp.'s main assembly plant may
double annual production and still not meet customer requests,
company officials said.
   ``We've had a problem meeting the market's demand for Camrys,''
said Alex Warren, senior vice president of administration for Toyota.
   The Camry is one of the top-selling cars in the United States.
Last year, more than 200,000 were sold here. This year, Toyota
expects sales of 250,000 to 260,000, Warren said.
   As of June, Toyota had only enough cars in inventory to sell for
23 days, said Debra Sanchez Fair, a spokeswoman for Toyota Motor
Sales U.S.A. in Torrence, Calif. The industry standard for normal
inventory is 60 days.
   ``The Camry is our No. 1 volume vehicle,'' she said. And June was
a record month, despite a slowdown in the auto industry.
   By year end, Toyota management expects the Georgetown plant to
make 800 cars a day _ 200,000 a year. This past week, the first
shift was producing 400 a day while the second shift was making 275.
   Warren said there is no specific timetable for the acceleration.
   ``We're not as worried about the numbers as we are the quality,''
he said.
   Hiring at the plant is complete, and the new employees trained
with the first shift through May and early June. Slowly, the hours
for the second shift were changed so the workers could spend some
time working on their own each day. In mid-June, the two shifts were
completely split.
   The first shift works from 6:15 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. The second
shift works from 5:15 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. Hiring for the second shift
began in January and ended two weeks ago.
   The plant now employs between 2,800 and 2,900, with about 1,250
workers on the line for each shift, Warren said.
   Hiring for the power-train plant _ where engines, axles and
steering components will be assembled _ will continue through the
end of 1990. By then, the two plants could employ as many as 3,500,
Warren said. The power-train plant is scheduled to be completed by
next summer.

<HEAD>Rail, Dock Disputes Begin Week of Labor Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Rail train drivers began an overtime ban
and dockworkers said they would strike at midnight on Monday, in
what threatens to be the worst week of industrial unrest in Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 years in power.
   More than 500,000 town hall staff throughout Britain planned a
48-hour strike for Tuesday and Wednesday, and unions said the
national rail service and London's subway system would again grind
to a halt on Wednesday.
   British Rail said 120 of its 500 morning rush hour trains were
canceled in its busy southern region surrounding London because of
the overtime ban by the 17,500 members of the Associated Society of
Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.
   A spokesman said one in three scheduled trains did not arrive
Monday morning at Waterloo Station, London's main rail station south
of the River Thames, and 17 percent of trains were not running into
central London's Victoria Station.
   Leaders of all three railways unions, the engineers, the National
Union of Railwaymen and the Transport and Salaried Staffs
Association, were scheduled to meet Monday to discuss their disputes
with British Rail over pay and bargaining arrangements.
   British Rail has imposed a 7-percent pay raise on the Transport
and Salaried Staffs Association, which represents 30,000 white
collar workers.
   The Railway Staff National Tribunal, the industry's arbitration
body, has recommended that it be increased to 8.8 percent, closer to
the national average wage settlement of 9.3 percent. The association
is the only one of the three rail unions to participate in the
tribunal.
   If British Rail approves the tribunal's recommendation, it must
then decide whether to offer the 8.8 percent increase to all its
130,000 employees.
   General Secretary Jimmy Knapp of the National Unions of
Railwaymen has already said that 8.8 percent is ``way below the
target we are seeking.'' His union is seeking a 10-percent raise.
   The Transport and General Workers Union said 9,400 dockworkers
would begin an indefinite strike at midnight Monday over the
abolition of a scheme which guaranteed them jobs for life.
   Employers fear the disruption at 40 ports could hurt exports and
imports, and worsen the country's merchandise trade deficit.
   A year-long strike by Britain's miners in 1984-85 was far more
bitter than any of the current disputes, but had less impact on
individual Britons.
   In this summer's mounting labor unrest, strikes have regularly
closed passport offices, idled London's red double-decker buses and
blacked out programs on the British Broadcasting Corp.
   North Sea oil workers are involved in rotating strikes over pay
and safety, and ambulance workers and water industry workers have
scheduled votes on industrial action.
   The five million London commuters who rely on trains and subways
will have to find other transportation on Wednesday if, as planned,
London Underground Workers stage their 10th stoppage in 14 weeks and
British Rail is shut down for the fourth time in four weeks.
   The subway workers want a 64-pound, or $104 a week raise to
operate trains without guards. Management has offered 30 pounds, or
$49, plus extra vacation, but is demanding increased productivity.
   The Department of Employment said 256,000 working days have been
lost due to strikes this year up to April, the latest month for
which figures are available. Nearly 30 million working days were
lost during the 1979 winter of discontent which helped Mrs. Thatcher
sweep to power.

<TEXT>
   A group led by U.S. corporate financiers
Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. said Monday it has made a friendly 2.15
billion-pound, or $3.48 billion, cash offer for Gateway Corp. PLC in
what would be Europe's largest leveraged buyout.
   The group, which also includes Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co.
and is known as Newgateway PLC, said it had gained control of 30.04
percent of the British food retailer following a market raid on
Friday.
   Gateway also is the target of a hostile 2.05 billion-pound, or
$3.32 billion, cash bid from Isoceles PLC, a company formed by
disgruntled institutional shareholders in Gateway. Isosceles last
reported controlling about 41 percent of Gateway's shares.
   Newgateway said it acquired a 19.66 percent stake on the open
market, raising the total number of shares under its control to
267.8 million. Friday's purchases were made at 242 pence, or $3.92,
a share.
   On Monday afternoon, Gateway shares were unchanged at 240 pence,
or $3.89, on London's Stock Exchange.
   Newgateway has said it has the resources to buy more than 50
percent of the British food retailer's shares in the open market.
   Isoceles, in addition to offering 230 pence a share in cash, has
offered an alternative of up to 250 pence a share in cash and
securities, or a total of up to 2.23 billion pounds.

<TEXT>
   Utility and gasoline prices soared
and the national currency's value was halved today as the new
government began imposing measures it hopes will end the worst
recession in Argentina's 173-year history.
   ``Argentina is bankrupt,'' Economy Minister Miguel Roig said
Sunday night in a nationwide address. Policies to nurture the
country to health ``will be exceptional and, lamentably, very
harsh.''
   The plan also envisions cutting back drastically on government
spending, selling off many state-run industries, scaling back
subsidies and tax breaks for private companies and enforcing widely
ignored tax laws.
   ``We have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia ... If not,
Argentina has no future,'' said President Carlos Menem, who on
Saturday took over this country where runaway inflation has provoked
food riots this year.
   In another development, Menem on Sunday suggested Argentina and
Britain temporarily set aside their claims to the Falkland Islands
and discuss resuming diplomatic relations.
   In London, the British Labor Party today urged the Conservative
government to take up the offer.
   A statement by the British Foreign Office said it was examining
what Menem said at his inauguration. It said if the Argentines are
moving toward excluding sovereignty from discussions on rusuming
diplomatic ties, ``then the prospect for progress may be opening
up.''
   Britain and Argentina went to war in 1982 over the islands 350
miles off the Argentine coast, which Britain has ruled since 1833.
Diplomatic ties have remained broken ever since.
   In the economic address on Sunday night, Roig told reporters he
expects the country's 31 million people to begin feeling the results
of the austerity measures in 2{ years.
   Gasoline prices went up 610.5 percent, from 152 to 1,080 australs
per gallon, or about 23 cents to $1.65. Electricity and telephone
fees rose by about 200 percent, the government news agency Telam
said.
   Natural gas prices will rise 640 percent for businesses, 200
percent for homeowners. Roig did not say when the new rates would
take effect.
   Hefty fare increases for buses, subways, commuter trains and
airplanes will take effect July 17, government spokesmen said. The
rates were not announced.
   Beginning today, the austral will sell for 655 per dollar,
bringing its value in line with the black market and intending to
encourage exporters to sell foreign currency to the Central Bank,
which has low cash reserves.
   The official rate on Friday was 303 to the dollar. The
devaluation amounted to 53.7 percent.
   The measures are aimed at curtailing inflation that in June
soared by 114.5 percent and narrowing a budget deficit estimated at
12 percent to 15 percent of the gross national product.
   The two are linked: the former government of President Raul
Alfonsin financed the deficit _ caused in large part by operating
losses at state-run companies _ by printing money or borrowing
abroad.
   Neither avenue is open to Menem, who was elected May 14. The
nation is $4.5 billion in arrears in interest payments on the $60
billion foreign debt, and inflation is out of control.
   The projected 12-month cost of living increase based on June's
rate amounts to a staggering 948,597 percent. The austral, valued at
18 per $1 in February, has lost 97 percent of its value in five
months.
   Inflation and devaluation touched off a recession in which real
wages have fallen by at least 35 percent this year and unemployment
has climbed to 10 percent.
   Workers would be shielded somewhat from the effects of the new
measures by controls on the prices of milk, bread and other basic
commodities, and a small, one-time pay increase this month, Roig
said. The pay increase, which will go to salaried workers and
retirees, amounts to 8,000 australs, about $12.
   The danger is more social unrest. Labor unions denounced price
hikes in the past weeks, and hungry shantytown dwellers looted food
stores again last week in Rosario, the country's third-largest city.
   Roig said the only solution was a free market policy where the
private sector would provide services now offered by the government.
   Legislation will be sent to Congress to give Menem sweeping
authority to privatize state companies, Roig said. State subsidies
to private companies _ tax breaks, reduced rates for energy, soft
loans _ will be scaled back, and tax laws enforced.

<TEXT>
   A $1 billion-plus tax claim against Nelson
Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt could consume what remains of
the tycoons' inheritance from fabled Texas oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt.
   A trial that began today in U.S. Tax Court pitting the Hunts
against the Internal Revenue Service could determine whether the
brothers will have any money left to repay their other creditors in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Once billionaires, Bunker now lists his assets at $258.83 million
and Herbert says he's worth $169.38 million, according to documents
filed in Bankruptcy Court in Dallas as part of their Chapter 11
reorganization.
   The IRS has claims totaling $701 million in disputed taxes and
interest against Bunker and $317 million against Herbert. Today's
case involves only the 1982 tax year and claims of $150 million each
against the two brothers.
   Attorneys in the case expect the non-jury trial before U.S. Tax
Court Judge Jules G. Korner III to last about three to four weeks.
   As a priority creditor in the bankruptcy case, the government's
claim moves ahead of most others when the Hunts' assets are divided
up.
   ``The Hunts don't have enough money to pay everybody. Our claim
might eat up every penny that they have,'' said Grover Hartt, an
attorney in the Justice Department's tax division.
   ``We have claims in excess of $1 billion in the aggregate for
both brothers,'' said Hartt, who is monitoring the government's
claim. ``The largest single part of that is the 1982 tax year.''
   The trial's outcome could affect IRS claims affecting other
years, Hartt said Friday from Dallas. The Hunts and the IRS are
disputing taxes owed in several years between 1974 and 1988.
   The dispute over the 1982 taxes centers on the dissolution of
what the Hunts contend was a partnership created to repay the
brothers' debts from the 1980 silver price collapse. The IRS claims
the partnership actually was a loan the Hunts did not repay, and
thus constitutes taxable income.
   In a separate case, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
alleges that the Hunts and other international businessmen were
involved in a price-fixing scheme to corner the world silver market.
In court documents, the commission claims that had the scheme not
collapsed ``by the end of May 1980, they could have owned virtually
the entire world supply of deliverable .999 silver bullion.''
   The 1982 tax case also involves a third brother, Lamar Hunt.
Lamar, who is not in bankruptcy court with his brothers, is
contesting about $500,000 in taxes.
   The government has listed as trial exhibits some 1,300 documents
filling four boxes, attorneys say, with several hundred more filed
by the Hunts' cadre of lawyers.
   On the witness list are the three Hunt brothers, their sisters
Margaret Hunt Hill and Caroline Rose Hunt, a nephew and a cousin,
and experts on coal and silver.
   Michael Henke, an attorney representing Bunker and Herbert Hunt,
said the partnership ``darn sure was a partnership'' and not a sham
as the government contends.
   Henke said the Hunts contributed substantial assets to the
partnership, including stocks in gold mining companies worth more
than $100 million and $294 million in coal properties. The
partnership also received $825 million out of a $1.1 billion bank
loan to Placid Oil Co., which is controlled by six Hunt trusts,
including those of the three brothers.
   There was no taxable income as a result of the partnership's
dissolution, Henke said.

<DATELINE>CROSSETT, Ark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 plywood workers at five
Georgia-Pacific plants in Arkansas and Mississippi went on strike
this morning after the breakdown of contract talks about overtime
pay.
   The walkout forced the temporary shutdown of the mills.
   A Georgia-Pacific spokesman said the strike involves about 1,000
union workers at mills in Crossett and Fordyce in Arkansas, and a
roughly equal number of workers at mills in Louisville, Taylorsville
and Gloster, Miss. The plants belong to Georgia-Pacific's
Mid-Continent Division.
   Workers at Crossett and Gloster are represented by the
International Woodworkers' of America. Workers at Fordyce,
Louisville and Taylorsville are members of the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners.
   Union and company negotiators had continued talks past two
deadlines following the June 1 expiration of the old contract, but
the unions rejected the company's latest offer Wednesday and pickets
went up at the mills about 5 a.m. today.
   The plants manufacture southern pine plywood for residential and
commercial construction. Spokesman Terry Hadaway at the Crossett
plant said the company would shut down the plants at least
temporarily.
   ``The plans are currently to conduct orderly shutdown of each of
those operations. Beyond that we're evaluating the circumstances to
determine what our next action will be,'' Hadaway said today. He
would not speculate on how long the plants would be idled, nor would
he detail the contract dispute.
   Union officials said the company's latest offer called for a
four-year contract, with pay increases of 2 percent the first,
second and fourth years of the pact and 3 percent the third year.
The unions wanted a three-year contract with pay increases of 3
percent each year.
   But the union's main concern was over the company's proposal to
pay workers regular wages for working on Sunday and dropping time
and-a-half wages paid under the old contract. The company offered
Sunday workers a one-time bonus of $800 to $1,000.
   Steve Price, president of IWA Local 5-475 in Crossett, said the
loss of Sunday premium pay would cost maintenance workers about
$2,300 a year and would mean about $1,400 in lost wages for utility
employees. Also, he said, about 30 percent of workers at the
Crossett plant don't work on Sunday and would not get the bonus.
   Minimum hourly pay at the plants is $7.90, Price said.
   The strike marks the second time in four years that
Georgia-Pacific workers have walked off the job. Members of the
United Paperworkers Union staged a three-month strike in 1985.

   Stock prices gained ground in quiet trading today
amid expectations of further easing of the Federal Reserve's credit
policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.92 to 2,496.78 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 729 up, 439
down and 526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 39.56 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said talk of a recent gradual turn by the Fed toward a
policy of easier credit has been reinforced by a decline in the
interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks.
   Rates on long-term government bonds, which crested well above 9
percent earlier this year, have lately dropped to the threshold of 8
percent.
   Wall Street's optimists argue that the decline in the cost of
borrowed money will help cushion the business impact of slowing
economic growth, which has been evident for the past several months.
   Worries persist in the financial world, however, about the
prospective effects of a throttled-down economy on corporate profits.
   American Medical International led the active list, up 3[ at 26\.
The company, which put itself on the block last month, agreed to be
acquired by an investor group for $26.50 a share in cash plus new
stock.
   Takeover rumors and speculation sparked buying in such issues as
UAL, up 3 at 169, and Honeywell, up 2\ at 80.
   Gainers among the blue chip and technology stocks included
General Motors, up \ at 40]; International Business Machines, up 1[
at 113\, and Digital Equipment, up 1[ at 96~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.56 to 182.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .22 at 363.97.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, weighed down
by forecasts for increasing chances of rain in the Midwestern Corn
Belt as the week progresses.
   The corn market opened with unexpectedly sharp losses despite a
weekend of extremely hot, mostly dry weather in most growing areas.
   ``I think the main impact here is the chance of rain,'' said
William Biedermann, a vice president and director of research with
Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage based in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   The wheat market was modestly lower in response to
better-than-expected yields of winter wheat. Harvesting of the crop
is nearing completion in the Great Plains.
   The main event in the grain markets this week should be the
Agriculture Department's report on corn and soybean plantings, which

   Chase Manhattan Bank lowered its prime lending
rate by a half percentage point to 10.5 percent today, the second
such reduction in as many months.
   Other major commercial banks were expected to follow suit in
cutting the rate, which is a benchmark used to set interest on a
variety of consumer and business credit.
   The decrease _ which was effective immediately _ had been widely
expected and comes amid building perception in the financial markets
that the Federal Reserve is seeking looser credit policies in
response to a slowdown in economic growth.
   Short-term interest rates in the bond market have been falling
steadily as a result.
   Bond and stock prices were moderatly higher following today's
announcement, while the dollar was little changed.
   ``If the current interest rates scenario continues it will
benefit a lot of people ... especially those looking to buy a
house,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Because the prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing
money, including interest it pays on savings accounts or
certificates of deposit, it trails more subtle increases in other
interest rates in the credit markets.
   Still, the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a
basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many
types of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage rates
are not included in that category.
   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. The banks
raised it twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a half
percentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changing
concerns about economic growth and inflation.
   The latest decrease puts the key lending rate at its lowest level
since Feb. 10, when it was raised from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.

<HEAD>A Recession Resistant Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While recession dulls the roar of the nation's
factories and lessens the rumble of economic activity in general,
you can always hear the hammers and saws.
   Homeowners see to it. For myriad reasons, chief among them being
their love of home sweet home, Americans continue to change, repair,
improve and add to their homes through good times and bad.
   Since 1970 there have been three recessions _ in 1974, 1979 and
1982 _ but only in the most recent, and especially severe, downturn
did spending on repairs and improvements falter, and then by an
almost trivial 2.3 percent.
   Last year, after having risen at a compound annual rate of 11.5
percent since 1970, expenditures topped $100 billion and they are
running at a rate higher than that in 1989. Chances are strong they
will rise next year too.
   Even when adjusted for inflation, says Kenneth Klein, who heads
the National Association of Home Builders remodeling council, it
remains the fastest-growing sector of the entire construction
industry.
   With Wall Street now worrying about another recession _ it is
forever rubbing its hands in fear of inflation or in anticipation of
expansion _ you'll be hearing a lot about the subject in the next
few weeks.
   But, while Wall Street loves the repair and remodeling industry
because it offers a safe haven in bad times, the more interesting
story is how the industry reflects the persistence of homeowners in
changing things around.
   Housing is considered cyclical. That is, when times are good
people buy homes. Most of the homes purchased each year are existing
homes, and these must be adapted to the new owners' likes and needs.
Out come the hammers and saws.
   When times aren't so good people tend to forego purchasing.
Instead, they draw closer to the old hearth; they decide to stay
where they are and fix up to meet their changing needs.
   No matter what the economy is doing _ expanding, stagnating,
regressing _ Americans continue to spend on improvements and
repairs. It is, in a sense, a participant sport, although most of
the dollars are spent with professionals.
   Involvement with the house goes back a long, long way, of course,
but two relatively recent factors have helped spur activity.
   One is housing inflation. It forced new homebuyers to purchase
houses that were less than their heart's desire and then fix them
up. It caused some existing homeowners to stay where they were and
put on additions.
   For the latter, the money came from home equity loans. A decade
ago it was difficult to borrow on the house; now it can be as easy
as writing a check. And, as most homeowners know, to borrow on the
house is to lower income taxes.
   Something always seems to develop to abet activity _ not that
Americans need any spurs. The latest appears to be falling interest
rates. And another is already appearing on the distant horizon.
   That distant horizon is viewed as gray by many in the housing
industry, simply because a decline is coming in the number of people
in the mid-20s to mid-30s, considered the prime homebuying ages.
   The shrinkage of this segment is expected, by itself, to result
in a slight downturn in sales of new homes. But passage of the
population bulge will mean that those who did buy homes in the past
decade will be thinking differently.
   As they age, many of them will be earning more. Wives who had
been tied down with children eventually will be going back to work,
providing an additional household income. Family needs and desires
will be changing.
   It means they'll be in the mood to tamper with the house. And if
they don't tamper they might consider selling, and that means a new
owner with ideas of personalizing the house by remodeling.
   Result: More construction music, more pounding of hammers and
screeching of saws.

   Stock prices pushed ahead in quiet trading today
amid expectations of further easing of the Federal Reserve's credit
policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.48 to 2,497.34 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 801 up, 451 down and
540 unchanged.
   Analysts said talk of a recent gradual turn by the Fed toward a
policy of easier credit has been reinforced by a decline in the
interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks.
   Rates on long-term government bonds, which crested well above 9
percent earlier this year, have lately dropped to the threshold of 8
percent.
   New York's Chase Manhattan Bank and a few smaller banks today
lowered their prime lending rates from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.
   Wall Street's optimists argue that the decline in the cost of
borrowed money will help cushion the business impact of slowing
economic growth, which has been evident for the past several months.
   Worries persist in the financial world, however, about the
prospective effects of a throttled-down economy on corporate profits.
   American Medical International led the active list, up 3[ at 26\.
The company, which put itself on the block last month, agreed to be
acquired by an investor group for $26.50 a share in cash plus new

<HEAD>CVN Agrees To Be Acquired By QVC in Video Shopping Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CVN Companies Inc. has agreed to be
acquired by QVC Network Inc., a smaller competitor in the televised
home shopping business, for more than $400 million in cash and
stock, the companies said today.
   The deal would create a company that backers said could better
compete against the video retailing leader, Home Shopping Network
Inc., in an industry that generated an estimated $1.4 billion in
revenue last year.
   The agreement calls for QVC, of West Chester, Pa., to purchase
all CVN common stock for $19 a share in cash plus one-eighth of a
share in QVC common stock.
   CVN, which operates the Cable Value Network, the Fashion Channel
and America's Shopping Channel, had about 18.3 million shares of
stock outstanding, making that cash portion of the deal worth about
$350 million.
   The stock portion of the deal would add another $40 million to
the price of the transaction at recent prices. QVC closed at $17.88
a share in national over-ther-counter trading while CVN closed at
$18.75 a share.
   CVN also warrants and options outstanding that would add another
$25 million to the value of the deal, the companies indicated.
   The merger is subject to approval by shareholders of both
companies as well as securing federal regulatory approval. The
companies said they hoped the deal could be completed in September.
   QVC, which operates the QVC cable network, has arranged for a
financing commitment of $435 million from the Bank of New York. It
has also received a commitment from Comcast Corp. to buy $30 million
of convertible subordinated debentures.
   QVC had net sales of $213 million in the year ended May 31,
substantially smaller than CVN's $637.8 million in the same period.
However, QVC has an exclusive TV agreement to sell Sears, Roebuck
merchandise.
   CVN reported serving some 23.3 million cable subscribers to 14.1
million for QVC.
   ``The combination of QVC and CVN will allow for more effective
direct marketing efforts which will result in increased subscriber
acceptance and satisfaction,'' CVN Chairman Theodore Deikel said in
a statement. ``The combination will also enhance the opportunities
for long-term growth.''
   CVN said its board decided that the QVC offer would benefit
shareholders more than CVN's previously announced plan to issue a
special $10 a share dividend. If CVN shareholders approve the
merger, the dividend will be canceled.
   After the merger, QVC said it intends to continue both companies'
television shopping programs.
   QVC said it does not intend to make any substantial changes in
CVN operations before the end of the year to allow time for teams
from both companies to evaluate ways to enhance productivity.
   Joseph M. Segal, QVC's chairman, said his company would still
reach fewer homes with its CVN and QVC shopping programs than Home
Shopping Network does.
   But he said QVC would be able to compete more effectively and
``reach a sales level comparable to HSN's'' if the deal goes through
because the company would be abler to offer consumers more
diversified shopping programs and merchandise choices.

<HEAD>Joseph Lelyveld Named Deputy Managing Editor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Lelyveld has been named deputy managing
editor of The New York Times and is expected to succeed Arthur Gelb
as managing editor, the newspaper announced.
   The Times announced that Lelyveld's promotion from foreign editor
was effective July 16.
   Gelb, 65, is expected to retire from the news department early
next year and move to a senior position in the Times Company.
   ``We are therefore temporarily reviving the job of deputy
managing editor so that Arthur and Joe can work side by side to
prepare an orderly transition,'' said Max Frankel, executive editor.
   The Times also announced that David R. Jones, editor of national
editions, will become an assistant managing editor. Bernard
Gwertzman, who has been Lelyveld's deputy, will become foreign
editor.
   Lelyveld, 52, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his book
about South Africa, ``Move Your Shadow,'' has been a reporter in New
York and Washington and a correspondent in the Congo, India, Hong
Kong, Britain and South Africa.
   A graduate of Harvard and the Columbia Graduate School of
Journalism, Lelyveld has been a national correspondent for The Times
Magazine and deputy foreign editor from 1977 to 1980. He became
foreign editor in December 1986.
   Jones, 56, who has been at The Times since 1963, was assistant
news editor of the Washington bureau, assistant national editor and
national editor before being named editor of national editions in
1987.
   Gwertzman, 54, worked as a correspondent in Moscow and served as
chief diplomatic correspondent from 1972 until becoming deputy
foreign editor in 1987. He joined the Times' Washington bureau in
1968.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on London's stock exchange ended
higher Monday, as the market continued to draw inspiration from
takeover speculation.
   However, trading volume was extremely low, reflecting the absence
of strong institutional buying interest, dealers said. A slim 417.6
million shares were traded, compared with the 774.8 million shares
which changed hands Friday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,195.2 at the close, above a late
afternoon low of 2,189.4, but below an early high of 2,197.5.
   ``There's still quite a lot of speculative interest bubbling in
the market,'' one trader said, noting that a shortage of stock among
market makers accentuated the rises in many stock prices.
   Traders said the market also was encouraged by a healthy
performance on Wall Street as London trading wound down.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 5.1 points to close at
1,820.1. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 1.44 points to
close at 1,247.56.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply In Europe, Gold Also Lower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell sharply Monday in European
trading on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to
ease its grip on credit.
   Gold prices were also lower as the market continued to
consolidate gains from last week, dealers said.
   Last Friday's U.S. job figures for June, indicating a slowdown in
the economy, came on the heels of other reports that showed sluggish
growth. Dealers said this was likely to persuade the Federal Reserve
to ease monetary policy and lower interest rates.
   As U.S. interest rates fall, the dollar becomes a less attractive
investment.
   The dollar's decline also gained momentum in Europe because it
broke several key support points on technical charts, they said.
   ``We're still driven by technical factors,'' said a corporate
adviser at a U.S. bank in London.
   ``The market here was dominated by technical trading,'' said a
dealer at a large Frankfurt bank. ``We had executions of stop-loss
orders as the dollar fell, and this drove it even lower.'' A
stop-loss order is an order to sell to minimize losses in a
declining market.
   ``The dollar is bound to be weak until we find a bottom,'' added
one London dealer.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.37 yen to a closing 139.28 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 138.95 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6410 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6245 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.8575 West German marks, down from 1.8840; 1.5960
Swiss francs, down from 1.6200; 6.3005 French francs, down from
6.3915; 2.0988 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1272; 1,354.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,368.00; and 1.18835 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1907.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $381.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $385.25.
   In Zurich, gold was lower, closing at a bid of $383.45 an ounce
compared with $384.60 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 29 cents to close at a bid
$383.27 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $5.21 a troy ounce, compared with
Friday's $5.37.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn, soybean and oat futures closed sharply lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of cooler,
wetter weather in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures finished moderately lower.
   Private meteorologists predicted rainfall of \ inch to 1{ inches
covering 30 percent to 60 percent of the Midwestern corn and soybean
fields by Wednesday.
   Expectations for a bearish mid-week crop report prompted further
selling of corn and soybean futures. The Agriculture Department is
set to release estimates of planted acreage for those crops after
the close of trading on Wednesday.
   Private analysts and traders expect the USDA report to show
modest increases in planted acreage since last year, but many have
lowered their expectations because of heavy rains that have made
planting impossible in parts of the eastern Corn Belt and the
Southeast.
   ``It's one thing to fight weather and another thing to fight
weather if these acreage reports are gong to be negative,'' said Pat
O'Connell, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with Refco Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.99{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 13{ cents lower with July at $2.63 a bushel; oats were 10\ cents

percent earlier this year, have lately dropped to the threshold of 8
percent.
   New York's Chase Manhattan Bank and a few smaller banks today
lowered their prime lending rates from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.
   Wall Street's optimists argue that the decline in the cost of
borrowed money will help cushion the business impact of slowing
economic growth, which has been evident for the past several months.
   Worries persist in the financial world, however, about the
prospective effects of a throttled-down economy on corporate profits.

   Oil futures prices declined Monday in quiet
trading.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, slipped 39 cents to settle at $20.36 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising 45 cents on
Friday. Other contract months also fell.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
August contract for home heating oil closed at 48.79 cents a gallon,
down 0.98 cent. The contract lost 0.12 cent on Friday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery declined 0.13
cent to settle at 56.46 cents a gallon, after rising 0.32 cent
Friday.
   Andrew Lebow, a trader with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said prices appeared to be moving within a broad trading range
amid light volume.
   ``The market's not going anywhere. It's kind of trading
sideways,'' he said. ``There's no real rhyme and reason.''
   Energy futures prices have fluctuated in recent days in response
to labor problems affecting North Sea oil operations, but Lebow said
it was unlikely a they would have a major impact on exports.

   Stock prices rose for the fifth consecutive
session Monday amid expectations of further easing of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 14.80 to 2,502.66,
extending its gain since the start of last week to 62.60 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
966 up, 523 down and 493 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.87 million
shares, down from 166.43 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.99 million shares.
   Analysts said talk of a recent gradual turn by the Fed toward a
policy of easier credit has been reinforced by a decline in the
interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks.
   Rates on long-term government bonds, which crested well above 9
percent earlier this year, have lately dropped to the threshold of 8
percent.
   New York's Chase Manhattan Bank and a few smaller banks lowered
their prime lending rates Monday from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.
   Wall Street's optimists argue that the decline in the cost of
borrowed money will elp cushion the business impact of slowing
economic growth, which has been evident for the past several months.
   Worries persist in the financial world, however, about the
prospective effects of a throttled-down economy on corporate profits.
   American Medical International led the active list, up 3 at 26[
on turnover of more than 13.3 million shares. The company, which put
itself on the block last month, agreed to be acquired by an investor
group for $26.50 a share in cash plus new stock.
   The news prompted buying of other hospital management issues.
Humana gained 1} to 36\ and National Medical Enterprises 1 to 32~,
both joining AMI on the list of new 52-week highs.
   Environmental Systems jumped 2\ to 13}. Late Friday the company
said it received a $14-a-share takeover offer from Brambles
Industries Ltd.
   Takeover rumors and speculation sparked buying in such other
issues as UAL, up 2{ at 168{, and Honeywell, up 4~ at 82|.
   Gainers among the blue chip and technology stocks included
General Motors, up \ at 40]; International Business Machines, up 2{
at 114|; General Electric, up | at 53}, and Digital Equipment, up 1{

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $17.46 billion, or 0.55
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.14 to 182.70.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.25 to 373.12, and S&amp;P's

<HEAD>Purpose of Partnership After Silver Price Collapse Disputed At Tax
Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Texas' Hunt brothers did the best they could in
an ``atmosphere of panic'' after the silver market collapse in 1980,
their attorney said Monday, denying at the start of their tax-claim
trial that they had set up ``a colossal sham'' partnershp.
   However, Internal Revenue Service attorney Deborah Butler told
the judge that the partnership was created to provide ``financial
relief to the petitioners at a time when they needed it very badly''
and was subject to taxes when it was dissolved in 1982.
   Michael Henke, in opening arguments in what is expected to be a
lengthy trial, said the complex partnership created to repay huge
Hunt debts was not subject to $300 million in taxes, as the IRS says.
   Two Hunt brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert, are each
contesting some $150 million in 1982 taxes, while Lamar Hunt is
contesting about $500,000 in taxes. The case, being tried without a
jury, is expected to last up to a month.
   While the 1982 tax year is the sole subject of the trial,
government attorneys have said the outcome could affect other IRS
claims against Bunker and Herbert in other tax years. Those claims,
totaling $1 billion in taxes and interest, are greater than the
assets the brothers have listed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court filings.
   Because the IRS is a priority creditor in Bankruptcy Court, the
outcome of the tax trial also could determine the size of Hunt
settlements with other creditors in their reorganization under
bankruptcy law.
   In opening arguments Monday, Henke, representing Bunker and
Herbert Hunt, argued that the brothers created the partnership with
Placid Oil Co., which is owned by six Hunt family trusts, to cover
massive debts from the March 1980 silver price collapse.
   ``The principal issue which this court will be called upon to
decide is whether the Placid Investments Limited partnership, formed
in 1980, was in fact a bona fide partnership, as petitioners
contend, or merely a colossal sham, as the (IRS) commissioner in
effect asserts,'' he said.
   The brothers' silver problems came to a head, Henke said, at the
end of March 1980 when they were unable to pay $434 million to
Engelhard Corp., a New Jersey-based precious metals dealer and
chemical manufacturer. They owed the money for silver they had
agreed to purchase the previous January.
   ``You will hear testimony from petitioner Herbert Hunt and from
his cousin, Tom Hunt, trustee of one of the trusts owning Placid,
that Engelhard threatened a lawsuit to pierce the six trusts owning
Placid in order to collect the amount owing to them out of Placid's
assets,'' Henke told the judge.
   ``You will also hear Tom Hunt's testimony that he told the
Engelhard representatives the Hunt brothers would go into bankruptcy
before they would allow the trusts to be pierced,'' Henke said.
   Since the silver price collapse, Placid, as well as Bunker and
Herbert Hunt, has filed for reorganization under bankruptcy law.
   Placid, the flagship company of the Hunts' holdings, was
established by their father, the legendary oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt,
in 1935.
   Under the disputed partnership agreement, Placid contributed cash
and notes totaling $824 million, obtained through a $1.1 billion
loan from a consortium of banks.
   The Hunts contributed silver, gold stocks, coal properties and
other assets that Henke said had an ``aggregate gross value of more
than $1 billion and a net contribution value of approximately $408
million.''
   While Henke claims the Hunts contributed coal properties worth
$294 million in 1980, the IRS claims those properties were worth $16
million. And when the partnership was dissolved, the IRS claims the
coal properties were worth $6 million, compared with Hunt claims the
coal properties were worth $262 million.
   Henke said the issue for the court to decide is not the precise
fair market value of the coal properties in 1980, but whether the
value assigned them was reasonable _ ``whether that value reflected
the sort of attention and care in valuation that the parties to a
billion-dollar partnership would have been expected to exercise,
given the atmosphere of panic and resulting very short time frame
with which they were faced.''
   Henke said after the court session that the brothers were in a
``rush-rush'' atmosphere to repay their debts because brokerage
houses faced huge problems and the price of silver could have fallen
further, with the markets going into ``a state of flux.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against several foreign
currencies Monday after a major U.S. commercial bank cut its prime
lending rate.
   Gold prices edged up in U.S. trading after posting minor losses
overseas.
   Currency dealers sold dollars early in U.S. trading when Chase
Manhattan Bank announced it was lowering its prime rate by a half
point to 10{ percent.
   The reduction, effective immediately, was expected to cause other
big banks to lower their primes, which are benchmark rates used to
set interest charges on a variety of consumer and business loans.
   As of late Monday, however, Chase was the only major bank to
enact a rate cut. A regional Midwestern bank had trimmed its key
rate to 10{ percent on Friday.
   The impact of the Chase move was muted because financial markets
have been anticipating interest rate declines for weeks. Lower U.S.
interest rates hurt the dollar by reducing returns on
dollar-denominated investments.
   There is a perception in the markets that sluggish economic
activity eventually will lead to looser credit policies by both
commercial banks and the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank.
   For the time being, though, currency dealers apparently feel
happier holding dollars then letting them go, said Hugh Walsh, a
dealer in the New York office of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank.
   ``People are more concerned right now with getting caught short
dollars,'' said Walsh.
   After the initial selling on Chase's announcement, the dollar
bounced off its lowest levels as buying resumed, Walsh said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.37 yen to 139.28 yen. Later in London
it was quoted at 138.95 yen. In New York the dollar finished at
139.20 yen, unchanged from Friday's late level.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6410 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6245 late Friday.
Later in New York, it cost $1.6390 to buy one pound, compared with
$1.6313 on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Friday included: 1.8638 West German marks, down from 1.8705; 1.6015
Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.3155 French francs, down from
6.3505; 1,354.50 Italian lire, down from 1,355.00; and, 1.18925
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1908.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday:
1.8575 marks, down from 1.8840; 1.5960 Swiss francs, down from
1.6200; 6.3005 French francs, down from 6.3915; 2.0988 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1272; 1,354.50 Italian lire, down from
1,368.00; and 1.18835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1907.
   Gold bullion prices varied.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $384.60 a troy ounce, up $1 from Friday. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $382.50 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, 50 cents higher than the late bid Friday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $381.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $385.25. In Zurich, gold was lower,
closing at a bid of $383.45 an ounce compared with $384.60 late
Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 29 cents to close at a bid
$383.27 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices also were mixed.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to
$5.229 a troy ounce, up from $5.209 Friday. Silver fell in the
London market, trading at a late bid of $5.21 a troy ounce, compared
with Friday's $5.37.

<HEAD>Rain Forecasts Knock Down Corn, Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn, soybean and oat futures prices fell Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in anticipation of cooler, wetter weather in the
Midwestern Corn Belt.
   Wheat futures finished moderately lower.
   On other markets, gold and silver advanced, while energy,
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 5{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.99{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 13} cents
lower with July at $2.63{ a bushel; oats were 10\ cents to 11{ cents
lower with July at $1.47 a bushel; soybeans were 18{ cents to 32{
cents lower with July at $7.43} a bushel.
   The declines in the corn, oat and soybean markets exceeded the
normal daily price limits in those markets, which are, respectively,
10 cents, 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel. The Board of Trade had
raised the limits by 50 percent following limit-up moves in all
three markets last Wednesday. The limits return to normal on Tuesday.
   Private meteorologists predicted rainfall of \ inch to 1{ inches
covering 30 percent to 60 percent of the Midwestern corn and soybean
fields by mid-week.
   Precipitation is badly needed in the western Corn Belt states of
Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Minnesota, particularly with the corn
crop now in the pollination stage. Soybeans are several weeks away
from their most crucial phase.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued after
the close predicted below-normal temperatures and above-normal
rainfall for most Midwestern crop areas during the early and middle
portions of next week.
   Expectations for a bearish Agriculture Department crop report on
Wednesday added to the sell-off of grain and soybean futures.
   Private analysts and traders expect the USDA report to show
modest increases in planted corn and soybean acres for the first
time since 1984.
   ``It's one thing to fight weather and another thing to fight
weather if these acreage reports are going to be negative,'' said
Pat O'Connell, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with Refco Inc.
   Gold and silver futures edged higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to a weak dollar and the third consecutive
decline in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity
prices.
   The CRB index's fall of 3.20 points to 229.25 was perceived as a
recessionary signal.
   Gold settled 90 cents higher across the board with August at
$383.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents to 2 cents higher with
July at $5.229 a troy ounce.
   Most oil futures prices declined in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Andrew Lebow, a trader with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said prices appeared to be moving within a broad trading range
amid light volume.
   ``The market's not going anywhere. It's kind of trading
sideways,'' he said. ``There's no real rhyme and reason.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 39 cents lower to 6
cents higher with August at $20.36 a barrel; heating oil was .49
cent to .98 cent lower with August at 48.79 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 56.46
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
with support stemming from higher prices and pressure coming from
expectations for lower prices due to a slowdown in marketings.
   Pork futures were mostly higher on firmer cash prices.
   Live cattle settled .60 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August
at 69.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20
cent higher with August at 80.97 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent
lower to .48 cent higher with July at 47.37 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .08 cent lower to .75 cent higher with July at
30.77 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Athletic Shoe Maker Builds Future on Diversification, Segmenting
Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Nike Inc. went public in 1980, Business Week
magazine wondered whether the athletic shoe maker's move to the
stock market meant that the jogging craze had run its course.
   Now, at the other end of the decade, the company named for the
Greek goddess of victory is planning for future success around
people's continuing fascination with fitness.
   ``People said Nike has helped but also has taken a ride on the
running boom,'' said Nike co-founder Philip H. Knight. ``What we
used to call the running boom was really just the first shot of the
fitness revolution.''
   Knight, Nike's chairman and chief executive officer, said in an
interview that he believes this revolution has led to lifestyle
changes that will keep the momentum rolling for sales of athletic
shoes.
   Working out has become a habit for more people _ whether they
like it or not _ because they know it's good for them, said Knight.
``You might get bored with sleeping but you've still got to do it.''
   Knight was in New York on Monday to for a news conference, the
first in the Beaverton, Ore.-based company's history, to release
Nike's latest financial results.
   He also delivered his message to Wall Street securities analysts.
The analysts apparently weren't completely satisfied with what they
heard. In nationwide over-the-counter trading, Nike stock sank $1 to
close at $42.75 Monday.
   The company reported a 19.7 percent profit gain for the quarter
ended May 31. Income rose to $36.46 million, or 97 cents a share,
from $30.47 million, or 81 cents a share, in the same quarter a year
earlier. Sales totaled $413.42 million, a 16.6 percent increase over
$354.42 million in the 1988 quarter.
   In the 12 months ended May 31, Nike's earnings rose 64.3 percent
to $167.05 million, or $4.45 a share, from $101.7 million, or $2.70
a share. Sales for the year grew 42.5 percent to $1.71 billion from
$1.20 billion.
   Having had such a good year hasn't made Nike complacent,
particularly because the 1984-1988 period was trying for the
company. Sales, which had been growing steadily, sagged to $876.5
million in 1987 from $1.07 billion in 1986.
   During those years, rival shoe manufacturer Reebok International
Ltd. rode the crest of the aerobics wave to become a major force in
the athletic footwear business. And L.A. Gear carved out a slice of
the market for itself, becoming a brand sought after by girls and
young women.
   Meanwhile, Nike made a few missteps. It introduced entries in the
casual segment of the sports shoe market under the Nike brand name
but they didn't go anywhere. The verdict was that consumers couldn't
accept leisure footwear from a company better known for
high-performance athletic shoes.
   ``It was a little like Levis trying to sell suits,'' Knight
recalled.
   The company seems to have learned from that episode. It no longer
peddles shoes designed for casual wear using the Nike name. In 1988,
it boosted the base of its sport-casual division by debuting i.e., a
line of athletically inspired shoes targeted at women in the 25-35
age group. This year, Nike is bringing out Side 1, a line of sporty
and fashionable shoes for teen-age girls.
   In another move to branch out within the footwear field, Nike
acquired Cole-Haan, a Maine-based maker of high-end dress and casual
shoes, in June 1988.
   Knight said the recent diversification into other footwear
categories has been handled so the brands can develop on their own,
independent of Nike's flagship shoe lines.
   There is the chance of some overlap. For instance, Knight said
Nike's footwear researchers are studying the possibility of
incorporating advances in athletic footwear into street shoes.
   To help build sales growth in the athletic shoe business, Nike
has cultivated individual market segments and developed shoes
ntended for specific pursuits.
   Its running shoes have been joined over the years by footwear for
basketball, walking, hiking and windsurfing, for example. Nike
created a whole new category when it created its cross-training
shoe, aimed at people who follow varied exercise regimens.
   Apparel has become an important part of Nike's business and
Knight said the company is working with retailers to more closely
coordinate the marketing of clothing and shoes.
   ``We think we have a lot of room to grow in apparel,'' Knight
said.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBs 7th graf pvs to UPDATE with closing stock prices.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The struggle for Time Inc. enters a key phase
Tuesday as the media giant and its hostile pursuer, Paramount
Communications Corp., enter a Delaware courtroom for what could be
the pivotal confrontation of their five-week-old takeover fight.
   Paramount, trying to force Time's board to seriously consider its
$12.2 billion hostile bid, will argue that Time put itself up for
sale when it agreed to a friendly stock-swap merger with Warner
Communications Inc. earlier this year and therefore must consider
competing offers.
   Time will argue that its board never contemplated selling the
company and that the agreement with Warner _ which has since been
changed to a $14 billion tender offer for Warner _ stemmed from the
ordinary conduct of Time's business.
   Tuesday's hearing before Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen in
Wilmingon has been anxiously awaited by the companies and their
employees and by Time stockholders, who could profit handsomely if
Paramount's $200 a share bid succeeds. Several major shareholders
also will be in court Tuesday, seeking to stop the Time-Warner
merger.
   Allen's decision could affect more than just these three
companies: if Time loses, the climate for friendly mergers in this
country could change radically. Many of the biggest U.S.
corporations are incorporated in Delaware and subject to its laws.
   Observers have said it is difficult to predict how Allen will
rule. But investors have grown pessimistic about Paramount's chances
of success, and Time's stock price _ which hit a high of $182.75
after Paramount announced its bid June 6 _ dropped back sharply as
some traders decided to take their profits before the battle went to
court.
   Time stock rose $1.12{ to $152.62{ a share Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange. Warner stock rose 25 cents to $62 a share and
Paramount dipped 25 cents to $56.75 a share.
   The issue in Tuesday's hearing, according to Duke University Law
School professor James D. Cox, is whether entering into negotiations
with Warner ``triggers the auctioneer role for the (Time) directors,
or can their conduct merely be judged by the business judgment
rule.''
   The business judgment rule, a widely-followed legal concept,
allows decisions made by directors in the normal course of business
to stand. Courts generally are reluctant to disturb such decisions.
   Time's lawyers might argue that the Time-Warner merger deal was
the result of two years of on-again, off-again negotiations. Time
chairman J. Richard Munro hinted the company was considering a
merger when he told securities analysts last November that Time
intended to be among the growing ranks of global media conglomerates.
   But Paramount might contend _ as the company stated in the
prospectus for its offer _ that its chairman, Martin S. Davis,
raised the possibility of a merger between Paramount and Time ``on
several occasions during the past several years.''
   That raises the question of whether Time entered into the merger
agreement as a defensive step. If that were the case, Time _ which
has rejected the Paramount bid as inadequate and highly conditional
_ would be forced to consider buyout offers.
   Michael Bradley, a law professor at the University of Michigan,
said the planned merger did not appear to meet the criteria under
which a company must be considered up for sale.
   ``If Time were thinking of restructuring or some other drastic
move, like a leveraged buyout, that would cross that threshhold,''
Bradley said. ``It's not clear that the negotiations put them into
that posture.''
   Bernard Black, a professor at the Columbia University School of
Law, said, ``I would be very surprised if the Delaware court stops
Time from buying Warner, partly because it's a pre-existing
transaction.''
   But other observers say the issue revolves around the unequal
stock positions between Time and Warner in their original merger
proposal. Under that agreement, the current Warner shareholders
would have 60 percent of the stock in Time Warner Inc. while the
current Time shareholders would have 40 percent.
   Melvin A. Eisenberg, who teaches law at the University of
California at Berkeley, said, ``It's ridiculous to say Time is
buying if Warner is getting 60 percent of the equity.''
   Under the original merger proposal, Time stockholders would have
received a share in the new company for each share they owned while
Warner shareholders would have received 0.465 of a share of the new
Time-Warner for each of their Warner shares.
   There are other issues for Allen to consider, including whether
Time's shareholders should be allowed to decide the future of the
company.
   Allen's ruling, expected later this week, will not settle the
matter because the losing side is expected to appeal to the Delaware
Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Paramount Offers to Add Interest to Bid for Time if Delays Develop</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Time Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of an important court hearing,
Paramount Communications Inc. said Monday it would add interest to
its hostile $12.2 billion offer for Time Inc. if certain delays
prevent it from closing the deal.
   Paramount said it had amended its offer of $200 per share in cash
for all of Time's stock to give shareholders an additional interest
payment of 9 percent annually if it is delayed beyond 60 days in
getting needed regulatory approvals for transfer of cable licenses
needed to complete the deal.
   The interest would begin accruing 60 days after Time either
agrees or is ordered to refrain from interfering with Paramount's
efforts to obtain FCC and state and local cable regulatory
approvals, Paramount said.
   That would add about $1.50 a share to the bid each month.
   Donald Oresman, general counsel of Paramount, said ``our
willingness to pay interest if the company cannot close its deal
within 60 days ``underscores our confidence that regulatory
approvals can be obtained within that period if Time's
obstructionist tactics are stopped.''
   Time offered no comment on the new terms of Paramount's offer,
but previously rejected Paramount's bid as inadequate and too
conditional, saying among other things that it would likely take a
year or more for Paramount to obtain the necessary approvals for
cable license transfers.
   But a source close to Time said Paramount's addition of interest
to its ``reprsents a belated admission that it will take Paramount a
substantial period of time to obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals.''
   Paramount has contended it could win the necessary approvals
within a few months if it were given the chance, but has complained
that Time has been drumming up opposition among local cable
regulators to Paramount's efforts.
   Paramount stepped into the battle for Time in June as Time neared
a shareholder vote on its proposed merger with Warner Communications
Inc. in a deal that would create the world's largest media and
entertainment company.
   Time subsequently amended its merger plan and now is offering $14
billion in cash and securities for Warner's stock. In making that
bid, Time said it would sweeten its offer at a rate of 9 percent a
year if it were unable to complete the offer within 60 days.
   Paramount's decision to add interest to its tender offer for Time
was announced on the eve of a hearing set for Tuesday in Delaware
Chancery Court over a suit that could determine who will win control
of Time.
   Paramount and some Time shareholders want the court to block
Time's acquisition of Warner. They are expected to argue that Time
put itself up for sale when it agreed to merger with Warner and that
Time has not fairly considered Paramount's bid.
   In a separate filing Monday with the Federal Communications
Commission, Paramount said it already has filed transfer
applications representing the majority of subscribers to cable
systems operated by Time's 82 percent-owned American Television and
Communications Corp. where such approvals are required.

courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other
airlines find lost baggage. In addition, reporting methods vary for

   Be prepared to explain why you are carrying
a camera when visiting Ethiopia, don't travel in the Soviet Union
unless you're in good health, and be sure to have a visa upon
arrival in India or you'll find yourself on the next plane out
regardless of its destination.
   ``Improper sexual relations'' with Chinese citizens are verboten,
and if you are of criminal inclination, never take illegal drugs
into Malaysia, where traffickers face a mandatory death sentence.
   So advises World Status Map, a slick bimonthly publication that
offers such travel advisories and disease warnings below its orange
fold-up map, which colors war zones and other danger spots in red.
   Much of the information comes from the State Department and the
Centers for Disease Control, but publisher Earl W. May of Fairfax
says he uses more than 150 other sources, including the World Health
Organization, the United Nations, world governments and news
services.
   May said in a telephone interview that the idea grew out of his
brother's world travels. May said he offered to find out about civil
unrest and disease in various hot spots for his brother, who worked
for a company that drilled oil around the world.
   He found there was a State Department desk officer for each
country. ``Theoretically, I would have to make 200 calls, and half
the time they weren't at the desk,'' he said.
   He decided there was a need for a publication to pull all of the
available information together.
   The first World Status Map, published by May's WSM Publishing Co.
in Merrifield, came out in 1983. Since then, said May, his
subscription list has grown to more than 2,000 travel agents,
individuals, corporations and universities.
   The most recent map warns that ``detention and heavy fines have
been imposed on visitors engaging in improper sexual relations with
Chinese citizens.''
   May is not sure what those banned relations are.
   Despite the unrest in China, ``it probably is a very safe country
right now'' for travelers, he said. ``China is probably doing all
they can to get those hundreds of thousands of tourists back that
they lost,'' he said.
   Binoculars, cameras and video equipment should not be taken into
Ethiopia, which is ruled by a military government fighting rebels in
the northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   ``In many of these countries you are at great risk if you take a
picture of any building that they consider important to the
government or the military,'' he said.
   If you're ill, a sure way to feel even worse is to travel in the
Soviet Union, said May. ``It has to do with the level of medication
and hospital services available,'' he said.
   May also advised against taking alcoholic beverages, even the
tiny sample bottles offered by airlines, into Kuwait.
   ``It's just your basic dry country,'' he said. ``When you arrive,
if you don't declare with a customs agent that you have liquor, you
are subject to arrest if they find it on you.'' Other Islamic
countries have similar restrictions.
   For anyone planning a trip to Europe this summer, it's a
green-light with orange all the way across the continent on the
latest issue of the map. There is this for visitors coming the other
way, however: A warning that the United States is jailing visitors
who arrive with AIDS unless a waiver has been obtained in advance.
   The World Status Map costs $36 for a year's subscription.

<HEAD>Federal Express Drops Government Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Express Corp., citing paperwork
headaches, is ending its shipments of Defense Department packages
that require special handling, a company spokesman said Monday.
   The decision follows a government study questioning Federal
Express' handling of such packages.
   Federal Express has shipped the Defense Department packages
through the company's ``constant surveillance courier service,''
which requires more checkpoints than normal shipments.
   Those shipments bring in $4 million to $5 million a year, while
Federal Express has total annual revenues of $5 billion, said Dan
Copp, a company spokesman.
   ``The paperwork required, which is very different from our
paperwork, and the inconsistent regulations make it very hard to
deliver a 100 percent service level,'' he said.
   Bruce Edwards, a spokesman for the Military Traffic Management
Command, said the Defense Department shipments handled by Federal
Express will be assigned to other companies.
   While the government was unsure it was getting what it paid for
with the shipments, Edwards said, no intentional wrongdoing was
suspected.
   Of the 1.2 million packages Federal Express processes daily, 700
are constant surveillance shipments. Of those, about 400 are for the
Defense Department, Copp said.
   None of them contained highly classified material or dangerous
explosives, he said.
   The company will continue its constant surveillance service for
other customers, Copp said.
   With constant surveillance, Federal Express employees follow a
package more closely than usual and sign for it as it changes hands,
Copp said.
   Following a government study that questioned whether the
shipments were tracked sufficiently, the Defense Department
suspended Federal Express from handling its packages from May 12
through June 28.
   In its study, the government questioned the handling of 182 of
200,000 Defense Department packages shipped through Federal Express
over the past two years, Copp said.
   Federal Express was able to trace 56 of the questioned shipments
and found that company employees made errors in 27 of them, he said.
   ``Sometimes the shipper, that is the government or a government
contractor, will not have the paperwork right on the front end.
Sometimes our people won't get all the signatures they should have
gotten,'' Copp said.

   A cooling-off period called by the
United Mine Workers was shattered almost as soon as it began Monday
by gunfire at a non-union mine and an explosion that damaged a coal
company trailer.
   The owner of a security agency working at the non-union mine in
Boomer said about 150 people, some in masks and camouflage paint,
ambushed his employees around dawn, overturning two trucks and a car
and injuring several guards.
   In Matewan, union supporters confronted a convoy of 15 to 18
non-union coal trucks shortly before Gov. Gaston Caperton was to
promote an area tourism program, said Bennett Hatfield, whose Rawl
Sales and Processing Co. owns the trucks.
   State police said four trucks were disabled, with some flat tires
and some damage.
   One non-union driver was slightly injured, said a state police
who refused to give her name.
   Caperton arrived after the incident and proceeded with his
schedule.
   Gunfire also was reported at a Mingo County mine.
   UMW President Richard Trumka called the three-day ``memorial
period,'' a work stoppage permitted under the union's national
contract, in what he said was an effort to restore calm to the
Appalachian and Midwestern coal fields.
   More than 30,000 UMW members have been engaged in a wildcat
strike throughout Appalachia and the Midwest in support of 1,900
union members on strike since April against Pittston in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky.
   The wildcat strikers have ignored repeated back-to-work orders
from federal judges.
   In Virginia, an explosion early Monday damaged an office trailer
owned by Clinchfield Coal Co., Pittston's main subsidiary in
Virginia.
   The explosion, believed caused by a bomb, occurred shortly after
midnight along a road near Nora, said State Police Sgt. Mike Frank.
   In West Virginia, Cliff Nuckols, head of a security agency at
Appalachian Mining Inc., said scores of people converged on the mine
entrance in Boomer. Shots rang out, and several guards who scuffled
with the attackers suffered minor injuries, he said.
   ``They sneaked through the weeds. You can't see them. They come
through the weeds and the woods and all of a sudden you're just
looking at them. They're there,'' Nuckols said. ``It was pitch
black. The whole thing happened within 30-40 seconds.''
   State Police are investigating, said Sgt. J.L. Miller. He said
the attackers ``stormed the landing, escorted two guards down the
hill and told them to hit the road.''
   In West Virginia's Mingo County, Sid Young, a driver for
non-union Hampden Coal Co., said the mine was hit by gunfire early
Monday. No injuries were reported.
   The national coal contract allots 10 ``memorial days'' on which
miners do not have to report to work. Such days usually are used to
air labor grievances.
   Westmoreland Coal Co. miners were not included in Trumka's
three-day holiday because its miners in Virginia have used their
allotment.
   But company spokesman Steve Anderson said the miners remained off
the job Monday, their first scheduled day back after their annual
two-week summer vacation.
   ``Everyone might have been too optimistic that we might see
people return to work when the vacations over. It's not happening,''
he said.
   In Philadelphia, Westmoreland announced that it has advised seven
overseas customers, whose shipments represented 308,176 tons, that
it can't ship the coal because of production shortages resulting
from the wildcat strike.
   The company said if production doesn't resume by the end of this
week, it will be unable to fill additional export orders for 165,865
tons.
   Also Monday, a federal judge in Big Stone Gap, Va., sentenced
three striking miners to jail terms ranging from three days to three
months for driving in slow-moving convoys to block coal trucks.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams, who complained last week that
huge fines were doing nothing to stop the convoys, tried another
approach, finding the men guilty of contempt of court, the Wise
County clerk said.
   A fourth miner was found innocent.
   In New York, Trumka joined Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and
Gary White, head of the West Virginia Coal Operators Association, in
assuring Japanese steel officials that the supply of Appalachian
coal is reliable despite the Pittston strike.
   ``We cannot afford to allow the Pittston strike to jeopardize
West Virginia's high standing in international coal markets,''
Rockefeller said in a statement.
   Japan bought 13 million tons of U.S. coal last year, about half
of it from West Virginia and an increase of 3 million tons over 1987.

<HEAD>Greek Bank Sued for $1.5 Billion By Depositors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney representing about 300 depositors in a
Greek bank filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $1.5 billion in damages
and restitution for the depositors, who claim their funds were
removed from the country and frozen.
   Attorney Constantine Kangles said the class-action lawsuit filed
in U.S. District Court would seek treble damages for U.S. depositors
in the National Mortgage Bank of Greece.
   Kangles maintained that the bank used its U.S. offices to prey on
immigrant Greeks by promising them high interest rates on deposits
and that the earnings would be tax-free.
   Last month, federal authorities raided U.S. offices of the bank,
seized documents and arrested 14 of its officers on racketeering
charges.
   A bank spokesman Monday denied the charges in the lawsuit.
   ``Not one bank account in Greece has been frozen,'' said the
spokesman, Dimitris Klitorakis, speaking in Athens.
   ``The reports are incorrect, not to say downright false,''
Klitorakis said. He said the deposits have been transferred to the
Bank of Greece, the nation's central bank, ``and can be requested in
the form of checks or remittances for any destination.''
   The only deposits that had been frozen were those made at the
time of the U.S. authorities' raid, he said.
   He added that the number of people who had requested their money
back was ``negligible.''
   Barry Slotnick, a New York attorney representing the bank, said
all U.S. representative offices of the bank were being staffed and
that American depositors would have access to their funds next week.
   The civil lawsuit against the bank and 14 of its officers came
after federal authorities announced an investigation of the bank and
the officers for racketeering. On June 21, authorities raided seven
branches in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania,
seizing documents and arresting the officers.
   The bank is charged with illegally accepting more than $700
million in deposits from customers in the United States and sending
the money overseas so the depositors could avoid U.S. taxes,
according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New York.
   The National Mortgage Bank of Greece is a separate entity from
the state-owned National Bank of Greece, which also operates in the
United States. The National Bank of Greece owns about 47 percent of
the mortgage bank, according to federal authorities.
   In ads placed in Greek language newspapers, bank officers
promised customers interest rates as high as 18 percent that would
be paid in Greek drachmas and would not be disclosed to U.S.
authorities, Kangles said.
   He said about 300 people are behind the lawsuit, but their ranks
could swell to as many as 3,000. The $1.5 billion represents treble
damages based on an estimated $500 million in deposits involved, he
said.
   The mortgage bank's branches were not even legally authorized to
accept money from customers in the United States, authorities say.
Rather, the U.S. branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of
encouraging investment in Greece.
   Mortgage Bank says deposits in the United States were made at
Bankers' Trust and Atlantic Bank branches, not at Mortgage Bank.
Both those banks, as well as Mortgage Bank, are controlled by the
National Bank of Greece.
