<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a gesture of reconciliation more
than four decades after the end of World War II, the Soviet Union
has released the names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its
prisoner-of-war camps.
   The list was presented to the German Red Cross to coincide with
the arrival Monday of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It was the first time the Soviets had provided a list of German
soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West German officials
said.
   Thousands of German soldiers died in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps
and many prisoners were not released until the early 1950s.
   German Red Cross officials applauded the Soviet action, saying it
was a ``moving gesture of reconciliation and an important first step
in clarifying the fate of these missing men.''
   The Red Cross and another West German group, the Federation for
the Preservation of German War Graves, said they hoped to be able to
inform relatives of the soldiers on the list soon.
   The Red Cross said it hoped that additional lists of missing
soldiers would follow.
   The Kremlin has also agreed allow greater access to several
cemeteries in the Soviet Union where German soldiers are buried.
   German Red Cross President Botho Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein
called the Soviet gesture a ``breakthrough in the humantarian
relations'' between the two nations.
   The bitter legacy of World War II and the Nazi attack on the
Soviet Union has clouded West German-Soviet relations for decades.
   According to official estimates, more than 20 million Soviets
were killed in the war and Nazi armies destroyed vast areas of the
Soviet Union.
   Soviet prisoners of war were subjected to brutal treatment by the
Nazis and thousands died in forced labor and concentration camps
until the German defeat in 1945.

   A Cairo court has sentenced eight people,
four of them Lebanese nationals, to death by hanging for trying to
smuggle more than six pounds of heroin into the country.
   Also Monday, Egypt's parliament passed a new law stiffening
penalties for narcotics users to include the life sentence.
   The sentencings Monday brought to 27 the number of convicted drug
smugglers sentenced this month to death by hanging.
   A court in the port city of Suez last week sentenced to death 19
people, including three Palestinians, an Israeli and a Lebanese-born
naturalized American for trying to smuggle 5.9 tons of opium and
hashish and nearly 600 pounds of heroin.
   All the convicts have the right to appeal the sentence within 40
days.
   Egypt has in recent weeks launched a nationwide anti-drug
campaign.

<TEXT>
   The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille.
   Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open
July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution.
   French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on
the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July
14, 1789 _ will finally put Paris on the international music map.
For the moment, doubts remain.
   The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when Israeli
conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired because of what President
Francois Mitterrand's representative said were his high fees and
``elitist views'' on opera.
   Pierre Berge, the head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire
and the man Mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final
days, said Barenboim's replacement would be someone who understood
the president's wish to create a ``modern and popular opera''
accessible to the masses.
   Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when
that someone turned out to be Myung-Whung Chung, a 36-year-old
Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and
unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player
eager to work ``in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille
administrators.
   Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting
that has beset the project from the start, he said, ``If there is a
fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I won't fight. I'll just
leave.''
   Although Berge declined to divulge Chung's salary, he said his
five-year contract requires the maestro be in Paris for 27 weeks a
year for a minimum of 30 performances,
   Chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on ``popular
opera.''
   ``Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get
in,'' he said in an interview. ``I'd like to broaden the opera-going
public and see more young people and students in the audience.''
   Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural
concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before Mitterrand,
President George Bush and other luminaries.
   French conductor Georges Pretre will conduct the Paris Opera
Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international
celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas.
The concert will be staged by American director Bob Wilson, the
longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is
scheduled for next February. Although Chung did not reveal the
program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself.
   The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and
stainless steel designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott. Critics
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the Place de
la Bastille in eastern Paris. The prison was torn down during the
revolution.
   A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate,
century-old Paris Opera is not. The Palais Garnier may be a landmark
known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated
ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades.
   The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and
virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built
elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was
staggering, and so were ticket prices.
   Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun
of 250 francs (about $40), less than half their cost at the Palais
Garnier, which from now on will be devoted to ballet.
   The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to
the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below.
   All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10
minutes.
   Michael Dittmann, the scenic director who drew up the technical
specifications, calls the Opera Bastille ``practical, not
sophisticated.''
   ``Sophisticated means complicated, and this building isn't
complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building. ``It's very
simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we don't
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between
performances.''
   The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet
high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes.
   A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load
the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without
monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage,
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate.
   There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas,
connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a
musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the
orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for
singers and 12 for musicians.
   While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the
main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were
busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood
floors and installing cushions.
   Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black
and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part,
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of
Japanese pagodas.
   Dittmann says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are
excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics
in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through
when they are empty.
   A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from
the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille.
   ``If that isn't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted
with special rubber tires,'' he said.

   Take a population rejected by society for its
misdeeds. Then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold and
the afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient medical
care. That's the impact of AIDS in prison. ``Prisoners are regarded
as ... people who don't matter. It's a double stigma for inmates
with AIDS,'' said Nick Fruedenberg, a New York expert on AIDS
counseling and education. The second story in a three-part AP Extra
series, ``Medicine Behind Bars,'' addresses care and treatment of
inmates with AIDS.

   Carmen Harris, isolated with other female
Alabama prisoners carrying the AIDS virus, feared she would bleed to
death in her cell.
   Stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open, but nurses
on three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in November
1987, she said.
   ``They was afraid of the blood. They was afraid of catching the
virus. They had a fear of the word AIDS,'' said Ms. Harris, who
waited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near Montgomery.
   ``You're treated like an alien, like you had the plague,'' she
said. ``I got sentenced for manslaughter. The judge could have just
as well sentenced me to death row. It's like being punished for my
crime and my diagnosis.''
   Behind prison walls, AIDS is a crackling health issue.
   Some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if they
haven't developed symptoms. Those in segregation consider it cruel
confinement to a new death row. Prison officials defend it as a way
to contain the virus and protect those infected from harm.
   While arguments can be made for segregation, nothing excuses the
failure to provide medical care, inmates' advocates say. Yet prisons
aren't equipped to treat the long-term debilitating illnesses
wrought by AIDS.
   ``Those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medical
attention. They are being condemned to waste away,'' said Benjamin
Schatz, director of the AIDS Civil Rights Project of the National
Gay Rights Advocates. ``They are treated as if infection indicates
they have done something wrong.''
   ``AIDS has made the job of providing prison health care more
difficult, more hazardous and more expensive,'' said Curtis Prout,
director of the internship program at Harvard Medical School.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmitted
during homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles while
injecting drugs, two behaviors common among prisoners.
   In the most recent count last October, 3,136 AIDS cases had been
diagnosed among the U.S. prison population of more than 627,000,
according to the National Institute of Justice. AIDS in prison
increased 60 percent last year, as against a 76 percent jump in the
general population, which can pursue high-risk behaviors more freely.
   Alabama and five other states _ California, Georgia, Nevada,
Tennessee and Wyoming _ segregate prisoners who carry the HIV virus
that causes AIDS, whether or not they have the disease.
   Prisoners with full-blown AIDS are segregated in 20 other states,
and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming inmates
for the disease.
   Federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates and
all those leaving the system. Those with AIDS or the virus are not
isolated.
   Mandatory mass screening and segregation of all HIV-positive
inmates is opposed by the National Commission on Correctional Health
Care, which sets voluntary standards for health care in prisons. It
favors solutions such as education and changing behaviors that cause
AIDS.
   Alabama inmates who tested positive to the AIDS virus have
charged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medical
care and cruel treatment. The federal trial began in March.
   Suits are pending in two other states that segregate. Inmates
with AIDS in Connecticut say their medical care is grossly
inadequate. California prisoners assert that the level of their
medical and psychiatric care is ``atrocious.''
   ``They're treated like lepers. They might as well be wearing a
scarlet letter. They're shunned, ostracized and stigmatized,'' said
Alexa Freeman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union,
which filed the Alabama suit.
   ``There is no logic, no rational basis and no medical basis to
the (segregation) policy,'' said Robert Cohen, former medical
director at New York City's Rikers Island Prison and an expert
medical witness. ``It is only fear and discrimination which gives
rise to such barbarous actions.''
   Of the 12,000 inmates in Alabama, 138 have tested positive for
HIV since 1987. All but eight are men.
   Men are segregated at the Limestone Correctional Facility inside
Dorm 7, where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yard
by a 14-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire.
   The sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it Thunder Dorm,
recalling the futuristic city in ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' a
movie about society's collapse after a nuclear holocaust.
   Inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks and
spoons. Meals come on color-coded trays. Their dirty laundry goes
out in red plastic bags so it is washed separately.
   They worship apart from other inmates and don't have equal access
to programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early parole.
   One inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind him
as he walked. Others were given surgical masks and made to clean
telephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls.
   ``The same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison,''
said Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU.
   Michael Marsh, 41, a thief, said life in Thunder Dorm features
fights, knifings and high-risk sex among prisoners who figure
they're going to die anyway.
   ``Guys would rather be killed here than die from AIDS. They
hunger for death another way. Any other way. Something that would be
honorable,'' Marsh said. ``It's like living in the valley of the
shadow of death. If AIDS don't kill you, one of the guys might.''
   Some inmates want to keep the HIV prisoners isolated, saying
those infected would be killed ``as soon as they got into the yard.''
   ``It's either we take them out or they take us out,'' said
Stewart Hughey, 28, a rapist, who testified in favor of segregation
in the Alabama case. ``If one of them gets his semen or blood on an
open cut, they just signed your death warrant.''
   In New York state, where AIDS is the leading cause of death among
inmates, medical care is deficient, according to an 18-month study
released last year by the Correctional Association of New York.
   Doctors were unfamiliar with AIDS treatment and detection, the
study said. Since 1981, more than 500 prisoners have died of AIDS;
in 25 percent of the cases, the disease was not diagnosed until an
autopsy.
   Prisoners with AIDS also have an unusually low survival rate, the
report said.
   Inmates from New York City who got the disease from dirty needles
had a mean survival rate of 159 days, half that of those in the
outside community with similar backgrounds.
   ``AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,''
said Cathy Potler, author of the report. ``Imprisonment becomes a
virtual death sentence.''

   California raisin growers heard it through the
grapevine that Ocean Spray plans to market sweetened dried
cranberries as ``Craisins,'' which they say capitalizes on the
success of their dancing raisins campaign.
   ``Why do they call it a Craisin if it's a cranberry?'' said Clyde
Nef, manager of the California Raisin Advisory Board in Fresno.
``The farmers are upset. We've spent millions of dollars in changing
the image and promoting California raisins. This appears to be an
effort to capitalize on business we've created.''
   The Craisin, a registered trademark, will be introduced this
summer in Ralston Purina Co.'s Muesli cereal, which already contains
raisins.
   It is red, slightly tart, and about the same size as a raisin.
   Ocean Spray, the Plymouth-based cooperative of cranberry growers
in Wisconsin and Massachusetts, said it will be the first time
cranberries will be used in cereal.
   The company hopes they are someday used in granola, cakes,
muffins and other foods.
   Raisin growers, who have spent nearly $8 million this year on
ads, have asked California's attorney general to look into what they
say is unfair use of the raisin name.
   ``We've spent millions of dollars building the raisin image up as
a healthy, natural fruit of the sun. Now they put a `c' in front of
it and call it a Craisin,'' said Ernest Bedrosian, president of the
National Raisin Co. in Fowler, Calif. ``We made it so popular, they
just want to shirttail on our success.''
   Ocean Spray spokesman John Lawlor disputed the raisin growers'
claims.
   ``I don't think there's any confusion here,'' he said Monday.
``It's very clear when you say Craisins are dried cranberries you're
not getting a raisin. We don't feel it's unfair. We've taken out the
trademark. It's been approved.''
   Ocean Spray, which last year grossed $781 million from cranberry
products, has steadily diversified over the years.
   Some raisin growers are convinced the Craisin won't prove to be
much competition. Raisins, they pointed out, are merely grapes dried
in the sun, while Craisins must be infused with sugar to make them
palatable.
   ``It's just the skin of the cranberry, sugar infused, and it's
very tart,'' said Pete Penner, vice chairman of the California
Raisin Advisory Board.

   He hugs a high school student as
cameras click away. A major newspaper trumpets his ``erotic aura.''
His advance man hobnobs with ``Miami Vice'' heartthrob Don Johnson
on live television.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev brought his entourage and
his charisma into Bonn on Monday, arriving amid enough hoopla for a
U.S. Super Bowl or, more appropriately, a World Cup soccer final.
   He also brought his penchant for pressing the flesh at unexpected
times. After a state banquet Gorbachev bounced from his limousine
and started shaking hands in a crowd of well-wishers along his route
to the Soviet Embassy. He was cheered with chants of ``Gorby,
Gorby!''
   The response to his first-ever visit here has so far overshadowed
the reception President Bush received when he visited West Germany
two weeks ago.
   The two main TV networks have led the way, flooding the airwaves
with hours of shows and documentaries that include everything from
interviews with Gorbachev's school teachers to a German-Russian
songfest.
   On Saturday night, the Soviet government's top spokesman appeared
on the hit TV show ``Wetten, Dass,'' a live potpourri mixing
daredevil stunts, celebrity chatter and song numbers.
   ``We should exchange jokes and not rockets,'' said Gennady I.
Gerasimov, drawing wild applause and cheers from the audience in an
auditorium in the Ruhr industrial city of Dortmund. ``We want to be
friends with your country.''
   The smiling Gerasimov, who arrived in West Germany last week to
put final touches on the trip preparations, also listened
attentively when actor Johnson joined the celebrities.
   ``We're in the same boat,'' Johnson said, shaking Gerasimov's
hand as he noted that neither speaks German.
   Gorbachev, enjoying an improved East-West climate, is looking to
West German investment and know-how to help ease a growing economic
woes at home. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government especially wants
Gorbachev's help in mending the split that divided Germany into two
nations after World War II.
   The changed climate between the old foes was obvious after
Gorbachev's arrival on Monday at the Villa Hammerschmidt, official
residence of West German President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   Smiling and relaxed, Gorbachev mingled with invited guests, some
of them ordinary West Germans. They included a group from the
Heinrich Heine classical high school in Dortmund.
   The Kremlin chief suddenly reached out and hugged Bielefeld high
school student Annette Lang, who had greeted him and his wife,
Raisa, in Russian. The young woman also gave Gorbachev a West German
pfennig and a Soviet kopeck to symbolize friendship.
   Weizsaecker gently led Gorbachev away from his enraptured fans.
   Gorbachev told the ZDF television network he had arrived with
``the best feelings'' toward West Germany.
   Later, a wedge of motorcycle police led the Soviet leader's black
limousine to Kohl's office. Gorbachev waved from the open car window
to a crowd of about 100 people, some of whom had been standing in
the afternoon sun for nearly an hour.
   According to a weekend poll conducted by ZDF, 90 percent of those
contacted said they trusted Gorbachev and his politics of reform and
disarmament.
   Gorbachev's rating surpassed that of both Bush, who received a 58
percent approval rating, and Kohl, who only received 50 percent.
   ``He Has an Enormous Erotic Aura,'' gushed a headline in Monday's
editions of the Bild Zeitung, West Germany's most widely read
newspaper.
   The newspaper, run by the arch-conservative Springer publishing
empire, added: ``The man who now fascinates Germans more than any
other head of state in the world is arriving this morning.''
   As Gorbachev began his visit, red Soviet flags fluttered along
stately Adenauer avenue, named after the iron-willed chancellor who
guided the first years of West Germany after the havoc of World War
II.
   Konrad Adenauer directed his nation toward the West. For this
week at least, the nation's attention is definitely focused on the
East.

   A week after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was
buried, his grave in a dusty field has become a golden-domed shrine
to which hundreds of thousands of Iranians a day make a mass
pilgrimage in the scorching heat.
   They travel from all over the country to keep night-long vigils
and touch the temporary monument over the grave of the octogenarian
patriarch of Iran's revolution, who is rapidly being elevated to the
pantheon of Shiite Moslem saints.
   Many believe Khomeini's blessing and protection are bestowed on
anyone who touches the square monument, fashioned from metal
shipping containers covered in green cloth and topped by the large
golden dome.
   The containers are on metal pillars and a metal grille gilded
with spray paint allows people to see the grave. Marble slabs around
it, buried under flowers, make the temporary structure resemble the
tombs of other Moslem holy men.
   ``The Imam is the greatest man in Iranian history,'' said a
teacher, who identified himself only as Mohammad and struggled with
his 6-year-old son through the mass of humanity around the shrine.
Iranians call Khomeini ``imam,'' or spiritual leader.
   ``He led the people back to our original faith, away from the
materialism of the West,'' the teacher said in fluent English. ``I
brought the boy here so he can remember this great day.''
   ``Tell the world how we loved the Imam,'' said a white-bearded
old man. He rode on the shoulders of a young man, leading chants
extolling Khomeini ``the idol smasher.''
   Around him, women wailed ``O Khomeini, our days will never be the
same without you!''
   The golden dome, sparkling in the sun by day and floodlighted by
night, has become a beacon for followers of the fierce-eyed cleric
whose fundamentalist Islamic revolution ended a 2,500-year-old
monarchy.
   All roads lead to the compound, 500 yards square, beside the huge
Behesht Zahra cemetery 10 miles south of Tehran. Khomeini was buried
there last Tuesday, three days after his death, to the accompaniment
of hysterical anguish by 2 million Iranians.
   Shiite Moslem zealots, most of them poor people who saw Khomeini
as their savior, struggle for hours through the crowds to reach the
shrine. Officials estimate more than a half million people visit the
grave every day.
   Toothless old men from the Tehran slums and cities as far away as
Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz mingle with women clad in black
head-to-toe chadors, babies clutched in their arms.
   As the waves of mourners inch closer to the grave, men beat their
heads and breasts with their hands, hoarsely chanting verses from
the Koran, Islam's holy book, and slogans of loyalty to Khomeini's
teachings.
   Some flail themselves with steel chains as drums beat slowly, a
traditional ritual during Ashura, the month of mourning for Hussein,
the first Shiite spiritual leader and founder of the sect.
   Fire engines spray water over the crowds to cool them in
temperatures that reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit under a blazing sun.
   People arrive in unending thousands in packed buses and trucks,
tractors towing trailers, in cars and on motorbikes.
   Water tankers are parked every few yards for the thirsty throngs.
Free iced lemonade and canned soft drinks are provided.
   Visitors to the grave must walk two miles through open fields
under a thick cloud of choking dust raised by the constant traffic.
The last half-mile to the square compound marked off by
10-foot-shipping containers is a nightmare of shoving and jostling.
   Revolutionary Guards in black uniforms herd women to one side of
the compound, to keep them away from the men. They wail in mourning,
their shrill lamentations drowning out the men's chants.
   Prayers chanted by mullahs, or Moslem clerics, blare from
loudspeakers and blend with the wailing and chants into a numbing
wall of sound.
   State radio and TV broadcast reports from the teeming scene
almost every hour.
   Vast crowds pressed into the area the first days after the
funeral, but no one was allowed to visit the grave until Friday,
after the compound had been enlarged and the temporary monument
erected.
   Authorities have begun a fund-raising campaign to finance a
permanent monument. Money began pouring in as soon as it was
announced.

   China's current leaders, once victims of the
Cultural Revolution, are raising fears that they may be ushering in
a new period of political chaos with their own crackdown on dissent.
   Many Chinese say they find strong similarities between the
crushing of the pro-democracy movement and the leftist ideological
purges of 1966-76, when thousands were suppressed by a campaign of
propaganda, arrests and executions.
   The government of Deng Xiaoping, who was imprisoned twice during
the Cultural Revolution, had pledged that there would never be a
return to the rhetoric and radicalism of the past.
   But his government, as part of a propaganda campaign to discredit
the protesters, has revived language not heard for more than a
decade. Phrases such as ``counterrevolutionaries'' and ``a small
band of schemers'' are reappearing in government announcements.
   The government is again making stinging criticisms of foreign
governments and media. The Voice of America, the broadcasts of which
have been jammed recently, has come in for especially tough
treatment for its coverage of the army's violent crackdown in
Beijing.
   Already, many Chinese are refusing to meet with foreign reporters
as a climate of fear spreads in the capital.
   The military, which had withdrawn from an active involvement in
the country's politics, again is playing a critical role. During the
Cultural Revolution, the military intervened often to restore order
caused by political conflicts.
   With the military's crucial assistance, the government is trying
to round up the organizers of the democratic movement.
   During the Cultural Revolution, Deng was branded one of China's
main ``capitalist roaders.'' Now he is using the techniques of his
one-time accusers to fight the pro-democracy activists.
   The first volley came in April with the publication of an
editorial that called the student movement ``chaotic turmoil'' and
urged the suppression of its leadership, described as a ``small band
of schemers.'' Chinese sources said the editorial was written on
Deng's command.
   ``It was as if I went back to the '70s,'' said an East European
diplomat, who did his first tour of duty in Beijing in the 1970s.
``The use of terms like `small band of schemers' and warning about
`chaotic turmoil' are a return to the thinking of the Cultural
Revolution. In the space of a month, China went back 10 years in
time.''
   In May, the government organized its own demonstrations to
counter the pro-democracy protests being held in Tiananmen Square.
Workers in state offices were threatened with fines if they didn't
attend, another throwback to Cultural Revolution-era practices.
Those who did attend were rewarded with bread and eggs.
   At one government rally, an effigy of China's most-famous
dissident, Fang Lizhi, was burned.
   ``The government doing that is like something like 20 years ago
(when) Mao Tse-tung sent out the Red Guard. That is dangerous,''
said Fang, who has since taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
   On June 3, the government took another page from its past when it
used violence to clear Tiananmen Square, home to thousands of
students and their protest for freedom.
   On April 5, 1976, when hundreds of thousands had gathered to
commemorate the death of Premier Chou En-lai, the police were called
out to empty the square with sticks and clubs. Many died in the
police onslaught.
   Another similarity is that Chinese have been encouraged to inform
on those who took part in the protests. In a modern twist, telephone
numbers of reporting stations were published in Beijing newspapers.
   One man, identified as a ``rumor monger,'' was reportedly turned
in two hours after his picture was broadcast on television.
   A main difference between the techniques of the Cultural
Revolution and today's struggle is that the current campaign has yet
to extend throughout the nation.
   One week into the crackdown, there are fears the worst has yet to
come.

<HEAD>OAS Mission Meets With Opposition, Government Officials</HEAD>

after talks with OAS mission. Pickup 4th pvs, ``Joao Baena ...''</HEAD>

   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma
met with military strongman Gen. Antonio Manuel Noriega Monday after
he conferred with an OAS mission trying to mediate Panama's election
deadlock.
   On its second trip to Panama, the Organization of American States
mission met separately Monday with Solis Palma and opposition party
members.
   Immediatedly after his one-hour meeting with OAS officials Solis
Palma met for another hour with Noriega. The general was seen
entering the governmental palace in civilian clothing with Carlos
Duque, the government's candidate in the May election that was
annulled.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter told reporters later
that Panamanian officials and the OAS representatives were trying to
find ``an acceptable formula'' for a dialogue between the government
and opposition.
   ``This mechanism even though it obviously doesn't exist yet .. .
this is what we are searching for,'' Ritter said.
   Noriega did not speak with reporters.
   One OAS delegate, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez,
said earlier he is confident the government and opposition have the
political will to settle their differences.
   He said it is up to the Panamanians to resolve the dispute.
   The OAS only can ``promote a dialogue and perhaps give ideas
based on our national experience based on similar situation,'' he
said.
   Joao Baena Soares, the OAS secretary-general, and the foreign
ministers of Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago are the other members
of the mission.
   Panama's political crisis began with the May 7 election, which
international observers said the opposition won by at least a 2-1
margin. The government controlled by Noriega annulled the election
and opposition candidates were attacked and beaten by his supporters.
   The OAS then agreed to send the mission to negotiate a national
dialogue on the transfer of power on Sept. 1, as required by the
constitution.
   On their first visit to Panama at the end of May, the OAS
diplomats could not persuade the opposition and government to hold
direct talks. Opposition leaders said they would talk only with
Noriega, and he refused.
   Cordovez, a former U.N. official who negotiated the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, was optimistic Monday.
   ``I think there is a political will in the government and the
opposition that has to be translated into specific steps,'' he said.
``It seems to me that it is most urgent to establish mechanisms that
allow Panamanians to talk and negotiate.''
   Noriega and government officials blame Panama's problems on the
United States, which they say wants to renege on 1977 treaties that
turn over the Panama Canal to Panama at the end of the century.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, was indicted on
drug trafficking charges last year in the United States. He denies
the charges and has refused U.S. demands he resign.

   A sightseeing plane that vanished between the
islands of Hawaii and Maui with 11 people aboard may have sent out
an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather prevented rescuers from
searching for it.
   ``There's an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it
could be the plane,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
``But the weather's so bad helicopters can't go in, and otherwise
it's about a 10-hour hike.''
   A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's
signal from the remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is
on the northwest end of the island and within the missing plane's
flight path, Spangler said.
   The valley had no vehicular access, he said, adding that no
decision had been made whether to dispatch searchers to hike in.
   ``We're getting all our information together and seeing if the
weather will let up,'' Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds
persisted in the area Monday.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane disappeared Sunday on what was
to be have been an hour-long flight.
   A Coast Guard cutter, Coast Guard helicopter and seven Civil Air
Patrol planes searched 1,279 square miles of ocean, said Coast Guard
spokesman Scott Hartvigsen. Police on Hawaii and Maui islands also
checked areas where tour aircraft fly, he said.
   Air strips also were checked in case the pilot landed without
informing the Federal Aviation Administration, said FAA spokesman
George Harvey.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft carrying a pilot and 10 tourists had
left Hilo Airport for Kahului Airport and headed up Hawaii Island's
coast under partly sunny skies, disappearing without any indication
of trouble, officials said.
   The plane's last reported position according to FAA radar was
about 10 miles north of Hilo, flying along Hawaii's northeast coast,
Hartvigsen said. Its altitude at that point was not known, Harvey
said.
   Harvey said investigators suspect that if the plane went down it
is in the area of that last radar fix, because it was passing out of
radar coverage and if it had gone further it likely would have been
picked up by another radar station.
   The sky over the area was partly sunny with low scattered clouds,
no rain and 15 to 20 mph wind at the time the plane disappeared, the
National Weather Service said. The plane took off about 1:15 p.m.
and was to have landed at Kahului at 2:30 p.m., officials said.
   Alenuihaha Channel, which the plane would have had to cross to
get to Maui, had 5- to 6-foot seas at the time.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui, Harvey said.
   The plane was on a six-island tour, said company owner Doris Tom.
The passengers had taken a ground tour of the erupting Kilauea
Volcano before leaving Hilo, she said.
   Most of those aboard are Americans and two are from Australia,
but the names are not being released because not all the families
have been notified, said David Tom, the operations manager for the
tour company.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.

<HEAD>Stolen Art Recovered Through FBI Sting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three New York art dealers set up a sting with
the FBI that led to the recovery of nine Old Master paintings stolen
from a Swiss art gallery and three arrests, according to a televised
report.
   The nine paintings, worth more than $5 million, were stolen along
with 12 other Old Masters on April 12 from the Koster Gallery in
Zurich by three men who tied up a gallery employee at gunpoint, FBI
Agent Thomas Pickard told the Art Market Report, a weekly Financial
News Network program that aired Monday night.
   The theft and arrests were disclosed for the first time on the
cable television station.
   Swiss police did not announce the theft, hoping the robbers would
try to sell the paintings if it was not publicized that they were
stolen, said Richard Schillay, one of the three art dealers who run
a gallery in Manhattan.
   A week after the theft, a man called Schillay from Paris and told
him he had an important collection he wanted to sell in the United
States.
   Schillay and his partners at the Schillay &amp; Rehs Inc. gallery,
Joseph and Howard Rehs, became suspicious when the man could not
explain why he wanted to sell the paintings here and not in Europe.
   The man also ``went through a whole grandiose story about how
important his family was. ... In our dealings here in the gallery,
we meet a number of people of wealth and virtually none of them
present themselves in this manner,'' said Schillay.
   The man also could not answer questions about the condition of
the paintings, estimated the worth of one painting at $500,000 when
it was actually worth $1.5 million, and made no inquiries about the
gallery's background, as is customary for sellers to do, the dealers
said.
   A man who claimed to be the seller's son brought the paintings to
New York and later the seller came too. Schillay &amp; Rehs had several
experts examine the paintings, and they were found to be genuine Old
Masters.
   Eventually, Schillay came across an expert who had heard of a
theft of Old Masters from a Koster Gallery. The tip led Schillay to
contact a London dealer who often invests in works at the Koster.
The London man confirmed that the paintings were stolen.
   Schillay &amp; Rehs then called the FBI. On May 1, two FBI agents
posing as employees of Schillay &amp; Rehs arrested the seller, Rene De
Grove; Thierry Houze, the man who had posed as his son; and a woman,
Martine Wins, according to Schillay.
   Pickard, the FBI agent who set up the sting, said the trio were
being held without bail in the Metropolitan Correctional Center,
awaiting indictment on charges of possession of stolen goods and
bringing stolen goods into the country.
   One of the gunmen in the heist is still at large, Schillay said.
   The other 12 paintings stolen in Zurich were not recovered, but
Schillay said De Grove was negotiating turning them over in exchange
for being transferred to a Swiss prison.
   The paintings recovered were still-lifes, landscapes, portraits
and other 17th- and 18th-century Dutch and French paintings, most of
them 7 by 9 inches or smaller, by the following artists: Jan David
De Heem, Marten Ryckaert, Jan Meartens, Jan Steen, Louise Moillou,
S. von Reysdael, Dirk Hals, Adrien Coorte and Cornelius De Heem,
Schillay said.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, calling on
skills many supposed they no longer had, battled to a 12-round draw
Monday night at Caesars Palace, almost eight years after their first
fight.
   Leonard, knocked down in both the third and 11th rounds, probably
earned the draw with a dsperation rally in the final two minutes of
the final round that had Hearns holding on.
   Leonard went down from a right to the side of the head in the
third round and three straight rights to the head put him down in
the 11th.
   Hearns was never dropped but was on wobbly legs several times and
was cut on the left cheek.
   Judge Jerry Roth of Las Vegas scored it 113-112 for Hearns and
there were loud cheers from a crowd of over 15,000. Tommy Kaczmarek
of New Jersey scored it 113-112 for Leonard and there were some boos.
   Judge Dalby Shirley of Las Vegas scored it 112-112 and Leonard
kept the World Boxing Council super middleweight title on the draw.
   Neither man appeared to be the fighter he was on Sept. 16, 1981,
when Leonard won the undisputed welterweight title by stopping
Hearns in the 14th round of a great fight.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said for the first time
Monday night that Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., is not the target
of a criminal investigation.
   The department statement backed up what Gray and his lawyer said
they have been told by FBI agents ever since word leaked out last
month that Gray had been visited by two FBI agents on Memorial Day.
   The department's statement came less than two days before a vote
in the House of Representatives for the post of majority whip, the
third-ranking leadership position among Democrats. Gray is
contending with two others for the job.
   ``Congressman Gray is not the target of a criminal investigation
by the Department of Justice. Congressman Gray and his office have
been fully cooperating with the Department of Justice and the FBI,''
said a statement read by spokesman Dan Eramian.
   The spokesman said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had
authorized his executive assistant, Robert S. Ross Jr., to make the
statement.
   Eramian declined to answer questions on why the statement was
issued Monday night.
   Government sources, speaking earlier on condition that they not
be identified, said the department had opened a preliminary
investigation into whether Gray had a ``no-show'' employee on his
staff.
   Gray said from the outset he knew of no such employees, and
members of his staff have said since that they had found no evidence
of one.
   In a statement issued Monday after the department's, Gray said:
``I have said from the beginning that I am not a target and this
confirms it. I have said from the beginning that I and my staff have
cooperated full and this confirms it. I have done nothing wrong and
this too will be confirmed.''
   Jon Plebani, Gray's chief of staff, said he had been told that
the Justice Department decided to issue the statement because
reports about the investigation of Gray's office ``have done
Congressman Gray a serious disservice and have inappropriately been
a factor'' in the Whip contest.

<HEAD>Film Director Richard Quine Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Quine, who directed Jack Lemmon in a
variety of oddball comedies including ``How to Murder Your Wife,''
committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, police said
Monday. He was 68.
   Quine died Saturday night at the University of California, Los
Angeles Medical Center, said Sgt. Jerry Schlotthauer of the West Los
Angeles Division station. He said that Quine had been despondent for
years over poor health.
   An actor's son, Quine was born Nov. 12, 1920 in Detroit, Mich.
The vaudeville performer made his movie debut when he was 12.
   As an actor, his work was confined to supporting roles in films
such as Jane Eyre in 1934 and ``Command Decision'' with Clark Gable
in 1948. He made the transition to directing.
   He directed movies including ``Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder,''
which he also co-wrote, in 1952; did the 1954 remake of ``So This Is
Paris'' starring Tony Curtis and Gloria DeHaven; the 1965 film ``The
Solid Gold Cadillac,'' narrated by George Burns; and the 1964 comedy
``Sex and the Single Girl,'' with a cast that included Natalie Wood,
Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda.
   William Holden starred in Quine's 1960 film, ``The World of Suzie
Wong.''
   Quine became a journeyman at comedy direction, working with Jimmy
Stewart, Kim Novak and Lemmon in 1958's ``Bell, Book and Candle,''
from a successful Broadway play about a New Yorker who discovers
he's in love with the witch in the apartment next door.
   In 1959, he directed Lemmon and Doris Day in ``It Happened to
Jane.''
   He also directed Ernie Kovacs with Lemmon in the 1957 comedy
``Operation Mad Ball'' and went on to work with Miss Novak, Kovacs
and Kirk Douglas in ``Strangers When We Meet,'' a sultry melodrama
about changing mores in the postwar suburbs.

   Former Olympic ice skater Tai Babilonia says she
is ready to return to the rink, nine months after a suicide attempt
during a time she ``hit rock bottom.''
   Miss Babilonia posed with her skating partner Randy Gardner in
Times Square on Monday to announce their professional return
Wednesday at a show in Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``I'm excited about being back with my partner andscared to death
about performing again,'' said Miss Babilonia. ``But it was my
decision to come back. I missed it.''
   Nine months ago, Miss Babilonia, 29, tried to kill herself by
taking an overdose of sleeping pills.
   Miss Babilonia, who has been skating since she was 7 years old,
said she was ``burnt out'' on skating. ``I had taken on too much,
more work than I can handle, and that just sort of caught up with
me,'' she said.
   Miss Babilonia and Gardner won the world figure skating title in
Vienna, Austria, in 1979. The pair had to drop out of the 1980
Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., when Gardner suffered a
leg injury.

   Pop superstar Michael Jackson will be

receives a baby giraffe.
   Sedgwick County Zoo officials said Monday a 1-year-old giraffe
named Mahali was set to leave Wednesday for California, where an
animal dealer will deliver her to Jackson.
   Zookeeper Ryan Gulker said she isn't a typical giraffe, which may
suit Jackson just fine because she's on the shy side.
   ``She's not as outgoing as some of the other giraffes that we've
had,'' Gulker said. ``She seems to be a little bit more to herself.''
   Zoo officials would not disclose Mahali's price, but said female
giraffes normally run about $15,000.

serve champagne and boutique beer.
   Brenner said the chain of billiards rooms, bearing his name, also

   ``Some people have old-fashioned connotations of 1950s
poolrooms,'' he said. ``But this is going to be the social meeting
place for yuppies.''
   If he didn't mean it, he said, ``I would have just called it the

   Brenner, who grew up in Philadelphia and lives in New York, said
he hopes to open the first parlor by October in the historic Society

   Country music singer Ricky Van Shelton
canceled his appearance with the Statler Brothers at an annual
Fourth of July concert because a cover could not be rigged for the
stage, the entertainers said.
   The Statler Brothers said Monday that Shelton ``made elaborate
and expensive demands that we are not willing to provide'' for the
20th Happy Birthday USA Celebration.
   Shelton said in a statement he canceled because of a personal
policy not to accept any bookings that did not provide a cover for
the stage.
   ``Mr. Shelton believes that he cannot deliver the caliber
performance his fans expect of him in a rain downpour or with an
extreme sun beating down on him,'' the statement said.
   Earlier this year, Shelton won male vocalist of the year, single
of the year and favorite music video awards from the Music City News
Country Awards.
   The Happy Birthday U.S.A. committee, which runs the event, said a
stage cover would interfere with an American flag that is used in
the Statler Brothers' finale, Shelton's statement said.

by performing the Heimlich maneuver.
   After attending a baby shower for her Sunday, Ms. Tucker and
several friends went to a Nashville area restaurant. During their

turning blue.
   ``We were eating steak,'' said Ms. Tucker. ``All of a sudden she
took a bite and (began coughing). I asked her, ``Are you choking?''
   Despite her pregnancy, Ms. Tucker reached her friend from behind
and dislodge the food with a quick thrust to her abdomen.
   Ms. Tucker, 30, said her brother, John, taught her the Heimlich
maneuver after he used it to dislodge aspirin stuck in her throat
prior to a concert performance several years ago.

   Fighting between Christian and Syrian
forces has paralyzed the American University of Beirut, the Middle
East's most prestigious academic institute, and much of the rest of
Lebanon's educational system.
   But senior university officials are bent on reopening as soon as
they can the seaside facility that has given the Arab world at least
three presidents, 10 prime ministers and more than 100 Cabinet
ministers and ambassadors.
   Acting President Ibrahim Salti contends the university will
resume classes 48 hours after the latest round of fighting stops in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Since fierce artillery battles broke out March 8, thirty-three
shells from Christian east Beirut have hit the campus of the
123-year-old American University, causing damage estimated at
$600,000.
   Salti, a Jordanian, insisted in an interview: ``AUB is still
healthy despite its unhealthy environment.''
   The university was founded in 1866 by Daniel Bliss, a Protestant
missionary from New England. It was chartered under the laws of New
York state.
   Classes were suspended March 23, one month into the final 1989
semester, when the artillery battles broke out.
   The campus drew Christian artillery fire after the Syrians set up
gun positions near the university. Despite a shaky cease-fire
declared by the Arab League on May 11, Syrian gunners, including
those near the university, daily shell Christian ports to stop
supplies reaching their foes.
   The only reported university casualty among the 363 people killed
and more than 1,400 wounded was Alice Haddad, 60, a Lebanese
librarian killed by shrapnel April 16 as she walked to the medical
library.
   Many of the 80 red-roofed stone buildings around the 73-acre
campus are pocked with shell splinters.
   Most of the 5,300 Arab, Asian and African students have gone.
   The medical school, with 268 students, remained functioning
throughout the fighting. Its hospital, the largest in Lebanon with
421 beds, treated 60 casualties an hour during the worst of the
shelling.
   Students at the university and at other colleges who had hoped to
graduate and head abroad to study in the United States and western
Europe have been forced to take shelter in bunkers rather than take
exams vital to careers.
   Khaled Abdel Samad, director of student affairs at the Education
Ministry, said more than 200,000 students were unable to take final
tests for their high school diploma because of the fighting.
   Abed el-Naser Arayissin, 26, a computer science student at the
U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College hoping to study in the
United States, hoped to finish school by the end of summer.
   ``But because of what's happened, I'll have to do another year
making up for the one I've lost because of the civil war.''
   In New York, AUB's American president, Dr. Frederick P. Herter,
said recently: ``We're prepared to extend the current semester into
the summer in order to complete all necessary academic
requirements.''
   No one is sure when the AUB will reopen.
   Herter, a 68-year-old surgeon, has not been to the university
since he was named president in March 1987.
   Lebanon is off-limits for Americans because of the wave of
assassinations and kidnappings that engulfed the university, the
first to introduce American education into the Middle East and a
target for anti-Western Moslem fundamentalists.
   The university founder's grandson, AUB president David Dodge,
became the first of many kidnap victims in 1982. He appeared in
Damascus, the Syrian capital, a year later.
   His successor, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated by a gunman outside
his office on Jan. 18, 1984.
   Soon after, the campus was swept by a wave of abductions. Among
those kidnapped was American librarian Peter Kilburn, seized Dec. 1,
1984, and political science professor Leigh Douglas, a Briton,
kidnapped March 28, 1986.
   Their bodies, along with that of another kidnapped British
educator, were found April 18, 1986, three days after U.S. air raids
on Libya.
   Two other kidnapped AUB officials _ acting dean of agriculture
Thomas Sutherland and acting comptroller Joseph Cicippio _ are among
nine Americans still in captivity.
   Education Ministry officials say that if AUB stays closed, so
will Beirut's 17 other universities in Moslem and Christian sectors
and most of the country's 3,000 schools, which have a combined
enrollment of more than 800,000.
   ``We can't run the risk of resuming classes under repeated
shelling threats and have our students get killed on campus,'' said
Elias Maroun, a Beirut schools official.
   Schools and colleges in north and south Lebanon, untouched by the
fighting, have remained open.

   Children, grownups, even the monkeys and apes
stare up at sculptor Steven Weitzman as he transforms a 28-foot tree
stump at the National Zoo into a mirror of the exotic life around
him.
   Using chainsaw, drill, mallets and chisels from his scaffolding,
Weitzman is sculpting a tribute to zoo volunteers from the barren
trunk of a nearly century-old willow oak that was chopped down last
year because it was dying. He found the stump lying abandoned near a
creek in the zoo.
   Weitzman, 36, a native of Boulder, Colo., who came to Washington
by way of Los Angeles, has been working since last August to convert
the trunk into a work of art honoring those who ``maintain our
extended family _ the flora and fauna of the planet.''
   He already has inhabited the upper reaches of the stump with a
miniature zoo. Among the carved figures are a swooping American bald
eagle, a scowling orangutan, a contented panda, great blue heron,
water lizard, tree shrew, fish, squirrel and a giraffe nibbling
greenery offered by the outstretched hand of a young man.
   ``Can you find the tree frog?'' Weitzman asks passersby. (It's
crawling out of its hole just below the black palm cockatoo.)
   Operating on a $20,000 commission from the National Zoo and its
volunteer organization, Friends of the National Zoo, Weitzman works
almost daily _ except when it rains _ in the hope of finishing his
sculpture by the end of October.
   His studio is a fenced-in plot on the sun-drenched lawn facing
the zoo's reptile and monkey houses. The tourists swarming below
aren't simply gawkers. Weitzman occasionally invites someone to
mount the scaffolding to model an ear or nose for the human figure
he is carving.
   Early on, Weitzman got some helpful kibitzing from a denizen of
the zoo's nearby monkey island.
   ``I was trying to carve an eagle but the tree was saying, no,
this won't work,'' he said. ``I wrestled with it for two or three
days, cussing at myself, but it was not becoming an eagle. It just
got worse and worse.
   ``Then I had the feeling something was watching me. I looked over
my shoulder and there was a Barbary ape sitting over there with his
hands on his knees, staring at me. So I forgot the eagle and carved
him looking back at himself.''
   With a friendly eyes and a smile as wide as his mustache,
Weitzman encourages his spectators to step forward, grab a chisel
and make their own artistic imprint.
   ``One of my aims is to dispel the illusion that artists are a
unique branch of humanity, to show the public that creating a piece
of art work is not beyond most people's ability,'' he said.
   ``People say, aw, you're so lucky. I wish I could carve like
that. I say, come up here, confront your fears and I'll show you how
to do it.
   ``Three hours later, they're still carving. They say, `Wow, I can
do it','' Weitzman says.
   ``It's all about pursuing your dreams. My dream is to do this
sculpture out of a five-ton tree stump. Yours might be singing,
dancing, writing, painting, crocheting. Everyone has something to
communicate. What it takes is tenacity... pursuing it with all of
your heart.
   ``If you work your butt off, if you work really hard, you can do
it. Maybe it won't be the best in the world, but so what?''

   Virginians vote today in a Republican
primary to choose an opponent for L. Douglas Wilder, the Democratic
nominee seeking to making history as the nation's first elected
black governor.
   Polls show a deadlock in the GOP contest among former U.S. Sen.
Paul S. Trible Jr., former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman and
U.S. Rep. Stanford E. Parris. Today's primary is the first GOP
gubernatorial primary in the state since 1949.
   Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, was nominated Saturday
at a unified state Democratic convention. He and his running mates,
businessman Donald S. Beyer Jr. for lieutenant governor and Mary Sue
Terry for re-election as attorney general, launched a statewide tour
Monday.
   All 2.6 million registered voters can participate in the primary
because Virginia does not have registration by party, but turnout in
the Super Tuesday presidential primary in March 1988 was only
235,000 on the GOP side.
   Trible, 42, had led all polls until last week. But two surveys
published as Coleman turned 47 on Thursday put him about even with
Trible. Parris, 59, was was close enough to the leaders to fall
within the polls' sampling errors.
   A poll released last week showed each of the three GOP contenders
leading Wilder, but only slightly. Wilder, 58, is nurturing his
image as an underdog, a tactic which helped parlay him into the
lieutenant governorship in 1985.
   A grandson of slaves, Wilder grew up in segregated Richmond and
attended Howard University Law School in Washington on a state
stipend because he could not go to Virginia's all-white law schools.
   He has portrayed himself as a social moderate and fiscal
conservative and has played down the racial aspect of the contest,
as have the three GOP contenders.
   The nation has not had a black governor since Reconstruction and
has never actually elected one. Lt. Gov. Pinckney Pinchback of
Louisiana became acting governor in 1872-73 after Gov. Henry
Warmouth was removed from office.

<HEAD>Wife of Ethics Chairman Makes Big Profit on Small Investment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The wife of House ethics committee chairman
Julian Dixon earned over $150,000 in two years from an investment of
less than $15,000 in companies that help run stores at Los Angeles
International Airport.
   Airport officials are looking into the two companies to determine
whether they qualified properly as minority contractors. Although
they had identical boards of directors, one was listed as a minority
enterprise while another was listed as being run by women.
   On Monday, Dixon amended his 1986 financial disclosure form to
show that his wife, Betty, paid between $5,000 and $15,000 for the
investment in the companies.
   Dixon, D-Calif., initially told The Associated Press he did not
have to reveal how much Mrs. Dixon paid for the high-yield
investment because she owned no stock in the California companies,
Mir Kanon Inc. and Peideau Inc.
   But he told the House clerk in a letter Monday that ``upon recent
review'' of the companies' articles of incorporation ``it appears
that, technically, Betty is deemed a stockholder.''
   ``In this light, her acquisition of interest in Mir Kanon-Peideau
in July 1986 also should have been reflected in the transaction
section,'' Dixon said.
   He said in a telephone interview he was ``sorry that I made that
mistake'' of not disclosing the cost of the investment. ``Obviously
I feel badly about it.''
   Dixon's forms from 1986 showed that Mrs. Dixon's investment was
worth between $100,000 and $250,000. Thus, the investment appears to
have soared after she paid between $5,000 and $15,000 for it in July
1986.
   Mrs. Dixon invested in Mir Kanon and Peideau three months after
the companies were part of a joint venture awarded the concession to
run duty-free stores at the world's third-busiest airport.
   Dixon, who gained prominence in presiding over the ethics
committee probe that ended with the resignation of Speaker Jim
Wright, said in a telephone interview that the California investment
has been ``better than we ever expected.''
   Mrs. Dixon received dividends of over $100,000 in 1988 and of
between $50,000 and $100,000 in 1987, according to financial forms
disclosed for those years.
   Dixon said there was nothing improper about his wife's business
arrangement and that she was the ``ideal person'' to sit on the
companies' boards because she has a background in retailing. Her
Washington business, ``Much Ado About Something Inc.,'' distributes
advertising novelties.
   As a member of both companies' boards, Mrs. Dixon said she
attends meetings and helps set corporate policy. ``I don't have a
job there, not a 9-to-5 job,'' she said.
   Los Angeles airport officials are checking to see if the
companies meet requirements to qualify as minority contractors.
   Glenn Kroh, the airport's property manager, said he has uncovered
nothing ``illegal or immoral'' about the multimillion-dollar
concession business.
   Donald Miller, the airport's deputy executive director, said
officials ``want to make sure they are a bona fide minority business
enterprise and women's business enterprise.''
   When airport commissioners awarded the duty-free concession,
Miller said, Mir Kanon was classified as a minority enterprise,
while Peideau was classified as a business run by women.
   But California records show the companies had identical boards of
directors on Sept. 28, 1988. They also had the same agent, who
listed the same address in Culver City, Calif.
   ``That is not the way it was proposed to us originally,'' Miller
said.
   However, he said airport officials knew from the beginning there
was overlapping ownership in Mir Kanon and Peideau, in that
prominent Atlanta businessmen Jesse Hill Jr., president of Atlanta
Life Insurance Inc.; Herman J. Russell, a contractor; and Felker
Ward, an attorney, own part of the businesses.
   Dixon, who also a member of the House Appropriations Committee,
said his wife's high-yield investment has never affected his
decisions in Congress.
   ``I'm sure I've supported bills that have supported the
airport,'' said Dixon, whose congressional district abuts the
airport. ``I don't recall any specific requests that I've made to
members, nor have I contacted the Federal Aviation Administration.''
   Dixon's revision came as the finances of congressional spouses
are in the spotlight because of Wright's resignation after being
charged with 69 violations by the House ethics committee. The
committee contended that Wright's wife received improper gifts from
a wealthy businessman, a charge Wright denied.
   Last week, Dixon initially declined to disclose how much his wife
paid for her investment, saying she didn't own stock in the
California companies.
   House ethics rules permit members to amend their financial
disclosure statements if a change is made in a timely fashion after
new information is brought to a lawmaker's attention.
   In 1988, Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd., the majority partner in
the duty-free concession, accumulated gross revenues of $78 million
from the airport shops, airport officials said.
   Mir Kanon and Peideau have 32 percent of the business in a joint
venture with Duty Free Shoppers to run the duty-free stores, airport
officials said. The companies also are part of the concession for
gift and news stores.

   President Raul Alfonsin said
Monday night he will resign on June 30, nearly six months before the
scheduled transfer of power, but President-elect Carlos Menem said
that's too soon.
   Menem and his Peronist Party defeated Alfonsin's centrist Radical
Civic Union bloc in May 14 national elections and the inauguration
of the new president and congressional winners was scheduled for
Dec. 10.
   Alfonsin, 62, said in a 15-minute broadcast to the nation that
Argentina's disastrous economy forced his resignation. Interest
rates and unemployment have approached record levels and at least 11
people were killed late last month in food riots and looting.
   ``I have decided to resign effective June 30, 1989, the post of
president of Argentina,'' Alfonsin said.
   Vice President Victor Martinez also will resign on June 30, he
said.
   Two hours after Alfonsin's address, Menem issued a statement
saying it was ``impossible'' for him to take office on June 30, and
criticized the ``unilateral'' decision by Alfonsin.
   The statement, read by the news secretary of La Rioja province,
Adrian Freijo, said Menem ``had no alternative'' but to allow the
Senate president, Eduardo Menem, to act as interim president, as
called for in the constitution.
   Carlos Menem, 58, is governor of La Rioja. Eduardo Menem is his
brother.
   Earlier, Alfonsin representative Rodolfo Terragno told reporters
in Buenos Aires that Menem said he would take over in August at the
earliest.
   Menem had said in a radio interview earlier in the day that June
30 ``seemed to me to be too fast'' to take over.
   In his speech Alfonsin said the accord he sent to Menem ``until
now ... only has my signature.''
   He said the document includes his pledge to support the Peronist
economic program, help renegotiate the foreign debt, and cooperate
in investigating any alleged wrongdoing by his administration.
   Earlier, Interior Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese announced the
Electoral College will convene June 21, more than seven weeks ahead
of schedule, to confirm Menem's presidency.
   Alfonsin could not run for re-election under the constitution,
and his party's presidential nominee, Eduardo Angeloz, was defeated
by Menem.
   In an interview Monday, Cesar Jaroslavsky, president of the
Radical Civic Union deputies in Congress, said the final obstacles
to a hand-over were worked out in weekend talks with the Peronists.
   ``It's just not possible to govern the country under these
circumstances,'' Jaroslavsky said. ``There is no other mechanism
than to speed up the transfer of power.''
   The two parties apparently resolved that Congress, which in 1983
set Dec. 10 as the transition date, will set the new date, and that
Radical legislators will support Peronist legislative projects.
   Similar talks were cut short three weeks ago because they could
not agree how to stabilize Argentina's economy. Alfonsin wanted to
raise rates for public services to balance the budget. Menem
rejected that as ``anti-popular.''
   Menem wants the new Congress to take office the same day he does
because Peronists won virtual control of both houses in the May 14
balloting.
   Peronists reportedly are considering issuing a new currency to
replace the devalued austral; setting a high exchange rate to spur
exports and curtail imports, and granting big wage increases to ease
social tensions and generate demand.
   A final stumbling block appears to be an issue that has stymied
Alfonsin since his Dec. 10, 1983, inauguration: trials of officers
accused of human rights violations during the 1976-83 military
regime's ``dirty war'' on leftists.
   At least 8,961 Argentines vanished after being arrested by
security forces and are presumed executed, according to a commission
appointed by Alfonsin. Human rights groups say the actual number may
be two or three times as high.
   Menem clearly wants Alfonsin to settle the issue by ending the
trials. Alfonsin had half a dozen officers prosecuted and then
cleared hundreds of others.

   They've toured his house, marveled at the
gold records and jeweled jumpsuits and checked out his lavish
airplanes. And now, for the Elvis fans who thought they'd seen it
all, there's more.
   ``It's Elvis and America and the automobile,'' says Todd Morgan,
a spokesman for the Elvis Presley Automobile Museum, which opened
Monday. ``It's Elvis' love affair with cars and America's love
affair with cars.''
   The museum has more than 20 vehicles once owned by the king of
rock 'n' roll and is the newest attraction at the 46,000-square-foot
souvenir shopping center at Graceland, Presley's former Memphis
residence.
   More than 650,000 tourists and fans visited Graceland last year.
For a $15.95 see-it-all ticket, fans can tour the house, two of
Presley's airplanes, his tour bus, a couple of small museums and the
new 13,000-square-foot automobile display. It costs $3.50 for the
automobile museum alone.
   The $1.5 million automobile museum, which includes replicas of a
drive-in movie and a 1950s filling station, features vehicles
ranging from a go-cart to Presley's favorite Stutz Bearcat.
   Many of the vehicles were kept until last year under a backyard
carport at Graceland, and they had fallen into serious disrepair,
said Brian Hughes of Classic Car Co. of Memphis.
   Even the 1955 pink Cadillac that Presley gave his mother was in
rough shape, said Hughes, whose company restored the vehicles for
the museum. Like many of the display vehicles, the Caddy had to be
stripped to its frame and rebuilt, he said.
   However, much of the machinery inside the vehicles is still in
mint condition. ``If you raised the hood, the engine is just like
the day Presley gave it to his mother,'' Hughes said.
   The museum includes TV screens beside several of the vehicles
showing home movies of Presley or his family.
   A short film of Presley movie clips showing him with various
vehicles is featured at the drive-in movie set at the center of the
museum. For seating, the set has 38 front seats from 1957 Chevrolets.
   Graceland is operated for the financial benefit of Presley's only
child, Lisa Marie, 21, who will inherit the house and tourist
complex at age 25. She has agreed to leave the operation with its
current management at least until she is 30.
   Last year the complex took in $12 million, up from $9 million two
years ago, said Jack Soden, general manager of the Graceland
Division of Elvis Presley Enterprises.
   Presley died of heart disease in 1977 and Graceland soon became a
mecca for the Elvis faithful. The fans were barred from the house
until 1982 when the Presley estate hired Soden and other
professionals to take advantage of Graceland's potential as a
tourist attraction.
   Soden said he expects Graceland's business to keep growing,
including plans to join outside investors to open an Elvis museum in
England. Managers of the Presley estate also expect to take part in
a music museum to be built in downtown Memphis.

   Former tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood
has pleaded innocent to state charges of criminal mischief leveled
after the Exxon Valdez rammed a reef, triggering this nation's worst
oil spill.
   If convicted of the three felony counts of second-degree criminal
mischief, Hazelwood could face up to 15 years in jail and $150,000
in fines. He entered his plea Monday in Superior Court.
   Officials on Monday also announced the Exxon Shipping Co.'s Exxon
Valdez would be towed to San Diego for more than $25 million in
repairs.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., has already pleaded innocent
to misdemeanor charges of operating a ship while intoxicated,
reckless endangerment and negligent pollution. He remains free on
$50,000 bail.
   The felony case was scheduled for trial before Superior Court
Judge John Bosshard in Valdez on June 20, the same day Hazelwood is
to go on trial on the misdemeanor charges before Bosshard.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef early March 24, pouring nearly
11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   Before the accident, Hazelwood had turned over control of the
987-foot ship to the third mate. Nearly 11 hours after the accident,
the captain had an illegally high blood-alcohol content, the Coast
Guard said.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Dick Madson of Fairbanks, said he would try
to have the trials consolidated and moved to Fairbanks. ``I don't
think the state wants the cost and inconvenience of two trials any
more than we do,'' he said.
   Madson said his client had flown in from New York for the
arraignment and would return almost immediately. Hazelwood now
fishes for lobsters commercially there, Madson said.
   In San Diego, National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. and Exxon
officials announced an agreement to repair the Exxon Valdez at
National Steel and Shipbuilding's shipyards there.
   National Steel and Shipbuilding built the ship.
   The tanker will be towed from a protected bay in the sound after
the Coast Guard gives permission, Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik
said in Valdez.
   Exxon Corp. has thousands of workers laboring to remove oil from
beaches in Prince William Sound. The company estimates it has spent
more than $200 million so far in the effort.

   President Bush has redefined the debate in
Congress over clean air and taken a leap forward in convincing
environmentalists that while he may not be one of them, he's not the
enemy either.
   To many environmentalists, the significance of Bush's
three-pronged proposal Monday to clean up the nation's dirtiest air
is that it came forcefully from the White House along with a clear
acknowledgement by the president that air pollution is putting
millions of Americans at risk.
   This is in sharp contrast to the eight years President Reagan
occupied the White House. Reagan did not acknowledge acid rain as
being an environmental concern and viewed tougher laws to curb urban
smog and toxic industrial chemicals as excessive government
regulation.
   With Republicans in Congress rallying around the Bush clean air
package ``the political chemistry is going to change dramatically''
and the debate will center on finding a middle ground between the
White House bill and more stringent Democratic versions, said Jay
Hair, president of the Wildlife Federation.
   ``The Republicans are now going to be in the bidding game on
environmental issues,'' agreed Fred Krupp, executive director of the
Environmental Defense Fund. He said the Bush package will serve as
``a vehicle that's going to drive this (issue) through Congress.''
   ``We no longer need to debate what the goals will be,'' suggested
Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association. David Gardiner, legislative director of the Sierra
Club, said the Bush proposal ``will definitely break the logjam.''
   That is not to say the power picture in Congress has not also
changed significantly from the Reagan years and likely will be just
as important.
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, sponsor of an acid rain bill last
year, is now Senate majority leader. He succeeded Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., who for years has been a staunch opponent of any
legislation that might harm the high-sulfur coal industry in his
state.
   Public opinion polls also have told Congress and the president
that the voters are keenly interested in removing the yellowish smog
from urban areas, want to be protected against the release of toxic
industrial chemicals into the air, and approve of curbs on acid rain
which is destroying lakes, streams and forests hundreds of miles
from the tall stacks of coal-burning power plants.
   Such is the mood that Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, who in the past has blocked clean air
legislation opposed by the auto industry, responded to the Bush
package by saying ``the broad outlines appear reasonable.''
   To be sure, there are provisions and details of Bush's clean air
package that brought criticism and uncertainty from the
environmental community. At the same time it was characterized as
trying to move too far, too fast by the coal industry.
   Despite those industry complaints, Bush's proposal to cut sulfur
dioxide emissions from coal burning power plants in half by the year
2000 _ a key to curtailing acid rain _ prompted widespread praise.
   It was more than many environmentalists had expected.
   ``The president basically sided with those in the administration
who wanted a stronger proposal,'' said George Frampton of the
Wilderness Society, alluding to reports of sharp disagreement among
some Bush advisers over details of package.
   So, while environmentalists continue to chide Bush for his slow
response to the Alaska oil spill tragedy and criticize him for a
handful of mid-level appointments involving public lands and parks,
they also suggest that there is growing evidence his commitment to
protecting the environment may not be purely rhetoric.
   They see the Bush clean air proposal as the clearest sign of that
so far.
   ``I believe the environment won today,'' a beaming William K.
Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told reporters
after briefing them on the White House proposal.

   President Bush has won praise for proposing the
clean air package his predecessor wouldn't touch, but he faces
division over provisions on acid rain, airborne toxic chemicals and
auto emissions.
   ``I think he got an A for effort,'' Richard Ayres, chairman of
the National Clean Air Coalition, said Monday after Bush announced
his proposal. ``He's heading in the right direction.''
   Ayres' reaction was typical of the praise that flowed from
environmentalists, industry spokesmen and lawmakers. Viewing Bush's
proposals as generally positive, they nonetheless took issue with
particulars.
   Ayres, for example, said he was concerned the plan put too much
emphasis on new, cleaner fuels rather than cleaning pollution from
existing gasoline engines.
   Much criticism also came from groups with vested financial
interests, who said Bush went too far. The coal industry and
officials from mining states, for instance, predicted utility
customers would pay for the switch to low-sulfur coal.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell summed up the remarks of
many when he called Bush's plan ``a significant departure from the
negative environmental policy of the Reagan administration, which
opposed every clean-air bill considered by Congress for the past
eight years.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, was chief sponsor of the major clean air bill
last year, and his elevation to majority leader this year has led to
numerous predictions of an end to a decade-long congressional
gridlock.
   Bush alluded as well to the previous inertia.
   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and political
paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution,'' he
said. ``We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time to clear the
air.''
   The proposal would attempt to leave most cities free of urban
smog by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce acid rain pollution.
   Bush recommended that automakers be required to build and sell
methanol-powered cars in nine urban areas plagued by dirty air. He
proposed that limits on tailpipe emissions of ozone-producing
hydrocarbons in existing cars be tightened by almost 40 percent.
   A proposed 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide from
coal-burning power plants, a major cause of acid rain, would mean a
50 percent cut in these deadly emissions.
   And Bush said industry should be required to use new technology
to curb the release of cancer-causing toxic chemicals into the air.
   The most critical voices came from the National Coal Association
and Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd said the acid rain provisions
would unfairly penalize the high-sulfur coal areas like his state
``by leading to massive switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur
coal.''
   Richard L. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association,
called some provisions ``unnecessary, unduly harsh and economically
onerous'' and warned that ``electric ratepayers will likely pay more
for electricity.''
   Bush Chief of Staff John Sununu said the stiffer standards would
add 5 percent to 10 percent to utility rates in 18 states that burn
high sulfur coal and contribute the most to the acid rain problem.
But he said their rates would still fall below the national average.
   The Clean Air Working Group, representing 1,950 companies and
associations, said it recognized ``the innovative, positive ideals''
in Bush's plan.
   But the group said the alternative motor vehicle fuels plan was
excessive, and agreed with the coal industry that utilities _ under
the Bush plan _ would be unwilling to spend money on new, clean coal
technology.
   The technology would not achieve results until 2005, according to
the coal industry, too late to meet the year 2000 deadline for
reducing sulfur dioxide.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called the Bush plan ``a welcome
departure'' from the Reagan administration's lack of action, but
added: ``I do not think the proposal goes far enough in ... controls
on mobile sources (motor vehicles), which are the single largest
source of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution.
   ``The tailpipe emission standards in force today are standards
established in the Clear Air Act of 1970.''
   But Tim MacCarthy, director of federal liaison of the Motor
Vehicle Manufacturers Assocation, including the Big Three U.S.
carmakers, said ``we don't support'' tougher tailpipe emissions
standards.
   He said the retirement of older cars, increased emissions
inspection and maintenance programs and pilot projects on
alternative fuels are a much better idea.
   But he said ``there is a very good likelihood there will be some
tightening of tailpipe standards.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the chief sponsor of clean air
legislation in the Senate this year, said, ``The rhetoric is good,
but it's a bit vague in the urban smog provisions.''
   David Gardiner, of the Sierra Club, called the air toxics part of
the bill ``the weakest'' portion of the proposal. He said industry
would not have to use the best possible technology to reduce toxic
emissions, and predicted the Bush standards ``will not make a dent''
in the problem.
   William Reilly, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said cleaning the air ``will neither be free nor easy.'' For
example, electric bills are expected to increase by 2 percent in
some states to clean up coal-fired electric plants.
   At a briefing before Bush's speech, Reilly estimated the overall
program would cost between $14 billion and $19 billion a year after
it is in full effect at the turn of the century.

   Donald Gregg has been assured he's not a target
for possible prosecution in the Iran-Contra affair, a State
Department official says, but Gregg's appointment as ambassador to
South Korea still faces an uphill climb in the Senate.
   ``The administration has no interest is appointing as ambassadors
individuals who are the targets of grand jury investigations,'' the
State Department's chief legal adviser, Abraham D. Sofaer, said in a
letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``Mr. Gregg would withdraw from consideration if his conduct was
so regarded by a federal prosecutor,'' said the letter, made
available Monday. ``This has never been the case, however, and it is
not so today.''
   The committee has delayed Gregg's confirmation while it
investigates allegations that while serving as Vice President Bush's
national security adviser in the Reagan administration Gregg helped
in the illegal resupply of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who has spearheaded the committee's
investigation of Gregg, has said he finds Gregg's firm denials of
such activity ``hard to accept.''
   Sofaer said Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh told Gregg that
he was a ``subject'' of the Iran-Contra investigation being
conducted by Walsh but ``not a target.''
   The United States Attorney's Manual describes a subject as ``a
person whose conduct is within the scope of a grand jury's
investigation,'' Sofaer said.
   A ``target'' is described as a ``person to whom a prosecutor or
the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him@her to the
commission of a crime.''
   ``Under longstanding practice, a `target' who is a witness before
a grand jury is warned that his `conduct is being investigated for
possible violation of federal criminal law,''' Sofaer said.
   ``When Mr. Gregg testified before the grand jury he was informed
that he was not a target, and was not told that his conduct was
being investigated for possible violation of federal criminal law,''
he said.
   Speculation that the grand jury might be preparing to indict
Gregg on perjury charges stemmed from Walsh's noncommittal reply
when asked by Cranston whether Gregg was a target of the Iran-Contra
probe.
   In that reply, dated June 1, Walsh said it is accurate that the
investigation ``extends to perjury and false statements before the
Iran-Contra hearings'' as evidenced by the indictment of retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.
   Walsh said his office had made no statement about Gregg and was
``unable to comment further at this time.''
   Under an agreement between Cranston and Republican members of the
committee, who contend Gregg is being subjected to an unfair ordeal
of ``delay and leaks,'' Gregg will be questioned under oath at a
second investigative hearing on Thursday.
   Cranston has said he will permit the full committee to vote on
the Gregg nomination on June 20.

   Reporters roundly criticized an effort by
columnist Jack Anderson to test security at the Capitol by smuggling
in a gun, an action that could also lead to criminal charges and
revocation of his media pass.
   ``This was Jack Anderson making a quick buck,'' Bob Franken of
Cable News Network said Monday. He called Anderson's action a
``trivialization'' of journalism.
   Al Freeman of Mutual Broadcasting called Anderson's technique ``a
stunt.''
   Freeman said someone such as Anderson, a nationally syndicated
columnist, is known and might have an easier time getting into the
Capitol without as thorough a check as lesser-known individuals.
   But Anderson said Monday that he did not carry the gun into the
building himself because he realized there was a possibility he
would be recognized and therefore not checked as carefully as a
person not known to security officers.
   He said the accomplice who carried the weapon was with his party
but ``went in far enough ahead of me I don't think that person would
have been associated with me.'' The accomplice was not named.
   Franken praised the Capitol police for carrying out the difficult
task of providing security while allowing people access to their
elected representatives.
   ``Those are opposing philosophies,'' said Officer Dan Nichols,
spokesman for the Capitol Police. The building draws 20,000 visitors
daily, he said.
   Nichols said police and the U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia are investigating whether to file criminal charges against
Anderson in connection with the May 24 incident.
   Anderson pulled the pistol out of his pocket while taping an
interview about terrorism with Sen. Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., in the senator's office.
   The columnist could be charged with possession of a gun inside
the Capitol, a felony punishable by a $5,000 fine, five years in
jail or both. Lesser charges also are being considered, Nichols said.
   Additionally, the committee that hands out media credentials is
considering revoking Anderson's privileges.
   ``For us, the issue is narrow: Did he abuse his position as a
reporter?'' said Wall Street Journal reporter Jeffrey Birnbaum,
chairman of the committee which credentials about 2,000 daily print
journalists.
   He said the five-member committee could take away Andrson's
credentials, reprimand him or do nothing after a hearing that has
not yet been scheduled.
   In an informal survey, reporters who cover Congress regularly
expressed nearly unanimous displeasure for Anderson's act.
   Kenan Block, a producer for MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, said he did
a similar story on airport security when he was reporting for a
local station.
   ``It's a cheap shot,'' he said. ``It's kind of a cliche. I
thought Anderson would do a more sophisticated story.''
   Senate Mjority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Dole have
threatened to require more time-consuming searches of the media if
the credentials committee doesn't ``deter any future repetition of
this act.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken
the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis to heart, changing his
government to reduce chances of a superpower confrontation, say U.S.
veterans of the incident.
   Over the past two years, Gorbachev has authorized disclosure of
reams of new information on the 1962 crisis, said Raymond Garthoff,
a former U.S. diplomat who played a role in the crisis and has
written a book on it.
   At a seminar on his book, Garthoff said the Soviets have decided
the crisis stemmed from a decision reached by then-Soviet leader
Nikita S. Khrushchev to send nuclear missiles to Cuba without
adequate consultation with other members of the Politburo.
   ``Like the Afghan invasion, it is seen as an error caused by
having too few people involved in a decision,'' said Garthoff, who
revised an earlier book on the basis of new Soviet disclosures.
Garthoff is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution.
   The decision to invade Afghanistan in December 1979 was made by
then-Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev and a handful of Politburo
members, according to other Soviet disclosures. The Soviets withdrew
their forces from Afghanistan this year.
   Robert McNamara, who was the American defense secretary during
the Cuban missile crisis, said Gorbachev's close attention to the
incident shows his ``sensitivity to the dangers'' that nuclear
weapons pose.
   Garthoff and McNamara interpreted many of the reforms proposed by
Gorbachev, such as enhancing the presidency, giving more power to
the Soviet parliament and publishing reports on meetings of the
ruling Politburo, as efforts to expand the number of people involved
in decision-making.
   McNamara, like Garthoff, has taken part in a series of
U.S.-Soviet meetings on the missile crisis, including one in Moscow
last January attended by Andrei Gromyko, who was foreign minister at
the time of the crisis, and by Anatoly Dobrynin, who was the Soviet
ambassador to Washington at the time.
   Dobrynin angered U.S. officials during the crisis by telling them
that there were no Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.
   Dobrynin assured participants at the conference in Moscow last
January that he had not known about the missiles and Gromyko
confirmed that, according to McNamara, who also took part in the
seminar.
   Gromyko leaned across the conference table, cracking a rare
smile, and said: ``I thought I told you on the way to the airport.''
   ``No, you didn't,'' Dobrynin replied, according to McNamara.
   U.S. officials at the time had aerial photographs showing launch
pads for Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles, capable of reaching the
United States, but could not confirm that the warheads had been sent
to Cuba.
   Recent Soviet disclosures have revealed that 20 nuclear warheads
were in Cuba, and that 20 more were en route aboard the Poltava, a
Soviet freighter turned back by the naval quarantine that President
John F. Kennedy ordered around the Caribbean island during the
crisis, according to Garthoff.
   Recent Soviet disclosures have unraveled many mysteries of the
missile crisis, including the decision to down a U.S. U-2 spy plane
over Cuba at the height of the crisis, said Garthoff.
   Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, chief of the Soviet Institute of
Military History, told Garthoff in an interview that the decision
was made by two Soviet generals in Cuba and was not cleared by their
superiors.
   The downing of the American spy plane caused Khrushchev ``shock
and dismay,'' Grathoff said Soviets told him recently.
   Although Soviet officials have been speaking more openly of the
crisis, said Garthoff, they have not yet declassified any internal
documents from that era, in contrast to the American government,
which has released thousands of pages of such material.
   Among the disclosures from the declassified U.S. material was
that U.S. fighters sent to rescue another U-2 that wandered
inadvertently over Soviet territory were armed with nuclear-tipped
Genie anti-aircraft missiles, said Garthoff and McNamara.
   The presence of the Genie missiles was disclosed previously in a
book by Scott Sagan, ``Moving Targets,'' also based largely on
declassified U.S. documents.

<HEAD>Fang Lizhi Latest to Take Refuge in an Embassy; Some Have Stayed
for Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS KENT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty hid out for 15 years at the
U.S. Embassy in Budapest. Ten-thousand Cubans once sought refuge on
the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy. Now, Chinese dissident Fang
Lizhi is holed up in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   All have taken advantage of the right of foreign embassies, long
secured in diplomatic law, to grant protection to dissidents and
defectors from the countries where they are located.
   Sometimes, an embassy's granting of refuge can provide an easy
way out for everyone in a political conflict. Foreign missions have
been used as a convenient conduit, especially in Latin America, to
quickly get toppled leaders and their relatives out of the country
after a revolution.
   But far more often, the granting of embassy refuge to opponents
of the host government aggravates diplomatic tension. It can also
put a heavy burden on the mission doing the sheltering.
   China's leaders on Tuesday showed their anger at the U.S.
decision to grant refuge to Fang, calling it an interference in
internal affairs. They ordered a nationwide alert for Fang, telling
local authorities to arrest him if he is seen trying to escape the
country.
   Under international law, embassies are the territory of the
country they represent, not territory of the host country.
Therefore, a dissident or defector who makes it to a foreign embassy
is usually safe from pursuit, if the embassy takes him in.
   The embassy has no ability, however, to guarantee the
refuge-seeker safe passage out of the host country.
   In many cases, embassies that have supported a dissident feel a
moral obligation to help him when he gets into trouble.
   ``Oftentimes, these people will go into an embassy where they
have friends, and it's because of these friends and associations
that they're being pursued in the first place,'' said Peter Tarnoff,
the president of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations and
a former State Department official.
   Tarnoff said in an interview that despite the dislocation that
the practice sometimes causes for embassies, most diplomats believe
the right to grant refuge is a useful diplomatic privilege.
   That includes nations of all ideologies, said Charles M.
Lichenstein, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and now
a fellow of the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington.
   ``The most established totalitarianisms, like the Soviet Union,
to the best of my knowledge respect these principles,'' Lichenstein
said in an interview. Dictatorships, he said, tend to claim that
their own dissidents or defectors who take advantage of embassy
refuge are in fact common criminals, not political activists.
   Perhaps the longest-running modern case of embassy asylum was
that of Mindszenty, who was arrested by Hungary's communist rulers
in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to life in prison.
   Hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising, but
Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S. mission in Budapest after Warsaw
Pact forces crushed the revolt. He lived there until the Vatican
arranged for his release to the West in 1971.
   Many embassy refuge cases have involved the East bloc. In the
Soviet Union, seven Pentecostalists claiming religious persecution
lived for five years in a cramped room at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow, leaving in 1983.
   In the freer atmosphere now prevailing inside the East bloc, it
has even become possible now for citizens of one bloc country to
seek asylum from another.
   Latin America has seen many instances of foreign embassies or
diplomats helping to evacuate losers in political struggles. When
Juan D. Peron was overthrown in Argentina in 1955, he took a boat to
Paraguay under Paraguayan government protection.
   In 1973, after Salvador Allende was overthrown as president of
Chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace, his widow and
her children received refuge in the Mexican Embassy in Santiago. The
Mexican government then flew them out of the country.
   The largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy
at once may have been in Cuba in April 1980, when 10,000 Cubans
entered the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate.
Cuban authorities eventually persuaded the crowd to go home, but
eventually almost all of them received exit visas.
   And in South Africa, some 20 prisoners and anti-apartheid
activists have taken refuge in the U.S., British, West German and
Dutch diplomatic missions in recent years. Most were eventually
allowed to go free, with South African government assurances that
they would not be punished.

<HEAD>Court Ruling a Setback to Victims' Rights Advocates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The victims' rights movement, despite achieving
some recent legislative success, has suffered a Supreme Court
setback for the second time in two years.
   The high court, by a 5-4 vote, ruled Monday that a jury choosing
between the death penalty and a life prison term for a convicted
murderer generally may not be told about the victim's personal
characteristics.
   The justices said a South Carolina murderer unfairly was
sentenced to death because a prosecutor told jurors the victim was a
religious, community-minded person.
   Also Monday, in another 5-4 decision, the court gave white men
significant new power to challenge court-approved affirmative action
plans, even years after they take effect.
   The court said white Birmingham, Ala., firefighters are entitled
to a day in court to try to prove an affirmative action program for
hiring and promoting blacks makes them the victims of unlawful
reverse racial bias.
   In contrast, the court on Monday killed, by a 5-3 vote, a
sex-discrimination lawsuit by three women who work at an AT&amp;T plant
in Illinois, ruling they had waited too long to challenge seniority
system changes.
   Writing for the court in the capital sentencing case, Justice
William J. Brennan said the jury's life-or-death decision cannot be
based on factors of which the defendant was unaware.
   His opinion relied heavily on the court's 1987 decision in which
``victim impact statements'' were barred from sentencing trials in
which the death penalty is one possibility.
   The Maryland Legislature had passed a law requiring sentencing
courts in murder cases to allow members of the victim's family to
testify about the crime's impact on their lives. Other state
legislatures had passed similar measures.
   The court's four dissenters in the South Carolina case said
Monday they are ready to overturn the 1987 decision.
   But Justice Byron R. White, a dissenter in the 1987 case, sided
with Brennan and provided the decisive vote.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens completed the court's majority.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
   Demetrious Gathers was convicted of a 1986 killing in a
Charleston, S.C., city park. He killed Richard Haynes, 32, during an
attack in which Haynes was beaten and stabbed.
   At Gathers' sentencing trial, a state prosecutor focused on
Hayne's characteristics. The prosecutor, in his closing argument,
told jurors that among the things found at the murder scene were
various religious items and a voter registration card belonging to
Haynes.
   ``We know from the proof that ... Haynes was a religious person
... (he) believed in this community. He took part,'' the prosecutor
said.
   The South Carolina Supreme Court said those statements deprived
Gathers of a fair sentencing trial, and Monday's decision upheld
that ruling.
   ``The content of the various papers the victim happened to be
carrying when he was attacked was purely fortuitous, and cannot
provide any information relevant to the defendant's moral
culpability,'' Brennan wrote.

   ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' were a winning combination in
the weekend box office sweepstakes, claiming first and second place
in ticket sales.
   The Star Trek movie grossed $17.4 million at the nation's
theaters and Indiana Jones attracted another $16 million in its
third week, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Paramount's ``Star Trek V,'' directed by and starring William
Shatner, enjoyed the best opening weekend of any of the previous
``Star Trek'' movie adaptations.
   The studio's latest installment of Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana
Jones,'' surpassed the $100 million mark, making the Harrison Ford
comedy-adventure the fastest movie to pass the threshold.
   The summer movie season will enter full swing within the next
three weeks: ``Ghostbusters II'' opens on Friday, ``Batman'' arrives
on June 23 and ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and
``Karate Kid III'' will debut on June 30.
   In its first week of wide release, Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets
Society'' sold $7.5 million of tickets to finish in third place. In
fourth place was the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder crime comedy ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with receipts of $3.4 million.
   The Kevin Costner baseball film ``Field of Dreams'' landed in
fifth on grosses of $3.1 million. It was followed by the Hulk Hogan
wrestling film ``No Holds Barred'' falling to sixth place with a
gate of $2.9 million. ``Road House,'' with Patrick Swayze as a bar
bouncer, was seventh with $2.2 million.
   ``Renegades,'' a police movie starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou
Diamond Phillips, finished in eighth with grosses of $1.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary'' in ninth with $1.5
million and ``K-9'' in 10th with $1.4 million. Clint Eastwood's
clunker ``Pink Cadillac'' dropped out of the Top 10, as did ``Major
League.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $17.4 million,
2,202 screens, $7,890 per screen, $17.4 million, one week.
   2. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $16
million, 2,327 screens, $6,894 per screen, $102.8 million, three
weeks.
   3. ``Dead Poets Society,'' Disney, $7.54 million, 687 screens,
$10,976 per screen, $8.1 million, two weeks.

   Monday's twin earthquakes may have
startled downtown workers, but it didn't surprise Oscar the fish.
   The eight-inch-long swimming seismograph was spotted swimming on
his side in a classroom aquarium, three hours before a quake
registering 4.5 on the Richter scale hit, said Ron Schnitger, a
biology teacher at Corona del Mar High School, who serves as Oscar's
keeper and interpreter.
   Oscar has done the same before 15 to 20 other quakes, Schnitger
said.
   ``He just swims on his side about six inches below the surface,''
he said.
   The quake was centered under Montebello some 25 miles away and
was hardly strong enough to slosh the water in Oscar's 140-gallon
tank. The quake and a subsequent 4.3-magnitude temblor were
moderate, causing only minor damage and injuring one person.
   Schnitger said the freshwater fish was a South American red
Oscar. The fish is missing one eye, but Schnitger and other
believers said his cockeyed swimming doesn't have anything to do
with trying to see better.
   ``It's nothing special for an individual fish to behave
strangely'' before an earthquake, said John Fish, who works at the
Aquarium Stock Co. pet store in West Los Angeles.
   So what does Oscar think the future holds for quake-wary
Californians?
   ``He's upright, so we don't have to worry about it any more,''
Schnitger said.

<HEAD>Winter Wheat Crop Estimated at 11-Year Low Because of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A further decline in this year's wheat
prospects is prompting renewed calls for federal drought aid to
hard-hit farming areas that have not yet recovered from the 1988
burn-out.
   The Agriculture Department says farmers are harvesting a winter
wheat crop estimated at an 11-year low of 1.41 billion bushels, down
10 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent below the May
forecast.
   Based on June 1 surveys, the latest estimate announced Monday
compares with last month's forecast of 1.43 billion bushels and the
1988 winter wheat harvest of 1.56 billion bushels.
   The next estimate will be July 12.
   Officials said the average yield, based on June 1 conditions, was
estimated at 34.5 bushels per acre, compared with 34.9 bushels per
acre estimated in May and last year's per acre average of 39.2
bushels.
   Farmers are expected to have about 40.8 million acres for harvest
this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million acres in 1988, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report.
   ``Once again, we see evidence of a significant shortfall in the
wheat crop on an expanded area,'' said Carl Schwensen, executive
vice president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. ``The
outlook is not likely to improve from this point onward.''
   Winter wheat, planted in the fall and harvested the next summer,
makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat production. The
remainder is planted in the spring.
   Next month's crop report will include production estimates for
spring-planted wheat, thus providing the first 1989 look at total
U.S. wheat output.
   The first estimates of 1989 output of corn, soybeans, cotton and
other major crops will be issued Aug. 10.
   Lingering drought and late-season freezes crippled much of the
winter wheat crop in parts of the Great Plains, notably in Kansas
where this year's harvest was estimated at 202.4 million bushels.
That was unchanged from May indications, but far below last year's
harvest of 323 million bushels.
   The continuing effects of drought in Kansas and some other states
have stirred demands for federal aid comparable to the $3.9 billion
emergency measure passed by Congress last year to help cover 1988
losses.
   Legislation has been introduced to expand 1989 drought
assistance, but the administration has opposed any massive
rapid-fire remedies until more is known about the crop situation.
   Schwensen said the June winter wheat report ``highlights once
again the need for federal disaster legislation.''
   The skimpy wheat outlook is not expected to have a major impact
on the price of bread or other food products, according to USDA
economists.
   Overall, they expect consumer food prices to increase an average
of 5 percent to 7 percent in 1989, compared with last year's average
gain of 4.1 percent. Higher vegetable prices stemming from severe
winter cold and lingering effects of last year's drought are major
factors.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, USDA projected total 1989
wheat production _ a figure based on assumptions of normal weather
and trend yields _ at about 2.03 billion bushels, up from last
year's 1.81 billion bushels. That was down slightly from the May
projection.
   The report showed that wheat prices could rise to an average of
$3.80 per bushel to $4.20 per bushel in 1989-90, from $3.74 per
bushel in the wheat marketing year that ended May 31.
   With higher prices ahead, wheat exports could decline to 1.15
billion bushels, from 1.44 billion bushels in 1988-89, the report
said. The U.S. wheat stockpile June 1, 1990, would be down to about
500 million bushels from 616 million bushels on hand this June 1.

   Farmers have contracted with the government to
take an additional 2.46 million acres of highly erodible cropland
from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program.
   The additional acres were enrolled during the program's eighth
round of signups held Feb. 6-24, the Agriculture Department said
Monday. The next will be July 17 through Aug. 4.
   Keith Bjerke, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said the total contracted
under the CRP is nearly 30.6 million acres.
   Bjerke said the total now exceeds the 28.7 million acres that was
in the 1960 Soil Bank program, making the CRP ``the largest
long-term cropland retirement program in U.S. history.''
   Under the program, farmers agree to take their land from
production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit,
farmers who are accepted get annual rental payments from the
government and one-time assistance to pay for half the cost of
planting trees, shrubs and grass to guard against erosion.
   Average annual rental payments have been running close to $50 per
acre.
   The goal set by Congress in the 1985 farm law is to have 40
million to 45 million acres in the program by 1990.

   The Agriculture Department says the outlook
continues favorable for a bumper grain harvest in the Soviet Union
this year.
   Total grain production was estimated at 210 million metric tons,
unchanged from the previous forecast, the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service said Monday in a monthly report.
   Production at 210 million tons, up from 195.1 million tons last
year, would include 91.5 million tons of wheat, 105.5 million tons
of coarse grains such as corn and barley, and 13 million tons of
miscellaneous grains.
   Soviet grain imports were projected at 33 million tons for the
trade year that will begin on July 1, unchanged from the earlier
forecast.

<HEAD>Deal Would Have Made $500 Million for Backers of Failed US Nuke Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration last month approved the
sale of nuclear power plant equipment to China that would have
allowed backers of a canceled U.S. plant to recoup $500 million, but
later rescinded the license after protests from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   Two weeks after issuing an export license for the sale, the
Commerce Department rescinded it following complaints from the NRC
and a Senate committee chairman who said the deal violated a 1985
congressional resolution on nuclear non-proliferation, officials
said Monday.
   The primary beneficiary of the sale would have been holders of
$2.25 billion in bonds now held in trust by the Chemical Bank of New
York, according to the officials. The bonds were declared in default
after a Washington Public Power Supply System plant near Olympia,
Wash., was canceled in 1982.
   ``We viewed it initially as an attempt to circumvent the law,''
said Leonard Weiss, staff director of the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs. ``We discovered the State Department wasn't
even aware of this export.''
   The committee's chairman, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, complained in
a letter to Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher that the shipment
would ``undercut'' a 1985 congressional ban on such sales unless the
president first certified that China is not helping other countries
build nuclear weapons.
   Glenn has been a frequent critic of what he says is China's
clandestine trade in nuclear-related materials with Third World
countries, particularly Pakistan and Middle East nations.
   Weiss said Commerce Department officials originally contended
that a non-proliferation declaration from Bush was not needed
because the export license was only for non-reactor components.
   However, he said Mosbacher later informed Glenn that the deal was
being deferred pending consultation with the NRC.
   All of the events took place before the Chinese government's
crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing.
   The proposed sale stems from cancellation of nuclear power plants
in 1982 by the Washington Public Power Supply System and 88
participating local utilities in the Pacific Northwest.
   The cancellation of the plant 45 miles west of Olympia, at
Satsop, Wash., and another at Hanford, Wash., touched off the
biggest bond default in U.S. history and scores of suits by
bondholders.
   Last fall, a tentative settlement was reached in which WPPSS and
the local utilities agreed to pay bondholders roughly 20 cents on
every dollar they invested in the two plants.
   Gary Petersen, a WPPSS spokesman, said the settlement _ which has
yet to be approved by a federal judge on Phoenix, Ariz. _ also
called for the bondholders to receive any proceeds from sale of the
unfinished plants' equipment and other assets.
   ``There's no direct benefit to the supply system other than we're
the custodian for selling the plants' assets for the best return of
the bondholders,'' he said.
   Harold Denton, director of governmental and public affairs for
the NRC, said his agency protested the sale because neither the
White House has not certified to Congress that China ``is a
full-fledged member of the non-proliferation club.''
   In addition to the export license for non-nuclear components of
the Satsop plant, WPPSS also has sought permission from the NRC and
State Department to sell its atomic reactor and 250,000 pounds of
enriched uranium fuel to China.
   The NRC rejected those license requests earlier this year because
of the lack of a certification of China's non-proliferation status
from the president, Denton said.
   Among those lobbying for the export licenses were WPPSS; Chemical
Bank as the bondholders' trustee; the plant's designer, EBASCO
Services of New York, and Combustion Engineering Corp., the supplier
of the plant's reactor, officials said.
   While the NRC is in charge of licensing export licenses for
reactors and nuclear fuel, the Commerce Department has export
licensing authority for all non-nuclear electric power plant
components.
   However, such licenses are not normally approved by either agency
until after interagency consultations among the NRC, the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency and the State, Commerce and Energy
departments.
   He said the Commerce Department license was issued in early May
``without consulting with us'' but withdrawn two weeks later ``after
we found out about it.''
   ``It sounds to me like it was an oversight on their part, because
normally they do consult with us,'' Denton said. ``In this case,
they didn't. They've corrected that.''
   Since then, he said, the Commerce Department has agreed to
condition any license for the export of non-nuclear components on
NRC approval of a reactor sale.
   Both of those events, he said, are contingent upon certification
by the State Department and the White House that the sales would
pose no risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Stiff Penalties for Jenrette in Shoplifting Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury that convicted former congressman
John Jenrette of shoplifting says he should pay a heavy price for
the necktie and shoes he stole from a suburban Washington department
store.
   Jenrette was found guilty Monday of stealing the items and
switching price tags on two pieces of clothing. The Fairfax County
Circuit Court jury deliberated only 35 minutes before convicting the
former lawmaker of the two misdemeanor charges.
   The jurors recommended six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for
each of the two violations. Sentencing was set for Aug. 18.
   The 53-year-old former congressman from South Carolina served 13
months in prison and is still on probation for bribery and
conspiracy convictions in the Abscam scandal.
   ``This could trigger three years extra in prison,'' Jenrette's
attorney, Steve Merril, said. ``He has his entire life left to lose.
He's going back to the penitentiary and he's losing any chance to
practice law again.''
   Upon hearing the verdict, Jenrette stared straight ahead and
showed little emotion. He left the courtroom through a back exit to
avoid talking to reporters.
   ``It's a tremendous setback to his life,'' Merril said. ``It
appeared that he had put his troubles behind him. Now, he's got
major problems.''
   Jenrette had been found guilty of the charges by a Fairfax County
Circuit judge on Feb. 23. He appealed that verdict in order to bring
his case before a jury, where he felt he could succeed in
establishing reasonable doubt.
   But the jury ended up believing the testimony of two security
guards at Marshall's discount department store in Tyson's Corner,
Va. Heather McKeever and John Brown told jurors they viewed
Jenrette's every move through the zoom lens of a security camera
last Dec. 7.
   Ms. McKeever said she saw Jenrette put on a pair of store shoes
and place his own in the bottom row of the store's shoe rack.
   Ms. McKeever said Jenrette also pocketed a tie and replaced the
price tags on a pair of pants and a shirt with tags he removed from
lower priced merchandise.
   Jenrette paid $14 for items valued at $80. The tie retailed at
$17.99 and the shoes were $39.99. When he was apprehended, the
former lawmaker had $139 and several credit cards in his pockets.
   ``He said he was sorry and asked if there was anything he could
do for me personally,'' Ms. McKeever testified.
   Merril built his case around the fact that the camera did not
tape the incident, so there was no physical evidence that Jenrette
switched the labels. He also questioned the accuracy of the camera,
and asked jurors to note that Jenrette left behind a $125 pair of
shoes.
   Jenrette testified that the tie was his own. He said he brought
it into the store to compare it with one he was thinking of buying,
and Rosemary Long, Jenrette's self-described girlfriend, backed him
up by saying she saw the tie in his car trunk a week before the
incident.
   As for the shoes, Jenrette's excuse was absent-mindedness.
   ``I flat forgot it,'' he said. ``I had them on for 35-40 minutes,
and embarrassingly forgot I had them on.''
   Merril told jurors in his closing argument that a conviction
based upon the evidence provided would be ``a disgrace.''
   Prosecutor William Pickett chose to attack Jenrette's defense,
calling it ``totally fiction.''
   ``This defendant, for some perverted pleasure, went in and stole
those items,'' Pickett said. ``It's hard to imagine a more clear-cut
case.''
   Jenrette, a Democrat who served in Congress from 1975 to 1980,
was sentenced to two years in prison and five years probation after
his conviction in the Abscam sting operation in which FBI agents
posing as Arab sheiks and businessmen offered bribes to lawmakers.
   ``It will take an awfully strong person to come back from this,''
Merril said.

<HEAD>Mock Awards Given to `Most Misleading Ads'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the advertising industry preened to receive
its annual awards for excellence, consumer groups issued mock awards
of their own for the year's ``most misleading, unfair or
irresponsible ad campaigns.''
   Balancing the industry's coveted ``Clio'' awards, given Monday
night in New York, the consumer groups issued their Harlan Page
Hubbard awards, named for a pioneer advertiser of patent medicines
that were supposed to cure whatever ailed you.
   The ``winners'' of Hubbards, should they choose to accept them,
are entitled to a bronze-colored victory figure grasping a lemon.
The results were announced Monday by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest.
   The U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a previous ``Hubbard''
recipient, was singled out ``for claiming that nuclear power can
reduce oil imports when, in fact, most oil is used for gasoline for
which nuclear power cannot substitute.''
   Carl Goldstein, spokesman for the group, said, ``we don't pay a
whole lot of attention to things like this.'' He said the
advertising claims ``are responsible and verifiable'' and should be
judged ``by what responsible people think about it.''
   TWA was cited for advertising a $298 round-trip fare to London,
including hotel and car, ``when the actual cost of the trip ranges
from more than $700 to $1,400,'' according to the CSPI.
   ``TWA is no longer running the ads and have no further comment
regarding the award,'' said Donald Morrison, a spokesman for the
airline.
   Anheuser-Busch was cited for beer commercials featuring a dog
named Spuds MacKenzie. The CSPI said the commercials appeal to
people under the legal drinking age and associate drinking with
athletics.
   ``As a responsible corporation, we are satisfied that neither the
Spuds MacKenzie advertisements nor our other brand commercials
promote underage consumption,'' said Michael J. Roarty, an executive
vice president of Anheuser-Busch. ``Our commercials are placed only
in programming in which the majority of viewers are above the legal
minimum age to consume beer.''
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, selected for similar reasons, did
not respond to a request for comment from public relations spokesman
David Fischel.
   The CSPI also gave ``Hubbards'' to Ohio Art Co. Inc., of Bryan,
Ohio, ``for implying that its `Zaks' toy could operate on its own
power when a child must move the toy''; and to National Benefit Life
Insurance, ``for claiming that a life insurance policy with `big
dollar benefits' could be purchased for $3.95 a month when the
policy provided as little as $1,000 worth of coverage.''
   Pat Grandy, advertising manager for Ohio Art, described the toy
as being like a puppet _ ``the creatures you can build have mouths
that move, ears that wiggle; a puppet moves because someone moves
it.''
   A call to the life insurance firm, which uses big-name, older
actors in its commercials, was not returned.
   Mercedes-Benz, spotlighted ``for encouraging reckless high-speed
driving at 125 mph,'' said it was surprised that such inferences
were drawn from the advertisement at issue.
   ``There's nothing reckless or irresponsible in the ad,'' said
A.B. Shuman, manager of public relations for the company. ``It shows
the car is capable of driving in its native country at those speeds
and the indication is there's a tremendous reserve of handling,
comfort and safety in the United States at our speed limits.''
   Bain de Soleil was chosen for the award ``for promoting
high-priced products containing a sunscreen rating from 20 to 30
when the highest meaningful degree of protection most consumers can
benefit from is a sunscreen rating of 15.''
   Not so, said Debra Bennets, the company's director of
communications. ``We take issue with their assumption. ... Many
dermatologists view a skin protection factor of 15 as a minimum and
not a maximum level protection that's needed.''
   She said the Skin Cancer Foundation, the American Cancer Society
and the National Institutes of Health have within the last year
recommended daily use of sunscreens with a rating of 15 or higher.
   However, a consensus panel organized by NIH last month concluded
that ``there was no evidence'' that a protection factor above 15
provided any additional protection.
   The National Pork Producers Council was selected for ``claiming
that pork is nutritionally equivalent to chicken even though most
cuts of pork are higher in saturated fat and cholesterol than
chicken.''
   ``That's not true,'' said Charles Harness, a spokesman for the
pork producers. ``Pork centerloin broiled contains 8.9 grams fat per
3-ounce serving. Compare the same thing to a chicken thigh, skin on
and roasted. That's 13 grams of fat.''
   Thompson Medical Company Inc., makers of Dexatrim diet pills, was
chosen for advertising ``the non-prescription drug would not cause
nervousness or irritability even though the active ingredient in the
product is a recognized stimulant.''
   Said Kelly Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the company, ``we sweepingly
reject the charge and we believe that the charge itself is
misleading. The active ingredient in Dexatrim is not a stimulant and
does not make you nervous when taken in recommended doses.''

   Rep. William H. Gray III is not the target of a
criminal investigation, the Justice Department said in a statement
issued less than two days before a House leadership election in
which the Pennsylvania Democrat is a candidate.
   Gray, a candidate for majority whip, said the department's
statement Monday proved his earlier accounts that he was not
targeted in a preliminary investigation that government sources have
said involves allegations of a ``no-show'' employee on his staff.
   ``Congressman Gray is not the target of a criminal investigation
by the Department of Justice,'' the department said in the statement
issued Monday night. ``Congressman Gray and his office have been
fully cooperating with the Department of Justice and the FBI.''
   Department spokesman Dan Eramian said Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh authorized his executive assistant, Robert S. Ross Jr.,
to make the statement. Eramian declined to answer questions on why
the statement was issued Monday night.
   Gray's top aide, Jon Plebani, said he had been told the
department issued the statement because officials there believed
news leaks about the investigation had done Gray a ``serious
disservice'' and possibly had influenced the whip contest. Gray,
currently chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is one of three
candidates for the post.
   Gray, in a statement, said: ``I have said from the beginning that
I am not a target and this confirms it. I have said from the
beginning that I and my staff have cooperated fully and this
confirms it. I have done nothing wrong and this too will be
confirmed.''
   Plebani said an internal review by Gray's staff had left the
congressman's staff ``convinced, based on our exhaustive checking
into every employee who worked for Bill Gray, that we've never had a
non-performing employee.''
   Word of the investigation surfaced after Gray met with FBI agents
on Memorial Day at a Washington hotel. Gray and other congressmen,
including House Republican leader Robert Michel, complained to
Thornburgh about the leaks and the attorney general has ordered an
aide to investigate their source.

   A plea for pennies to build a new

   Metta Lyons, co-chairman of a committee to build the Randolph
Community Playground, said donors have pitched in $10,000 worth of
pennies since the drive began Friday. The group hopes to raise
$55,000.
   ``They came with buckets, jars and bags,'' she said. ``One lady

   The group plans to hire a firm to design the playground, then get
local volunteers to build it.
   ``The Federal Reserve Bank should be happy to get all these

   Two Chinese diplomats, who denounced their
government after the Beijing massacre, remained in hiding today to
study their options after declining to ask for political asylum.
   The young consulate officers, the first Chinese diplomats to
defect to the United States since the Communist Revolution in 1949,
met for several hours Monday with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   ``They haven't requested anything,'' said David Ilchert, INS
regional director. ``They are not in INS custody and told us they do
not wish to make any statement to the press. They're mulling over
the options and may wish to seek legal counsel.''
   Meanwhile, China's consul general in San Francisco issued a brief
statement calling the defections ``utterly unjustifiable,'' and said
China is ``making representations'' to the United States regarding
the case.
   The defectors are worried about giving up their homeland and
careers but didn't appear to be worried about violent reprisals
against them, said FBI agent Richard Held.
   He said the consulate officers, who are at an undisclosed site in
the San Francisco Bay area, are not in FBI protective custody.
   One of their options is to simply remain in the United States for
another year, under the visa extension granted to all Chinese
nationals last week by the Bush administration.
   Zhou Li-min, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, told the
Chinese Times in San Francisco in an interview published Monday that
he has supported the students cause ``in his heart'' since the start
of the student protests in Beijing.
   Zhang Li-ming, 25, vice consul for overseas affairs, said the two
planned for several days to defect and decided to announce it at a
candlelight vigil planned outside City Hall.
   At the vigil, which was attended by about 5,000 people, they told
the stunned rally they decided to defect after Beijing leaders
launched a propaganda campaign claiming no citizens had died in the
clash in and around Tiananmen Square on June 4.
   ``We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed.
Why? Because we are diplomats. But we won't fake it here. Before we
are diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings,'' Zhang said.
   The Chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly
soldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence said
the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   The State Department's historian's office in Washington reported
that Zhao and Zhang are the first such official Chinese seeking
asylum in the United States since the revolution.

   Poland may now start trying for a loan from the
International Monetary Fund, a State Department official told
Congress.
   William Bodde Jr., assistant secretary of state for Europe, also
said Monday the administration would support loans from the
International Finance Corp., the part of the World Bank that lends
to private enterprise. The corporation has already made some loans
to Poland, but other and larger sections of the bank have not.
   The bank and the fund are twin bodies owned by 151 countries,
with headquarters in Washington. The United States has great
influence in both but only about 19 percent of the voting power.
President Bush said in April that the United States would support a
fund loan to Poland and take other initiatives to help the country.
   Bodde said that while Bush was speaking about Poland, much of
what he said could also apply to Hungary.
   ``We are working on this,'' Bodde added.

   Four finalists have been chosen in the
competition to design a memorial to women in military service.
   The ultimate winner is to be chosen in November, and the memorial
is to be built with private funds with ground breaking by 1991. It
is to be located at the memorial gate of Arlington National
Cemetery, which was left unfinished during the Depression.
   A grove of bronze trees designed by Teresa Norton of Tybee
Island, Ga., and associates Cleve Harp, David Overholt, Sergio
Chavarria, Peter S. Christman, Martha Enzmann and Ming T. Shaing was
designed to symbolize a guard of sentries.
   The design by Gregory A. Galford and Maria L. Antonis of
Philadelphia includes a spiraling ramp recessed into the four-acre
site in front of the Arlington gate. It also would include rooms
dedicated to women's role in each of America's wars, and a platform
overlooking the cemetery and the grave of John F. Kennedy.
   The entry by Michael A. Manfredi of New York and associates
Marion G. Weiss, Ellen D. Sands and Thomas Schumacher of Washington
would involve 10 clear glass prisms, illuminating exhibits telling
the story of women in the military.
   A fourth entry by Stephen D. Siegle and Margaret Derwent of
Chicago was made an additional finalist, although its designers did
not share in the $10,000 prizes awarded to the other three teams.
The Chicago design calls for building an educational-cultural center.

   More American wetlands could be saved through
tax breaks and other incentives than through regulations, according
to a group of senators.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly
and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, chairman of the National Wetlands
Policy Forum, met Monday with nine senators to discuss strategies
for stemming the loss of America's shrinking wetlands.
   ``The administration previously thought it would confine itself
to executive orders,'' said Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. ``You do
better with incentives,'' he said after the meeting.
   ``You get a lot more with a carrot than a stick,'' Kean said of
the incentive approach that might be offered to farmers, developers
and private landowners to encourage actions that would help protect,
if not increase, swamps, estuaries and other water-soaked land that
protects wildlife, cleans waterways and helps regulate streamflow.
   More than 50 percent of tidal wetlands in the lower 48 states is

   U.S. military aid to non-communist factions in
Cambodia should be boosted as high as $30 million to help prevent
the Khmer Rouge from returning to power, says Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y.
   ``Providing military assistance to non-communist resistance
forces will strengthen the ability of Cambodians wishing to resist
the Khmer Rouge'' after occupying Vietnamese forces are withdrawn in
September, Solarz told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on

   ``These are Cambodian forces who are willing to put their lives
on the line in order to prevent a repetition of the Khmer Rouge
holocaust,'' Solarz said. ``Don't we have a moral obligation to help
them out?''
   Solarz said he believes the $7 million in military aid sought by
the Bush administration is too little to do the job of strengthening
anti-communist forces.
   ``I would favor giving them more,'' Solarz said. ``This is not a
light or peripheral issue. This is a matter of preventing another
holocaust. For starters, I would provide somewhere between $20

<TEXT>
   Twin earthquakes that shook Los Angeles did
little harm, but they scared people and highlighted the danger from
recently discovered faults concealed deep beneath the nation's
second-largest city.
   The temblors, however, suggest the danger may be more likely to
come from a series of moderate quakes than from a much-feared ``big
one.''
   ``Nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake
any more than we did before,'' said U.S. Geological Survey
seismologist Lucile Jones. ``What happened today should make you
feel a little more relieved.''
   The Monday morning quakes injured one person and caused scattered
minor damage downtown and in suburbs to the east, including cracked
plaster, fallen ceiling tiles and broken windows.
   Scientists said the sharp jolts at 9:57 a.m. and 10:22 a.m.
measured 4.5 and 4.3 on the Richter scale, respectively. They were
centered on the Elysian Park Fault about 8{ miles beneath
Montebello, a city about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
At least five more small aftershocks followed.
   The temblors sent high-rise construction workers and window
washers sprinting into downtown Los Angeles streets and stranded
some elevator passengers momentarily.
   ``It felt like a bomb struck the building,'' said Sheila
Dickinson, a downtown worker.
   Panicky callers overloaded telephone lines, making it impossible
to get dial tones in many areas, said Michael Guerin of the
California Office of Emergency Services.
   Based on historical patterns, Southern California faces a 1
percent to 2 percent chance of a bigger earthquake within three
days, said Jones.
   The Elysian Park Fault cuts a 60-by-10-mile swath through the
heart of the Los Angeles Basin, stretching from Corona northwest to
Whittier, then west to downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Beverly
Hills, Santa Monica and Malibu.
   It was discovered after causing the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier
Narrows quake, which, with its aftershocks, killed eight people,
injured more than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   That quake also spurred discovery of another fault, the
40-by-10-mile Torrance-Wilmington Fault, stretching from Newport
Beach northwest through Long Beach, Los Angeles' Wilmington
district, Torrance and Santa Monica.
   Scientists don't know if the two faults relieve stress only by
causing numerous mild-to-moderate quakes of magnitude-4 to 6, or
also during infrequent major-to-great quakes of magnitude-7 to 8,
said geologist Kerry Sieh of the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena.
   A major quake directly under downtown Los Angeles would be far
worse than a ``big one'' on the more distant San Andreas Fault,
about 50 miles to the north. Officials estimate a big San Andreas
quake could kill up to 14,000 people, seriously injure up to 55,000
and cause $17 billion in damage.
   On the Richter scale of ground motion, every increase of one
number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage,
5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major''
earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great''
quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   The number of quakes in the basin has been twice normal since
March 1986, Jones said. Some scientists believe that suggests an
increased likelihood of a major quake, but the fact the recent
quakes on the Elysian Park Fault have been mild to moderate hints
that future quakes on the fault may be about the same, not larger,
she added.
   It takes many smaller quakes to release the same stress as a
disastrous jolt, so ``I don't think any of us would be surprised if
we had a flurry of 5s and 6s over the next 30 years,'' Sieh said.
   On Monday, one woman was treated for head, neck and back pain and
released from a hospital after a ceiling tile hit her at the
Criminal Courts Building.
   At the county Hall of Administration, many people attending a
Board of Supervisors meeting fled outside as ceiling and wall cracks
sprinkled falling plaster into the auditorium.
   The jolt also sent rookie basketball player David Rivers running
for the exit of the Forum, where the Los Angeles Lakers were
watching film of Sunday's game of the National Basketball
Association's championship series.
   ``I thought Kevin Johnson (of Phoenix) was the quickest guard in
the league, but not after I saw David run for the door,'' the
Lakers' Mychal Thompson said.

   Admitting years of steroid use in his quest to
become the world's fastest man, Ben Johnson said he knew the drugs
were banned but never would have taken them had he known of their
potentially harmful side effects.
   ``Nobody bothered to tell me what the side effects were because
they were happy to be making all this money,'' the Jamaican-born
sprinter told a Canadian inquiry into drugs and athletics on Monday.
   Nearly nine months ago, Johnson tested positive for the
muscle-building anabolic steroid stanozolol and was stripped in
Seoul of the 100-meter Olympic gold medal he won representing his
adopted country.
   Johnson, whose only previous statement since the disgrace had
been that he never knowingly used illegal drugs, still must tell the
inquiry what happened in the weeks leading up to Sept. 24, when he
tested positive.
   On Monday, under oath, Johnson started what could be several days
of testimony by admitting steriod use for the first time.
   ``Every shot that I got with an injection from (his coach and
teammates), I had in my own mind that it was banned,'' he said.
   Johnson said that his first use of steroids was in pill form in
1981 and 1982, the steroids Dianabol and stanozolol taken under
direction of Charlie Francis, his coach since 1977.
   ``Charlie's my coach and if he gave me something to take, I'd
take it,'' he said.
   But by the time of the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas,
Venezuela, Johnson said he was aware that he was getting steroids,
that they they were banned and that he risked disqualification if
they were found in his system.
   Johnson said he left to others the concern about clearance times,
or how long before competition he had to stop taking the drugs so
his system would be free of them.
   ``I'm not the coach, I just take orders,'' he said.
   He differed only from Francis and personal physician, Dr. Jamie
Astaphan, on the issue of whether they informed him about steroids'
potential for damaging health.
   ``If they told me what the side effects were at that time, I
wouldn't have been part of the group at all,' the 27-year-old
Johnson said.
   The sprinter said it was Francis' idea that he use steroids.
   ``I didn't go up to him and say I wanted to take it. He said the
whole world was using them and the only way I'd get better was if I
took these drugs,'' Johnson said.
   Francis delivered eight days of often sensational testimony to
the inquiry in February and March, saying he believes athletes need
to take them in order to be competitive because their use is
pervasive among world-class athletes.
   Astaphan confirmed in his appearance that he provided steroids
for Johnson since 1984. The doctor boasted of his ability to beat
steroid tests and could not explain why stanozolol was found in
Johnson's system at Seoul.
   Johnson's mother, two sisters and brother were in the hearing
room as the athlete calmly answered questions, often responding only
yes or no. His father was home in Jamaica.
   The athlete forfeited his 9.79-second performance at Seoul
because of the positive test but still holds the world record of
9.83 seconds set at Rome in 1987. He has said he hopes to compete
again after the end of the two-year ban that the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs world track and field,
imposed for the positive test.
   Estimates of the amount of endorsements and other income that
Johnson lost as a result of the Olympic scandal run as high as $20
million.

<HEAD>Rock Singer Promises No More Firebomb Jokes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rock singer Chrissie Hynde has promised to make no
more public remarks about firebombing McDonald's restaurants.
   The lead singer for The Pretenders had infuriated the fast-food
chain by her joking reply when asked what she had done for the
environmental group Greenpeace. ``I firebombed McDonald's,'' she
said last week.
   Police say they may want to interview Miss Hynde, who is a strict
vegetarian, in connection with a firebomb attack on a McDonald's in
suburban Milton Keynes last weekend.
   McDonald's threatened to take legal action against the singer,
who has frequently spoken out against McDonald's in the past, unless
she gave assurances that she would not repeat the inflammatory
remark.
   In a statement worked out by lawyers for the two parties, Miss
Hynde insisted Monday that her remarks Thursday at an
album-promoting Greenpeace news conference had been taken out of
context.
   ``However, I am prepared to give an unequivocal undertaking that
I will at no time suggest or imply that I have been responsible for
firebombing McDonald's or that anyone should firebomb or cause any
other physical or personal damage to the customers, employers,
franchises or the physical property of McDonald's Restaurants Ltd.
or any of its associated companies anywhere in the world.''
   McDonald's said it was satisfied with the statement and would
take no further legal action.
   No one was injured in Saturday's attack in Milton Keynes, and
Detective Chief Inspector Alan Partridge said Monday he had not
decided whether it was necessary to interview Miss Hynde.
   Detectives are investigating three similar attacks at McDonald's
in London and Birmingham. A group called the Animal Rights Militia
claimed responsibility an attack in Birmingham on April 29.

   A Southern Pacific freight train hit a
tractor-trailer rig and derailed, killing two transients riding
illegally on the train and injuring seven other people, authorities
said.
   Monday's wreck tossed all three engines and 21 cars onto their
sides or on top of each other. Sheriff Jim Bagwell said there was no
hazardous material in the cargo.
   ``Two people are deceased and we may have a third, we don't know.
The way cars are piled up, we can't substantiate another victim,''
Bagwell said.
   The missing person also was a transient, he said.
   Four other transients and the train crew were taken to Humboldt
General Hospital in Winnemucca for treatment. Three were flown to
Reno hospitals. The accident occurred at a crossing about 8 miles
southwest of Winnemucca, which is about 175 miles northeast of Reno.
   Bagwell said the freight was carrying dog food, wood products and
potatoes. About 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled along the track.
   He said the train struck a flatbed trailer pulled by a truck
after the vehicle became hung up just before noon on the rural
crossing. The truck driver was uninjured, but was treated for shock,
Bagwell said.
   A Southern Pacific spokesman in San Francisco, Jerry Pera, said
the 45-car train was heading from Oakland to Chicago and that crews
and equipment were en route to clear the wreckage and repair the
rails.

<TEXT>
   Officials welcomed a federal agency's
decision allowing the city to resume digging a ditch around its
reservoir to divert a stream allegedly contaminated at the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   ``I'm elated,'' City Manager George DiCiero said after learning
of the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   DiCiero said work on the ditch would resume today.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Roy Romer said he won assurance in Washington,
D.C., from James D. Watkins, head of the Department of Energy, that
the federal government would give the state what it needs to conduct
its own environmental testing at Rocky Flats.
   ``The purpose of the meeting was to deliver a message that they
either have to clean it up or close it,'' Romer said of the plant,
which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons. ``The response I got
from Adm. Watkins and his officials was absolute cooperation.''
   Romer said he also wants state workers to monitor the handling of
the hazardous waste at Rocky Flats, rather than relying on the DOE.
   ``I intend to put in place the kind of monitoring where we don't
need to rely on anybody else. We're going to have independent
verification,'' Romer said.
   Last Tuesday, 75 FBI agents and EPA investigators raided the
plant as part of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into
allegations of fraudulent disposal and burning of hazardous
materials at the site.
   An affidavit made public last week charged that hazardous
chemicals were dumped illegally into creeks at Rocky Flats last
November. The affidavit said the DOE, which owns the plant, and
Rockwell International Corp., which operates it, tried to conceal
the illegal disposal of wastes.
   Following the allegations, Broomfield last week began digging a
diversion ditch and building an earthen dam to divert Walnut Creek.
   Walnut Creek flows out of Rocky Flats into Great Western
Reservoir, which supplies half of Broomfield's drinking water. The
creek provides about 5 percent of the water needs of this Denver
suburb of 27,600 residents.
   The EPA had halted the work over the weekend, saying the city
needed federal permits. But EPA officials on Monday gave a go-ahead
after meeting with city and federal officials and visiting the site.
   ``The flow in the river is an absolute trickle,'' said Max
Dodson, director of water management for the EPA's Denver office.
``The size of the stream and of the impacted area is not that
significant.''
   Dodson said a letter of confirmation that the work could proceed
would be sent to the city by the Army Corps of Engineers.
   ``We want to do the diversion so we can have peace of mind and
tell our residents the water is safe,'' said George DiCiero,
Broomfield city manager.
   The state Health Department said samples taken over the weekend
of drinking water in Broomfield and other communities were not
contaminated by any of 59 organic substances typically analyzed in
checking drinking water.
   However, the state still was testing for 13 other chemicals cited
by federal investigators in their probe of Rocky Flats. Results were
expected later in the week, department assistant director Tom Looby
said.
   ``We are confident that these initial tests indicate that the
likelihood of any of the 13 chemicals being found in these drinking
water supplies is very, very small,'' Looby said.

   Officials will be watching this summmer to
see if new vapor control nozzles at gasoline stations noticeably
improve air quality in New Jersey, the second state to require the
devices.
   New Jersey officials imposed the regulations Jan. 1 on the
state's larger stations, hoping to decrease harmful ozone pollution
by between 3 percent and 5 percent to meet standards set by the
federal Clean Air Act. The state's smaller stations must comply by
next year.
   Legislation to enact gasoline vapor control programs is pending
in statehouses in Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, Pennsylvania
and Oregon, said S. William Becker, executive director of the
Association of State and Territorial Air Pollution Program
Administrators in Washington.
   But he said he would prefer national legislation to make the laws
uniform.
   ``We would prefer that Congress mandate it. What we have learned
in the Clean Air Act debate is that no progress is made and in fact
things just get worse unless we adopt innovative technology,'' he
said.
   The nozzles, which look like small black accordions, are designed
to capture vapors normally emitted by gasoline when it is pumped
into an automobile. A vapor-lock system routes the vapors back into
the station's underground holding tanks, where it reverts to liquid
form.
   New Jersey follows California in enacting vapor control
regulations. California has had the nozzles since Jan. 1, 1988.
Also, New York City, the District of Columbia, St. Louis and several
Florida cities have similar laws. John Elston, assistant director of
air quality management at the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, called the new nozzles a start in cleaning the air.
   ``This regulation moves us one step closer to the real problem:
the motoring public,'' he said.
   Many service station owners have opposed the new nozzles.
   ``We're not trying to stand in the way of progress, but we've
made a big capital outlay to comply with this for a very small
improvement in air quality,'' said John Holtz, associate director of
the New Jersey Petroleum Council. The council estimated the nozzles
cost an average of $29,000 per station.
   Rolando Idal, a gas station attendant at a busy Gulf station on
U.S. Highway 1&amp;9 in Elizabeth, doesn't like the new system for
another reason.
   Laboring between a truck belching exhaust fumes and a car whose
gas tank resisted the bulky nozzle, he said, ``Maybe it helps the
air, but they make it very hard to work. They click off at the wrong
time, they scratch up the cars, and the people think it's my fault.''

   After a fruitless search last year, the German
battleship Bismarck has been found on the ocean floor 600 miles off
the coast of France, 48 years after it was sunk by the British Navy.
   The Bismarck was located Monday under 15,000 feet of water by a
remote-controlled robot named Argo that scuttles across the ocean
floor. Argo and his master, expedition leader Dr. Robert Ballard,
also discovered the sunken Titanic four years ago.
   The Bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor ``intact in an
excellent state of preservation'' about 600 miles west of Brest on
the Brittany coast, said Ballard, who is based at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.
   The discovery is likely to trigger great curiosity among naval
historians, said Maj. Charles Neimeyer, a history professor at the
U.S. Naval Academy.
   ``They'll be looking for the sort of technology the Germans had
at the time, because this ship was considered state-of-the-art,'' he
said. The find could answer questions about the way the ship went
down and ``how the crew lived and survived at sea on a German
warship,'' he added.
   No human remains were found near the Bismarck, on which all but
about 100 of the 2,200 crew members perished. A memorial service for
those who perished was held aboard one of the expedition's ships.
   The ship will be left undisturbed as a grave site, like the
Titanic, according to David Gallo, assistant director of the Center
for Marine Exploration at Woods Hole. The battleship might be
explored by the sophisticated robot, though, Gallo said.
   Ballard and a research team searched several days for the
Bismarck last year. Instead of the Bismarck, the explorers found a
19th century sailing ship that has yet to be identified, Gallo said.
   ``There were quite a few reports about its position when it
sank,'' Gallo said. ``But the problem is, those reports can be off
by a mile or more, and a mile at sea, when you're looking at the sea
floor, represents a very large area to be covered in a search.''
   The demise of the dreaded Bismarck, which was equipped with eight
15-inch guns, began on May 24, 1941, when it encountered the Royal
Navy off the coast of Greenland.
   The Bismarck sank Britain's battle cruiser Hood but was hit by
the Prince of Wales. The Germans then fled south for occupied France
with the British in pursuit.
   Two days later, British warships and aircraft located the
crippled vessel and launched a furious attack. The Bismarck finally
went down the next day.
   The successful campaign was a significant victory for the Allies,
who thwarted Hitler's plan to use the Bismarck to raid Atlantic
Ocean shipping lanes.
   Neimeyer said the victory also gave a big psychological boost to
the Royal Navy, which was stunned by the loss of the Hood.
   ``Tis gave confidence to the carrier-aviation community that they
could indeed sink a battleship,'' he said.
   The expedition was jointly funded by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. and a group of private investors. The National Geographic
Society plans to produce a documentary on the discovery that will be
televised next fall.

<HEAD>Dollar Keeps Rising Against Yen, Stocks Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued its rise against the Japanese
yen Tuesday, causing a further decline in stock prices, dealers said.
   The dollar gained 0.30 yen, closing at 148.70 yen, its highest
level since Aug. 17, 1987, when it closed at 150.20 yen. On Monday,
the U.S. currency shot up 4.90 yen to 148.40 yen.
   After opening Tuesday at 148.80 yen, the dollar ranged between
148.45 and 149.75 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 184.46 points, or 0.55 percent, closing at 33,213.55. The index
dropped 241.97 points on Monday.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said continued dollar-buying was linked to a ``flight to
quality'' by investors.
   ``It is not that Japan itself is unstable, but to investors, the
dollar is still safer,'' he said.
   He said the violent suppression of demonstrators in China, a
major trading partner of Japan, was one reason for investors' flight
from the yen.
   Nevertheless, he said even if the dollar exceeds 150 yen, there
won't be a large impact on Japan.
   ``There is very little possibility that prices will rise,'' he
said.
   The dealer also said the Bank of Japan intervened several times
during the day in support of the yen, selling $1 billion in the U.S.
currency.
   The intervention helped to stop dollar-buying when the currency
neared the 150-yen level, he said, adding that dealers also began
profit-taking.
   The falling yen has discouraged stock purchases on the Tokyo
exchange, said an analyst at New Japan Securities, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   No stock received particular attention during the day's trading,
in which only 500 million shares were traded, he said.

   Some Chinese students who participated in Canadian
demonstrations protesting the massacre of students in Beijing say
their families have been placed under house arrest in China.
   About 15 students told parliamentarian James Karygiannis on
Monday that they fear for their families and for their lives if they
return to China.
   ``I'm scared and worried about my family,'' said one English
language student. ``I don't know if I will ever be able to see them
again, but I will continue demonstrating because the Chinese people
do not have any freedom.''
   He was among more than 250 people who attended the daylong
information session the Liberal Party member held to help residents
get work permits or get relatives out of China.
   The students said they sent their families photographs of
themselves protesting against the June 3-4 military assault in
central Beijing and newspaper clippings about unrest in the Chinese
capital.
   Police and customs officials opened the packages, said the
students, who did not want to be identified because they feared
further reprisals.
   The students also said their families told them not to telephone
home because the lines are tapped and not to return because they
will be imprisoned.
   External Affairs Minister Joe Clark on Monday said Canada's
ambassador in Beijing was being recalled temporarily to protest the
use of troops against unarmed civilians in China.
   China says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly soldiers, in the
June 3-4 assault. But Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence say
the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.

   Callers trying to reach a probation
office instead got an earful of sex talk from a panting woman named
Tina, officials said.
   On Monday, Southern Bell telephone officials said a computer
hacker had reprogrammed their equipment, routing overflow calls
intended for the local probation office to a New York-based phone
sex line.
   ``People are calling the Department of Corrections and getting
some kind of sex palace,'' said Thomas Slingluff, a spokesman for
the Palm Beach County probation office.
   Telephone company officials said it was the first time their
switching equipment has ever been reprogrammed by hackers.
   ``We're very alarmed,'' said Southern Bell spokesman Buck
Passmore. ``We've never had this happen ... not as far as our
telephone network is concerned.''
   Passmore and Slingluff said callers heard a recorded voice
offering them a variety of raunchy sexual narratives by pushing
buttons on their touch-tone telephones.
   ``It was really bad,'' Passmore said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in moderate European trading late
this morning as the market tried to find a new trading range,
foreign currency dealers said.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers in West Germany said the market was nervous after the
dollar hit its highest level since November 1986 at around 2.0370
marks on Monday.
   ``We may test the 2.03 (mark-level) again, but that also seems to
be a good basis for people who are long to take profit,'' said one
dealer at a bank in Munich.
   Dealers said the market is also waiting for a flurry of U.S.
economic indicators to be released this week including retail
figures for May later today and the May consumer price index on
Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 148.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _2.0235 West German marks, down from 2.0250
   _1.7430 Swiss francs, down from 1.7550
   _6.8425 French francs, down from 6.8620

   _1,460.25 Italian lire, down from 1,463.50
   _1.2005 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2024
   The dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5205 to buy
one pound in London at midmorning, compared with $1.525 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $361 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $359.95. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $360.35, up from $359 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.63 to close at a bid $361.66.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.22 a troy ounce, up from
Monday's $5.20.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled through the Midwest and the South today,
dumping rain and whipping up winds. Texas got the brunt of the
severe storms earlier, with tornadoes and hail striking the
Panhandle.
   Tornadoes touched down Monday night in the northern Texas
Panhandle near Fritch, Hedley, and Whiteflat, and in Middleton,
Tenn. Thunderstorm winds gusted to 65 mph near Childress, Texas.
   Hail the size of baseballs pummelled Lefors, Texas, and further
south, hail fell at Post and Lubbock. Golfball-sized hail fell at
St. Francis, near Lamesa, at Fargo, near Brice, and west of Spur.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was posted early today over much of
northern Alabama. A tornado watch also was posted over portions of
southwest Oklahoma and north-central and western Texas.
   In Corning, Ohio, high winds Monday night tore the roofs off
homes and caused power outages, but no one was seriously injured.
About 15 homes in the southeastern Ohio city sustained wind damage,
police said.
   Flood watches were in effect for parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas.
   Thunderstorms this morning extended from western Oklahoma across
the Texas Panhandle and north-central Texas through northwest Texas
and northeast New Mexico, as well as from northern Mississippi
across northwest Alabama and central Tennessee, also scattered over
south central Missouri and central Illinois.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
2 inches at Jackson, Tenn., and almost 2 inches at Amarillo, Texas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
southern Rockies across the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley and Tennessee Valley to the Atlantic states
from central Maine through North Carolina, over the lower Great
Lakes; and rain from upper Michigan across Minnesota and the Dakotas
to eastern Montana.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s from upper
Michigan across the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern Plains
to western portions of the central Plains; in the 60s over much of
New England and along much of the Pacific Coast; in the 90s over
portions of eastern Washington and northeast Oregon, and from
interior valleys of California across the desert Southwest, southern
Texas and the Gulf Coast region to the southern Atlantic states;
reaching 100 degrees in portions of the desert Southwest and along
the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; and in the 70s and 80s throughout
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Gunnison, Colo., to 89 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

   Student leaders say that Chinese consulates
in San Francisco and in New York City have been taking pictures and
compiling lists of participants in demonstrations against the
Beijing government.
   At a protest at the consulate in San Francisco immediately after
the massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, consulate staff were at
the windows and on the roof of the building with still and video
cameras, student protesters said Monday.
   ``Everyone saw them. We just shouted `Stop it!''' said Yu
Maochen, a graduate student at the University of California at
Berkeley.
   ``We were very angry. It's my suspicion they did it every time.
It's for some kind of blacklist, that's for sure,'' Yu said.
   In New York, Ding Chu, general secretary of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, said consular staff also were seen with cameras in
the windows during recent demonstrations.
   Some students in New York also said staff from the consulate came
to their campuses recently and questioned them about those taking
part in demonstrations, said Ding.
   Student leaders say any Chinese national who speaks out against
the Beijing government faces certain persecution in their homeland.
   Despite the risks in anti-government demonstrations, Chinese
students in the United States are not interested in seeking
political asylum, students at Stanford University said.
   ``Most Chinese students would agree that political asylum is the
last thing we would want. It's akin to treason,'' said Douglas Pan,
a graduate student and member of The Association of Chinese Students
and Scholars at Stanford.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence say the toll from the
June 3-4 assault in and around Tiananmen Square could be as high as
3,000, most of them civilians. China's government says nearly 300
people were killed, mostly soldiers.

<TEXT>
   In the past 30 years, newspapers have gone
from typewriters and popping flashbulbs to computers and electronic
darkrooms, but even more technological advances are ahead, said
newspaper publisher Walter H. Cowles III.
   ``That was good progress,'' Cowles, president and publisher of
the Spokane, Wash., Spokesman-Review and the Spokane Chronicle, told
the 61st annual meeting of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association on Monday. Cowles is chairman of the association.
   ``Today's `protocol for progress,' however, demands that we focus
not what's behind our taillights, but rather on what's in front of
our headlights,'' he said.
   The APNA convention is being held in conjunction with displays of
futuristic technology, and its theme is ``Protocols for Progress.''
   ``Every year we have a little clutch of fear that our technology
is about to plateau; and every year it doesn't. This means we just
have time to take a deep breath before we have to start learning
again.''
   In addition to 300 displays of the latest technology, there will
be workshops on the newest production, administration, sales
techniques and news gathering techniques discussed in workshop
sessions. The convention ends on Wednesday.
   Reg Murphy, the publisher and chief executive officer of The Sun
in Baltimore blamed a 10 percent drop in newspaper readership over
the past several years on illiteracy, competition with other news
media and competition for readers' time.
   ``People who can't read don't buy newspapers,'' Murphy said
Monday.
   The fight for literacy was one example Murphy gave of the sort of
community involvement newspapers should have if they are to compete
successfully for readers and advertising money.
   ``The toughest competition in our game is for the time of our
readers,'' he said.
   ``You won't find many women lingering over the newspaper with
their coffee anymore,'' he said. ``They might like to, but they have
corporations to run and surgery to perform.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces fought with
tanks and recoilless rifles in hills southeast of Beirut today,
dampening hopes that Arab League efforts would swiftly end the
latest outbreak in the 14-year civil war.
   A spokesman for Christian army commander Michel Aoun said Syrian
gunners were shelling his forces' positions in hills around the
mountain town of Souk el-Gharb as well as in Beirut's Christian
suburbs of Kfarshima and Hadath.
   He said the Syrians were shelling from positions in the village
of Aitat, opposite Souk el-Gharb, and from the suburb of Choueifat.
   The spokesman accused the Syrians of starting the barrage as Arab
League Assistant Secretary General Lakhdar Ibrahimi crossed Beirut's
dividing Green Line for talks with Gen. Aoun and other Christian
leaders in east Beirut.
   ``They shelled us with tank cannons and recoilless rifles. We are
responding in kind,'' said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   He accused the Syrians of provoking the fighting to ``foil
efforts by Arab leaders to work out a solid cease-fire.''
   Shortly before dawn, Syrian howitzer batteries deployed in Moslem
west Beirut fired 20 shells at the coastline north of the city in an
apparent effort to maintain a blockade of Christian ports.
   Police said the 130mm shells exploded around the ports of Byblos
and Jounieh. No casualties were reported.
   The renewed shelling after a two-day lull contrasted sharply with
reports in Lebanese media that a cease-fire agreement had been
worked out by Ibrahimi in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   The pro-Syrian daily paper As-Safir reported in its main story
today that ``an air of optimism prevails over the situation in light
of Ibrahimi's talks.''
   Ibrahimi arrived in west Beirut from Damascus on Monday. He held
talks in the city's Moslem sector with Salim Hoss, Aoun's rival as
head of the Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual government.
   In Damascus, Ibrahimi met over the weekend with President Hafez
Assad and his foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem sectors of
Lebanon extending from the northern Akkar plain across the eastern
Bekaa valley to west and south Beirut.
   The official Syrian news agency, SANA, quoted al-Sharaa as saying
the Damascus talks centered on ``the need for the warring Lebanese
factions to reach agreement on the mechanism for lifting blockades,
reopening crossing points and making the cease-fire comprehensive.''
   The current round of violence broke out March 8, two days after
Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut in order to salvage lost customs dues of around $100 million
annually.
   The Syrians and their Moslem militia allies retaliated by
blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the
capital that is home to 1 million Christians.
   At least 367 people have been killed and 1,432 wounded in the
confrontation, by police count.
   Aoun has agreed to previous Arab calls that he should lift the
blockade. The Syrians, however, have refused to call off their siege
of the Christian enclave to prevent Aoun from obtaining
Iraqi-shipped war materiel.

<HEAD>Investigators Reportedly Seek to Question Lawyer in HUD Embezzlement
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators probing embezzlement in
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development want to
question a lawyer about the disappearance of $3 million in the
Washington area, a newspaper reported.
   Earl Martin, who has been missing for about a year, is wanted for
questioning in the probe of HUD's Washington field office, which
administers federal housing programs in the District of Columbia and
its Maryland and Virginia suburbs, The Sun in Baltimore reported
today.
   Martin was a closing agent who represented HUD at settlement when
it sold houses in the District of Columbia. He worked for the
Washington office at the same time as Maryland real estate agent
Marilyn Louis Harrell, who allegedly embezzled $5.5 million as a
closing agent for the department in the Maryland suburbs.
   Ms. Harrell, who has not been charged, has admitted taking the
funds and claimed she gave the money to charities. Because of that
investigators have nicknamed her ``Robin HUD.''
   The Sun reported that neither Martin nor Harrell were bonded as a
precaution against theft or loss.
   ``It's another example of incredible carelessness,'' the
newspaper quoted a senior HUD official as saying. ``The Washington
office was in a state of total disarray.''
   Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported today that HUD this week
will begin a systematic review of property sales, demanding that 53
field offices explain what happened to any unaccounted-for proceeds,
according to a memo from Secretary Jack Kemp.
   The Post said the content of the memo was disclosed by a senior
HUD official who estimated that as much as $100 million may be
unaccounted for. The source based the estimate on the early findings
of audits of 11 field offices, the newspaper reported.
   The Washington probe is one of several being conducted throughout
the country. In Dallas, a closing agent has been indicted in
connection with the theft of $2.5 million in HUD funds. Probes also
are underway in Denver, Los Angeles and New Orleans.
   HUD officials were able to provide little information about
Martin, The Sun reported. Motor vehicle records showed Martin lived
in Potomac, Md. Neighbors said Martin ran into financial trouble and
sold his house last year, the newspaper reported.
   Ms. Harrell said Monday she was glad the embezzlement was finally
discovered.
   ``It really got out of hand,'' she said in an interview at her
Camp Spring, Md., home. ``I'm not at all proud of it. I'm really
glad it's out in the open. To carry this inside is so difficult. Why
try to say I didn't do it? I did it and I'm not proud of it at all.''
   Ms. Harrell said she used the HUD money in the past four years to
fund a variety of charities in Baltimore and suburban Washington
that serve the homeless, drug addicts, suicidal teens and the
elderly.
   ``I was just drawn into it,'' she said. ``HUD doesn't serve the
poor. There's no way they serve the poor. They dispossess the poor
and I think that's unconscionable.''

<HEAD>Kraft Calls Off Game After Everybody Wins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft is apologizing, but consumers say it's
pretty cheesy that the food maker called off a promotional contest
in which thousands of consumers stood to win a new van.
   The ``Ready to Roll'' contest required consumers to match the
right half of game pieces carried in advertisements in Sunday
newspapers with left-sided pieces inserted in packages of specially
marked Kraft Singles cheese slices. The ads ran in the Chicago and
Houston areas.
   Kraft planned to give away one Dodge Caravan, valued at $17,000;
100 bicycles; 500 skateboards; and 8,000 packages of Kraft Singles.
   According to the company, the odds of winning the van were 1 in
15.2 million.
   But because of an error by the printer of the game pieces inside
the cheese packages, it is likely that ``thousands and thousands''
would have won the van, said Kathy Knuth, spokeswoman for the
foodmaker based in suburban Glenview.
   ``Instead of only a limited number of winning game pieces,'' a
company statement read, ``essentially all of the game pieces appear
to be winning ones.''
   Kraft declared the contest null and void and pulled packages of
Singles from stores in Chicago and Houston.
   ``The company regrets any confusion this promotion may have
caused,'' Knuth said.
   Some consumers who ``won'' the Dodge think they're getting a
dodge from Kraft.
   ``I'm not letting them get away with this baloney,'' said Sharon
LaMont of suburban Skokie, who claims to be a van winner along with
her sister and mother.
   ``I won a Dodge Caravan and four skateboards,'' said Karen
Winslow of Des Plaines. ``Now, when I send it in, I'll probably get
a packet of coupons for Kraft cheese or something like that.''

   The creator of the ``Happy Face'' says he is
absolutely serious about running for mayor, although the grinning
symbol he created in 1967 graces his campaign signs.
   ``I am a serious candidate,'' said David Stern. ``Behind the
happy face, there's a thoughtful, committed, caring human being who
wants to serve as mayor of this city.''
   Stern, 52, the son of former King County Council member Bernice
Stern, became the 10th contender Monday in the race to succeed Mayor
Charles Royer, who is not seeking re-election to a fourth term.
   Stern's small advertising firm, which he closed and converted
into a campaign headquarters this spring, designed the grinning
Happy Face for University Federal Savings and Loan in Seattle 22
years ago. The symbol spread across the nation.

   Boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns
battled for 12 rounds, but when it was over neither had won. The
three judges ruled it a draw.
   Judge Tommy Kaczmarek scored Monday night's bout in Leonard's
favor, 113-112. Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113-112 for
Hearns. Judge Dalby Shirley called it even, 112-112.
   Leonard, 33, who retained his World Boxing Council super

boxing match. But a Leonard rally in the final round gained him a
draw.
   ``We both displayed what champions are made of,'' said Leonard,
33. ``Like Tommy said, we'll leave it to the judges. I accept it.''
   ``I'm proud of having a draw,'' said a jubilant Hearns, 30. ``It
could have gone the other way, so I'm grateful I got a draw.''
   Leonard won the undisputed welterweight title in 1981 by beating
Hearns.
   After Monday's fight, the two talked of another match, but
Leonard said, ``Let's go home and rest a while.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students calling for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo today battled riot police with
firebombs and stones after holding rallies to denounce a government
crackdown on dissidents.
   Clashes between police and protesters broke out at six Seoul
colleges while peaceful protests were held at six other campuses.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets ringed
all the colleges to stop protesters from marching into the streets.
   The clashes came amid conflicting reports that Roh intends to
shuffle his Cabinet and remove senior ministers he believes have not
performed effectively. About 300 protesters, some of them armed with
wooden clubs and iron pipes, battled police with firebombs at Sogang
University in western Seoul after the students marched out of the
campus beating drums and waving flags.
   Hundreds of riot troopers blocked nearby streets and hurled rocks
at the students but did not use tear gas. Students hurling rocks
battled riot police at nearby Yonsei University after they were
blocked from marching out.
   ``Beat Roh Tae-woo to death!'' and ``Oust Roh Tae-woo!'' students
chanted.
   Police said they had no reports of arrests or serious injuries.
   Student leaders, speaking at campus rallies, denounced the
government for a crackdown in recent weeks on dissident groups and
demanded the release of scores of jailed dissident leaders.
   Police carried out the crackdown to curb a recent wave of violent
protests.
   The violent campus clashes were the largest in recent weeks. Some
radical students said in May they would stop using firebombs after
seven riot police were killed in a demonstration.
   But student groups have started to use firebombs and other
weapons again. Thousands of students battled police in running
street clashes in central Seoul on Saturday, and more than 1,000
people were arrested.
   The radicals and alllied dissident groups are calling for Roh's
ouster and demanding to take part in a youth festival in Communist
North Korea next month. The government has banned their
participation because of its bitter rivalry with the North.
   The radicals have little public support because of their violent
tactics and extremist views.
   South Korean news reports today said Roh was considering removing
some Cabinet ministers who have failed to carry out their tasks or
been linked to unpopular policies. There have been persistent
reports for weeks of Cabinet changes.
   The administration had no comment on the reports.
   Roh announced last week he would not keep an election promise to
hold a midterm referendum on his performance. He said a referendum
would generate political unrest, but some opposition groups are
demanding a vote.
   Roh, a former army general, won presidential elections in late
1987.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a setback for the prosecution, a
witness today changed his story in court and supported the alibi of
a friend _ the man accused of killing Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   The testimony came during the second week of the trial of Carl
Gustaf Christer Pettersson, who is accused of shooting Palme to
death in 1986 as the four-term Swedish leader was walking home with
his wife from a movie.
   Witness Ulf Stinnars, 35, claimed police interrogators had hinted
that he could be eligible for the 50 million kronor ($8 million)
reward if his testimony about Pettersson's whereabouts after the
shooting was helpful.
   ``The police tried to coax me with money. They said, `50 million,
50 million,''' Stinnars told the court.
   Stinnars, led into the courtroom between two policemen, wore a
tattered jeans jacket and jogging pants and refused to remove his
baseball cap and sunglasses, apparently to keep his face hidden from
courtroom artists.
   He also refused to speak until the court agreed that his
testimony would not be broadcast on national radio. Previous
sessions have been broadcast.
   After a 15-minute recess, Chief Magistrate Michael af Geijerstam
ordered the radio not to transmit from the courtroom.
   Stinnars was called by the prosecution to repeat his story that
Pettersson returned to his suburban apartment about 12:30 or 1 a.m.
on the night of the shooting, countering Pettersson's alibi.
   But Stinners withdrew that story in court, saying he now believed
the defendant had been home before midnight on Feb. 28, 1986. If
true, it would mean Pettersson could not have shot Palme in downtown
Stockholm at 11:23 p.m.
   ``I can't remember. I've thought about this for three months and
I don't want to lie here, so I can't say I'm sure,'' Stinnars said.
   He acknowledged that he had spoken with Pettersson about the hour
Pettersson returned, but denied his friend had intimidated him to
change his story.
   Stinnars also said he was taking drugs when he was first
questioned by police, and his memory was impaired.
   He said he waited at the apartment while Pettersson went into
town to get a supply of drugs. They often got drunk and used drugs
together, he testified.
   Pettersson, 42, who has a police record of more than 60 crimes,
including a manslaughter conviction, has pleaded innocent.
   On Wednesday, the prosecution is expected to call its key
witness, Lisbet Palme, who is expected to identify Pettersson as the
man she saw fleeing after her husband was shot.
   In an adjoining room of the District Court, the former Stockholm
police commissioner who led the initial murder investigation was
acquitted today of charges of disclosing secret information about
the investigation.
   The court found that Hans Holmer had not violated secrecy or
libel laws in his 1988 book ``Palme Is Shot,'' in which he described
the surveillance of suspects and disclosed the identity of witnesses.
   Holmer was fired in February 1987.

<HEAD>Birmingham Mayor Says Ruling is a Setback for Civil Rights</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Affirmative Action, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor says a U.S. Supreme Court
decision enabling white firefighters to challenge the city's
racially tailored hiring plan is a setback for civil rights.
   ``Certainly it's part of what I think is a carefully designed
plan to turn the clock back on affirmative action, period,
everywhere,'' Mayor Richard Arrington, the city's first black mayor,
said after the ruling Monday.
   ``We're very, very disappointed. ... It's going to be a long, hot
summer.''
   Ray Fitzpatrick, a lawyer for the city's firefighters union, said
the decision is a step toward ending race-based policies that hurt
white workers.
   In its 5-4 decision, the high court held that the affirmative
action plan approved by the city and a lower court is open to
challenge by workers who took no part in the case that led to the
agreement.
   The case is expected to go to trial in federal court, but no date
has been set.
   Fire Chief Neal Gallant declined to comment on the decision.
   A civil rights attorney said Birmingham's history makes it ideal
for testing affirmative action.
   In the 1960s, segregated Birmingham was the site of civil rights
protests in which police used firehoses and dogs against
demonstrators, many of them children. News coverage of the protests
galvanized the civil rights movement.
   ``You would have to ignore several hundred years of United States
history to find there wasn't sufficient record'' to warrant
affirmative action here, said Robert Joffe of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Joffe, in a telephone interview from New York, said the decision
``is just another, unfortunately, in a too long line of recent cases
in which the Supreme Court has put up roadblocks in the way of
affirmative action.''
   The case began in 1974 when the NAACP and blacks filed a lawsuit
charging racial bias in the Fire Department. Both sides eventually
agreed on a plan for hiring and promoting minorities.
   Seven white firefighters challenged the plan, saying
less-qualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them.
   A federal judge ruled the white firefighters must abide by the
consent decree. But a federal appeals court in 1987 reinstated the
lawsuit, and the Supreme Court agreed.
   Lt. Charles Brush, president of the union local, said many whites
have left the department after being passed over for promotions by
blacks with less seniority.
   Birmingham's population of 276,000 is about 55 percent black and
45 percent white. Of 497 firefighters, 379, or 76 percent, are white
and 118, or 24 percent, are black. Of 151 officers, 38, or 25
percent, are black.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch led the Last Crusade against higher movie

   Cineplex blamed the cost of building, operating and renovating
its theaters when it announced Monday an increase in the price of a

   Cineplex owns 1,820 screens in 500 locations in North America.

<HEAD>Reagan Says West Must Take `Risks' With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan urged the West today to
take risks with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying he was
``the Soviets' best and probably only hope to turn things around.''
   Reagan also declared that the Chinese government ``hasn't learned
something very elementary: you can't massacre an idea. You cannot
run tanks over hope. You cannot riddle a people's yearning with
bullets.''
   In a speech on his first visit to London since stepping down as
president, Reagan painted a sweeping picture of a world gripped by
an information revolution in which computers and satellite dishes
would inevitably dissolve the barriers between East and West and
democracy would supplant communism.
   ``I believe Mikhail Gorbachev is the Soviets' best and probably
only hope to turn things around,'' Reagan said.
   ``It is true that the West could stand pat while this is
happening. We are not the ones who must change. It is not our people
who're isolated from the information that allows them to be creative
and productive,'' he said.
   ``But it is exactly when you are strong and comfortable that you
should take risks.''
   He said: `` I believe we should take the risk that the Soviets
are serious in their efforts to reach genuine arms reductions with
the West. I support President Bush's proposal to keep pressure on
the Soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms.''
   Reagan was addressing an array of dignitaries of the English
Speaking Union at the Guildhall, the ornate 1,000-year-old seat of
London's civic government, where 13 months ago he gave a speech en
route home after visiting Gorbachev in Moscow.
   Gorbachev, who is in West Germany this week for his first state
visit to that country, spoke at Guildhall in April.
   Reagan said ``I'm more optimistic than ever in my life about
peace and democracy in this world.'' He said ``amazing things are
afoot in the world this spring.''
   ``Those heroic Chinese students who gave their lives have
released the spirit of democracy and it cannot be called back,'' he
said, referring to the student-led movement for a freer China and
the Chinese government's violent crackdown on it.
   Hungary, he said, was dismantling part of its barbed-wire border
fence with Austria and moving to multi-party democracy; Poland had
legalized the Catholic Church and held its most open elections in 40
years; dissident Andrei Sakharov now sits in the Soviet parliament.
   Communist countries were still trying to suppress the free flow
of information by restricting the use of photocopying machines,
typewriters, TV satellite dishes and cross-border computer linkups,
Reagan said.
   But ``the biggest of Big Brothers is increasingly helpless
against communications technology,'' he said.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived quietly on Sunday for a
four-day visit, and were to dine with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday. Prince
Charles, her son and heir, has invited the Reagans for drinks.
   On Monday, Burke's Peerage said Reagan has been offered an
honorary knighthood and has accepted the highest royal honor Britain
bestows on Americans. But Buckingham Palace and Reagan's press
spokesman, Mark Weinberg, refused comment on the report.
   British honors are formally awarded by the queen although most
are made on the recommendation of Mrs. Thatcher.

<TEXT>
   Friends of a judge who was shot to
death in her chambers by her estranged husband took comfort when he
was sentenced to two life terms.
   The trial of 53-year-old former policeman Clarence Ratliff caused
outrage last month when he was convicted of manslaughter instead of
murder for killing District Judge Carol S. Irons on Oct. 19.
   ``I think our message was heard,'' said Sara Smolenski, a friend
of Irons who organized a petition drive and letter campaign calling
for the maximum sentence.
   Ratliff on Monday was given the maximum 10 to 15 years for
voluntary manslaughter and two life terms _ the maximum _ for
assault with intent to murder for shooting at officers who tried to
help the mortally wounded Irons. Neither officer was hit.
   The sentences will run concurrently. Ratliff will be eligible for
parole in 10 years. A murder conviction could have resulted in life
without parole.
   Irons' friends and relatives hugged outside the courtroom after
the sentencing.
   Circuit Judge Dennis Kolenda said community sentiment played a
part in his decision to exceed sentencing guidelines calling for
seven to 15 years for assault with intent to murder. He also said
the site of the crime and Ratliff's position compounded the
seriousness of the slaying.
   ``By resolving your dispute in the most violent way known to
human nature, by doing it in the place where peaceful resolution is
always supposed to happen, you struck close to a mortal blow to the
peace ... of this community,'' Kolenda told Ratliff.
   Ratliff had contended he didn't plan to kill Irons but was drunk
and angry about a property dispute in their divorce proceedings.
   Before the sentencing, friends, family and co-workers of Irons,
40, addressed the court, criticizing the law that allowed Ratliff
and defense witnesses to discuss Irons' alleged extramarital affairs.
   ``As the trial went on and Carol's character was assassinated
daily. ... I waited and waited for some sign of remorse on the part
of the defendant,'' said Nora Lee Carrier Potts.
   Potts said she hoped the sentence would eliminate society's
acceptance of ``the little boy excuse of `I couldn't help it. She
made me mad.'''

<TEXT>
   Southern Baptists put off a proposal to set up a
conservative lobbying group in Washington, clearing the decks for
the election today of a president of the nation's largest Protestant
denomination.
   The denomination's Executive Committee voted unanimously Monday
to wait until next year's convention to recommend creation of a
Religious Liberty Commission to lobby on issues such as school
prayer and tuition tax credits.
   That left the election between 44-year-old Daniel Vestal, pastor
of Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta, and incumbent Jerry
Vines, 51, pastor of First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Fla., as
the only major issue of the convention.
   Vines asked the Executive Committee to postpone the proposal for
a Religious Liberty Commission in the interests of ``a peaceful
convention meeting and a positive witness'' in Las Vegas.
   But the battle lines continued to be drawn as moderates hoped to
reverse a decade-long string of conservative victories in
presidential elections.
   ``I think the Southern Baptist Convention is in serious
condition, serious trouble,'' said Daniel Vestal, the moderate
candidate for the presidency. ``A lot of people are at the point of
dropping out.''
   The 14.8 million-member denomination has more than doubled its
membership in the past quarter-century, but has grown by barely more
than half a percent in each of the last two years.
   The convention presidency is considered a critical post because
the officer appoints the Committee on Committees, which has a
central role in selecting people for the convention's boards,
commissions and committees.
   Vines is scheduled to address the convention prior to the
election today, while Vestal appealed to delegates Sunday and Monday
evenings in half-hour programs on a local television station paid
for by his supporters.
   Also Monday, PBS reporter Bill Moyers withdrew a request to
appear before the executive committee to discuss its criticism of
his ``God and Politics'' documentary. The committee in February said
the documentary was biased in support of Southern Baptist moderates.
   Moyers said in a letter to the committee that he realized ``I am
up against a situation most un-Baptist: closed minds, and in the
parlance of your host city, a stacked deck.''
   In other pre-convention business, a conservative pastor, Tom
Elliff, pastor of First Southern Baptist Church in suburban Oklahoma
City, was elected president of the 6,000-member SBC Pastor's
Conference.
   The central issues in the debate between the Southern Baptist
moderates and conservatives cross over theological and political
boundaries.
   Conservatives accuse moderates of being open to biblical
interpretations that challenge the foundations of Southern Baptist
faith.
   But the moderates charge conservatives with violating another
central belief of Southern Baptists _ that individuals are able to
interpret the Bible for themselves.
   The issues have engendered passionate debate. But Paul Pressler,
a Houston judge who has helped rally conservatives to 10 straight
presidential victories since 1979, said even if the moderates win
the presidential election, the war is over.
   ``The course correction has been made,'' he said.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Edged Up 0.1 Percent in May</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose a sluggish 0.1 percent in
May, held down by a big decline in department store revenues and a
slowdown in movement of automobiles off dealers' lots, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $141.1 billion last month after rising 1 percent in April.
The April figure had been revised upward from 0.4 percent. Sales had
fallen 0.4 percent in February and risen 0.1 percent in March.
   Economists had anticipated a weak sales increase of about 0.2
percent in May. Major retailers reported sluggish sales that month
as interest rates remained near their early-spring peak.
   The Federal Reserve Board paused recently in its efforts to push
rates up to slow the economy and dampen inflation, and rates have
begun to fall slightly.
   Auto sales slowed to a 0.2 percent rise in May following a strong
2 percent rise in April. In both months, carmakers had offered
incentives such as rebates and low interest rates to lure buyers
into showrooms.
   Auto sales in the first five months of 1989 were 2.3 percent
higher than those during the same period last year. That was less
than the rate of inflation.
   Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales.
   Excluding the automotive category, sales rose 0.1 percent
following a hike of 0.7 percent in April and a 0.1 percent decrease
in March.
   Department and other general merchandise stores and specialty
clothing shops accounted for much of the slower sales pace. Sales of
general merchandise fell 1.2 percent and clothing shops dropped 1.4
percent.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
more than three years, rose 0.3 percent after rising 1.8 percent in
April largely on the strength of auto sales.
   Non-durable goods sales were flat following an increase of 0.6
percent in April.
   The following categories also reported sales increases in May:
food and grocery stores, 0.5 percent; gasoline stations, 0.9
percent; and drug stores, 1.8 percent.
   Categories posting declines included bars and restaurants, down
0.4 percent. Building materials and furniture sales were flat.
   For the three months from March through May, overall retail sales
were up 5.1 percent from the same period in 1988.

   He may have been half a hemisphere
away, but there was one thing back home in Washington that did not
slip the mind of Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``George Bush's birthday is something I could not forget,''
Quayle said Monday as he sat in the luxurious hilltop residence of
U.S. Ambassador Everett E. Briggs.
   Quayle had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a
day filled with plane, helicopter and motorcade trips across two
countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region.
   ``Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday,'' Quayle
said.
   He said he cabled birthday greetings to Washington for the
president. But his 67-year-old mother, Corinne, had to wait for her
son's birthday wish.
   The vice president said he had tried to reach her but didn't know
where she was.

   Quayle's family was also on his mind Monday as his motorcade sped
through Guatemala City.
   The vice president called the motorcade to a halt in front of a
small, open-air store and went on a short shopping spree as a crowd
of onlookers gathered.
   The saleswoman showed him T-shirts and a peasant skirt, but
Quayle had his eye on the store's assortment of soccer balls.
   Quayle bought one, saying his children _ Tucker, Benjamin and
Corinne _ were very good at the sport. But he tried it out first on
the crowd out on the sidewalk, tossing it to one lad, who deftly
returned it each time with his head.
   Quayle then threw the ball into a crowd of adults who scrambled
all over it. ``I'll never see that,'' Quayle laughed in an aside,
apparently thinking he would not get the ball back. But sure enough
it popped into the air, tossed right to him as he entered his limo.

   Quayle's visit to the U.S. military training installation at Soto
Cano Air Force Base caused considerable interest among the service
members who are restricted to the base for their training.
   Quayle reviewed the troops, dressed in camouflage fatigues, then
headed to the rustic wooden mess hall for a cafeteria lunch of beef,
potatoes and salad. Quayle had 20 men sitting on either side of him.
   How were these soldiers selected from the 1,200 at the base?
   Army chaplain Brent Causey of Sacramento, Calif., said he won the
privilege of sitting at the head of the table because he happened to
be the only chaplain. The others were commanders and ``soldier of
the month'' winners.
   Soldiers of the month are selected from each service _ Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marines _ on the basis of an academic test,
according to Causey. The soldiers are tested on such skills as
mathematics and other school subjects, he said.

   Educators here have drawn the line against
naming a school for the Alamo hero William Barret Travis. The
problem: skeletons in his closet.
   It turns out the man who drew the famous line in the dirt during
the defense of the chapel-fort in 1836 abandoned his wife and child
and owned slaves.
   Bryan school trustees voted Monday night to name the school
instead after black educator Mary Branch, the first woman college
president in Texas.
   Countless schools and streets in Texas are named for Travis. In
fact, the school named for Branch will replace Bryan's Travis
Elementary School, which will close next year. Bryan is a town of
59,000 about 60 miles from Houston.
   During the siege of the Alamo, Travis wrote an appeal for help.
Legend also has it that when the defenders were surrounded by
Mexican troops, he drew a line and asked those willing to die for
freedom to cross it with him.
   Trustee Wendy Costa pointed out that Travis had abandoned his
family. Noting also that Bryan's population is 22 percent black, she
asked, ``How can we even consider naming a school after someone who
was so strongly in favor of slavery?''
   Bob Calvert of the Texas State Historical Society described
Travis as a ``ne'er-do-well who in two weeks' time happened to do
something wonderful.''
   ``All of my life I've been told that William Barret Travis is the
greatest Texas hero,'' said Trustee Travis Bryan Jr. ``No power on
earth can convince me he's not, not even Wendy Costa.''
   ``The name of William Barret Travis must be sustained. I'm going
to vote for him, even if everybody votes against me,'' Bryan said.
   The vote was 4-3 in favor of Ms. Branch.

<TEXT>
   Civil rights advocates seeking to prevent
affirmative action programs from being rolled back are shifting
their sights to Congress following a series of major setbacks in the
Supreme Court.
   ``It is just not possible for civil rights advocates to do
business in federal courts any more,'' Russell Galloway, a professor
at the Santa Clara University School of Law in California, said
Monday.
   Galloway and others commented after the high court ruled 5-4 that
white firefighters in Birmingham, Ala., are entitled to bring suit
to attack an affirmative action plan approved eight years ago to
settle a lawsuit. The white firefighters were not a party to the
lawsuit and say they should not be governed by a settlement in which
they had no say.
   The decision was the latest in a series of high court decisions
chipping away at affirmative action programs, which have been used
to give hiring and promotion preference to minorities and women.
   Civil rights groups contend the programs are necessary to
compensate for years of past discrimination, but the high court's
conservative majority is showing a new concern over the issue of
reverse discrimination.
   The court ruled in January that state and local governments may
generally not impose racial quotas for hiring on public works
projects. And on June 5, the justices made it more difficult for
minorities to prove statistically that they are being relegated to
less desirable jobs.
   Ray Fitzpatrick, an attorney representing the white firemen in
Birmingham, said Monday's ruling is a step toward ending
``race-based quota promotions'' that unfairly discriminate against
whites.
   ``In our view the one-for-one black and white promotions that
Birmingham has been following for eight years are not legal under
the U.S. Constitution,'' Fitzpatrick said today on ``CBS This
Morning.'' ``... They're excessive. The black population at the
firefighter entry level is about 10 to 13 percent, yet 50 percent of
the promotions are going to blacks.''
   Civil rights and women's groups, however, say they may ask
Congress to reverse the high court rulings.
   ``I think a legislative remedy is something that is probably
going to be pursued,'' said Judith Winston, a lawyer for the Women's
Legal Defense Fund,
   ``The time may have come to again go to the Congress and attempt
to get the Congress to overrule what the court has done in the civil
rights area,'' said Patrick Patterson of the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund in Los Angeles.
   ``I think it is indispensable at this point that the battle be
taken to Congress,'' said Galloway, who specializes in affirmative
action law.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil rights, said he was saddened by the court's
decision and added, ``We'll have to take a look at it'' with an eye
to possible legislation.
   ``This decision will open old wounds and create unfortunate new
levels of racial animosity,'' Edwards said.
   Already, he said, his staff has been meeting with civil rights
groups and professors about the June 5 decision. He said legislation
would be introduced and hearings probably held soon.
   The last major congressional debate on civil rights was touched
off by a high court decision in 1984 that placed limits on laws
barring federal aid to schools and other institutions that
discriminate. Legislation restoring the original broader
interpretation of the laws was passed over former President Reagan's
veto last year after a long struggle.
   President Bush so far has been noncommittal on the issue of
affirmative action, which was strongly opposed by Reagan. After the
court's June 5 decision on statistical evidence, Bush said in
response to a question that the ruling was still being studied but
``sometimes you can ... take remedy in suggested legislation.''
   Some observers said they think Bush might be more amenable than
Reagan was to legislative action in the civil rights field.
   ``I think the Bush administration is more concerned about
reaching out to the black community than the past administration
was,'' said T. Alexander Aleinikoff, a professor at the University
of Michigan Law School who follows civil rights cases closely.
   Said Santa Clara University's Galloway: ``They haven't taken a
clear stance on affirmative action yet, but I hope they may be
somewhat more moderate.''

<HEAD>Army Destroys House, Seals Three Others in West Bank</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army said it blew up a house in the West
Bank today and sealed two others in a crackdown on Palestinians
suspected of throwing firebombs at troops and attacking Arabs who
cooperate with Israel.
   Another house was sealed near Nablus because concrete blocks were
thrown at soliders from its roof, the army said.
   Arab reports said four other houses also were sealed during an
arrest sweep in which 49 suspects were arrested in Nablus, the West
Bank's largest city. The army refused to confirm those sealings but
acknowledged the arrests.
   The United States and human rights organizations have condemned
house demolitions, saying they deny people due process under the law
since suspects rarely are tried before the demolitions.
   The West Bank human rights group Al-Haq, Law in the Service of
Man, said the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in
the West Bank and 58 in the Gaza Strip since the December 1987 start
of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the
territories.
   Also today, Arab hospital officials said a Palestinian teen-ager
from the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank was shot and wounded
by soldiers in a clash late Monday night.
   The army said two houses were sealed in the village of Samu,
south of the town of Hebron, and one house was destroyed in the
nearby village of Beit Ummar.
   It said Palestinians living in the houses were part of a strike
force that attacked alleged Arabs collaborators. They also threw
stones and firebombs at army patrols and set up roadblocks on a
highway near the village, the army said.
   The other house sealed was in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus.
The army said Palestinians tried to throw building blocks on
soldiers from the home's roof two months ago.
   An army spokesman, who is not identified under military
regulations, was unable to say what connection the attackers had to
that house. He said soldiers were slightly hurt in the incidents,
but gave no details.
   The military said in a statement that the 49 Palestinians from
Nablus were arrested on suspicion of throwing fire bombs at a
government office, an Israeli bank and an army patrol. The statement
said they were members of a group tied to Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing
of the PLO.
   The Arab manager of Bank Leumi in Nablus was seriously wounded in
the attack on the bank, the army said.
   Also today, a spokesman for the military administration in the
Gaza Strip confirmed a report in the Haaretz newspaper that the army
has been compensating alleged Arab collaborators who are injured or
have property damaged in attacks by other Palestinians.
   The underground leadership of the uprising has repeatedly called
for the death of collaborators and 50 have been killed since the
start of the revolt.

<HEAD>County Lawsuit Asks $13 Million For Soundproofing Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEATON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   DuPage County is suing Chicago and six
airlines for $13 million to soundproof schools against jet noise
from O'Hare International Airport.
   ``Students' rights have been adversely affected in that verbal
presentations in class have been interrupted as a result of
excessive jet noises,'' said State's Attorney James Ryan, who filed
the lawsuit Monday.
   The county wants the city and the airlines to pay for
soundproofing 22 schools in O'Hare flight paths. Eleven of the
schools already have been soundproofed.
   Noise levels at the schools don't exceed the 70-decibel level set
by the Federal Aviation Administration and city officials, but Ryan
said that level is too high and that the city and the airlines have
failed to correct the problem.
   The airlines named in the lawsuit are American, Delta, Northwest,
Trans World, United and USAir.
   United and American, the two largest carriers at O'Hare, declined
to comment, as did attorneys for the city.
   Students and teachers in Bensenville observe a 20-second pause
whenever jet noise disrupts classes, Superintendent Ken Kaufman said.
   ``We call it the Bensenville pause,'' said Kaufman.
   The U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to hear an appeal of a
case involving noise and pollution complaints at O'Hare, effectively
clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages for noise at the
airport.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a broad declaration today that
calls for a 50 percent reduction in nuclear arsenals and a worldwide
ban on chemical weapons.
   The document on common principles of both nations was signed on
the second day of the Soviet leader's first state visit to West
Germany.
   The pact signed by Kohl and Gorbachev said their countries have a
common European heritage, and that European nations should exist in
``peaceful competition with one another'' and reduce their military
might.
   It also said cooperation by West Germany and the Soviet Union
``is not directed against anyone'' and that a special place in the
``common European home'' is reserved for the United States and
Canada.
   Asked if the agreement could help resolve territorial questions
stirred by the 1939 non-aggression pact signed by Adolf Hitler and
Josef Stalin _ which allowed the Soviet Union to annex three
independent Baltic states _ Gorbachev told The Associated Press: ``I
don't think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of history.''
   He said the joint agreement was to formalize the wish of both
Moscow and Bonn to enter ``a new stage in our relations.''
   The signing ceremony was carried live on West German television.
   The two nations appealed for a 50 percent reduction in the
strategic nuclear arsenal of the superpowers and a reduction in
conventional armies and weapons ``in all of Europe.''
   The document called for a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, a
treaty banning nuclear tests and the preservation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   That accord, signed by both superpowers, is seen by the Soviets
and West Germans as a document banning the development of ``Star
Wars'' space defenses advocated by President Bush's predecessor,
Ronald Reagan.
   The document signed today also stressed the importance of respect
for human rights, cultural contacts and youth exchanges for
promoting lasting peace.
   The Soviets and West Germans also signed 11 other agreements,
including pacts to establish a ``hot line'' between Bonn and the
Kremlin, and to increase educational and youth exchanges.
   Earlier, Gorbachev received a rapturous reception that
outstripped the welcome given two weeks ago to Bush, who scores far
below the Soviet leader in West German opinion polls.
   When Gorbachev arrived in this key NATO country on Monday, he
declared that Moscow and Bonn had begun ``a new chapter'' in
relations that could bring a new era of peace to the continent. He
also welcomed U.S. proposals to reduce conventional forces on the
continent, saying they offer chances for speedy agreement.
   Outside Bonn's 18th-century Town Hall today, a crowd chanted
``Gorby! Gorby!'' and waved dozens of Soviet flags.
   ``A Soviet leader surrounded by cheering West Germans, who would
have thought of that a few years ago?'' exclaimed a television
commentator during a live national broadcast.
   Other banners reflected the German pain at the postwar division
of their nation and of the former capital, Berlin, telling Gorbachev
``German unity _ peace in Europe'' and, in English, ``Gorby, make
love not walls.''
   No German needs to be reminded of the Berlin Wall.
   Most of the crowd cheered Gorbachev but many hooted disapproval
when Mayor Hans Daniels, in a brief speech before a ceremonial
exchange of gifts, referred to Bonn as only the temporary capital of
Germany, ``substituting for Berlin.''
   Gorbachev proposed Monday that West Germany and the Soviet Union
combat pollution and exchange technology and emergency assistance in
case of an environmental disaster.
   And in a gesture of reconciliation, the Soviet Union released the
names of 1,500 German soldiers who died in its prisoner-of-war camps
during World War II. It was the first time the Soviets had provided
a list of German soldiers still unaccounted for after the war, West
German officials said.
   At a formal dinner Monday night, Gorbachev said the Soviets were
pleased that the West has responded to some Warsaw Pact suggestions
in Bush's arms control proposal last month, which links short-range
nuclear missile reductions to swift and substantial cuts in
conventional forces.
   ``There is now reason to presume that an agreement in Vienna
(conventional arms talks) can be reached much more quickly than was
expected earlier,'' he said.
   Gorbachev stressed, however, that the Kremlin still wants
separate talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Bush has pushed for progress on conventional arms before short-range
missiles are addressed.
   Kohl appealed to Gorbachev for the Kremlin to make a unilateral
cut in short-range nuclear missiles. The Soviets concede that the
Warsaw Pact has an advantage in short-range forces in Europe.
   Gorbachev said the Warsaw Pact would wait until a meeting of its
leaders, expected next month, to give a detailed response to Bush's
proposals for substantial cuts in East-bloc and Western armies in
Europe by the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has sued on behalf of a state Supreme Court justice who
is challenging the Vermont Constitution's requirement that judges
retire at age 70.
   Justice Louis Peck turned 70 in December but refused to retire.
He maintains that the requirement violates the federal ban on age
discrimination.
   After several lawyers questioned Peck's right to hear cases, the
administrator of Vermont's courts put him on retirement status
effective June 30. Peck filed a complaint with the EEOC, which sued
in federal court late last week.
   The state hired an outside lawyer to represent it because the
state attorney general has sided with Peck.
   U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi, who is himself 70, has told
the parties he hopes to decide the case by June 30, Gray said.
   Gagliardi is one of roughly 300 federal judges on senior status.
They are semi-retired, determine their own workload and handle about
15 percent of federal cases. Federal judges can take senior status
as early as age 65.
   About a dozen states have mandatory retirement for judges.
   A federal appeals court in Massachusetts has upheld that state's
provision, saying Congress did not mean for the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act to apply to appointed state judges. But courts in
other states have disagreed.

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman released internal
Energy Department documents that he said raised new doubts about the
department's plan to open the nation's first permanent nuclear waste
dump in the New Mexico desert.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., questioned how the department could
meet its September target date for opening the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant, a $700 million underground facility designed to entomb wastes
from the manufacture of nuclear weapons contaminated with plutonium,
which remains radioactive for 24,000 years.
   At a meeting Monday of the House subcommittee on environment,
energy and natural resources, Synar said the department was
``inviting failure'' by trying to overcome all the technical hurdles
to opening the facility by September.
   He suggested that it would be safer to put off the opening for
some months.
   The repository, situated near Carlsbad, N.M., originally was to
open last October. It was put off because of delays in verifying
that the design and construction are sound.
   Synar made public internal memorandums from Energy Department
safety officers that he said indicated the department still was
unable to provide assurances on the design and construction.
   A memo dated June 1, from James P. Knight, director of the
department's office of safety appraisals, said ``significant
additional effort in ongoing staffing, training, procedure
development and documentation is necessary'' before the department
could approve opening the facility.
   A similar note of caution was sounded by Keith O. Fultz, a
General Accounting Office official who told the subcommittee hearing
that his agency's review of the waste dump plan indicated the
department ``has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key issues.''
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, in a statement issued June 3,
said he still expected to open the waste dump in September for its
5-year experimental and test period.
   Watkins cautioned against ``inaccurate public alarm'' about
progress at the waste site.

   A defecting Afghan army officer who
claims he had access to top-level security records said today that a
Soviet general is President Najib's top adviser.
   ``His name is Gen. Verinikov. He is a three-star general. He
comes every day without failure to the headquarters meeting in Arg
Palace and whatever he says is never rejected,'' Mohammad Kakar Neda
told a news conference.
   In Moscow, an officer at the Soviet Defense Ministry said the
general had served as Najib's military adviser but left Kabul in
February when the Soviet Union announced that the last of its troops
had returned home from Afghanistan.
   ``Since the withdrawal of our forces, he's been here in Moscow
and he hasn't been advising anyone,'' the officer said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He identified the general as Valentin I. Varenikov, a different
spelling than the one given by Neda, and said he had ``one big
star,'' denoting a higher rank than the three stars described by
Neda. The officer said Varenikov was now the main commander of
Soviet land forces.
   Neda, who can be located only through intermediaries because he
said he is concerned about his safety, could not be contacted
immediately for further comment.
   Western and Afghan observers in Kabul have said scores of Soviet
advisers, both military and civilian, remain in Afghanistan.
   A well-placed source said that a Soviet colonel was seen at Kabul
airport in March. When recognized, the colonel said he had retired
from the military and returned to Kabul as a civilian adviser, the
source said on condition of anonymity.
   Neda said he himself was promoted to brigadier general shortly
before coming to New Delhi on March 23.
   He said he served as secretary to the Afghan Supreme Military
Council for the Defense of the Homeland, a 20-man group headed by
Najib.
   The council assumed top government authority when Najib declared
a state of emergency on Feb. 18, three days after the Soviet Union
announced it had ended its nine years of direct combat support for
the Afghan army in the war against U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   ``Najib's support in the party is not very good, and if he did
not have Soviets attached to him, he would not be able to survive,''
Neda said. ``Right now he has a very strong Soviet support group,
and with this group is Gen. Verinikov.''
   Neda said he had never heard the Soviet general's first name but
had seen him and knew that he met top Afghan military officials.
   Neda said he also had seen Afghan military documents that said
40,000 soldiers defected from the 250,000-man army between Sept. 1
and March 1.
   Other papers reaching the council said Najib's government had
``nominal control'' of just 4,000 of Afghanistan's officially
recorded 36,000 villages and 10,000 other villages were ``destroyed
and uninhabitable'' after a decade of civil war, Neda said.
   The rest of the villages, he added, were controlled by or
sympathetic to the mujahedeen (Islamic Holy Warriors) who have been
fighting to topple Kabul's Soviet-style government for the past
decade.
   Neda said he was a full member of the Supreme Military Council.
His name, however, was not on the list of members announced by the
government in February.
   ``That is correct,'' he said in response to a reporter's
question. ``In the beginning of March, I was promoted to this post.''
   His assertion could not be independently confirmed, but the Kabul
government has a history of making appointments without public
announcement.
   Neda said he had been one of four secretaries attached to the
Supreme Defense Council and was elevated to full council membership
as a result of long-time association with Vice President Abdul Rahim
Hatif, a senior council member.
   The 47-year-old Neda said he was not a combat soldier and had
spent most of his military career in engineering and construction
work before rising in the military bureaucracy.
   Neda's remarks were translated by Said Mohammad Maiwand, a
self-exiled Afghan who opposes the Najib government and is at odds
with most mujahedeen factions as well.
   Neda, however, understood some English and said he spent part of
1978 in the United States on a military training course, studying
English at San Antonio and engineering at Fort Belvoir, Va.

   Vietnam told a U.N. conference today that it needs
money from other nations to stem the exodus of people fleeing the
country, and the United States said it would accept more of the boat
people.
   The conference, attended by 60 countries, is expected to endorse
a proposal to reduce the number of Vietnamese leaving their country
for economic reasons and to promote regular emigration programs.
   The plan will include screening procedures for all new arrivals
in Southeast Asian coastal states to determine whether they are
fleeing political persecution. If they are, they will be eligible
for refugee status and resettlement.
   The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Lawrence S. Eagleburger,
announced that over the next three years the United States will
accept 22,000 of the 55,000 Vietnamese now in refugee camps. In
addition, the United States anticipates accepting up to half of all
new arrivals granted refugee status, he said.
   Vietnamese officials called on the United States to accept more
refugees, but it was not immediately clear if Vietnamese officials
were satisfied with the U.S. commitment.
   The number of boat people declined in the early 1980s, but the
exodus has accelerated again. Almost 90,000 Vietnamese, three times
the 1986 total, now are living in refugee camps assisted by the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
   Another 100,000 refugees from Cambodia and Laos live in the camps.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said today that 43 Vietnamese
refugees, rescued by a United Arab Emirates tanker in the South
China Sea on June 4, arrived today at Tomakomai, a port on Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said ``fair
international mechanisms must be found'' to deal with boat people
``while preserving the universal respect _ and preventing the abuse
of _ the principle of asylum.''
   Jean-Pierre Hocke, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said
the growing number of asylum seekers has caused an ``acute crisis''
in Hong Kong and poses a burden for other coastal state destinations
of boat people.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said one way to stop
the exodus would be to grant international assistance to regions of
his country that face serious economic difficulties ``and where
illegal departures take place.''
   He said Vietnam opposes the return of boat people who have been
denied refugee status, as urged by some countries.
   Eagleburger also said the United States will remain oppposed to
forcing Vietnamese refugees to return home ``unless and until
dramatic improvements occur in that country's economic, social and
political life.''
   Australia will take up to 11,000 Vietnamese now in camps and a
``generous proportion'' of new arrivals, provided other countries
also participate in the U.N. plan, said Foreign Minister Gareth
Evans.

<HEAD>Uzbek Party Chief Apologizes to Minority Turks for Violence</HEAD>

   The Communist Party chief in Uzbekistan apologized
today to Meshki Turks for violence directed at them during 10 days
of rioting, arson and killings in the republic, Tass reported today.
   The state-run news agency said party chief Rafik Nishanov made
the apology on behalf of the people of the Central Asian republic
during a visit to a temporary camp for Meshki Turk refugees.
   Much of the violence that has swept the Fergana Valley in the
republic, about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, was perpetrated by
the majority Uzbeks on the ethnic Turkish minority, according to
official news reports.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Boris Mikhailov said 90 people,
including a police officer, had been killed and that 974 people had
been injured. Earlier press reports put the death toll at 100.
   Mikhailov also said 748 houses were burned down and that 28
buildings of ``economic significance'' were torched.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today played down the role
of ethnic strife in the violence.
   ``There's something altogether different going on there,''
Gorbachev said in Bonn, West Germany, where is on a four-day state
visit. `It's not so much inter-ethnic conflict as a kind of crude
fundamentalism. But we must look at the problem more closely.''
   It was not clear if he was referring to Moslem fundamentalism.
The Uzbeks and the Meshki Turks are Moslems.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov
and Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin accompanied Nishanov to the
refugee camp, Tass said.
   The Kremlin had dispatched them to investigate the disturbances
on the spot.
   ``All measures for liquidating the circumstances of the Fergana
events will be taken and those guilty of crimes will be found and
punished in accordance with all Soviet laws,'' Ryzhkov said.
   Thousands of Meshki Turks, forcibly resettled in Uzbekistan from
their homeland in Soviet Georgia by the late dictator Josef Stalin
in 1944, have been evacuated because of the violence to central
Russia and the neighboring republics of Kazakhstan and Tadjikistan,
Soviet media reported.
   Tension remained in Uzbekistan and security troops were prepared
to quell further violence, Soviet officials and state-run media said.
   Panicky rumors can ``be the detonator of the next explosion with
unpredictable consequences,'' the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   ``Mobile units are ready, helicopters are in the airport ready at
any time,'' said Pravda, the Communist Party daily.
   More than 11,000 troops, mainly from the Interior Ministry,
continued to patrol the area, a ministry spokesman said.
   Mikhailov said criminal charges were being brought in 30 cases
and that 557 people had been detained for participating in violenct
acts. More than 1,000 people were detained for violating curfew but
were later released.
   Mikhailov said authorities had confiscated 5,561 weapons, most of
them hunting weapons and knives. The popoulation has been asked to
turn in weapons voluntarily to keep them out of the hands of
``extremists,'' he said.
   Telephone calls to the area could not be put through Tuesday
because lines were down, an operator said.

<HEAD>Uno Cabinet Receives Lowest Initial Public Support Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno refused again today to
answer questions by opposition lawmakers about a geisha who
reportedly claimed she was paid to be his mistress.
   A poll, meanwhile, showed his Cabinet had one of the worst
ratings of any new Japanese government.
   In an upper house Budget Committee session, lawmakers questioned
Uno for a third day about a weekly magazine's report quoting an
unidentified 40-year-old woman as saying Uno paid her about $2,100 a
month for four months in 1985 to be his mistress.
   Socialist Party member Keiko Chiba asked for an explanation and
said Uno's ``vague attitude'' would jeopardize international trust
in Japan when he attends the Paris meeting of major industrial
democracies next month.
   Uno replied only that he would try to be worthy of being ``the
sole representative from among Asian countries, and one of the
advanced countries,'' at the forum.
   The report about the geisha was not covered by the poll on Uno
and his Cabinet, conducted Friday and Saturday by the national
newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
   The Asahi said only 28 percent of those questioned in its
nationwide poll supported the Cabinet, tying the previous low for a
new Cabinet, that of Takeo Fukuda in 1977.
   The Asahi said the poor rating reflected public dissatisfaction
with Uno's initial efforts at political reform in response to the
Recruit influence-peddling scandal. The scandal involved dozens of
prominent political figures and forced Uno's predecessor, Noboru
Takeshita, to resign.
   Shortly before he left the prime minister post, Takeshita's
approval rating had fallen below 4 percent in some polls.
   Uno, 66, who was foreign minister under Takeshita, took office as
prime minister on June 3 after the governing Liberal Democratic
Party chose him as its new leader because of his clean image. The
geisha reports came later.
   The Asahi also said 44 percent of the 2,379 adults questioned in
the poll indicated they opposed Uno's Cabinet _ the highest
non-support rate for any new Cabinet in the 34 years the Liberal
Democrats have been Japan's dominant party.
   The Asahi did not give a margin of error for the poll.
   It said 73 percent of the respondents wanted Uno to dissolve the
House of Representatives and call new general elections ``as early
as possible.'' Another 13 percent opposed such a move, the newspaper
said.
   Opposition party leaders have called for early elections as a way
for the voters to judge the ruling party's handling of the
influence-peddling scandal.
   Prosecutors say that about 160 influential politicians,
businessmen and bureaucrats were offered bargain-priced unlisted
shares in a real estate subsidiary of Recruit Co., an
information-publishing giant. Purchasers reaped handsome profits by
selling the shares after they went public in October 1986.

<HEAD>Congress Told Commercialization of Research Threatens Institutions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercialization of biomedical research in
American universities is threatening the integrity of scientific
institutions, a congressional panel was told today.
   Sheldon Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental
policy at Tufts University, testified before the human resources
sucommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations.
   ``There have been changes in the social norms and values of
biomedical scientists and their academic institutions,'' Krimsky
said. ``I believe some of these changes are detrimental to the
general well-being of basic science and to the public interest.''
   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within
universities over a relatively short period of time,'' he said. ``I
have heard it said within the scientific community that everyone
gains from this marriage of academia and commerce. Nothing can be
further from the truth.
   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public
confidence in science.''
   He called for disclosure of financial interests related to
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants.
   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University and a
founding member of the National Coalition for Universities in the
Public Interest, said universy researchers ``are free to make
undisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which they
often have equally undisclosed personal roles.''
   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in
research and many have done so,'' he said.
   Noble said collaboration between universities and industries may
be useful but should be accompanied by ``proper disclosure and
procedural safeguards.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said, ``I
am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or
manipulated for personal gain.''
   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican member
of the panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the
research community that scientific misconduct will not be
tolerated.''
   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struck
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way
of overall progress.''

   A rash of accidental shootings of
children by children is being blamed on Florida's liberal gun law
and is renewing a push for legislation against leaving guns within
reach of a youngster.
   Five shootings since June 1 involving children playing with guns
at home have left two youngsters dead and one near death today.
   Gov. Bob Martinez on Monday said he will consider adding gun
legislation to the agenda of a special summer session he wants to
call on transportation matters.
   ``There's been a series of tragic accidents here that has the
people of Florida very concerned,'' said Martinez.
   Under a bill proposed earlier this month by Rep. Harry Jennings,
leaving a firearm in reach of a child would be a misdemeanor. It
would be a felony carrying up to five years in prison if a child
died or was maimed.
   The bill, which borrows language from the state's
abandoned-refrigerator law, would require that guns be secured with
a trigger lock or kept in a locked container.
   A spokeswoman for the Rifle Association said the group would not
oppose the bill if were amended to exclude shootings involving guns
stolen from a home, but she said the law would be superfluous.
   ``We have laws on our books now that deal with child
endangerment, negligence, culpable negligence and criminal
negligence and there is recourse in the civil courts,'' said Marion
Hammer.
   Jennings said much of the problem results from Florida's 1987 gun
law, which all but eliminated cooling-off periods for purchases,
banned local gun-control ordinances and allowed most Floridians to
carry a concealed weapon.
   Jennings' measure passed in the House during the recently
completed regular session, but the Senate didn't take it up. On
Monday, Senate President Bob Crawford said he would like to see the
bill included in a special session.
   ``Anything that would encourage the family to be more aware of
the dangers of leaving loaded guns in that setting ... I'd be
willing to work with you on that,'' he said.
   Some lawmakers expressed reservations.
   ``You can't legislate against all tragedy,'' said Rep. Lois
Frankel. ``Why would the threat of going to jail be any more a
deterrent to carelessness than having your child killed?''
   The latest shooting victim, 4-year-old Silvio Pierre, was listed
in very critical condition today at Tampa General Hospital. He had
found his father's .25-caliber pistol under a living room chair
Sunday, police said.
   No statewide statistics on such accidents are kept, said Linda
Booz, information specialist for the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement.

   Sen. Jack Gordon, a liberal leader in the
Legislature, today became the first Democrat to enter the race for
the congressional seat left vacant by the death of Claude Pepper.
   Gordon, 67, of Miami Beach pledged to uphold Pepper's ideals.
Pepper, who died May 30 at age 88, was an old-style liberal who won
14 terms in a House district increasingly dominated by conservative
Hispanics.
   ``I think Claude Pepper deserves a successor that shares the same
concerns that he did,'' said Gordon, who was first elected to the
state Senate in 1972.
   Some Democratic leaders have expressed concern about Gordon's
ability to attract Hispanic voters in the special election on Aug.
29. But Democrats also have said they hope to avoid a divisive
primary Aug. 1.
   Cuban-born Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, a Democrat, said today he
will wait until Monday to decide whether to enter the race. He has
indicated reluctance to oppose Gordon.
   Two conservative Cuban-American Republicans, state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and businessman Carlos Perez, announced their
candidacies last week in the district, which is 40 percent to 50
percent Hispanic.
   Jeff Allen, a black lawyer, also has announced a Republican
candidacy.
   Gordon has opposed U.S. military aid to Nicaragua's Contras, a
popular cause among Miami's Cuban and Nicaraguan exile communities.
He expressed confidence that he could win Hispanic votes because of
his support of social-service programs.
   Gordon is married to Myra MacPherson, a Washington Post staff
writer and author.

   Hungary's ruling Communist Party and
nine opposition groups opened landmark talks today on the terms of
holding the first multi-party elections since the communists came to
power in 1948.
   The meeting comes four weeks after Poland had its freest and most
competitive elections under communist rule.
   The Hungarian talks are to set the stage for free elections that
will be held by mid-1990 at the latest.
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz told the evening daily Esti
Hirlap today that the talks mark ``an important step'' in the
party's development since a party conference in May 1988, when Grosz
replaced longtime party leader Janos Kadar and avid reformers were
brought into the party leadership.
   He led the Communist Party's delegation, which also included
Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay and Gyoergy Fejti, who has been in
charge of preliminary exchanges with the opposition.
   Peter Toelgyessy, a spokesman, was quoted by the paper as saying
the opposition's aim at the talks was to lead the country to the
first free elections.
   ``We don't want to make final decisions above the people's
heads,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We want to use the negotiations
to decide the rules to be followed in the democratic transition.''
   The talks were opened by parliament speaker Matyas Szueros, who
presided over the opening round in Budapest's ornate parliament
building and briefly addressed the negotiators.
   In an earlier statement, Szueroes said the talks would probably
be ``decisive for the direction and speed'' of transformation to a
multi-party system, the state news agency MTI reported.
   The government and opposition on Saturday agreed to hold the
talks.
   Also participating are the official trade unions and the
left-wing Ferenc Muennich Society, which opposes a change in the
one-party system. The nine opposition groups initially wanted the
Communist Party organizations left out of the meetings but later
agreed to their participation.
   Budapest's party chief, Mihaly Jasso, in an interview published
today warned of a possible split within the party brought on by
reforms. He said in the case of a split, the party would likely
``fall to pieces.''
   Communist Party leader Grosz told a weekend meeting of communists
in the city of Gyoer that a ``real danger'' of a split exists.
   Grosz said there were differences among party factions over the
pace of reforms and Hungary's foreign policy orientation.

<UNK>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Further Restricted Under Emergency</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today further
restricted the movements of anti-apartheid leaders and prevented
them from participating in peace talks to end factional fighting in
Zululand.
   More than 500 people have received restriction orders that
interfere with their freedom of movement and prohibit them from
addressing public meetings or being quoted in the press, the
Ministry of Law and Order said.
   And many were further restricted after President P.W. Botha
renewed the 4-year-old state of emergency on Friday.
   Those included members of the United Democratic Front, which had
scheduled peace talks this week in Natal Province to end factional
fighting among anti-apartheid groups that has left 1,500 dead since
1986.
   ``We cannot interpret this as anything other than a deliberate
attempt to perpetuate the divisions which have caused such frightful
bloodshed in Natal,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Govan Mbeki, 79, an official with the African National Congress,
the main South African guerrilla organization, today was restricted
to his apartment from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. He had already been banned
from speaking to the press, addressing public gatherings and leaving
the New Brighton township without permission.
   The restrictions will stop him from participating in the United
Democratic Front peace talks with the Zulu group, Inkatha.
   On Monday, Archie Gumede, 75, a co-president of the United
Democratic Front in Natal was placed under house arrest from 8 pm.
to 5 a.m. daily. He was already prohibited from talking to the
press, addressing public gatherings, or helping to prepare material
for publication.
   The Front's other co-president, Albertina Sisulu, is under
similar restrictions, as are most executive members of the
anti-apartheid coalition.
   The group's leaders have frequently accused police of trying to
sabotage the peace talks and of encouraging violence in the Natal
townships rather than trying to subdue it.
   ``For more than 18 months Natal and national church leaders have
been trying to bring to an end the conflict between political rivals
in the province,'' Tutu said. `` During this period the government
has acted only to hamper the process, never to help it.

   Thousands of ethnic Turks deported from
Bulgaria have poured across the border in the past three weeks,
leaving behind what they say is a nightmare of government
persecution, officials said today.
   Since May 26, when Bulgaria started the deportations, the number
of arrivals has reached 16,297, the foreign ministry said today.
Tent cities are being erected in a hurry.
   ``As if they (the Bulgarians) are trying to test the strength and
power of the Turkish state, they are sending wave after wave of
people to the border,'' Cabinet minister Ercument Konukman told
reporters.
   Publicly, Premier Turgut Ozal has said Turkey will accept all
deported ethnic Turks. But officials say Turkey's resources will be
severely strained if the forced exodus from Bulgaria continues.
   The present wave of immigration comes at a time when Turkey is
hard pressed with other refugee problems.
   In August, 50,000 Kurds fleeing Iraqi attacks crossed the border
into Turkey. About 35,000 of them remain, housed in tent cities and
crowded apartment buildings in southeastern Turkey.
   According to official estimates, Turkey is also home to 600,000
Iranians who fled the Islamic revolution or the war with Iraq and
settled in Turkish cities, principally Istanbul.
   Bulgaria began deporting ethnic Turks after unrest in the
northeastern and southern regions last month. Many deported led
resistance to a forced assimilation campaign that began in 1983 and
includes changing ethnic Turks Moslem names to Slavic ones.
   Also under the campaign, Sofia barred the public use of the
Turkish language and practice of Islamic religious rites.
   Deportees said police attacked ethnic Turks at late May
demonstrations against the campaign with dogs and clubs, killing
about 40 people.
   Turkey has proposed negotiations with Bulgaria to hammer out an
immigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose of
their property and bring out liquid assets. Deportees have said they
were not allowed to take with them more than a suitcase.
   Bulgaria claims the Moslem minority numbers 780,000 while Turkish
officials put it at 2.5 million in the total population of 9 million.
   Through defections and immigration agreements, 380,00 ethnic
Turks have come to Turkey since 1925.

<DATELINE>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, standing
against the backdrop of the majestic Grand Tetons, declared today
that ``environmental gridlock must end'' and appealed to the public
and Congress to unite behind his plan to clean America's polluted
air.
   Invoking the memories of past presidents who created the national
parks, Bush said his clean air initiative marks ``a new chapter in
the tradiion of protecting our people and their parks.''
   He made the remarks in a speech at the Teton Science School, an
outdoor education center located inside this 310,000-acre
mountainous preserve. Bush spoke on a brilliant morning in a field
where bison roam in the winter, with the 13,770-foot Grand Teton
mountain behind him in the distance, the tallest peak in the
40-mile, snow-capped range.
   Bush, who visited the still-blackened expanse of Yellowstone
National Park before arriving here Monday for an evening of fishing
with his grandson, said ``nature needs our help.''
   ``Today, with my back to the Pacific and the jewels of the
American Rockies, I look east across this fertile and productive
land and call on the American people _ and on Congress _ to join me
in this new initiative for clean air,'' said Bush, an avid
outdoorsman who has treked through the Tetons in the past.
   Recalling his meetings with environmental and industry groups
before putting the finishing touches on the package he unveiled
Monday, Bush said, ``No group is going to get everything it wants.
Some say we're asking too much, too fast. Others say not enough, too
slow.''
   But now, he said, ``there's one thing everyone agrees on: we need
action. And we need it now.
   ``Every American deserves to breath clean air. And you shouldn't
have to drive two thousand miles here to do it. Environmental
gridlock must end,'' he declared.
   National Park Service police removed several demonstrators from
the site before Bush arrived. They had signs denouncing Bush's
handling of the Valdez oil spill. Jim Northup of the National Park
Service said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national park
without a permit. They were taken to Teton County Jail.
   Bush also announced he is nominating Wyoming State Sen. John
Turner as director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Turner, a
past Senate president, and his family own Triangle X dude ranch in
Grand Teton park.
   Bush said, ``Creating national parks was an American idea ... and
it was one of our best.'' From Abraham Lincoln, who granted Yosemite
Valley to California, to Teddy Roosevelt, who made the environment a
hallmark of his presidency, past presidents have done their part to
help Americans enjoy their natural heritage, Bush said.
   His new plan is aimed at improving and preserving ``the very air
we breathe ... for another five generations and beyond,'' Bush said.
   Even the Tetons, ``the heart of an environmental success
story...cannot escape the threat of pollution,'' he said.
   ``It can follow you here. But the good news is, we're not going
to put up with it any longer,'' he said.
   Later, Bush was flying to Lincoln, Neb., to underscore his
support for alternative fuels research.
   Earlier, in the East Room of the White House, Bush had unveiled a
clean air package that he promised would cut acid rain-causing
sulfur dioxide emissions in half by the year 2000.
   The initiative drew applause from industrialists,
environmentalists and lawmakers alike _ with some reservations.
   Environmental leaders hailed his stance on acid rain, but
questioned whether the plan was tough enough on smog and toxic
industrial pollutants.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and coal lobbyists said it would put
high-sulfur coal areas at a disadvantage.
   Bush promised that his legislative package ``will be
cost-effective, but above all, it will work. We will make the 1990s
the era for clean air.''
   With a nod to Congress _ but not a word about his predecessor
Ronald Reagan's failure to press the topic _ Bush said, ``We've seen
enough of this stalemate. It's time to clear the air. And you know,
I think we will.''
   The president is banking on the sale of 1 million
methanol-powered cars a year by 1997 to help rid America's big
cities of smog.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters on Air
Force One that Bush hopes to sign a clean air bill ``by the fall.''
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly
estimated the overall program would cost between $14 billion and $19
billion a year after it is in full effect at the turn of the century.
   Sununu said the stiffer standards would add 5 to 10 percent to
utility rates in 18 states that burn high sulfur coal and contribute
the most to the acid rain problem. But he said their rates would
still fall below the national average.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Extension of Tax Breaks for Certain Employers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Ways and Means subcommittee today
approved extension of expiring tax benefits for employers who hire
disadvantaged workers and for those who invest in low-income housing.
   The revenue subcommittee also renewed a tax credit that
encourages rehabilitation of old buildings and approved a major
simplification of the corporate minimum tax.
   The four measures now go to the full Ways and Means Committee,
whether they face further scrutiny. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the subcommittee on select revenue measures, emphasized
that the minimum-tax bill almost certainly will be modified by the
parent panel.
   The bills would:
   _Extend through 1992 the targeted-jobs tax credit, under which
the government, in effect, pays up to $2,400 of the first-year wages
paid economically disadvantaged workers, especially Vietnam-era
veterans and those aged 18 through 22. This would cost the
government $647 million over the next five years.
   _Renew through 1992, with some modifications, the credit for
investment in housing for low-income Americans. This would cost more
than $3 billion over five years.
   _Extend through 1992, at a cost of $145 million, a credit for
rehabilitation of historic and other older buildings. The credit is
for 10 percent of costs associated with non-residential buildings
built before 1936 and 20 percent for rehabilitation of certified
historic structures.
   _Drop one complex step, involving ``adjusted current earnings,''
from the calculations by which corporations determine their
liability for the minimum tax. Aides said the version approved by
the subcommittee avoids all but $100 million of the five-year $4.2
billion revenue loss that had been estimated for the original bill,
sponsored by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.

   Final preparations began this morning for
the first atomic chain reaction at the long-delayed Seabrook nuclear
plant.
   ``We would be in position for first fission to occur late this
afternoon or early this evening,'' plant spokesman Ron Sher said.
   The $6 billion reactor won a low-power testing license last month
after years of delay and protests that made the plant a symbol of
anti-nuclear activism and forced its chief owner into bankruptcy
court.
   Plant officials hope to win a commercial license by the end of
the year.
   Plant officials had hoped to start atomic operations as early as
a week ago but were stymied by a malfunctioning valve in the
emergency cooling system. The system's valves worked properly in
tests early Monday, Sher said.

   Britain will do all it can to stop the poaching of
Africa's endangered black rhinoceroses, Environment Minister Lord
Caithness said Tuesday.
   But he also called on individuals to help end the illegal trade
in rhinoceros horns.
   ``We will certainly do at the government level what we can
because this is a very serious question,'' Caithness said at the
launch of an appeal fund for the charity Rhino Rescue. ``A
government can only do a certain amount. People pressure, rather
than government pressure, is the solution.''
   Caithness gave no specific examples of what the government would
do.
   The black rhino is threatened because poachers can sell a single
horn for as much as $25,000.
   The horns are used as traditional medicines and aphrodisiacs in
Asia and as ceremonial dagger handles in the Middle East.
   Only about 4,000 black rhinos remain in Africa, compared with an
estimated 65,000 in 1970.

<TEXT>
   From Charlie Chaplin and Ginger
Rogers to Steven Spielberg and Robert Redford, some of Hollywood's
most sacred heroes and villains drew large crowds for three weeks in
this film-loving capital.
   Nearly 100,000 people flocked to a U.S. government-sponsored film
exhibit, waiting for hours in line for a ticket to such films as
``Cinderella,'' ``Sophie's Choice'' and ``Silverado.''
   The exhibit, which opened May 18 and ended Sunday, is the first
American film show in communist Czechoslovakia. It will appear in
Bratislava in September as part of a U.S.-Czechoslovak cultural
agreement.
   Six films were shown at eight screenings a day at three different
sites in PKOJF, Prague's largest amusement park. The most popular
movie, according to organizers, was ``Sophie's Choice.''
   ``I wish we had more shows like this and more often,'' one man
wrote in a visitor's book.
   The exhibit has toured many East European capitals since it was
launched in 1984, and total viewership is estimated at 700,000, show
officials said.
   Also on display were posters, original costumes, photos and other
items.
   A photo of Czech-born filmmaker Milos Forman invited visitors to
the corner of ``Famous Czechs Who Made It In Hollywood,'' featuring
an Oscar awarded to Theodor Pistek for his costumes in ``Amadeus,''
which was shot in Prague in 1983.
   Forman moved to the United States in 1968 when Warsaw Pact tanks
ended the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and won five Oscars with ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
   ``The average age of those who came here most was between 15 and
25,'' said Fred Stokelin, the exhibit's manager.
   ``It is, therefore, no surprise that the advertising trailers of
Eddie Murphy's `Coming to America' and Tom Waits' `Cold Feet'
created temporary bottlenecks down there,'' said Karen Yaenner, the
show's coordinator.
   ``I think I should be inside in less than two hours,'' an
enthusiastic teen-ager said at the end of a long line Sunday. When
asked what gave him the strength to endure the oppressive heat, he
answered: ``Today's the last day, isn't it?''
   Even the state-run media expressed respect for the show.
   The exhibit ``provoked the interest and imagination of visitors
and provided both entertainment and information'' according to the
official CTK news agency.

<HEAD>Church Officials: Bingo Organizers Not Raising Money For Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bingo operation that grossed $562,000
in the name of a tiny church did so without authorization and turned
over none of the proceeds, the pastor says.
   The use of the name of St. Cyprian's Catholic Church is ``without
authorization or even fraudulent,'' said the Rev. John Bench.
   Bingo is illegal in South Carolina unless sponsored by a
tax-exempt organization, with the profits going to charity.
   An operation headed by Richard Webster, president of Charities
Consultants, has used a permit in the name of the church. Charities
Consultants runs bingo games in the names of 51 charities. Webster
would not comment about the permit.
   The bingo operation in St. Cyprian's name has taken in $562,000
since last July from games at Myrtle Beach, state records show. It
has paid out $420,000 in prizes, leaving $142,000 for expenses and
profit.
   Bench, overseer of St. Cyprian since July, said he does not know
Webster and has not been able to find any records of bingo income
over the past five years. He said Monday he has requested a state
Tax Commission investigation.
   Bench's predecessor, the Rev. Thomas A. Evatt, said a Webster
associate agreed to pay the church $200 to $400 a month for use of
the name. He said there was no written contract, and he did not know
how much the games took in.
   ``Apparently the operation was bigger than I thought,'' he said.
Evatt said that when he left St. Cyprian's last year he did not
inform Bench about the bingo games but assumed the game operators
would.
   ``When I took over St. Cyprian's, it was absolutely bankrupt and
that's why I checked the records,'' Bench said. St. Cyprian has 100
members and a monthly offering of about $600, church officials said.
   Earlier this year, South Carolina Bishop Ernest Unterkoefler
banned bingo as inappropriate for raising money for diocesan
churches and schools, but he said games operating on church premises
can continue until July 1990.

   For the young photographer, the decision to go
underground wasn't hard: last week, police with rifles burst through
the door to his house.
   He had been warned beforehand by a neighbor, and now is living on
the run, his appearance changed by a haircut, shave, some weight
loss and rugged worker's clothes replacing his light polyester
shirts.
   ``I am a new man,'' he said, laughing heartily in a small
restaurant at his first sit-down meal in a week. ``A new Communist
man.''
   The photographer, a Communist Party member from Beijing, is one
of hundreds of people wanted by police for participation in a
movement for freedom. Some of the wanted are well-known, their faces
appearing on television.
   On Tuesday night, a nationally televised news program showed
photographs with biographical information of 21 student leaders
being sought by the government. The photographer was not among them.
   His alleged crimes are vague: during the seven weeks of China's
pro-democracy demonstrations leading up to the June 3-4 killings by
the army, he took thousands of photos of marchers, hoping to
chronicle the movement one day.
   He spent much time with the students and even wore a white
headband that read ``Hunger Strike for Freedom.'' When the People's
Liberation Army stormed Beijing, the photographer was there,
snapping pictures as bullets cut down friends and classmates.
   Soldiers detained him briefly on June 4.
   ``My mind was so clear at that moment. I convinced them to let me
go. When I walked away from the barracks, people came up to me.
`We've heard gunshots from there all day,' they said. `We thought
you'd been executed also,''' he recounted.
   Now, he says he moves from dormitory rooms to friends' apartments.
   ``Last night my old girlfriend took me in. Before that, it was my
high school teacher. Tonight I don't know where I'll be. I'd like to
get out of Beijing,'' he said.
   Leaving Beijing is difficult. Troops and police fill the railroad
station, searching baggage and interrogating passengers about their
destinations. State-run news reports say more than 70 pro-democracy
activists have been arrested fleeing the capital.
   ``I went down there to get a ticket, but I saw troops take two
students away,'' he said. ``The soldiers surrounded these guys and
smacked one in the head with a rifle butt. I was too scared to wait
around.''
   A martial law regulation requires citizens to turn in anyone
suspected of participating in the pro-democracy campaign. Telephone
lines have opened throughout the city for use by informants.
   ``The thing that scares me is that people seem to be listening to
the government's order telling us to report on each other,'' he
said. ``We Chinese like to tell on people. Maybe some one is jealous
and wants my cameras. Maybe they want to get ahead and need to
report someone. It doesn't have to be for political reasons.''
   Despite the government's stepped-up efforts to track down
activists in the democratic movement, the photographer was confident
he could make it out of Beijing safely.
   ``A few days ago I was down. Life was dark,'' he said. ``But
today I woke up and everything had lifted from me. I just want to go
far away, find a place in the mountains and hide a while.''
   The meal ended and he got on his bicycle. He turned west at one
corner, looked back over his shoulder and smiled.

   Mario Max Yzaguirre's fine by a federal magistrate in Laredo last
week was part of an agreement in which the Houston man pleaded
guilty to violating the Endangered Species Act, Assistant U.S.

   Yzaguirre could have sentenced to a year in prison and fined
$100,000.
   He was charged with killing the crane, one of about 200 in the
world, near a federal wildlife refuge outside Corpus Christi on Jan.
3.
   He said he thought the bird was a snow goose.
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said it may still seek
$11,000 in civil damages.

<HEAD>Design Said to Depict Soldiers Heading Down Tree-Lined Path into
Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The design for a long-sought, $6 million Korean
War veterans' memorial being unveiled Wednesday depicts soldiers
heading down a tree-lined path into battle, according to sources
familiar with the plan.
   Architects of the project, to be built across the Reflecting Pool
from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, also contemplate a wall
containing inscriptions about the war.
   No one involved in the memorial _ from the designers to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars and other sponsors _ anticipates the
controversy that surrounded the Vietnam memorial at its Veterans Day
dedication in 1982.
   A vocal group backed by then-Interior Secretary James Watt
opposed the Vietnam project as unheroic. The group won a concession
when a statue of three battle-weary soldiers was added in 1984 to
the memorial's V-shaped wall bearing the names of those killed in
Vietnam.
   A one-eighth scale model of the Korean memorial is being unveiled
at a White House ceremony on Wednesday.
   The four designers said they could not describe the project until
then. But several government and non-government sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, described a succession of granite or bronze
soldiers intended to collectively depict a transition from the
anxious but brave entrance into war, to combat, to returning home.
   Four Pennsylvania State University architects were named by a
jury of Korean War veterans two weeks ago as the winners of a
national contest to design the memorial. They described their entry
a combination of sculpture, architecture and landscape design.
   All of the 1,019 competitors for the $20,000 first prize were
guided by a memorial ``concept'' conveyed to them by the Korean War
Veterans Advisory Board, which was responsible for picking the
winner and raising funds. Some of the $6 million has yet to be
raised, and it is uncertain when the memorial will be completed.
   The purposes of the memorial, according to the American Battle
Monuments Commission, include expressing the ``the enduring
gratitude of the American people for all who took part in that war
under our flag.''
   The memorial is also to ``project in most positive fashion the
spirit of service, the willingness to sacrifice, and the dedication
to the cause of freedom that characterized all participants.''
   Some 5.7 million Americans served in Korea during the 1950-53
conflict. More than 54,000 were killed, roughly the same number
killed in Vietnam. The war began after the Soviet-trained North
Korean army crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea, and ended
with a truce on July 27, 1953.
   ``I didn't know a lot about it. We heard about it from relatives,
uncles and such,'' said John Paul Lucas, one of the Penn State
designers. The designers, who interviewed many Korean War veterans
for the project, range in age from their 30s to their early 50s.
   The project is unlikely to cause the stir created by the Vietnam
memorial, said Veronica Burns Lucas, who is one of the four
designers and is Lucas' wife.
   ``To the general population, it's not likely to cause
controversy. We hope that's the case,'' she said. ``But we weren't
looking to make a non-controversial memorial. We were thinking in
terms of meeting the stated purpose and creating a significant
experience for anyone visiting, to evoke an awareness on the part of
any visitor.''
   Korean War veterans have lobbied for a memorial since 1982, and
at one time a group was pushing for a design by Felix de Weldon, who
designed the Iwo Jima monument. Congress passed legislation last
year to erect the privately financed memorial on the Mall.
   Contributors to the memorial include the VFW, and the American
subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Co.
   Even before seeing the design, VFW spokesman Bill Smith said the
detailed screening process left him confident that the final product
would have the ``100 percent support'' of the veterans' group.

<HEAD>Survey: Many Employers Have Workers With AIDS But Most Lack AIDS
Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of employee health plans shows nearly
60 percent of employers who offer health insurance have had AIDS
cases among workers or covered dependents but just 25 percent have
formal AIDS policies.
   An overwhelming majority of employers surveyed, 92 percent, said
they had not modified their medical benefits plans because of AIDS.
But 3 percent said they had altered the plan and 5 percent planned
to do so by the end of this year.
   Of those employers who had or planned to modify benefit plans, 56
percent said the changes included or would include an AIDS education
campaign, 48 percent said they had or would limit coverage and 23
percent added or planned to add pre-employment testing for the virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The survey, conducted by benefits consultant Foster Higgins last
August and released this week, gathered information on medical
benefits policy from more than 1,600 employers with work forces
ranging from 700 people to more than 40,000 employees. Combined, the
employers surveyed had more than 10 million workers.
   Not all employers answered all of the questions in the survey _
some simply chose not to do so while some questions were not
applicable to certain employers _ so the sample group varied from
issue to issue. The employers surveyed represent a broad spectrum of
U.S. industry and business, and were from every region of the
country.
   Of 651 employers who responded when asked about cases of AIDS
among employees or dependents covered by their health plans, 58
percent said ``yes'' and 42 percent said ``no.'' The average number
of AIDS cases reported was four.
   Employers in the Mid-Atlantic region were most likely to report
at least one AIDS case among workers or plan-covered dependents, 73
percent reported at least one case, while employers in the north
central region of the country _ 12 Midwestern states _ were least
likely to report AIDS among workers or their dependents, with 47
percent reporting cases.
   Communications and transportation services were the industries
with the highest rate of employer-reported AIDS cases among workers
and insured dependents, with 82 percent of employers in those fields
reporting at least one AIDS case covered by their benefit plans. The
lowest rate was reported by employers in health care services, 30
percent of whom reported at least one case of AIDS covered by their
medical insurance.
   Not surprisingly, larger employers were more likely to have
workers or dependents with AIDS than smaller employers.
   Twenty-one percent of employers with fewer than 1,000 workers
reported at least one AIDS case among employees or their dependents
while 89 percent of employers with 10,000 to 19,999 employees
reported cases, 96 percent with 20,000 to 39,999 workers reported
cases and 98 percent of employers with 40,000 or more employees
reported cases.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin says
economic chaos is forcing him to resign five months before his term
ends, and President-elect Carlos Menem said today he is willing to
assume office early.
   ``We are willing, totally willing, to assume the direction of the
Argentine republic on that date, and my hope is that the president
of the nation will put on me the presidential sash,'' Menem told
Radio America.
   Alfonsin said Monday evening he would leave office on June 30
because of Argentina's economic crisis and his inability to handle
it, given his party's loss to Menem in the May national elections.
   ``The government's room for action during the months that remain
of its mandate is too narrow to face the problems with a chance for
success,'' Alfonsin told the nation in a televised address.
   But Menem, a populist champion of the working poor, said he was
taken by surprise by the announcement and said it would be
``impossible'' for him to take office five months early. He said
that it require legislation that could not be enacted in time.
   It looked likely at that point that Menem's younger brother,
Eduardo, who is provisional president of the Senate, would act as
interim president until Menem's change of heart today.
   The six-year term of Alfonsin, whose civilian administration
replaced a discredited military dictatorship, officially ends Dec.
10.
   Alfonsin's address followed days of talks between the governing
Radical Civic Union and Menem's Peronist Party.
   On May 14, the Peronist Party won the presidency for just the
second time in 34 years and attained virtual control of both houses
of Congress. The party already controled legislatures in 17 of
Argentina's 22 provinces.
   Because Menem, 58, and Alfonsin, 62, have disagreed on how to
improve the economy, little has been done to curtail inflation,
which hit 78.5 percent in May. Interest rates and unemployment also
continue to rise.
   The economic problems have been fueled by Argentina's $59 billion
foreign debt. Problems in repaying the debt and meeting demands by
foreign creditors also caused rioting in Venezuela in February, and
have been blamed for instability in Brazil, Peru and other Latin
American nations.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias cited another
reason for the resignation of Alfonsin, who had been barred by the
constitution from seeking a second term.
   It quoted unidentified government sources as saying Menem was
trying to pressure Alfonsin into granting amnesty to officers who
led three barracks revolts during his tenure and to others convicted
of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship's ``dirty
war'' against leftists from 1976-83.
   ``The insistence ... prompted the government to decide to
announce its departure,'' DyN quoted the sources as saying.
``(Alfonsin) does not want an amnesty.''
   A former president and army commander, Gen. Jorge Videla, and
seven other top officers were convicted of human rights abuses
committed during the seven-year dictatorship, when at least 8,961
people were arrested, never seen again and presumed executed. Human
rights groups claim the death toll is much higher.
   The armed forces claims it used unconventional tactics to fight
an unconventional enemy and save Argentina's democracy.
   The military returned to the barracks after presiding over an
economic collapse, losing the 1982 Falklands War to Britain and
encountering worldwide condemnation over its human rights policies.

<TEXT>
   A possible plan for establishing an
autonomous ethnic German settlement in the Soviet Union has ignited
hopes for stemming the westward flow of Soviet Germans.
   Soviet officials have given contradictory reports on the
likelihood of a German region emerging. A designated zone that could
trade freely with the West would offer a unique foundation on which
to build Soviet-German business ties.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told journalists
covering Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Bonn that
one proposal calls for establishing an ethnic German region in
Kaliningrad.
   Now a pocket of the Russian republic wedged between Poland and
Soviet Lithuania on the Baltic coast, Kaliningrad was known as
Koenigsberg prior to its transfer to Soviet control after World War
II.
   As the Kremlin has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of
those with German ancestry, tens of thousands of ethnic Germans have
abandoned their Soviet homes to settle in West Germany.
   Many of the emigres stem from German settlers who went to Russia
300 years ago in the time of Peter the Great, and their assimilation
into modern West German society has been difficult and costly for
the Bonn government.
   West Germany's constitution recognizes a right by all people of
German nationality to return to their homeland, and massive outlays
for housing, language instruction and work training have been
necessary to help the Soviet Germans get settled.
   About 50,000 Soviet Germans arrived in West Germany in 1988.
   Asked if the idea of an autonomous region for Soviet Germans came
up during Gorbachev's talks with West German leaders Monday, Bonn
government spokesman Hans Klein said it had not. But he added the
subject ``lies close to the heart'' of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   ``I can assure you this development will be a very important
subject in the discussions to be conducted,'' Klein said.
   Gerasimov said the idea of an autonomous German region within the
Soviet Union ``is one of a number of possibilities'' under
discussion as a means of helping those of German origin to retain
their ethnic traditions.
   A designated autonomous region for Soviet Jews was established in
the Siberian region of Birobidzhan in the 1930s, but today its
Jewish population is a minority.
   Large groups of Soviet Germans are settled in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan, where they were forcibly relocated from the
Volga region and Bessarabia by dictator Josef Stalin before and
during World War II.
   Gerasimov said earlier that one idea under discussion as a means
of improving conditions for Soviet Germans is to allow them to
establish their own region within the country.
   He said one location under consideration is the Kaliningrad area
because it is relatively undeveloped and sparcely populated.
   Kaliningrad remains a closed region within the Soviet Union,
presumably because it has a number of strategic naval bases on the
Baltic coast.
   Gerasimov said officials looking into ways of countering the
trend toward emigration came up with the proposal, and that they
have even put forward a possible name for the region.
   ``They could call it Kantograd,'' he said, in honor of the 18th
century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, the most famous figure to
have emerged from the region.
   However, a Communist Party Central Committee adviser on German
affairs suggested the idea of an autonomous German zone within the
Soviet Union remains ``speculative.''
   ``Everyone has the right to speculate on how to solve problems,
but there is no such formal proposal,'' said Nikolai Portugalov,
also in Bonn for the summit.
   Establishing a special German zone would give West Germans eager
to help develop a stronger trade base in the Soviet Union a logical
place to invest in joint ventures or other cooperative endeavors.
   But a free-trading autonomous region on the Baltic coast might be
troubling to neighboring Poland, as well as NATO members who might
view a Soviet-German region as a precarious attraction for West
Germany.
   It could also be negative for Moscow, since it would almost
certainly boost the resolve of the Baltic republics to gain
independence from the Kremlin.

   Charles Rutherford, a Canadian who was the last
surviving holder of the Victoria Cross in World War I, has died in
Ottawa at age 97.
   The obituary, published in London's Daily Telegraph, said
Rutherford won the medal Aug. 26, 1918, when the Canadian platoon he
was commanding captured a French village giving observers a view of
the defenses of the German Hindenberg Line.
   Only 18 days earlier, Rutherford had won the coveted Military
Cross for bravery by capturing another village on Aug. 8, when the
Allied offensive that would end the war began that day in front of
Amiens.
   Rutherford rejoined the army In World War II and took part in
protecting the Duke of Windsor in the Bahamas and guarding
prisoner-of-war camps in Canada. Before retirement he was postmaster
at Colborne, Ontario.
   The obituary did not say when Rutherford died.
   The Victoria Cross, the highest British honor for battlefield
courage, was awarded to 633 people during World War I.

   Forty-four veterans hospitals had
``significantly elevated'' rates of death among patients, and more
than five percent of those who died were found to have received
inappropriate care, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs
report issued today.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, who ordered the
report released today, cautioned in a letter to Congress that ``no
general statement about the quality of care'' in veterans' hospitals
``can be drawn from these findings.''
   Nonetheless, Derwinski said, ``we must try to do better.''
   The report is based on a review of 1,771 deaths in 1986 among
patients at the 172 VA medical centers around the country. Medical
records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of
evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on
several factors, such as patient age, condition and type of illness.
   From this study, the report concludes that 44 medical centers had
``significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four''
patient categories. Twelve of these 44 centers had overall death
rates that were ``significantly elevated.'' Fifteen of the VA
medical centers were judged to have mortality rates lower than
expected.
   Evaluators ordered 123 of the 1,771 cases to be reviewed by a
group of doctors not associated with the VA hospitals, a system
called peer review.
   Of the 123 cases examined in detail, two groups of peer reviewers
found 90 cases in which the care given was not consistent with
current medical practice.
   ``The agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it
appropriate to describe them as having `likely' quality of care
problems,'' the report said.
   The VA hospitals with higher-than-predicted death rates were
identified as those veterans' medical centers in these cities:
   Albany, N.Y.; Alexandria, La.; Asheville, N.C.; Atlanta.; Battle
Creek, Mich.; Biloxi, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.; Buffalo, N.Y.;
Chillicothe, Ohio; Cincinnati; Columbia, S. C.; Dayton, Ohio;
Denver; Des Moines, Iowa; Durham, N.C.; Fayetteville, N. C.;
Houston; Indianapolis ; Iowa City, Iowa; Leavenworth, Kan.; Lebanon,
Pa.; Lexington, Ky.; Little Rock, Ark.; Loma Linda, Calif.; Marion,
Ind.; Martinsburg, W. Va.; Memphis, Tenn.; Montgomery, Ala.;
Mountain Home, Tenn.; New Orleans; North Chicago, Ill.; Oklahoma
City; Perry Point, Md.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Pittsburgh; Salisbury, N.
C.; St. Louis; Tampa, Fla.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Tuskegee, Ala.; Waco,
Texas; Walla Walla, Wash., Washington, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Of the 44, at least 22 also were judged to have ``likely quality
of care problems.'' They were the ones in Albany, Asheville,
Atlanta, Battle Creek, Chillicothe, Columbia, Dayton, Denver,
Durham, Houston, Iowa City, Leavenworth, Loma Linda, Marion, New
Orleans, Phoenix, Salisbury, St. Louis, Tuskegee, Waco, Walla Walla
and Washington.
   Officials said data to rank San Juan for quality of care had not
been evaluated.

<HEAD>Socialists Surge Ahead in Election Campaign on Thatcher Factor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 10 years of Conservative government by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, it has been a while since her opponents
have relished an election.
   But this is it.
   In the campaign for the European Economic Community's
parliamentary elections Thursday, the Labor Party has surged ahead,
the Tories are on the defensive and there's only one issue: Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Labor has turned the election into a referendum on the Thatcher
decade _ with emphasis on the charge that she is a reluctant
European, fighting each step toward a Europe that conforms in
everything from a single currency to the size of health warnings on
cigarette packs.
   The Conservatives also face strong challenges in by-elections
Thursday to fill two vacant British parliamentary seats in Glasgow
and London.
   In the European elections, British voters will choose 78
representatives to the 518-member Parliament. The body's limited
powers include approving trade agreements involving EEC members.
   The elections come as Mrs. Thatcher is taking on the community's
administrative headquarters in Brussels, which she says wants to
impose ``socialism by the back door'' on the 12-nation EEC.
   She is particularly angered by a proposed EEC ``social charter''
that would provide for Europe-wide minimum wages and worker
representation in industry.
   ``We have not rolled back the frontiers of socialism in this
country to see them reimposed from Brussels,'' she said at an
election rally on Friday.
   ``Labor wring their hands and protest that we're far too
combative,'' she said. ``What do they want, a doormat?''
   The audience cheered.
   But the government is in increasing trouble over strikes and
rising inflation. Labor recently revamped its platform, moving to
the center and dropping its policy of unilateral nuclear
disarmament, a big vote-loser. Now the party is on the attack.
   So is Mrs. Thatcher's Tory predecessor, Edward Heath, an ardent
European who accuses her of misleading the public with ``absolute
nonsense'' about moves toward socialism by the European Commission
that governs the EEC.
   Some less prominent Conservatives also are uneasy about the
Thatcher style in Europe.
   ``Should we really have to block every European Commission
proposal on principle?'' said Michael Welsh, a Tory member of the
European Parliament. ``It simply isn't true that a lot of leftist
loonies are running the show.''
   The Economist, a respected weekly, said Mrs. Thatcher's prickly
attitude toward continental Europe could backfire on Britain's
strong friendship with the United States.
   ``For the Americans it is no use having a special relationship
with a sulky outsider,'' The Economist said.
   Many Europeans believe Mrs. Thatcher is a British nationalist who
is only interested in the EEC's economic benefits.
   She responds that she dares to say aloud what others secretly
believe: that the United States of Europe is a pipe dream.
   In Britain, bashing what Mrs. Thatcher still calls ``the
Europeans'' has never been a vote-loser. The Tories' balance-sheet
approach to Europe is reflected in their main newspaper campaign ad,
which crows that since 1984 the Tory government has won about $7.6
billion in refunds from EEC coffers.
   The bulk of the refunds came after Britain won arguments over the
size of its contributions to the EEC.
   Defending Mrs. Thatcher, Kenneth Minogue, professor of politics
at the London School of Economics, said: ``She just doesn't want a
highly regulated, mercantilist, absolutist fortress Europe. That's
what she's attacking.''
   In the last European election in 1984, the Conservatives won 45
of mainland Britain's 78 seats in the Strasbourg Parliament, Labor
32 and the Scottish Nationalist Party one.
   This time, analysts expect the Conservatives to lose four to five
seats to the socialists.
   The latest Gallup poll, a huge survey of 9,000 voters, gave Labor
43.5 percent of the vote, a 7-point lead over the Conservatives and
the opposition party's highest rating for eight years.
   All parties share the biggest battle of all in a European vote in
this island nation: apathy, which in the 1984 Euro-election produced
the lowest turnout in the EEC, 32 percent.
   But Gallup showed Labor with a 15-point lead among those who said
they were certain to vote.

   County governments employ more than a

counties, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   Overall, the nation's counties had a total of 1,962,711 employees
as of October 1987, the most recent detailed figures available, the
bureau said.
   That was a 1.9 percent increase from the year before.
   But the tally of 264,541 teachers was a 5.3 percent hike, the
bureau noted, making teaching one of the fastest-growing job
categories.
   Leading in growth rate was the 12.4 percent jump in county
corrections workers to 114,407.
   There was a 5.5 percent increase in firefighters, to 21,175, and
a 6.5 percent increase in water workers, to 9,076.

   Authorities used water cannons to extinguish a fire
that blazed for three weeks on an offshore oil and gas platform in
the Caspian Sea, Tass reported Tuesday.
   The fire began May 26 and affected six wells on a platform 86
miles off Baku, the capital of the republic of Azerbaijan, the
official news agency said.
   The entire firefighting fleet of Azerbaijan converged on the
platform with portable and stationary water cannons to unleash the
jet of water that experts said was needed to put out the fire,
according to Tass. Earlier efforts using water and foam had failed,
it added.
   The Soviet Union's top experts were called into to help douse the
fire, and U.S. firefighters also provided assistance, the news
agency said.
   The cause of the fire has not been determined, Tass said.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer and
Azerbaijan, 1,200 miles southeast of Moscow, is the country's
fourth-largest oil producing region.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sluggish automobile and department store
purchases slowed the pace of retail sales in May to a weak 0.1
percent increase, the government reported Tuesday, and analysts said
they do not expect much improvement soon.
   ``I think this is what the pattern will be like as we look
forward,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, an economist with the WEFA Group
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``I don't think you'll see a big retrenchment,
but there won't be much growth in consumer spending ... for several
years.''
   Allen Sinai, an econmist with the Boston Co., agreed, saying, ``I
think it (the retail sales report) reinforces what is now and
probably will continue to be a much more cautious consumer
throughout the balance of the business expansion.''
   The Commerce Department said retail sales increased to $141.1
billion on a seasonally adjusted basis last month after rising a
strong 1 percent in April and 0.1 percent in March.
   But the April increase included a 2 percent boost in auto sales
due to rebates and low interest rates designed to lure buyers into
dealer showrooms. Despite the extension of the incentives into May,
car sales increased only 0.2 percent last month. Auto sales rose
only 0.5 percent in March.
   Autos represent about 20 percent of all retail sales.
   Also hit by the slowing economy were department store and general
merchandise sales, which fell 1.2 percent in May following an 0.8
percent rise in April.
   Specialty clothing sales were off 1.4 percent after a 3.9 percent
jump the preceeding month.
   The economy has been slowing and, until recently, interest rates
rising as the Federal Reserve applied the brakes in an attempt to
stem inflation. But as inflation seemed to slow and amid worries the
economy could slide into a recession, the Fed slightly eased
pressures on interest rates this month.
   Nevertheless, analysts say interest rates and inflation continue
to be a factor in consumer spending. Also, in recent years,
consumers have taken on a large amount of debt to buy cars and other
big-ticket durable items expected to last more than three years.
   ``Some of the huge pent-up demand for cars and other durables
which existed five or six years ago has been used up to some
extent,'' Chimerine said. ``People borrowed heavily and spent for a
number of years and now we're on the down side of that cycle and it
could take a long time before we see a major revival in spending.''
   The Commerce Department said sales of durable goods rose 0.3
percent in May, down from a 1.8 percent hike in April that included
the incentive-driven boost in auto sales. Non-durable goods sales
were level in May after a 0.6 percent increase the previous month.
   Sales in the food and grocery store category were up 0.5 percent
in May; gasoline service stations, up 0.9 percent, and drug stores,
up 1.8 percent.
   Bar and restaurant sales were down 0.4 percent, while building
material and furniture sales were flat.
   The department said overall retail sales were up 5 percent for
the three months from March through May, compared with the same
period of 1988.

   Army medical officers were deployed to
state hospitals and clinics to treat emergency cases Tuesday, the
second day of a nationwide strike by junior government doctors.
   Public Service Minister of State Chris Andersen warned the
strikers they will be prosecuted if they don't return to work
Wednesday.
   Under the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act, people employed in
essential services are banned from strikes and can be imprisoned for
up to two years.
   Hundreds of interns in state hospitals and clinics struck Monday
for the second time in seven months, demanding a review of wages and
working conditions.
   Health Minister Felix Muchemwa has said he has drafted proposals
for a new deal for the doctors, details of which would be unveiled
soon.
   Only emergency cases were being treated by senior doctors and
army medical teams in state hospitals, officials said. Patients not
in need of immediate care were being turned away.
   Junior doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had
seen part of the government offer and it was unacceptable.

<HEAD>Reagan Says West Should Take Risks for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan said Tuesday that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is possibly his country's only hope for change,
and ``we should take the risk'' of believing he is serious about
arms control.
   Of China, the former president said: ``The Chinese government
hasn't learned something very elementary: you can't massacre an
idea. You cannot run tanks over hope. You cannot riddle a people's
yearning with bullets.''
   Reagan was addressing The English Speaking Union in the
Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of London city government, where
he spoke as president 13 months ago and where Gorbachev gave a
speech in April.
   Reagan, on his first visit to Britain since leaving the White
House, mixed jokes and reminiscences with a sweeping vision of a
world where ``The Goliath of totalitarian control will rapidly be
brought down by the David of the microchip.''
   ``I believe Mikhail Gorbachev realizes these things,'' said
Reagan.
   ``I believe Mikhail Gorbachev is the Soviets' best and probably
only hope to turn things around,''
   ``It is true that the West could stand pat while this is
happening. We are not the ones who must change. It is not our people
who're isolated from the information that allows them to be creative
and productive,'' he said.
   ``But it is exactly when you are strong and comfortable that you
should take risks.''
   He said: `` I believe we should take the risk that the Soviets
are serious in their efforts to reach genuine arms reductions with
the West. I support President Bush's proposal to keep pressure on
the Soviets to make good on their calls to reduce arms.''
   ``The biggest of Big Brothers is increasingly helpless against
communications technology,'' he said.
   ``Information is the oxygen of the modern age. ... It seeps
through the walls topped with barbed wire. It wafts across the
electrified booby-trapped borders. Breezes of electronic beams blow
through the Iron Curtain as if it was lace.''
   He said that as long as the Soviets restricted the flow by such
measures as banning the unauthorized use of photocopiers, the West
should go on refusing to sell the Soviets modern computers.
   ``When the Soviets are willing to allow their own people to have
computers and telephones and copiers and the other devices of
information, then we should rethink our objections to what we'll
sell them,'' Reagan said.
   ``Amazing things are afoot in the world this spring,'' he said.
   Poland had held its first semi-free election in 40 years; Hungary
was moving to multiparty democracy; Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov
sat in Parliament, and in China, ``those heroic Chinese students who
gave their lives have released the spirit of democracy and it cannot
be called back,'' Reagan said.
   Answering a reporter's question about China as he left the
Guildhall, Reagan said: ``I think the students were right and we
should do everything we can to help.''
   In his speech, Reagan joked about the pleasures of addressing an
English-speaking audience, recalling an embarrassing episode in
Mexico when he enthusiastically applauded a speech in Spanish, which
he didn't understand, only to discover that he was listening to the
translation of the speech he had just given.
   Another joke was about East German leader Erich Hoenecker meeting
a beautiful woman and offering to grant her every wish. She asks him
to tear down the Berlin Wall, to which he replies: ``I know; you
want to be alone with me.''
   Burke's Peerage, which chronicles the British aristocracy, said
Reagan has accepted the offer of an honorary knighthood, the highest
royal honor Britain bestows on Americans. But Buckingham Palace and
Reagan's press spokesman, Mark Weinberg, refused to confirm or deny
the report.
   After dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday

   A Star Wars experiment to test how a neutral
particle beam accelerator would work in space was aborted Tuesday
when a rocket failed to ignite on command.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said the so-called
BEAR experiment at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico had been
postponed until next month while technicians tried to determine what
went wrong.
   ``There was a problem with the Aires booster,'' Williams said.
``The missile did not fire and that's all I can tell you about that.
   ``And so the launch was aborted. The Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization hopes to reschedule the launch for mid-July.''
   The BEAR _ or Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ has been planned
for more than a year and is considered a key step in the Pentagon's
research to explore futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful
beams of atomic particles across space.
   The experiment involved the lifting into space _ just for a few
minutes _ of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires
rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator would
be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and
how the particle beams moved.
   The total flight was to last only about 15 minutes.
   The Star Wars office at the Pentagon said Tuesday it was too
early to gauge exactly what went wrong at White Sands, but that the
problem clearly involved ``a malfunction in the rocket and not the
payload.''
   The Star Wars program is a research effort to develop lasers,
beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be used to
automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the United States
or its allies. The Pentagon and Energy Department are spending $4
billion on such research this year.

   American band leader and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie
got a warm welcome Tuesday as Culture Minister Jack Lang named him
Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's most prestigious
awards for excellence in the arts.
   An all-star lineup of American jazz greats was on hand for the
ceremonies in the gilded salons of the Culture Ministry, which was
packed with fans.
   Saxophone player Stan Getz, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bass
player Percy Heath, pianist Hank Jones, singer Billy Eckstine,
drummer Max Roach and saxophone players Jackie McLean and Phil Woods
were made Officers of Arts and Letters.
   ``This is a great pleasure, and entirely unexpected,'' Gillespie
said during the ceremony. ``It's a great thrill to have these great
gentlemen standing behind me. I'm their greatest fan and I thank you
very much.''
   The musicians are performing this week at the Villette on the
northern edge of Paris.

   The child stars of the wholesome ``Father
Knows Best'' series of the 1950s and '60s faced an off-camera
reality of drugs and brushes with the law, TV Guide magazine reports.
   The safe, loving, household of the Andersons, played by Robert
Young and Jane Wyatt, was far from the broken homes their three TV
children knew, writes Mike Littwin, a sports columnist for The
Baltimore Sun.
   Billy Gray, who played Bud, had no curfew and little direction.
His acting career effectively ended after he served a jail term for
marijuana possession.
   ``I didn't think much about the difference between my life and
Bud's then,'' he said. ``But now I look back at the show and see it
as a lie, a lie that was sold to the American people.''
   At 51, he has been married three times.
   Lauren Chapin, who portrayed Kathy, was married at 16, divorced
at 18. She went to jail for attempted check forgery. After kicking
her drug habit, she turned to religion and is an evangelist, living
with her second husband and two children in Killeen, Texas.
   Elinor Donahue, who played Betty, had a failed marriage to a man
working on the show. But another marriage has lasted 28 years. At
52, she is the mother of four and still working in television.
   ``I know everybody didn't live the way it was shown on `Father
Knows Best,''' she said. ``But there's nothing wrong with having
goals and visions and dreams. In that respect, `Father' filled a
wonderful part.''
   An article in the magazine's June 17 issue comes as cable's CBN
Family Channel has a seven-hour marathon of ``Father Knows Best''
episodes and reminiscences scheduled to air Sunday.

   He doesn't have Paul Newman's electric blue
eyes _ his are more blue-green. His hair is more blond, and at 42,
he is 22 years younger, but Fred Lewis looks enough like Newman to
be enjoying a lot of attention.
   Lewis, Newman's double during filming of the movie ``Blaze,'' was
mobbed when he stepped out of a limousine during filming in the
north Louisiana town of Winnfield.
   ``They said how great it was to meet me, and that they had seen
me on the screen for years,'' Lewis said. ``I tried to tell them
that they had the wrong fellow, but they just didn't want to hear
that.''
   Lewis will be faintly visible in scenes where Newman flashes by
in a car or appears as a vague outline.
   The movie casts Newman as former Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long
during his whirlwind relationship with stripper Blaze Starr.
   Doubles are hired to spare actors burdensome tasks such as the
one Lewis faced when the film makers shot the scene where Long lay
in his coffin.
   ``I had to lie in state,'' Lewis said. He was able to remain
still until Lolita Davidovich, the actress who portrays Starr, bent
over him, pinched him and made mock kissing sounds.

   Astronaut George ``Pinky'' Nelson is leaving
the space agency to become an associate professor of astronomy and
provost at the University of Washington in Seattle.
   Nelson, who grew up in Minnesota, said he will continue to
support the space program through speaking and writing, but his
focus will be on academic work.
   ``I don't want to be sitting around talking about how good we
were, at least for a while,'' he said.
   A veteran of three space shuttle flights at age 38, Nelson said
he wants to return to his first career of astrophysics before he is
too old to accomplish anything.
   He also said he and his wife, Susie, a psychologist, are looking
forward to leaving Houston for the campus in Seattle, where he
received his doctorate in 1978. The Nelsons have two daughters, ages
17 and 14.
   Nelson served on the Discovery mission that returned the United
States to space two years after the Challenger explosion. In 1984,
he donned a backpack equipped with gas jets and flew untethered to
try to capture a spinning satellite, the first ever repaired in
space.

   Three teen-agers were sentenced to jail
for up to a year and a fourth was sent to a juvenile center for
smashing their way into a high school with a forklift and causing $4
million damage.
   They also were ordered to perform to least 2,500 hours of
community service each.
   ``What you did was very wrong. You broke into your community's

Monday.
   The four had pleaded guilty to burglary and criminal damage at
Henry Sibley High School in Mendota Heights. They were sentenced by
Lacy and District Judge William Thuet.
   An estimated $3.6 million of the damage in March resulted from
the opening of a fire hydrant, which soaked asbestos insulation,
forcing its removal.
   Jason Todd Lasch of St. Paul was sentenced to a year in jail and

   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the American
consulate in Shanghai, the largest city in China, soon will begin
issuing temporary visas to Chinese seeking to leave the troubled
country, the State Department announced today.
   It was not immediately clear whether authorities who have been
cracking down on dissenters and other pro-democracy forces will
permit a significant exodus. But department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said U.S. diplomats in Beijing and in Shanghai ``will do
what is necessary'' to process aplications.
   Troops surround the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the capital, in an
apparent effort to prevent students and others sought by authorities
from taking refuge there with dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian.
   However, Ms. Tutwiler said she was ``not aware of any harassment
of people standing in line.''
   The spokeswoman said the embassy and consulate would begin
issuing limited non-immigrant visas on Wednesday. These usually are
for temporary visits and require either an invitation from the
United States or a specific event the applicant wishes to attend.
   Students sought by the police were thought unlikely to apply
because they would expose themselves to arrest. Also, they would
need the approval of their schools to get a temporary visas.
   Until now, the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, formerly Canton, has
been the only U.S. post to issue immigrant visas to Chinese
applicants.
   Meanwhile, Ms. Tutwiler said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III held an unannounced meeting Monday with Chinese Ambassador Han
Xu at the envoy's request. She declined to provide any details, but
apparently the meeting dealt with the two dissidents sheltered in
the U.S. Embassy and efforts to arrange their departure from China.
   The spokeswoman again criticized the Chinese government for
continuing arrests of critics of the regime. She said the arrests
were ``very disturbing'' and called on authorities to respond with
dialogue instead of repression to the dissidents.
   On the offensive Monday, the State Department sharply criticized
China and paramount leader Deng Xiao-ping even while trying to work
out a diplomatic solution for the two sheltered dissidents.
   The U.S. condemnation challenged Chinese disavowals that hundreds
of students were shot dead by Army troops in Tiananmen Square.
   ``The whole world has seen what happened,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
``Large numbers of peaceful demonstrators were killed by army units.
We condemn the use of live fire against unarmed civilians, which is
what happened in Tiananmen Square.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Chinese had strengthened security around
the U.S. Embassy to prevent other dissidents from joining Fang and
Li, and were jamming Voice of America broadcasts.
   At the same time, she had sharp words for Deng, who emerged
Friday from more than three weeks of seclusion with praise for the
army's suppression of pro-democracy forces.
   His performance cast doubt on Deng's reputation as a cautious but
ardent advocate of reform of the Marxist system. Ms. Tutwiler said
if Deng ``was responsible for the brutal attack on Tiananmen Square,
then he has acted to undercut the very reform process he has sought
to foster. That is a tragedy for China, its people and the legacy he
sought to pass on.''

<HEAD>Down-Home Food Gets High-Society Twist At Southern Food Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some parts of the South, what chef Robert
Dickson does with catfish and collard greens probably is unheard of.
   But creativity was the key as Southern cooking afficionados
gathered here for the first Southern Food Festival. The American
Institute of Wine and Food brought out the good silverware and its
members ate the night away, singing the praises of Southern chefs.
It was a weekend of indulgence that left fans of food and drink
stuffed to the gills.
   It was only natural that the chefs showcase typical Southern
dishes with gourmet twists that made diners mighty proud of that
good eatin' below the Mason-Dixon line.
   There was catfish, which Dickson, chef-owner of Robert's of
Charleston, in Charleston, S.C., smoked and covered with a creamy
sauce. He whipped a batch of collard greens into a delicate souffle.
   Diners were delighted, and Dickson _ armed with a booming,
operatic tenor _ broke into song.
   ``FOOD, glo-ri-ous FOOD!'' he bellowed. ``It's FOOD, GLO-RI-OUS
FOOD!! WON-der-ful FOOD!!''
   From the tentative first nibbles of venison rib, summer squash
cake and fried oyster appetizers, to the garlic cumin bread, turtle
soup, pork cut thick like Porterhouse steaks with homemade fruit
relishes, grilled quail salad, Savannah cream cake with peach and
raspberry puree, right down to the last sip of wine made from the
native muscadine grape, Dixie dining as social legend was celebrated.
   ``We use food as a focal point. Churches have used it, schools
have used it, communities have used it,'' said speaker Jerry
Bentley, an expert on Southern traditions. ``We had this rural
geography, this rural population, this agricultural economy, we had
no population concentrations, and the food we had was the food that
was available.''
   ``Grilled duck ... black-eyed peas and rice, which to you and me
is Hoppin' John; muscadine preserves and muscadine wine. Put that
combination together and it'd blow you aloose when you taste it,''
Bentley said. ``Now that's what you do with poultry ...''
   Bentley didn't hold back as he regaled the audience with various
uses for Southern foodstuffs, including one used by a physician from
Upson County, Ga.:
   ``He required that his patients chew the stems of collard leaves
as an antidote for jaundice,'' Bentley said. ``We grew vegetables
because they had all sorts of advantages like this.''
   The spirit of culinary camaraderie carried over to the kitchen,
where cooking secrets were traded among visiting chefs, among them
Dickson; cooking show host Nathalie Dupree; Edna Lewis, cookbook
author and longtime authority on Southern food; and Elizabeth Terry,
chef-owner of Elizabeth on 37th in Savannah, Ga.
   ``Nobody was holding back,'' chef Gary Jones of Atlanta said
between compliments on his squash cakes. ``Everybody was sharing
secrets. That was the beauty of it.''
   Ms. Lewis, currently consultant and chef of Gage and Tollner
Restaurant in New York City, said Southern food catches on
nationally because few people truly realize what it is.
   ``They call it American food, but it's really Southern food,''
she said. ``A lot of New Yorkers love it.''
   As dishes were being carted back to the kitchen, the 50 or so
diners began heading home under the influence of another quality of
Southern food.
   ``I'm really getting sleepy,'' said Scott Peacock, a chef at the
Georgia governor's mansion. ``I may have to pull over on the way
home and check into a motel or something.''

   The government flashed pictures of 21
pro-democracy activists on national television Tuesday and said the
students were wanted for leading a counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   ``Every province, region, city, police department, railway
bureau, airline and transportation organ is asked to prevent them
from escaping,'' the television and radio report said.
   The government also put border guards on alert to prevent the
escape of China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi, and his wife, Li
Shuxian, who were accused of counterrevolutionary propaganda but not
on the wanted list. They were in hiding at the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
   Among the students on the wanted list was Wu'er Kaixi, who told
Premier Li Peng in a televised meeting in May that he should ``stop
beating around the bush'' because China faced a political crisis.
   The television report also showed footage taken by a hidden
camera of the charismatic student leader and friends eating at a
``high-class hotel'' and U.S. TV footage of him addressing rallies
for democracy and a freer society.
   Li, who played a leading role in crushing the seven weeks of
protests, told a meeting of top officials Tuesday the army had won
only an ``initial victory'' when it cleared student demonstrators
from Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   ``At present our task is to restore order and strike relentless
blows at the counterrevolutionary rebels,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted Li as saying.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say as many as
3,000 people were killed when the government turned army troops on
unarmed residents. The Chinese government has said nearly 300 people
died, mostly soldiers.
   Streets adjoining Tiananmen Square were reopened to car and
bicycle traffic Tuesday, although no stopping was allowed and
pedestrians remained barred.
   Missing from the meeting with Li were Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang and high-level party official Hu Qili, moderates who
reportedly opposed the crackdown and were stripped of their power by
conservatives led by senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Li also said China would not yield to foreign pressure to change
its policy toward the protesters.
   ``We hope that all countries that wish to keep and develop
friendly relations with China will take a long-term view and avoid
doing anything to hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,'' he said.
   Many countries, including the United States, have condemned China
for ordering its army to fire on the students and supporters.
Several countries have recalled their ambassadors in protest, but
none has broken ties.
   In Washington, the Bush administration indicated it won't allow
Fang and his wife to be arrested. International law forbids Chinese
authorities from entering the embassy compound, which is regarded as
American soil, without U.S. permission.
   Fang, an astrophysicist, did not play an active role in the
pro-democracy movement. But he has long been an outspoken human
rights advocate, criticizing Marxism and China's top leaders.
   Even before the army action, many top student leaders went into
hiding. The Beijing Daily newspaper reported Tuesday that some
student leaders had surrendered, but it gave no names.
   The government wanted list indicated none of the top leaders had
done so. In addition to Wu'er, it included Beijing University
history student Wang Dan and Chai Ling, one of only two women on the
list, who sent a tape from hiding that was broadcast last week by
CBS News.
   The list accused the 21 students of ``inciting and organizing
counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing,'' and contained details
about their height, hair and other features.
   Chinese television has more than doubled its usual 30-minute news
program on recent nights to show the arrests of more than 1,000
workers and unemployed youth nationwide for alleged participation in
anti-government demonstrations.
   The government announced the arrest of a second Hong Kong
resident in connection with the protests.
   Guangdong provincial radio in the southeast said Guo Wenshen was
arrested in Shaoguan city after posting ``reactionary slogans'' on
poles. Another Hong Kong student was arrested at the Shanghai
airport on Sunday and accused of leading an illegal student
organization.
   The government regards Chinese residents of Hong Kong as Chinese
citizens, even though Britain will not return the colony to China
until 1997.
   In the first official indication of possible discontent within
the army, Jilin provincial radio reported that soldiers of an
unidentified army unit had pledged in writing to ``learn from troops
supporting the crackdown'' and to ``abide by orders.''
   The radio report, monitored by the BBC, did not say what prompted
the written pledges. There were small skirmishes last week between
troops carrying out the crackdown and soldiers opposed to it, but
there was no large-scale opposition and by week's end the army gave
an appearance of unity.
   The army's presence in Beijing remained strong Tuesday.
   More than 50 tanks and armored personnel vehicles remained parked
at the north and south ends of Tiananmen Square, and soldiers with
rifles stood every 15 feet along the plaza's perimeter.
   Beijing Radio advised residents not to talk with soldiers, who
have been told they can use their weapons in self-defense and shoot
or take any other measures necessary to stop criminal activity.

<TEXT>
   A former federal housing official, identified
as a key figure in investigations of a low-income housing program
criticized for mismanagement and favoritism, refused today to answer
questions from a congressional panel.
   Invoking her rights against self-incrimination, Deborah Gore
Dean, onetime executive assistant to former housing secretary Samuel
Pierce, declined to answer questions about her involvement in the
process to select which projects would be funded by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Program.
   ``In view of my present inability to obtain access to the HUD
records which would enable me to give accurately testimony that
would be complete and truthful, I respectfully have decided to
decline to answer any questions posed by the subcommittee at this
time on the basis of the rights guaranteed to me under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.''
   Dean, the sole witness to be subpoenaed by the House Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, is also the only
one who has refused to testify. Dean was accompanied by two
attorneys, including former U.S. Attorney for the District of
Columbia Joseph DiGenova.
   Panel chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Dean he and the
subcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed.
But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., questioned whether the extensive
list of documents requested by her attorneys, including all of
Pierce's phone logs and appointments between January 1984 and
December 1988, was reasonable.
   Earlier, another HUD official told congressional investigators
that political influence was involved in the program's selection
process.
   Silvio DeBartolomeis, former general deputy assistant secretary
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and acting
commissioner of housing, said that he ``left town'' to avoid signing
documents approving funding for two projects under HUD's Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   ``I didn't intend to sign them'' without the recommendation of
career employees, DeBartolomeis told the
   But he said he was subsequently ordered to sign the documents by
Dean.
   ``I would have to say that there were political influences
involved,'' DeBartolomeis said in describing the program. It has
come under congressional scrutiny since a HUD inspector general's
investigative audit found several appointees of former President
Reagan profited as consultants to many projects that received
federal funds.
   DeBartolomeis said ``the people that were politically connected''
were the ones who profited from the program.
   ``I never really was part of that selection process,'' he added.
Pierce has testified that he had set up a three-person selection
committee composed of DeBartolomeis, Dean and a department
undersecretary.
   Lantos said in his opening statement that the investigation into
the program ``has opened a can of worms at HUD.''
   He said recent revelations that private escrow agents may have
diverted millions of dollars from sales of HUD foreclosure
properties indicated ``Pierce decided that those HUD programs which
could not be killed by budget slashing could be killed by neglect.''
   DeBartolomeis said that one of his concerns about the moderate
rehabilitation program was that career HUD staffers, whom he had
come to respect and depend on, were not involved in the
decision-making.
   ``I felt that it could be viewed that these were being done in a
political manner,'' said DeBartolomeis.
   He said he expressed his concerns to Dean, whom he viewed ``as
the final decision-maker.''

<HEAD>House Democrats to Elect New Nos. 2 and 3: Gephardt Heads List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Democrats campaigned down to the wire
Tuesday as they sought to complete their top leadership team and
begin to restore order to a chamber distracted for months by ethics
charges.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who ran unsuccessfully for president last
year, was favored in the race for majority leader, while three
Democrats were battling for the post of majority whip in a contest
clouded by reports of an investigation of one candidate's office
staff.
   The Democratic caucus, the 259-member organization of all House
Democrats, will vote by secret ballot Wednesday to fill the
second-and third-ranking positions.
   The new majority leader will succeed Rep. Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., who was sworn in as speaker of the House last week. Foley
replaced Jim Wright, D-Texas, who was driven out by allegations of
financial impropriety.
   The new whip will take the place of Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif.,
who is leaving Congress Thursday over questions about his personal
finances.
   Gephardt, of Missouri, is expected to win the No. 2 spot, though
he does have opposition from Ed Jenkins of Georgia, who ran in an
effort to give Southerners and conservatives a greater voice in a
generally liberal top echelon.
   In the whip's race, the lineup is tighter. Rep. Bill Gray of
Pennsylvania is considered to have a slight but shrinking edge over
David Bonior of Michigan. Gray is chairman of the Democratic Caucus,
while Bonior has been Coelho's chief deputy. Also running, but far
behind, is Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the party's House
political campaign arm.
   The whip contest has been touched by news reports of an FBI
investigation into whether there was a no-work ``ghost employee'' on
Gray's congressional staff. The Justice Department said this week
that Gray himself is not a target of the probe. Gray's attorney,
Abbe Lowell, said the congressman met last week with FBI agents and
will continue to cooperate.
   Foley said he did not believe the reports would affect the race.
``I think the statement (by the Justice Department) was a clear one
and the race is going to be judged on its own merits,'' he told
reporters.
   The leadership shakeup, no matter how it comes out, represents
what Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., called ``the moving of a new
generation of political power into this place.''
   The new team will be more telegenic, more pragmatic, more
interested in bipartisan consensus.
   ``I think it means more focus on the nitty-gritty, day-to-day
management issues,'' particularly on matters affecting the nation's
economy, Obey said. ``The team that's shaping up is going to be a
doggone effective team, and people are going to feel good about it.
Sometimes in the darkest storms you do have silver linings.''
   But some Democrats fear the new team also may lack in the
political gut-fighting instincts that characterized Wright, and
especially Coelho.
   ``I felt I was on the starting team, and was one of the stars,''
Coelho said. ``But you remove one of the starters, and the team
adjusts. Somebody's going to do the political work, because it needs
to be done, and there's recognition for it, and the caucus is going
to demand it.''
   Gephardt would bring his campaign-honed media savvy to the
visible No. 2 job, as well as some luster from his having sought the
presidency.
   He has told supporters he is putting aside presidential ambitions
and is instead putting himself into the long-term line to be speaker.
   Jenkins, a popular insider who is a member of the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, was still in the race on Tuesday, but was
said to be reassessing his bid. Members were sympathetic to his call
for greater representation for the party's conservative Southern
wing, and there was talk of creation of a special post for someone
from that group.
   ``After we've seen the caucus elections, ... we'll have a chance
to examine whether any appointments might be made that would provide
some additional balance in the leadership,'' said Foley.

   Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Tuesday challenged West German industrialists to bet on
his reforms with new investments that could reinforce an era of
better political relations.
   ``If the Federal Republic wishes to secure access to Soviet
markets, it should begin by offering strategic projects rather than
trifles,'' Gorbachev told several hundred business leaders.
   He criticized the West's restrictions on transfer of high
technology to the Soviet Union and what he said is the unwillingness
of many West German businesses to import Soviet products.
   Despite the criticism, Gorbachev was greeted warmly by members of
the German East-West Trade Committee, and received a standing
ovation as he left.
   West Germany already is the Soviet Union's largest Western
trading partner, with an annual trade turnover of $7.5 billion to
$10 billion.
   German manufacturers provide machinery for Soviet heavy industry
as well as manufacture of consumer goods and food processing, all of
which Gorbachev desperately needs to modify the Soviet economy.
   The meeting with the business leaders was a key event for
Gorbachev in his four-day visit as he tries to work out ways to meet
Soviets' increasingly vocal demands that his reform program improve
their daily lives.
   But he has little room to maneuver. Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
said last week the Soviet Union cannot afford to boost imports of
consumer goods because of its budget deficit and poor balance of
payments.
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev said the level of Soviet-West German
trade was ``laughably low'' and that the assets of Soviet-West
German joint ventures could be increased drastically.
   Gorbachev pledged the Soviet Union wouldn't back away from
economic reform, including taming its big bureaucracy. But he said
his reforms need time.
   Moving too fast to create what he calls a ``socialist market
economy'' and make the ruble convertible would lead to economic
chaos, Gorbachev said.
   ``We don't need that, and you don't either,'' he told the finance
and industrial leaders.
   The inability to take rubles earned in the Soviet Union out of
the country as profits is one of the main problems that discourages
Western businesses.
   He defended the quality of Soviet research, and proposed that
Soviet scientists carry out projects for West Germany in return for
technology.
   He proposed that German businesses help the Soviet Union convert
defense industries to peaceful uses, cooperate in building ships and
planes, and noted that talks are under way on developing economic
zones in the Soviet Union.
   Otto Wolff von Amerongen, chairman of the trade group, told
Gorbachev that joint ventures with the Soviet Union have limited
appeal for West German business.
   ``We should not overestimate them as a business instrument,''
Amerongen said. ``In your country they are occasionally thought to
be a wonder weapon of foreign business reform.''
   He added that the Soviet Union could not permanently end its
economic slump without improving the quantity and quality of the
finished goods it exports. Soviet exports now are dominated by raw
materials such as oil, natural gas and timber.
   Gorbachev said he was ``deeply satisfied'' with his two days of
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other top political leaders.
   Both sides have said the talks are putting an end to a tradition
of hostility and suspicion, and opening up broad possbilities for
future cooperation. That is essential to Gorbachev's vision for a
``common European home'' from the Atlantic Ocean to the Soviet
Union's Ural Mountains.
   He stressed to the business leaders that they have a key role to
play in further lessening those tensions.
   ``I can't imagine a common European home without firm economic
ground beneath it,'' Gorbachev said. In order to establish that
security, Europe needs a long period of peaceful development, he
said.

   A rescue helicopter searching a remote valley
early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that
vanished Sunday with 11 people aboard, authorities said. There were
no signs of survivors.
   Pieces of the twin-engine Beechcraft were strewn over the face of
a cliff on Hawaii Island's northeast coast, three miles from where
aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on Monday,
authorities said.
   Marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the
crash site, said Coast Guard spokesman David Santos.
   ``Debris is spread out over a 200- to 300-meter area,'' said
Marine spokesman Maj. Kerry Gershaneck. ``There's nothing that our
people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft. There is
no sign of survivors.''
   The Scenic Air Tours plane disappeared without indication of
trouble Sunday during what was supposed to be an hour-long flight
from Hawaii Island to Maui Island. The plane had left under partly
sunny skies, carrying a pilot and 10 tourists.
   Heavy rain and strong winds on Monday prevented helicopters from
searching the valley. A Coast Guard helicopter had picked up the
emergency signal from the Waimanu Valley region on the northeast
side of Hawaii Island.
   The valley is about four miles long with several major side
valleys and has a 320-foot-high waterfall. It cuts deep into the
5,480-foot Kohala Mountain and is thick with vegetation.
   The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of Hilo and
flying at 2,000 feet, according to Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman George Harvey. The plane passed out of radar contact at
that point and would not have re-emerged on radar until it passed
the island's northern tip.
   The names of those aboard, eight Americans and two Australians,
will not be released until all their families have been notified,
said David Tom, the tour company's operations manager.
   The plane's 28-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours flying
experience and had flown the around-the-island tour about 50 times,
according to Scenic Air Tours chief pilot, Doug Rogers.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.

   Despite its unilateral cuts, the Soviet military's
``overwhelming numbers'' still make it the world's biggest war
machine and don't back up Kremlin claims about a switch to defensive
strategy, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Tuesday.
   ``Speaking candidly, it is rather difficult for Americans _ and
those in many other countries _ to see how such a massive array of
power is mandated by the legitimate needs of defense,'' Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr. told students and instructors at the Voroshilov General
Staff Military Academy in Moscow.
   Crowe, on an 11-day official visit to the Soviet Union, also
suggested that instead of announcing more unilateral reductions, the
Kremlin join the United States in negotiating mutual cuts, even of
modest scale _ a step he said would best promote progress in arms
control.
   ``You'd be surprised at the effect it would have, and pave the
way for more dramatic steps in the future,'' Crowe told his Soviet
audience.
   The 64-year-old admiral, accompanied by an entourage of top U.S.
brass and Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev _ his official host and head of
the Soviet general staff _ also visited once secret military
installations outside Moscow to examine weaponry.
   It was the latest in a series of high-level military visits
designed to dispel mistrust between the superpowers. The visits
began in July with one to the United States by Marshal Sergei F.
Akhromeyev, then Soviet chief of staff. In August, then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci visited the Soviet Union.
   In a heavy rain, Crowe and top U.S. military officers who
accompanied him were shown a training version of a snub-nosed SS-19
missile in its silo at the Balabanovo base, where officer cadets are
taught how to launch the ICBM the Pentagon says can carry six
nuclear warheads up to 6,200 miles.
   At the Kubinka air garrison, Soviet warplanes painted in
camouflage, including the MiG-29 fighter and Su-24 attack aircraft,
were parked on the tarmac for the admiral and his entourage to
inspect.
   Like Carlucci, Crowe also clambered up a metal ladder to board
the Soviet Union's newest long-range strategic bomber, the
needle-nosed Tu-160, better known in the West by its NATO
designation of ``Blackjack.''
   After viewing the aircraft, Crowe said he was very impressed.
``We're talking world-class aviation here,'' he said.
   Gen. Monroe Hatch, deputy chief of the U.S. Air Force, said all
10 Soviet warplanes and helicopters on display already had been seen
by Westerners, some at international air shows or during Carlucci's
visit last year. ``But to say many people have seen the Blackjack is
an overstatement,'' Hatch said.
   In a Dec. 7 speech to the United Nations, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev announced the Soviets unilaterally would cut their armed
forces by 500,000 men, to 3.7 million. Last month, during a session
of the Congress of People's Deputies, he also pledged defense
spending would be cut by the equivalent of $15.3 billion by the end
of 1991.
   Soviet officials say the reductions are in line with the new
military doctrine, announced by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in May
1987, of ``reasonable sufficiency,'' which stipulates that a country
needs enough military might to repel an assailant, and no more.
   Crowe, in his speech at the academy on relations between the U.S.
and Soviet militaries, welcomed Gorbachev's U.N. declaration as an
``important step,'' but played down its overall significance.
   ``As we see it, these drawdowns will affect only the margins of
Soviet military power,'' Crowe said. ``Even after the anticipated
reductions, you will still possess the world's largest active
military establishment, as well as a larger inventory of military
hardware than all of NATO combined in many categories of equipment.''
   In a question-and-answer period, a Soviet Army lieutenant general
who identified himself only as Krebyshev asked Crowe if the
Americans intended to reduce their military forces ``to a defensive
level as we are trying now to do.''
   Crowe reacted with skepticism to the officer's assessment of his
own country's military posture. ``I base my judgment on whether
policy is offensive or defensive on the total strength and weight of
forces that can be brought to bear,'' he said. ``When I'm facing
overwhelming numbers, I can't conclude anything else but that it's
offensively oriented.''
   Moiseyev, seated in front of the lecture hall, objected to
Crowe's assessment. He listed weaponry the Soviet Union has
announced it will withdraw from service, including 10,000 tanks,
8,500 artillery pieces and 850 warplanes.
   ``This is not a propaganda campaign,'' Moiseyev said.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Extend Tax Credits and Simplify Corporate Minimum
Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over opposition of the Bush administration, a
House Ways and Means subcommittee voted Tuesday to extend expiring
tax credits that benefit employers who hire the poor and investors
who put money into low-income housing.
   Also without dissent, the revenue subcommittee agreed to a
significant simplification of the corporate minimum tax and voted to
expand a credit for rehabilitating historic and other older
buildings.
   The four bills now go to the full Ways and Means Committee. Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said major
changes in the bill affecting corporate minimum tax are likely.
   The four House bills would:
   _Extend through 1992 the targeted-jobs tax credit, under which
the government in effect pays up to $2,400 of the first year's wages
of newly hired workers from any of nine targeted poor groups. Those
groups include youths aged 18 through 22, Vietnam-era veterans and
welfare recipients.
   The credit is due to expire at yearend. The administration
contends that in many cases, the credit is only a windfall to an
employer who would have hired the worker without any special
incentive.
   Renewal would cost $647 million over the next five years.
   _Modify and extend through 1992 the low-income housing credit,
which encourages investors to put mney into building and
rehabilitating rental homes for low-income people. This would cost
more than $3.2 billion over the next five years.
   The subcommittee agreed to permit states, which administer the
credit, to carry over for one year any credit authority that was not
used in the previous year. Another change would permit claiming the
credit in 15-year installments; current law has a 10-year limit.
   The administration questions whether the credit makes more
housing available to families who are substantially under the
poverty level.
   _Make the tax credit for rehabilitating old buildings more
attractive to upper-income investors by watering down a restriction
enacted in 1986 in an effort to reduce abusive tax shelters. The
change would cost $145 million over five years.
   The credit is 10 percent of the cost of rehabilitating any
non-residential building constructed before 1936 and 20 percent for
certified historical structures.
   The change would allow an investor at any income level to use a
limited amount of passive losses from rental activities to offset
non-rental income and still claim the rehabilitation credit. Present
law denies that benefit to an investor with total income over
$250,000.
   The subcommittee approved a similar change in the low-income
housing credit.
   _Simplify the corporate minimum tax by eliminating a set of
calculations concerning ``adjusted current earnings.'' The
simplification would cost about $100 million over five years. This
change overrides a provision that was enacted in 1986 but due to go
into effect in 1990.
   Subcommittee members said they will seek to amend the measure to
benefit specific industries, including oil and gas, and state and
local bonds.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl endorsed a joint strategy
Tuesday to ``heal the wounds'' of European division, which their
nations helped inflict half a century ago.
   They assured the world their partnership poses no threat this
time, as it did when Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin divided Poland in
their 1939 non-aggression pact.
   Both nations want ``a common European home in which the United
States and Canada have their place'' and all nations exist in
``peaceful competition with one another,'' the joint declaration
says.
   A tidal wave of goodwill toward Gorbachev on the second day of
his state visit appeared to wash away fears rooted in the collusion
of the dictators and the destruction of World War II.
   At least 3,000 people, many waving Soviet flags and hand-painted
banners with greetings in Russian, welcomed Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, in sunny, cobblestoned Market Square.
   Chants of ``Gorby! Gorby!'' arose when he ventured into the crowd
to shake hands, as he so often does on visits abroad.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the
crowd ``made a strong emotional impression'' on Gorbachev, and ``he
said he felt as if he were on Red Square among his own people.''
   On the steps of City Hall, Mrs. Gorbachev beckoned a
flower-waving child. Her husband held up Heinrich-Sebastian
Schilling, 4, in front of photographers and a cheering crowd.
   At a state banquet at Augustusburg Castle, Gorbachev declared:
``Our cooperation can serve as a catalyst for new relations between
the whole of East and West.''
   Also on Tuesday, he used a speech at the Cologne stock exchange
to outline economic reforms intended to encourage joint ventures
with West German businesses. He appealed for integration of the
economies to make relations ``more quake-resistant.''
   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which began Monday, has been marked
by a clear desire on both sides for a new start in Soviet-German
relations and the cooperative pursuit of European unity by historic
adversaries.
   Hans Klein, a West German government spokesman, described the
joint declaration signed by Gorbachev and Kohl as a turning point in
relations.
   The document states common objectives for improving security and
ensuring peace, which both sides see as a second stage in the
``Ostpolitik'' detente begun in 1970. It reiterates the stated aim
of NATO and the Warsaw Pact to work toward a 50 percent reduction in
strategic nuclear arms and ban on chemical weapons.
   Support is expressed for the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty
between the United States and the Soviet Union, which the Soviets
and West Germans see as prohibiting development of the space-based
defense system advocated by former President Ronald Reagan.
   No reference is made to ways of reducing short-range nuclear
weapons, a major point of contention in arms control talks between
the two military alliances.
   The first joint East-West approach to overcoming divisions in
Europe stresses that other nations should not fear renewed
cooperation between the Soviet Union and West Germany.
   West Germany and the Soviet Union have embarked on a new course,
assuring that better Soviet-West German cooperation `is not directed
against anyone,'' the declaration says.
   Among the common objectives are the ``right of all peoples and
states to freely determine their fate'' and the need ``to heal the
wounds of the past,'' it says.
   Asked whether the agreement could help resolve territorial
questions stemming from the Hitler-Stalin pact, which allowed the
Soviet Union to annex the independent Baltic states of Latvia,
Estonia and Lithuania, Gorbachev said: ``I don't think we need to
turn to such a distant chapter of history.''
   He said the joint agreement's purpose was to formalize the desire
of Moscow and Bonn for ``a new stage in our relations.''
   Gerasimov said at a briefing with Klein that Gorbachev viewed the
joint declaration as the reward of ``a long path of searching over
many years.''
   Ministers of the two governments made 11 agreements official
during the signing ceremony at Kohl's office, but an accord on
access for Soviet shipping to West German canals could not be
completed in time.
   Some of the other agreements establish a Bonn-Moscow ``hot line''
and deal with protection of capital investments, training of Soviet
managers in West Germany and cultural and student exchanges.

   A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk
with great fanfare to commemorate the ``Voyage of the Damned'' was
mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping
lane, officials said Tuesday.
   ``They're going to have to move it,'' said Coast Guard
spokeswoman Veronica Cady.
   The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial
reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast.
   It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turned
away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were
seeking refuge from the Holocaust.
   The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard
intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by
Cuba and forced to return to Europe. Most of the passengers later
died in Nazi concentration camps.
   For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind was pushed off a barge about
a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a
living reef.
   ``It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and
suddenly _ boom! _ somebody made a mistake,'' said Mayor Abe
Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event.
   Federal and Dade County officials who allowed Resnick to sink the
boat are upset about the result.
   ``They didn't even come close,'' complained Susan Markely, an
administrator with Dade's environmental department.
   Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a
delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges. It's
also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels
heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing
buoy, he said.
   ``It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could
hit it,'' Crespo said.
   The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut
to pieces by June 22. If it's not, the government will remove it and
bill Resnick.
   Resnick blames the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug
that towed the yacht to where it was sunk.
   Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat
that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site.
   Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the
coast.
   Resnick said someone will have to pay.
   ``I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys,''
said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director.
   The Ostwind was built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely
used it. After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the
hands of a Jacksonville marina owner.

   A gunman, branded by the mayor as the
``arch-typical vigilante,'' is being sought by authorities for
allegedly shooting at six young people in a subway station in
revenge for them robbing him a day earlier.
   The gunman confronted the six youths Saturday and asked
``Remember me?'' before opening fire with a 9mm gun, police said.
The gunman, described as about 17, then fled the station and
disappeared, police said.
   Robbery charges against three of the youths caught in the gunfire
were temporarily dropped Monday by the Brooklyn district attorney's
office while detectives searched for the victim-turned-gunman.
   ``We need the victim to corroborate the robbery,'' said spokesman
Louis Haber.
   Roy Innis, national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality,
likened the gunman to Bernhard Goetz, the ``subway gunman'' who
wounded four teen-agers on a subway train in 1985 because he said
they had threatened him. Innnis appealed to the gunman to surrender
and offered him free legal counsel.
   ``Your assailants should not be allowed to walk arrogantly free
while you are forced to hide,'' Innis said in a statement.
   But Mayor Edward I. Koch dismissed any comparison between the
gunman and Goetz.
   ``A jury found that Bernie Goetz was in danger, in his mind,
reasonable, under the circumstances, for him to take an action to
defend himself,'' he said.
   ``In this case, this guy was not in any danger. He had been held
up on a prior occasion, recognized the people, apparently, who
allegedly held him up, and went over to inflict personal
punishment.''
   ``That's arch-typical vigilantism _ unacceptable,'' Koch declared.
   Detectives canvassed the area of Friday's robbery and Saturday'
assaults in an effort to find witnesses.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman's office decided
Monday to defer prosecution against David Godbole, 24, Dantay Smith,
16, and a 14-year-old youth whose name was withheld because of his
age, until the victim of the robbery is found.
   Godbole and Smith were wounded in the thigh and the teen-ager was
wounded in the buttocks.
   They were arrested based on statements from the other three
youths who were present both nights, said Transit Police spokesman
Al O'Leary.
   They were charged with first-degree robbery and possession of a
weapon, a hammer, which was allegedly used Friday by the group that
surrounded the man believed to be the gunman and stole his gold
chain and gold bracelet.
   The gunman faces charges of attempted murder and criminal use of
a deadly weapon, police said.

   The nation's beleaguered savings institutions
lost $3.4 billion in the first three months of this year, in sharp
contrast with commercial banks which enjoyed record profits of $7.3
billion, the government reported Tuesday.
   As in the past, Texas S&amp;Ls, suffering from a depressed regional
economy, contributed the bulk of the savings industry's losses.
Texas thrifts lost $2.2 billion, although that was a 38 percent
improvement over the same period in 1988.
   Seventy-three percent of S&amp;Ls nationally earned a profit _ $1.3
billion. But that was swamped by $4.7 billion in losses at the 27
percent that lost money.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that losses by the
2,938 S&amp;Ls worsened from the revised $3.2 billion in the final three
months of 1988.
   Meanwhile, profits at the 13,001 commercial banks hit a record
level for the third straight quarter, up from $6.7 billion in the
final three months of last year.
   The bank board revised its previously reported S&amp;L loss total for
all of last year, adding $900 million to bring 1988 red ink to a
post-Depression record of $13 billion.
   ``The thrift industry will be plagued by continuing losses,''
predicted economist Paul Getman of The WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., consulting firm. ``Not only are property values in some areas
still falling, but thrifts have been squeezed (because) their cost
of funds have been rising faster than their mortgage rates.''
   James R. Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said heavy S&amp;L
losses would continue until Congress enacts President Bush's bailout
bill.
   ``No legislation, no new funds, is not the best way to deal with
open but insolvent institutions,'' he said.
   Barth said the more than 200 institutions rescued last year with
government assistance contributed $145 million in profits, but, he
said, about 10 of those institutions were losing money.
   Reporting on commercial banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said profits rose in 42 states and the District of Columbia
and declined in eight states and Puerto Rico. New England, in
particular, looked weaker, with profits slipping in Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Maine.
   Alex Sheshunoff, a financial industry analyst based in Austin,
Texas, said he was concerned that banks have increased their real
estate lending by 12.9 percent over a year ago while boosting
commercial lending by only 1.4 percent.
   ``Real estate lending has been the Achilles' heel of the banking
industry. We're beginning to see that deteriorate in the
Northeast,'' he said.
   Only one state, Texas, reported a loss for its banks. But its $13
million in red ink was minuscule compared with a $1.7 billion net
loss in the comparable 1988 quarter. Other oil-producing states _
Alaska, Oklahoma and Louisiana _ also showed big improvements.
   John Quinn, an FDIC analyst, attributed commercial banking's
strong performance to a decline in bad loans, particularly in states
west of the Mississippi River, an increase in loan income caused by
rising interest rates, and success in controlling overhead expenses.
   Unlike S&amp;Ls, banks offer mostly short-term loans and can more
quickly raise the interest rate they charge while at the same time
holding down rates paid to depositors. Compared with S&amp;Ls, banks are
hurt less, and sometimes helped, by rising interest rates.
   Quinn said bad loans have declined particularly in farming states
and noted that institutions there so far have not suffered because
of last year's drought.
   Despite the profits, banks continued to fail at a high rate. The
FDIC, which insures deposits, said 93 banks have failed or required
government assistance so far this year, compared with 89 during the
same period in 1988. For all of last year, a post-Depression record
of 221 failed.
   However, the number of ``problem banks'' has slipped to 1,289,
the lowest level in three years, down from 1,491 a year ago.
   Despite the failures last year, banks posted a record profit of
$25.1 billion. That followed a post-Depression low in 1987 of $2.8
billion, which was caused by large write-offs of Third World debt.
   Getman said Argentina's problems in making payments on its $60
billion in debt will likely begin hurting bank performance in the
second and third quarters.
   ``Obviously bank profits are very good, but they're not likely to
stay that good this year,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Menem
changed his mind and said Tuesday he will take office June 30, the
date Raul Alfonsin intends to resign because of the worst economic
crisis in Argentine history.
   ``We are willing, totally willing, to assume the direction of the
Argentine republic on that date,'' Menem told reporters in La Rioja
province, of which he is governor.
   On Monday night, Alfonsin said in a nationally broadcast speech
he lacked the political support to manage the crisis and said he
would leave office at the end of the month.
   From La Rioja, 700 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, Menem
expressed surprise at the statement and said he could not assume the
presidency on such short notice.
   Menem's change of heart Tuesday appeared to resolve an impasse
that began when his Peronist Party defeated Alfonsin's Radical Civic
Union in national elections May 14, seven months before the Dec. 10
inauguration date stipulated in the constitution.
   The constitution requires four months between election and
inauguration of a president so a formal electoral college vote can
be taken, but Alfonsin called the elections early because of the
economic crisis. The charter limits a president to one six-year term.
   For half a day after Alfonsin's speech, it appeared Menem's
brother, Eduardo, president of the Senate, would be interim chief
executive.
   At a news conference Tuesday, surrounded by his Cabinet
designees, Carlos Menem said: ``We are prepared to assume this
responsability on the date the president has decided. That is to
say, on June 30 we will begin to govern Argentina.''
   The Peronists and Radical Civic Union tried for weeks to reach an
accord on an early transition, against a backdrop of inflation that
nearly doubled prices every month, a growing budget deficit, a
nearly worthless currency, record interest rates and rising
unemployment.
   At least 14 people were killed and dozens seriously injured in
food riots and looting that began the last week of May.
   Some in Alfonsin's party said the main obstacle was Menem's
insistence that Alfonsin end the divisive trials of about 18
officers accused of violating human rights in the ``dirty war''
against leftists by the military governments of 1976-83.
   Alfonsin refused to intervene in those cases or to grant amnesty
to officers already tried, convicted and sentenced to prison.
   Army officers demanding the trials be stopped led three
rebellions between April 1987 and December 1988.
   In a draft agreement Alfonsin signed and sent to Menem on Monday,
he said Radicals in Congress would support Menem's economic and
social legislation.
   Menem said Tuesday he needs those votes and asked for ``an
explicit commitment before the Argentine people that the package of
laws that will be sent to the national Congress are going to be
respected, approved and sanctioned.''
   He did not mention the military question.

   Hungary's ruling Communist Party and
leaders of the opposition began negotiations Tuesday on multiparty
elections that could lead to the nation's first coalition government
in more than 40 years.
   Parliament Speaker Matyas Szueros, who presided over the
45-minute meeting in parliament's ornate Hunter Hall, said the
unprecedented meeting marked ``the end of an era and the opening of
a new one.''
   Hungarians are ``anxious and hopeful,'' Szueros told the
delegates. ``The people expect to draw encouragement from your
talks.''
   The party, seven groups largely associated with it and nine
opposition groups are negotiating to determine the rules for the
first multiparty parliamentary elections since the communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   The elections are due by the middle of next year, but there have
been increasing calls for them to be held sooner.
   Szueros said the negotiating parties will meet again on June 21
to agree on the main themes they will address.
   Party chief Karoly Grosz told the participants he hoped for ``a
viable governing coalition after the elections, and in view of this
we need to emphasize the things that unite us.''
   ``Let us work together for a new Hungary,'' Grosz said.
   He said all of the participants want to accelerate the transition
to a more democractic government.
   Speaking on behalf of the opposition, Imre Konya said: ``We do
not want to share in power. We want the citizens to decide whom they
want to entrust'' with leading Hungary.
   ``Everyone must renounce the use of force, even if the elections
do not turn out to their liking,'' added Konya, a lawyer.
   Istvan Kukorelli of the Patriotic People's Front spoke on behalf
of the groups largely associated with the Communist Party, and said
they were ``tolerant of different views.''
   The groups, including the party's youth league and official trade
unions, do not consider themselves a unified body, he said, and ``do
not wish to operate under the tutelage of any party.''
   The three factions formally agreed to the election negotiations
on Saturday.
   Opposition groups established in the past year and a half have
been pressing for a say in drafting legislation and a new
constitution for free elections and the transition to a more
democratic government.
   The party approached the opposition groups about the issues in
March. Those groups said they would participate in any negotiations
as a united front.
   On June 4, Poland held multiparty elections _ the most democratic
in the Soviet bloc in four decades _ and opposition candidates
backed by Solidarity won nearly every seat open to them.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade widened sharply in the first three months of the year as an
improvement in the sale of American merchandise was swamped by a
deterioration in the country's investment balance sheet, the
government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account,
which had fallen for two consecutive quarters, jumped 7 percent.
Analysts viewed the setback as disturbing evidence of how severe
America's trading problems are.
   Meanwhile, the government also reported Tuesday that retail
sales, held back by weak auto and department store sales, rose a
slim 0.1 percent in May.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also transactions in services, primarily
investment flows between countries.
   For the first three months of the year, the merchandise portion
of the deficit showed a marked improvement, narrowing by 13.7
percent to $27.63 billion, the smallest deficit for merchandise
trade in four years.
   That improvement was offset, however, by a steep drop in the
services category, which fell to a tiny surplus of $369 million from
a surplus of $8.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Most of the first quarter decline was blamed on the rising value
of the dollar, which lowers the profits of U.S. companies operating
overseas because their foreign earnings buy less when they are
changed back into dollars.
   Beyond the currency movements, analysts said the trade report was
disturbing because it reflected the fact that America, once the
world's largest creditor nation, is now its largest debtor.
   Simply put, that means foreigners now own more in investments in
the United States than Americans hold in overseas investments. The
total excess of foreign holdings is estimated to have risen above
$500 billion last year although the government's official accounting
of the U.S. net debtor status will not be released until June 29.
   Many economists believe America's standard of living will
deteriorate in coming years as the country is forced to transfer
more and more of its wealth into foreign hands to service its
foreign debt.
   ``The current account reflects how much we have to continue to
borrow,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Here
we are doing so much better on our merchandise exports, but we are
still hurting because of our increasing debtor status.''
   Cynthia Latta, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., said she
believed a decline in living standards could already be seen in the
weak growth over the last few years in personal incomes after
adjusting for inflation.
   ``We are already starting to feel the effects of the consumption
binge the country has been on,'' she said. ``At some point we have
to slow our consumption'' by saving more and thus lessening the need
to import foreign capital.
   The current account provides a measure of the amount of money
this country must raise abroad to finance its economy.
   At the start of this decade, the United States was running
surpluses in its current account because earnings from American
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investment
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when
America became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   The changed status has stired a political debate over whether
growing foreign ownership of American companies, real estate and
Treasury bonds means that the United States is transfering control
of its economic destiny to foreigners.
   Tuesday's report said that in addition to the $27.63 billion
deficit in merchandise trade and the slight $369 million surplus in
the services category, the $30.69 billion current account deficit
reflected payments of $3.42 billion in foreign aid and pensions to
Americans living overseas.
   The government is due to release on Thursday its estimate of the
merchandise trade deficit for April. In advance of that report, many
analysts were looking for little change from the March monthly
deficit figure of $8.86 billion.
   In the report on retail sales, the Commerce Department said the
tiny 0.1 percent increase put May sales at a seasonally adjusted
$141.1 billion.
   Analysts said they expected this sluggishness to continue as
consumers' saw their purchasing power constrained by higher energy
and food costs.

<HEAD>Trade Cases Likely If Steel Import Program Ends, Panel Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allowing steel import barriers to lapse this
year would leave U.S. firms little alternative but to file costly
unfair trading cases against some steel-exporting nations,
proponents of the restraints told a House panel Tuesday.
   A hearing by the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee pitted
advocates of the import curbs against the policy's opponents, who
argued that the steel industry has had too much special protection.
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with
Japan, South Korea, the European Community, Brazil and other nations
to limit the flow of foreign steel into the United States.
   The agreements expire Sept. 30, and President Bush has pledged to
continue the curbs in some form.
   But with the domestic steel industry newly profitable, opponents
of the program believe they can make a case for ending the barriers,
or at least narrowing their scope.
   House backers of the curbs said Wednesday they have 240
co-sponsors for a bill implementing the program. They are hoping
that Bush will soon begin negotiating new steel import pacts with
the 29 nations covered by the old agreements.
   But not all the House members at the hearing agreed that the
pacts should be renewed.
   Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois called for a gradual
phase-out of the import program, and Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said
steelworkers' salaries have been above the average manufacturing
wage since World War II.
   ``Why should we treat the steel industry any differently from all
the other industries?'' said Gibbons, the trade subcommittee
chairman.
   But United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams told the panel
that the alternative to negotiated agreements would be unfair
trading cases filed by U.S. firms.
   ``Most of our trading partners have entered into these
negotiations primarily because, absent negotiated settlements, other
trade restraint options could have been applied against them since
they were vulnerable to being declared as unfair traders,'' Williams
said in a prepared statement.
   ``In other words, it is not unlike an out-of-court settlement
where the evidence of violation, at least in the steel import
situation, was so overwhelming that the offending party preferred
settlement to adjudication,'' he said.
   Frank Luerssen, chairman of the American Iron and Steel
Institute, an industry group, agreed that the alternative to
restraint agreements would be ``massive and very costly trade
litigation.''
   But Gibbons said the negotiated settlements have done little to
discourage foreign governments from subsidizing their steel
industries, making it tough for U.S. firms to compete.
   ``I want to use the laws on the books to whack them in the head,
whack them in the knees and wherever else they need it,'' he said.

<HEAD>MiG-29 Pilot Says Bird May Have Caused Crash of Jet Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet pilot said Tuesday he battled to keep his
MiG-29 from crashing into a crowd at the Paris Air Show last week
after a bird or other foreign object got caught in the fighter jet's
engine.
   Anatoly Kvochur, who saved himself by ejecting from the aircraft
about 500 feet before it crashed Thursday, said he took about three
seconds to decide where to aim his falling jet.
   The 37-year-old pilot, who suffered only minor injuries, spoke at
a news conference inside a huge Antonov-225 transport plane.
   About 2 minutes and 50 seconds after takeoff, Kvochur said he
pushed the throttle to increase thrust, and at that moment the right
engine stalled. He said the MiG-29 is equipped with a special system
to deal with such a situation and he believed the engine would
recover.
   ``I was greatly concerned that the aircraft did not turn to the
crowd of people, buildings and aircraft,'' said Kvochur, who has 12
years of flying experience.
   The aircraft began pulling toward the crowd along the airstrip,
he said, and he expected the engine to recover.
   ``I expected to save the aircraft,'' he said.
   He said he then realized the engines would not recover and a
crash was inevitable, and steered the aircraft to an open space on
the airfield.
   ``You see,'' he said speaking in Russian through an interpreter,
``I had time to spare to think of the situation, but very few
seconds to do it.
   ``It was a hard decision to eject ... it is hard to leave an
aircraft that's still flying.''
   Kvochur thanked the French emergency personnel and doctors who
``treated me with special care.''
   He also thanked Claude Martin, director of flight operations for
the 10-day air show, for making him fly higher than the usual 450
feet at which he flies the same routine in the Soviet Union.
   Kvochur said he suffered only minor bruises to his back and
stomach, and a slight cut on his eyebrow when his oxygen mask struck
his face when he hit the ground.
   ``I feel quite good ... and if my bosses will allow me, I'd like
to fly the MiG-29 from Paris to Moscow, and if they really trust me
I'd like to fly another MiG-29 during the show,'' he said with a
grin.
   Martin, who also attended the news conference, said the pilot
``performed exactly the way I'm supposed to see everyone perform.''
   ``He was on the dot, he made no mistakes,'' Martin said.
   Rostislav A. Belyakov, general designer for the Mikoyan Design
Studio that crafted the MiG-29, complimented Kvochur's performance,
calling him ``the most famous pilot of the day.''
   Balyakov defended the reliability of the MiG-29 which he said the
Soviet Union intends to market aggressively to clients in the
future. ``We have the production facilities to sell the aircraft for
export and we expect to do it,'' he said, adding that it would be
marketed at a price comparable to U.S. fighters.
   Although an official report has not yet been issued Kvochur said
he believed a foreign object, possibly a bird or a small stone from
the airstrip, was sucked into the right engine as it prepared for
takeoff.
   The two flight recorders were sent to Moscow right after the
crash and Belyakov said they corroborate Kvochur's analysis of the
incident.
   Belyakov added that videotapes showed a bird near the aircraft.
   ``There is nothing that can be done to stop a bird flying into
the engine ... and if there was one bird there could have been two
or a whole squadron,'' he said.

   Syrian and Christian soldiers exchanged
fire for five hours Tuesday in an artillery war that has killed
hundreds of people in the past three months, most of them civilians.
   An Arab League envoy met with Christian leaders about ways of
stopping the battle. The league proclaimed a cease-fire in April,
but it has been violated regularly.
   Police said nine people were wounded Tuesday by shelling with
howitzers, tank cannons and recoilless rifles along the southeastern
flank of the 310-square-mile enclave east of Beirut where 1 million
Christians live.
   At least 367 people have been slain and 1,441 wounded since the
fighting began March 8 between Christian army units led by Gen.
Michel Aoun and a Moslem alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse
militiamen.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year after Lebanon's
sectarian civil war began. Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation''
against what he describes as Syrian occupation.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command accused Syrian gunners of
provoking Monday's duel by shelling Christian positions around Souk
el-Gharb, a mountain resort southeast of Beirut.
   Souk el-Gharb commands roads that connect the Christian enclave
and mountains controlled by the Syrians and Druse.
   The spokesman for Aoun, who would not let his name be used, said
Syrian gunners also shelled Kfarshima and Hadath, Christian suburbs
of Beirut.
   Christian gunners ``responded in kind to the enemy fire,''
according to the spokesman. He said the shells came from Aitat, a
Syrian-controlled Druse village south of Souk el-Gharb, and from
Choueifat, a Druse suburb of Beirut.
   ``The Syrian shelling targeted several residential areas,'' the
spokesman said. ``The four civilians were wounded in Hadath.''
   He accused the yrians of starting the fight to ``foil efforts by
Arab leaders to work out a solid cease-fire.''
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the Arab League,
met with Christian leaders in the enclave during the artillery
exchange.
   It began as he drove across the line from Moslem west Beirut to
the Christian eastern sector for separate meetings with Aoun,
Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, former President
Charles Helou and George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Christian
Phalange party.
   Ibrahimi met Aoun at the general's combination bunker and office
beneath the heavily damaged presidential palace in Baabda, east of
Beirut.
   After conferring with the Maronite general, Ibrahimi told
reporters a three-member Arab summit committee was ``determined to
achieve its mandate on Lebanon. The contacts I'm holding are within
this framework.''
   The committee _ King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of
Morocco and Chadli Bendjedid, president of Algeria _ was appointed
by the Arab League summit in Casablanca last month to find a
settlement of the Lebanese civil war.
   Last weekend, Ibrahimi was in Damascus for talks with President
Hafez Assad of Syria, who has become Lebanon's main power broker,
and Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa.
   The latest round in the civil war began two days after Aoun's men
blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias, which deprive the
government of an estimated $100 million a year in customs revenues.
   Druse militiamen led by Walid Jumblatt began the shooting. The
Syrians soon joined them and Moslem forces sealed off the Christian
enclave.

   NBC, on the verge of marking one year atop the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, barely hung onto first place last week
with competition from two NBA playoff games on CBS.
   NBC was also affected by President Bush's prime-time news
conference, because it pre-empted part of the network's high-rated
Thursday lineup.
   NBC won the week ending June 11 with an average prime-time rating
of 11.1. CBS had 10.8 and ABC 9.6. It was NBC's 51st win in a row.
The last time NBC was out of first place was last June, when CBS had
two games of the NBA playoffs, also between the Los Angeles Lakers
and Detroit Pistons.
   The series so far has rated slightly higher than last year's.
Tuesday's game ranked 16th in the Nielsens. Thursday's was tied for
ninth.
   NBC won on the strength of its regular series, even though they
were in repeats. But ABC's ``Roseanne'' continued to top the summer
rankings. NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' dropped to 11th place, which NBC
attributed to the schedule shift for Bush's news conference.
   The rest of the top 10, all repeats except for the NBA game,
were: ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``A Place to Call Home,'' CBS; ``Empty
Nest,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Dear John,'' NBC; ``Wonder
Years,'' ABC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS, tied with the playoff
game; and ``Day by Day,'' NBC, in a special Thursday showing.
   The three-network share was only 58, typical of last summer. But
big interest in news events, particularly China, apparently
contributed to a 14 percent rise in viewership for the networks'
evening newscasts, compared to the previous week. The ``CBS Evening
News'' had a 9.8 rating and 21 share, barely edging the 9.7 and 21
for ``ABC World News Tonight.'' ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.0 and
18.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Fox got its highest share ever out of ``America's Most Wanted''
last week, an 18. It also made some inroads on Monday night with the
second of its monthly theatrical movies. This one, ``Big Trouble in
Little China,'' got a 14 share.
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``Live In,''
``North &amp; South, Book II, Part 5,'' ``ABC Thursday Night Baseball,''
``Beauty &amp; the Beast,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Tour of Duty,''
``Flamingo Kid,'' ``Davy Crockett,'' ``Seaworld: Miracle Babies''
and ``Hard Time on Planet Earth.''

<TEXT>
   Police say robbers netted more than
$1,000 by putting an out-of-order sign on a bank's night depository
that directed business people to put their bank bags in a stolen
mailbox nearby.
   At least three business people deposited their receipts in the
stolen U.S. Postal Service drop box Saturday at the front entrance
to the Valley Bank branch in Shorewood Hills, police in this Madison
suburb said Monday.
   Thieves dropped off the 200-pound mailbox at the bank after it
closed Saturday and removed it that night or Sunday morning,
Detective Todd Kuschel said. He said more than one robber and a
truck or van was probably needed to handle the mailbox.
   Police learned of the robbery after an empty bank bag was found
floating Sunday afternoon in Lake Mendota at Madison. The stolen
mailbox was found nearby.

<TEXT>
   Two videos that include graphic re-enactments of
racial incidents will be shown to Boston schoolchildren this fall as
part of a civil rights education program that police hope will
become a national model.
   Two 20-minute videos, one for elementary school students and the
other for teen-agers, were screened Monday night for city officials,
religious leaders, community organizers and some students.
   Many in the audience gasped at the stark depictions of racism and
discrimination, some of which were drawn from real-life cases,
according to police.
   They will be shown to students in Boston public and parochial
schools in all grades, including kindergarten, this fall.
   The videos included re-enactments of an incident involving a
white man beating a Vietnamese youth on the street and two black
teen-agers punching a white youth as he stood at a bus stop.
   The video designed for younger children included a sketch
involving professional actors and a group of kids who ostracized all
8-year-olds by chanting ``Down with Eights.''
   Among those authorities especially hope to inform are inner-city
children and newly arrived immigrants who learn about the American
system through their children.
   ``For the first time, we will have a program that will teach the
adults of the future that they have the right to dignity _ without
being harassed, intimidated or insulted,'' said Boston Police
Commissioner Francis M. Roache. ``There's a law backing you up.''
   Massachusetts is one of 14 states that has a civil rights
statute, according to police. It was enacted in 1979, and is one of
the toughest civil rights laws in the country, carrying with it a
mandatory 10-year sentence for those convicted of criminal violation
of a person's civil rights.
   The 11-year-old Community Disorders Unit, the first police unit
in the country formed to investigate racially motivated crimes,
commissioned the videos. They were produced in conjunction with the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and WCVB-TV in Boston.
   ``No one in 1989 should be made to suffer in silence,'' said
Leonard Zakim, of the Anti-Defamation League. ``We're doing more
than saying its a terrible thing. We're doing something about it.''
   Boston police say that members of the Philadelphia police
department have already visited the city to learn about the videos
and civil rights education here. They said they hoped the message
contained in the videos will spread around the country and inspire
civil rights education in other cities.

   Police in Shanghai detained a crew from
ABC News as it tried to photograph a family watching China's evening
TV news, a correspondent for the U.S. network said Tuesday.
   ``It was like a scene from a bad Gestapo movie,'' said ABC News
correspondent Mark Litke.
   He said two uniformed police and three plainclothesmen burst in
on the crew without warning Monday night.
   ``They swept aside a curtain and were confronted by us with our
camera, two big lights, a mike man with a boom,'' Litke said. ``They
looked very surprised.''
   The three-member crew and its government-assigned interpreter
were held for about 2{ hours, Litke said, adding that the Chinese
family was not arrested and no videotape was confiscated.
   More than 50 foreign journalists are in Shanghai, China's largest
city, covering events in the aftermath of the June 3-4 shootings of
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   The largest demonstration in the country since the Beijing
crackdown drew 50,000 people in Shanghai on Friday, but with the
highly publicized arrests of labor leaders and some students over
the weekend, protesters have disappeared from Shanghai's streets.
   Litke said police who detained the ABC crew ``were very cordial,
but they would not let us leave. The family looked a mixture of
nervous, frightened and sad.''
   The police took away the ABC interpreter for about two hours and
told him that ``we were all on tourist visas and breaking the rules,
and if we wanted to work we must get permission from Beijing,'' said
Litke, who is based in Hong Kong.
   ``They told him if we continued working here then we would be
going down a `dangerous path,''' Litke said. ``They never ordered us
out, but when our translator suggested we might leave today, they
said that would be a very good idea.'' He said he would leave for
Hong Kong later Tuesday.
   On Saturday, British TV journalist Peter Newport was expelled
from China.
   Newport, of Britain's Independent Television News, was detained
as he photographed a protest by about 200 students in front of
Shanghai police headquarters.
   Newport has been the only foreign journalist expelled during the
current crisis in China, although reporters have been warned in
Beijing and Shanghai that they cannot engage in news gathering
without explicit permission from central or local authorities.
   U.S. diplomats in Shanghai were prepared to protest the ABC
incident, but did not because the Americans were not arrested or
expelled, said William Palmer, a spokesman at the U.S. Consulate.
   The Chinese ``are obviously watching very closely,'' Palmer said,
with several journalists reporting being followed.
   Only about 100 Americans remain in Shanghai and in the
neighboring provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, Palmer said.
   ``We're still advising Americans to leave. We don't think its
advisable to stay in Shanghai,'' Palmer said.
   Also on Tuesday, the British Consulate said it has not received
word from Chinese officials concerning Yao Yongzhan, a student from
Hong Kong at Shanghai's Fudan University.
   Yao was with British students and two officials from the British
Consulate when he was detained Sunday on grounds he had not
registered with security authorities and was in possession of what
the Chinese press called ``contraband materials.''
   British Consul Ian Orr had not been able to meet with officials
of China's Foreign Ministry to discuss Yao's case, said Vice Consul
Ian Cormack.
   In London, the Foreign Office said it had told China's top
diplomat in Britain that Yao ``should be immediately returned to
Hong Kong. Any maltreatment by the Chinese authorities of the Hong
Kong Chinese would have the most damaging impact in confidence in
Hong Kong.''
   Hong Kong, a British colony, is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.

   President Bush has nominated Lt. Gen. John W.
Foss for a promotion and new assignment as the next commander of the
Army Training and Doctrine Command, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Foss will receive his fourth star
and the rank of full general. He will replace Gen. Maxwell R.
Thurman, who is going to retire on Sept. 1, the Pentagon said.
   Foss, 56, a native of Hutchinson, Minn., is currently serving as
the Army's deputy chief of staff for operations and plans, and also
as its senior member on the military staff committee assigned to the
United Nations.
   Thurman, 58, a native of High Point, N.C., has overseen soldier
training programs for the Army since June 1987. He is retiring after
more than 36 years of active-duty service.
   In a related move, the Pentagon announced Tuesday that Bush had
nominated Maj. Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan for his third star and a new
assignment replacing Foss in his current job as deputy chief of
staff.
   Sullivan, 51, is a native of Boston who is currently serving as
the commander of the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas.

   Rep. Julian Dixon, chairman of the House ethics
committee, said Tuesday there was no connection between the panel's
hiring of the president of the Los Angeles airport commission in
1986 and a lucrative investment by Dixon's wife in shops at the
airport.
   Dixon said Johnnie L. Cochran, a Los Angeles attorney, was paid
$170,000 in 1986 and 1987 for legal work for the ethics committee.
   ``I did hire Cochran to do work on the St Germain case,'' Dixon,
D-Calif., said in a telephone interview.
   The ethics committee looked into the personal finances of Rep.
Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., and concluded in 1987 that any
improprieties did not warrant further investigation. St Germain was
defeated in his 1988 re-election bid.
   Two months after the House committee retained Cochran on Feb. 5,
1986, the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners awarded a
concession to run seven duty-free stores at the airport to a joint
venture headed by Duty Free Shoppers Inc. of San Francisco.
   At that time _ April 1986 _ Cochran was president of the airport
board. He is no longer president, but remains on the five-member
board.
   Other companies in the joint venture were Mir Kanon Inc., a
minority enterprise, and Peideau Inc., a female-run business. City
policies required that minority and female-run businesses be part of
any concession handed out by the airport.
   In July 1986, Dixon's wife, Betty, bought a 12 percent interest
in Mir Kanon and Peideau. This investment earned her over $150,000
in 1987 and 1988, according to Dixon's financial disclosure forms
for those years.
   ``There was no connection ... I want to make this as strong as I
can ... no connection between the hiring (of Cochran) and Mrs.
Dixon's business,'' Dixon said. ``I have never discussed with
Johnnie Cochran anything about Betty Dixon's business.''
   Cochran said he didn't know Mrs. Dixon was part of the duty free
concession until about a year ago.
   ``At no time did Julian and I ever talk about it'' until recent
weeks, said Cochran.
   Cochran said he voted to give Duty Free Shoppers the concession
on April 30, 1986, but he was not part of the committee that
recommended the firm.
   Dixon recently gained national exposure when he presided over the
ethics committee's investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright, who
resigned after the panel charged him with 69 violations of House
rules. Among other things, the committee said Wright's wife, Betty,
accepted improper gifts from a wealthy Texas businessman,
allegations Wright denied.
   Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who succeeded Wright as the House
speaker, said he knew of nothing amiss about Mrs. Dixon's business
or her husband's decision to amend his 1986 financial disclosure
form.
   ``As far as I know, there is no impropriety of any kind, and the
refiling is in accordance with the rules,'' he said.
   Dixon said Cochran, an ``outstanding lawyer,'' was hired by the
ethics panel ``based on his qualifications and the qualifications of
his law firm.''
   Meantime, airport officials are examining the contract with Duty
Free Shoppers and the two other firms to make sure they are legal
and meet the intent of the city's minority contracting policy.
   Duty Free Shoppers said Mir Kanon and Peideau make up 32 percent
of the concession for the seven duty-free shops, and 18 percent of
the concession for the 18 gift and news shops at the international
airport, the third-busiest in the world.
   Dixon revealed Monday that his wife paid between $5,000 and
$15,000 for her investment in the two companies in 1986. He filed an
amended financial disclosure statement in response to questions from
The Associated Press.
   In his earlier 1986 financial disclosure form, Dixon said the
investment was worth between $100,000 and $250,000 at the end of
1986, meaning the value of the shares soared in a six-month period.

   The United States should pursue a new claim that
American servicemen are being held prisoner in Vietnam and seek
their release, a former congressman said Tuesday.
   William M. Hendon, chairman of the POW Publicity Fund based in
McLean, Va., was in Japan to speak with the daughter of a Japanese
man who says he shared a prison cell with Americans in Vietnam.
Iwanobu Yoshida was freed in January after 14 years in captivity.
   ``This latest report represents a window of opportunity for the
United States to try to gain the release of those prisoners of war
still alive inside Vietnam,'' Hendon said.
   Vietnam's embassy in Tokyo denied reports that it still holds
American POWs, calling Yoshida's story ``an absolute lie.'' Vietnam
has said repeatedly it does not hold any American prisoners from the
Vietnam War.
   The United States lists 2,364 people missing in action from the
war.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Karl Olsson said Washington would study
information collected by an American military attache who met with
Yoshida on Sunday.
   Yoshida, 65, is hospitalized in his hometown of Sapporo on the
northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, 520 miles northwest of
Tokyo. The hospital says he suffers from mental disorders and a
speech impediment.
   Hendon met Yoshida's daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, on Monday but was
unable to see Yoshida, who has refused to see other visitors since
meeting with the U.S. official. Yoshida has said he shared a cell
with three Americans and saw others while in Vietnamese prisons.
   After becoming a Buddhist monk in 1966, Yoshida left his family
and emigrated to Vietnam, where he set up a temple in Saigon, now Ho
Chi Minh City. He became a South Vietnamese citizen in 1973.
   Yoshida was arrested in 1975 after communist forces took over
South Vietnam. On Jan. 20, Vietnam released him for humanitarian
reasons after appeals were filed by international human rights
groups.
   Hendon is a former congressman from North Carolina and former
Pentagon consultant. His organization, the POW Publicity Fund, was
set up to publicize a $2.5 million reward offered by 21 congressmen
for the return of an American POW to U.S. custody.

   Fire swept through a home in a small
farming community, killing seven people, including four children,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Monterey County Sheriff's Sergeant Glen Brown said a call Monday
night alerted police and fire officials, but by the time they
arrived the home, a converted candy factory, was fully engulfed in
flames.
   Volunteer Fire Chief Eddie Banuelos said witnesses reported a
muffled explosion was heard shortly before the fire erupted, but
there was no immeidate word on what might have caused it. The
Monterey County fire and arson investigation team was called.
   The coroner's office said a 30-year-old man and two women, 23 and
20, were found in the charred ruins, along with the children.
   Brown said the seventh victim, an 8-year-old girl, escaped the
home but died later at a hospital.
   A 9-year-old boy survived after being pulled from the flames.
Brown said the boy told investigators he was awakened by his mother,
who said the kitchen was on fire and to get out of the house.
   An uncle, Samuel Garcia, identified the boy as Freddie Pacheco.
Officials said the boy was hospitalized briefly before being
released into the custody of an aunt.
   ``This is the worst I've seen in 21 years here,'' Acting Police
Chief Mike Romo said. ``It's just devastating they didn't get out. A
thing of this magnitude, when you have multiple numbers of bodies,
and particularly children, it's a very emotional situation.''
   Garcia identified the dead adults as his brother, Artemio Garcia;
his wife, Olga Pacheco; and a Garcia cousin, Maria Graviela.
   The children were identified as Abel Garcia, 1{; Yaqueline
Pacheco, 5; Rosario Pacheco, 7; and Graviel Graviela, 1. Graviela
was the child of Maria Graviela; the others were offspring of Garcia
and Pacheco.
   Greenfield is about 130 miles south of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Administration Praised for Allowing Sale of Butter to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the House and Senate
agriculture committees praised the Bush administration Tuesday for
allowing the sale of surplus U.S. butter to the Soviet Union.
   ``Weeks ago, President Bush called me at home to talk about the
Soviet wheat sale,'' said Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., of the
Senate Agriculture Committee. ``I told him I would support him, but
urged him to consider the Soviet offer to buy our surplus butter.''
   Leahy said he was glad Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
``took my advice and is prepared to go ahead with the sale.''
   ``It makes more sense to sell surplus butter to the Russians than
to store it,'' he said.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
also praised the move.
   ``I support the sale of any agricultural commodity which we have
in surplus which can be sold on the world market at a reasonable
price.''
   Yeutter announced Monday that 75,000 metric tons of surplus
butter could be sold to the Soviets at prices to be negotiated.
   His department has estimated that 135,000 to 140,000 tons of
butter will be in the U.S. surplus inventory by Sept. 30. This
compares to 73,165 metric tons in September 1988.
   Recent reports from the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
indicate the taxpayers have about $1.47 per pound invested in the
surplus butter, or around $3,241 per metric ton.

   The installation of vapor recovery
nozzles at thousands of California gasoline pumps has made ``a major
contribution to clearer air,'' and motorists' early complaints have
vanished, state officials say.
   ``We did have complaints at the beginning, largely because the
nozzles were so different from the hoses people were accustomed to
... and they were bulky and heavy,'' said Bill Sessa, spokesman for
the California Air Resources Board.
   ``Unfortunately, this program began at about the same time most
stations were converting to self-service, so that compounded the
problem. The first hoses were designed for attendant use,'' Sessa
added.
   But now, he said, ``I can't remember when I heard the last
consumer complaint. Our program seems to have been accepted by the
driving public.''
   Although there are still bulky double-hose vapor recovery systems
at many California stations, most now are equipped with light-weight
hoses which look and feel to the motorists like the pre-regulation
hoses.
   The nozzles are designed to capture air pollution-causing
hydrocarbons that evaporate from gasoline when it is pumped into a
car's gas tank. A vapor-lock system routes the vapor back into the
station's underground holding tanks, where some of it condenses back
into liquid.
   California ordered vapor-recovery nozzles at service stations in
urban areas, where the smog problem is greatest, in 1977. A phase-in
period covered 90 percent of the state's 14,000 stations by 1980.
Regulations adopted in 1987 extended the requirement to stations in
rural areas, with the final few hundred due for conversion in the
next six months.
   New Jersey required the state's larger stations to have the
nozzles Jan. 1; smaller stations must comply by next year. New York
City, the District of Columbia, St. Louis and several Florida cities
have similar laws.
   Legislation to enact similar programs is pending in
Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Oregon, said S.
William Becker, executive director of the Association of State and
Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators in Washington.
   Consumer complaints in California have diminished, agreed Art
Boswell, spokesman for the California Service Station and Automotive
Repair Association. But that doesn't mean there aren't still
problems, he said.
   ``The biggest complaint is they're bulky and heavy. When you get
a lady of 110 pounds trying to maneuver a double-hose system, it's
obviously a problem,'' Boswell said.
   He said the other major concern of the service station owners is
installation and operating costs.
   The vapor recovery nozzle that the motorist sees is only one part
of the recovery system. A network of pipes must be installed to
return the vapor to the storage tanks.
   Then the delivery tanker truck must be equipped with a larger
version of the recovery nozzle to collect vapor from the station's
storage tank and return it to the refinery for reprocessing.
   Boswell said that adds $3,000 to $5,000 to the cost of a new
station, but at least $10,000 to $15,000 to convert an existing
station. In addition to that, the pumps have higher maintenance
costs, adding $1,500 to $2,000 a year to the average station's
operating expenses.
   ``The old nozzles cost $15 to $20 each. Vapor recovery nozzles
are over $100, and the new light-weight ones are $300 per nozzle,''
he said, ``so it does make the price of gasoline go up.''
   Boswell said the conversion costs have led to closures of some
small stations.
   ``It does a good job of collecting vapors. There's no dispute
over that,'' Boswell said. ``But on-board canisters on the vehicles
do a better job.''
   Sessa said California's battle against air pollution involves so
many inter-related actions _ including emission standards on
vehicles, vapor recovery at service stations, and industrial plant
emissions _ that it is impossible to sort out the exact effect of
just one program.
   But he described the vapor recovery requirement as a crucial
component to the air quality effort because it reduces the amount of
hydrocarbon gases in the atmosphere.

<HEAD>Pentagon Awards First HDTV Contracts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government formally joined a
high-stakes technology battle with Japan on Tuesday when a Pentagon
agency picked five companies to receive government grants to develop
high-definition television.
   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that it
would immediately open negotiations with the five over how much
money to give them.
   The agency has committed roughly $30 million to the
high-definition, or HDTV, technology program and has received 87
requests from corporations and laboratories for money.
   The Pentagon said it could not predict how many other contractors
might receive grants.
   There will definitely be other contractors selected, however,
because the five selected Tuesday are all working on the displays _
or what amounts to the picture tube in a standard TV _ for the new
technology, the agency said.
   Other grants are contemplated to companies working on
high-definition ``processor technology'' _ the computer brains
needed to allow HDTV systems to receive, manipulate and display
pictures, maps or video.
   Four of the five companies selected Tuesday are working on
so-called ``projection displays,'' while the fifth is working on a
``plasma flat panel display'' similar to the liquid-crystal displays
found on many watches and portable computers, DARPA said.
   The four working on projection displays are NewCo Inc. of San
Jose, Calif.; Raychem Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif.; Texas Instruments
Inc., of Dallas, and Projectavision Inc. of New York City.
   The firm working on plasma displays is Photonics Technology Inc.
of Northwood, Ohio.
   NewCo has told the Pentagon it is working with a subcontractor
identified as Spectra Physics Inc. Raychem has listed the Xerox
Corp. as a subcontractor. Texas Instruments has listed the David
Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., as a subcontractor.
Projectavision has not identified any partners.
   Texas Instruments also is working on the plasma display
technology as a subcontractor to Photonics Technology. The
University of Michigan also is on the Photonics team.
   The Pentagon's primary goal is developing an advanced, small
TV-type screen that can display text, characters or video signals
with great clarity. The monitors would be used inside new
helicopters and airplanes, training simulators, other types of
vehicles and ommand centers.
   The department also hopes, however, that by providing money for
new research, it can help U.S. electronic and semiconductor
companies take the lead in developing the next generation of TV sets
for commercial use.
   High-definition television offers the promise of sharper,
brighter and wider pictures.
   A study by the Economic Policy Institute released in March
concluded the United States must move aggressively into the new HDTV
and flat-screen display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs
annually and suffer a $225 billion trade deficit in electronic goods
by the year 2010.
   If the United States does not compete effectively with the
Japanese and other nations in the high-technology arena, the
personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have
respective deficits of $114 billion and $76 billion early in the
next century, the report said.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has estimated that HDTV sales
in this country could reach $140 billion in the next 20 years.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Safety of Planned Waste Dump Unproven</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has failed to show it can
ensure the safe operation of a nuclear waste dump in New Mexico and
may be unable to meet its September target for opening the
repository, a House committee chairman said Tuesday.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said in an interview that Energy
Secretary Jmes D. Watkins may be moving too fast on the $700 million
project, a central feature of Watkins' plan for cleaning up the
enormous amounts of hazardous wastes that have been ``temporarily''
stored at nuclear weapons plants for 40 years.
   ``There is no crisis that requires us to move so quickly,'' said
Synar, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources.
   A spokeswoman for the department said it planned to go ahead with
the first shipments of radioactive waste to the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, 2,150 feet below the desert near Carlsbad, in September
despite mounting congressional criticism.
   ``We're still of the opinion that we can do it,'' said Christina
Sankey.
   A failure to open the repository in September could have serious
ripple effects on the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex,
which includes 16 major plants in 12 states.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, for example, has said he will not accept
further shipments of radioactive wastes from a Colorado weapons
plant beyond September. The Rocky Flats plant, near Denver, has no
room to store its wastes and so might have to close down if Idaho
carries out its threat to block further shipments.
   Wastes from Idaho, Colorado and other weapons sites was supposed
to have begun moving into the New Mexico repository last October,
but the opening was delayed because federal officials could not
verify the safety of the design and construction.
   In setting his September deadline, Andrus sought to force a
speedup of the New Mexico project. Idaho is concerned not only about
waste coming into the state from Colorado, but also about a
continuing buildup of hazardous waste generated at the department's
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls.
   At a hearing before Synar's subcommittee Monday, the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, presented a
legal opinion that any move by Andrus to block further waste
shipments into his state would be unconstitutional.
   Synar also criticized the Energy Department's training of
emergency response officials in the states that will be traversed by
the waste shipments. The training is designed to ensure that local
police, firefighters, doctors and others could respond to an
accident involving the radioactive material.
   ``They've done good training, but they don't have adequate
records to find these people in the event they were needed,'' Synar
said.
   The dump is designed to permanently entomb about one million
barrels of wastes from the manufacture of nuclear weapons
contaminated with plutonium, which remains radioactive for 24,000
years.
   At a hearing before his subcommittee Monday, GAO officials raised
numerous objections to the department's plan for determining the
suitability of the waste repository.
   Keith Fultz, director of the GAO's energy issues office, said,
``In our opinion, DOE has not yet satisfactorily addressed all key
issues.'' He criticized the department's plan for putting about
7,000 barrels of waste in the repository in an initial 5-year period
testing period.
   ``Most of the waste that DOE would store ... before making a
preliminary determination of compliance with EPA's standards is not
essential for that purpose,'' he said.

<HEAD>EPA Says Industry Polluting Waterways in 45 States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of industrial plants spread across 45
states are violating water quality standards by releasing toxic
chemicals into public waterways and must take steps to curb the
pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday.
   Rebecca Hanmer, EPA's assistant administrator for water, said the
state standards involved, under federal guidelines, are designed to
protect aquatic life and the levels do not necessarily pose a health
threat to humans.
   However, EPA officials said the statistics provide the most
detailed picture to date of the extent of water pollution from toxic
chemical releases by industrial plants and make clear a need for
tighter controls.
   The agency said all but a handful of states have at least some
waterways that are contaminated beyond what the government considers
environmentally safe because of industrial releases of 126 toxic
chemicals, including a variety of substances believed to cause
cancer.
   Ms. Hanmer said in most cases the companies or government
entities involved have proper permits and are not violating any
laws. But they are under a federal directive to develop cleanup
strategies to comply with the standards by a mid-1992 deadline.
   The EPA provided no information on levels of releases into
specific waterways.
   The polluters include not only industry, but a dozen federal
facilities and 240 local water treatment plants that often are
discharging pollutants from industrial sources.
   The greatest concentration of releases stems from plants in the
metal finishing, pulp and paper and natural gas industries, which
account for better than 40 percent of the industrial polluters cited.
   Among the polluters also were several military bases, Energy
Department facilities and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., in
Alaska, which has been told to tighten its controls on dumping
contaminated water used as ballast in oil tankers.
   About 40 percent of the 879 polluters cited have submitted plans
approved by the EPA to bring the toxic releases into compliance by
1992. The remainder have either submitted plans that were rejected
or have yet to submit a compliance program, officials said.
   The EPA findings, gathered from the states, indicated that:
   _ 879 facilities in 45 states were releasing toxic chemicals into
nearby waterways beyond what government standards consider
environmentally safe for aquatic life.
   _ The releases include a broad range of chemicals including
benzene, mercury, nickel, lead, asbestos, arsenic, cyanide and
dioxin.
   _ Nearly 600 stretches of waterway are affected by the releases
to a degree that they are in violation of state quality standards.
   _ Contamination of waterways by at least some of the 126 toxic
chemicals was found in all but five states: North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Hawaii and Vermont. The largest number of
polluters were found in Pennsylvania, Washington state, Wyoming and
Indiana, although EPA officials said in some cases a state had more
polluters because of tougher state standards.
   EPA officials suggested that while the statistics from the states
provide the best indication so far on the scope of industrial
pollution of the nation's waterways, they likely represent only a
fraction of the harmful chemicals that are being released into
lakes, rivers and streams.
   The statistics cover only 126 toxic chemicals and do not take
into account pollution that comes from ``nonpoint'' sources such as
runoffs from agriculture and mining.
   If those sources are taken into account, said the EPA, more than
17,000 stretches of waterway, as much as 10 percent of all of the
country's streams and shoreline, are believed to have levels of
chemical contamination that warrants corrective action.

   Framed against majestic,
snow-streaked mountains, President Bush rallied Americans on Tuesday
to support his plan for combatting air pollution, saying, ``Nature
needs our help.''
   Bush also touted use of alternative fuels to gasoline, saying
that clean-burning fuels ``are going to take the market by storm''
and help the nation achieve his goal of clean air in every American
city within 20 years.
   One day after unveiling a proposal for cleaning up acid-rain
pollutants, smog and toxic chemicals from the air, Bush declared,
``Environmental gridlock must end.''
   Despite disputes among energy, mining, chemical and environmental
groups about what to do, Bush said, ``There's one thing everyone
agrees on. We need action. And we need it now.''
   He said competing interests in Congress have ``jammed the avenue
to action'' for more than a decade.
   Bush spoke to an audience of more than 1,000 residents and
tourists in a field at Teton Science School. The craggy, snow-filled
Teton Mountains served as his backdrop. Brilliant blue skies and a
blazing sun helped make it a picture-perfect day.
   Before returning to Washington, Bush stopped at the University of
Nebraska in Lincoln for a speech in which he pledged support for
research on alternative fuels such as ethanol.
   On the flight to Lincoln, Bush was notified the White House had
received from Congress legislation to raise the minimum wage by
$1.20 an hour _ to $4.55. Bush ordered that it be sent back with his
veto, and the bill returned Capitol Hill 59 minutes after it arrived
at the White House.
   In Lincoln, Bush spoke before an enthusiastic crowd of thousands
in a sports center. He said ``alternative fuel is going to help us
reconcile the automobile to our environment.''
   After touring an engine-technology laboratory where tests showed
that fuels blended with ethanol, made from fermented corn and
agricultural wastes, burn cleaner than gasoline, Bush said, ``We
know it's time to cut exhausts. The question is how.''
   He called alternative fuels ``an American answer'' that can help
reduce the country's dependence on imported oil.
   Bush drove an ethanol-powered Chevrolet Corsica compact around a
test track twice, with Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr in the passenger's seat.
   He said later, ``I don't do a lot of driving these days, so I'm
not sure that I'm the best judge, but I enjoyed the ride and it had
a lot of pickup _ certainly got more pickup than the 14,000-pound
(presidential) limousine sitting outside this place.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency says vehicles that can use
both gasoline and methanol, a fuel distilled from natural gas or
wood, give off 30 percent less tailpipe pollution, while vehicles
that use only methanol show an 80 percent reduction.
   Bush's clean-air proposals won general praise from
environmentalists, who said his package will be the framework for
the first overhaul of the Clean Air Act since 1977.
   In particular, environmentalists cheered the fact that the
initiative originated at the White House after eight years of
silence on environmental matters from Ronald Reagan.
   In the pristine wilderness of the Grand Teton National Park, Bush
said every American deserves to breath clean air. ``And you
shouldn't have to drive 2,000 miles to come out here to do it.
Environmental gridlock must end.''
   On Monday, Bush toured a fire-blackened geyser basin in
Yellowstone National Park.
   He told the Teton audience that he marveled at nature's
regenerative power but said, ``whether restoring a forest or the air
that flows above it, nature needs our help.''
   Bush said the medical wastes that washed up on East Coast shores
last year and the wandering garbage barge that nearly couldn't find
a port ``helped provide the jolt we that needed'' for environmental
action.
   ``Some say we are running out of time,'' Bush said. ``Wrong. the
only thing we are running out of is imagination and the will to
bring what we can imagine to life.''
   Repeating his oft-stated phrase that ``there is a new wind
blowing,'' Bush said that ``borne upon that wind is a new breed of
environmentalism.
   ``Our mission is not just to defend what's left _ but to take the
offense, to improve our environment across the board.''
   Bush said, ``Even the Tetons cannot escape the threat of
pollution. It comes not from steam engines and logging saws (which
threatened the park in earlier years) but from the very West Wind
that shaped those peaks, bearing the often invisible poisons that
gust in from the sun-baked smog of our cities.''
   Bush, who has visited the Tetons several times, said he
frequently hears people say how nice it is to get away from urban
pollution.
   ``Well, the bad news is, it can follow you here. But the good
news is, we're not going to put up with it any longer. Not here. Not
at home where you summer visitors live most of your lives.''
   Bush used his speech to announce his selection of John Turner, a
Wyoming state senator, as director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. Turner owns a ranch in Jackson Hole.
   National Park Service police removed several demonstrators before
Bush arrived for his speech. The protestors had signs denouncing
Bush's handling of the Valdez oil spill. Jim Northup of the National
Park Service said they were arrested for demonstrating in a national
park without a permit and were taken to the Teton County Jail.

   Howard Simons, former Washington Post
managing editor who helped oversee his paper's coverage of the
Watergate scandal, died Tuesday. He was 60.
   Simons, who last month took a leave from his duties as curator of
Harvard University's Nieman program for journalists, died of
pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said
Harvard spokesman Peter Costa.
   Simons was a Nieman fellow himself in 1958, and then rose from
science reporter at the Post to become managing editor in 1971. In
that role, he helped oversee the newspaper's Pulitzer Prize-winning
coverage of the Watergate scandal.
   A self-described ``First Amendment zealot'' who thought readers
preferred hard news to soft features, Simons once said: ``I think
it's a mistake to apologize to the public for defending the First
Amendment, for screaming the First Amendment.''
   Simons was with The Washington Post for 23 years and sat on the
boards of various organizations, including the board for the
Pulitzer Prize. He was also part owner of The Homer News, a weekly
paper in Homer, Alaska.
   In late May, Simons took an indefinite medical leave from
Harvard. Bill Kovach, former editor of the Journal and Constitution
in Atlanta and a Nieman fellow this past year, was named acting
curator. A search for a permanent curator is under way, Costa said.
   Simons, grandson of a poor Polish cobbler in Albany, N.Y.,
graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1951 and
received his master's degree in journalism from Columbia University
in 1952.
   He worked for Science Service, a Washington news agency, and was
a free-lance writer before joining the Post. He wrote five books,
including the spy thriller ``The Landing,'' which he wrote with
journalist Haynes Johnson.
   In 1984 Simons took charge of the Nieman Foundation, a one-year
fellowship allowing mid-career journalists to pursue a year of
unrestricted study at Harvard with a stipend.
   Post Publisher Donald E. Graham once described Simons as, ``a
wonderful guy and a terrific judge and developer of people, and he
was a tremendous help to this paper.''
   Simons is survived by his wife, Florence, and four daughters.
   No services were planned.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday vetoed legislation
to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.55, swiftly asserting himself
in his first domestic policy clash with Congress and its majority
Democrats.
   Bush, traveling in the Midwest, vetoed the measure less than an
hour after it arrived at the White House, upstaging Democratic
congressional leaders who were still preparing for an event designed
as a final plea to him to sign the measure.
   The Democrats promised to try Wednesday to override the veto,
with new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley saying he would work through
the night seeking the 30 or so additional votes he would need.
Prospects seemed even less positive for the Democrats in the Senate.
   White House aides joked about the speed with which the veto came.
However, Democrats said the swiftness only highlighted insensitivity
to minimum-wage workers who last saw an increase in 1981.
   In a message to Congress accompanying the first veto of his
administration, Bush said the Democrats' bill would hurt those it
was designed to help.
   ``This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' Bush
said in a message that ran more than 1,500 words. He repeated
arguments the administration unsucessfully made in trying to
persuade Congress to adopt a more modest increase, to $4.25 an hour.
   The bill Congress approved ``would damage the employment
prospects of our young people and least advantaged citizens,'' the
veto message said. ``It would accelerate inflation. It would not
help those in poverty. And thus it would fail to properly reflect
the thought behind this measure: to help our lowest paid workers.''
   The Democrats attacked those arguments as unfounded, and promised
to advance another bill should they fail to override the veto. They
also took Bush to task for refusing to support the minimum wage
increase at a time he is seeking to expand capital gains tax breaks
enjoyed primarily by the wealthy.
   ``It is particularly offensive to millions of poor working
Americans that President Bush would veto a bill over 30 cents an
hour at the same time that he is pushing hard to give a
$30,000-a-year tax cut to the very richest Americans,'' Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell said. ``Those are not the proper
priorities for our nation, nor should they be for the president.''
   Robert L. Martin, director of the Chamber of Commerce's employee
relations policy center, said, ``We are encouraged by the
president's action today.'' But Gerald W. McEntee, president of the
American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees, said,
``This veto is a slap in the face of the working poor.''
   Foley, facing a major confrontation with the White House in his
first full week as speaker, refused to answer directly when asked
whether he had any realistic chance of gaining the votes needed to
override a veto.
   ``Hope springs eternal,'' Foley said with a broad smile.
   But even if Foley could deliver the votes in the House, Bush
appears destined to prevail. Thirty-five Republican senators have
signed a letter pledging to back Bush in the veto fight _ two more
votes than the GOP would need to sustain a veto in the Senate.
   The chief sponsors of the legislation, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., vowed to revive the
issue if Bush wins the initial fight.
   ``There will be an increase in the minimum wage,'' said Kennedy,
``If not today, then soon.''
   In his message, Bush again called on Congress to pass his own
proposal, which would boost the minimum wage from its current level
of $3.35 an hour to $4.25 by January 1992. Bush's measure also would
allow employers to pay all new hires a subminimum wage for six
months, a provision he said would prevent most of the job loss he
believes would be triggered by a higher minimum wage.
   Democrats contest the job-loss projections as unfounded and
consider Bush's subminimum wage proposal a cloaked attempt to allow
employers to create a new underclass of low-wage workers.
   The Kennedy-Hawkins bill calls for a $4.55 an hour minimum wage
by October 1991, with the first incremental increase taking effect
this year, and contains a far more restrictive provision allowing a
subminimum to be paid to workers with less than 60 days' work
experience.
   ``My difference with the Congress is not just about 30 cents an
hour,'' Bush said in the veto measure. ``It is about hundreds of
thousands of jobs that would be preserved by my administration's
approach as opposed to those that would be sacrificed under the
excessive increase included in this legislation.''
   Mitchell insisted he was not surprised by the swiftness of the
veto, but the leaders seemed caught off guard. Kennedy and Hawkins
had printed statements urging Bush to reconsider, only to be told by
Mitchell just before the Democrats' event was to begin that his
office had just been informed of the veto.
   White House officials said the bill arrived at the White House at
1:39 p.m. and Bush, traveling on Air Force One from Wyoming to
Nebraska, was notified by a clerk. Bush signed a prepared veto
message he had taken on the trip and at 1:55 p.m. authorized the
White House to affix his signature to another copy of the message
and immediately return it to the Capitol.
   Bush said that if Congress is unwilling to accept his approach
toward raising the minimum wage he would examine the possibility of
raising the Earned Income Tax Credit to help the working poor.
   The credit, originally designed to offset Social Security taxes
paid by the working poor, can be worth up to $874 a year to a
working family with children.

   A report by the Agriculture Department's
drought task force said Tuesday that rains the past month have
helped improve pastures and livestock ranges in much of the nation.
   ``Conditions in 33 states were rated good to excellent, up from
25 last month,'' the report said. ``Oklahoma, Montana, Minnesota and
Wisconsin moved into the top category, while Nebraska, Colorado and
New Mexico are in the severe-drought category.''
   The task force, which is headed by Undersecretary Richard
Crowder, has been meeting each week but will shift to every other
week. The next meeting to review the situation will be on June 27,
the report said.
   In a related report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said that ``numerous intense thunderstorms spread severe
weather and drenching rain across the central and southern plains,
the lower Ohio Valley, and the Gulf and Atlantic coast states''
during the week of June 4-10.
   But dry weather prevailed over much of the northern Great Plains
and portions of the Corn Belt, the report added.
   The winter wheat crop continued in poor shape in much of the dry
area and was said to be in ``mostly fair to poor'' condition during
the week. Harvesting was reported to be 26 percent completed in
Texas, eight percentage points behind normal.
   Corn planted this spring was said to be in mostly ``good to
fair'' condition and that planting was 96 percent complete, three
percentage points behind the usual pace.
   ``Planting continued to lag behind normal in Ohio and
Pennsylvania but reached 90 percent completion in Indiana,'' the
report said. ``In Ohio, corn planting advanced 16 points, reaching
66 percent completion'' by June 10. That was 34 percentage points
behind normal.

   Curios Beijing residents gawked at heavily guarded
Tiananmen Square when they were allowed to cycle and drive around it
Tuesday for the first time since the army seized it from student
protesters June 4.
   Pedestrians were not permitted and soldiers and traffic police
allowed no stopping as bicyclists and cars passed nearly 40 tanks
and armored personnel carriers along the northern edge of the square
and a dozen at the southern end. Rolls of barbed wire lined southern
corners of the 100-acre square, which was nearly empty.
   Soldiers armed with rifles stood every 15 feet along the
perimeter, facing outward.
   The stone slabs that pave the square looked charred and scraped
in places, but there was no other sign of the battle that raged on
its edges the night of June 3-4, when tanks roared in from the east
and west. Some students say the army also fired on protesters inside
the square, but the government denies this.
   Most of the shooting was on Changan Avenue, the main road to the
square.
   The government says nearly 300 people were killed, most of them
soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence say the toll
could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   Tiananmen Square is the physical and symbolic center of Beijing.
On one side stands the former imperial palace, on another the Great
Hall of the People, the current seat of government.
   Protesters traditionally have taken their causes to Tiananmen,
from college students who protested China's ceding territorial
rights to foreign countries in 1919, to the tens of thousands who
occupied the square in April and May to demand dialogue with the
government, a free press and an end to corruption.
   The square also is a favorite place for Beijing residents to
stroll, fly kites and eat popsicles.
   Soldiers quickly cleaned up the students' tents and banners, but
the 10-day delay in reopening the square indicates it took longer to
erase other signs of the occupation and violent recapture. Some
television broadcasts in the past week showed soldiers scrubbing
graffiti off the square's monument to revolutionary heroes and
scraping up charred debris.
   Also opened for the first time in weeks was the imperial palace,
one of Beijing's top tourist attractions. However, visitors were
directed to the north gate and a large portion of the palace
compound in the south, closest to the square, was closed without
explanation.
   Hundreds of Chinese tourists, most from out of town, pressed
their eyes to cracks in the gate of the closed section but could see
only a vast expanse of empty courtyard.
   ``When you stand here it's as if nothing happened,'' a young
woman from the central city of Nanjing said, leaning on a carved
marble baluster and watched birds circle over the palace's yellow
tile roofs.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev took his message
of reconciliation and peace directly to the West German people
Tuesday, and later said the warm welcome in Bonn made him feel as if
he were in Red Square.
   Thousands cheered the Soviet president in Bonn's packed market
square.
   ``I think this is the biggest thing happening in our
relationship, the striving of our people to cooperate and be
friends,'' Gorbachev told the crowd.
   Later he told Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov the welcome
was so enthusiastic he felt ``as if he was on Red Square, among his
own people.''
   Relaying Gorbachev's words, Gerasimov told reporters the
reception made a ``strong emotional impression'' on Gorbachev and
the entire Kremlin delegation.
   More than 3,000 people crowded into the square outside the
18th-century Town Hall under sunny skies to greet the Kremlin
leader. They chanted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' and waved Soviet flags and a
banner saying ``Keep up the good work, Gorby.''
   Cheers and applause rang through the square after the Soviet
anthem was played.
   Several well-wishers fainted in the crush of bodies behind police
barricades.
   Some banners reflected the German pain at the postwar division of
their nation and of the former capital, Berlin, telling Gorbachev
``German unity _ peace in Europe'' and, in English, ``Gorby, make
love not walls.'' That referred to the Berlin Wall.
   But the crowd hooted and hissed in disapproval when Mayor Hans
Daniels, in a brief speech before a ceremonial exchange of gifts,
referred to Bonn as only the temporary capital of Germany,
``substituting for Berlin.''
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa were given a tumultuous greeting as
they emerged from their limousine and ascended the steps of the
newly renovated Town Hall.
   When Mrs. Gorbachev spotted 4-year-old Heinrich-Sebastian
Schilling, clad in traditional leather short pants and waving to
her, she quickly beckoned him to the balcony where she stood with
her husband.
   The couple hoisted the boy between them and Mrs. Gorbachev waved
the posy the youngster gave her as the crowd again chanted, ``Gorby,
Gorby!''
   As police helicopters whirred overhead and sharpshooters scanned
the crowd from rooftops, Gorbachev said: ``We are opening a new
chapter in our relations.''
   After the ceremony, Gorbachev greeted well-wishers behind police
barricades, smiling and shaking hands along the way.
   A weekend poll conducted by the television network ZDF indicates
that 90 percent of West Germans trust Gorbachev and his policies of
reform and disarmament.
   A white-haired woman, who said she lost her brother in the Soviet
Union during World War II, called it ``a great honor'' for Gorbachev
to visit Bonn.
   ``We have great hopes that Gorbachev can offer a new future that
will benefit both Germanys,'' a 21-year-old student, Martina
Feldmann, told The Associated Press.
   Gorbachev said Tuesday he likes Bonn's small-town atmosphere.
   He said of the city's greenery and residential character, ``I
hope you can preserve that.''
   At a welcoming ceremony, he noted that West Germans often refer
to Bonn as a ``big federal village,'' and he added, ``I think in
this case it's good.''
   Bonn, with a population of 300,000 is about the size of
Stavropol, the southern Russian city that Gorbachev managed for many
years as Communist Party chief.
   Gorbachev grew up on a farm in the Stavropol area.
   Bonn was chosen as a temporary capital of West Germany after
World War II by officials who expected someday to return the capital
to Berlin.

   The future of the American newspaper may
depend on such small things as delivering the paper on time and
offering prompt refunds for failing to do so, the president and
chief executive officer of Knight-Ridder Inc. said Tuesday.
   James K. Batten spoke at a general session on the second day of
the three-day convention of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   Much of the first two days was devoted to discussions of
competition from other media for customers and advertisers, and
technology has been a recurring theme.
   However, the real danger to the future of newspapers is not as
much an identifiable competitor as it is the mental attitude of
publishers, editors, reporters, printers and circulation personnel,
Batten said.
   ``I think the real danger lies in assuming that because our
history has been so successful, we can take our continued success
for granted, as some sort of mystical right decreed by the Founding
Fathers,'' he said.
   ``Specifically we have to develop a new, fierce commitment to
publishing newspapers and strain to satisfy our customers every day.
The days when we could do newspapers our way and tell the world to
go to hell if they didn't like the results are gone forever.
   ``If we persist in doing things the way we want to do them out of
ignorance or foolish pride or mule-headedness, our customers are
going to fade away. If we look for ways to tell our customers yes,
instead of no; if we look for quality for the customers, not just
ourselves; if we never take customers for granted; if we make their
satisfaction our central, urgent, day-to-day priority, then our
future will be every bit as good as our past. And as we all know,
that has been very good indeed.''
   One way to satisfy customers is to give to the people who contact
them every day the power to resolve problems and satisfy complaints.
   ``Recognizing that fact, we need to turn the authority pyramid
upside-down, so power flows to the front lines, where customers are
being handled in ways that either please them or frustrate them day
after day,'' he said.
   He said one West Coast newspaper gave its customer-relations
staff its rules for dealing with complaints written on one side of a
small piece of paper. ``It read this way: `Rule No. 1, use your good
judgment in all situations. There will be no additional rules,''' he
said.
   He said that when he took over at Knight-Ridder, he discovered
that some circulation agents lacked authority to give a 25-cent
credit for missed delivery.
   ``Remember that a 10-year personal subscriber is valued at
anywhere from $4,000 to $8,500,'' he said. ``These people were
presiding personally over customers worth from $11 million to $18
million over the next decade, but we weren't empowering them to
extend a 25-cent credit without clearing with the boss. That was
crazy, and we fixed that.''
   He said money-back service guarantees might be one way to keep
subscribers and advertisers happy and advised publishers to
encourage their reporters to get close to their communities.
   Most of it, he said, is just a new way of looking at the business.
   ``Whatever else we do to get closer to readers and advertisers,
we have to guarantee that our newspapers will be their newspapers,
not reporters' newspapers or editors' newspapers or publishers'
newspapers,'' he said. ``We run customers' newspapers.''

<HEAD>Commission Recommends Formalizing Some Aspects of West Point Honor
System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West Point honor system should formally
recognize that every proven violation of the academy's strict honor
code does not result in expulsion, an advisory commission
recommended Tuesday.
   ``If the sanction could feasibly be rehabilitation or
forgiveness, then you would probably be much more willing to turn in
your roommate, or counsel him, (and) he would be more willing to
admit his guilt or explain what he had done,'' said Wesley Posvar,
chairman of the Special Commission of the Chief of Staff on the
Honor Code and the Honor System.
   ``I think in a process like that, these 18- or 19-year-old people
would become more mature.''
   The recommendation was among 25 changes suggested by the group,
which has just completed a six-months study of the honor system.
   One major suggested change was to abolish the term ``quibbling,''
which in academy parlance means intentional deception or untruth
through use of vague or ambiguous language.
   ``But basing charges on ambiguous use of language can produce
ambiguity of guilt itself, and a case can therefore be made for
dropping employment of the word `quibbling,''' the report stated.
   Intentional deception would still be an offense.
   The 13-member commission submitted its report to the secretary of
the Army, who has ultimate authority over the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point.
   Under the code, which states, ``A cadet will not lie, cheat, or
steal, nor tolerate those who do,'' West Pointers are required to
turn themselves in or blow the whistle on classmates for rules
violations. The report said many cadets have been deterred from
following the code, knowing that violators faced possible expulsion.
   Gorden estimated that in the last two years, there have been from
150 to 160 honor cases annually out of a corps of 4,417. Of those
cases, 30 to 40 have gone to trial and six to 12 cadets have been
expelled each year.
   The report also suggested changing the language of the code to
put the onus on unethical acts, rather than on cadets who commit
them. It advocated changing the language of the code to ``A cadet
will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate such acts by other
cadets.''
   Posvar said some of the changes recommended are just codifying
actual practices at the academy.
   ``In fact the superintendent and the authorities have made
certain exceptions in special circumstances, when there are
extenuating circumstances, misunderstanding, poor communication, and
cadets have been retained _ forgiven, if you will _ or
rehabilitated,'' he said at a news conference in the Pentagon.
   ``Therefore, rehabilitated cadets were, as persons, being
tolerated; they were retained. It was the act, it was the act of
lying, cheating or stealing that was prohibited, not the person. Now
that's a fine point but it doesn't change the essence of the code.''
   The report recommended against publishing a rigid schedule of
alternatives to expulsion, but rather ``a general categorization is
appropriate.''
   ``These might include separation (expulsion), temporary
reassignment to a rehabilitating position in the Army, suspension
without pay, or special measure such as counseling, rehabilitation
and probation,'' the study said.
   Brig. Gen. Fred A. Gorden, the West Point commandant, said the
cadets have also recently completed a study of the honor system and
made many of the same recommendations as the commission.
   The commission was established to study the code in an atmosphere
free from concern over a pattern of cases such as the widespread
cheating scandal of 1976, when 136 cadets were expelled, or the
football-based cheating scandal of 1951, which led to 83 expulsions.

   Palestinian leaders in the occupied Gaza Strip
on Tuesday asked U.S. Ambassador William Brown to urge the United
States to step up its Middle East peace efforts.
   The Israeli army demolished four houses and sealed seven others
in the occupied West Bank to punish Palestinians accused of attacks
on troops and on Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   Arabs in Gaza met with Brown as he made his first trip to the
territory, home to more than 700,000 Palestinians, since he became
ambassador in December.
   ``We strongly suggested there has to be more serious intervention
on the part of the United States to get people moving,'' said lawyer
Fayez Abu Rahme, who attended a luncheon meeting with Brown. Two
physicians also participated.
   Rahme said the Palestinians were critical of Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace initiative, which calls for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to select
Palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy settlement for the
lands.
   The Bush administration has backed the initiative but expressed
concern that a lack of details, especially on the final status of
the territories, will discourage Palestinian acceptance.
   Rahme would not elaborate on specific Palestinian requests, but
said participants told Brown ``there can be no elections without a
withdrawal of Israel troops,'' or international supervision. Israel
rejects both ideas.
   U.S. Embassy officials described Brown's visit as ``an
orientation trip'' but gave no details. Brown declined to talk with
reporters.
   At least 516 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising against Israeli occupation of the territories began in
December 1987. Israel has controlled the territories since capturing
them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Palestinian groups opposed to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's
attempts to negotiate with Israel issued a statement in Damascus,
Syria, on Tuesday condemning Egypt for sending a top official to
Israel.
   Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, went
to Jerusalem this week to offer Egypt's services as a mediator
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the
election proposal.
   ``We warn our people to be awake to foil the moves of Ghali and
Arafat,'' said the Palestine National Salvation Front.
   An army spokesman said troops demolished the Palestinian homes
and sealed the others following arrests of Arab attackers.
   They included 49 Arabs in the West Bank town of Nablus accused of
being part of a squad with links to Arafat's Fatah wing of the PLO,
said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules.
   One of the houses sealed was in the Askar refugee camp near
Nablus. The army said cement blocks were thrown from the house in
April, slightly injuring several soldiers.
   Ahmed Shtawi, 42, who owned the house said no one in his family
was detained in connection with the incident and they should not be
penalized for the acts of others.
   The United States and international human rights organizations
have condemned house demolitions, saying they deny people due
process under the law since suspects rarely are tried before their
houses are destroyed.
   The Arab-run human rights group Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man
says the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in the
West Bank and 58 in the Gaza Strip since the start of the uprising.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev told Parliament police arrested two
Palestinian suspects in the murder of Oren Baharami, a 13-year-old
Israeli who was sexually molested and killed in the Tel Aviv suburb
of Jaffa two months ago.
   He identified the suspects as a 26-year-old man from Gaza City
and a 30-year-old resident of Rafah.
   Hundreds of Arab prisoners in northern Israel rioted at Megiddo
military jail for security offenders late Tuesday after soldiers
fired tear gas at prisoners who refused to leave their tent to be
counted, the army said.
   The riot lasted less than an hour and three prisoners were
treated for tear gas inhalation, the army said. Israel radio
reported 22 prisoners injured and 10 hospitalized, and said a cloud
of tear gas floated 2 miles away.

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Uphold Current Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 members of the House sent a
letter to President Bush on Tuesday urging him to uphold all current
anti-abortion policies.
   The 154 lawmakers said they were concerned that efforts will be
made during this Congress to subvert pro-life policies ``by diluting
or repealing laws that prohibit federal funding of or involvement in
abortion, here at home as well as overseas.''
   They urged Bush ``to send an early, clear, and unmistakable
signal of your intention to veto any appropriations or authorization
measure that would undo or weaken current law regarding abortion.''
   The representatives number more than the one-third that would be
needed to sustain a presidential veto.
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Congressional
Pro-Life Caucus, said the letter was not aimed at a particular
effort to change U.S. abortion policy, which prohibits federal funds
to encourage or provide abortions where the life of the mother is
not in danger.
   But he said that with a decision expected soon in a Missouri
abortion case before the Supreme Court, more action on the issue is
expected.
   Smith also said such efforts are likely to be made if Congress
fails to enact a fiscal 1990 budget on time and is forced to fund
government operations with stopgap measures, which continue spending
levels of the year before but allow amendments to slip through more
easily.
   Additionally, he noted that a draft rewrite of the Foreign
Assistance Act in the Senate would reverse two current abortion
policies. One of the current policies bars funding of any
organization that supports coercive abortions as practiced by some
countries, including China. The other bars funding of any
organization that promotes abortions overseas.

<HEAD>Skinner Warns Airlines Who Want to Sell International Routes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner warned
the nation's airlines Tuesday that he would stop the buying and
selling of international routes when it affects competition.
   Skinner, in a letter sent to 28 airlines, asserted the
department's responsibility to review all foreign route sales,
although the Justice Department has had antitrust law authority over
airlines since Jan. 1.
   The action was the latest in a series of steps the Transportation
Department has taken to discourage actions that might inhibit
competition in the deregulated airline industry.
   Skinner earlier expressed concern about proposed takeover of
Northwest Airlines by Pan American or other suitors. Northwest has
so far rejected takeover attempts. He also asked the Justice
Department to look into a planned merger of airline reservation
systems owned by Delta and American airlines.
   Skinner did not mention any specific airline route sale in his
letter, and department spokesman Hal Paris said it was meant to
apply to any potential sale of international routes.
   The Justice Department has already said it would oppose in court
Eastern Airlines' plans to sell its Philadelphia-Canada routes and
other assets to USAir because USAir already has nearly a third of
the flights at Philadelphia.
   ``I view with some concern ... the prospect that carriers might
endeavor to sell these valuable international routes after having
been selected to operate them,'' Skinner said, adding that some
routes might be acquired primarily for their sale value.
   The department approves all applications for international routes.
   Skinner said the sale of routes may affect a carrier's ability to
remain an effective competitor or ``adversely affect industry
balance.''
   In his letter, Skinner said the department would scrutinize all
international route transactions.
   ``Where we find that the competitive and service benefits that we
sought to achieve in making a significant route award would be
undermined by a route sale, we will consider giving the incumbent
carrier the choice of either continuing to operate its service or
relinquishing its certificate in order that the route can be
reawarded through another selection proceeding,'' Skinner said.
   He said the approach was designed to ensure that route sales
``strengthen, rather than diminish, the competitiveness of the U.S.
airline industry.''

<TEXT>
   Ciriaco De Mita, who has been caretaker premier since
his government fell three weeks ago, was chosen Tuesday to form a
new government and said he would try to resurrect the same
five-party coalition.
   He also said no progress could be made in negotiating Italy's
49th government since World War II until after European Parliament
elections Sunday.
   Both De Mita's Christian Democrats and their Socialist rivals had
hoped President Francesco Cossiga would delay naming a
premier-designate until next week, but opposition parties said the
delay had brought most government work to a standstill.
   After meeting with Cossiga, the premier said he would seek to
form a government based on an alliance of parties receiving ``the
constant, growing consensus of Italians.''
   His reference was to several local elections, the latest in
Sardinia last weekend, in which Christian Democrats, Socialists and
smaller parties in the coalition posted gains.
   De Mita resigned May 19 after Socialist leader Bettino Craxi said
he could no longer support the governing coalition. He accused De
Mita of failing to show leadership. Craxi is a former premier and
has made no secret of wanting the job back.
   With nearly all votes counted in the Sardinia election, the
Christian Democrats, long Italy's dominant party, had 34.9 percent
of the vote, up from 32.2 percent five years ago, and the Socialists
13.9 percent, up from 10.1 percent.
   The Communists, the No. 2 party and currently in a slump, dropped
to 23.1 percent from 28.7 percent in the last election. The rest of
the vote went to smaller or regional parties.
   Political commentators said the results showed voters support the
coalition, which also includes the Social Democratic, Republican and
Liberal parties.
   They also noted, however, that the trend has not eased the
rivalry between the Christian Democrats and Socialists.

   Jerry Vines was re-elected president of the
Southern Baptist Convention Tuesday, maintaining the conservative
resurgence within the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
   Vines, pastor of First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Fla.,
captured 56.5 percent of the vote in defeating his moderate
challenger, Daniel Vestal, pastor of Dunwoody Baptist Church in
suburban Atlanta.
   Vines received 10,754 votes to 8,248 for Vestal in the 11th
straight victory for conservative candidates since 1979.
   More than 20,000 messengers, or delegates, registered for the
three-day annual meeting of the 14.8 million-member Southern Baptist
Convention, which opened Tuesday morning.
   Moderates, who came within 700 votes of defeating Vines last
year, had hoped the relatively low turnout for the convention
outside the Bible Belt would work in their favor, with conservatives
unable to bus delegates in for the election. As many as 45,500
delegates have attended recent conventions.
   But conservatives counted on the power of the incumbency. No
incumbent president seeking a second one-year term has lost in
recent years and, until the moderate-conservative controversy,
incumbents rarely encountered opposition.
   In his presidential address before the election, Vines, 51,
delivered a sermon on evangelism, saying it is the one thing all
Southern Baptists can agree on.
   ``It is time for our denomination to get on the go,'' he said.
   Vestal, 44, made his last-minute appeals to voters via
television, paying for half-hour programs on a local station Sunday
and Monday evenings.
   He said in his televised address the election would determine
whether Southern Baptists will be committed ``to openness and
freedom and unity.''
   Both candidates are biblical inerrantists who believe the Bible
is without error, but their different approaches to doctrinal issues
reflect the divisions within the nation's largest Protestant
denomination.
   Vestal said conservatives have been engaged in a power struggle
for control of the denomination that has run roughshod over the
central Baptist belief in the priesthood of the believer, or that
Christians are able to interpret the Bible for themselves.
   ``I think the issue is freedom: Are Southern Baptists going to be
free or are we going to be a controlled denomination? Are we going
to be creedal or non-creedal?'' he said.
   Vines said issues such as whether the world was created in six
days or whether the Bible permits the ordination of women are
matters of interpretation Baptists can legitimately disagree about.
   But he and other conservatives contend there is a need to set
stricter parameters on theological teachings to preserve
denominational unity on central tenants of faith.
   If the truth of the Bible is questioned, Vines said, even the
accounts of the resurrection of Jesus are open to dispute.
   The appointive power of the denomination's presidents allows them
to exert control over its institutions and agencies.
   But moderates have shown increasing strength in recent years,
winning elections at the state level in Texas, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. At last year's
national convention in San Antonio, Vines received just 50.5 percent
of the vote in defeating Richard Jackson, a moderate pastor from
Phoenix.
   The denomination grew rapidly in the '60s and '70s to surpass a
declining United Methodist Church as the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, but has grown by barely more than half a percent each
of the last two years, the lowest growth rate since 1937.

<TEXT>
   Want to buy a ski resort at a bargain, without
leaving the comfort of your living room? It was no problem Tuesday
for bidders in one of the world's largest real estate auctions
conducted via satellite.
   The bid for the Maple Valley ski area in West Dummerston,
Vermont, came from one of the three million satellite dish owners
around the country who tuned into an auction of more than $200
million in real estate.
   Some of them bid by telephone to the auction, which took place at
a convention hall attended by investors and brokers.
   The 370-acre ski area, which sold for $1.2 million, was one of 71
properties in New England, Texas, Florida and South Carolina
auctioned Tuesday at estimated prices ranging from $250,000 to $20
million.
   The parcels were varied. One man got a steal with his high bid of
$35,000 for three houses in Odessa, Texas. One of the biggest
properties was a twin-tower apartment complex near the ocean in
Lynn, Mass., that was expected to sell for about $25 million.
   More than 400 people joined about 100 satellite dish owners who
had pre-registered with the organizers of the event, the
Indiana-based Kruse International, a real estate auction company.
Kruse, along with the Boston-based Investment Network of America,
created the concept of mixing high technology with old-fashioned
auctioneering.
   Kruse held the first satellite real estate auction in November in
Chicago and two more are planned for the fall.
   ``This is the marketing method of the future,'' proclaimed Dean
Kruse, chief auctioneer of Kruse International. ``As telemarketing
grows, buyers and sellers are more comfortable with selling by
satellite.''
   Kruse barked out bids with the distinctive guttural roll of a
veteran auctioneer and sprinkled his bids with the quaint hyperbole
of a rural auction.
   ``This is as good as it gets,'' he crowed during one pitch for an
office complex in Connecticut.
   But as he spoke, he was flanked by two huge video screens that
beamed his likeness and photographs of the properties to the
audience at the Hynes Convention Center and around the country. And
he began many of the bids at well over $1 million.
   Most of the bidders in Boston were serious businessmen who sat
grimly in their seats, scanning the auction brochure for good
investment properties.
   Baker Salsbury, an investor from New Haven, Conn., sat in the
back row, looking harried as he scribbled down bids in a notebook
and pressed the buttons on his calculator to figure out mortgages
and loans.
   ``This is my first time so I don't know what to expect,'' said
Salsbury, who said he was willing to bid a total of between $10 and
$20 million Tuesday. Russell Bard, 51, of Wales, Maine, who came
with his wife, Rita, was more relaxed about raising his hand and
parting with cash. Bard had to defer to his wife when asked which
properties he bid on because he couldn't remember. One of Bard's
highest bids was $2.1 million for a 63,000 square foot industrial
park in Lowell.
   ``I got one property to sell and I'll probably buy a couple,''
said Bard. ``I'm not used to real estate auctions. I usually go to
car auctions.''
   Like others at the auction who registered the highest bids for
each property, Bard said he would not know until the end of the
event if the parcel had been sold to him. The final decision is up
to the seller, all of whom came to represent their properties.

   A senator says attempts by Baltic-American
groups to halt the deportation of those suspected of Nazi war crimes
to the Soviet Union has no connection with his support for the long
fight for freedom in three countries absorbed by the Soviets.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., and Reps. Dennis Hertel, D-Mich.,
and Don Ritter, R-Pa., arranged for a Capitol Hill reception to be
held Wednesday, sponsored by the Joint Baltic American National
Committee and the Baltic American Freedom League, marking Baltic
Freedom Day.
   The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia lost an
estimated 20 percent of their population during World War II through
executions, mass deportations and flight out of the countries.
   Baltic Freedom Day commemorates those Baltic republics and the
people there who died at the hands of the Nazis and during the
Soviet takeover in 1940.
   Riegle said on Monday that the deportation issue ``has nothing to
do with my interest and involvement over many years to try to bring
about what's happening, and that is the unraveling of the Russian
empire.''
   On Tuesday he issued a statement saying, ``I feel personally that
all war criminals must be brought to justice and punished, and I
strongly support the executive branch of our government on deporting
suspected war criminals when the facts warrant.''
   Since the mid-1980s, the committee and the league have attempted
to block efforts by the Justice Department to deport war-crimes
suspects to the Soviet Union for trial.
   The groups, which deny they are pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic, say
they oppose the deportations because the Soviet system lacks due
process and the deportations may constitute diplomatic recognition
of the Soviet takeover.
   The Joint Baltic American National Committee wants all war
criminals, whether communist or fascist, to be brought to justice,
Mari-Ann Rikken, Estonian representative to the committee, said
Monday.
   The organization is ``unhappy with the concept of making the
Soviets an equal partner in justice,'' she said.
   Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates, a research
institute based in Cambridge, Mass., that studies issues related to
authoritarianism and fascism, said some eastern European emigre
movements split over the question of collaborating with the Nazism,
and ``most of the movements that survived intact did so because of
collaboration.''
   After the Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic nations, the
organizations in exile sought to bury their differences in a common
anti-Soviet cause, Berlet said.
   The organizations' anti-Soviet stance has pitted them against the
Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which handles
cases involving Nazi war crimes.
   Anthony Mazeika, at the time vice president of the Baltic
American Freedom League and now a director of the organization, was
active in 1985 efforts to lobby against the OSI's search for war
criminals among Eastern European emigrants.
   Mazeika and officers of the Joint Baltic American National
Committee, through an organization called the Coalition for
Constitutional Justice and Security, also fought the OSI's
deportation in 1987 of Karl Linnas of New York. Linnas was an
Estonian who became an American citizen in 1959 and was sentenced to
death by a Soviet court after his conviction for the deaths of
thousands in a concentration camp in Estonia.
   ``We are not saying that these people are innocent or that
perhaps there could be some guilt,'' said Angela Nelsas, vice
president of the Baltic American Freedom League.
   The organization would like to change the law ``so that American
citizens can receive the same due process of law that is expected in
the United States,'' through criminal trials in the United States,
she said. Neither Hertel nor Ritter responded to requests Monday and
Tuesday for comment.
   The OSI said its only contact with the Baltic groups was when
they were lobbying against a deportation. ``Frankly, I don't pay too
much attention to them,'' said OSI head Neal Shear.

<HEAD>Aquarium's Plan to Display Whales Generates Waves of Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shedd Aquarium is building a huge, $43 million
oceanarium, but it's having trouble obtaining whales to fill the
complex amid waves of protest from activists opposed to capturing
the mammals.
   ``These captures raise havoc with the wild whale population. They
disrupt the family units, other whales are injured and some are
killed,'' said Edward Morlan, director of the Midwest Whale
Protection Federation.
   The federation is one of eight animal rights and environmental
groups that filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in
Washington to block the aquarium from importing from Japan three
Pacific black whales, also known as false killer whales.
   The lawsuit comes a week after Canada's government refused the
aquarium's request for permission to buy three beluga whales from
Hudson Bay-area Eskimos.
   Neither species is considered endangered.
   Despite the objections, there will be whales in the complex when
it opens in fall 1990, said aquarium Associate Director David
Lonsdale.
   ``We were surprised over the controversy,'' Lonsdale said. ``We
feel we are conservationists. We preach conservation in all of our
messages.''
   He said the Canadians were concerned more about where the whales
would be kept before the exhibit opened, and not the exhibit space
itself. The aquarium has said the whales will be housed at an
aquarium outside Chicago while its Oceanarium is completed.
   The Shedd will reapply for a Canadian permit next year, Lonsdale
said.
   As envisioned, the Oceanarium will be a 170,000-square-foot
exhibit with a 2 million-gallon pool for the false killer whales and
a 400,000-gallon pool for the belugas. The $43 million construction
cost is coming from a variety of sources, including state aid.
   The lawsuit said the federal permit Shedd received for importing
the animals from Japan should be revoked until that country bans its
fishermen from killing whales.
   The Japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore and
slaughter them with harpoons or knives, sparing a few for sale to
aquariums, said Sandy Goldberg, an attorney for the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
   Ms. Goldberg said the Department of Commerce permit violates a
U.S. law banning the importation of marine mammals from countries
that don't give the animals the same protection they have in the
United States.
   ``We want to protect the wild populations and stop the killings
in Japan,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``This is no way to do it _ by paying
them to save a few.''
   The other plaintiffs are Greenpeace USA, the Humane Society of
the United States, the American Humane Association, the
International Wildlife Coalition, the Cetacean Society International
and the Animal Protection Institute of America.
   Aquarium officials deny any laws were broken. They contend that
if they didn't import the whales, the animals would be slaughtered,
and that the exhibits benefit people who have no other place to
learn about the creatures.
   ``We're serving an important function,'' Lonsdale said. ``The
educational value of the exhibits is they help people understand
conservationist concerns.''
   While the plaintiffs acknowledge the exhibits help increase
awareness of the whales' plight, many say they oppose confining
creatures that normally range thousands of miles.
   Education ``can't take priority over protecting the animals in
the wild,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``We don't want to protect the whales
by putting them all in aquariums.''
   Lonsdale countered that the aquarium handles marine animals with
utmost care.
   ``We feel we do the best job we can of keeping'' the animals, he
said. ``Their life here is very good. They have a very pleasant
existence.''

<HEAD>Businessmen Protest Killing of Official; Union Leader Disappears</HEAD>

   A police psychologist was slain
Tuesday, a labor leader was abducted and businessmen called a
four-hour strike to protest the killing last week of a senior
Cabinet minister.
   Gunmen killed Miguel Angel Ramirez, a civilian psychologist
employed by the security and investigations department of the
National Police, and his body was found in the eastern suburb where
he lived, police sources said. They blamed leftist guerrillas.
   Stores closed and radio and television stations fell silent at 2
p.m. for the commercial strike to protest the murder last Friday of
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, the closest adviser to President
Alfredo Cristiani.
   The strike coincided with the visit of Vice President Dan Quayle,
who called on the Rodriguez family to express condolences.
   Quayle joined the government in blaming the assassination on
guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
known as the FMLN.
   ``That type of violence was perpetrated by the FMLN and the
leftist guerrillas cannot be tolerated,'' the vice president said.
   Stores that closed put up signs bearing the same words as one on
the Rodriguez home: ``We are in mourning and reject terrorism.''
   Jose Tomas Mazariego, an executive committee member of National
Unity of Salvadoran Workers, the country's largest labor
organization, was seized Monday ``by men in civilian clothes who did
not identify themselves,'' union spokesman Raul Gonzalez said
Tuesday.
   Gonzalez said, ``We believe Mazariego was picked up as he left
the U.S. Embassy. There are witnesses who saw him put in a blue
panel truck while another white car waited, and we have the license
plate numbers of the two vehicles.''
   Mazariego had gone to the embassy for a visa to visit the United
States at the invitation of American labor groups, according to
Gonzalez. But officials at the embassy said Mazariego had already
been issued a visa.
   Mazariego was to have begun the trip Tuesday.
   Gonzalez said the union leader was picked up by government
security men in March and questioned for three days.
   Denys Everingham of Local 1034 of the Communication Workers of
America in Trenton, N.J., said by telephone that Mazariego, an
official of the Salvadoran Telecommunications Union, was scheduled
to speak in Philadelphia on Thursday.
   She said he also was to attend a union meeting Monday in New
Jersey, but added: ``We're not sure if we're going to be having an
event or if we're going to be having a memorial service at this
point.''
   A conservative Salvadoran business group, the National
Association of Private Enterprise, said it sponsored Tuesday's
strike as ``a show of repudiation of all forms of terrorism and an
expression of solidarity with efforts to achieve the peace that the
Salvadoran people yearn for.''
   Leftist guerrillas have fought U.S.-supported Salvadoran
governments in El Salvador for nine years and an estimated 70,000
people have been killed, most of them civilians.
   Rodriguez, 73, was minister to the presidency, the Salvadoran
equivalent of a chief of staff.
   Gunmen who have not been identified killed him and two bodyguards
Friday on a San Salvador street.
   The military and Cristiani's rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance blamed the guerrillas, but but rebels' clandestine Radio
Venceremos said they had no knowledge of involvement by their people.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a top guerrilla commander, told reporters
in Mexico such assassinations were ``not part of any of our plans.''
   Cristiani, who began a five-year term June 1, has said his
government will intensify the war if peace cannot be negotiated.

   Barbara Bush won senior citizens' hearts
and charmed guests at fund-raisers for a Republican congresswoman in
a whirlwind visit to Rhode Island.
   Mrs. Bush arrived at T.F. Green State Airport around 11:30 a.m.,
attended two fund-raisers at a hotel for Rep. Claudine Schneider,
visited a senior citizens center in suburban Cranston and left
shortly after 2 p.m.
   About 30 people waited outside the Omni Biltmore hotel for a
glimpse of the popular first lady, but the Secret Service forced
them out from under an awning and into the rain to make room for her
entourage.
   Mrs. Bush told about 700 people who paid $150 to $1,000 apiece to
attend the fund raisers about her husband's programs and her
campaign for literacy, but didn't mention the campaign Miss
Schneider is contemplating against Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., next
year.
   Asked about the potential Pell-Schneider contest at a hotel news
conference, Mrs. Bush initially ducked the issue. ``I like her just
where she is today,'' the first lady said.
   A few minutes later, she said, ``Claudine Schneider is qualified
for anything. ... I'm just not going to fool around in the internal
politics of Rhode Island. She can be anything.''
   The 42-year-old congresswoman was first elected to Congress in
1980, and has built a reputation as an environmental advocate. She
has yet to declare her plans for 1990.
   The fund raisers raised about $170,000, said Schneider
spokeswoman Bob Rendine.
   At the Cranston Senior Services center, about two dozen
schoolchildren and a handful of adults awaited Mrs. Bush, but the
most they got was a glimpse of her red suit and trademark triple
strand of fake pearls.
   Her folksy, down-to-earth personality, though, won rave reviews
from senior citizens.
   ``There's no airs about her. I think she's great,'' Rose Cirelli
of Cranston said as she watched Mrs. Bush join about 20 people
dancing to the tune, ``New York, New York.''
   Mrs. Bush was less successful as she took several shots with a
pool cue in the center's pool room.
   ``Do I have to call a ball?'' she asked.
   ``No, you have executive privilege,'' a player replied.
   After missing an easy shot, Mrs. Bush turned and said, ``You
ought to see me on the tennis court.''

   A homeless man who spent a rainy night in
a big cardboard box near a loading dock with two friends was killed
while he slept Tuesday morning when the box was flattened by a truck.
   The three homeless men, who had been friends on the street in the
area for the last couple of years, took a carton that once held 10
bicycles from a trash bin behind a Toys `R' Us toy store to shield
them from Monday night's foul weather, the survivors said.
   Along with a dog belonging to the victim, they crawled under the
front of a trailer parked at the store's loading dock, then fell
asleep after drinking beer and alcohol.
   Tuesday morning, truck driver William Kelly, 39, of Bayonne,
N.J., said he was backing up his tractor to connect it to the empty
trailer when he saw the dog jump out of the cardboard box.
   Kelly said he thought there might be puppies in the box, so he
got down to investigate and saw Harold Beres, one of the homeless
men, who shouted angrily: ``There's people in that box! You just ran
over my friend!''
   Police identified the victim as John Spencer, 36. The others
escaped injury.
   Beres, 33, said he was awakened by Spencer's screams. The third
man, Edward Thompson, 30, said he slept through the accident.
   Spencer had been sleeping in the middle of the three men and
apparently the rear wheels of the tractor rolled over his chest,
said Suffolk County Detective Joseph Brock.
   ``He was a real good friend,'' said Thompson.
   Detective Sgt. Joseph Cozine said no charges were filed against
the driver or Toys `R' Us.

<TEXT>
   Scientific researchers in American universities
should be required to disclose financial relationships with industry
that might create conflicts of interest, a congressional
subcommittee was told Tuesday.
   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized within
universities over a relatively short period of time,'' said Sheldon
Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental policy at
Tufts University. ``I have heard it said within the scientific
community that everyone gains from this marriage of academia and
commerce. Nothing can be further from the truth.
   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threaten
the integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken public
confidence in science.''
   Krimsky said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical faculty
at Harvard, as an example, have formal affiliations with 36
biotechnology companies.
   He called for disclosure of financial interests related to
research being conducted by scientists applying for grants.
   Dr. George D. Lundberg, vice president for scientific information
of the American Medical Association, cautioned, however, that
barring researchers from working in areas where they had a financial
interest ``would be devastating, and we would lose many qualified
people and we would lose much information that would have come from
those people if they had worked.''
   ``A lot of things motivate human beings, and money's one of the
big ones,'' Lundberg said.
   He said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking for
somebody to write an article on automobiles, he would have asked
Henry Ford.
   ``Would Henry Ford have been in conflict of interest? Totally,''
he said. ``Would I care? No. I'd love that. He'd know the most about
it.''
   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University who is
suing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on grounds that he
was fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest, said
university researchers ``are free to make undisclosed arrangements
with private corporations in which they often have equally
undisclosed personal roles.''
   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment in
research and many have done so,'' he said. He argued that such
collaboration between universities and industries should be
accompanied by ``proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.''
   Noble criticized MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, in which he
said firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain access
to research publications and other information.
   He told the subcommittee that ``nearly all the member
corporations of the ILP were multinationals with no necessary
allegiance to the United States, that fully half of them were
foreign, that 57 of them were major Japanese competitors, and that
the ILP had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas sales
office in downtown Tokyo.''
   Paul E. Gray, president of MIT, told the panel that the
institution ``would not operate this program were its only benefit a
stream of revenue.''
   ``The educational and research functions of this science-based
university require broadly-based understanding of industrial
practice and industrial needs,''Gray said. ``The ILP is an important
vehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principal
benefit to the institute.''
   Patricia K. Woolf of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton
University, agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but said
the subject needs further study.
   Dr. David Blumenthal, senior vice president of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, said that ``academic research
institutions must insist on disclosure of relationships with
industry that may create economic conflicts of interest.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the human resources
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, said, ``I
am sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some of
the ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, or
manipulated for personal gain.''
   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the
panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the research
community that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.''
   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struck
between avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientific
breakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should not
allow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the way
of overall progress.''

   President Najib said Tuesday it is time
for the backers of Afghanistan's anti-communist rebels _ America and
Pakistan _ to prove their sincerity and offer specific proposals for
ending the civil war.
   ``We ask the United States to consider the realities in
Afghanistan and aim for a peaceful settlement and restoration of
peace,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press at his
office near the Presidential Palace.
   ``We believe that not only American public opinion but
international opinion will demand this because the atrocities by the
opposition inside Afghanistan are against the humanitarian
principles of the United States,'' he said.
   The 43-year-old president spoke of his Marxist government's
efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the war and U.S. and
Pakistani policies.
   President Bush and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan
agreed during their meetings in Washington last week to search for a
political settlement to the Afghan conflict.
   The revolt began after leftist officers seized power in 1978 and
tried to impose Marxism in this predominantly Moslem country. At
least 1.3 million people have been killed in the war and about 5
million Afhans _ a third of the population _ have sought refuges in
neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   Bush and Ms. Bhutto also agreed, however, that the United States
should continue providing weapons to the rebels and seek an end to
Najib's rule.
   ``It is too early to determine whether they are serious and
sincere,'' Najib said of the two leaders.
   ``How can one talk about a political settlement and reject one
side in the conflict _ the government of Afghanistan?,'' he asked.
``Rendering military assistance to the armed opposition means
nothing but continuing war. Rendering military assistance to those
who openly refuse a political settlement actually means continuing
war and bloodshed and therefore preventing a political settlement.''
   The guerrillas refuse to negotiate with Najib but their campaign
to topple his government has stalled. There are doubts within the
U.S. administration that the fractious rebel alliance based in
Pakistan will succeed.
   Pakistani officials have said the guerrillas could negotiate with
the Kabul government if Najib and prominent members of the governing
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan were removed from power.
They also expressed hope the United States can press Moscow to drop
its insistence that the party be part of any future government.
   Najib, a physician, was tapped by the Soviets in May 1986 to
replace Babrak Karmal and then was elected president in November
1987 by the Grand National Assembly, the highest governing body in
Afghanistan.
   He has said he would step down if that would guarantee peace in
his war-devastated country.
   After the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan on Feb. 15, many in
the West predicted the government would collapse within weeks or
months. The guerrillas switched from hit-and-run tactics and
launched a frontal assault on the eastern city of Jalalabad in early
March and later offensives on the southern cities of Khost and
Kandahar.
   But the Afghan armed forces held their ground, bolstering the
government's confidence.
   ``How do we look weak or strong?'' Najib asked, speaking through
an interpreter. ``They haven't had a single military victory. How
should we feel?''
   With his troops able to stand alone, Najib has stepped up calls
for a cease-fire, peace talks and formation of a coalition
government, to be followed by election of a new government.
   He has appealed to some guerrilla field commanders and their
fighters to accept a truce. Major commanders rejected his offer but
Najib said about 60,000 guerrillas agreed to stop fighting and
negotiations were continuing continued.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 and sent
more than 100,000 military personnel into the country to help the
government.
   Najib directed many of his remarks toward Washington.
   ``Children ... are being killed in cold blood. Is that what Mr.
Bush would want for the American children? Everyday hundreds of
women are grieving over the loss of their loved ones. Is that what
Mr. Bush would want for American women?'' he said.
   ``Does the United States want fundamentalists, extremists and
terrorists or a government based on democratic principles,
nonaligned and neutral. Hasn't the United states tasted the bitter
pill of extremism?'' he asked, possibly referring to Iran's
fundamentalist Islamic government. ``Does it want another one in
Afghanistan?''
   Najib said, ``Our position is crystal clear _ the only practical
and realistic solution for the cessation of war between all sides is
to sit around a negotiating table and form a colaition government.''

<HEAD>Customs Said Planning Rewards For Capture of World's Drug Kingpins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Commissioner William Von Rabb is
seeking Treasury Department approval of a plan to offer rewards of
up to $5 million for capture of the world's ``big-time drug
dealers,'' officials said Tuesday.
   Known as ``Operation Paladin'' for the gun-slinging Wild West
character in the television show ``Have Gun Will Travel,'' the
reward fund would tap money from the Customs Service's asset
forfeiture fund, said a congressional source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Customs spokeswoman Kathy Hamor acknowledged the agency is
seeking approval of a plan to offer rewards for help in arresting
international drug kingpins, but said she could not confirm details
of the plan.
   ``It's in the planning stages,'' Ms. Hamor said. ``The
commissioner is seeking approval.'' She declined to say where the
approval would come from.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the bounty would provide rewards from $1 million to $5 million, and
must be approved by the Treasury Department. The source said the
funds could come from the assets forfeited by convicted drug felons.
   The congressional source familiar with the plan said Customs was
drawing up a kind of ``Most Wanted List,'' and that it starts with
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Also being considered for the list are leaders of the ruthless
Medellin and Cali cartels of Colombia, and an alleged drug dealer
from Mexico, the sources said.
   ``There will be opposition to this from within the drug
enforcement community,'' one official said. ``You'll see people
whose turf has been trod upon.''
   Noriega was indicted in Miami last year on charges he violated
U.S. racketeering and drug laws. He is accused of providing
protection and other services for international drug traffickers and
of using Panama as a transfer point for cocaine and marijuana. The
indictment also alleges Noriega permitted laundering of drug profits
through Panamanian banks.
   U.S. authorities say there are two principal trafficking cartels
in Colombia _ one based in the city of Medellin, the other in Cali,
and that they control about 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into
United States.
   Colombian drug traffickers families have been been blamed for the
deaths of an attorney general, a minister of justice, more than 50
judges, more than a dozen journalists and more than 400 police and
military personnel in the past four years.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States is
``blind'' for not recognizing the opposition victory in the May 7
elections, presidential candidate Guillermo Endara said Tuesday.
   He spoke with reporters after talks with a four-man OAS team
seeking to resolve Panama's political crisis that deepened when the
government anulled the May elections.
   The OAS delegation is trying to arrange negotioations between the
opposition, headed by Endara, and the government controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces.
   Prospects appear dim. Noriega had rejected talks and the
opposition insists the only solution is Noriega's resignation a
recognition of its electoral victory.
   ``The way out of the crisis is what the people did on May 7,''
said Endara, who was beaten up by Noriega supporters after the
elections. International observers said the opposition had a winning
margin of 3-1 in the balloting.
   ``The OAS is blind. They don't understand the Panamanian
people,'' Endara said. ``They must understand the people, stop
pressuring them and tell them that what they said on May 7 is what
matters.''
   The OAS group, on its second trip to Panama, met Tuesday with
legislative leaders.
   Celso Carrizo, the pro-Noriega leader of Panama's National
Assembly, said he told the OAS diplomats they first should tackle
the issue of the U.S. role in his country.
   Noriega and his supporters blame the crisis on Washington, which
they accuse of wanting to renege on 1977 treaties ceding the Panama
Canal to local control at the end of the century.
   Washington supports attempts to oust Noriega, who has been
indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges. The
Panamanian leader denies the charges.

   A passenger on an inter-city bus stood up and
began shooting at other passengers Tuesday, killing one person and
wounding two others, then let the driver talk him into dropping his
weapon.
   Perry Tyrone Irvin, 37, of Augusta, was charged with murder and
aggravated assault, said police spokesman Keith Williams.
   Police officer R.M. Thomas said the interior of the bus had blood
``all down the aisle.''
   ``What reason the shooting was for, I don't know,'' said police
Sgt. A. Lincoln.
   The Southeastern Stages bus had originated in Savannah and made a
stop in Augusta before heading to Atlanta. The shooting occurred two
blocks from the Greyhound station in downtown Atlanta, said
Southeastern Stages president Bill Hughes.
   Passengers told police Irvin had lingered in the bus' restroom
before the shooting began. There were 27 passengers on the bus at
the time, the bus company said.
   ``He just got up and started shooting,'' said passenger Jim
Tuttle of St. Simons Island. ``He acted like he hadn't seen them
before.''
   Witnesses said bus driver L.L. Porter talked Irvin into dropping
his weapon, then drove to the bus station.
   Tuttle said the only thing Irvin said was that he had ``hurt all
the people that he was going to.''
   Police said they were not sure if Irvin knew the people who were
shot. The names of the victims were not released.
   Grady Memorial Hospital spokesman Tony Braswell said one
passenger, a man about 40 years old, was in critical condition in
the intensive care unit with a gunshot wound to the head. The other
passenger, a man about 25 years old, was in serious condition with a
gunshot wound to the chest, Braswell said.

<HEAD>Chile Asks for Extradition of Buschmann, Wanted in Pinochet Attempt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile has asked the United States to detain
Sergio Buschmann, wanted in connection with an attempt to
assassinate President Augusto Pinochet, until an extradition request
can be filed, a State Department official said Tuesday.
   Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said Buschmann, an actor turned
leftist guerrilla, was arrested in Anchorage, Alaska, on Monday
during a stopover en route to Sweden after he was deported from
Australia.
   ``This is a legal and diplomatic matter which is being studied by
both (U.S. and Chilean) governments,'' Ms. Beck said, adding that
the United States wants ``justice to be served in this matter.''
   Complicating a Chilean extradition request is Chile's refusal
since 1979 to extradite to the United States Juan Manuel Contreras,
former head of the Chilean intelligence services.
   Contreras and another Chilean is wanted in the United States in
connection with the assassination in Washington of Orlando Letelier,
former Chilean foreign minister.
   Letelier was killed by a remote-controlled bomb planted in his
car in September 1976. Riding in the car with him, and also killed,
was an American assistant, Ronni Moffitt.
   Capt. Armando Fernandez Larios, who surrendered to U.S.
authorities out of remorse for his participation in the Letelier
assassination, said Contreras masterminded the plot.
   Buschmann is wanted in Chile in connection with the Sept. 7,
1986, attempt to kill Pinochet.
   He has said in news conferences since his escape that he played a
key role in the smuggling of a huge guerrilla arms cache into Chile
in 1986.
   Buschmann has been a spokesman for the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front, Chile's principal leftist guerrilla group. Two years ago he
escaped from a prison in Chile, where he faced arms-smuggling
charges.
   He has been granted residence and political-exile status in
Sweden, but he was visiting Australia when the Chileans were seeking
his extradition.
   Rather than extradite Buschmann, Australia deported him last
Saturday. Australian authorities accused him of ``unacceptable
activities.'' He was raising funds for the guerrilla group and
publicly called for the assassination of Pinochet.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Accept Government Offer of Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ethiopian rebel group said Tuesday it accepts a
government offer of peace talks and hopes they will lead to
democracy in this strategic Horn of Africa nation.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, one of the rebel
organizations fighting for autonomy in northern Ethiopia, announced
in London that it ``is prepared to take advantage of any
possibility, however small, to work for a peaceful solution.''
   The Ethiopian Parliament adopted a peace plan June 5 calling for
unconditional talks with insurgents in the presence of an
international observer.
   The Tigre rebels challenged the government to start negotiations
within one month ``to minimize the continuing appalling human and
material costs of the war.''
   But a larger insurgent group, the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front that has been fighting for 28 years for independence of the
province neighboring Tigre, has not responded to the government
proposal.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam ordered the special session of
the Parliament to consider the peace plan less than three weeks
after his Marxist government crushed a coup attempt by war-weary
generals.
   Diplomats said the attempted coup and its failure sent army
morale plunging to new depths, with the morale already low because
of defeats in Tigre and Eritrea.
   The Tigrean rebels, among Ethiopia's many ethnic minorities, want
restoration of democratic rights, an immediate cease-fire, the
release of political prisoners and freedom for exiles to return.
   Their peace plans also calls for dismantling of the government's
``repressive security institutions,'' the expulsion of foreign
military forces, and creation of a provisional government from all
political organizations until a constitution is adopted and a
democratic government elected.
   The Soviet Union is Mengistu's main backer, providing military
aid and support.
   Mengistu inherited the northern insurgencies from the regime of
Emperor Haile Selassie, who annexed the former Italian colony of
Eritrea in 1962. Mengistu ousted Selassie in a coup in Sept. 12,
1974.
   Both the rebel groups and the government espouse Marxism.

   A U.S. cargo plane that crashed
in Antarctica 18 years ago is ready to fly to California after a $10
million effort to recover the aircraft from its icy tomb, officials
said Tuesday.
   The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is to return to the United States on
June 26 now that the three-year salvage effort has been completed,
said Air New Zealand engineering manager Barry Geddes.
   The airline salvaged the four-engine transport aircraft under a
contract with the U.S. National Science Foundation.
   Geddes said a U.S. Navy crew was due in New Zealand this week to
begin test flights before making the long trip to California.
   The plane was heavily damaged when it crashed in 1971 as it tried
to take off from a remote Antarctic airfield. One of the motors on
the fuselage used to assist take-off had broken free, ripping
through an engine and the fuselage. Not one of those aboard was
injured.
   The aircraft was stripped of crucial equipment and left in the
harsh Antarctic environment, where it quickly became covered with 40
feet of snow and ice.
   Geddes said director of polar projects for the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Peter Wilkniss, won permission three years ago to
recover the crashed Hercules. He said a new Hercules would have cost
about $50 million.
   During the early stages of the recovery, another Hercules aiding
the salvage effort crashed, killing two airmen.
   Repair work at the icy site, which included fitting new wings to
the plane, allowed the aircraft to be flown 3,100 miles in January
1988 from Antarctic to Christchurch in New Zealand's South Island.

   Thunderstorms drenched much of the nation's southern half
Tuesday, causing floods that stranded up to 200 people at a trailer
park and forced the evacuation of about 80 people in Oklahoma.
   Flooding caused morning rush-hour traffic jams in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, and the body of a young man swept away by Fort Worth
floodwaters Monday was recovered.
   ``There's flooding just about all over the place,'' Civil Defense
Director T.E. Bingham said in Leflore County, Miss., which received
at least 4 inches of rain.
   The thunderstorms that caused some of the worst problems fell
from eastern Oklahoma to northeast Texas, dumping 4{ inches of rain
on Oklahoma City in seven hours.
   Strong thunderstorms brought strong winds and heavy downpours to
the lower Mississippi Valley from western Tennessee to northwest
Louisiana, and widely scattered storms fell along the Gulf Coast
from northwest Florida to southern Alabama.
   The rains caused many rivers to rise from the southern Plains to
Tennessee. The Trinity River in Dallas was 6 feet above flood stage,
and was expected to rise to 9 feet above flood stage. Flash flood
watches were in effect in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kentucky.
   Flooding prompted the evacuation of about 75 people in Apache,
Okla., nearly 200 miles southwest of Oklahoma City and five children
in Oklahoma City, officials said.
   Water up to 6 feet deep stranded as many as 200 people at a
recreational vehicle park in Oklahoma City, officials said. A nearby
trucking company used a tractor-trailer rig to ferry out residents,
many of them elderly.
   ``Needless to say everybody was traumatized,'' said Lawrence
Klein of Titusville, Fla. ``There will be lots and lots of damage.''
   High water closed several Oklahoma roads and bridges, including
Okalhoma City exit ramps from Interstate 40.
   In Fort Worth, the body of Deryl Pinkston, 18, who was swept away
by swollen Mary's Creek as he and four friends tried to grab a raft
Monday afternoon, was recovered Tuesday at a golf course, police
said.
   Flooding also occurred in the Mississippi communities of
Greenwood, Drew and Ruleville.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for a large section of
central and northeast Texas, and thunderstorms formed over the
northern Panhandle and northern New Mexico.
   Thunderstorms also developed in the Carolinas and Virginia. A
severe thunderstorm watch was in effect in North Carolina, Virginia
and Maryland.
   Rain and drizzle fell from eastern sections of the Dakotas to the
upper Great Lakes region, and scattered showers fell from northern
Ohio to southern Pennsylvania. Showers also fell on parts of New
England.
   Much of the nation's western third had fair weather.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees in Hancock, Mich., and Sawyer Air Force Base, Mich., to 104
in Needles, Calif. The low for the 48 contiguous states was 32
degrees in Houlton, Maine.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from much of the Atlantic Coast to the Great Lakes, the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast, the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley and southern and eastern Texas; scattered afternoon showers
and thunderstorms in central Colorado and the Black Hills of South
Dakota; and showers over much of the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s from the
northern and central Plains to much of the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Coast; the 60s along the central
and northern Pacific Coast; the 90s from the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast to Florida and from south central Texas to inland
California, Nevada and inland Oregon; over 100 degrees in the desert
Southwest and near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in
the 70s and 80s in the rest of the nation.

   A Department of Veterans Affairs study released
Tuesday reports ``significantly elevated'' death rates for patients
at 44 veterans hospitals and ``likely quality of care problems'' at
22 of the medical centers.
   The study, based on a detailed analysis of selected cases, said
the quality of care problems were most pronounced at hospitals in
Tuskegee, Ala., and Battle Creek, Mich.
   In the Tuskegee center, the report said that three of 12 cases,
25 percent of those studied, were judged to have ``likely quality of
care problems.'' At Battle Creek, likely problems were found in 12
of 59 cases, or about 20 percent.
   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski ordered the report
released but said in a letter to Congress that the report ``did not
represent a particularly effective use of VA resources.''
   He said the report carries the qualifying note that ``no general
statement about the quality of care within (Veterans Affairs) can be
drawn from these findings.''
   Nonetheless, Derwinski said, ``we must try to do better.''
   He said the department must conduct a more extensive review ``so
that the American public and especially our veterans have confidence
in what we do. ... Independent oversight is essential to the
credibility of VA.''
   The report was initiated two years ago, when the hospitals were
operated by the Veterans Administration. The VA was elevated to the
Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs in March, when
Derwinski was sworn in.
   A statement by the department said that the mortality study of
veterans hospitals was initiated in 1987 after a separate federal
study was conducted of mortality rates at community hospitals
treating Medicare patients.
   Officials ``determined that a similar study within the VA system
might be a useful adjunct to new quality assurance intitiatives the
agency was undertaking,'' the statement said. ``But differences in
VA's methodology meant its results cannot be compared with ... data
on community hospitals.''
   Bill Smith, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in
Washington that the mortality figures reflect cutbacks in funds
allocated for the hospitals.
   ``The VA has had to limit care to those who are the neediest, the
sickest,'' he said. ``This may account for the higher mortality
rate.''
   The new mortality report is based on a review of 1,771 deaths in
1986 among patients at the 172 vterans hospitals around the country.
Records for the dead patients were reviewed by several levels of
evaluators and judged against a scale of predicted death based on
several factors, such as patient age, condition, nature of the
illness and type of care.
   From this study, the report concludes that 44 medical centers had
``significantly elevated mortality rates for at least one of four''
patient categories. Fifteen of the veterans' medical centers were
judged to have mortality rates lower than expected.
   Evaluators ordered 123 of the 1,771 cases to be reviewed by a
group of doctors not associated with the hospitals, a system called
peer review.
   Of the 123 cases examined in detail, two groups of peer reviewers
found 90 cases at 22 centers in which the care given was not
consistent with current medical practice.
   ``The agreement of two peer reviewers on these 90 cases makes it
appropriate to describe them as having `likely' quality of care
problems,'' the report said.
   The hospitals with higher-than-predicted death rates are in these
cities:
   Albany, N.Y.; Alexandria, La.; Asheville, N.C.; Atlanta; Battle
Creek, Mich.; Biloxi, Miss.; Birmingham, Ala.;
   Buffalo, N.Y.; Chillicothe, Ohio; Cincinnati; Columbia, S. C.;
Dayton, Ohio; Denver; Des Moines, Iowa; Durham, N.C.; Fayetteville,

   The Cuban Cabinet fired Transportation
Minister Diocles Torralbas for personal misconduct, a government
announcement said Tuesday.
   The government newspaper Granma carried the announcement and said
Torralbas repeatedly was warned to change his ways, according to
Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency. It did not specify the
nature of the alleged misbehavior.
   Gen. Senen Casas, the No. 2 man in Cuba's military hierarchy
after Defense Minister Raul Castro, is filling Torralbas' position
temporarily, the agency said. Raul is President Fidel Castro's
younger brother.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, said the Cabinet acted on
advice from the Political Bureau of the ruling Communist Party.

   Disturbed two National Endowment for the Arts
grants were used for ``morally reprehensible trash,'' Rep. Dick
Armey said Tuesday he would seek to slash NEA funding unless it
adopts guidelines that end ``this horrible abuse of tax dollars''
   The Texas Republican said he has collected the signatures of 107
House members protesting the use of tax money on projects they deem
inappropriate because of sexual or moral content.
   Armey said he met Tuesday with Hugh Southern, acting chairman of
the NEA, to discuss guidelines for grant recipients that ``clearly
pay respect to public standards of taste and decency.''
   Armey also wants the agency to consider a potential recipient's
past work when handing out grants. Also at the meeting with Southern
were Reps. Sid Yates, D-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on Interior, and John Murtha, D-Pa., a member of the
panel.
   Southern said late Tuesday that he believes the NEA can craft
``something that's agreeable to all parties that doesn't get into
any kind of chilling of expression.''
   Southern said the peer panels that review grant applications and
make recommendations to the National Council of the Arts, which
advises the NEA, ``in general do a very good job of advising us. On
very rare occasions, they may recommend something that may be
offensive to some people.''
   But the NEA ``cannot absolutely guarantee none of our grants go
to exhibits or works that do not offend anyone,'' Southern said.
   Armey said that while he welcomed Southern's promise, ``we have
had verbal assurances in the past and they've done no good.''
   The first NEA grant that prompted the protest was to artist
Andres Serrano, who received $15,000 in 1987 and created a picture
of the Crucifix which he submerged in a jar of urine.
   The second was a $30,000 award last year to support a national
tour of a 150-piece photographic retrospective called ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''
   Armey complained in his letter to Southern that the exhibit
includes ``nude photographs of children, homoerotic shots of men and
a sadomasochistic self-portrait of the artist, and other morally
repugnant materials of a sexual nature.''
   The Corcoran Gallery of Art on Monday canceled its planned
exhibit of the photographs because of concerns it would become
embroiled in a battle over federal arts funding, according to
gallery officials.
   ``The Corcoran's withdrawal from the exhibit's tour is not a
comment on the quality of the artist's work. Neither is it an
abrogation of the artist's right of free expression. Nor does it
question the Endowment's award system,'' said gallery director
Christina Orr-Cahall.
   Armey wrote in his letter, ``We realize that the interpretation
of art is a subjective evaluation, but there is a very clear and
unambiguous line that exists between what can be classified as art
and what must be called morally reprehensible trash.''
   If NEA fails to make progress in writing the new guidelines when
Congress considers next year's budget later this year, Armey said he
would consider cutting the agency's funding. If the guidelines
aren't in place by next year, he threatened even tougher cuts in the
following year's budget.
   ``The graphic evidence is there I'd win those votes,'' Armey said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on
Tuesday asked rightist political leader Robert D'Aubuisson, a man
long linked to death squads, not to embarrass the new government and
urged leftist politicians to cut ties with guerrillas, Quayle's
spokesman said.
   Quayle met separately in San Salvador with the newly inaugurated
president, Alfredo Cristiani of the Arena Party founded by
D'Aubuisson, and various political and military leaders.
   Quayle pulled D'Aubuisson aside, said press secretary David
Beckwith, and told him ``don't embarrass Cristiani.''
   ``He meant, `Don't do anything to cause problems for the
administration,''' Beckwith said, adding that D'Aubuisson nodded in
response.
   ``It's pretty obvious'' Quayle was referring to the reputed ties
of D'Aubuisson and the political party he founded and right-wing
death squads believed responsible for thousands of deaths over the
past decade.
   In light of the recent assassination of Cristiani's top cabinet
adviser, Beckwith said there are concerns that rightists might try
to retaliate.
   ``Quayle's been pretty solid that nothing of that sort should be
done,'' Beckwith told reporters traveling with Quayle as the vice
president flew from San Salvador to San Jose, Costa Rica, to
conclude a three-day swing through central America which he has
called a ``mission of peace and democracy.''
   Quayle also met with leftist leaders Guillermo Ungo and Ruben
Zamora, who are closely allied with the guerrillas, and told them
the rebels should lay down their arms.
   ``They refused,'' Beckwith said.
   The vice president congratulated them for joining the democratic
election process and urged them to cut their ties to the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, the guerrilla organization.
   According to Beckwith, the two leaders admitted that the FMLN had
been responsible for the recent assassination of El Salvador's
attorney general, Roberto Garcia Alvadora, also an Arena member, and
they suspected the FMLN was responsible for last Friday's shotgun
slaying of cabinet adviser Jose Rodriguez Porth.
   However, the two leftists declined to sever relations with the
FMLN, stating that it represents a significant proportion of
Salvadorans.
   In all his conversations, Quayle underscored the need to respect
human rights.
   Critics in Congress contend that even though Cristiani has
pledged support for human rights, he is merely a front man for
extremists who advocate use of torture, illegal detention and death
squad killings in the decade-old fight against guerrillas.
   Quayle flew to Costa Rica to end his trip by meeting with
President Oscar Arias. The two were to discuss Nicaragua and the
regional peace plan Arias authored, as well as U.S. concerns about
the continuation in office of Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega
   Earlier Tuesday, Quayle said it seems unlikely the Contras will
return to live peacefully in Nicaragua but, after meeting with their
leaders, he vowed continued U.S. support for them.
   Quayle also accused Nicaragua of trying ``to kill democracy'' in
neighboring El Salvador by arming the leftist rebel movement.
   Quayle met with Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez and three
top field commanders in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, before flying to El
Salvador on the second day of his three-day Central American trip.
   He told reporters he informed the Contras he did not know what
Congress would do in terms of renewing military aid if the
Nicaraguan elections next February are rigged.
   However, ``I said to them we continue to have and will always
have a moral obligation to the resistance,'' he added.
   ``But until I know what's going to happen between now and the
election and how that election is going to go I can't get more
specific than that,'' he said.
   The Bush administration is backing a regional diplomatic approach
to solve the Nicaraguan war and supplying non-lethal aid to the
11,000-member Contra army until the elections are concluded.
   U.S. officials have held out the possibility of renewed military
aid if Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government does not hold a
fair election.
   But Quayle and other officials acknowledge there is little
sentiment in Congress for such a move.
   Quayle also visited Rodriguez' widow and later told a news
conference: ``That type of violence was perpetrated by the FMLN and
the leftist guerrillas cannot be tolerated.''
   The Rodriguez house, in a luxurious neighborhood where
security-conscious residents live in walled compounds, was adorned
with a black ribbon and a sign reading, ``We are in mourning and we
reject terrorism.''
   Bloodstains were visible on the driveway as soldiers cordoned off
the street and dozens of U.S. Secret Service agents stood at thle also
viewed ult rifles, anti-tank rockets and other
weapons the Salvadoran military said it captured from the rebels.
   Quayle's staff released a State Department statement saying the
weaponry was of East-bloc and Cuban manufacture and blamed Havana
and Nicaragua as the principal facilitators of arms shipments to the
rebels.
   The administration accuses the Sandinistaating the
regional Esquipulas II peace accords' ban on export of revolution.
In light of that, Quayle said he is skeptical that the Sandinistas
will live up to their fair-election promise.
   Quayle said the Contra commanders he saw, whose noms de guerre
were Franklin, Vlos and Ganso, indicated they would not return
peacefully to Nicaragua because they feared for their safety.
   The vice president said he did not urge the Contras to return
home but encouraged them to ``try to use the political process that
is available to them.''
   But the commanders told him it would be ``a miracle'' tsee a
fair Nicaragua election, Quayle said.
   He said the Contras promised they were honoring the ban on
military attacks that is a condition of the $49 million in U.S. aid
Congress has allotted them until the election.

   A malpractice lawsuit accuses two doctors of
failing to tell a man he had tested positive for AIDS, and the
plaintiff's lawyer said Tuesday the lawsuit is one of the first of
its kind in the country.
   S. Michael Long, a former tire salesman who is divorced, said he
had sex with at least 14 women without using a condom before he
learned last August that he had the disease.
   ``If I knew then what I know now, I would have been abstinent,''
Long said. ``I would never dream of passing ths virus on.''
   Kenneth E. Labowitz, an Alexandria attorney who represents Long,
said there have not been very many AIDS-related malpractice cases.
   ``There are about a dozen nationwide and most of them have to do
with, oddly enough, false positives, people who have been told that
they did have AIDS when they did not,'' he said.
   Long, 39, says he requested the test for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in February 1987 while he was being treated for
kidney stones at Roanoke's Community Hospital because he had been
given blood transfusions in 1980.
   Long said Michael J. Basile, the internist who ordered the AIDS
test, told him he would contact him if it was positive and Edgar B.
Cutter, the urologist who admitted him to the hospital, knew the
test had been performed.
   Long alleges he never heard from either doctor.
   In court papers filed last month, Basile denied all allegations
of negligence but acknowledged ordering the HIV test without
providing counseling for Long.
   John Jessee, an attorney for Cutter, said his client ``denies
that he was negligent or that anything he did harmed Mr. Long in any
way.''
   Labowitz said Long learned he had contracted AIDS, apparently
from the transfusions, when he was admitted with symptoms of the
disease, including swollen glands and lethargy.
   The lawyer said Long is taking medication and his AIDS symptoms
come and go. ``He's healthier now than he has been,'' he said.
   Long contends that the doctors' failure to tell him the test
result kept him from getting treatment that could prolong his life.
   ``It's a myth that AIDS is untreatable and there's nothing you
can do,'' Labowitz said.
   Labowitz said Long has told the women and his former wife that he
has AIDS. The lawyer said the women also might have grounds for a
lawsuit.

   The National Congress on Soviet Jewry voted
Tuesday to support trade concessions to the Soviet Union if
President Bush receives assurances that positive Soviet emigration
trends will continue.
   ``The atmosphere is improving, but there is much yet to be
done,'' said Shoshana S. Cardin, the chairman of the congress.
``There are still major impediments to emigration.''
   The board of governors of the congress, which represents 47
Jewish organizations around the country, voted 48-3, with one
abstention, to endorse a 12-month waiver of Jackson-Vannik amendment
restrictions contingent on Bush receiving assurances from the
Kremlin.
   Although the language of the resolution was mild, it was
significant because the National Conference on Soviet Jewry is a
major interest group monitoring emigration from the Soviet Union.
   The Jackson-Vanik amendment, passed by Congress in 1974 under the
sponsorship of the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and Rep.
Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, now retired, requires the Kremlin to allow a
certain number of Jews to emigrate each year in return for
most-favored-nation status, under which Soviet exports are subject
to reduced tariffs in the United States.
   The legislation does not spell out levels of emigration, but
allows the president some leeway in determining what is acceptable.
Soviet leaders have bridled at the law, which they consider
interference in their domestic affairs.
   Ms. Cardin predicted at a news conference that Jewish emigration
from the Soviet Union could reach 54,000 this year, up from 18,965
last year. The previous high level was 51,320 in 1979 and the low,
since Congress passed the Jackson-Vanik amendment, was 896 in 1984.
   The resolution passed Tuesday said that ``the Soviet reform
process is in a self-described state of definition and
experimentation. The U.S.S.R. today is suspended between the
oppression of its past and the promise of the future. The extension
of new freedoms and democratic reforms coexist with old patterns of
behavior and authority.''
   It said that the organization was ``prepared to support a waiver
of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment'' if the president receives
assurances on four points: That current levels of emigration will be
maintained; that those seeking to emigrate not be blocked because
they had access to alleged `state secrets'; that the cases of
long-term refuseniks be resolved, and that Soviet authorities ease
restrictions on so-called `poor relatives.'''
   Ms. Cardin, who is from Baltimore, said that her group knew of
200 families being denied permission to emigrate because they were
``poor relatives,'' requiring signed statements from kin that they
have no outstanding financial obligations.
   She said that some 400,000 invitations have been mailed to Soviet
Jews to leave the Soviet Union, but that not all of those people had
filed for permission to emigrate. Under Soviet law, those seeking a
visa to emigrate must have permission from a relative in the country
where they are seeking to travel.
   Ms. Cardin went to Moscow in May and said she was told by Soviet
officials that they were drafting legislation that would ease
emigration, in part by not requiring the invitations to be sent by
relatives. She said there was no guarantee when the law would be
passed.

   The number of victims suffering from food poisoning
blamed on hazelnut-flavored yogurt rose to 14 and spread over a
wider geographical area, authorities said Tuesday.
   Four new confirmed cases of botulism were reported, with two of
the victims coming from North Wales. Ten previously reported cases
were confined to Lancashire in northwest England.
   Most victims were hospitalized, some in serious condition.
   Botulism is a virulent form of food poisoning, disseminated
through the bloodstream, which attacks the nerves in the head. It
causes paralysis of the eyes and throat and difficulties in
breathing and swallowing.
   Authorities were checking 10 dairies which received hazelnut
puree from a company in Folkestone, Kent, athough Health Secretary
Kenneth Clarke stressed: ``No blame is yet established on anyone.''
   Blackpool's director of public health, Tony Irving, said other
cases could emerge. He set up an incident center to monitor the
outbreak.
   The Department of Health warned people not to eat hazelnut yogurt
for the time being. Supermarkets cleared shelves of it and destroyed
stocks.
   ``At this stage, we do not know precisely what has caused this
particular outbreak associated with hazelnut products connected with
one firm in Folkestone,'' Clarke told the House of Commons.

   Former state Attorney General J. Marshall
Coleman narrowly defeated former U.S. Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr. on
Tuesday in Virginia's first Republican primary for governor in 40
years.
   Coleman will oppose Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, who is trying to
become the first elected black governor of a U.S. state. Coleman
lost in a previous bid for governor in 1981.
   With 2,006 of the state's 2,008 precincts reporting in unofficial
returns, Coleman had 147,538 votes to 139,967 for Trible, or 37
percent to 35 percent. U.S. Rep. Stanford E. Parris trailed with
112,111 votes, or 28 percent.
   A joyous Coleman appeared before his supporters at 9:40 p.m.,
saying, ``With your work and commitment, we're going to take back
the statehouse in 1990.''
   Coleman said he appreciated ``the warmth and graciousness and
eloquence of my two worthy adversaries. These two men were the
toughest adversaries a person could have.''
   Trible, who had been favored in the primary, conceded at 9:25 p.m.
   ``I've always believed in the fundamental fairness and wisdom of
the people of Virginia,'' Trible told supporters in downtown
Richmond. ``Tonight, in their wisdom, the people of Virginia have
chosen another _ Marshall Coleman.''
   The primary generated little public interest despite $10 million
in campaign spending. Voter turnout approached 400,000, much greater
than the 235,000 turnout for the GOP's Super Tuesday presidential
primary last year.
   None of the candidates played up the racial aspect of a possible
victory by Wilder, the 58-year-old Democratic lieutenant governor.
   By contrast, charges of racism marked a mayoral campaign that
culminated Tuesday in Jersey City, N.J., where City Council
President Glenn Cunningham lost a bid to become the city's first
black mayor.
   Former Mayor Gerald McCann defeated Cunningham by a margin of
30,169 to 24,249. Turnout was extremely light.
   McCann, 39, denied in the campaign that his supporters showed
white voters a 1970s photograph of Cunningham wearing his hair in an
Afro style. Cunningham, now a 43-year-old police captain, was
accused of attack advertising for trying during his campaign to
portray McCann, a wealthy accountant, as anti-tenant and
pro-developer.

<TEXT>
   In Virginia, Trible, 42, was accused of being a quitter for
leaving the Senate last year after one term rather than taking on
Democrat Charles S. Robb, a popular former governor who won a
landslide.
   Coleman, 47, was branded by his opponents as a loser for his 1981
defeat in the gubernatorial race against Robb and his inability in
1985 to win the nomination for lieutenant governor.
   Parris, 59, was attacked as a regional candidate whose interest
was limited to northern Virginia and his opposition to statehood for
Washington, D.C.
   Virginia has 2.6 million registered voters. Because registration
in the state is not by party, everyone was eligible to vote.
   Wilder, who portrays himself as a social moderate and fiscal
conservative, was nominated Saturday at the state Democratic
Convention.
   A grandson of slaves, he grew up in segregated Richmond and
attended Howard University Law School in Washington on a state
stipend because he could not go to Virginia's all-white law schools.
   The nation has not had a black governor since Reconstruction,
when Lt. Gov. Pinckney Pinchback of Louisiana became acting governor
without an election in 1872-73 after Gov. Henry Warmouth was removed
from office.

   Why do actors act, singers sing or comedians
crack jokes?
   ``Showing Off'' is the answer reiterated by four performers in
the title song of a chirpy, cheery little musical revue now playing
at a West Side cabaret room called Steve McGraw's. They call this
self-absorption ``art for artist's sake.''
   Musical revues are an endangered species in New York these days,
and good ones are near extinction. The long-running and
forever-changing ``Forbidden Broadway'' cornered the market on
spoofs of Broadway musicals. ``Showing Off,'' written by Douglas
Bernstein and Denis Markell, takes a much wider aim and more often
than not scores a bull's-eye.
   Its best songs are sly, satiric numbers with just a touch of
spite that capture the intense peculiarities of big city residents.
In one, Bernstein and Markell poke fun at SIP, Self Important
People. You know, the folks that work in theater box offices,
maitres d' at fancy French restaurants, auto mechanics, or telephone
receptionists whose first words are ``Hold, please.''
   In another, Bernstein, who appears in the show with Veanne Cox,
Donna Murphy and Mark Sawyer, plays the Showbiz Rabbi. He leads the
Temple for the Performing Arts in _ where else _ Los Angeles. At his
congregation, you can ``atone by phone'' by calling a toll-free
number.
   In ``Rental Cruelty,'' a husband and wife don't fight about co-op
or condo prices, but battle about her addiction to renting
videocassettes. ``Documentaries,'' he sobs. ``You're back on the
hard stuff.''
   Bernstein is a sleepy bear of a man with a lazy, laid-back charm.
Sawyer suggests a world-weary yuppie who lost it all in the stock
market crash. Miss Cox is a sexy Olive Oyl crossed with a Kewpie
doll, while Miss Murphy smolders with a smoky voice and a deadly
funny, deadpan manner.
   ``Showing Off'' demands a little intelligence from its audience.
It helps going into the show to know something about such diverse
subjects as Eudora Welty, ``Blue Velvet,'' ``Eraserhead'' and
Michele Marsh, an anchorwoman for the CBS affiliate in New York.
   Director Michael Leeds doesn't allow the pace to sag during the
75-minute show, moving performers on and off the small stage with
rapid-fire precision. Pianist Stephen Flaherty provides strong,
unobtrusive support, the hallmark of a fine musician.
   ``Showing Off'' proves that such musical entertainments as the
revue can be resusciated. But it takes a special kind of writing and
performance to make it consistently appealing. This lively and
literate show doesn't falter during its parade of funny business.

<HEAD>Actress Unhappy With Pending Release Of Assailant</HEAD>

   The state parole board decided Tuesday
that the deranged fan who knifed Theresa Saldana in 1982 won't be
released until March, but the actress said she can't understand why
he would ever be freed.
   Arthur Jackson, earlier given a good-behavior parole date of
Thursday that had halved his 12-year sentence for attempted murder,
must now serve an additional 270 days for breaking prison windows
and refusing to obey orders, California parole officials decided.
   His pending release had spurred moves in the state Legislature to
lengthen the sentence for second-degree murder and brought an
outraged response from Los Angeles city officials.
   New charges filed in Los Angeles last week accuse Jackson of
sending threatening letters from his prison cell, but the board
didn't rescind the good-time credits allowing Jackson an early
release.
   Jackson, a 53-year-old Scottish drifter, attacked the actress
from ``Raging Bull'' outside her West Hollywood apartment and
stabbed her 10 times with a kitchen knife.
   ``I am temporarily relieved and I'm glad we can have the baby and
not be worried about a release date around the time of my baby due
date. I will be able to have my baby in peace,'' said the actress,
who is 6 months pregnant.
   But she expressed dismay that Jackson could eventually be freed.
   ``It's very confusing. Everyone tells me, `Just have him
committed.' Everyone feels that will be the solution.''
   Jackson attorney Richard Shore of Sacramento said he may appeal
the decision, handed down after a closed disciplinary hearing by the
Board of Prison Terms at the California Medical Facility in
Vacaville.
   The prison's chief psychiatrist, V. Meenakshi, told reporters
afterward that Jackson has been diagnosed a chronic paranoid
schizophrenic who lives in his own world.
   ``If you look at it in the way the courts look at it legally,
then no, he's not dangerous in legal terms,'' she said. ``To people
he is involved with in his delusional mind, he is dangerous.''
   Jackson's new parole date is March 15, 1990. The board also added
two conditions of parole: He cannot contact the actress and cannot
return to Los Angeles County without written approval.
   Last week, Los Angeles prosecutors filed eight felony counts
against Jackson for allegedly making death threats against Miss
Saldana. Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner wanted the board
to enforce the Jackson's full 12-year sentence.
   Jackson could face eight more years in prison and possible
deportation if convicted on the latest charges.
   ``Our objective, quite simply, is to keep him off the street,''
Reiner said.

<HEAD>Museum Displays Vase Restored for Third Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Museum placed the Portland Vase in a
guarded, bulletproof display case Tuesday, a year after the
2,000-year-old Roman treasure was deliberately smashed again and
reassembled with modern glue.
   The vase, estimated to be worth $18 million, had been broken two
times before and was restored a third time because the glue holding
it together had become yellow and brittle.
   Nigel Williams, the museum's chief conservator of ceramics, said
the blue and white cameo-glass vase ``now at last is restored to its
former glory.''
   He said the latest epoxy resins were used in the restoration.
   In 1845, William Lloyd, who had been drinking heavily for a week,
smashed the vase into about 200 pieces with his walking stick when
it was displayed at the museum. Lloyd, an Irishman, had a grudge
against relatives of then Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland,
whose family had owned the vase since 1785.
   It was stuck together by the British Museum's craftsmen and put
on display. But the glue became so weak and discolored that in 1948
it was dismantled and rebuilt. Last year it was broken again and
reassembled.
   The vase was made by the sculptor Dioscourides and depicts men
and women in a leafy setting _ probably the courtship of Peleus and
the sea goddess Thetis, who became the parents of the mythical Greek
warrior Achilles.
   It was discovered in 1582 in a tomb near Rome and is believed to
have belonged to the Emperor Augustus.

<HEAD>House Votes $127 Million to Beleagured D.C. Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, responding to a drug-driven record
murder rate in the nation's capital, voted Tuesday to spend $127
million to hire 700 additional District of Columbia police officers.
   The bill, which passed by a 289-104 margin, authorizes spending
the money over five years to bring extra force to a police
department that now has slightly more than 3,900 members.
   ``This bill will bring peace and stability to neighborhoods that
have erupted in an outbreak of drug-related violence,'' said Del.
Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., chief sponsor the measure.
   The measure is awaiting action in the Senate. Congress would
still have to appropriate the money each year to allow it to be
spent.
   Through Tuesday, 202 people had been killed in the district so
far in 1989, compared to 133 at the same time last year. A record
372 persons were killed in Washington in 1988, and police blamed
more than 60 percent of these killings on drugs.
   Although opponents said the bill would be a costly special
special stipend for one city, backers won with arguments that
Congress has ultimate responsibility for safety in the nation's
capital.
   ``I find it almost uncanny that members can on the one hand begin
to be seriously concerned about the health and safety of residents
of the District of Columbia, but when we begin to address that
issue, the issue suddenly becomes numbers,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., chairman of the District of Columbia Committee.
   The bill also directs the city to begin construction on a new
800-bed prison and drug treatment facility in southeast Washington,
and establish a community relations plan by assigning the officers
to regular neighborhood beats.
   The measure also stipulates that all assets seized in drug raids
be turned over to the police department for use in anti-drug
programs.
   Mayor Marion Barry, whose contacts with a convicted drug dealer
are the subject of a federal grand jury probe and criticism on
Capitol Hill, said the House action demonstrates that the city still
has a good rapport with Congress.
   ``We are very pleased with the outcome,'' Barry said. ``It shows
that our relationship with the Hill is still intact.''
   Congress is also considering a proposal to assign officers from
federal police agencies to the city police department while the 700
additional officers are recruited and trained.

   A 10-year-old Armenian boy flew home Tuesday,
waving goodbye with the hand that was crushed in last December's
devastating earthquake and painstakingly reconstructed by surgeons
here.
   Karen Kocharian, accompanied by his 34-year-old father Sarkis and
bearing numerous gifts, was taller and heavier than when he arrived
Feb. 7.
   But the biggest change was to his right hand, which doctors at
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia repaired with two toes
transplanted from his left foot.
   Another boy from the Soviet republic, 14-year-old Hartyoun
Sarkissian, and his father left on the same flight from Philadelphia
International Airport.
   Sarkissian, who like Karen is from Leninakan, was fitted for a
prosthesis at Shriner Hospital for Crippled Children to replace his
left arm, and underwent surgery on his left leg.
   The two were among 37 Armenians brought to the United States for
treatment by Project Hope, a non-profit medical aid group, after the
quake that killed an estimated 25,000 people and injured thousands
more.
   ``I'm going to miss him,'' said Karen's occupational therapist,
Dore DiBerardino, ``but he's promised to write to me as part of his
homework.''
   One of the youngster's surgeons, Dr. Lee Osterman, plans to
travel to Armenia next year to separate Karen's two fingers, which
are enclosed in a ball of flesh.
   A third Armenian, Anik Meloyan, came to the airport to see the
Kocharians and Sarkissians off.
   ``She wishes she were going also,'' said Meloyan's host, Vicki
Nazaria.
   The 14-year-old girl, who received treatment for a fractured,
infected leg, is scheduled to leave later this month.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar was
indicted Tuesday on charges that he illegally aided felons, making
him the first federal judge charged with violating U.S. racketeering
laws.
   Also indicted by the federal grand jury were Abe ``The Trigger''
Chapman, a self-styled former Mafia hitman and longtime acquaintance
of Aguilar's, and Rudy Tham, a convicted embezzler for whom Aguilar
allegedly interceded.
   If convicted of all charges in the eight-count indictment,
Aguilar, 58, could be sentenced to 55 years in prison and fined $2
million.
   The indictment obtained by the Justice Department accuses Aguilar
of going to other federal judges and trying to get favorable
treatment for Tham and another felon, Ronald Cloud, a Nevada casino
owner who was convicted of bank fraud. Aguilar has disclosed in
financial statements that he accepted an interest-free, lifetime
$12,000 loan from Cloud.
   The judge is also accused of tipping off Chapman about a federal
wiretap order; advising one of Chapman's lawyers to lie to the grand
jury about Aguilar's activities; making false statements to the FBI;
and helping his former secretary, attorney Vera Hoff, while she was
a fugitive in Mexico, where she fled after a tax conviction.
   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy Carter, is the first
federal judge charged with racketeering and the fourth to be accused
of crimes in the last decade.
   Unlike most cases brought under the federal racketeering law,
Aguilar is not accused of benefiting financially from his
activities. Instead, the indictment contends the judge used his
$89,500-a-year job as a racketeering ``enterprise'' in multiple acts
of ``corruptly endeavoring to obstruct, impede, and influence the
due administration of justice.''
   Aguilar declined to talk to reporters who went to his home in
Campbell near San Jose after the indictment, and attempts by The
Associated Press to obtain his telephone number were unsuccessful.
   Talking to reporters before the long-expected indictment, Patrick
Hallinan, a lawyer for Aguilar, called the accusations ``hogwash''
and contended the judge was being targeted as a minority liberal who
has issued several important rulings against the government.
   Federal prosecutors sought the indictment because ``they don't
like the viewpoint of one judge,'' Hallinan said.
   The indictment was issued after Mrs. Hoff, who was arrested in
March, agreed to testify against Aguilar in a plea bargain with the
government.
   Aguilar's former secretary broke down in tears while testifying
Tuesday afternoon, said her attorney, Randy Sue Pollack.
   Mrs. Hoff was promised no additional time for absconding, and a
parole hearing in September regarding her two-year prison sentence,
her lawyer said.
   Violations of a federal law called the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, are punishable by up to 20 years
in prison.
   Hallinan said Aguilar has arranged to turn himself in on July 12
or 13. He said he has asked the judge to take a leave from his job
in the San Jose federal court while the charges are pending, though
not to resign from office; a federal judge can be removed only
through impeachment by Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada became the first
judge this century to be impeached in 1986, two years after he was
convicted of income tax evasion.
   Impeachment is pending against two other federal judges, Alcee
Hastings of Florida, over allegations stemming from his acquittal on
bribery charges, and Walter Nixon of Mississippi, who was convicted
of perjury.
   The RICO law, passed in 1970, prohibits conducting an
``enterprise'' in a pattern of criminal activity, consisting of at
least two specified crimes in a 10-year period. The crimes range
from murder and kidnapping to mail fraud, obstruction of justice and
interference with criminal investigations.
   The law was aimed at fighting organized crime but has been
interpreted broadly to apply to a variety of ongoing criminal
activity, including the misuse of a government position such as
police officer or state judge for personal benefit.

   The Senate Finance Committee approved
ground-breaking legislation Tuesday that would give a new tax credit
of up to $500 a year to low-income working Americans to help them
buy health insurance for their children.
   The provision was part of a larger measure crafted by committee
chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, that also would enable the working
poor to take fuller advantage of tax credits for child care already
available to everyone.
   Democratic leaders are contemplating having the measure debated
this week on the Senate floor. It is certain to produce sparks not
only because of the innovative new health tax credit, but also
because it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits than
another major Democratic initiative, yet differs significantly from
yet another child care program proposed by President Bush.
   The 17-3 vote by which the measure cleared committee was not a
true measure of its overall support even among committee members.
Several Republicans who voted for it said they had serious
reservations and were acting largely to spur consideration of child
care legislation.
   ``I know there is going to be a big battle with the ABC bill on
the floor,'' said Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., a committee member and
the Senate GOP leader. ``Maybe we'll end up without any child care
bill at all.''
   Dole's reference to the ``ABC'' bill was to a measure by Sen.
Chris Dodd, D-Conn., that envisions a much more expensive child care
program and one that generates additional controversy because it
would impose national standards on day-care providers.
   The Bentsen legislation aims at providing about $10.5 billion in
additional benefits over a five-year period without increasing the
federal budget deficit. It would raise the money by keeping the
existing 3 percent telephone excise tax in place indefinitely rather
than allowing it to expire after Dec. 31, 1990 under current law.
   The measure also would delay for one year the imposition of
so-called Section 89 of the tax code governing tax deductions for
employer-paid health insurance and simplify the rules once they do
take effect.
   Although having little direct impact on individuals, the Section
89 provisions have generated a huge outcry from businesses
complaining largely about the complexity of compliance.
   The rules are intended to discourage richer health insurance
policies for executives than for rank-and-file workers by
prohibiting bigger tax breaks for such executive plans.
   The new rules would simply record-keeping procedures and clarify
eligibility tests for what would constitute impermissibly subsidized
policies.
   Although some members expressed skepticism that the health
insurance tax credit would help much, Bentsen said he was encouraged
by testimony before the Finance Committee on Monday by a Blue Cross
vice president who predicted the insurance industry would develop
policies aimed directly at children if a new federal subsidy is made
available to help pay for them.
   He said such policies are already available in California for
about $250 a year per child.
   The new tax credit would be up to 50 percent of the cost of a
policy up to $1,000, resulting in a maximum of $500 for a family
with $12,000 or less income. The percentage decreases steadily until
the credit would not be available for a family with more than
$21,000 income.
   The policy would have to cover at least one dependent child under
age 19, but also could cover other family members, including adults.
   ``Here we're trying to get at the working poor,'' Bentsen said.
   The health tax credit would be ``refundable.'' That is, a family
that qualifies for the tax credit, but does not make enough money to
have to pay income tax, would get the benefit in the form of a cash
grant.
   Bentsen's package also makes an existing tax credit refundable so
poorer Americans would be able to claim the same benefit even if
they do not incur an income tax liability.
   The current credit is up to 30 percent for child care costs up to
$4,800 for a household with two or more eligible children or $2,400
for one child.
   The 30 percent credit is available only to households with income
below $10,000 and falls by 1 percentage point for each $2,000 of
adjusted gross income between $10,000 and $28,000. Above $28,000,
the maximum credit is 20 percent.
   In addition to making the credit refundable, the Bentsen bill
would increase the credit to 32 percent for taxpayers with income
between $8,000 and $10,000 a year and to 34 percent for those making
below $8,000 a year.
   In other words, a single mother working for the minimum wage and
paying $40 a week for a babysitter would be eligible for a $980 tax
credit _ in cash if necessary _ rather than the $624 deduction from
taxes due under current law.

   The wife of House ethics committee chairman
Julian Dixon earned over $150,000 in two years from an investment of
less than $15,000 in companies that help run stores at Los Angeles
International Airport.
   Airport officials are looking into the two companies to determine
whether they qualified properly as minority contractors. Although
they had identical boards of directors, one was listed as a minority
enterprise while another was listed as being run by women.
   On Monday, Dixon amended his 1986 financial disclosure form to
show that his wife, Betty, paid between $5,000 and $15,000 for the
investment in the companies.
   Dixon, D-Calif., initially told The Associated Press he did not
have to reveal how much Mrs. Dixon paid for the high-yield
investment because she owned no stock in the California companies,
Mir Kanon Inc. and Peideau Inc.

   Twin earthquakes that shook Los Angeles did
little harm, but they scared people and highlighted the danger from
recently discovered faults concealed deep beneath the nation's
second-largest city.
   The temblors, however, suggest the danger may be more likely to
come from a series of moderate quakes than from a much-feared ``big
one.''
   ``Nothing that happened today makes us fear a larger earthquake
any more than we did before,'' said U.S. Geological Survey
seismologist Lucile Jones. ``What happened today should make you
feel a little more relieved.''
   The Monday morning quakes injured one person and caused scattered
minor damage downtown and in suburbs to the east, including cracked
plaster, fallen ceiling tiles and broken windows.

stump at the National Zoo into a mirror of the exotic life around
him.
   Using chainsaw, drill, mallets and chisels from his scaffolding,
Weitzman is sculpting a tribute to zoo volunteers from the barren
trunk of a nearly century-old willow oak that was chopped down last
year because it was dying. He found the stump lying abandoned near a
creek in the zoo.
   Weitzman, 36, a native of Boulder, Colo., who came to Washington
by way of Los Angeles, has been working since last August to convert
the trunk into a work of art honoring those who ``maintain our
extended family _ the flora and fauna of the planet.''
   He already has inhabited the upper reaches of the stump with a

eagle, a scowling orangutan, a contented panda, great blue heron,
water lizard, tree shrew, fish, squirrel and a giraffe nibbling
greenery offered by the outstretched hand of a young man.

   Despite its unilateral cuts, the Soviet military's
``overwhelming numbers'' still make it the world's biggest war
machine and don't back up Kremlin claims about a switch to defensive
strategy, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Tuesday.
   ``Speaking candidly, it is rather difficult for Americans _ and
those in many other countries _ to see how such a massive array of
power is mandated by the legitimate needs of defense,'' Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr. told students and instructors at the Voroshilov General
Staff Military Academy in Moscow.
   Crowe, on an 11-day official visit to the Soviet Union, also
suggested that instead of announcing more unilateral reductions, the
Kremlin join the United States in negotiating mutual cuts, even of
modest scale _ a step he said would best promote progress in arms
control.
   ``You'd be surprised at the effect it would have, and pave the
way for more dramatic steps in the future,'' Crowe told his Soviet
audience.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev

Tuesday to ``heal the wounds'' of European division, which they
helped inflict half a century ago.
   They assured the world their partnership poses no threat this
time, as it did when Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin divided Poland in
their 1939 non-aggression pact.
   Both nations want ``a common European home in which the United
States and Canada have their place'' and all nations exist in
``peaceful competition with one another,'' the joint declaration
says.
   A tidal wave of goodwill toward Gorbachev on the second day of
his state visit appeared to wash away fears rooted in the collusion
of the dictators and the destruction of World War II.

   That Bob Elliott always seemed like such a nice
man.
   Remember the halcyon days of the Elliott clan, when all three
networks would set up in the two-acre yard behind ``the Hut,'' the
family's fabulous Upper East Side mansion _ better known nowadays as
the Metropolitan Museum of Art _ to cover those fairytale birthday
parties that famous comedian Bob Elliott (one half of Bob and Ray)
would throw for his youngest son, Chris, who grew up to be
semifamous as a regular on ``Late Night With David Letterman''?
   Did any of us realize that those were all Bob Elliott's friends?
Did any of us really think a 6-year-old would invite Dick Cavett to
his birthday party? Or Jerry Vale? Or Andy Rooney and Charles Kuralt
_ who wrestled shirtless, for Pete's sake?
   Well, it seems that after long years of painful self-examination,
Chris Elliott has finally found the courage to write the book that
explodes the myth _ ``Daddy's Boy.'' It makes ``Mommie Dearest'' _
and Jackie Rogers Jr.'s ``Damn You, Daddy Dearest'' _ look like love
letters!
   What a shock to find out that Bob Elliott was so egomaniacal, he
named his sons Bob Jr., 1 through 9 _ except the twins, who were 5A
and 5B. Chris, the 10th son, was even forced to wear a latex
``bald'' wig so he would look more like his father. ``Otto
Preminger,'' Chris' heartless classmates called him.
   ``How could I make people listen to me?'' Chris writes
searchingly in his opening chapter. ``How could I tell the story
that so desperately needed telling, and maybe make a few bucks in
the process, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Write a book!
...
   ``But wait a second, was I nuts? Did I really have enough
complaints about growing up to fill a book? I convinced myself that
that didn't matter. The only important thing was that I get my face
on the cover.''
   What also mattered was the legal action Bob Elliott was sure to
take when Chris let him have it in the tell-all book. To assuage the
legal eagles, Chris gamely offered his father a rebuttal to each
chapter.
   ``I don't know what Chris is talking about,'' Bob complains in
his rebuttal to Chapter 1 of ``Daddy's Boy'' (Delacorte Press,
$12.95). ``Chris doesn't have nine brothers. He has three sisters
and one brother. We did not live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
and I have never in my life had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jerry
Vale, although I would not turn down such an opportunity if it
presented itself. Do my lawyers actually think people are going to
take this book seriously?''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS ON TELEVISION _ Media Monitor, a research
publication of the Center for Media Studies in Washington, says CBS
was tougher on President George Bush during his first 100 days in
office than NBC or ABC.
   A study by the non-profit media research group found Bush
received favorable personal evaluations, but his policies were
assessed positively only 39 percent of the time on CBS, compared to
63 percent favorable on NBC. ABC gave Bush 85 percent positive
evaluations, according to the analysis.
   Whether negative or positive, Bush is getting less coverage than
his predecessors, according to the study. He has drawn 37 percent
fewer stories than Ronald Reagan did in 1981 and 45 percent fewer
than Jimmy Carter in 1977.
   MORE TALES FROM SOME CRYPT _ CBS is reprising that fabulous ``CBS
Summer Playhouse,'' so viewers can see all the stuff that wasn't
even good enough to be one of the network's bad shows. The busted
pilots season begins June 20. ... ``Tour of Duty'' gets a head start
on fall by moving to its new time period on Saturday as of June 17.

<HEAD>``P-Star'' May Shed New Light on Economy</HEAD>

   Bored by humdrum economic statistics like the
unemployment rate, housing starts and quarterly estimates of the
seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of the real gross national
product?
   Well, the Federal Reserve has something new to spice up your
study of economics _ the mysterious forces that help determine the
size of your paycheck and make everything you want to buy too
expensive.
   It's called P-star, after the symbol _ P with an asterisk _ used
in the mathematical equations by which it is computed.
   The P stands for the level of prices everybody pays for goods and
services. The asterisk means, roughly, ``not the current level of
prices, but the natural-long term level where they would stand
depending on the amount of money flowing through the economy.''
   In other words, it is an experimental tool for measuring and
managing future inflationary trends.
   That makes it potentially important because the Fed bases its
decisions about whether to stimulate the economy by lowering
interest rates, or to slow it down by making credit more expensive,
largely on where it believes the inflation rate is headed.
   Traders in the financial markets also help to set interest rates
by buying or selling bonds based on their inflation expectations and
on what they believe the Fed will do next.
   So if the Fed deems P-star significant and useful, Fed-watchers
will watch it too, and it someday could make a difference in whether
you can afford a mortgage or how much interest you can get on a
certificate of deposit.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, described P-star several
months ago in testimony before a congressional committee.
   He said research by the central bank's staff ``indicates that
future changes in the rate of inflation have been fairly reliably
linked to the difference between the prevailing price level (P
without a star) and its equilibrium level (P-star).''
   When actual prices stand below P-star, the Fed's studies suggest,
inflation seems likely to increase at some point in the future.
   When actual prices are above P-star, conversely, a slowing of
inflation can be expected somewhere down the road.
   Calculated for recent three-month periods, actual prices have
been below P-star, suggesting increasing inflationary pressures. But
the gap has been narrowing, and there is talk that the figures may
soon point to lower, rather than higher, inflation in the future.
   However, private economists warn against putting too much weight
on this nascent number.
   ``First, this is a long-run indicator and is not meant to be used
for short-run adjustments to monetary policy,'' said Darwin Beck at
the investment firm First Boston Corp.
   ``Second, there is a long lag between when P-star points to a
deceleration of inflation and when that deceleration begins to show
up in actual price changes. In most cases this lag is a year or more.
   ``Short-run monetary policy will not be influenced by this
indicator.''
   Skeptics say the idea of P-star itself is questionable because
the formula used to calculate it requires making some dubious
assumptions _ giving stable values to some aspects of the economy
that are inherently unstable and unpredictable.
   ``It's certainly too early to tell just what if any role this new
analysis will have in the policy process,'' said David Resler, chief
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
   ``If it is given prominence, Fed policymakers could find
themselves exposed to criticism about the underlying assumptions
that determine P-star.''

<HEAD>Morris Udall: Ravaged by Disease, but Still Tough</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Goldwater's name in 2nd graf: Note 3rd
graf mentions that Udall's birthday is June 15.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the House Interior Committee hearing room
hangs a portrait of Chairman Morris Udall, standing tall with his
coat slung over his shoulder. The longtime lawmaker, former
presidential candidate and well-known humorist appears eager for a
challenge.
   But the man occupying the chairman's seat across the room no
longer mirrors his portrait. He sits stooped in his chair, his hands
quivering and his voice barely audible.
   Although physically ravaged by Parkinson's disease, Udall, 67
years old today, fends off calls for his retirement and still gets
his message through clearly.
   ``My replacement hasn't been born yet,'' Udall recently told Rep.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., who had the temerity to ask his
fellow Democrat whether he'd been grooming anyone to take over the
House seat from Arizona he's held since 1960.
   ``He's as tough as in the portrait,'' says Rep. John Rhodes,
R-Ariz., whose district neighbors Udall's.
   ``His mind is still very sharp,'' said Rep. Don Young, of Alaska,
the committee's ranking Republican. ``We've been fighting for 14 or
15 years. I've beat him two or three times, but it's very
difficult.''
   Udall, who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a
glass eye and unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential
nomination in 1976, has taken the disease as a challenge and, his
staff says, is fighting it with a sense of humor.
   There's never been any doubt about that sense of humor.
   One of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by Udall back when
news was circulating about Paula Parkinson, a shapely lobbyist whose
kiss-and-tell habit had many members of Congress nervous.
   ``There are two kinds of Parkinson's disease,'' said Udall.
``Both of them give you the shakes.''
   Although Udall, a liberal, says he doesn't use an iron hand to
rule the committee, which oversees government lands, it's easy to
see that legislation he opposes doesn't stand a chance.
   Republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in May
when their amendments to the Udall-sponsored American Heritage Trust
Act were defeated by Democratic proxies held by Udall.
   ``My style is different,'' he said in a recent interview. He uses
``the merits'' to argue his position, he said dryly. Pausing, he
said, ``I jest.''
   Then, with the sagacity for which he is known, Udall defined
power in Washington as ``the ability for me to have you vote `aye'
when you want to vote `no.'''
   ``It may be because of a favor from the past, because you like me
or because I gave time to the opposition,'' he said.
   Udall was hospitalized last month to have his Parkinson's
medication adjusted and for treatment of pneumonia. An old friend,
Ben Cole, wrote a column for The Arizona Republic suggesting that
Udall retire.
   ``It hurt him,'' said Cole, former Washington bureau chief for
the Republic, retired and living in suburban Virginia. ``I'm sorry
for that.''
   But Cole said he sticks by his column. ``You can't ask people to
stay young forever,'' he said, adding that he fears people will
start taking advantage of Udall because of his health.
   Committee colleagues from both parties support Udall's decision
to stay.
   ``We owe him,'' said Young. ``Even though we are adversaries on
many issues (and) our philosophies are different, ... I respect him
very much.''
   Another frequent adversary on the committee, Rep. Ron Marlenee,
R-Mont., said he would ``support Mr. Udall for as long as he chooses
to come to Congress. I have the greatest respect for him.''
   Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, mentioned by Cole as someone
who knew when it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders,
wrote Udall after the column was published.
   ``Your fellow Arizonans are sitting out here, reading that
everybody in the Land of Oz is urging you to step down and come
home,'' the Republican said.
   ``I hope to God you do what you want to do, to hell with these
advisors that want you to come back. I'd love to have you in
Arizona, with me, (but) to be honest with you, I'd rather have you
in Washington doing the things you do for our state.''
   When he was released from the hospital May 26, Udall's doctors
told him to rest for a week or two. Five days later, he was back in
his office.
   ``He keeps very active, which is very important,'' said Frank
Williams, executive director of the American Parkinson Disease
Association, of which Udall is honorary chairman.
   Williams acknowledged that at times Udall looks bad, but said
Parkinson's patients have intact mental abilities.
   ``They do not lose their faculties,'' he said. ``They watch their
body deteriorate day after day.''
   Williams said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the
disease. Udall has battled it for about 10. He also suffers from
arthritis, said an aide, which accounts for his stoop.
   Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that affects automatic
movements, forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions
normal people have without thinking.
   Another symptom is loss of voice, said Williams.
   Despite that handicap, Udall speaks to other Parkinson's patients
at functions arranged by the association. ``He's an inspiration
because he hasn't given up,'' said Williams.
   Many don't want him to. Most bluntly, Goldwater gave Udall this
advice on detractors:
   ``Tell them to go to hell.''

   A handsome, obsessed young man in ascot and
smoking jacket pensively paces the vast rooms of his ancestral
manor, as clouds scud across the moon on a brooding night.
   He muses: ``Criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot, so my
disguise must be able to strike terror in their hearts! ... Must be
a creature of the night, black, terrible ...''
   CRASH! The windows open, and a huge bat flies into the room. An
omen! ``That's it,'' he exults. ``I shall become a bat!!!''
   A half-century ago, Bruce Wayne donned gray tights, blue-black
cape and bat-eared cowl to go forth in the dark of night in Gotham
City to fight crime as Batman.
   Today, as a $40 million movie, he ranks with such great fictional
detectives as Sherlock Holmes and the Lone Ranger.
   He began 50 years ago in New York City. ``Superman'' had been
around for a year. Eighteen-year-old Bob Kane was asked by DC Comics
editor Vincent Sullivan to devise a new character to meet the demand
for more superheroes.
   ``I remember,'' Kane said in an interview, ``when I was 12 or 13
I was an ardent reader of books on how things began _ the
automobile, the steam engine, the parachute _ and I came across a
book about Leonardo da Vinci. This had a picture of a flying machine
with huge bat wings. ... It looked like a bat man to me.''
   He also remembered the 1920 movie ``The Mark of Zorro,'' starring
Douglas Fairbanks Sr. ``During the day he was a bored count, a
philanthropist,'' Kane said. ``But he became Zorro at night. He
donned this mask and came out of a cave riding a black horse.''
   And there was a somber 1930 movie, ``The Bat Whispers,'' starring
Chester Morris as a costumed villain who wore a full-face bat mask.
Kane also was inspired by radio and pulp novel heroes such as
``wealthy man-about-town LaMont Cranston'' who by night became The
Shadow, a grim avenger, and news publisher Britt Reid, who became
the crime-fighting Green Hornet.
   ``I know it sounds like I'm copying, but everyone saw what I
saw,'' Kane said. ``I was reinterpreting. It was my vision, my
interpretation.''
   So within a weekend, the Batman was born.

   It is night in Gotham, a city of looming shadows, expressionist
architecture, gutters and grinning gargoyles. Six-year-old Bruce
Wayne is walking home from the movies (``The Mark of Zorro,'' some
say) with his parents, Martha and Dr. Thomas Wayne.
   A robber steps from the shadows, an automatic in his hand. A
struggle! He shoots Dr. and Mrs. Wayne to death as the little boy
watches. The gunman flees. The little boy sobs over the bodies of
his parents.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The minute that Thomas and Martha Wayne died, Bruce Wayne
stopped living,'' said Denny O'Neill, the Batman writer-editor at DC
Comics. ``Maybe he didn't know he was Batman, but he became the
remorseless avenger.''
   The boy grows up. He studies ``scientific crime detection,''
acrobatics and martial arts. He makes himself a supreme instrument
of justice: a fighter, a forensic scientist, an escape artist who
rivals Houdini, a master of disguise.
   ``The things he's about are obsession and human perfectablity,
which makes him unique among the pantheon of superheroes,'' O'Neill
said. ``It's about urban fears. It's about what's happened to cities
in the last 100 years.''
   Gotham City, O'Neill explained, is an important character in the
Batman saga. ``Gotham City is this dramatic, brooding,
claustrophobic place where anytime you turn the corner, something
bad can happen,'' he said.
   Robin, the Boy Wonder, joined Batman in April 1940. His name was
derived from Robin Hood, another righter of wrongs, and so were his
red tunic and green boots.
   ``You can argue that he was an essential element of Batman's
popularity because he counters all the grimness,'' O'Neill said.
``It's also very useful for the grim avenger to have somebody to
talk to, so we can have what we writers call exposition.''
   Robin was Dick Grayson, the son of circus trapeze artists who saw
his parents fall to their deaths, slain by mobsters. Wayne took the
young aerialist as his ward, and soon the wise-cracking young
punster was a constant companion on the Caped Crusader's midnight
patrols.
   ``Robin was for the kid reader to identify with, which kind of
puzzled me,'' said the artist-writer Jules Feiffer. ``The role of
the kid was to be adventurous; the role of the grownup was to save
him.''
   The '40s were a great time for the Dynamic Duo. When World War II
struck, Batman and Robin fought at home against spies, fifth
columnists, racketeers, profiteers, ration book counterfeiters.
   They also conquered such enduring psychopaths as The Penguin,
Two-Face and The Joker. The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson in the
movie, is a grinning, green-haired, white-faced, leering ``Clown
Prince of Crime'' whose features were altered permanently by an
unfortunate chemical bath. He is utterly crazy.
   By the early '50s, some comic books were seriously nasty. Their
stories of crime, horror and war curdled with violence, gore and
bosomy babes in naughty clothes, serious bondage and bad
relationships.
   Sen. Estes Keefauver's 1955-56 subcommittee on juvenile
delinquency and other anti-comics forces made the industry purge the
sex and violence. Batman became a model citizen and role model.
   ``He became a kind of bright, sunny scoutmaster who would walk
down the street and the people would say, `Hi, Batman!''' O'Neill
said. ``He wasn't the kind of guy who would scare me.''
   Batman and Robin traveled in time, went to other planets and
fought crooks in huge amusement parks, futuristic playgrounds and
vast arenas filled with oversized consumer goods. And Batman's
inventions _ the Batmobile, Batplane, Batcopter, the multipurpose
Batarang and ever-useful Utility Belt _ overwhelmed the scary aspect
of Batman's character.
   His forensic abilities (``Great Scott! There's only one place
where you can find jute threads in Gotham City!'') were as sharp as
ever, but the fearsome underside of the Batman's obsession was gone.
   Batman mutated into a beefy, genial, lantern-jawed crook-thumper
who chuckled at Robin's awful pun in the last panel.

<TEXT>NEW YORK: last panel.    In the '60s, Pop Art popped and Batman
became camp. In 1966, Batman got a television series that starred the feckless
Adam West as the Caped Crusader and Burt Ward as Robin. The Dark Knight
Detective went burlesque, a thick-headed straight man to made-for-TV villains
whose schemes were thwarted in hilarious stunt-man combats interspered
with ``THUD!'' ``POW!'' and ``SPLAT'' captions.    By the early '70s,
popular culture had left Batman behind. Places such as Vietnam, Kent State,
Woodstock and Altamont had made Gotham City irrelevant. O'Neill returned
the gothic element to the stories and Batman to the night. Artist Neal
Adams drew a lithe, muscular Batman with a cinematic realism that sizzled
with pent-up energy.    The evils Batman found were born out of social
ills such as drug addiction, terrorism, racism, poverty _ and sometimes
victory was impossible.    The '80s saw Robin part company with Batman.
He changed costume to become Nightwing and hang out with the young super-heroes
known as The Teen Titans.    Batman went his own way and adopted another
Robin, a headstrong, unruly street kid named Jason Todd. The new Robin
was ill-received by Batman's readers, who insisted by majority vote on
a 900-number telephone poll that the new, unpopular Boy Wonder meet an
untimely end. He did, blown up by the Joker.    In 1986, the legend received
a startling new vision with the so-called graphic novel: ``The Dark Knight
Returns,'' by Frank Miller, a shy artist who won't give interviews.  
 His Batman is 46 or so, retired from crime-fighting and much too old to
be leaping around the crazed skyline of a Gotham that has sunk back into
the ooze of corruption, greed and savage, random violence.    Bruce Wayne
is bored, depressed, drinking too much and still tormented by his parents'
deaths and the vision of the bat. He emerges from retirement and embarks
on a bloody war against evil.    Gotham City is still a character. So
is The Joker. And so is Robin _ this time a 13-year-old girl named Carrie.
   ``The Dark Knight Returns'' is as violent and nasty as the bad old
comics of yesteryear, but packaged as a trade paperback for adult readers.
   Feiffer calls Miller's artistic vision ``graphically exciting but unpersuasive
as fiction.'' Kane, who thinks Miller is a talented artist, doesn't like
the notion that Bruce Wayne has a drinking problem in the book.    However,
he does credit Miller with helping to renew the Batman saga and making
the movie possible. Kane was a consultant for the film, and his autobiography,
``Batman and Me,'' is due out in October.    ``He adapts to each era,''
Kane said. ``He fights against all injustices in the world. He fights the
battle for the little man. ... He rights the wrongs that they cannot. 
  ``He's their hero. He's everybody.''

<TEXT>
   Return with us now to May 1939 and the Batman's
debut in Detective Comics No. 27.
   Our story opens as handsome, young socialite Bruce Wayne chats
with his old friend, Police Commissioner Gordon.
   Wayne, his smartly tailored suit a lively orange window-pane
plaid, asks if anything exciting is happening these days.
   ``No,'' Gordon replies. ``Except this fellow they call the
`Bat-Man' puzzles me!'' Indeed!
   It seems a grim, costumed ``Bat-Man'' has taken up crime
fighting. Always one step ahead of the police, he tosses thugs about
like throw pillows.
   A bizarre series of burglary-murders ensues. The Batman
investigates. Conflict! A struggle. The Caped Crusader is subdued!
... Trapped!
   Villain sneers: ``This is the gas chamber I use to kill guinea
pigs. To experiment with _ but now YOU are my guinea pig (Heh! Heh!)
When this glass lid covers you entirely, gas will come through the
jet and kill you (Heh! Heh!)''
   Victim comeback: ``You fiend.''
   ``Bat-Man'' comment after slugging criminal mastermind to
horrible plunging death in acid vat: ``A fitting end for his kind.''
   Wayne casually reappears for the denouement, and Gordon reflects,
``Bruce Wayne is a nice young chap _ but he certainly must lead a
boring life. ... Seems disinterested in everything.''
   Ha! The story ends as Wayne ``returns home to his room ... a
little later his door slowly opens ... and reveals its occupant. ...
If the commissioner could see his young friend now ... he'd be
amazed to learn that he is the `Bat-Man!'''
   ``Watch for a new thrilling Bat-Man story next month.''

   So maybe there's not a Batman disposable
diaper.
   Yet.
   But you can snag a Batman walkie-talkie, Batman trading cards,
Batman pajamas and Batman underwear, a Batman lunch box _ with a
Batman thermos _ and just about every strain of Batman kitsch
imaginable.
   ``There's as much merchandise tied to this movie as any movie
I've ever seen since `Star Wars,''' said Gary Caplan, president of
the marketing consulting firm Gary Caplan Inc.
   ``Batman is the hottest thing in T-shirts right now,'' said Marek
Kiyashka, whose company, Changes, handles orders for Batman-themed
shirts. ``It's been hot since early April and will probably be hot
until October.''
   The Batman bug has bitten scores of fans. ``Stores that normally
would not carry or rarely carry any movie merchandise _ Macy's, for
example _ are carrying Batman merchandise,'' said Brad Nye,
publisher of Biz! The Show Business Catalogue.
   But what if ``Batman'' the movie doesn't meet the feverish
expectations, and the movie fizzles? Will retailers be left with a
surplus of Batman pencil erasers, refrigerator magnets and handcuffs?
   Although movie audiences have eagerly greeted the ``Batman''
preview trailer, the Warner Bros. film is still an unknown quantity.
Few people in Hollywood have seen it. What's more, the Batman
character has limited audience appeal, according to a 1988 marketing
study.
   In the test by Marketing Evaluation Inc., Batman was less popular
than Deputy Dawg, Moon Mullins, Chicken Little, the Incredible Hulk
and Beany and Cecil. The California Raisins, in fact, proved four
times more appealing than the Caped Crusader.
   ``On the strength of the character's appeal, `Batman' as a movie
will have a hard time finding an audience,'' said Steven Levitt,
president of Marketing Evaluation.
   ``Our projection ... is that `Batman' as a movie will flop. But
that does not say that if you add up all the nickels and dimes of
T-shirts and lunch boxes and memo pads and balloons and every other
license category under the sun, that you can't aggregate all of that
into $1 billion of license merchandise.''
   Since the Batman license holders, DC Comics and Warner Bros.,
receive from 6 percent to 10 percent of the wholesale price of
Batman items, sales from merchandise could generate a windfall.
Furthermore, store displays of the more than 100 different Batman
products may encourage reluctant moviegoers to take a chance on the
film.
   Still, while not everyone is pessimistic about the movie's
chances, others are concerned that the span of Batman goods may be
too wide.
   ``In the gift business, I think there's an extraordinary
opportunity here,'' said Bob Solomon, president of Applause Inc.,
makers of Batman plastic figurines, pencil toppers, stationery,
dolls, coffee mugs and a Batman ``suction-cup item,'' which
resembles the Garfield cat dolls which some people attach to car
windows.
   ``But there's no getting around it. The appeal for Batman is
somewhat limited and somewhat adult,'' Solomon said.
   ``Last year, we did `Roger Rabbit' merchandise. Now we'll
probably do as much volume with `Batman' as we did with `Roger
Rabbit.' But we did it over a much wider age range with `Roger
Rabbit' than `Batman.'''
   Among those cranking out Batman-related items are View Master,
Hallmark Cards, Butterick Patterns, One-Stop Posters and
Fruit-of-the-Loom.
   The underwear maker is shipping a Batman-festooned children's
brief, part of the company's Funpals Boys Briefs, which includes
ALF, Superman, Looney Tunes and Roger Rabbit.
   ``I think (the Batman underwear) will be one of our top
properties this year, if not the No. 1. seller,'' said
Fruit-of-the-Loom marketing manager Debbie Hills.
   Thermos, too, is confident that its Batman lunch kit _ a lunch
box and an insulated bottle _ will be a hit. ``It's definitely going
to be in the Top 10 in our lineup,'' said Thermos spokesman Gary
Becker. ``Right up there with Barbie and Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles.''

<HEAD>``Batman'' Reflects Growing Use of Old Stories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avoiding the bothersome and time-consuming
process of actually writing original stories, filmmakers are
building new movies from a heap of dusty board games, old songs and
tattered comic books.
   ``Batman'' may not be the only movie adaptation, but the Caped
Crusader may set a record for having the most previous lives _ in a
variety of comic books, a TV series, three television cartoons and
two feature films.
   The latest is the Warner Bros. extravaganza starring Michael
Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as his fiendish foil, the Joker.
   With an average $18 million riding on every studio release, it
pays to stick with retreads. Look at all the ``James Bond'' sequels.
See Jane Fonda remaking ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown'' _ a critically acclaimed movie by Spanish filmmaker
Pedro Almodovar that was released only last year. And watch Columbia
Pictures redo 1963's ``Lord of the Flies.''
   The plots for ``You Light Up My Life'' and ``Ode to Billy Joe''
were taken from old records. ``Clue'' and the upcoming ``Monopoly
the Movie'' were appropriated from parlor games.
   ``Batman,'' like the Superman films and a squadron of other
current and future live-action movies, are all inspired by comic
books: ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Brenda Starr,'' ``The Return of the Swamp
Thing,'' ``The Punisher,'' ``Captain America,'' ``Watchmen,''
``Spiderman,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' and Home Box
Office's ``Tales From the Crypt.''
   ``There's something about the movie business that's really
voracious as far as stories and characters are concerned,'' said
director Wes Craven, who transformed a DC Comic into 1982's ``Swamp
Thing.''
   ``Since the characters and stories in comics are, in a sense,
pre-sold, there's a temptation to use a character that's already got
a running start.''
   Mark Freedman, who spun the independent comic ``Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'' into a toy line, a television series and an upcoming
feature film, said, ``A lot of people didn't realize that comic
books were not necessarily a kiddie medium. ... Some comic books
deal with pretty serious topics.''
   Comics also unfold in a lively style that usually translates
easily to film, suggesting offbeat, imaginative cinematography.
   ``Actually, a comic is a visual movie,'' said the inventor of
``Captain America'' and veteran comic author Jack Kirby. ``It's a
movie drawn by hand.''
   But sometimes for the filmmaker, a comic's catchy graphic look is
as much a blessing as a curse.
   Director Alan Rudolph, attempting to make a movie based on Gary
Larson's ``The Far Side'' comic, has labored to convert Larson's
distinctive caricatures into living, breathing screen images. After
filming a five-minute ``Far Side'' test, Paramount Pictures passed
on the project last year. Rudolph is still trying to convince
another studio that his adaptation can work.
   And while comic-book writers never have to worry about the cost
of elaborate special effects, movie studios do.
   ``The real tricky thing in `Swamp Thing' was that the comic book
had a tremendous amount of mutation _ heads with just hands on them,
strange monsters _ and at that time the budget for the movie was
$2.5 million,'' said Craven. ``The effects were completely outside
of our budget. So we had to deal with more human villains and
creations. I think we used one dwarf.''
   Comic-book characters also have a diversity of personalities, and
movie studios are bound to select the personality with the broadest
possible audience appeal. Take Warner Bros., and its approach to
``Batman.''
   As remembered by fans of the television series and feature film
of the late 1960s, Batman is a campy crimefighter, a goofy
do-gooder. But those familiar with the early DC Comic recollect a
darker, obsessive figure. And in the 1986 Batman graphic novel
collection ``The Dark Knight Returns,'' the Caped Crusader is a
troubled vigilante. The latter two Batmans would never be mistaken
for matinee idols.
   Warner producers didn't seem sure which Batman they wanted. From
the final, dark ``Batman'' script written by Sam Hamm, to the upbeat
shooting script doctored by Warren Skaaren, Batman loses his
paranoid fears. The Joker, cast as a bizarre, overwhelmingly
malevolent criminal in Hamm's screenplay, appears as a droll, almost
lighthearted thug in the finished film.
   And that may leave some comic-book devotees disappointed.
   ``I'm going to see `Batman,''' said Ron Mann, director of the new
documentary ``Comic Book Confidential,'' which traces the history of
the comics. ``But it has nothing to do with the comic book _
absolutely nothing.''

<HEAD>Schools Grapple With Asbestos Cleanup Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``A-Team'' had to wait until classes let
out to descend into the boys' gym office at Dimner Beeber Middle
School so they didn't frighten students with their masks and
billowy, airtight suits.
   Their mission is to remove asbestos insulation from a leaking
steam pipe as required by a federal law that is forcing every school
in the nation to take costly and drastic steps to control a mineral
once used widely as a fire retardant. It is now linked to lung
cancer and other diseases.
   ``I've seen people die of asbestosis,'' said Jim Breslin,
abatement supervisor for the Philadelphia School District and a
former pipe insulator at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. ``I'm not
interested in catching it.''
   It's a fight some say could have been avoided if asbestos
companies had heeded and divulged early warnings of health risks.
Instead, the substance was used in insulation, ceilings, floors and
walls for decades.
   The Philadelphia School District will have to spend $425.6
million to remove asbestos from more than 400 buildings, including
291 used by children, in addition to more than $50 million already
spent on asbestos abatement in the nation's sixth-largest school
district.
   Every school had to submit an asbestos management plan by May 9
or face fines up to $5,000 a day under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency
Response Act of 1986. Some 21 percent of U.S. school systems had
violated the law by not filing plans before the original Oct. 12
deadline or obtaining a deferral to May 9.
   Pennsylvania schools were fifth-worst with 41.3 percent failing
to comply. Indiana had 41.5 percent not in compliance; Maine, 41.9
percent; Virginia, 43.9 percent; and Mississippi, 46.2 percent.
Compliance generally has been higher for public than private
schools, said Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Alicia
Tenuta in Washington.
   An estimated 44,600 of the nation's 107,000 school buildings
contain asbestos that could become dangerous.
   Asbestos fibers can cause asbestosis, a scarring of lung tissue
that diminishes breathing capacity; mesothelioma, a cancer of the
lining of the chest or abdominal cavity; and lung cancer, often long
after exposure.
   The cleanup law requires only management, not removal, of all
asbestos.
   ``We're talking well into the next century for some of this
removal,'' said Bernard Rafferty, district asbestos cleanup chief.
Nevertheless, the district expects to spend $75.8 million fighting
asbestos during the next six years.
   ``We don't question the need to address this environmental
hazard,'' said Albert I. Glassman, associate superintendent for
buildings.
   ``I'm sure responsible school people all over the nation feel the
same way. But we do question the imposition of the total burden for
doing this on the backs of financially strapped school systems.''
   Washington has provided little to offset cleanup costs the EPA
estimates at $3 billion nationwide. From fiscal 1985-1988, $160
million had been distributed under the Asbestos School Hazard
Abatement Act, with $47.5 million to be distributed this year, said
EPA spokesman Lee Blackburn.
   ``It's clear there's limited resources for schools and a lot of
other demands _ educational reform issues, increasing teachers
salaries, drug education,'' said Joel C. Packer, coordinator of the
Washington-based Asbestos In Schools Coalition. His organization is
pushing for more federal money.
   The law requires states to review plans and monitor abatement.
   The Department of Environmental Resources, ordered by Gov. Robert
P. Casey to review the plans, was 3{ months late with its report on
compliance. It gave Pennsylvania schools a higher mark than EPA,
with 36 percent noncompliance, but the DER still is developing ways
to review the plans, casting uncertainty over cleanups that the law
requires to start by July 9.
   ``School districts either cannot go ahead with removal work or
run the risk of having to do work over again if it is not approved
by DER,'' said state Sen. Mike Fisher, chairman of the Senate
Environmental Resources and Energy Committee.
   ``We have acknowledged that we've had a slow start, but we're
moving very aggressively now,'' DER Deputy Secretary Mark M.
McClellan said. The department is adding staff and plans to hire
contractors this summer to speed the reviews.
   Much of the problem is the constant change brought on by the
fragility of asbestos, even after it is declared contained. ``Kids
knock up against it with their chairs, stick a pencil in it, or a
water leak occurs and breaks it down,'' said Glassman.
   Those cases are treated as emergencies by the 30-member full-time
``A-Team'' trained in an EPA-certified program. A ``C-Team'' of 60
maintenance workers has been cleared for part-time work. Both teams
use the same procedures as workers in other schools once a problem
is located.
   Using plastic sheeting, the Beeber A-Team has sealed the boy's
gym office where the leaking pipe was found. Workers pass through
two additional chambers of plastic that serve as safety traps. The
office is ventilated by a filter that catches 99.97 percent of any
fibers. Each worker going in dons two suits of a non-breathable
synthetic material. A health hygienist monitors the air they breathe
through masks.
   When work begins in earnest this week with the end of school, the
asbestos will be sprayed with a wetting agent, cut with a razor
knife, sprayed again and bagged. No more than 20 pounds per bag
because the bag might break.
   On the way out, the workers shed one suit in one chamber, the
second in the second chamber, to ensure no fibers leave with them.
By the time they are done, air samples must show less than 0.01
fibers per cubic centimeter. ``At times it might seem like overkill,
but you never know when you're going to have a problem,'' Breslin
said.
   Each step is recorded: the date work started, how much asbestos
is removed, where it is taken, how many fibers showed up on samples.
   ``Since there's such a long gestation period for these cancers
and these cancerlike diseases, it's possible that 30, 40, 50 years
would go by and then someone who gets cancer would file a personal
injury suit,'' said Patricia Donovan, attorney for the school
district.
   ``I don't want my successors to have to try to reconstruct what
happened in 1988, 1989 and 1990.''

   The government ordered that new cars sold in
the United States have lap and shoulder safety belts for two

   Carmakers have prepared for the rule and more than half of
1989-model cars have such belts, but an industry official said
Monday the order may speed up installations carmakers had planned
for 1990 models.
   The rule takes effect in mid-December and will apply to all cars
built after that, except convertibles. Vans, small trucks and
utility vehicles would also be unaffected. The agency has announced
plans to include all such vehicles at a later date, possibly for the
1991 model year.

<HEAD>Cash-Short Control Data To Sell Imprimis Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. says it intends to
sell a subsidiary that accounted for a third of its revenue last
year in another step by the troubled computer maker to raise cash.
   Control Data said Monday it will sell its computer data storage
subsidiary to California-based Seagate Technology for $300 million
in cash and notes and $150 million worth of Seagate stock.
   The data storage unit, Imprimis Technology, was established as a
separate Control Data subsidiary last year and accounted for a third
of the company's $3.6 billion in revenue, said spokeswoman Nancy
Foltz.
   Proceeds from the proposed sale, which must be approved by the
boards of directors at both companies and undergo government review,
will be used for repayment of debt and to provide additional working
capital, Chairman Robert Price said.
   The companies expect to reach a definitive agreement over the
next several months.
   In mid-April, Control Data shut down its ETA Systems
supercomputer subsidiary and announced the layoff of 3,100 employees
in a move that it said would cost $350 million and raise the
company's second-quarter write-down to $490 million.
   At the same time, Control Data _ once one of the world's largest
computer makers _ said it would sell parts of the company to obtain
loans beyond those available under its current banking agreement.
   Seagate, a maker of data storage devices based in Scotts Valley,
Calif., would finance the purchase by giving Control Data $250
million in cash and a $50 million promissory note. Control Data also
would get a seat on Seagate's board of directors, the company said.

last week.
   Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.79 percent, down from 7.99 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.98
percent Dec. 12 and six-month bills averaged 7.71 percent Nov. 7.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.42 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,794.50 and 8.22 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,606.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.40
percent last week, down from 8.80 percent the previous week.

   Britain's Civil Aviation Authority on Monday
grounded all 12 Boeing 737-400 aircraft operated by British carriers
following two recent engine failures.
   Both incidents involved damage to fan blades in CFM56-3C engines
manufactured by SNECMA of France in a joint venture with General
Electric Co. The same engine and plan also was involved in a fatal
crash in January.
   In Seattle, KIRO-TV reported that Federal Aviation Administration
officials were preparing an airworthiness directive based on the
British action, but there was no immediate indication what the
contents would be.
   Spokesman T. Craig Martin of Boeing Co. in Seattle confirmed only
that there had been talks Monday between FAA officials and
representatives of the manufacturer.
   ``We consider our communications with the FAA to be essentially
private,'' Martin said.
   On Friday, a Dan-Air 737-400 carrying 100 charter passengers to
Minorca returned to London's Gatwick airport after developing severe
vibration in one engine.
   The airline said the problem developed 15 minutes into the flight
at an altitude of 31,000 feet.
   On Sunday, a British Midlands 737-400 flying from London's
Heathrow airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with 80 people aboard
made an emergency landing at East Midlands airport after a problem
developed in one engine.
   In both cases, the airlines reported that turbofan blades had
been damaged.
   Questions had been raised about the engines in January after the
crash of a British Midlands Boeing 737-400 at East Midlands airport
that killed 47 people.
   The plane was equipped with the CFM56-3C engines. The pilot had
reported that one engine had failed in flight, but investigators
later found the plane's good engine had been shut down before the
emergency landing was attempted.
   The investigation of that crash has not been completed.

<HEAD>Eastern Says FAA Inspection Shows `No Irregularities'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says it
continues to monitor maintenance practices at strikebound Eastern
Airlines, although the company and an FAA spokesman say the agency
told Eastern informally it had turned up no irregularities in
maintenance paperwork.
   In a recording played since Friday on its toll-free telephone
``hot line'' for employees, Eastern said the FAA has advised it that
recent inspections at maintenance hubs in Miami and Atlanta did not
uncover any systemwide problems.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar in Washington said Monday he couldn't
confirm the agency told Eastern no paperwork irregularities had been
found. He said the final report on a record-keeping investigation
that ended May 12 had not yet been submitted to acting FAA
Administrator Robert E. Whittington.
   But Jack Barker, an FAA spokesman in Atlanta, confirmed that the
agency had told Eastern the information in question. He also noted
that the final report hasn't yet been given to Whittington.
   Eastern's unions and others have raised questions about
maintenance and safety at the airline, which has weathered a
crippling strike since March 4.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House
subcommittee on Government Activities and Transportation, recently
wrote Whittington that she was concerned that shortages of staff and
spare parts could be hampering Eastern's ability to properly
maintain its fleet.
   Farrar said the FAA undertook a ``special surveillance'' of
Eastern's overall safety after the strike began, although he said
``There is no separate, distinct inspection currently going on
vis-a-vis Eastern's maintenance.''
   Robin Matell, a spokesman for Eastern in Miami, said the
telephone recording was made by Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock on
Friday.
   ``FAA informally advised us today that the Miami and Atlanta
maintenance inspections turned up no irregularities in paperwork or
gaps in missing records,'' the recording said.
   ``The FAA concluded that it could not discover any evidence
showing a systemwide maintenance problem (at Eastern) with improper
record entries or missing documents,'' Ashlock said on the tape,
which still was being played Monday.
   Eastern's recording also said the FAA had reinstated eight
Eastern maintenance supervisors at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport who had been temporarily suspended.
   Early last month, Eastern temporarily surrendered its repair
station certificate at JFK after the FAA determined the carrier had
failed to follow its system for recording and inspecting maintenance
work.
   But Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman in the FAA's Eastern Region
office at Kennedy Airport, said Monday that any suspensions or
reinstatements of Eastern personnel would have been made by the
airline itself, not the agency.
   ``We never took any action against any individuals,'' she said.
   The suspension of the JFK certificate was for actions that
predated the March 4 start of the strike, which pushed Eastern into
bankruptcy court five days later.
   Soon after the JFK certificate was pulled, the FAA sent nine
inspectors to Eastern's main base in Miami to determine if
violations of maintenance record- keeping rules, such as those found
in New York, existed in Miami and Atlanta.
   JFK, Miami International and Atlanta's Hartsfield International
are the sites of Eastern's three principal maintenance facilities.
   In her June 1 letter to Whittington, Collins said her
subcommittee's staff reviewed internal company documents indicating
that ``manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the
maintenance function of Eastern.''
   Collins, who is recovering from recent surgery, was reported to
be unavailable to comment Monday on the Eastern recording.
   Although the FAA says it is not conducting a special
investigation of Eastern maintenance practices at Miami and Atlanta,
Eastern's pilots union contends the union has participated in such a
probe.
   Representatives of the pilots and Machinists unions met with FAA
inspectors May 15-16 in the context of that inquiry, according to a
pilots union spokesman who asked not to be identified.

   The advertising agency Hill Holiday and the
commercial production company Sedelmaier were the single biggest
winners at the Clio Awards for television advertising, taking four
trophies each.
   The New York office of Boston-based Hill Holiday won three Clios
on Monday in the copywriting, original music with lyrics and travel
categories for a commercial called ``Invaders'' for the Irish
Tourist Board.
   The agency's fourth Clio was for a commercial for Revlon in the
cosemtics category.
   Sedelmaier, which is based in Chicago, won two Clios in the humor
and utilities categories for a commercial for U.S. Sprint.
   It won two Clios in the classics category _ for ads that first
appeared at least five years ago _ for a 1980 ad called
``Secretary'' for Federal Express and a 1984 ad called ``Russian
Fashion Show'' for Wendy's.
   A private company named for the Clio Awards has presented the
Clios annually for 30 years.
   The Clio for the best national television campaign went to the ad
agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., for work on behalf of
athletic shoe maker Nike Inc. that featured the football and
baseball player Bo Jackson, marathon runner Priscilla Welch and the
octogenarian runner Walt Stack.
   The agency also won two Clios in the apparel and cable
TV-national categories for Nike ads.
   The Clio for the best regional television campaign went to the ad
agency Levine Huntley Schmidt &amp; Beaver of New York for its work for
Beneficial Finance. Levine also won a Clio for the ads in the
banking-financial category.
   Clios for print, radio and packaging design were presented Friday.
   The big winners in those categories were Fallon McElligott of
Minneapolis with 11 Clios in print, the production company Dick
Orkin's Radio Ranch of Los Angeles with six Clios in radio, and the
design company Sidjakov Berman Gomez of San Francisco with four
Clios for packaging design.

<HEAD>Preacher's Downfall Hurts Already-Depressed Baton Rouge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preacher Jimmy Swaggart's admission of
sin was a blow not only to his television ministry but to the
economy of a city that already was hurting from the downturn in the
oil industry.
   At its peak, Swaggart's ministry was a $150-million-a-year
operation. It remains one of the biggest industries in the area, but
area business owners and managers know that they aren't as well off
as they were before scandal touched the fundamentalist evangelist.
   ``When you take a $150 million industry and cripple it, of course
the entire community's going to feel it,'' said Butch Spyridon,
executive director of the Baton Rouge Area Convention and Visitors
Bureau.
   It was in February 1988 when Swaggart confessed to moral failure
from the stage of his Family Worship Center church at the heart of
his 270-acre compound. Although Swaggart didn't admit specifics, a
rival minister revealed that the transgression involved liaisons
with a New Orleans prostitute.
   Baton Rouge's economy has paid along with Swaggart for his sins.
   ``Where I used to get 150 rooms a night, now I may get 75,'' said
Craig Michelet, manager of a Holiday Inn near Swaggart's compound.
``And I'm probably the only hotel in Baton Rouge still getting any
of that business.''
   Michelet remembers the old days fondly _ Swaggart's followers
never got rowdy and didn't frequent the motel bar.
   ``They were the easiest guests you could have,'' Michelet said.
``It was great business.''
   The huge ministry had scheduled nine conventions in 1988 expected
to pull 45,000 delegates and $14 million into the Baton Rouge
economy.
   Most would have come for the family-oriented, four-day ``camp
meetings'' Swaggart usually scheduled over holiday periods that
traditionally generated little tourist-oriented revenue.
   ``We lost millions last year, although (some) of that was on
paper because he had more meetings scheduled for 1988 than ever
before,'' Spyridon said.
   ``His ministry has been our largest single supplier of convention
delegates. Make no mistake about it. Jimmy Swaggart was good
business for Baton Rouge.
   ``And he still is. He still draws. It just isn't what it used to
be,'' the visitor-bureau director added. ``And we've really hustled
to try and book more groups and make up for what we lost from Mr.
Swaggart's problems. Fortunately, we managed to land the U.S. Hot
Air Balloon National Championships for 1989-1991.''
   Almost half the faculty has left the Jimmy Swaggart Bible
College. Many left to save their credentials with the Assemblies of
God, the denomination that defrocked Swaggart when he refused to
accept a one-year rehabilitation church leaders ordered.
   Many have left the state for employment and schools elsewhere,
dumping homes and apartments onto a real estate market already
suffering with the rest of Louisiana from the downturn in the
state's oil-based economy.
   Faculty members from the Bible college are among about 600
employees who have either been laid off or left Swaggart's employ
since the ministry boasted in its 1986 heyday that its roster of
1,400-plus employees and $16 million payroll had a ``snowball''
spending effect that infused about $30.5 million into the Baton
Rouge economy.
   Attendance at the college is off by about 75 percent _ from 1,450
in 1987 to 400 now.
   Since 1981, the ministry spent more than $123 million on
construction and land purchases, making it the largest sponsor of
construction in East Baton Rouge Parish over the past five years.
   But the first activity Swaggart's tearful confession stopped at
the complex was construction.
   A new $9 million Bible college dormitory still stands
half-finished. Work was frozen and properties were mortgaged for $12
million to cover construction debts, records show.
   ``Jimmy still brings people in. He still makes business for Baton
Rouge,'' said Don Gerald Jr., vice president of a restaurant near
Swaggart's ministries.
   But it's not what it used to be, Gerald said.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Walk Off Job, Predict Long Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In one day, the number of coal miners on
strike in Appalachia increased fivefold, and many of the union
members who have walked off the job expect their numbers will swell
even more.
   ``They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-union
mines by the end of next week,'' said Dave Evans, a Pittston Coal
Group Inc. miner. ``You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _
whatever it takes to get this settled.''
   At issue is a 2-month-old walkout by the UMW against Pittston
over wage, benefit and work-rule disputes. But miners say that's not
all that's at stake: Many believe that if Pittston wins, a precedent
will be set that could reverse gains made by labor unions early this
century.
   About 1,600 union miners have been striking Pittston operations
in Virginia and West Virginia since early April. On Monday,
thousands of miners at other coal companies in Appalachia walked off
the job, many saying they have to take a stand now or lose their
union rights.
   ``It's going to be the same for all coal miners if Pittston beats
the UMW on this,'' said one miner who walked off his job Monday at
Hobet Mining in Mingo County.
   Underground miners in West Virginia refused to show up for the
overnight shift Monday, less than eight hours after many attended a
rally at which UMW President Richard Trumka told them to ``rise up
and fight back.''
   Three West Virginia mines also reported workers failed to return
for today's midnight shift.
   ``Whatever it's gonna take to get the court systems to drop the
fines and get our fellas out of jail in Virginia, that's how long
it'll last,'' said Perry Harvey, a UMW field representative in Logan.
   The UMW already was involved in a two-state strike against
Pittston and a smaller strike against New Beckley Mining in Raleigh
County. In the Pittston strike, a state judge in Virginia jailed
three union leaders and fined the union $3 million for disobeying a
court order limiting pickets.
   Monday's wildcat strikes spread to operations throughout the rest
of UMW District 17, which has 8,000 members in southern West
Virginia. The president of the West Virginia Coal Association
estimated 10,000 miners refused to show up for work.
   ``It's fair to say that all of southern West Virginia is
affected, as far as I can tell,'' said Gary White, president of the
coal association.
   West Virginia's largest coal field employer, Consolidation Coal,
said only one of its operations was struck, but it immediately asked
for and obtained a court order telling its workers to return to work.
   Attorneys for the company argued that when the 250 of its 4,000
workers walked out, they violated terms of a 1988 contract barring
strikes and that their walkout could keep the company from meeting
its contracts.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp agreed and ordered the men back
to the Rowland mine pending another hearing June 22, when the
temporary order expires.
   Peabody Coal, the nation's top coal producer, saw 2,360 union
miners walk out at midnight Sunday, said Tom Clarke, a Peabody
attorney.
   Pittston miners struck April 5 after working more than 14 months
without a contract. Pittston had refused to sign the 1988 Bituminous
Coal Operators Association agreement that most other coal companies
had signed. About 100 miners have been striking at New Beckley since
January.
   Over the course of the Pittston walkout by 1,600 miners in
Virginia and West Virginia, more than 2,200 miners, retirees and
their wives have been arrested for civil disobedience such as
blocking coal trucks.
   Union leaders did not return several telephone calls from The
Associated Press seeking comment. The leaders have repeatedly
stressed that the strike was not sanctioned by the union.
   Under terms of the 1988 BCOA agreement, miners can take a 10-day
``memorial period'' to air grievences. None of the coal companies
struck Monday said they were informed that this would be a 10-day
work stoppage.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire Harold C. Simmons says he
boosted his stake in Lockheed Corp., to more than 6 percent from 4.2
percent, for investment purposes, not to mount a takeover of the
defense contractor.
   Simmons revealed Monday that Valhi Inc., NL Industries Inc. and
various other Simmons companies had spent $69.27 million, including
commissions, to purchase 1.44 million shares of Lockheed stock
between May 15 and Thursday.
   The purchases, which ranged in price from $47 to $49 per share,
make him one of the largest individual shareholders in the
Calabasas, Calif.-based company.
   Lockheed stock inched up 62.5 cents to close at $49.62{ in
composite trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons
said the lastest purchases were ``for purposes of investment and in
order to acquire a significant equity interest in the company.''
   The filing said Simmons does not ``currently have any plans to
acquire control of the company by stock ownership or otherwise,''
although it did not rule out such a move in the future.
   Earlier this year, Simmons revealed a 5.3 percent stake in the
company, prompting Lockheed to create an employee stock ownership
plan that effectively blocked any takeover ploy. One day after the
creation of the ESOP, which holds 17 percent of Lockheed stock,
Simmons reduced his holding to 4.2 percent.
   Analysts have said the ESOP's holding effectively blocks a
Lockheed takeover because in Delaware, where the company is
incorporated, a buyout must be approved by holders of 85 percent of
a company's stock.
   Simmons' SEC filing said he met with Lockheed Chairman Daniel M.
Tellep and Vice Chairman Vincent N. Marafino on May 15, the same day
Simmons began his recent purchases, to discuss his investment.
   Lockheed spokesman Ron Meder described the meeting as
``cordial,'' but said the company would have no further comment on
Simmons' action.
   In the filing, Simmons included a March 31 letter to Tellep
saying, ``We view Lockheed as a well managed company. We have no
plans, or desire, to disrupt management. We expect to be a
constructive, long-term shareholder.''
   Analysts said Monday they believe that description still holds.
   Steven Kinney, who follows Valhi for Baird, Patrick &amp; Co. Inc. in
New York, said Simmons' ``first and foremost'' duty is to enhance
stockholder value and ``greed and calculation will always be second
to this interest.''
   He suggested Simmons hopes to make money on the Lockheed stock to
use in other possible takeover moves.
   Simmons, whose worth is estimated at $1.5 billion by Fortune
magazine, has holdings in chemical, timber and sugar industries.

<TEXT>
   The government is giving carmakers six months
to equip all new hardtop cars with backseat lap and shoulder belts,
but a safety research group says the new rule doesn't go far enough.
   Industry officials, meanwhile, said the order announced Monday by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Admnistration came as no
surprise but nonetheless might speed up some planned installations.
   More than half of 1989 cars already have such belts, and they are
scheduled for nearly all 1990 models, industry and government
officials said.
   The rule will apply to all cars built after mid-December, except
convertibles, which are unlikely to be affected until the 1991 model
year.
   The safety agency said it was still working on detailed
installation requirements for the rear-seat belts as well as orders
requiring them for convertibles, vans, small trucks and utility
vehicles.
   ``Today's action makes the United States one of the first major
vehicle-producing nations in the world to require rear-seat lap and
shoulder belts by regulation,'' the highway safety agency said in
announcing the rule.
   Brian O'Neill, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, said testing rules are needed to ensure that shoulder safety
belt systems work properly in each car's back seat.
   ``Our position is that if all you do is write a rule that the
manufacturers are already following, it's not worth doing,'' O'Neill
said.
   Rear seat cushions in some cars may be too soft or improperly
designed for effective shoulder belt use in the rear, he said. The
institute is an independent, nonprofit research and educational
organization funded by the insurance industry.
   In addition to the rear lap-shoulder belts, 1990 models must have
front-seat air bags or automatic shoulder restraints. Carmakers can
either install dual air bags, dual automatic restraints, or a single
air bag on the driver's side and a manual or automatic restraint on
the passenger's side.
   Air bags inflate in a crash. Automatic restraints move into place
as the driver or passenger enters the car.
   The highway safety administration, which is part of the
Department of Transportation, said about 2,000 rear-seat passengers
die each year in road crashes, and 600 lives could be saved if even
existing lap belts were used by everyone riding in the back seat.
   The agency did not estimate the number of lives that might be
saved with the new order, which would not affect any cars now on the
road. However, if both shoulder and lap belts were used by the 16
percent of back-seat passengers who now use lap-only belts, it said,
25 more lives and 500 serious injuries could be avoided each year.
   Government surveys show that front-seat safety belt use has
reached an all-time high of 47 percent, with 33 states and the
District of Columbia requiring their use. Use of rear-seat belts has
increased eightfold over the last six years, with five states
requiring it, officials said.
   Fred Bowditch, vice president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association in Detroit, said 50 percent to 60 percent of 1989 cars
have both lap and shoulder belts as standard equipment in the rear
seat.
   He said all manufacturers had planned to put the belts on even
without a federal order ``in the next year or two.'' He said the
order ``may hurry up the schedule a little bit for a few models.''
   According to the insurance institute, lap and shoulder belts are
optional for the rear seat on Chrysler cars and on some Ford models
but are already standard equipment on many Ford and on all General
Motors cars and most foreign autos sold in the United States.

   The newly established Bahrain stock
exchange will start trading on Saturday, about six months later than
originally planned, its director announced Tuesday.
   Fawzi Behzad told a news conference the opening was delayed in
order to complete discussions with financial authorities on
market-activity rules. He said the dealing hall, located in the
city's financial center, also had to be completed.
   Behzad and other officials say they hope the island's stock
exchange will become the Wall Street of the Gulf region.
   ``Now we deal in local Bahrain companies. We chall be moving to
Gulf companies ... then to the international companies,'' he said.
   The Bahrain exchange will seek to attract private Arab wealth
accumulated during the 1970s oil boom that is currently invested
abroad. Such holdings are estimated at around $150 billion.
   Its cautious beginning reflects official determination to avoid
overheating of the kind that triggered the 1982 crash of Kuwait's
unofficial Al-Manakh stock market under the pressure of $94 billion
worth of post-dated checks.
   Behzad said the market would trade for just 90 minutes daily, and
will close on Fridays, the Moslem weekend.
   He said five individual brokers and two financial companies would
trade stock of 29 Bahraini national companies that have a combined
total of 4.4 billion shares. Their total nominal value is set at
$1.6 billion.
   Share values will be limited to a 15 percent move up or down on
any trading day.
   Nationals of other Gulf Cooperation Council states will be
allowed to deal on the Bahrain market, but company ownership
percentages have not yet been defined, Behzad said.
   The GCC, which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia, has set the ceiling for ownership by
citizens of one member-country in companies of another at 25 percent.
   Behzad said the stock exchange's founding decree permits eventual
trading in government bonds, real estate and other financial
instruments but set no date for the expansion.
   The Bahrain stock exchange opening comes as the Gulf region
anticipates an economic recovery based on improved oil prices and
reconstruction after last August's cease-fire in the 8-year
Iran-Iraq war.
   Behzad said he hoped that each GCC country would eventually have
its own exchange so that ``we shall be able to coordinate for the
future ... It will push a Gulf market in general.''
   Oman last month opened a small-scale stock exchange where GCC
nationals are permitted to deal. Kuwait has had an official stock
exchange since the mid-1970s and is reactivating the unofficial
Al-Manakh market, while unofficial trading is carried out in Saudi
Arabia.

<HEAD>HCA Sells Two More Divisions To Reduce Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospital Corp. of America has sold two
more divisions, bringing to five the number of subsidiaries spun off
by the health care giant since it began restructuring three years
ago.
   Company officials announced Monday Nashville-based HCA is selling
HCA Management Co. Inc. to the division's employees for $43 million.
   Late Monday night, the firm announced the sale of HCA Psychiatric
Co. for $1.25 billion in cash to the top managers of that company
and to employees through an employee stock ownership plan.
   Both deals are subject to various conditions, including approval
by the HCA board of directors and completion of certain regulatory
requirements.
   The management division sale is expected to close within 60 days,
while sale of the psychiatric subsidiary should be completed during
the second half of 1989, according to a statement from HCA.
   The spinoffs are designed to meet HCA Chairman Thomas F. Frist
Jr.'s goal of paring HCA back from what was a spreading medical
conglomerate to a company focusing solely on acute care medical
hospitals.
   Still to be sold are HCA's international operations, expected to
bring in excess of $150 million.
   After all the spinoffs are completed, HCA will be left with about
80 acute care domestic hospitals with about $3 billion in annual
revenues.
   The buyers of HCA Management Co. were led by the subsidiary's
senior management and the New York investment firm of Welsh, Carson,
Anderson &amp; Stowe. They agreed in principle to purchase the
outstanding capital stock of HCA Management. HCA will retain 10
percent ownership in the company.
   HCA Management provides management and consulting services to
more than 230 hospitals and health care facilities totaling more
than 38,000 beds in 44 states and Canada. The company employs more
than 700 people nationwide, including 160 at its Nashville
headquarters.
   Under the psychiatric division agreement, HCA will retain $150
million of the company's preferred stock and will acquire warrants
to purchase from 15 percent to 30 percent of the common stock of the
psychiatric company.
   HCA Psychiatric Co. owns 52 psychiatric and chemical dependency
facilities in the United States with approximately 5,500 beds and
has 6,500 employees.
   The subsidiaries bring to three the number that HCA has sold in a
week _ and to five the number it has sold since 1986. HCA spun off
Allied Clinical Laboratories last week for $44.6 million to a
management team led by Haywood Cochrane, Allied's chief executive
officer.
   Company officials said the sales will help pay off $1.3 billion
in debts due over the next two years.
   In October 1986, HCA sold its HCA Health Plans division for more
than $400 million to Equicor, a joint venture between HCA and The
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.
   Nearly a year later, in September 1987, the company sold 104
rural and suburban hospitals for $2 billion to a management-led
group that formed a new company called HealthTrust Inc.
   Earlier this year, Frist led a management group which took HCA
private for $3.6 billion. The financing arrangements give HCA two
years to sell at least $1.3 million in assets to pay off a
short-term loan included in the $4 billion financing package.

<HEAD>Japan Begins Trading in Stock Index Options</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Osaka Stock Exchange has begun Japan's first
trading in stock index options, and transactions in the first two
days totaled more than $1 billion, the exchange said Tuesday.
   The trading, begun Monday, aims at offering new investing
opportunities to institutional investors, who handle an increasing
amount of individuals' financial assets, said an OSE official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange and Nagoya Stock Exchange are expected
to follow Osaka's lead later this year.
   The official said contracts on the first day totaled 268,000,
valued at $869 million, but dealings declined to 65,249 contracts
valued at $207 million on Tuesday.
   He said daily trading on the world's largest option trading
market, the Chicago Board Option Exchange, has been estimated at $73
million.
   The official said the Osaka trading is based on the Nikkei index
of 225 selected stocks. Option contracts give investors the right,
but not the obligation, to buy or sell the ``basket'' of stocks.
   Like stock option trading elsewhere in the world, Osaka's system
permits investors to hedge their stock portfolios against sudden
price fluctuations.
   At an opening ceremony Monday, Hiroshi Yamanouchi, the OSE
president, said the stock index options trading system would combine
with Japan's existing stock index futures system to bring a notable
expansion in the country's capital and other financial markets.
   The OSE official said non-Japanese companies participating in the
stock index option trading are Baring Securities Japan Ltd. of
Britain; Sogen Securities North Pacific Ltd. of France; and seven
American companies including BT Asia Securities Ltd., Merrill Lynch
Japan Inc., Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc., Smith Barney, Harris
Upham International Inc., Goldman Sachs International Corp., Morgan
Stanley Japan Ltd. and Solomon Brothers Asia Ltd.

   Next Inc., founded after Steve Jobs left
Apple Computer in 1985, has landed a $100 million investment from
Canon Inc., the Japanese electronics giant.
   Under the deal announced Monday, Canon, which will have sole
distribution rights to the Next Computer System in Asia, gained a
16.67 stake in Next, a company valued at $600 million.
   Jobs said he will not have to give up any rights to Next's
technology or control over its manufacturing. Every machine Canon
sells will be built in Fremont and carry the label of the Palo Alto
company.
   ``We hope this will erase anybody's worries about Next's
long-term financial stability,'' Jobs told reporters. ``The money's
in the bank.''
   The importance of the Asian market led to the deal, said Jobs,
president and chief executive officer of Next.
   ``We decided we needed a partner,'' Jobs said. ``We don't have 20
years to go it alone. We want to be a factor in Japan in 1990.''
   Canon has been working with Next on its computer design and is
supplying an optical storage device.
   Jobs now holds 50 percent of his company, employees hold 20
percent and investor H. Ross Perot has 12.5 percent.
   Hiroshi Tanaka, senior marketing director for Canon, said he
expects to start selling the Next computer by the end of the year.
Next will initially provide Canon with English language software,
but the company expects to have a Japanese character version of the
computer available some time next year.

<HEAD>Security Pacific Bids For Two Ailing Texas Banking Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp., one of the nation's
largest bank holding companies, says it is bidding for two large
ailing Texas banks.
   The plan would require assurances that the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. would assume the risks of existing bad loans,
Security Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Robert H. Smith said
Monday.
   Security Pacific said it has submitted the proposal to the FDIC
to acquire the subsidiary bank of Texas American Bancshares in Fort
Worth and National Bancshares in San Antonio.
   The two Texas banking companies have combined assets of about $7
billion, but losses in 1988 totaling $700 million, largely caused by
problems with real estate loans.
   ``If the losses can be defined as someone else's, we will take
the remaining portfolio,'' said Smith. ``We think it can be very
attractive, and we can compete very well. There is a lot of
efficiency to be gained and a lot of creative products that can be
provided.''

<HEAD>Board of Trade Tries Home-Mortgage Contract Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite four failed attempts to offer a futures
contract based on home-mortgage rates, the Chicago Board of Trade
has decided it will try once again starting Friday.
   The contract will track the current coupon for the Government
National Mortgage Association, known as GNMA or Ginnie Mae, and will
be traded four months in the future in units of $100,000.
   The BOT first tried the contract in 1975, and again in 1978, 1984
and 1986. Each eventually fell by the wayside, either because of the
complexity of the design or a lack of interest from local traders
that kept the contract from being liquid enough to sustain itself.
   Officials expect this version to succeed because of its
simplicity.
   ``Potentially, the market is bigger than the corporate bond
market and with the volatility in mortgages in recent years, there
seems to be a real need for some sort of hedging device,'' BOT
spokesman Mike O'Connell said Monday.
   ``This should look attractive to savings and loans, mortgage
bankers, anybody who originates mortgages or deals in
mortgage-backed securities.''
   Traditionally, institutional holders of mortgages and
mortgage-backed securities bought U.S. Treasury securities or
over-the-counter options as a hedge.
   But BOT officials say the new contract will provide better
protection against sudden swings in the interest rate by offering a
futures contract that can be matched up with a cash position.
   ``Let's say you hold a (GNMA) coupon for 10 percent. Suddenly,
interest rates drop to 9 percent and everybody refinances their
mortgages. Now, you've got a check for the original amount, but no
longer the revenue stream you thought you would have,'' said Sam
Kahan, economist for Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.,
Chicago.
   ``You could have hedged that if you were able to find a futures
position that mirrored your cash position.''
   But Kahan, mindful of four failed efforts at such a contract,
withheld a prediction on whether investors would take to the product.
   James Florsheim, a Chicago Corp. vice president and hedging
consultant and broker for financial institutions, said big customers
will ``be the ones to make this product go.
   ``The savings-and-loan mentality used to be that when you got
caught holding mortgages behind interest rates, you put the losers
in a drawer and waited until you could get the value back,''
Florsheim said.
   ``The idea now is to get the S&amp;Ls back into the ballgame,'' he
said, ``and giving them a hedge like this might be a step in the
right direction. People are more aware of the need for this now than
at times in the past.''

   Share prices moved broadly lower in early trading
today, as the stock market failed to build on the rebound that
developed Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.55 points to
2,504.29 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outpaced gainers by a wide margin on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 721 down, 285 up and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.31 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was off
by 0.95, at 181.19.
   Wall Street analysts said the early selling reflected further
profit-taking and not a fundamental change in sentiment toward the
stock market.
   A report from the Commerce Department showing retail sales rose a
sluggish 0.1 percent in May, virtually matched expectations and had
little impact on stocks, analysts said.
   In the early going, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric led the list of
actively traded NYSE-issues, and was unchanged at 19~.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of
5.42 at 2,518.84, after remaining in the minus-column for much of
the session.
   The NYSE's composite index ended at 182.14, down 0.23.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a small margin on the
NYSE, with 758 down, 713 up and 509 unchanged.

<HEAD>Government Forecasters Predict Near-Record Citrus Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Florida's citrus industry heads into the
home stretch of the 1988-1989 harvest, government forecasters
reported about 2 million more boxes of oranges harvested than they
had calculated last month.
   The larger crop estimate translates to about $24 million more in
industry income, with prices for Valencia oranges running at about
$12 a box delivered to processing plants.
   ``The final value of the crop should be up there near the
record'' of $1.3 billion set last season, said Bob Terry, citrus
statistician with the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service in
Orlando.
   The joint federal and state forecasting service projected Monday
that the harvest, which ends July 1, will total 146.3 million boxes
of oranges and 55.35 million boxes of grapefruit. A box of oranges
is equivalent to 90 pounds of fruit, and a box of grapefruit is
equal to 85 pounds.
   While the orange forecast increased 2 million boxes from last
month's estimate because of the bigger Valencia crop, the grapefruit
estimate was reduced by 500,000 boxes. The grapefruit crop still
would be a record, however, just surpassing the 54.8 million-box
bumper crop picked in 1979-1980.
   Terry said both the orange and grapefruit adjustments were made
to reflect amounts of fruit actually appearing in processing and
packing plants.
   California citrus forecasters also have had some difficulty
nailing down the size of that state's crop, second in size to
Florida's among U.S. producers.
   California, which is just completing its early and midseason
orange harvest, reduced its early and midcrop estimate by 1 million
boxes to 34 million and lowered its Valencia forecast by 2 million
boxes to 23 million. California's harvest typically lags behind
Florida's by three or four months because of differences in climate.
   Crop forecasters predicted Monday that the juice yield for
Florida oranges would remain the same at 1.53 gallons of
concentrated juice per box.
   The last crop estimate of the season will be made July 12, and
the final numbers for the completed season will be released Sept.
29, just before the start of the new harvest on Oct. 1.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following an
Agriculture Department report estimating the U.S. winter wheat crop
at an 11-year low.
   In a report issued after the close of trading Monday, the USDA
pegged the drought-ravaged winter wheat crop at 1.41 billion
bushels, down 10 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent
below the May forecast.
   But buying enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for
drier-than-normal conditions early next week in the Great Plains,
which would accelerate the winter wheat harvest.
   Corn and soybean futures were supported in part by indications of
strong export sales of those commodities last week. But lower prices
in Europe for soybean meal and soybean oil kept a lid on the rally.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1} cents higher with July at $2.50{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to
2 cents higher with July at $1.59} a bushel; soybeans were { cent to
2\ cents higher with July at $6.95\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
70.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .22 cent lower
with August at 80.45 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .22 cent
higher with June at 48.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .67 cent higher with July at 34.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures advanced on Monday.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Tops $30 Billion in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs with other economic reports today; Also moved on
general news wires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade worsened dramatically in the first three months of the year,
widening to $30.69 billion, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account
was 7 percent larger than the $28.68 billion imbalance run up in the
final three months of 1988.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also transactions in services, primarily
investment flows between countries.
   The merchandise trade deficit improved sharply in the first
quarter, narrowing by 13.7 percent to $27.63 billion. However, this
improvement was wiped out by a decline in the services category,
which fell to a tiny $369 million surplus from a surplus of $8.36
billion in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Analysts said the steep drop in the services surplus reflected
the fact that the dollar rose in the first quarter, lowering
American businesses' earnings overseas.
   The current account provides a measure of the amount of money
this country must raise abroad to finance its economy. The United
States, because of huge merchandise trade deficits, was transformed
from the world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor
country during the 1980s.
   Simply put, that means that foreigners now own more U.S. assets
than Americans hold overseas. Both the Reagan and Bush
administrations have claimed that this is a sign of strength,
showing that the United States remains a popular place to invest.
   However, private economists have warned that the growing debt
burden will ultimately lower America's standard of living as more
and more dollars are handed over to foreigners as interest payments
on the debt.
   With the $30.69 billion current account deficit in the first
quarter, the imbalance between U.S. holdings abroad and foreign
holdings in the United States has probably climbed past $500
billion, up from $368 billion at the end of 1987. However, the
government will not release the official calculation of that figure
until June 29.
   As recently as 1981, the United States ran surpluses in its
current account because the nation's cushion in overseas investment
earnings was enough to offset perennial merchandise trade deficits.
   But in 1985, the United States became a net debtor for the first
time in 71 years as the value of American investments overseas were
surpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the United States.
That reflected the fact that billions of dollars had been
transferred into foreign hands to pay for foreign cars and
television sets and other imported goods.
   Today's report said that in addition to the $27.63 billion
deficit in merchandise trade and the $369 million surplus in the
services category, the $30.69 billion current account deficit
reflected payments of $3.42 billion in foreign aid and pensions to
Americans living overseas.
   In other government reports on the economy today:
   _Regulatory agencies reported that the nation's 2,938 savings and
loan institutions amassed net losses of $3.4 billion in the first
quarter of the year, while the 13,001 commercial U.S. banks were
enjoying record profits totaling $7.3 billion. For all of 1988, S&amp;Ls
toted up $13 billion in losses and banks posted a record $25.1
billion in profits.
   _Retail sales rose a sluggish 0.1 percent in May, held down by a
decline in department store sales and a slowdown in activity at
automobile dealership, the Commerce Department said. Sales climbed

<HEAD>Thornburg: Third Of Major Thrift Fraud Cases Languishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third of all major bank fraud cases are not being
pursued because the Justice Department lacks resources, Attorney
General Dick Thornburg said today.
   Thornburg told the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force a recent survey
indicates 8,343 bank fraud related matters and cases pending in
various U.S. Attorney's of FBI offices, with 4,000 classified as
``major bank fraud.''
   ``Over 2,300 of the pending cases were inactive for lack of
adequate investigatory resources or prosecutorial resources, and
1,332 of those were classified as major bank fraud,'' he said.
   Thornburg urged passage of the Bush Administration's thrift
bailout bill, which includes $50 million to investigate major thrift
industry fraud.
   He said the added money would allow the Justice Department to
double its bank fraud investigations, adding 200 FBI agents and 100
prosecutors and other personnel.
   The attorney general estimated that between 25 percent to 30
percent of the industry's losses are attributable to fraud.
   The Dallas task force is an inter-agency effort to prosecute
malfeasance in the thrift and banking industry. It has come under
some criticism for failed prosecutions.

   Hundreds of miners today defied a
back-to-work order and joined thousands of fellow United Mine
Workers across West Virginia in the second day of a sympathy strike.
   The miners walked out Monday in a show of support for 1,600 UMW
members on strike against Pittston Coal Group in Virginia and West
Virginia since April.
   ``They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-union
mines by the end of next week,'' said Dave Evans, a striking
Pittston miner. ``You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _
whatever it takes to get this settled.''
   An industry official today said the walkout appeared to be
confined to southern West Virginia's UMW District 17 _ the union's
largest, with 8,000 members.
   Consolidation Coal Co. said 250 of its 4,000 employees stayed off
the job today despite a back-to-work order issued by a federal judge
on Monday. The company had argued that its workers were barred by
contract from striking.
   ``As of this morning the court order has been ignored,'' said
Consolidated spokesman Paul Kvederis. He had no other word on what
the company planned to do.
   Top union leaders did not immediately return calls today. UMW
leaders have insisted the strike was spontaneous and not sanctioned
by the union.
   Under their 1988 contract, the miners can take a 10-day
``memorial period'' and walk off the job to air grievances, but they
must give notice beforehand. None of the coal companies struck
Monday said they were informed.
   The president of the West Virginia Coal Association estimated
10,000 miners refused to show up for work Monday.
   The number of mines or mining companies affected by the walkout
was not immediately available.
   Monay's wildcat action was in support of the 2-month-old walkout
UMW against Pittston. Many miners say a Pittston victory might set a
precedent that could reverse gains made by unions early this century.
   The Pittston miners have been working without a contract for 14
months. They went on strike over wages, benefits and working
conditions.
   Over the course of the Pittston walkout, more than 2,200 miners,
retirees and their spouses have been arrested for civil disobedience
such as blocking coal trucks.
   A state judge in Virginia has jailed three union leaders and
fined the union $3 million for disobeying an order limiting pickets
at Pittston.
   ``Whatever it's gonna take to get the court systems to drop the
fines and get our fellas out of jail in Virginia, that's how long
it'll last,'' said Perry Harvey, a UMW field representative in Logan.

   Fears of another round of interest rate hikes in
Britain drove stock prices sharply lower Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 15.3
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,123.0, after slumping as much as 22.1
points at midday. At its best, the index was up 1.0 point at the
opening.
   Volume was a moderate 463.8 million shares, up from Monday's
381.8 million shares.
   The market moved lower as sterling dropped, raising fears of
higher interest rates.
   But sterling and stock prices recoverd somewhat when it became
clear the Bank of England was going to use repeated intervention
rather than an interest rate hike to support the pound for now,
dealers said.
   Dealers said the market wasn't likely to relax its guard in case
a British rate hike does materialize.
   Some players speculated that British authorities might be waiting
until after this week's European Parliament elections before taking
such an unpopular step as increasing interest rates.

   A federal judge has denied requests from
three states for jurisdiction over Maxicare Health Plans Inc.
bankruptcy proceedings.
   U.S. District Judge John J. Wilson issued orders Monday allowing
the health maintenance organization's subsidiaries to operate under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Arizona, Louisiana and Texas.
   The ruling was a small victory for Los Angeles-based Maxicare,
which is seeking to preserve as much as possible of its former
nationwide health care network since it filed for bankruptcy
protection March 16.
   State regulators had said they had the expertise to rehabilitate
the HMOs. But state control of the bankruptcy proceedings left open
the possibility states would liquidate the units to pay Maxicare's
claims.
   Maxicare cited a backlog of past-due debts to providers among the
reasons for seeking protection from creditors.
   Other states that have sought jurisdiction in the case include
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The orders given to attorneys Monday did
not include motions filed from those states.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says She Supports Chancellor of Exchequer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday she
fully supports Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson as she moved
to dispel reports of a split over monetary policy.
   In answer to questions in the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher
said: ``I give full, unequivocal and generous backing to my
chancellor, of whom I am very proud.''
   The comments followed speculation she and Lawson are at odds over
whether the British currency should join the exchange rate mechanism
of the European monetary system.
   Mrs. Thatcher has said joining the mechanism could damage the
government's anti-inflation battle while Lawson has said it would
help buttress monetary policies to bring inflation down.
   However, Lawson on Monday also indicated he didn't see sterling
joining the mechanism until 1990 at the earliest.
   Thatcher also said she agreed with Lawson that the government's
overriding objective is to reduce inflation.
   The Conservative government has come under criticism for its
handling of the economy. Britain's inflation rate has more than
doubled to 8 percent in a year while the trade deficit has ballooned.
   In an effort to fight inflation, the government has pushed up
interest rates to 14 percent from a decade low of 7.5 percent last
summer.

   The dollar was mixed in busy European trading
Tuesday after two reported rounds of intervention by the U.S.
Federal Reserve. Gold prices dipped.
   The British pound finished at its lowest level against the dollar
in more than two years.
   But the pound ended above its session lows, as selling pressure
cooled after at least three rounds of intervention by the Bank of
England to support the British currency, dealers said.
   The pound also was helped by comments by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher aimed at quieting the market jitters over speculation of a
rift between her and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in the House of Commons, ``I give full,
unequivocal and generous backing to my chancellor, of whom I am very
proud.''
   The dollar began the European day on weak following rumors of
intervention by the Bank of Japan during the Tokyo day. But buying
interest re-emerged, pushing the dollar higher in Europe.
   Then two reported rounds of intervention by the Fed, which was
joined by the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, took the
dollar off its peaks, dealers said.
   In London, it cost $1.5162 to buy one pound late Tuesday. That
was the pound's lowest rate against the dollar since February 1987.
Late Monday, it cost $1.5250.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
2.0260 West German marks, up from 2.0250; 1.7520 Swiss francs, down
from 1.7550; 6.8675 French francs, up from 6.8620; 2.2758 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.2835; 1,459.25 Italian lire, down from
1,463.50; 1.2007 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2024.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 149.15 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $359.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $359.95.
   In Zurich, gold fell to close at a bid $358.75 compared with
$359.00 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.63 to close at a bid $361.66.
   Silver bullion prices held steady on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $5.20 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Monday.

<HEAD>`Clean Fuels' Expected To Get Boost From Bush Anti-Smog Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's call for Detroit to build
alternatives to gasoline-powered cars is expected to propel the
fledgling ``clean fuels'' move into overdrive.
   One of the main beneficiaries may be the natural gas industry. It
is heavily promoting the idea of running cars on compressed natural
gas, which emits less of some pollutants than vehicles burning
gasoline or diesel fuel.
   Natural gas also is a raw material for methanol, the Bush
administration's favored choice for an alternative to gasoline. Oil
companies, however, are critical of the methanol move, which they
say presents many cost and safety problems.
   Yet another alternative fuel is ethanol, made from fermented corn
and agricultural wastes. It is limited in supply and more expensive
than methanol or gasoline.
   Bush was seeking to drum up public support for alternative fuels
Tuesday with appearances in Nebraska, a big corn producer that last
year used more ethanol-based fuel, as a share of its total vehicle
fuels market, than any other state.
   The aim of the Bush proposal, announced Monday as part of a
broader environmental package, is to reduce vehicles' contribution
to air pollution. But it also would mean higher prices for
consumers, if gasoline is gradually eliminated, analysts said.
   Gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone
that causes smog.
   A key element of the Bush plan is a phased-in requirement for
auto manufacturers to produce alternatives to gasoline-powered autos
in the nine major urban areas with the worst smog problems.
   Half a million such cars would have to be available by 1995, and
1 million would have to be produced each year from 1997 through
2004. The urban areas are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Milwaukee,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego, Chicago and ``greater
Connecticut.''
   ``It'll be a big boost'' for alternative fuel use, said Scott
Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, an
environmental group that favors reducing use of fossil fuels, mainly
by improving energy and vehicle efficiency.
   The technology exists to produce cars capable of running on
alternative fuels. The auto companies have hesitated to undertake
full-scale production because of a concern that the fuels are not
yet widely available, while the oil companies balk at producing
large quantities of the fuels until the vehicles win consumer
acceptance.
   William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, told reporters the auto and oil industries must find a way
of resolving this stalemate.
   ``The point of this program...is to make sure that we solve the
chicken-and-egg problem, that we have the fuel available to service
the cars and the cars available to use the fuel,'' he said, adding
that industry must ``ensure that that happens.''
   The oil industry strongly criticized the alternative fuels
portion of Bush's proposal, which will be sent to Capitol Hill in
coming weeks. The industry wants a pilot program, at least partly
financed by the government, to work out the technical and economic
kinks before commercial-scale production is required.
   ``We are disappointed by the administration's apparent preference
for mandating alternate-fuel vehicles, an extremely costly and
inflexible step which would provide highly uncertain environmental
benefits and presumably require...higher prices for all fuels,''
said the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's main
lobbying group.
   The oil companies, which sell about 100 billion gallons of
gasoline a year, are quick to point out the drawbacks to alternative
fuels. Methanol, for example, emits less carbon monoxide than
gasoline but produces formaldehyde and other harmful poisons.
   Methanol is highly corrosive, so a car's fuel tank and the entire
fuel-delivery system must be made of a corrosion-resistant material
such as stainless steel.
   Engines running on compressed natural gas produce almost no soot
and less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons than
gasoline engines do. But some experts worry that greatly increased
use of natural gas would deplete the existing surpluses and could
lead to greater reliance on Middle Eastern energy suppliers.

   The Big Three automakers said Tuesday back-seat
lap and shoulder belts already are in place for many 1989 models and
will be in all required 1990 models.
   None of the companies would say how much the additional safety
measure, ordered Monday by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration for all 1990 hardtop cars, will cost consumers.
   The Center for Auto Safety in Washington estimated that kits for
installation of the belts in existing cars cost $200 and up.
   ``We've seen a transition from two decades ago from a period of
little or no public acceptance in safety devices to an era where
safety is perceived as a plus in most cases and the price of entry
in all others,'' said Bill Day, a Ford Motor Co. spokesman in
Washington.
   Ford offers standard rear lap and shoulder belts on 34 percent of
its 1989 cars, including the Taurus and Cougar.
   General Motors Corp. has offeed rear lap and shoulder belts since
1987. They are standard in all but two 1989 GM models, the full size
Chevrolet Blazer and the Geo Spectrum.
   ``We were well ahead of the rule,'' GM spokeswoman Antonette
Simonetti said.
   She said GM offers kits allowing installation of the rear
shoulder belts, but she could not say how popular they are.
   James Kenyon, a Chrysler Corp. spokesman, said several Chrysler
models have the rear belts for 1989, including the Dodge
Shadow-Plymouth Sundance series and the Eagle Summit.
   ``There is going to have to be some redesign work to accommodate
this ruling, but we are looking to have rear shoulder belts for the
1990s,'' Kenyon said.
   He added that a retroactive installation kit from Chrysler will
be available in August.
   Debra Barclay, a spokeswoman for the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, said the agency has criticized GM for declining to offer
kits for several models between 1978 and 1988.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part
of the Department of Transportation, told the center GM was within
its rights not to offer retroactive rear belt kits for some models.
   Barclay said anchors for permit installation of rear belts have
been on all U.S. cars since 1972.
   She said consumer awareness of the availability of rear belt kits
is limited. Many dealers, she said, are reluctant to offer them
because of possible liability in case they don't protect a back seat
passenger in an accident.
   The prices of the kits often are inflated by dealerships, she
said.
   Simonetti said GM's retroactive belt kits cost $50 to $60.
Barclay said kits for older models begin in the $200 range and cost
up to $300 for newer models.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported by a bullish
Agriculture Department crop report and expectations for drier
weather in the Corn Belt.
   In a report issued after the close of trading Monday, the USDA
peggged the drought-damaged winter wheat crop at an 11-year-low of
1.41 billion bushels, down 10 percent from last year's harvest and 2
percent below the May forecast.
   The report gave a boost to the wheat market, but buying
enthusiasm was tempered by forecasts for drier-than-normal
conditions early next week in the Great Plains, which would
accelerate the winter wheat harvest.
   The soybean market regained nearly all of the ground it lost
Monday amid talk of warm, dry weather forecast for the Midwest late
this week and through the weekend. Those predictions also supported
the corn market.
   But some analysts said the strong soybean rally was inspired more
by technical factors than weather forecasts.
   ``I think the market was a little oversold going into today's
session after the last couple sessions' losses,'' said Mark Weidner,
a soybean market analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.92\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.53 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to

<HEAD>President Says Debt Talks With Banks May Take Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said
Tuesday that renegotiation of Mexico's debt with private banks may
take months to complete.
   As late as last week there was informed speculation that so much
progress was being made in the negotiations that a final agreement
could be reached in two to three weeks.
   But in an interview with executives and members of The Associated
Press, Salinas said ``there are still weeks, maybe months ahead in
the negotiations.''
   He said the talks with private banks are the toughest part of the
debt renegotiation. ``Banks look at their balance sheets and we have
to respond to social pressures,'' he said.
   Some 500 commercial banks hold about $74 billion of Mexico's
$107.4 billion total foreign debt, which is the second-largest in
the developing world after Brazil.
   Mexico is attempting to renegotiate its bank agreements to cut
its payment burden and help revive its economy.
   Salinas said Mexico must cut its debt service from 7 percent to 2
percent of gross domestic product to revive the long-stagnant
economy.
   The president also reiterated his objections that debt-for-equity
swaps _ where lenders exchange outstanding debts for equity in local
enterprises _ generate inflation and damage the economy.
   He said Mexico wants additional foreign investment and would
welcome foreign capital in infrastructure projects including
telecommunications, dams and roads.
   The Salinas administration is trying to encourage foreign
investment by cutting red tape and opening up new sectors of the
economy to foreign capital.
   Salinas said he is pleased the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank are supporting Mexico's efforts to restructure its
foreign debt.
   He said he is ``confident we will arrive at a satisfactory
solution'' with the private lenders, ``but it will still take some
time.''
   The Bank of Mexico has not released any figures on foreign
reserves since the end of 1988 but they are believed to be low. Some
experts say they will not cover the debt payments coming due in the
next few months.
   ``There is not much time,'' Salinas said.
   The social pressures on the seven-month-old Salinas
administration are intense. The president said real wages in Mexico
had dropped 50 percent since 1982 and a solution to the debt problem
was needed to prevent social unrest.
   When asked about the use of debt-for-equity swaps, Salinas said
they lead to ``increasing liquidity in the economy and cause
pressure on prices'' leading to greater inflation and the need for
increasing government subsidies.
   ``Inflation is worse than stagnation,'' he said.
   Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, devised Mexico's
successful anti-inflation program while serving as budget minister
to his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid.
   While stressing the need for economic growth, Salinas said
``growth by itself will not be enough.'' Mexico needs ``clean
growth'' which respects the environment, he said.
   Mexico City and the country's other major industrial centers are
considered to be among the world's most polluted cities.

<HEAD>EEC Banking Law Soon To Be Adopted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community will
soon adopt a single license for banks operating in the 12-nation
trading bloc, the European commissioner for financial services said
Tuesday.
   ``We have made enormous progress in the last few days,'' Sir Leon
Brittan said in a briefing with reporters.
   Brittan said he expects the regulations, which would allow EC
banks to operate across their borders, to pass within a month.
   But the licensing proposal has raised controversy because of its
so-called reciprocity clause.
   Some EC members worried that foreign banks might be excluded from
operating in the Community unless EEC banks were given equivalent
advantages abroad.
   Sir Leon amended the proposal earlier this year. Under the
changes, the EEC would open negotiations with countries whose
banking regimes were less liberal than its own but wouldn't
systematically suspend an application by a foreign bank while it
reviews access to the foreign bank's home country.

<HEAD>Two Fined $175,000 for Improper Trades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Tuesday it
has fined two traders a total of $175,000 for making improper trades
of stock-index futures during the week of the 1987 stock-market
crash.
   The exchange said Michael P. Walsh and Paul F. Carbonaro
pre-arranged six separate trades of Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock-index futures contracts from Oct. 16 through Oct. 22, 1987.
   The trades involved a total of 94 contracts for future deliveries
of the stocks tracked by the closely watched S&amp;P 500 index.
   Walsh, president of the Spike Trading Co., was fined $75,000 and
suspended from trading for 20 business days beginning Tuesday.
   Carbonaro, a floor broker, was fined $100,000 and suspended from
trading for 30 business days beginning Friday.
   A receptionist at Spike Trading said Walsh was not in. A clerk
for Carbonaro said he was too busy to come to the telephone.
   The penalties follow months of questioning by Congress about the
futures industry's ability to regulate itself. Scrutiny of the
industry has intensified since the revelation in January that an FBI
investigation of futures trading in Chicago was under way.
   The Merc's compliance department reportedly began investigating
Walsh shortly after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock-market crash.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that an internal
department memo dated Nov. 9, 1987, indicated the exchange launched
an investigation because ``during the period October 19-23, 1987,
Walsh made over $2.5 million'' trading stock-index futures.
   Stock-index futures trading has been singled out as a factor that
may have accelerated the stock market's collapse, although futures
exchanges have disputed that notion.
   Walsh was fined $1,500 last November for unbusiness-like conduct
in the trading pit. He was fined $1,000 in 1984 for ``use of undue
force'' while entering or leaving the stock-index futures pit.

<HEAD>Jobs Lands Another Coup With Cannon $100 Million Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Jobs pulled off another coup when he
landed a $100 million investment for his tiny company, Next Inc.,
from giant Japanese electronics firm Canon Inc., analysts said
Tuesday.
   ``I definitely think that it's an excellent deal for Next,'' said
Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. of San
Francisco. ``It's an extraordinary valuation that's being paid.''
   Canon, a manufacturer of camera and office equipment, invested
$100 million for a 16.67 percent stake in Next, pushing the market
value for the 4-year-old Palo Alto company to about $600 million.
   The Canon payment, announced Monday, is considered extremely high
for a company that still is not shipping its first product in
significant volume, something that worried some analysts.
   ``We have to see how good Next is; it's not clear that they have
the winning product,'' said David Wu, an analyst with S.G. Warburg
of New York.
   The deal includes a separate agreement under which Canon will
become the exclusive distributor of Next computer workstations in
Japan and eight other Asian countries, and follows another Jobs coup
in March whereby Businessland Inc. of San Jose said it would
distribute Next's computers to businesses.
   ``Obviously, Businessland and Canon are betting that Next will
deliver the product,'' said Laura Lederman, an analyst with Duff &amp;
Phelps of Chicago. ``They're betting that that product will perform
to expectations _ and they're betting on Steve Jobs.''
   Jobs, 34, who co-founded Apple Computer but left following a
power struggle in 1985, first displayed Next's sleek black
workstation in October, when he offered it for sale to colleges and
universities beginning at $10,000.
   He abruptly switched marketing tactics when he decided to include
sales to businesses in the deal with Businessland, a leading
computer retailer with 112 outlets nationwide.
   The market for workstations _ high-powered desktop computers _ is
expected to grow at a 30 percent clip through 1993 for total
revenues of about $18 billion, according to Dataquest Inc., the San
Jose, Calif., research firm.
   Hewlett-Packard's recent acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. made
it the No. 1 player in the workstation market, followed by Sun
Microsystems, according to Dataquest. Other major players in the
workstation market, besides Next, include Digital Equipment Corp.
and Apple Computer Inc.
   Analysts said the Canon deal was impressive because Next did not
give Cannon any technology or manufacturing rights, and the
additional cash will allow Next to complete its manufacturing
facility and begin full production of its computer.
   Canon cannot expand its stake in Next beyond 20 percent for the
next 10 years. Only Jobs, with 50 percent, and Next employees, with
20 percent, have a bigger ownership in the company. Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot owns 12.5 percent of Next.
   Hiroshi Tanaka, senior managing director of Tokyo-based Canon,
said Monday that his company made the investment because ``we feel
that Next will be the most important Unix workstation company
worldwide, and that it is in our mutual interest to do all we can to
strengthen our long-term relationship.''

<HEAD>Direct Dialing To Moscow Resumes This Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Callers in the United States will be able to dial
Moscow directly this fall for the first time since 1982 under an
agreement with the Soviet government, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. said Tuesday.
   Direct-dial service will make it easier to phone Moscow and will
improve transmissions from facsimile machines and computers, AT&amp;T
said.
   Direct dialing was permitted from July to October of 1980,
suspended and then resumed from March 1981 to September 1982.
   ``I suppose it mirrors the rise and fall of relationships with
the Soviet Union,'' AT&amp;T spokesman Rick Wallerstein said.
   MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance carrier, is
negotiating with the Soviets and expects to provide direct-dialing
to Moscow and possibly other cities over non-AT&amp;T circuits by the
end of the year, spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said.
   US Sprint Communications Co., the No. 3 carrier, expects to offer
direct dialing by buying room on AT&amp;T circuits, spokeswoman Terri
Dunn said.
   The number of circuits between the United States and Soviet Union
will increase as part of AT&amp;T's agreement, making it easier for
calls to go through.
   The exact date for resumption of direct dialing to Moscow has not
been set, AT&amp;T said. Direct dialing is usually cheaper, but
Wallerstein said he could not comment on the price before AT&amp;T made
a rate filing.
   Calls to other parts of the Soviet Union will continue to require
an operator, although AT&amp;T is discussing expansion of direct dialing
to more cities with the Soviet Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications. Direct dialing was available for part of 1981 to
Kiev, Leningrad, Tallinn and Minsk.
   AT&amp;T has provided telephone service to the Soviet Union since
1943.
   The only countries to which AT&amp;T provides no phone service are
Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea and Albania, Wallerstein said.

   Pratt &amp; Whitney on Tuesday announced
$450 million in jet engine orders from Korean Air and four European
airlines _ Alitalia, France's Air Liberte and Minerve, and Transwede
of Sweden.
   Alitalia ordered 50 JT8D-200 jet engines for 25 McDonnell Douglas
MD-80 passenger planes with an option to double the order. The total
value of the options and orders is $330 million.
   Ten of the new Alitalia orders were conversions of earlier
options.
   Korean Air ordered 12 PW4158 engines, Pratt &amp; Whitney's most
fuel-efficient engine, to power six Airbus twinjets. The order is
worth $65 million.
   The other three European airlines placed orders or options for 20
engines valued at $55 million.
   Air Liberte ordered four engines for two MD-83 planes to be
delivered in March 1991, and Minerve, a French charter airline, took
options for four engines for the same model for delivery in 1994.
   Transwede of Sweden ordered four engines for two MD-83s and took
options on eight more engines. Those planes are to be delivered in
1991 and 1992.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp., on
Monday announced an order from Air Outre Mer of France for engines
potentially worth $268 million.
   Those engines would be used to power McDonnell Douglas MD-11
trijets. The French airline has ordered four MD-11s and has options
to buy four more.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney initially will supply 12 PW4000 engines worth
$130 million with another 12 to be purchased in Air Outre buys the
additional MD-11s. Air Outre is expected to begin receiving the jets
in 1994.
   International Aero Engines, also of East Hartford, received an
order for six engines potentially worth $85 million.
   LaTur, a Mexican airline, ordered four of the company's V2500
engines and placed options for two more. The engines will power A320
aircraft ordered by La Tur, which are to be received in 1992.

   Executives of big American companies predict
China will become a more attractive market despite the bloody
crackdown on dissenters this month, a poll released Tuesday said.
   The Fortune 500-CNN Moneyline CEO Poll of 183 chief executives
was conducted from May 30 to June 7, bridging the days in which
troops cleared Beijing's Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifles.
   Of the 116 executives surveyed before the crackdown, 55 percent
thought China would become a more attractive market, 5 percent
thought it would become less attractive, 23 percent thought there
would be no change and 17 percent said they were not sure.
   Of the 67 interviewed afterward, 53 percent thought China would
become more attractive, 17 percent said less attractive, 9 percent
said no change and 21 percent said they were not sure.
   Because of the small size of the samples, the margins of error
are higher than in most surveys. Fortune spokesman Gary Belis said
he could not say exactly what the error margins were.
   ``The conflict hasn't changed my fundamental thinking. It's a
temporary blot that highlights how fragile building new
relationships can be,'' William Esrey, the chief of United
Telecommunications Inc., the phone company, said in an interview
published in the July 3 issue of Fortune magazine.
   Asked about the Soviet Union, 89 percent of the executives
predicted the country would become a more attractive market, none
said it would become less attractive, 10 percent said there would be
no change and 1 percent said they were not sure.

   President Bush today vetoed
legislation raising the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour, setting up a
political battle with the Democratic majority in Congress.
   ``This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' Bush
said in a veto message that ran more than 1,500 words.
   ``It would damage the employment prospects of our young people
and least advantaged citizens,'' he said. ``It would accelerate
inflation. It would not help those in poverty. And thus it would
fail to properly reflect the thought behind this measure: to help
our lowest paid workers.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the House would attempt to
override the veto on Thursday and that he would work through the
night trying to sway Democrats who voted against the measure when it
cleared the House earlier this year.
   ``Hope springs eternal,'' was all Foley would say when asked if
he had any evidence that he could swing the 30 or so votes Democrats
would need to pick up in the House in order to override a veto.
   In the unlikely event the House voted to override, it still
appears that Bush would emerge victorious. Thirty-five GOP senators
have signed a letter pledging to support Bush on a veto fight.
   Foley and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Democrats
would quickly advance another minimum wage bill if Bush prevails in
the veto fight.
   Bush said that if Congress is unwilling to accept his approach
toward raising the minimum wage, he would examine the possibility of
raising the Earned Income Tax Credit to help the working poor.
   The credit, a portion of which is available for families with
incomes up to $18,576, is aimed at offsetting part of Social
Security taxes paid by the working poor. It can be worth up to $874
a year. A family can gain the full benefit even if its tax liability
is less than the credit.
   Bush had said in advance that he would veto the legislation, and
he wasted no time doing so.
   The bill was received at the White House at 1 p.m. EDT, and Bush
signed the veto message just 55 minutes later, aboard Air Force One
en route from Wyoming to Lincoln, Neb.
   The bill sent to the White House called for a $4.55 hourly
minimum wage by October 1991 while Bush offered to go to $4.25 in
January 1992.
   The administration and Congress also differ over whether
employers should be able to pay newly hired workers a subminimum
wage during a training period. Bush has said such a provision is
vital to prevent massive job losses and proposed that employers be
allowed to pay a subminimum wage to all new workers for up to six
months regardless of prior work experience.
   Democrats initially resisted any such provision but included in
their final bill a clause allowing a subminimum to be paid to
workers with less than two month's work experience.
   ``I wish to be clear about this,'' Bush said in his veto message.
``My difference with the Congress is not just about 30 cents an
hour. It is about hundreds of thousands of jobs that would be
preserved by my administration's approach as opposed to those that
would be sacrificed under the excessive increase included in this
legislation.''
   White House aides have been preparing for the veto. Chief of
staff John Sununu told reporters earlier today in Wyoming that the
measure will ``come to the White House, hit the wall and bounce back
like a rubber ball.''
   Sununu said with a laugh, ``This may be the first faxed veto in
history.''
   It was an apparent reference to the legislation being sent via
fax machine from the Capitol to the White House.
   Democratic leaders were caught off guard by the swiftness of the
veto. They had called a news conference to ask Bush one last time
not to veto the measure and two had printed statements urging Bush
to reconsider.
   ``I deeply regret that the president has chosen to veto this
bill, so important I think to the millions and millions of working
men and women in the United States who deserve a living wage,''
Foley told reporters.
   Added Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell: ``It is
particularly offensive to millions of poor working Americans that
President Bush would veto a bill over 30 cents an hour at the same
time that he is pushing hard to give a $30,000 a year tax cut to the
very richest Americans.''

   The stock market finished broadly lower today
amid concerns that a robust dollar could undermine corporate profits.
   A weakening in bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in
stocks and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on
which they had made substantial profits in recent weeks.
   Also motivating sellers was a desire to make certain profits
before the government reports a string of potentially market-moving
economic statistics later this week.
   Among the reports scheduled for release are ones on April
merchandise trade and May industrial production on Thursday and May
consumer prices and housing starts on Friday.
   Wall Street analysts expressed worries about the adverse impact a
high-flying dollar might have on earnings of export-oriented and
multinational companies. These concerns surfaced despite a pullback
in the dollar today.
   Previously, investors had been concentrating on the benefits a
strong dollar could bestow on the stock market by drawing in foreign
money.
   Waves of program selling temporarly hit the market when stock
index futures contracts dropped, encouraging arbitragers to buy
futures and sell stocks. The impact was limited, however, and share
prices managed to bob back up a bit from the lowest levels of the
session.

<HEAD>Export Quota Cut Triggered by Slump in Coffee Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Coffee Organization cut export
quotas for some producers Tuesday after talks aimed at extending the
present price-support pact collapsed and prices crashed.
   The reduction was automatically triggered by a fall in the
organization's indicator price of coffee below $1.15 a pound.
   The price is the absolute floor the 74-nation body seeks to
defend by its price-support regime of export quotas, which expires
Sept. 30. The coffee organization indicator price Tuesday was
$1.1463.
   The organization cut the quota by 350,700 bags, which reduces the
global quota allocation for the year October 1988 to September 1989
to 56.87 million bags. One bag equals 132 pounds.
   It was the third cut in quotas this year and, like the others,
affects only producers of the poorer robusta bean. The main burden
falls on the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Indonesia.
   The selective application of quota cuts reflects the coffee
organization's aim in the 1988-89 year to boost supplies of
top-quality arabica produced throughout Latin America.
   But quotas of producers of this type will be cut if the price of
the grade drops below $1.30 a pound from its present level of $1.39,
the organization said.
   Negotiations between producing and consuming nations on a
one-year extension of the pact allowing prices to be stabilized by
supply controls collapsed in confusion early Tuesday.
   Brazil, Colombia, all African producers, the Philippines and the
European Economic Community backed a proposal at the nine-day talks
to extend the pact from Oct. 1, leaving details, such as shares of
the global export quota, to be worked out before then.
   The move was opposed by the 11-nation group of producers of the
top-quality and increasingly popular mild arabica coffee, including
Mexico, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador
and India.
   They proposed that an extension should be conditional on an
agreement now that they would receive a bigger slice of the export
quota market than at present. The United States, the biggest coffee
consuming nation, supported the proposal.
   The nations agreed to hold a one-day session here July 3 to vote
on the two proposals, delegates said. Unless many nations change
position, both proposals are expected to be rejected, they said.
   In that event, the coffee organization is expected to extend the
present pact without its powers to regulate supplies and prices,
said the head of the West German delegation, Hugo Roerig.
   Traders fear that producing countries will ignore coffee
organization sales limits before Oct. 1 if no export quotas are
adopted.
   Analysts said there are ample world supplies of coffee beans
despite two consecutive poor Brazilian crops. Huge stocks of coffee
are also believed to be held in European warehouses.

<HEAD>Gaming Giant to Build Plant in Las Vegas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp., which owns gaming
properties in Nevada and New Jersey, announced plans Tuesday to
build an estimated $10 million gaming equipment plant in Las Vegas.
   The plant will manufacture gaming machines and lottery terminals.
Completion of the 150,000-square-foot facility at the Huges Airport
Center near McCarran International Airport is scheduled by mid-1990.
   The plant initially will provide jobs for up to 300 people.
   ``It makes sense to be a gaming manufacturer in a gaming state,''
said Bally President Roger Keesee.
   Keesee said rail and air transportation were added factors in
selecting the Las Vegas site.
   Bally is a $2 billion company that designs, makes and markets
leisure and recreation products. Chicago-based Bally operates casino
hotels in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and has two properties in
Atlantic City, N.J.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the 11 authors hired by Whittle
Communications to write brief hardcover books that will contain
advertising said Tuesday he has withdrawn from the project because
of editorial interference.
   Edward Jay Epstein had been signed to write a book about Michael
Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive who was a
pioneer in developing the junk bond market.
   The book was one of several that Whittle plans to publish in what
it is tentatively calling its ``Larger Agenda'' series for
distribution to government and corporate leaders. The books will run
about 100 pages each and be sponsored by a single company which
Whittle has refused to identify.
   However, Federal Express Corp. of Memphis has confirmed it
intends to be a sponsor of the books.
   Epstein recently submitted an outline of his book, but said
Whittle editor Anthony Kiser expressed concern about whether
Whittle's audience would like the line of argument he was advancing.
   The author said he ``didn't feel comfortable with the kinds of
editorial suggestions being made by the editorial director there.''
He declined to go into what was being suggested and said he had no
way of knowing the reasons for demanding the changes.
   But Epstein said he had never run into such problems in writing
11 other books with six different publishing companies in which no
advertiser was involved in the project.
   William Rukeyser, editor-in-chief at Whittle Communications, said
the advertiser had nothing to do with suggestions about Epstein's
book outline.
   ``It was entirely an editorial process,'' said Rukeyser, a former
managing editor at Fortune magazine, adding he was ``outraged''
anyone would suggest an advertiser was interfering.
   ``He seemed to be proposing a book that would take the view that
Michael Milken's overall effect on the economy has been so healthy,
the fact that he may have committed felonies didn't matter. We felt
that was not an intellectually or morally viable stance for the book
to to take,'' he said.
   Milken has been indicted on federal securities fraud charges and
could face a trial next year.
   Federal Express spokeaman Armand Schneider said from Memphis that
the company has ``no editorial control over the books.''
   ``The content is up to Whittle. We know the names of the authors
and the working titles, but that's all,'' he said.
   Rukeyser said he did not think Epstein's withdrawal from the
project would affect Whittle's broader plans for single-advertiser
books.
   Whittle disclosed earlier this year it signed book contracts with
nine authors including Epstein, John Kenneth Galbraith and David
Halberstam.
   The New York Times, which disclosed Epstein's withdrawal from the
project in Tuesday's editions, said Halberstam and another project
author, James Atlas, told the newspaper they had not experienced any
interference in their books.
   Rukeyser said two more authors he declined to identify have since
been signed. The first book could appear later this year with
additional books expected in 1990.

   Central banks helped push the dollar lower
Tuesday as the U.S. government reported the deficit in its broadest
measure of foreign trade worsened dramatically in early 1989.
   The trade deficit did not directly contribute to the weakness in
the dollar because the figures had been expected. But some
economists believe the huge gap in trade inevitably will halt the
dollar's early-summer rally.
   ``I don't believe this dollar rally can be sustained for more
than a few weeks, more than a month or two,'' said Charles Taylor,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Washington.
   Americans are buying far more from overseas than they sell to
foreign customers. That can continue only while foreigners are
willing to pile up credits in the form of loans and investments in
the United States.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account
jumped 7 percent in the first quarter after falling the two previous
quarters. The current account covers merchandise trade as well as
trade in services, primarily investment income.
   The dollar fell against all major currencies except the British
pound, which was weakened by speculation of a rift between Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her top economic official, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   The pound finished the European trading day at its lowest level
against the dollar in more than two years, although action by the
Bank of England and a statement by Mrs. Thatcher supporting Lawson
raised it from its lowest levels.
   There were reports of dollar sales by the Bank of Japan, Bank of
England, Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve. The Fed intervened
five times, according to Jack Adkins, a currency analyst at Refco
Group Ltd. in Chicago.
   In London, the pound slipped to $1.5162 late Tuesday. That was
the pound's lowest rate against the dollar since February 1987. Late
Monday, sterling cost $1.5250. In New York, the pound traded at
$1.5270, down from $1.5285 on Monday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 149.15 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to
147.75 yen from 148.46 yen on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 2.0140 West German marks, down from 2.0195; 1.7385
Swiss francs, down from 1.7470; 1.1997 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2011; 6.8270 French francs, down from 6.8420; and 1,455.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,460.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 2.0260 West German marks, up from 2.0250; 1.7520
Swiss francs, down from 1.7550; 6.8675 French francs, up from
6.8620; 2.2758 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2835; 1,459.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,463.50; 1.2007 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2024.
   Gold prices rose in New York trading after having been mixed
abroad.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.63 a troy ounce to close at a bid of
$361.66.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $359.50 a troy ounce from
late Monday's $359.95. In Zurich, gold fell to a bid of $358.75 from
$359.00 Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $363.10 an ounce from $361.90 on Monday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$362.20 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $360.70 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices held steady in London, where the metal was
trading at a late bid of $5.20 a troy ounce, unchanged from late
Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
rose to $5.224 an ounce from $5.202 on Monday.

   The stock market moved broadly lower Tuesday,
depressed by concerns about the adverse consequences of a recently
robust dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished with a loss of
15.30 points at 2,503.54.
   In nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues,
losers swamped gainers by a margin of about 2 to 1, with 1,014 down,
503 up and 483 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.87 million
shares, up from 151.46 million in the previous session.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said a weakening in long-term Treasury bond prices acted as a
catalyst for the selloff in stocks and encouraged investors to prune
their holdings of shares on which they had made substantial profits
in recent weeks.
   Also motivating sellers Tuesday was a desire to collect their
profits before the government reports a string of potentially
market-moving economic statistics later this week.
   Reports on merchandise trade in April and industrial production
in May are due Thursday. On Friday, reports for May on consumer
prices and housing starts will be issued.
   Despite a pullback in the dollar Tuesday, Wall Street analysts
expressed worries that the dollar's recent strength against foreign
currencies could impair the profitability of many American companies
that rely on revenue from overseas sales. A strong dollar makes U.S.
exports more expensive on markets abroad.
   The pharmaceuticals concern Pfizer partly blamed the dollar's
appreciation for an expected 30 percent to 40 percent decline in its
second-quarter earnings. Disclosure of the disappointing estimate
late Monday led Pfizer stock to plunge 3[ to 58 in heavy trading
Tuesday.
   Other drug companies took a cue from Pfizer. Syntex slid 1{ to
50}, SmithKline Beckman fell 1[ to 61], Marion Laboratories shed }
to 25\, Warner Lambert tumbled 2] to 89 and Merck dropped 2[ to 68}
and contributed to the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Among other blue chips, International Business Machines jumped 2[
to 111 as more than 2 million shares changed hands on news that an
investment firm had confirmed its buy recommendation.
   Stocks confronting takeover situations continued to figure
prominently in the NYSE's lineup of actively traded issues.
   Time rose 5 to 180 as reports circulated that General Electric
might enter the bidding for the publishing giant. GE led the
actives' list, closing with a loss of }, at 53{.
   Time is fighting a hostile $175-per-share buyout bid from
Paramount Communications in an attempt to preserve a planned stock
swap merger with Warner Communications. Paramount rose } to 57} and
Warner closed off \ at 54\.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 193.36 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $21.19 billion, or 0.66
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.20 to 180.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index dropped 2.49 to 370.72, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished at 323.91, off 2.33.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
declined 2.66 to 450.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 364.27, down 1.62.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Plunge Continues on Failed ICO Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices dropped to a 10-month low Tuesday amid
fears the International Coffee Organization's failure to forge a new
price-support pact could leave unroasted coffee free to fall to as
low as $1 a pound.
   On other markets, orange juice futures rose sharply; grains and
soybeans advanced; petroleum futures were mixed; precious metals
gained; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled 4.75 cents to 9.46 cents lower on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery
in July at $1.1538, the lowest close since Aug. 8, 1988.
   The price of coffee for July delivery in New York has dropped
more than 11 percent since Friday.
   The loss of nearly 9{ cents Tuesday was nearly twice as large as
the decline posted Monday, when it became apparent the world's
largest coffee producer- and consumer-nations would end their
nine-day meeting in London without an agreement to replace the
six-year pact that expires on Oct. 1.
   ``This has to be seen as follow-through from yesterday's
selling,'' said Arthur Stevenson, a coffee-market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   The International Coffee Organization attempts to control coffee
prices by limiting exports of green, unroasted coffee from producer
members to consumer members of the 74-nation body.
   One of the major stumbling blocks in London was a demand by some
of the leading consumer nations, including the United States, for
tighter restrictions on sales of coffee to non-ICO member nations
such as the Soviet Union at prices below those charged to member
nations.
   Traders fear that without a price-support mechanism, coffee will
flood the market and prices will collapse.
   ``People are really talking up the $1 level,'' said Sandra Kaul,
a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst in New York.
   But she said the futures market may have overreacted to the
failed London meeting, noting that coffee inventories are relatively
low and that Brazil, the world's largest coffee is entering its
cold-weather season. A damaging freeze in Brazil could turn the
market around in a hurry.
   Representatives of the International Coffee Organization will
meet again July 3. No negotiations toward a new agreement are
expected at that meeting, but members could vote to extend the
current pact.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures rallied strongly on the
New York Cotton Exchange following five straight days of pronounced
weakness. Analysts called the runup a technical correction to an
oversold condition.
   Orange juice settled .75 cent to 6.95 cents higher with July at
$1.8025 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade,
supported by a bullish Agriculture Department crop report and
expectations for drier weather in the Corn Belt.
   Wheat settled } cent to 3} cents higher with July at $3.92\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.52{ a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $1.61{ a
bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 10 cents higher with July at $7.01
a bushel.
   Crude oil for July delivery advanced slightly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange but most other petroleum futures retreated amid
signs of discord among OPEC members.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 cents lower to 8
cents higher with July at $19.34 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent
to .87 cent lower with July at 44.58 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.81 cents lower to .22 cent higher with July at 59.92
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals inched higher on New York's Commodity Exchange,
where gold settled $1 to $1.90 higher with August at $366.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.5 cents higher with July at $5.25 a
troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were .23 cent
lower to .43 cent higher with June at 70.65 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .10 cent higher with August at 80.75 cents
a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June
at 47.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent lower to
.92 cent higher with July at 34.52 cents a pound.

   Kraft won't say what rocked its ``Ready to
Roll'' game, but the food giant may have to explain in court how
more than 100 people wound up with winning game pieces for a ``one
and only'' $17,000 grand prize.
   ``We've declared the game null and void. We're still evaluating
what our next step will be,'' Kathy Knuth, spokeswoman for Kraft
General Foods Group of Philip Morris, said Tuesday at the company's
suburban Chicago offices.
   ``We're telling people who've matched the pieces to go ahead and
mail them in, but we don't know what we'll do,'' she said.
``Obviously we feel very badly about the situation.''
   Apparently not as badly as some of Kraft's customers, who filed a
class-action lawsuit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court.
   A promotional insert in Sunday newspapers in the Chicago and
Houston areas carried the right half of four game pieces for ``Ready
to Roll.''
   Specially marked packages of Kraft cheese contained a left half,
and matched pairs could be redeemed for one of 8,000 free packages
of cheese; one of 500 skateboards; one of 100 bicycles; or, at odds
of 15 million-to-1, a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE.
   ``The problem is that instead of there being a limited number of
winners, almost all of the game pieces that went out with the cheese
had winning pieces of one kind r another,'' said Knuth. She would
not say who put the game together.
   Attorney Jay DeGroot, whose firm filed the lawsuit Tuesday,
declined to discuss it. His law firm filed a class-action lawsuit
three years ago when a mistake caused Beatrice Cos. to cancel a
promotion, and won a $2 million settlement for 2,400 players.
   ``I'd be willing to go to court, if only because I had to go into
the garbage can to get mine,'' said Larry Bernstein, a dissatisfied
customer who is not named in the lawsuit. He explained that his
7-year-old son, Richard, loves contests and his wife, Joyce, had
thrown out the game piece that came with the cheese to hide it from
Richard.
   ``But we were looking through the paper Sunday and she realized
she had the matching half. I called Kraft and by the time they
called me back, I was told hundreds of people claimed the same
thing,'' Bernstein said.
   Almost immediately, Kraft began recalling all the specially
marked packages from store shelves in both the Chicago and Houston
areas.
   Knuth declined to reveal any details about the promotion, other
than to say the company's position is that it cannot be held liable
for the error.
   ``It is so obviously unintentional,'' she said.
   But the Illinois attorney general's office already has heard from
50 angry customers, said spokeswoman Therese McMahon. And a private
attorney who already has been contacted by one winner says the
company ``may not be able to say, `Oops,' and forget about it.''
   ``In breach-of-contract matters like this, you can defend
yourself by saying the error was so obvious that the person who
benefits from it should know,'' said attorney James Magee. ``I'm not
sure that will wash in this instance, especially in front of a
jury.''
   Robert Blashek, executive vice president for Ventura Associates
International, a New York-based contest, sweepstakes and
game-planning service, rated the Kraft mixup ``pretty bad as these
things go.''
   ``But on the scale of foulups,'' he added, ``I've heard of worse.
The difference is that most of those don't reach the public.''

<HEAD>Gasoline, Heating Oil Futures Decline; Crude Prices Edge Upward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for gasoline and heating oil futures
slipped Tuesday, partly reflecting trader fear of an increase in
stockpiles of petroleum products.
   The fear turned out to be unfounded, however. After the close of
trading, the American Petroleum Institute reported stockpiles of
crude oil, gasoline and other refined products all fell in the week
ended Friday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline
for July delivery fell 1.81 cents a gallon to 59.92 cents after
sliding 1.99 cents on Monday. Wholesale home heating oil for July
delivery dropped 0.87 cent to 44.58 cents a gallon after a 1.58-cent
decline Monday.
   Crude oil for July delivery edged up 8 cents to $19.34 a barrel
after falling 62 cents on Monday. However, subsequent contract
months moved lower Tuesday.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said the downward momentum of Monday carried over into
Tuesday, partly over fear of what the API stockpile report would say.
   The market had expected the report to indicate an increase in gas
and heating oil, he said.
   But the API said crude stocks fell 2.91 million barrels to 341.94
million barrels last week, gasoline stocks fell 941,000 barrels to
220.13 million barrels, and other distillates fell 423,000 barrels
to 98.89 million barrels.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant began its
first atomic chain reaction Tuesday, a pivotal event for a $6
billion project vexed by years of delays, cost overruns and protests
that made it a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   Seabrook operators began a sustained nuclear fission reaction in
the plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel at 5:23 p.m., plant officials
said.
   Completed in July 1986, Seabrook received its federal low-power
license on May 26, a day after a federal appeals court declined to
block the tests.
   Three faulty safety valves delayed initial atomic operations by
about a week. Final preparations for the first fission reaction
resumed Monday.
   Then plant operators withdrew control rods from the reactor's
fuel core and slowly began diluting the boron concentration in the
reactor coolant water. Boron absorbs neutrons, preventing them from
striking and splitting uranium atoms to release more neutrons,
triggering a chain reaction.
   Seabrook originally was planned for commercial operation in 1979.
A twin reactor was abandoned, 25 percent complete. Both reactors
initially were to have cost less than $1 billion.
   Protests since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more
than 3,200 arrests, including 734 arrests in two days of civil
disobedience earlier this month.
   Low-power tests must be completed successfully before a nuclear
power plant may operate commercially. But before Seabrook may win
its full-power license, it also must gain final approval for
evacuation plans for crowded nearby beaches and communities up to 10
miles away.
   Massachusetts has six communities within 10 miles of Seabrook but
refuses to cooperate, saying evacuation of the area is not feasible.
Federal hearings are underway on evacuation plans Seabrook has
developed for Massachusetts.
   Federal regulators say approved evacuation plans are not needed
for low-power operation because the tests pose minuscule safety
risks.
   Seabrook's owners also may have to prove they are financially
qualified to run the plant commercially. Lead owner Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection, and
some of the other 11 New England utilities with Seabrook shares also
face financial problems.
   But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled in December that
those troubles pose no safety problem for low-power tests as long as
the owners posted a bond to pay to decommission the reactor after
the tests should it never operate commercially. Owners posted the
bond last month.
   Critics had argued that Seabrook should not be allowed to start
the tests and become contaminated by radioactive materials before
commercial operation is assured and dumps are available for the
plant's nuclear waste.
   Plant officials maintained that contamination would be minimal
outside the reactor vessel. However, with the start of a fission
reaction, spent uranium fuel would be classified as high-level
radioactive waste.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Predicts Higher Prices, Possible Gas Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists will see a new round of gasoline
price rises this summer, and a supply squeeze that could lead to gas
lines reminiscent of the 1970s, a consumer group said Tuesday.
   A report on the summer gasoline outlook by Buyers Up, a division
of the advocacy group Public Citizen, painted a grim picture for
motorists and called on federal authorities to investigate the oil
companies for possible price collusion.
   ``We could see spot shortages in the form of gas lines by the
beginning of August,'' said Christopher Dyson, director of research
for Buyers Up and chief author of the report.
   Dyson said gasoline prices at the pump could rise as much as 10
cents a gallon by the end of the summer, adding to a price spiral
this spring that triggered calls on Capitol Hill for the Justice
Department to investigate oil company pricing tactics.
   The Energy Department and many independent analysts said gasoline
prices are not likely to rise more than 4 or 5 cents a gallon this
summer, in part because of a recent decline in prices for the crude
oil from which gasoline is refined.
   The government said it expects no shortages barring a major
disruption of supplies.
   The oil industry's main trade group, the American Petroleum
Institute, issued a statement challenging the Buyers Up predictions.
   ``We are confident that gasoline supplies from both domestic and
foreign refineries will be adequate to meet the nation's needs this
summer,'' the institute said. ``Barring some unforeseen crisis that
affects supplies, we do not anticipate a shortage of gasoline or a
return of lines at retail outlets.''
   Prices jumped by about 15 cents a gallon following the March 24
Exxon oil spill in Alaska, which caused a brief squeeze on oil
supplies to the West Coast. The industry blamed the price rise on
normal seasonal increases in gasoline demand, new environmental
standards for gasoline and higher crude oil prices.
   In the lengthy report on the gasoline situation, Buyers Up said a
supply squeeze is likely because oil refiners will be unable to meet
growing demand for fuel. This is due to a combination of factors,
including oil company efforts to sell more high-octane gasoline,
which result in less gasoline produced per barrel of oil.
   The group also cited inadequate surplus stocks and a likelihood
that imports will be more limited than in the past, mainly because
of production constraints in Western Europe.
   ``Even an optimistic assessment of the situation raises the
possibility of gas lines this summer,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen.
   The report said gasoline supplies would be the tightest since the
energy crisis of the 1970s despite relatively abundant world oil
supplies.
   The authors called for increased regulation of the oil industry
and called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice
Department to investigate possible ``illicit oil company
cooperation'' to limit domestic supplies of gasoline.

   Engines that run on a mixture of fuels could help
the country switch from gasoline to the methanol auto fuel advocated
by President Bush for helping cut air pollution, engineers at a Ford
Motor Co. seminar said Tuesday.
   Automakers have been testing methanol-fueled vehicles for about
10 years, but the cars have relatively short driving ranges and fuel
availability generally is limited to cities where test programs are
in effect, said Donald R. Buist, Ford's director of automotive
emissions and fuel economy.
   A ``flexible fuel system'' that could burn methanol, gasoline, or
any mix of the two could make it easier to find fuel, which also
would ease consumer worriers about buying a methanol-powered car and
being unable to use or sell it anywhere but cities experimenting
with that fuel, engineers said.
   Included in the broad environmentalpackage Bush announced Monday
is a phased-in requirement for auto manufacturers to produce
alternatives to gasoline-powered autos in the nine major urban areas
with the worst smog problems.
   Gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone
that causes smog. Methanol emits less carbon monoxide than gasoline
but produces formaldehyde and other poisons.
   Ford's current methanol testing program includes a 700-car fleet
in smoggy Los Angeles.
   Methanol has about half the energy content as the same volume of
gasoline, so ``the driver's going to have to refuel twice as
often,'' Buist said. It was unclear how commercially-produced
methanol's cost would compare with gasoline, he said.
   Methanol, an alcohol derived from natural gas, coal or wood, also
is more corrosive than gasoline, so engineers must develop fuel
systems that can withstand it.
   Rewards will include some increase in performance along with the
lower emissions of smog-forming pollutants, the Ford engineers said.
   David L. Kulp, another in a group of Ford officials holding a
seminar for reporters on environmental and energy issues, said a
multi-fuel system would have a sensor that measures the
methanol-gasoline mix.
   The sensor would be connected to the car's engine-control
computer, which adjusts spark timing and the flow of fuel.
   General Motors Corp. has a ``variable fuel control'' system
designed to do the same thing on a fleet of 2,220 cars being
supplied to the California Energy Commission for a methanol
demonstration program.
   Ford also will supply 2,000 to 2,500 cars with similar fuel
controls for testing in a planned two-year program in the Los
Angeles area, said Buist, who serves on an advisory panel on
alternative fuels in California.

<HEAD>Prudential Securities Agrees to Buy Thomson McKinnon Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential Securities Group said Tuesday it has
agreed to acquire the parent of the brokerage concern Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in a deal that could create the nation's
third-largest brokerage operation.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Executives of the two concerns said the deal would result in
operating efficiencies that will improve profitability and enable
the resulting company to serve its clients better.
   George Ball, head of Prudential Securities and its
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. unit, said the deal ``underscores
our commitment to the retail securities business,'' which has sagged
since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The companies plan to merge the domestic retail brokerage
operations of Thomson McKinnon with those of Prudential-Bache
Securities into a retail brokerage arm to be called
Prudential-Bache-Thomson.
   Ball said in an interview that the new brokerage would compete
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. for ranking as the nation's
third-largest brokerage concern behind those run by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   The proposed transaction was announced jointly by Ball and by J.
Ronald Morgan, chairman and chief executive of Thomson McKinnon
Inc., who will become a vice chairman of the combined firm.
   Prudential Securities is owned by the Prudential Insurance Co. of
America.
   Thomson McKinnon is privately held, owned by its management, its
Employee Stock Ownership Trust and by the Hartford Insurance unit of
ITT Corp.
   In a separate development, Hartford said it had agreed to sell
its 23 percent stake in Thomson McKinnon to the securities firm in
advance of the Prudential deal.
   Prudential agreed under terms of its agreement to acquire the
outstanding Thomson shares from the Thomson management and the
employee trust.
   The statement said the price could not be stated because it is
subject to adjustments and earnings through the closing date.
   The deal is subject to a due diligence review and regulatory
approvals.
   The employee trust and Prudential Securities will each have about
a 28.5 percent interest in the Thomson McKinnon Asset Management LP,
57 percent of which is currently owned by Thomson McKinnon. The
partnership operates Thomson's money and investment management
business.
   The partnership went public in 1987 and its limited partnership
units, which comprise the remaining ownership, will continue to
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Ball said in an interview that the retail securities business
``is very unpopular now'' but that prospects are ``brighter than
they have ever been in the past.'' The combined firm will ``be in
position to prosper substantially as times do get better,'' he said.
   He said the short-term catalyst for the deal was to cut down on
overhead costs by allowing the two firms to share Prudential's
transaction processing operation.
   ``This is going to help profitability in a period of drought in
the retail business,'' he said.
   A longer-term benefit, Ball said, would be increased capacity to
create new products, capture market share and advertise in a way
that would help brokers and clients at both firms.
   The new firm will have about 20,000 employees and $1.3 billion in
capital, the companies said.
   Thomson McKinnon, established in 1885, claims to be the 9th
largest retail brokerage network with 154 offices worldwide and
about 4,700 employees, including 2,000 retail brokers.
   Prudential-Bache currently ranks fourth among the brokerages with
over 320 retail, commodity, investment banking and institutional
sales offices worldwide and more than 16,000 employees, including
over 6,000 retail brokers.

<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge Tuesday upheld a July 26
shareholder meeting for Prime Computer Inc., denying a request by
MAI Basic Four Inc. to force its takeover target to hold its annual
meeting Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Prime, which is attempting to thwart the MAI Basic
takeover bid by finding a friendly buyer, reported in court
documents it is ``currently in discussions with several Fortune
500-size companies and two well-established leverage buy-out firms.''
   The document said companies with which Prime is negotiating have
asked that their identities remain secret.
   In his decision Tuesday, Chancery Court Judge Maurice A. Hartnett
3rd rejected MAI Basic's argument that Delaware law compelled Prime
to hold a shareholders meeting every 13 months. The California
computer company had said the law compelled Prime to hold the
meeting Wednesday.
   Hartnett's five-page decision said the directors had sufficient
reason to postpone the meeting until July.
   In a letter to the court, MAI Basic attorney Michael Goldman said
Prime's move to postpone the meeting was a ``deliberate attempt by
the Prime board to prevent us from completing our offer.''
   Hartnett said MAI Basic, which is controlled by investor Bennett
S. LeBow, had failed to submit sufficient evidence to support that
allegation.
   Prime, in a statement from its Natick headquarters late Tuesday,
said the directors had postponed the meeting ``in order to permit
the stockholders to evaluate the new and much less attractive offer
from Basic and in order to give the directors reasonable time to
find alternatives to Basic's new offer.''
   On June 1, Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic lowered its original
$20-per-share cash offer to $19.50 per share for 75 percent of
Prime's stock, and notes for the remaining 25 percent.
   Prime's management said the true value of the offer declined from
$1.3 billion cash to ``$975 million in cash plus junk paper.''
   Prime Chief Executive Anthony L. Craig said the company is
``continuing active discussions with several potential purchasers,
all of whom need additional time to consider their bids and arrange
financing.''

<TEXT>
   The two Cincinnati-based department store units
of Campeau Corp. reported first-quarter losses Tuesday.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a $90.3 million loss
for the quarter, blaming it on its takeover and restructuring last
year by Toronto-based Campeau. Allied Stores Corp. reported a
first-quarter loss of $51.4 million.
   Federated said it anticipated the loss because of its interest
payments due on debt. The company also noted that more than half of
its annual retail profits are made in the fourth quarter.
   Federated reported a loss of $128.9 million for the comparable
quarter last year, when it was attempting to fight off the Campeau
takeover.
   Federated was taken over last summer by Campeau. The Canadian
retailer subsequently sold six Federated divisions and eliminated
3,650 jobs.
   Federated officials said Tuesday they were encouraged by the
company's first-quarter sales. The company said its net sales for
the 13 weeks ended April 29 were $1.02 billion, a 5.7 percent
increase from net sales of $970 million in the same divisions it
operated before the restructuring.
   Federated operates 130 department stores in 19 states under the
Abraham &amp; Straus, Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Lazarus and Rich's names.
   In last year's first quarter, Allied reported a loss of $107.9
million, excluding gains from the sales of its Ann Taylor and Brooks
Brothers divisions. Those sales amounted to $82.2 million and $340
million, respectively.
   Allied said its sales in comparable divisions for the 13 weeks
ended April 29 were $572.5 million, a 5.5 percent increase over the
previous first quarter.
   Allied operates 130 department stores in 16 states under the
Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Maas-Jordan Marsh Florida and The Bon Marche
names.

<HEAD>Pizza Empire's Founder Trading Presidency for Church Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. founder and owner Tom
Monaghan has resigned as president of the fast food empire, saying
he wants to serve the church instead of serving up more than $2
billion worth of pizza a year.
   Monaghan told thousands of Domino's employees via closed-circuit
television Monday that he would remain chairman and chief executive
officer, but was relinquishing the presidency.
   ``I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the
church more,'' said Monaghan, 52. ``I always wanted to be a priest.''
   Monaghan, who owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team and is known
for his collection of classic cars and devotion to architect Frank
Lloyd Wright, holds 97.5 percent of Domino's stock. But said he
would consider selling the company if the transaction benefited
Domino's Pizza Foundation, which runs Monaghan's philanthropic
efforts.
   The foundation supports a Roman Catholic missionary priest in
Honduras, where Monaghan has dispatched planeloads of dentists,
doctors and medical supplies.
   ``We're building dams, teaching farming, setting up a medical
clinic and spreading the gospel,'' said Monaghan, who spent his
childhood in a Catholic orphanage and attended a Grand Rapids
seminary. He also founded Legatus, a group of Catholic business
executives who monitor business ethics.
   Monaghan said he plans to devote more time to Legatus and to
other church-related activities.
   Monaghan said he will concentrate on long-range planning and
leave daily responsibilities to David Black, 40, the company's new
president after eight years as vice president of operations.
   The last time Monaghan turned over Domino's reins was in 1975,
when Leroy Russell Hughes was named president. Hughes didn't last
long in the job.
   ``It just didn't work out,'' said Monaghan, adding that he
believed it was a mistake to hire an outsider. He said this time it
should work out because he hired a company veteran for the job.
   Monaghan founded Domino's in 1960. The pizza-delivery chain has
grown to 5,000 outlets in all 50 states and 16 countries, becoming
the nation's second-largest pizza maker after the Pizza Hut unit of
Pepsico Inc. It reported a 1988 profit of $6.1 million on sales of
$2.3 billion.

<TEXT>
   The House will test the possibility of raising
taxes to cover $100 billion savings and loan losses as an
alternative to borrowing the money.
   Up to now, the only live alternatives being considered for
financing the bailout had been swelling the federal deficit or a
complex high-cost off-budget bond scheme proposed by President Bush.
   With the S&amp;L bill scheduled to reach the House floor on Wednesday
after four months of work, the House Rules Committee on Tuesday
agreed to let lawmakers vote on three financing alternatives as well
as separate measures to weaken and toughen Bush's proposed
regulatory reforms.
   Efforts to pay for the bailout through a tax increase or massive
cuts in domestic spending programs were defeated soundly in the
House Ways and Means Committee and were never even formally
considered by the Senate.
   And administration officials have repeatedly vowed to recommend
that Bush veto the bill if Congress adopted anything other than his
proposal to finance the $50 billion immediate taxpayer share of the
cleanup through 30-year private bonds.
   In a statement issued soon after the Rules Committee action,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said, ``We strongly urge the House
to reject any amendments that would weaken the capital standards.
Only tangible captial _ real, hard cash _ provides the deposit
insurance fund and the taxpayers with protection necessary to ensure
a thrift crisis never happens again.''
   And on-budget borrowing to pay for the bailout ``is a grave
mistake and will affect markets. In addition the administration's
plan is the best method to lock up the thrift industry
contribution.''
   The House Ways and Means Committee, citing a potential $4.5
billion savings in lower interest costs to taxpayers over the next
30 years, wants to make Bush borrow the money directly through the
Treasury but exempt the new debt from Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
targets.
   Brady and other administration officials have vigorously opposed
that, saying it would open the door for allowing other needs such as
cleaning up nuclear wastes and the war on drugs to swell the deficit
and eventually force a tax increase.
   Under the Rules Committee's action Tuesday, House members will
get to vote on rejecting Bush's plan in favor of borrowing the money
directly through the Treasury.
   But there also will be a vote on an amendment by Rep. John
LaFalce, D-N.Y., on refusing to exempt the bailout costs from the
budget balancing targets.
   ``If we adopt the LaFalce amendment, we're going to have to raise
taxes or cut spending,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. ``I don't
think it's going to pass but at least we'll get a good, fair debate
on the issue.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois and administration
officials have conceded that they expect Bush's financing scheme to
go down to defeat on a partisan vote in the House.
   But with Senate Democrats falling 12 votes short of what was
needed to kill it in April, the administration has hopes of
prevailing when House and Senate negotiators meet later to iron out
differences in the two versions of the bill.
   What remains uncertain is whether Bush's call for making some 450
marginally healthy thrifts put up $6 billion new capital over the
next five years will survive without a major loophole _ so-called
supervisory good will.
   The administration and the House Democratic leadership have
agreed on graudally phasing out the ``good will'' exemptions from
capital requirements over the next five years. This allows S&amp;Ls to
count intangible assets such as customer allegiance, name
recognition and the like as if they had a cash value.
   However, all but about a dozen of the House's 175 Republicans as
well as several Democrats from districts with S&amp;Ls that would have
difficulty coming up with the money were alligned on the other side.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., claimed support for
Bush's tough capital approach was sufficient to defeat weakening
amendments by Reps. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and James Quillen, R-Tenn.
   But Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the
House Banking Committee and one of the few GOP members alligned with
Democrats in supporting Bush's approach, said the industry ``has
someone in from every member's district'' in its lobbying effort
against the Bush proposals.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., the agency that will be responsible for cleaning up the S&amp;L
problems, said the administration may ``lose some ground but they're
not going to lose the fight'' on the capital issue.
   Figures released Tuesday by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the
industry's main regulator, show that the nation's 2,938 S&amp;Ls
actually have more ``good will'' exemptions from the capital
requirements than actual tangible capital invested in their
businesses.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega announced pay
raises of up to 50 percent for public employees on Tuesday and
accused businessmen of fueling inflation by speculating in dollars.
   Taxicab drivers stopped work on Tuesday in Managua and three
other major cities _ Leon, Granada and Masaya _ to protest
government measures that doubled the price of gasoline and devalued
the national currency by half.
   The austerity measures by the leftist Sandinista government were
aimed at combating inflation.
   The cabbies, who steered clear of calling their action a strike,
formed a panel that started negotiations with government officials
over a list of demands.
   On Monday, Ortega ordered the sharpest currency devaluation so
far this year, causing prices to skyrocket. The 52 percent
devaluation brought down the cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, from
9,500 to the U.S. dollar Friday to 20,000 per dollar on Monday.
   That kicked off a massive rise in prices for everything, from
food and transportation to clothing, services and entertainment.
   Food prices doubled and markets emptied. Cab drivers doubled
their fares but found few takers.
   Ortega said Tuesday that Nicaragua will have to import basic
foods in June and July, and will further restrict the financing of
investments.
   He had announced on Monday a 110 percent rise in the price of
gasoline _ from 17,700 cordobas a gallon to 37,200 cordobas.
   The president said then there would be no further devaluations in
the cordoba this month. He also said he hoped to halt black market
speculation in dollars that he said fuels inflation.
   Bus fares on routes within Managua went up from 500 to 750
Cordobas overnight and dozens of people on Tuesday hitched rides
from private car owners saying they couldn't afford the new fares.
Most cabs emptied after the fares doubled.
   Sales also dropped in food markets after prices shot up following
the devaluation.
   Ortega said the nation's 43,000 public school teachers and health
workers will get a 50 percent pay raise to make up for losses to
inflation. Teachers also will receive a 14 percent increase that
Ortega promised May 20 after several schools were shut down by
wildcat strikes.
   An additional 87,000 government employees will receive a 36
percent pay raises, retroactive to June 1, Ortega said.
   Speaking on government television, Ortega said businessmen were
fueling cost of living increases by speculating in dollars.
   ``Over these last few weeks a great deal of money has been moving
in the speculative markets. And over the last few days there has
been a massive withdrawal of savings in order to speculate,'' he
said.
   Inflation was 15.5 percent in May. The cost of living rose 20,000
percent last year.
   The government has said that an austerity program launched in
January has checked hyperinflation. But the program also brought a
recession.
   Nicaragua, traditionally a food exporter to the rest of Central
America, will have to import basic foods such as tomatoes, onions,
bananas and cabbages in June and July to make up for domestic
shortages, Ortega said.
   To stimulate production, the government has been giving financial
incentives to agricultural producers, who began their seasonal
plantings in May. But lack of rain destroyed seeds already planted
and many fields had to be planted again, an extra expense the
economy can ill afford.

two recent engine failures should be grounded for engine
modifications, Boeing Co. and engine manufacturer CFM International
recommended Tuesday.
   On Monday, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority grounded all 12
Boeing 737-400s operated by British airlines after two of the jets
experienced engine failure. On Tuesday, West German officials
ordered that the engines be checked on the four 737-400 jets used in
that country.
   The jets all are powered by by CFM56-3C engines, made by CFM
International, a consortium of SNECMA of France and General Electric
Co. of the United States.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was preparing an
airworthiness directive instructing U.S. airlines to inspect the fan
blades on engines in their Boeing 737-400s and to operate them at a
lower power thrust, Dave Duff, an FAA spokesman in Seattle,
confirmed Monday. That directive was expected to be issued by
mid-week.
   Recommendations from Boeing and the engine manufacturer include
replacing fan blades and lowering the maximum thrust to 22,000
pounds from 23,500 pounds that current CFM56-3C engines provide, a
Boeing statement said.
   The recommendation affects 29 CFM56-3C-powered jets outside the
United States and five in this country. All five of the U.S. jets
are operated by USAir, T. Craig Martin of Boeing said Tuesday.
   Boeing's announcement was not made to try to head off the
expected FAA directive, Martin said.
   ``We have been working very closely with the FAA as well as with
CFM,'' Martin said.
   ``The CFM56-3C engine problems result when fan blades break at a
very high rpm, scattering parts into the engine,'' Martin said.
   The engine failures on the British jets involved damage to fan
blades. The same model engine and plane also were involved in a
fatal crash in January in Britain.
   On Friday, a Dan-Air 737-400 carrying 100 charter passengers to
Minorca returned to London's Gatwick airport after developing severe
vibration in one engine.
   On Sunday, a British Midlands 737-400 flying from London's
Heathrow airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with 80 people aboard
made an emergency landing at East Midlands airport after a problem
developed in one engine.
   In both cases, the airlines reported that turbofan blades had
been damaged.
   Questions about the CFM56-3C engine arose in January after the
crash of a British Midlands Boeing 737-400 at East Midlands airport
that killed 47 people.
   The pilot had reported that one engine failed in flight, but
investigators later found the plane's good engine had been shut down
before the emergency landing was attempted. The investigation has
not been completed.

<HEAD>Creditors Seek To Force Lone Star Steel Subsidiary Into Bankruptcy</HEAD>

   Creditors of East Texas Steel Facilities Inc.,
whose pipemaking operation has been undercut by the energy-industry
depression, on Tuesday asked a judge to put the company in
bankruptcy proceedings after it failed make a $43.8 million payment
on its debt.
   Lone Star Technologies Inc., East Texas' parent company, said the
petition was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas by eight banks
that hold about $124.38 million in unsecured debt they previously
declared to be in default.
   The involuntary petition was filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. It does not include Lone Star's other subsidiaries.
   East Texas, which was known as Lone Star Steel Inc. until
January, has 20 days to answer the petition. One such response could
be its own voluntary petition for protection from creditors while it
devises a reorganization plan.
   Lone Star Technologies has been trying to scale back and
restructure its oilfield pipemaking operation for years as the
demand for drilling equipment fell.
   That restructuring included numerous layoffs. No longer is Lone
Star the largest private employer in North Texas, a distinction it
held for four decades.
   Most of the company's steel operations are located in the town of
Lone Star, built by the company to take advantage of the ore-rich
soil about 140 miles east of Dallas.
   The company also ventured into Texas' troubled thrift industry,
establishing American Federal Bank last year to purchase failed S&amp;Ls
under the so-called Southwest Plan.
   Earnings from the bank last year helped reduce Lone Star's losses
by $6.7 million, but it wasn't enough to overcome a $26.4 million
loss at East Texas. Overall, Lone Star Technologies posted a $40.2
million loss, its fifth deficit in the last six years.
   Also last year, Lone Star's debt increased threefold to $360.4
million, much of it to buy slab steel used to manufacture pipe.
   But uncertainty over oil prices caused a virtual cessation of
pipe purchases last year, and inventories have built up, the company
has said.
   The company was unable to pay interest on its debt in March and
missed a $43.8 million principal payment due March 31, opening the
door for the creditors, led by NCNB Texas National Bank, to try to
force the unit into bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Share Prices Inch Down</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to CORRECT Wednesday's opening and Tuesday's
closing dollar figures and to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>

   The U.S. dollar was lower against the Japanese yen
at late morning Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange inched down.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 241.97 points the
previous day, lost another 29.68 points, or 0.09 percent, ending the
morning session at 33,183.87. Although the index rose earlier in
morning trading, it reversed the trend and fell.
   The dollar was changing hands at 148.15 yen at late morning,
after opening at 148.20 yen, down 0.50 yen from Tuesday's 148.70-yen
finish. The currency moved in the narrow range of 148.05 to 148.30
yen.
   Traders said the U.S. currency started lower in Tokyo following a
large-scale dollar-selling intervention overnight in New York by the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader said dealing in Tokyo was quiet Wednesday,
with the majority of investors avoiding major moves, waiting for the
U.S. trade report for April scheduled to be released Thursday in
Washington.
   ``Some sources were saying the Bank of Japan also intervened in
the Tokyo market this morning, but it hasn't been confirmed,'' he
said anonymously.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told Kyodo
News Service that the dollar's recent surge against the Japanese yen
has come to a halt.
   On the stock exchange, a dealer at Nikko Securities attributed
the Nikkei's fall to ``the market's lack of energy.''
   ``The exchange rate seems to be stabilizing, but the majority of
institutional investors were still in a wait-and-see mood,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said participants sold issues sensitive to fluctuation of
interest rates, such as steel firms, due to uncertainties over the
dollar-yen rate.
   ``The market's cautiousness was also due to everyone's waiting
for the report of U.S. trade figures,'' he added.
