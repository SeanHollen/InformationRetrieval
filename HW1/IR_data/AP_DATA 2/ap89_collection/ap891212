<HEAD>Scientists Find Some Evidence Backing Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence showing ``cold fusion'' may be a
real way to produce energy was presented Tuesday by Tennessee
scientists, prompting a senator to urge the government to
reconsider a recommendation against special funding for such
research.
   But a member of a U.S. Department of Energy advisory board that
recommended against such funding said the panel remains unconvinced
by the new findings.
   Gordon Michaels of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee
presented the new results here Tuesday to a meeting of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers.
   Chuck Scott, a chemist and senior research fellow who leads the
lab's research team, said the experiments repeatedly found
unexplained excesses of energy released in the form of heat, and
also found inconsistent signs of neutrons and the chemical tritium,
which are products of fusion reactions.
   ``We feel very strongly we have observed excess energy,'' he
said. ``We feel confident in being able to measure the heat. It was
sufficiently above experimental noise that we know it's really
there.''
   Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun and hydrogen
bombs. Attempts to harness it as an unlimited source of energy
previously concentrated on simulating the extremely high
temperatures and pressures found in the sun.
   Chemist B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and a
colleague, Martin Fleischmann of England, announced in March they
had created a nuclear fusion reaction in a bottle of heavy water
using a palladium electrode wrapped in platinum wire. They ran
electricity through the two metals and reported that the device put
out more energy than they put into it.
   The potential to create vast amounts of power in a jar of water,
which could be cheap, easy and have relatively benign by-products,
sparked a furious series of attempts by scientists around the world
to reproduce the Pons-Fleischmann results.
   But many scientists soon became convinced that Pons and
Fleischmann were mistaken and that their research was sloppy.
   The new findings prompted U.S. Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, to urge
the Energy Department _ which oversees Oak Ridge National
Laboratory _ to reverse a recommendation against special funding
for cold fusion research. The recommendation was made by the
department's Energy Research Advisory Board.
   Advisory board co-chairman John R. Huizenga, a chemistry and
physics professor at the University of Rochester, N.Y., said the
panel remains unconvinced by the Oak Ridge experiments.
   He said the panel considered the findings in writing its report
and recommendations to Secretary of Energy James D. Watkins. The
panel, which issued the final report Friday, was sympathetic toward
restricted study within present funding limits.
   The Oak Ridge group has been doing tests since April. Scott said
excess energy was measured for several hours at a stretch, usually
on the order of 5 percent to 8 percent above what would be
considered normal. On one occasion excess heat of up to 50 percent
was measured for a period of 12 hours, he said.
   The Oak Ridge researchers also found what seemed to be excess
levels of neutrons and tritium, but not consistently. Asked what
the results mean, Scott replied: ``I don't know.''

<HEAD>Flying Dutchman Sails into Met after Long Absence</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs separate planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legend has it that the Flying Dutchman was
condemned to roam the seas eternally, coming ashore just once every
seven years in search of redemption.
   His ordeal was nothing compared to that of Metropolitan Opera
audiences, who have had to wait more than a decade between
performances of Wagner's youthful masterpiece about the ghostly
sailor.
   The Met's reluctance was understandable. Its last attempt at
``The Flying Dutchman,'' by the late Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, was
nearly hooted off the stage at its 1979 premiere. That production,
which turned the action into the dream of a minor character, is now
frequently cited as a textbook case of how a composer's intention
can be distorted for the sake of operatic novelty.
   For its new staging, which premiered Monday night, the company
wisely called on a traditionalist, August Everding, the head of the
Bavarian State Opera who has successfully produced several other
operas here, including Wagner's ``Lohengrin.''
   Everding's ``Dutchman,'' with sets by Hans Schavernoch, costumes
by Lore Haas and lighting by Gil Wechsler, is impressive to look
at, from the forbidding rocks that line the Norwegian coast to the
ominous appearance of the Dutchman's ship and its sepulchral crew.
The Dutchman arrives on a mechanized gangplank that may be
anachronistic for the 18th century but is eerily effective. Less
apparent is why a Norwegian house of the period would have electric
lights, or why the spinning wheels Wagner calls for have been
replaced by sewing machines.
   No production of the opera will get very far unless the title
role is strongly cast, and here the Met was fortunate to have bass
James Morris. He began tentatively, failing to make the most of his
brooding opening soliloquy, but his resonant tones became
impressive in the Act Two love duet and thrilling in the closing
moments of the opera.
   As Senta, the maiden who is willing to die to bring the Dutchman
salvation, soprano Mechtild Gessendorf filled the house with
bright, silvery tones and threw herself into the role
enthusiastically. Vocally, she fell short only in her upper
register, which on occasion turned screechy.
   In supporting roles, bass Paul Plishka was a stalwart Daland,
Senta's pragmatic father, and tenor Gary Lakes was suitably
distraught as Erik, her jilted fiance. Tenor Robert Gambill, making
his debut as the Steersman, displayed a small but beautiful voice.
   Music director James Levine conducted the Met orchestra, which,
as usual these days, sounded superb.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-foot-long alligator, freed from ice at a
reservoir, is resting comfortably in a box at an Indianapolis
couple's home.
   Dale Bertelson, an environmental consultant, and his wife,
Marilyn, aren't that comfortable about the arrangement.
   ``Hamsters and fish are one thing, but this is something else,''
said Bertelson.
   The alligator was found Saturday near Eagle Creek Reservoir dam
by children who saw its snout. It was revived the next day after
the Bertelsons broke the ice and pulled it free.
   ``As soon as we got it out of the hole the thing started moving
its feet around. We carried it back in a box. And there we are,''
Bertelson said.
   The Bertelsons hope to find animal experts to take the alligator.
   ``I don't want to become a foster parent here. It's probably not
in my lease I can have one of these,'' Bertelson said.

   Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But
he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations.
   ``It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage
concerts devoted to his music,'' Voss said recently. ``We get the
14-year-olds and the 34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem
to know who Jimi Hendrix was.
   ``There's sort of a gap there _ part of a generation apparently
doesn't realize what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed
today.''
   Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an
unsettling, feedback-laden rendition of the national anthem at the
Woodstock music festival.
   A former music journalist, Voss is founder of the Jimi Hendrix
Information Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum
of the star's memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter
titled ``Voodoo Child,'' a name taken from a Hendrix hit.
   He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the
Seattle-born Hendrix since his drug-related death in a British
ambulance Sept. 18, 1970.
   ``As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20
hours a week on Jimi Hendrix,'' Voss, 38, said in a telephone
interview from his Des Plaines home.
   The newsletter has about 1,500 subscribers, including one fan in
the Soviet Union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such
Hendrix selections as ``Foxy Lady'' and ``Purple Haze.''
   A recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members
of Hendrix's various backup bands and the going prices for Hendrix
memorabilia, ranging from $4 for a mass-printed poster to $4,495
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician.
   ``I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by
Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from
$15,000 to $25,000,'' Voss said.
   ``That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a
Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched
it.''
   Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years. That's
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance,
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar
lying in feedback-shrieking flames.
   ``I don't know how many guitars Jimi destroyed, but I do know
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new
guitars from the pieces,'' Voss said.
   When Voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs, concert halls
and college campuses around the Midwest, he notices many visitors
staring at one exhibit _ a copy of Hendrix' death certificate,
which ends with the words: ``Insufficient evidence of circumstances
_ open verdict.''
   ``Too many people these days only know Hendrix as a `victim' of
drugs, they don't know about his genius as a musician,'' Voss said.
   ``The fact is that although his death was drug-related, Jimi
Hendrix did not die of an overdose. He was not even known among the
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user _ although I
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it
would be now.''

   Police in this town 20 miles north of
Dallas are stopping motorists if they're driving courteously. Then,
they pay them.
   Police are handing out $20 cash certificates until Christmas Eve
to good drivers. Cash-winning behavior includes allowing someone to
change lanes or letting a car into the road during bumper-to-bumper
traffic.
   The Christmas-season program, courtesy of the Addison Police
Department and Addison Rotary Club, is in its fifth year. Last
year, 200 drivers received the certificates.
   ``Texas is known as the `Friendly State.' We wanted to encourage
that Texas spirit in Addison by rewarding friendly drivers during
the holiday season,'' Addison Rotary Club President Sam Zarro said.
   Police Capt. Tommy Buchanan said some drivers aren't all that
nice when police pull them over.
   ``Some of them are upset when you first stop them, but when they
find out, they get an attitudinal change,'' Buchanan said.

   Walt Disney Pictures is the winner
of the 1989 Dunce Cap Award by SPELL, the Society for the
Preservation of English Language and Literature, for the popular
film, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.''
   It should have been ``Honey, I Shrank the Kids.''
   SPELL, a 2,000-member, non-profit organization based in Mountain
View, confers the annual awards on ``perpetrators of especially
egregious errors in usage, spelling and punctuation inflicted on
the public's sensibilities.''
   Richard Lederer, author of ``Anguished English,'' ``Get Thee to
a Punnery,'' and ``Crazy English,'' is the sole judge.
   ``We're not grammar police, as some people have called us,''
said William S. Penn Jr., SPELL's vice president and a retired
business professor at San Jose State. ``We're just people who think
the English language should be saved from the careless and
ignorant.''
   A Disney official defended the use of ``shrunk.''
   ``It was done deliberately. It was not an error,'' said the
official, who wouldn't give his name. ``That's what Rick Moranis,
the father in the movie, says: ``Honey, I shrunk the kids.'' The
title was taken from that.''
   And it worked, the official said: The film grossed more than
$129 million.
   SPELL's dart wasn't news to Disney. Dozens of people wrote or
called to point it out, the official said.

   The Mustang Ranch may soon be an equal
opportunity brothel: The owner wants to add dudes.
   ``This will be a place for women to have a little fun for a
change,'' said Joe Conforte.
   Conforte said he wants to build an addition called Mustang F for
``female.'' He said it would have ``high class'' facilities and a
band where employees could romance women ``who just want sex
without entanglements.''
   ``Sure, a lot of women just want to be wined and dined, but
believe me they'll want the sex, too,'' Conforte said. ``But with
women you got to treat them differently. You got to show them the
stars and the moon.''
   The plan hinges on a stock offering for the brothel. The
underwriter of the offering said more than enough buyers have
expressed interest in a $17 million proposal to start selling
shares before Christmas.
   Eric Walloga of American Wallstreet Securities Inc., of Tampa,
Fla., said the issue is nearly ready to go on the market just one
month after a restructured proposal was approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   ``We have indications that we are past the $17 million mark, but
we want to wait until we have at least $30 million or $40 million
just in case people don't go through with plans to buy the stock,''
Walloga said.
   The stockholders would buy into a 60 percent interest in the
350-acre ranch and other properties as well as the business itself.
Conforte and his wife, Sally, would retain the remaining 40 percent
interest and manage the ranch.
   Conforte said the proposed brothel for women could be added to
the current 105-room bordello within six months if the stock
offering goes well. He's raising the money to pay $13 million owed
to the Internal Revenue Service.
   Brothels are allowed in 11 of Nevada's 14 rural counties.
   Conforte said he tried employing male escorts 14 years ago at
the brothel 10 miles east of Reno, but ended the practice after
deciding he needed a separate building for women clients.
   ``I always planned to build it, but I kept putting it off,'' he
said. ``But recently I got a call from a nationally known woman,
who I won't name, and she asked why I didn't hire men and it got me
thinking again.''
   Conforte, who will be 64 in January, has been trying to sell
Mustang since 1985 when he was released after serving 18 months in
prison for tax evasion. His first two attempts to take the Mustang
public failed.

   Christmas at the White House is a storybook
affair this year, with characters from children's literature
peeping out from the branches of an 18-foot Fraser fir decorated
for the holidays.
   Barbara Bush on Monday gave reporters a tour of the lavish White
House holiday decorations, including the Christmas tree in the Blue
Room on the first floor.
   With a theme that Mrs. Bush said was a ``celebration of books
and libraries,'' the tree features 80 soft dolls representing
characters from children's books or literature.
   Among them are Mary Poppins, Babar the elephant, the Mad Hatter,
Tin Man, Pinocchio, Scarlett O'Hara, Curious George, the Velveteen
Rabbit and Aladdin.
   Mrs. Bush said she hoped her holiday choice will encourage
families to read together.
   ``There is sort of a little message to our Christmas this year _
which is a family oriented, reading to their children message,''
she said.
   Tiny books also adorn the tree, and beneath its branches are an
array of books wrapped with bows.
   The tree also features homemade decorated cookies and the
traditional 100 4-inch velvet balls, two representing each state in
the nation.
   Mrs. Bush said she began planning the Christmas decorations in
February with White house chief floral designer, Nancy Clarke.
   The entrance and cross halls feature 16 additional trees, large
Blue Spruces flocked with artificial snow and decorated with tiny
white lights, icicles and tinsel.
   Two more Blue Spruces stand at either end of the ceremonial East
Room, ornately garlanded with copper-red metallic ribbons and
bursting with life-size plastic grapes, pears, apples, oranges,
tangerines and pomegranates.
   Also in the East Room, against a central mirror, is displayed
the baroque 48-figure creche that has been in the White House each
Christmas since it was donated by a New Jersey woman in 1967.
   In the State Dining Room, the central feature is a 36-inch tall
gingerbread house. White House Chef Hans Raffert has made a similar
creation every year for 20 Christmases.
   The dining room also has two boxwood topiaries decorated with
densely packed candy canes, peppermint balls and cookies.
   The entire Bush clan _ five children, spouses and 11
grandchildren _ will accompany the president and Mrs. Bush next
week to the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., for Christmas.
   Mrs. Bush predicted ``chaos'' when the family opens gifts
Christmas morning.
   She and the president will not exchange gifts.
   ``We do not give presents, the president and I,'' she said
adding that it is an arrangement they have followed for many years.
``We felt we just had so much.''
   The White House decorations were put up over the weekend by 40
volunteers.
   ``We bounced up and down the stairs, George and I, talking to
these people,'' she said.
   The Bushes' own Christmas tree in their private upstairs
quarters is decorated with cookies, Mrs. Bush said.

<HEAD>Groups Say 1990 Harvest Critical for Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three organizations trying to pull Poland into
the world of agricultural capitalism say the 1990 harvest is
critical, and are urging U.S. agribusiness to donate machinery and
chemicals.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Sabre Foundation and the
Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture told
representatives of farm-related businesses at a seminar Monday that
their donations would be tax deductible.
   The U.S. tax code allows for a deduction of twice the cost for
donations of inventory property for the care of the ill, the needy
or minor children. Private Polish farmers qualify as needy under
the code, said tax lawyer Stuart A. Smith, who appeared on a panel
at the seminar.
   ``Poland has the potential to be a major contributor to the
world food supply, but it is not a major contributor at this
time,'' said David Hopper, World Bank senior vice president.
   He said 77 percent of the farms are privately owned, while 23
percent are state-owned cooperatives that have been the only
beneficiaries of technological advancements made in Polish
agriculture.
   ``The private sector has been starved from modern inputs,''
Hopper said, adding that productivity is low as a result.
   ``They are good farmers, but they don't know how to farm in the
context of modern agriculture,'' Hopper said.
   Under the plan devised by the Sabre Foundation, state
cooperatives would be omitted from U.S. private sector donations
because the tax code requires the donations to go to private
individuals to qualify as deductions.
   That will keep the remnants of the communist system from
benefiting from American private industry's efforts and will boost
the private side of Poland's agricultural economy, Smith said.
   The donations are needed because of a gap in the $533 million
aid package Congress provided Hungary and Poland, said Josiah Lee
Auspitz, secretary of the Sabre Foundation.
   The government is sending commodities and expertise to Poland,
but there was no provision in the law for the products and
equipment needed to make a modern farm system work, Auspitz said.
   Polish banks don't have the money that Americans banks do to
give loans against next year's harvest to enable the farmers to buy
machinery, pesticides and fertilizers, he said.
   Fertilizers, animal care products, animal feed, pesticides,
fungicides and herbicides top the list of items Polish farmers
need. Also needed is machinery such as tractors, planters, grain
drills, potato seeders, fertilizer spreaders, manure spreaders,
plows, sprayers, chain saws and harvesters.
   Many of the private farms are small and others are part-time
operations used by families as a buffer against food shortages,
said J.B. Penn of Sparks Commodities Inc. Penn has been working
with the Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture.
   Of the 2.7 million farms in Poland, about 1.25 million are
producing for the marketplace, he said.
   The experts at the seminar were optimistic about Poland's
ability to move to a privately controlled agricultural system
because of the large number of private farms already operating.
   But success rests on proving the private farms can get more food
to the Polish people than they've been getting from the state
cooperatives, they said.
   Polish farmers need the machinery and chemicals by April 1, the
beginning of the growing season, to show progress in the 1990
harvest.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher sent a letter to the seminar
encouraging participation, saying Sabre's plan follows the intent
of the agreement he signed on private sector cooperation between
Poland and the United States.
   Founded in 1969 as an educational-scientific tax-exempt
organization, the Sabre Foundation describes itself as ``devoted to
the philosophy and practice of free institutions.''
   The Foundation for the Development of Polish Agriculture is a
non-profit, private foundation established in February 1988 to
strengthen Poland's private sector farms.

   ``The War of the Roses'' narrowly won the
weekend box office battle, easing ahead of ``National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation'' by less than $200,000.
   ``The War of the Roses,'' a dark comedy about marital hatred
starring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, came
out on top with $9.7 million. ``Christmas Vacation,'' starring
Chevy Chase, finished with $9.5 million.
   ``It's one of the tighter races in a long time,'' said John
Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., which tracks box office
performance.
   ``Back to the Future Part II'' dropped to third place, taking in
$7 million in its third week of release. The Michael J. Fox
time-warp fantasy has accumulated nearly $70 million since
Thanksgiving Eve.
   The fourth-place, $3.5 million debut of ``She-Devil'' was a
disappointment, despite what appeared to be the sure-fire hit
pairing of Oscar-winner Meryl Streep and TV's Roseanne Barr in her
first movie role.
   ``Steel Magnolias'' was fifth with $3 million and ``Harlem
Nights'' was sixth with $2.9 million.
   Disney's ``The Little Mermaid'' feature-length cartoon earned
$2.8 million for seventh place, followed by ``Look Who's Talking,''
with $2.5 million.
   ``Prancer'' was in ninth with $1.7 million and the season's
other animated release, ``All Dogs Go To Heaven,'' rounded out the
top 10 with $1.5 million.

   The 41-year-old director of such hits as the Indiana Jones
movies said the screenplay by his sister, Anne, would be different
from the adventure films he's known for. Her screenplay credits
include ``Big.''
   ``Annie wrote a really small, wonderful story about the two of
us and my mother,'' Spielberg said during an interview published
Monday in The Cincinnati Post. ``It's more of a comedy than an
intimate portrait of our growing up.''
   Spielberg was born in Cincinnati on Dec. 18, 1947, while his
father was an electrical engineering student at the University of
Cincinnati. The family moved to California four years later.
   He said the movie should be filmed in Cincinnati, preferably in
fall.
   ``That's where the script takes place,'' he said. ``Besides,
there's nothing in L.A. that looks like Cincinnati _ nothing.''

   John Z. De Lorean is still tied up in
lawsuits stemming from the bankruptcy of his car company, but he
says things are looking up five years after his acquittal on
cocaine-trafficking charges.
   The 64-year-old carmaker says he's back on good terms with his
former wife, Cristina Ferrare, after a bitter divorce. He said he's
dating someone else, but the reconciliation with Ms. Ferrare
improves life for their children.
   De Lorean sees an end to the lawsuits that have been holding up
his plans to start producing another super-luxury car.
   ``All these things, if they don't kill you they make you
stronger,'' he said Friday in a telephone interview from New York.
   He's enthusiastic about the planned new car, which he hopes to
build in Germany: ``It's going to be an exotic, a V-12, very high
performance car and it will be very expensive, in the $175,000
range. The more expensive and more limited, the less it costs to go
in.''

   ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' a TV series about
16-year-old physician, is even more improbable than the premise of
most shows, say officials at two of the country's top medical
schools.
   Dr. Doogie, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is just too far ahead
of his time, said Helen Rakin, a Harvard Medical School admissions
officer.
   ``Doogie Howser would have had to graduate from college at 9,
start medical school at 10, graduate from medical school at 14,
then, after one year of internship and one year of residency,
obtain his license to practice at 16,'' she said in this week's TV
Guide. ``I don't think so.''
   Dr. Henry M. Seidel, associate dean of students at Johns Hopkins
Medical School, said that if he were on the admissions committee, a
real-life Doogie would never be accepted to medical school.
   ``I would say to Doogie, `Look, we need people with smarts.
You've got that. Now all you need is the rest of it. ... When you
get to be 19 or 20, then come back and reapply, and chances are,
you're gonna get in. But Doogie, not now. Just get your first
kiss.'''

   Investigators who reexamined the dogsled trek
of Robert E. Peary over the Arctic ice say he discovered the North
Pole exactly where, when and how he claimed _ the snow, cold,
``dead reckoning'' navigational methods and skeptics
notwithstanding.
   ``The family is vindicated!'' declared Peary grandson Edward
Peary Stafford, a retired Navy commander, after the Navigation
Foundation, at the behest and expense of the National Geographic
Society, accepted Peary's account in every detail.
   People who still disagree, said Stafford, ``should join the Flat
Earth Society.''
   But National Geographic President Gilbert Grosvenor said he
suspects doubters will persist, as they have for 80 years.
   One of the most insistent is Baltimore astronomer Dennis
Rawlins, who called the foundation's findings a ``whitewash.''
   Rawlins claimed in a 1973 book that Peary had not gotten within
100 miles of the North Pole and had perpetuated the greatest
scientific hoax of the century.
   ``Bias can do a lot, and when you want to believe something it
is easy to,'' Rawlins said. ``It is a tragedy for American
science.''
   At a 95-minute news conference Monday, retired Adm. Thomas D.
Davies, president of the Navigation Foundation, said scientific
analysis established that Peary was where he claimed to be on April
6, 1909 _ on ``the top of the world.''
   A study of the shadows in Peary's photographs established they
were taken en route to and at the pole, he said. And the depth
measurements the explorer made by dropping a piece of lead tied to
piano wire in holes in the ice were verified by modern maps of the
Arctic Ocean's bottom.
   The foundation said its 240-page report will ``perhaps put an
end to the long process of vilification of a courageous American
explorer.''
   ``Our analysis of the data Peary brought back from his journey _
his celestial sights, his diary, his ocean sounding and his
photographs _ has convinced us that their final camp, named Camp
Jesup, was no more than five miles from the Pole, allowing for some
inaccuracy in their instruments,'' the report said.
   From the start, Peary's claim that he and companion Matthew
Henson and four Eskimos reached the pole has been wrapped in
controversy.
   Upon reaching home, a dismayed Peary discovered that another
explorer, Frederick Cook, said he had beaten Peary by a year.
Cook's claim was eventually rejected and in 1911 Congress certified
Peary as the discoverer.
   The issue reopened in 1983 when a television docudrama gave the
credit to Cook. Then Rawlins raised fresh doubts, causing the
society to commission the foundation to study all the evidence anew.
   The foundation concluded that Peary's ``dead reckoning'' method
of navigation, corrected by observations of the position of the sun
every day at noon, was ``entirely adequate for polar latitudes.''
   And it found nothing sinister in some of Peary's behavior that
is often cited by doubters _ his depression after achieving a
lifetime goal, the fact that his diary entry, ``The Pole at
last!!!'' was written on a detached piece of paper and his coolness
toward Henson.
   Peary was withdrawn and despondent aboard the Roosevelt, but
that may have been because a member of the expedition, Professor
Ross Marvin of Cornell, had died on his trek back to the ship. Or
Peary may have been physically and emotionally exhausted, the
scientists said.
   He may have been irked with Henson, who had reached the location
of their North Pole camp first and thus claimed to be ``the first
man to sit on top of the world.''
   His diary was never intended for public inspection, so the
detached conclusion was of no importance, the report said.
   ``We feel that we can say categorically that Peary realized his
lifelong goal of attaining the pole on the last of his many
expeditions,'' the report said. ``Certainly we turned up no
evidence to the contrary.''

   It's a dilemma more people probably wish
they faced: whether to take the $30,000-a-year public-service post
or the $70,000 job in a comfortable office.
   It's apparently a big problem for students at elite law schools.
   When Harvard Law School's new dean did away with a counseling
position that offered help for such crises of conscience, students
responded in a lawyerly manner.
   They filed documents _ letters of protest and petitions that the
office be reinstated.
   Experts say student reaction at Harvard highlights a nationwide
quandary among the best and brightest youth whose eagerness to take
low-paying public interest jobs runs up against the lure of money.
   ``What you're hearing is the lament of students who can't resist
temptation,'' said Harvard Law Professor Philip Heymann. He said
he's heard the cry for 15 years.
   ``Much of what these students are angry about is the greater
American society and economy _ and that Harvard simply does not try
to wrestle it to the ground and turn it into a different society
and a different economy.''
   Harvard Law School was the first to provide an adviser to help
students find scarce public interest work and fend off seduction by
big firms that aggressively recruit prospects such as Ted Bilich.
   When the 25-year-old from Hartford, Conn., graduates from
Harvard Law this spring he will owe his lenders $58,000.
   Does he take a job he badly wants with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency or join the private firm in Washington that badly
wants him? The bottom-line difference is $42,000 in annual salary.
   ``Trying to make my job choice, I've felt no support,'' Bilich
said. ``I have no one to help me deal with this. The overwhelming
sense (I get) is that the choice is easy: Go to the Washington law
firm.''
   Amy Ruth Tobol, a lawyer who provides public interest counseling
at New York University, said another part of the problem is in the
way lawyers are trained.
   ``Part of what happens at law school is that students are
socialized to enter the legal profession,'' she said. The law is
taught in the context of private practice. The skill to argue any
point of view is cultivated.
   ``You're taught to divorce your feelings from your logical and
analytical thinking abilities,'' she said. As a result, the
lawyer-in-training puts aside personal inclinations and moral
values.
   Part of the public interest counselor's job is to help students
keep those values, even if it means going against the crowd, family
pressure and a society that says status goes with money.
   Bilich was an organizer of the Emergency Coalition for Public
Interest Placement at Harvard that led the protests against Dean
Robert C. Clark's decision to abolish the public-interest counselor.
   The post was established in the late 1970s to help students tap
the network of increasingly scarce public interest jobs.
   Public interest law includes such areas as legal aid for the
poor, consumer advocacy, environment, and civil liberties, public
defenders, assistant district attorneys and congressional staff.
   While not all such jobs pay poorly, they tend to fall far short
of the $70,000 to $80,000 entry level salaries offered by some
firms.
   Law students became so distressed that in 1986 they established
the National Association for Public Interest Law, a resource center
in Washington, D.C.
   The anguish at Harvard is a reaction to a national problem among
law students who are inclined to altruism, said Michael
Caudell-Feagan, the organization's executive director.
   ``They really are sort of rebelling against the current
values,'' Caudell-Feagan said. ``They see these seductive jobs and
they want someone to say, `No, it's all right not to take them.'''
   Caudell-Feagan estimated that nationwide, 3 percent of law
graduates go into non-profit, public interest jobs, and another 10
percent go into government positions.
   According to Harvard records, 1 percent of last year's graduates
took public interest jobs.
   Joining the Harvard students in protest, lawyers and judges
wrote to Clark questioning the cut.
   The ex-counselor, Ron Fox, said Clark told him his job was cut
to save money.
   Clark did not return requests for comment, but has responded to
the complaints by pointing to a new $1.5 million endowment to
foster careers in public interest law.
   The school has programs to relieve students of their college
loans if they take low-paying public interest jobs and to support
them in public interest summertime work.

<HEAD>Foreign Investment Not Dangerous to US, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worries that foreigners are buying up America
are unfounded although foreign ownership of U.S. businesses
increased dramatically in the past decade, a Washington research
group says.
   Subsidiaries of foreign companies generally operate in the same
manner as U.S.-owned companies, the Institute for International
Economics reported in a study released Monday.
   The foreign firms generally paid wages comparable to those in
U.S.-owned businesses and invested about the same money in research
and development in this country, according to the study by Paul
Krugman, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and Edwin M. Graham, a business professor at Duke
University.
   The study argued that it would be a mistake for Congress to
change U.S. laws in an effort to block foreign investment,
especially given the fact that the United States depends on foreign
capital flows of $100 billion annually to finance its merchandise
trade deficits.
   ``I have deplored as loudly as anyone the fact that we are
having to attract $10 billion a month in foreign investment, but
the money is much more likely to stay put if it comes in as a
direct investment'' rather than as foreign investment in the stock
market or bond market, said C. Fred Bergsten, a former Treasury
Department official and the head of the institute.
   The institute's study said foreign firms accounted for 7 percent
of total U.S. employment in manufacturing in 1986, the most recent
year for which statistics were available. That compared to 21
percent in France, 14 percent in Britain and 13 percent in West
Germany.
   However, the researchers said that while Japanese companies are
investing heavily in the United States, foreign-controlled
companies account for just 1 percent of manufacturing employment in
Japan, a drop from 2 percent in 1977.
   The heavy purchases by foreigners, in particular the Japanese,
have aroused concern in Congress and elsewhere that the United
States is selling its economic destiny to foreigners.
   Foreign direct investment totaled 8.9 percent of all
non-financial corporations in the United States in 1988, up from
2.1 percent in 1977, according to the Commerce Department.
   Rudy Oswald, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, said the institute
was wrong to conclude that foreign investment is basically a benign
influence on the U.S. economy.
   ``The United States is losing control of its own economic
destiny in many ways,'' Oswald said. ``It means that investment
decisions are being made not in terms of what is necessarily good
for a U.S. firm but what is in the worldwide plan of a foreign
firm.''
   The Commerce Department said foreign direct investment in U.S.
real estate and businesses totaled $328.9 billion in 1988, compared
with $326.9 billion in U.S. ownership overseas. That was the first
year that foreign direct ownership in the United States surpassed
American investment abroad.
   Britain has the largest stake in the United States, holding 31
percent of total foreign-held assets, while Japan climbed to the
No. 2 spot with 16.2 percent of the total, ahead of the
Netherlands, which held 14.9 percent.
   Purchases of prime real estate and Hollywood movie studios by
the Japanese grabbed the headlines, but the most dramatic inroads
by the Japanese have come in banking, according to the institute's
study.
   It reported that the Japanese in 1988 controlled 52.2 percent of
the U.S. banking assets held by foreign banks, far ahead of the
second biggest foreign holder, Canada, which controls 7.1 percent.
   In all, foreign banks controlled 19.2 percent of total American
banking assets in 1988, up from 8 percent a decade earlier.
   The Institute for International Economics is a non-profit
research institute created in 1981. It receives funding from the
German Marshall Fund of the United States, an independent endowment
created by the West German government, and various U.S.
corporations, including the Ford Foundation.

<HEAD>Former Pentagon Contracting Official Testifies in Bribery Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Marine Corps contracting
official says he solicited more than $80,000 in bribes to steer
business to a defense firm and stashed some of the proceeds at home
in his freezer.
   ``I put it in the freezer, in aluminum foil,'' Jack A. Sherman
testified Monday at the trial of two men accused of paying him
bribes.
   Sherman, a former civilian Marine Corps contracting official,
testified that he hid the cash in the freezer so his wife wouldn't
find it.
   ``I put it under the ice cubes ... It wasn't a large stack,''
Sherman told jurors.
   Sherman, who is serving 18 months following his guilty plea to
bribery charges, said the rest of the money was placed in a credit
union account.
   The former Pentagon official described how he negotiated with
Lee Telecommunications to receive the bribes. In return, Sherman
said he approved the contract and later increased its value to give
Lee more work at a time when it was struggling financially.
   His testimony came at the federal court trial of former Lee vice
president Leonard L. Ingram and Thomas Muldoon. The two are accused
of participating in a six-year bribery scheme that prosecutors said
funneled more than $80,000 to Sherman.
   Ingram's attorney, Marcus Topel, told jurors in his opening
statement that his client protested the bribe arrangements to
company vice president Scott Lamberth and was told ``to mind his
own business.''
   ``He is an innocent man who was in the wrong place at the wrong
time,'' Topel said.
   Two former Lee executives, including Lamberth, have pleaded
guilty to participating in the scheme along with a subsidiary of
the Whittaker Corp., which absorbed Lee in 1986.
   ``Was the money paid in cash or checks?'' asked prosecutor Jack
Hanley.
   ``It was always in cash,'' Sherman replied. ``In most cases I
was paid in the car, riding around the block.''
   He said he first began taking illegal gratuities in 1974 and
received his first bribe _ $800 _ in the late 1970s.
   Sherman said he discussed with Lamberth the possibility of
helping Lee get a contract in 1981.
   ``Mr. Lamberth said if the contract could be expedited, he would
be able to pay me $75,000. The money would be paid to a consultant
I knew, Tom Muldoon,'' Sherman said.
   Lamberth also promised a $10,000 bonus if the contract was
signed by a certain date, Sherman testified.
   Sherman said he and Muldoon originally agreed to evenly split
the money from Lee. But later, Muldoon complained that he needed a
larger share to pay taxes, so Sherman said he took only one-third.
   Sherman could not recall all the payments he received but
testified that he was paid about $25,000 from Muldoon. He also
arranged to be paid $800 a month by Lee through John Marlowe,
another defense consultant, from fall 1985 to mid-1987.
   Sherman said he couldn't recall doing anything specific for the
money. Those payments were made ``to keep me interested in looking
out for the best interests of the company,'' he said.
   Sherman said he later arranged to split 5 percent of the value
of a $1 million contract he steered to Lee with defense consultant
Donald Illeman, who also has pleaded guilty.
   While he usually dealt with Lamberth, who once paid him $4,800,
Sherman said he once discussed bribes with Ingram.
   Sherman said he called Ingram after Lee's estimate of the
contract's cost abruptly went from $1 million to $1.6 million.
   Sherman admitted to defense attorney Albert Ahern that even
after talking to the FBI when the investigation became public in
June 1988, he attempted to collect bribe money from Illeman.
   Sherman said Illeman still owed him $4,000.
   ``You were so greedy you wanted to get that money?'' Ahern said.
   ``Yes,'' Sherman said.
   ``You weren't full of contrition then?'' Ahern said.
   ``I was, but I made the call,'' Sherman said.

   The dollar moved slightly lower against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo Tuesday, while stock prices rose moderately.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues gained 50.86 points, or 0.13 percent, ending
trading at 37,803.53. The index had gained 28.61 points on Monday.
   The dollar closed at 144.47 yen, down 0.18 yen from Monday's
close of 144.65 yen. The U.S. currency opened at 144.41 yen and
ranged between 144.40 and 144.58 yen.
   After opening lower in Tokyo, the dollar moved narrowly as
market players were wary of central bank intervention, said a Bank
of Tokyo trader.
   The Bank of Japan sold dollars around 144.50 yen shortly after
Tokyo dealings opened, but the sale had no major impact on exchange
rate movements or the tone of trading, the trader said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Central bank intervention was not observed after the early move,
which made market players reluctant to buy more dollars, the trader
said.
   In the United States overnight, the Federal Reserve Board sold
dollars to stem the currency's rise against the yen.
   On the stock exchange, trading was active as market players
bought issues related to natural resources, including petroleum,
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a Daiwa Securities dealer.
   ``Market players were getting reassured as the yen was at least
a bit stronger than it was yesterday,'' he said.

   The state transport company,
which handles rail and operations nationwide, has fired 2,641
workers and threatened to dismiss thousands more unless a
6-week-old strike ends.
   Counting Monday's dismissals, management of the South African
Transportation Services has fired more than 11,000 of the 16,000
workers who walked out in a wage dispute on Nov. 2. Virtually all
of them are black.
   The workers want the minimum monthly wage increased from $225 to
$560. The strikers also are demanding the company formally
recognize their union, the South African Railway and Harbor Workers
Union.
   Management has refused to enter wage talks, saying a pay hike
was negotiated earlier this year.
   Whites employed by the 170,000-worker company make significantly
more money for the most part and dominate administrative and
supervisory posts.
   At least four people have been killed in strike-related violence
and there have been several arson and sabotage attacks that the
company has blamed on strikers. Police said a 10-car train derailed
Sunday night in Natal Province, the second such incident in four
days.
   Police and the company said the rail lines had been tampered
with.
   Company officials say damage to property during the strike
exceeds $8 million. But they say their rail and harbor operations
have not been seriously affected by the walkout, which is illegal
under legislation that bars strikes against essential services.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras stalked out of a Central American summit Monday after a
dispute with Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega.
   But a Costa Rican official said the two Central American leaders
resolved the dispute and Azcona agreed to return to the gathering,
which dealt with the region's fragile peace process.
   Azcona's spokesman, Marco Tulio Romero, said the president
walked out because Nicaragua refused to promise to drop its case
against Honduras in the World Court in The Hague.
   Nicaragua has a case pending against Honduras for harboring
U.S.-backed Contra rebels. Romero said Honduras has taken steps
toward dismantling the Contras and feels Nicaragua should respond
by dropping the suit.
   After more than three hours, Ortega agreed to suspend the case
for six months and Azcona said he would return to the meeting,
according to the Costa Rican information minister, Jorge Urbina.
   ``There has never been a summit like this, such a climate of
confrontation,'' Urbana said.
   Earlier, sources close to the talks said the five presidents
hoped to reach an agreement that would keep the peace process
alive, even if the agreement did not resolve the conflicts.
   Sources in the Nicaraguan, Salvadoran and Costa Rican
delegations, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said an
agreement to keep the 28-month-old peace process going was likely.
The agreement might include a call for more U.N. involvement, they
said.
   Another factor was the roles the Kremlin and Washington can play
in achieving a peaceful solution, a subject mentioned at the Mass.
   ``We know it does not depend on such distinguished citizens to
bring us peace in Central America,'' the Rev. Leonel Chacon told
the presidents attended by the presidents. ``There are others and
we ask them also in the name of God almighty to give us peace.''
   Hundreds jammed the parish church in Coronado, a San Jose
suburb. They clapped and cheered as presidents Ortega; Oscar Arias
of Costa Rica; Azcona; Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador and Vinicio
Cerezo of Guatemala entered.
   In a message to Arias on Monday, Pope John Paul II noted the
summit comes ``during a time of new tensions and painful
conflicts'' in Central America and said: ``I wish to express my
fervent hope that this meeting, through a sincere and constructive
dialogue, contributes to rediscovering the road of peace.''
   The five presidents met in a long session Monday to work out a
final document based on at least three draft proposals, the sources
said.
   The presidents discussed a proposal to ask the United States to
halt all aid to Contras fighting the leftist Sandinista government
in Nicaragua, the sources said. Cuba and the Soviet Union would be
asked to halt intervention in Central America.
   Some sources said the Nicaraguans were willing to accept a
loosely worded document implying they would not provide military
aid to the Salvadoran rebels, but an end to U.S. non-lethal aid to
the Contras was considered unlikely.
   The Salvadorans were discussing an agreement to work out a
Christmas truce with the rebels in exchange for a statement by the
presidents criticizing the guerrillas for their bloody urban
offensive in San Salvador last month.
   The presidents agreed last August to disband the Contras by Dec.
5 in exchange for democratization and a Feb. 25 election in
Nicaragua, but the Contras defied the agreement. They were once
again unrepresented, as was El Salvador's rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, known as FMLN.
   Momentum toward peace has slowed since October, with fighting
renewed in both El Salvador and Nicaragua, a suspension of
diplomatic relations between the two countries and increasing
campaign violence in Nicaragua.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria of El Salvador told The
Associated Press his nation was willing to re-establish normal
relations, suspended after a Nicaraguan-registered plane loaded
with weapons for the FMLN crashed Nov. 26 in El Salvador.
   Nicaragua is demanding that the Contras be demobilized by
Honduras or through a reinforced U.N. force. Honduras says it wants
to disband the force camped in its territory, but won't use its
army or shed Honduran blood to do it.
   A United Nations observer group was sent to verify the peaceful
repatriation of the Contras to Nicaragua and make sure no weapons
were sent from one country to another to help insurgent groups.
   The Contras say no guarantees of democracy or freedom exist for
them inside Nicaragua and their presence is the only guarantee the
Feb. 25 vote will be fair.
   Costa Rica proposed a cease-fire in El Salvador, with U.N.
verification, and Guatemala suggested the United States, Cuba and
the Soviet Union be asked to stop any kind of interference in the
region as a contribution to the peace process.
   The regional summit opened Sunday.

   Elections next February in Nicaragua will be
dismissed as illegitimate if violence against the country's
political opposition continues, according to a State Department
spokesman.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government ``is at a
crossroads,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.
   His comments were triggered by a Sunday rally by the opposition
coalition UNO at Masatepe, 30 miles south of Managua, which turned
into a machete-slashing riot that left one dead and more than 20
injured. Foreign observers blamed Sandinista sympathizers for the
violence.
   The opposition, a coalition of more than a dozen parties, is
promoting publisher Violeta Chamorro as its candidate to replace
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega as president in elections set for
Feb. 25.
   At the State Department, Boucher called it ``the latest in a
string of Sandinista-sponsored attacks on Nicaragua's internal
opposition'' since a cease-fire with the Contra rebels was lifted
Nov. 1.

<HEAD>Skinner: New Restrictions on Alcohol Advertising May Be Considered</HEAD>

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
new restrictions on alcohol advertising may be necessary for the
ongoing effort to keep intoxicated drivers off the road.
   At a White House briefing Monday for 150 anti-drunken driving
activists, President Bush called drunken driving ``one of the most
deadly scourges'' of our times and signed legislation declaring
this National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week.
   Before Bush spoke, Skinner was asked why the government does not
raise excise taxes on alcohol to discourage drinking and does not
restrict brewers' and liquor manufacturers' ads.
   ``I'm not so sure it isn't time to revisit those issues'' of
regulating advertising, Skinner said. People are ``not going to
stop drinking,'' he said, but they must be stopped ``from getting
behind the steering wheel.''
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan was more direct, telling the
briefing that the nation should ``consider some form of
restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic beverages.''

   The National Endowment for the Arts has
awarded $14 million in grants to institutions across the country in
an effort to generate more than $50 million in additional matching

   Four $1 million ``challenge grants'' were awarded Monday to
benefit Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., the San Francisco

   A former Bolivian interior minister who allegedly
hired Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie to teach torture techniques to
death squads arrived here to face drug charges after being spirited
out of his country.
   Luis Arce Gomez, known as the ``minister of cocaine'' in Bolivia
after he allegedly created an elite paramilitary squad to
confiscate cocaine from drug dealers who refused to pay him bribes,
landed in Miami on Monday night on a U.S. Drug Enforcement plane,
said Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian.
   Federal officials late Monday refused to comment about the
timing of his arraignment or any other details of his extradition.
The case was surrounded by tight security ordered from Washington,
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The arrest of Arce Gomez sends a message that the president
will work with other governments to pursue vigorously individuals
who traffic in drugs,'' the White House said in a statement.
   Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora said Arce Gomez was expelled
even though the two countries have no formal extradition treaty
because the United States was the first country to bring charges
against him.
   Arce Gomez's whereabouts were unknown until his capture Sunday
at a ranch near Santa Cruz, 350 miles east of the capital La Paz.
Clad in soccer shorts, he offered no resistance when hundreds of
police officers converged on the ranch, where he was attending a
family party.
   ``We congratulate the government of Bolivia for the capture,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, one of five U.S. senators in La Paz
on a one-day visit when Arce Gomez was put on the plane.
   He was to be held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center south of Miami pending arraignment on a 1983
drug-trafficking indictment here, officials said.
   Arce Gomez, who had a reputation for personally torturing
political prisoners, became his nation's powerful minister of the
interior when he and Gen. Luis Garcia Mesa overthrew a civilian
government in 1980. The right-wing government allegedly was
financed by cocaine traffickers.
   Human rights groups say Arce Gomez directed Bolivian death
squads and hired Barbie to advise the country's paramilitary forces
how to torture. The forces murdered hundreds of journalists,
political and labor leaders and church officials, according to
human rights organziations.
   Barbie was later expelled to France, where he is serving a life
sentence for a conviction on crimes against humanity stemming from
his days as Gestapo chief in Lyon.
   Arce Gomez was removed as interior minister in 1981 under
pressure from the U.S. government. When Bolivia stripped him of his
citizenship in 1982, he fled to Argentina and was arrested under
the Miami indictment, but he was freed in December 1983 in the
final days of Argentina's military regime.
   The indictment accuses Arce Gomez, along with 18 other people
including his former top aide Rene Benitez, of running a drug
protection racket while he was interior minister. He is
specifically charged with two counts of conspiracy to import and
distribute cocaine to Florida. He faces a maximum of 30 years in
prison if convicted.
   DEA officials have said that Arce Gomez directed a multi-million
dollar cocaine trafficking empire, charging Bolivia's top five drug
traffickers $75,000 every two weeks in exchange for freedom to
export cocaine.
   Two of his lieutenants charged in the indictment once received
$1.5 million for cocaine that was confiscated by Bolivian
authorities and stored in bank vaults, according to the indictment.
   The indictment said Arce Gomez personally ordered it released.
   Also named in the indictment is Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 50, who
faces up to 30 years in prison and $50,000 in fines if convicted of
conspiracy to import, possess and distribute cocaine. She was
extradited from Colombia following Colombian President Virgilio
Barco's August crackdown against the cocaine cartels and remains
held without bond in Miami.

   A six-man ski and sled dog team messaged home
``Here we are. Horrah,'' after sliding to the bottom of the world,
the halfway point in their 4,000-mile attempt to make the first
unmechanized crossing of Antarctica.
   The team, led by Minnesotan Will Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne
of France, sent the misspelled message by satellite after arriving
at the South Pole at 2 p.m. EST Monday, a late spring day in the
Southern Hemisphere.
   ``We see it much as the first explorers did, from the ground,
step by step, fighting against its terrible elements and awed by
its magnificent beauty,'' the adventurers said about Antarctica in
a longer statement sent to the St. Paul headquarters two weeks ago
and read Monday at the U.S. Scott-Amundsen Scientific Research Base.
   Scientists gave the International Trans-Antarctica Expedition a
tour of the dome station, but little else was known about the
group's arrival, said Cathy de Moll from the expedition's St. Paul
headquarters.
   The group is the second to reach the South Pole by dogsled.
Roald Amundsen did it on Dec. 14, 1911. Steger, 45, made history
three years ago when he led a similar assault on the North Pole.
   The team plans to stay at the South Pole until Friday, but
hasn't specified why.
   ``We are surmising that they want to dry out their clothes and
make sure their dogs are in really top form before they cross the
Area of Inaccessibility,'' de Moll referring to a 850-mile void of
ice where neither radio nor airplane contact is guaranteed.
   The adventurers have traveled 1,992 miles from the tip of the
Antarctic Peninsula, where the trek began July 27.
   The goal is to reach Mirnyy, a Soviet science station on the
continent's Indian Ocean shore.
   The second half is expected to go faster, although part of it
includes an uphill stretch from 10,000 feet at the South Pole to
11,500 feet at Vostok. The team could experience temperatures as
low as minus 60 degrees.
   The expedition is making its $11 million, seven-month journey to
bring world attention to Antarctica and to demonstrate the power of
international cooperation.
   The adventurers directed a portion of their statement read
Monday at the pole to children. ``We say to you, `Take care of
this, your last great wilderness, as if it were your own garden.
For in this place will grow the peace and knowledge we will use in
order to survive.''
   The trek has been jeopardized somewhat by problems including
breakdowns in air support.
   At one point early in the expedition, two of the team's three
sleds were damaged in a crashing descent on ice, and at another
point, a French doctor had to descend into an ice crevasse to
rescue a stranded sled dog.
   But a statement Monday night from the St. Paul headquarters said
things were going better and the team was only 10 days behind
schedule. They hope to finish the expedition by March 1.

   A South American metals dealer was ordered
held without bail after pleading innocent to directing the
laundering of a half-billion dollars for a notorious Colombian
cocaine cartel.
   Raul Silvio Vivas of Argentina, who was extradited from Uruguay
despite escalating anti-extradition terrorism, is named in 26
counts contained in two federal indictments.
   The 39-year-old Vivas entered his pleas Monday before two judges
and listened through an interpreter as Assistant U.S. Attorney
Russell Hayman described the charges. Vivas is accused of being a
top member of the Medellin cartel's money-laundering operations.
   For at least two years beginning in 1985, he used his
money-changing house in Montevideo to launder cocaine profits from
the United States, disguising them by real or ``paper'' gold
transactions, Hayman told U.S. District Judge William D. Keller.
   ``There was about $250 million laundered in this manner,''
Hayman said. ``We have bank records supporting those figures.''
   A second indictment, to which Vivas pleaded innocent before
Judge Consuelo Marshall, alleges another $250 million was
laundered, Hayman said. He said he did not know why the FBI earlier
had said Vivas was involved in laundering $1 billion.
   Vivas' attorney, Martin L. Schmukler, suggested he might ask
that Vivas be tried separately from other defendants. All told, 32
people, many from Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, are named
in the indictments, along with one corporation.
   But Keller said he was unlikely to sever Vivas' case and told
Schmukler to return to his court today to consult with other
defense attorneys, who planned to ask that evidence from wiretaps
be thrown out. Keller tentatively set trial for Jan. 27.
   Vivas was arrested in February and had fought extradition since
March in a Uruguayan jail.
   Asked if Vivas had done business with the other defendants,
Schmukler said, ``If he did, they were professional dealings, not
criminal dealings.''
   Uruguayan national police turned Vivas over to FBI agents at a
naval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to California
that night.
   Just two days earlier, a bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers
killed dozens and wounded hundreds outside Colombia's police
intelligence headquarters. A group of drug lords calling themselves
``the Extraditables'' has been waging a campaign of bombings and
assassinations to force the government to end its war on the cartel.
   The U.S. indictment, issued in February, charges Vivas and the
others with carrying out the largest Colombian drug cartel money
laundering operation ever uncovered by American law enforcement
authorities. Several defendants already have pleaded guilty.

   Joseph J. Krajsa knows what's needed once
a non-communist government is installed in Czechoslovakia:
electronic equipment.
   ``Their biggest problem is communications. They need to
communicate with the rest of the world,'' said Krajsa, who with his
father, Joseph C. Krajsa, manages the communications arm of the
First Catholic Slovak Union of the United States and Canada.
   The union, known as Jednota, already has sent people to Europe
to arrange additional contacts and try to get issues of its weekly
newspaper into Czechoslovakia.
   The country _ one of those leading the way to Eastern Bloc
liberalization as its ruling Communist party gives up its monopoly
on power, is a union of two republics, one predominantly ethnic
Czech, the other Slovak.
   When the time is right, the 105,000-member American organization
may invest in the country to help start publishing enterprises and
send in up to 500,000 copies of its newspaper and Slovak history
and language books, the Krajsas said recently.
   ``They have no reference point,'' said the younger Krajsa, 42,
referring to the rigorous censorship and information blackout
imposed by the communist regime during the past 40 years.
   For example, one young worker at Jednota who recently emigrated
from Czechoslovakia didn't know who reformist party chief Alexander
Dubcek was until she arrived in this country. Dubcek was ousted
when his ``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed by a Soviet-led
invasion in 1968.
   ``We're seeing what we can do and how we can help educate their
people as fast as we can,'' the son said, adding that Jednota has
the computerized publishing equipment to quickly print materials in
the Slovak language.
   He said the United States should send Czechoslovakia facsimile
machines, computers and other information-age equipment the rest of
the world takes for granted.
   In addition, university chairs in English should be established
at Slovakian universities. A Slovak chair at the University of
Pittsburgh was recently established and its first project was a new
text to teach Slovak, the son said.
   With obvious pride, he noted that the popular uprising that took
``10 years in Poland and 10 weeks in Germany took 10 days in
Czechoslovakia.''
   The country, formed out of the wreckage of the Austro-Hungarian
empire after World War I, was considered the most democratic in
eastern Europe until a portion of it was surrendered to Hitler in
1938 and fell entirely to the Nazis soon afterward. Communists
overwhelmed a post-World War II coalition government in 1948.
   ``They're used to seeking freedom,'' said the elder Krajsa, 72,
who has worked for Jednota for 30 years.
   The newspaper and commercial printing division are located in a
modern building and warehouse on a hillside outside Middletown. The
union's headquarters is in Independence, Ohio, near Cleveland,
where the union was founded in 1890 by the Rev. Stephen Furdek from
eight independent Slovak Catholic societies and lodges.
   The younger Krajsa manages Jednota Press, the commercial
printing division. The father is editor of the 38,000-circulation
newspaper.
   Seeing their homeland move to the verge of new freedom, while
gratifying, is not surprising, the Krajsas said.
   ``History shows that it happens,'' the elder Krajsa said.
   Adds the son: ``I feel very excited for them.''

   A Soviet actress apparently defected after
performing in a children's troupe as part of an exchange program
with a local group, officials said.
   Larisa Firsova, a 24-year-old apprentice actress with the
Central Children's Theatre of Moscow, slipped out of her hotel room
early Monday and went to an FBI office, a Minneapolis theater
official said.
   She was discovered missing Monday as 34 members of her 46-member
troupe assembled at their hotel to head for the airport to go home,
said Bill Conner, executive director of the Children's Theater
Company of Minneapolis.
   FBI spokesman Byron Gigler said Firsova has been transferred to
the custody of officials at the district office of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service in St. Paul.
   An INS official declined comment. ``We won't confirm or deny
anything,'' said Thomas Schiltgen, acting district director. The
INS does not disclose any information about individuals seeking
asylum in this country, he said.
   ``We have no sense of what her status is,'' Conner said. He said
he could assume only that Firsova had defected.
   Conner said Firsova had appeared to be happy. The actress had
one of the chorus roles in ``Dream To Be Continued,'' which
finished its eighth performance Sunday at the World Theater in St.
Paul. She has a husband in Moscow, he said.
   She was not among the troupe's top actors, said Alexi Borodin,
the Moscow company's artistic director.
   ``She has a nice appearance, and we needed someone who could
dance, and that is the most that could be said about her,'' he said.
   Firsova speaks little or no English and is trained principally
as an actor, rather than a dancer.
   The 34 troupe members returned home as planned Monday. The
remaining 11 plan to stay a few more days to work on a play that
Borodin plans to direct in Minneapolis this summer, Conner said.

   A $65 million navigation satellite
was rocketed into orbit, joining the Air Force's network of
spacecraft that guide bombers, warships, missiles and ground troops
with precision accuracy.
   The fifth of a series of Navstar spacecraft was boosted into
space Monday by a Delta 2 rocket. The satellite settled into an
orbit reaching 11,000 miles high.
   ``Everything appears to have gone very well with the flight,''
said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.
   After about a month of checkout by ground stations, the new
Navstar will join the four earlier spacecraft in providing U.S. and
allied military units information that allows them to pinpoint
their locations within 50 feet anywhere on Earth in any weather.
   Planes, ships, submarines, tanks and field soldiers can tune in
on the network's positioning radio signals with receivers as small
as a hand-held telephone. In some places the signals can be
accurate within 10 feet.
   The 3,675-pound satellites also keep track of the speed of
military vehicles within a fraction of a mile per hour and tell
them the time, accurate to within a millionth of a second.
   Military users receive information from a coded channel.
Civilian users such as operators of boats and private aircraft also
have access to the system, but they monitor an open channel
providing less accurate information, to within 300 feet of their
position.
   Users must wait until one or more of the satellites is within
radio range, leaving occasional gaps in coverage. There will be no
interruption when the Air Force completes the 21-satellite network
by 1992. Launches are planned about once every two months.

<TEXT>
   Lindsay Crosby, son of the late entertainer
Bing Crosby, was found dead in his suburban home in an apparent
suicide. He was 51.
   Crosby, whose body was found Monday afternoon, died after
apparently shooting himself in the head, authorities said.
   An autopsy was scheduled for today.
   A friend discovered the body on a bedroom floor in the home in
Calabasas; a small-caliber rifle was found nearby, said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Deputy Bill Linnemeyer.
   Lindsay Crosby was the youngest of four brothers born to Bing
and Dixie Lee Crosby. Dixie Lee, whose real name was Wilma Wyatt,
died of cancer in 1952.
   Bing Crosby died at 73 of a heart attack in 1977.
   Lindsay Crosby was married three times, to dancer Barbara
Frederickson, secretary Janey Schwartz and most recently to former
Miss Alaska Susan Marlin, and had four sons. He and Miss Marlin
separated in the late 1970s.
   Lindsay and brothers Gary, Phillip and Dennis once formed a
nightclub act, the Crosby Boys, that ran until 1959. Lindsay then
went to work reading scripts for his father.
   Lindsay took a tempered view of revelations in brother Gary's
1983 book, ``Going My Own Way,'' which portrayed Bing Crosby as a
stern disciplinarian, but he said he supported publication of
Gary's book.
   ``I never expected affection from my father so it didn't bother
me,'' he said in an interview.

   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, whose sermon was
disrupted by abortion-rights and AIDS activists inside St.
Patrick's Cathedral, said demonstrators would halt services ``over
my dead body.''
   City officials also denounced the activists, who sprawled in the
aisles of the cathedral during Sunday Mass. Some of the
demonstrators chained themselves to pews or hurled condoms. One
threw a Communion wafer on the floor.
   ``If their aim is to change church teaching, they can't
accomplish that,'' O'Connor said Monday.
   About 4,500 marched outside, protesting the Roman Catholic
Church's policies on AIDS, abortion, contraception and
homosexuality, and 111 were arrested, 43 inside the church.
   Mayor Edward Koch, mayor-elect David Dinkins and Gov. Mario
Cuomo were among those calling the demonstration inside the
cathedral an affront to religion and an infringement on worshipers'
First Amendment rights.
   Koch, who attended the Mass to demonstrate his support though he
is Jewish, said: ``To think that you're going to change the beliefs
of the Catholic church by disrupting a service makes no sense and
it is not acceptable. It doesn't come in under any protected First
Amendment rights.''
   Said Dinkins: ``A peaceful demonstration, an expression of one's
views, is one thing, but one ought not disrupt a religious
ceremony.''
   Cuomo, while noting ``terrible anguish of AIDS'' and the
``complex and emotional'' debate on abortion, said: ``Even the
awful provocation emanating from these issues does not justify the
outrage of desecrating, egregiously, a religious service and its
worshipers.''
   The protest was organized by two groups known for vocal
demonstrations, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (Act-Up) and
Women's Health Action and Mobilization (Wham!).
   O'Connor called the demonstration the worst of many he had seen
at the cathedral.
   ``They will stop the Mass over my dead body,'' he said.
   ``I can't imagine a day that the church will change its position
on contraception,'' O'Connor said. ``The church will certainly not
change its position on homosexual behavior. It will not change its
position on abortion.''
   Even some of the protesters said those inside St. Patrick's went
too far.
   John Kelly, a spokesman for Act-Up, acknowledged that ``a lot in
the group were disturbed by what went on (inside the cathedral).
But that's their right to protest.''
   ``We weren't attempting in any way to change the church's
teaching,'' Kelly said. ``But (O'Connor is) taking church teaching
and forcing it on the people of New York City who don't necessarily
share his beliefs.''
   He said the church's attitude fostered ignorance about AIDS.
   Andy Humm, spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay
Rights, said the 50-group coalition supported the protest outdoors,
but ``unequivocably condemned'' the splinter group inside St.
Patrick's.
   Humm said the cardinal's position on AIDS education and abortion
``must be protested vigorously, but that does not excuse the
violation of anyone's right to pray as they choose.''

   The leader of a violent drug gang was convicted
of ordering the murder of a rookie police officer whose badge is
kept by President Bush as a symbol of the war on illegal drugs.
   Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, who commands a crack gang called the
Bebos, was found guilty by a federal jury Monday of all 11 counts,
including murder, conspiracy, racketeering and possessing and
distrubuting drugs. He faces a mandatory term of life in prison
without parole for the death of Officer Edward Byrne, 22.
   At the verdict, tears welled in the eyes of Byrne's father,
Matthew, who gave his slain son's police shield to
then-presidential candidate George Bush after the Feb. 26, 1988,
slaying. The president keeps the badge in his Oval Office desk as a
reminder of the perils of the drug war.
   Mason, who boycotted the trial, appeared unmoved as he watched
the verdict announced on closed-circuit television from a holding
cell, said Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Pizzi.
   ``He didn't flinch; he just sat there,'' Pizzi said.
   Matthew Byrne and his wife, Ann, left the courthouse without
comment after thanking prosecutors.
   Byrne was shot five times in the head as he sat in a car
guarding the home of a witness in a drug case.
   Prosecutors said Mason ordered the attack to solidify his
position of leadership of the Bebos. Four members of the gang were
convicted earlier this year in state court of carrying out the
killing, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
   ``I hope this sends a message to people who are willing to give
the orders that there is a high price to pay,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Leslie R. Caldwell.
   Testimony during the trial of the four killers said the order to
kill came from Mason's cell at the Brooklyn House of Detention. He
had been convicted on a weapons charge and jailed two days before
the slaying.
   The prosecution's key witness against Mason, Viola Nichols, told
the jury he had directed the murder because another patrolman had
``disrespected'' him in front of his colleagues by upbraiding him
for drinking beer in public. Her brother, Lorenzo ``Fat Cat''
Nichols, was one of the four already convicted.
   Defense lawyer Harry C. Batchelder Jr. asked Judge Edward R.
Korman to set the verdict aside, saying Mason was mentally
incompetent to participate in his two-week trial. Korman denied the
motion on 10 of the counts but reserved decision on the the murder
charge.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Rescuers Challenge Human Limitations and the Sea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The image that lingers is of flares _ five of them
were spotted during the Coast Guard's search for five lobstermen _
that came and went like shooting stars.
   The rescuers, who gave up their search after 11 days, are now
haunted by the reminder that out on the sea ``it's just you and the
will to live.''
   Each flare sighting raised hopes that turned to frustration as
hundreds of searchers scanned thousands of miles of ocean without
success. When the search for the Stonington, Conn.-based, Heidi
Marie was finally suspended Dec. 1, disappointment and questions
about the failed effort remained.
   ``It's not as easy as seeing a flare and then finding it,'' said
Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Stickney, one of the pilots who logged
hours in the air during the search.
   ``You turn the plane in that direction but you really have no
idea how far away it is,'' he said. ``You only see the flare
momentarily, almost like ... if you were in your car and saw
lightning in the distance.''
   With every passing hour, the odds against finding survivors grew
slimmer.
   ``You just feel this incredible pressure because you're trying
constantly to get caught up with the situation because the search
area grows larger and larger, the potential drift areas grow and
the information going into designing the mission grows,'' Stickney
said.
   During the height of the search, Stickney spent his on-duty
hours absorbed in mathematics and probabilities. He and his flight
crew focused solely on resisting the lull of mile after mile of
greenish-gray sea and preventing their vision from blurring before
an endless stretch of horizon.
   ``You're right on the edge and you just keep thinking `I've got
to stay alert, I've got to concentrate,' because the next time you
glance left you could spot a life raft,'' Stickney said.
   But sometimes the fates conspire against Coast Guard missions.
Turbulent air jostles planes or 20-foot seas and wind-whipped water
obscure the view. Sometimes, as was the case with the Heidi Marie,
what seems a hot trail suddenly turns cold.
   The search planes are equipped with high-tech radar, infrared
heat-detecting sensors and data marker buoys to track conditions at
sea. But mostly the rescuers rely on their eyes, pilots scanning
from the cockpit and observers peering through 3-foot windows.
   Their backs get sore and their eyes strain against
late-afternoon shadows and hours of staring into the glare of
clouds, then snow, then brilliant blue sky.
   Because the Heidi Marie's life raft was made of cloth, it was
undetectable on radar. Because it was so small, their field of
vision was limited to about a mile off either wing.
   The weight of constant risk also tires Coast Guard searchers.
   ``The only thing separating us, the searchers, from them, the
people in the raft, is a few hundred feet of water,'' Stickney
said. ``It could be us lost out there and it could be our wives
waiting for the phone to ring.''
   The five missing lobstermen's families are no longer waiting.
The days and nights of waiting are over.
   The rescuers now live with the imagined faces of unknown sailors.
   ``It isn't a pretty picture to think of what they were going
through,'' said Lt. Bennett Bonomi, a pilot who was among those
searching for the Heidi Marie. ``The sea is so big ... and you're
at the mercy of the elements. It's just you and the will to live.''

<TEXT>
   Negotiators have picked an isolated site to
trade the kidnapp;ed daughter of a senior Cabinet minister for
jailed Moslem militants, a top state official said today.
   Disagreements over the site of the exchange had stalled the
exchange and an end to the kidnapping, the first crisis for the
10-day-old government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Chief Secretary Moosa Raza, the top-ranking bureaucrat in
Jammu-Kashmir state, said negotiators for the government and the
militant Kashmir Liberation Front at midday finally resolved
differences and agreed to an isolated site.
   He declined to give specifics, but said the exchange could take
place at ``any moment.''
   Militants have demanded freedom for five to eight militants
being held in prisons in exchange for Rubaiya Sayeed, the
22-year-old daughter of Home Minister Mufti Homahhad Sayeed.
   Ms. Sayeed, a medical intern, was abducted at gunpoint on Friday
in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. Srinagar is
about 95 miles north of Jammu, the state's winter capital.
   The front was formed in 1965 and is demanding that
Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority, either
become independent or part of neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic
nation.
   As negotiations continued, the government moved three of the
militants from a Jammu jail to Srinagar.
   The Kashmir Liberation Front is demanding the release of Abdul
Hamid Sheikh, the group's top leader who was arrested last month
after being wounded in a clash with police. He is in a Srinagar
hospital.
   But Sheikh asked relatives to tell the government he did not
want to be part of any deal, police sources said. Sheikh said the
government, once certain Ms. Sayeed was safe, would only arrest him
again, the sources said.
   The other militants are Noor Mohammed Kalwal, Mohammed Altaf,
Javed Ahmed Zargar, Sher Mohammed Azad and Ghulam Nabi Butt. The
name of the seventh militant was not immediately known.
   All have been arrested during the past year and are suspected of
subversive and secessionist activities, although none have been
charged.
   Ms. Sayeed's abduction occurred three days after her father was
appointed home minister, a key post that oversees the country's
internal security.
   He is the first Moslem to hold the job. The appointment was seen
as a part of Prime Minister V.P. Singh's efforts to appease Moslems
who have borne the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots this fall.
   The kidnapping came a day after Sayeed was appointed the head of
a government committee set up to try to end separatist campaigns in
Jammu-Kashmir and neighboring Punjab, where Sikh militants are
demanding an independent nation.
   Moslems make up 64 percent of the state but nationwide comprise
only 11 percent of the population. Hindus comprise 80 percent of
India's 880 million people.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.

   A valedictorian who married instead of
using a scholarship that was good at any college in the state
surprised Gustavus Adolphus College officials recently when she
showed them the 1953 certificate.
   They didn't know anything about it, but decided to honor it.
   Lois Kirschstein married her high school sweetheart, Elmer
Kirschstein, after graduating as valedictorian at St. Peter High
School.
   ``It drove the high school teachers and the principal nuts,''
Kirschstein said. ``I wasn't supposed to do that. But I never
regretted I did.''
   Her husband died last summer, and the 54-year-old Kirschstein
began searching for something to do with her life. The search
crystallized when she found the faded scholarship certificate.
There was no expiration date, so she decided to try and put it to
use at Gustavus.
   ``At first (college officials) told me it was no good, even if
there was no expiration date, it was only good in the year I
applied for it,'' said Kirschstein, a grandmother of 10 who lives
in the south-central Minnesota town of Morgan. ``I told them that I
never applied, it was a gift. So I sent a copy of it to the
college.''
   ``We had never seen one of these,'' said Owen Sammelson, vice
president for administration. ``But we talked it over, and since
there was no date we decided to accept it. We are delighted that
she's doing this.''
   Mark Anderson, director of admissions, said the college has
waived its requirement for standardized college entrance exams.
   ``She is a top-notch student, and I am sure she will enrich any
classroom,'' Anderson said. ``I saw her transcript, and there
wasn't a B on there. It was straight A's.''
   Kirschstein plans to major in history and religion at Gustavus.
   This year tuition at Gustavus is about $10,300. Kirschstein's
scholarship will cover $5,150. In 1953, the scholarship's cash
value would have been only $225, half of the college's $450 annual
tuition.
   Kirschstein chose Gustavus because of its Lutheran roots and its
proximity to her home. She plans to rent a small apartment in St.
Peter, which is 50 miles east of Morgan, and go home on weekends.
   After raising four children, Kirschstein isn't worried about
communicating with the other freshmen, but she is nervous.
   ``I'm scared to death,'' Kirschstein said. ``I don't know, I may
go a semester and think this is just nuts. But I don't think God is
done with me yet, and this seems like a good place to find out
what's in store.''

   A woman who underwent the world's first
heart-liver-kidney transplant was placed back on a ventilator after
developing inflammation of her pancreas.
   Cindy Martin, 26, of Archbald, remained in critical condition
early today at Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   Her condition had been listed as serious during the weekend,
before the inflammation developed.
   The pancreas is a gland that secretes a digestive juice into the
small intestine. Doctors believe the inflammation is related to the
Dec. 3 transplant operation, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said.
   Doctors said Mrs. Martin's transplanted organs were functioning
well, however.
   ``It is a temporary setback, but it seems to be getting
better,'' Ms. Rossi said. ``There is concern another infection
might develop.''
   Mrs. Martin had undergone a heart transplant in 1985, but
suffered chronic rejection and eventually developed hepatitis and
kidney dysfunction.
   She suffered from an inherited heart disease.

   A man authorities say stalked Johnny
Carson for two years pleaded innocent to charges of sending tapes
and letters threatening to kill the talk show host unless he paid
him $5 million.
   Ken Orville Gause of Milwaukee entered the plea Monday in
Municipal Court to one felony count each of making terrorist
threats and sending threatening letters. He was held in lieu of
$250,000 bail pending a preliminary hearing Thursday.
   Gause, 36, was arrested Dec. 5 in the lobby of KNBC-TV studios
two hours before the taping of ``The Tonight Show.'' Authorities
said he was carrying a sock filled with gravel but never got close
enough to Carson to hurt him.
   Gause had threatened Carson in letters and tape recordings for
the past two years and had the celebrity's address in his
possession when he was taken into custody, authorities said.
   He could be sentenced to seven years in prison if convicted on
both counts.

<TEXT>
   A spotlight searches the big city skyline as a
high-powered jazz prelude, including some fine scat singing, fills
the theater. Then gun shots and sirens. Finally, the tough-guy
monotone of a private detective right out of Raymond Chandler or
Dashiell Hammett is heard.
   It's the opening of ``City of Angels,'' the hard-boiled, private
eye musical that barreled into Broadway's Virginia Theater on
Monday night. It's an ambitious show, even an innovative one, from
creators Cy Coleman, Larry Gelbart and David Zippel.
   That's not to say ``City of Angels'' is perfect. The evening
runs on too long, and the main character needs more definition _
and a little more heart. But you won't find a more original musical
on Broadway.
   The place is Los Angeles, the time the late 1940s. A
disillusioned Hollywood screenwriter named Stine would rather write
mystery novels about a fictional gumshoe named Stone than toil as a
hack for an unscrupulous movie producer. But he needs the money.
After all, Stine says, didn't Fitzgerald and Faulkner work in the
movies?
   But then, did their creations sing and dance? ``City of Angels''
brings Stine's fictional detective to life. The audience sees both
Stine's real life and the world he is forced to create for the
silver screen.
   Stine, played with nerdish charm by Gregg Edelman, has a
soulmate in Stone. James Naughton gives the show's best performance
as the rakish detective. ``You're nothing without me,'' the two men
sing together in one of the musical's more persistent melodies, and
the show confirms their dependence on each other.
   Gelbart has concocted an ingenious, often very funny book. It's
a split-level story that satirizes the world of Hollywood film
making as well as the heros and convoluted plots of detective
fiction.
   All the other major performers play two roles. Stine's
long-suffering wife (Kay McClelland) resembles a torch singer the
detective Stone desires. Stone's Gal Friday (Randy Graff) is
similiar to the woman who works for that big time movie producer
(Rene Auberjonois). The producer, in turn, also appears in even
more grotesque form as a character in Stine's movie script.
   Auberjonois gets most of Gelbart's best zingers as the
egomaniacal producer who wants to rewrite Stine's script, while
Graff and McClelland suffer beautifully in song.
   ``City of Angels'' is Coleman's most tightly constructed score,
a big improvement over his much more conventional melodies for last
season's flop ``Welcome to the Club.''
   The numbers, lushly orchestrated by Billy Byers, suggest the
1940s, from big ballad crooning like ``Stay With Me'' to a torch
number like ``With Every Breath I Take,'' to an old-fashioned
musical comedy song like ``You Can Always Count on Me.''
   Zippel's lyrics evoke the same period, lushly romantic in the
ballads and sharp and sassy in the comedy songs.
   Director Michael Blakemore and his production team _ set
designer Robin Wagner, costume designer Florence Klotz and lighting
designer Paul Gallo _ have separated the worlds ingeniously.
Stone's film world is black and white; Stine's real world is in
living color. And occasionally they collide, most effectively at
the end of the show on an impressive soundstage where reality and
fantasy merge. It's then that Stine the author decides to say
``no'' to what Hollywood is doing to Stone the detective.
   Like its hero, ``City of Angels'' takes a chance. From Coleman's
scintillating, thematically linked score to Gelbart's ingenious,
multi-layered story, the show doesn't play safe. And that's more
than you can say for most of the musicals in town.
   In other reviews:
   The New York Times' Frank Rich wondered: ``How long has it been
since a musical was brought to a halt by riotous jokes?'' He
praised Gelbart for his ``endlessly witty wordplay'' and composer
Coleman for ``a delirious celebration of jazz and pop styles.''
   The New York Post's Clive Barnes praised the cast as good and
said the play had ``taste, resonance and imagination.'' But, ``The
one thing it doesn't completely do is work. ... What we have here
are a bunch of ideas searching for fulfillment,'' he wrote.
   The Daily News' Howard Kissel said he ``didn't have a good
time'' at the ``contrived parody.''

<TEXT>
   Two Filipino dissidents slain in a Seattle union
hall would likely have been targets for monitoring or harrassment
by agents of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, a
Philippine congressman testified.
   Witness Bonifacio Gillego, who worked 20 years in Philippine
intelligence before retiring in 1960, testified Monday in a
wrongful-death lawsuit by the survivors of Silme Domingo and Gene
Viernes. The men, opponents of Marcos' regime, were shot to death
in offices of the Alaska Cannery Workers Union in June 1981.
   Three men were convicted of murder on the theory that Domingo
and Viernes were victims of an internal union dispute involving
work assignments and gambling in Alaska fish canneries.
   But the U.S. District Court lawsuit, which seeks $30 million,
accuses the late Philippine president, his widow, Imelda, and
others of orchestrating the deaths because of Domingo's and
Viernes' anti-Marcos activism.
   Gillego testified that the two men would have been tracked by
Marcos' intelligence agents in the United States.
   He said that generally, those agents' tactics ranged from
``gentle persuasion to ... action that would even include extreme
measures.''
   Asked if that included executions or ``disappearances'' of
anti-Marcos activists, Gillego replied, ``That is correct.''
   Gillego had been part of the anti-Marcos opposition keeping
track of Philippines intelligence activities, and lived underground
in the Philippines and in exile in the United States after Marcos
declared martial law in 1972.
   After Marcos was overthrown, he was named executive director of
President Corazon Aquino's Overseas Philippine Presidential
Commission on Good Government, which was charged with recovering
Marcos' wealth in the United States.
   Marcos attorney Richard Hibey objected to much of Gillego's
testimony as hearsay, since Gillego lacks personal knowledge about
the particular case. But Judge Barbara Rothstein allowed most
answers, as long as they were labeled as Gillego's expert opinion.
   Gillego testified about several documents seized from Philippine
government files after Marcos' overthrow in February 1986. He
described them as typical of the kind of intelligence reports
prepared by Philippine consulates in the United States and sent to
Manila.
   Domingo's name appeared in several documents, Gillego testified,
including one identifying him as Washington coordinator of the
anti-Marcos Union of Democratic Filipinos, Gillego said.
   Domingo's and Viernes' union was a local of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, which Gillego described as
a ``prime target'' of Marcos intelligence because its members had
been known to refuse to load or unload commodities from countries
whose politics they opposed.
   Their elections as union officers ``would be an important event
... that would be easily reported'' by Philippine intelligence
agents, he said.

   Maoist Shining Path rebels raided five Andean
villages and massacred 49 peasants, including 30 in one village
where the rebels herded people into the town square before opening
fire, police said.
   The attacks in Ayacucho province Sunday night and Monday where
among the Shining Path's deadliest since it launched its insurgency
in 1980. The raids came after the government _ for the first time _
supplied firearms to peasants to defend themselves.
   In Lima, a military court on Monday found two police officers
guilty of murder in the killings of up to 70 Shining Path inmates
after a prison riot was crushed by security forces in June 1986. It
cleared 76 other defendants.
   The court ruled that 60 to 70 of the 124 guerrilla prisoners
killed during rioting at the Lurigancho penitentiary in June 1986
were shot to death after they surrendered.
   A panel of three generals convicted police Col. Rolando Cabezas
and Lt. Javier Marquina. Cabezas was sentenced to 15 years in
prison and Marquina to seven years.
   Defense lawyers had argued that 76 other officers and troops
acted on orders of their superiors when they shot the prisoners.
   Early Monday, a rebel column of about 100 guerrillas attacked
four villages in the highlands around Ayacucho, 240 miles south of
Lima, and killed 38 peasants, police said. Another Shining Path
group of about 50 guerrillas killed 11 men in a raid on a town
Sunday night, police said.
   They gave this account:
   The bloodiest attack was on Paccha, a village 35 miles south of
Ayacucho. The raiders ordered most of the 800 residents into the
town square, read a ``blacklist'' of names and then killed 30
people, including several women.
   Shortly before, the rebels killed eight people in nearby
villages.
   The second rebel group attacked Vicus, a village 50 miles
northeast of Ayacucho, killed 11 men and burned down 15 houses.
   Among those kiled in Vicus was the leader of a recently
organized civil defense force, police said. The Shining Path
considers members of peasant defense forces traitors.
   On Friday, President Alan Garcia went to Ayacucho to present 200
shotguns to a civil defense organization in Rinconada Baja, a
village 25 miles from Vicus. It was the first time the government
has supplied firearms to peasant patrols, most of which are armed
with lances and machetes.
   The army has encouraged villagers to form civil defense groups,
but has been opposed to providing the volunteers with guns, fearing
the weapons would fall into the hands of the guerrillas.

   The brother-in-law of a former Mexican
president pleaded ``absolutely innocent'' to charges that he
plotted to torture and kill a U.S. drug agent.
   Speaking loudly, 59-year-old Ruben Zuno Arce entered the plea
Monday through an interpreter during an arraignment before U.S.
District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie.
   Zuno was charged with conspiring to kill DEA agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar in 1985 and other violations in an indictment that
said he is a member of a drug cartel.
   He took part in a meeting with the four other men during the
first week of February 1985, to discuss ``the kidnaping and
interrogation'' of Camarena, the indictment said.
   He was part of a plot to murder Camarena ``for the purpose of
maintaining and increasing'' trafficking in marijuana and cocaine,
the complaint said.
   The formal charges are conspiracy to knowingly and intentionally
kidnap, torture, interrogate and murder Camarena; aiding and
abetting in the kidnaping and murder of Camarena; conspiring to
kidnap an individual on account of the performance of his official
duties, and kidnaping based on the victim's official duties.
   If convicted, he faces a maximum of life in prison.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a co-defendant, is charged with the
felony murder of a federal agent, among other things.
   Zuno, a businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican
President Luis Echeverria, was arrested Saturday by DEA agents as
he got off a plane arriving from Mexico at Los Angeles
International Airport.
   Authorities believe Zuno was visiting Los Angeles to help his
attorneys prepare a defense for a related perjury trial slated to
begin this month, said DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge.
   On Feb. 7, 1985, Camarena was abducted by members of the
Guadalajara Narcotics Cartel, an organization that distributes tons
of marijuana and cocaine, the indictment said.
   From his abduction until Feb. 9, Camarena was interrogated by
drug overlord Rafael Caro Quintero and others, the indictment said.
   Zuno owned a house in Guadalajara, Mexico, that was sold to Caro
Quintero shortly before the slayings. The government alleges
Camarena was tortured and killed in the house.
   Camarena's severely beaten body and that of his pilot, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, were found March 5, 1985, in a remote area 70 miles
north of the city.
   The indictment said the cartel had at least 10 tons of marijuana
and an undisclosed amount of cocaine to distribute in 1984-1985.
Prosecutors allege the cartel's efforts to protect its operations
led to Camarena's death.
   The agents arresting Zuno were part of a task force set up in
1985 exclusively to investigate the slayings.
   Zuno first was arrested Aug. 9 in San Antonio, Texas, and
escorted to Los Angeles to testify before the grand jury probing
Camarena's slaying. He was released on $200,000 bail on the perjury
charge, which accuses him of lying when he told a federal grand
jury he didn't know two people connected to the killings.

   A fast-moving passenger train derailed
rounding a curve in eastern Bulgaria today, killing at least 15
people and injuring 100, state radio reported.
   The radio said the high speed could have been the cause of the
accident but said work was being done on the tracks and warning
signals had been set up near the accident site.
   It said the train, en route from Sofia to the port city of
Varna, was traveling at 60 mph when it headed into the curve near
the town of Romen, about 100 miles east of Sofia. The engine and
three passenger cars derailed.
   The report came only hours after the accident happened, in a
marked change from previous reporting when at least one day passed
before state media reported on such accidents.
   It said a commission had been set up to investigate the
accident. The report gave no further details.

<HEAD>NBC Will Have Special News Report With Drug Miniseries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NBC will air a special news report on the
1985 slaying of a U.S. drug agent following the first installment
of a miniseries on the case.
   Tom Brokaw will be host of the news special Jan. 7.
   ``There's no more important subject in America today than the
war on drugs,'' NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff told
NBC affiliate stations Monday. ``I think this miniseries will focus
that nation's attention on it. It will make an important
statement.''
   ``Drug Wars,'' a three-part, six-hour miniseries based on the
book ``Desperadoes'' by Elaine Shannon, is about the slaying of
Enrique Camarena of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Mexico
and the effort to bring his killers to justice.
   It stars Steven Bauer as Camarena, Elizabeth Pena as his wife,
and Craig T. Nelson and Treat Williams as drug agents.
   ``I don't think it's any different than when we did an AIDS
tie-in after `Early Frost' or a report on abortion after `Roe Vs.
Wade,''' Tartikoff said of the tie-in. ``I think viewers have a
clear idea of the separation of news and entertainment. I think it
will be controversial, but the controversy won't be over confusing
viewers.''
   Tartikoff also said ``Murder in Mississippi,'' based on the
slayings of three civil rights workers in 1964, will air Feb. 5,
and ``Grand,'' a half-hour comedy, will debut Jan. 18 after
``Cheers.'' It replaces ``Dear John,'' which moves to Wednesdays.
   Set in a Pennsylvania town, ``Grand'' is sort of a comedic
version of ``Upstairs, Downstairs.'' The show is from Carsey-Werner
Co., which also produces the Thursday night series ``The Cosby
Show'' and ``A Different World.''
   ``The time period was determined after we saw the pilot, which
is a different kind of show that needs some nurturing and is
deserving of special attention,'' Tartikoff said.

   The Soviet Parliament today rejected a bid by
reformers to follow several Eastern European countries and one
Soviet republic in striking the Communist Party's monopoly on power
from the constitution.
   The rebuff was a victory for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
wants the Congress of People's Deputies to focus on the nation's
severe economic problems.
   The Congress, on the first day of a 10-day session, refused to
include on its agenda a discussion of Article 6 of the
constitution, which calls the Communist Party ``the leading and
guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political
system.''
   But the vote, 1,139 to 839, indicated the idea has gained
strength among the deputies, who were elected in March. Fifty-six
abstained.
   Poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, supporting a move by deputies from the
Baltic republics and the reformist Inter-Regional Deputies Group,
said: ``Authority must not be only written into one paragraph, but
proven every day.''
   He later called the vote a ``noble defeat'' since 87 percent of
the Congress deputies are party members. ``We got 839 votes,''
Yevtushenko said. ``I didn't expect that.''
   The Baltic republic of Lithuania last week became the first of
the Soviet Union's 15 republics to replace Article 6 with one that
allows a multiparty system.
   As changes sweep Eastern Europe, partly at Gorbachev's behest,
Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia have ended the Communist
monopoly on power, and Poland selected the East bloc's first
non-Communist prime minister. On Monday, Bulgaria's leadership
proposed a multiparty system.
   Gorbachev said any issue was open to debate, but warned against
thinking that eliminating Article 6 would solve all the country's
troubles.
   ``We cannot start political speculation,'' he said.
   He urged the Congress instead to concentrate on a government
plan to straighten out the country's economic mess, which was to be
presented later by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   ``We need drastic reforms,'' Gorbachev said. ``So far, there are
no improvements in this area.''
   Ryzhkov's deputy, economist Leonid Abalkin, has developed a
detailed plan to make the Soviet ruble convertible on world
markets, jettison money-losing state-run businesses and fill empty
store shelves.
   But Congress also rejected efforts by reformers to discuss key
pieces of the economic reform, including proposed laws on property
ownership and land, that came before the Supreme Soviet legislature
this fall.
   Key economic laws have been submitted for public discussion and
Gorbachev said they could be adopted next spring.
   Of more than 2,000 deputies, 1,387 voted against dicussing the
laws on land and property during the session. A total of 537
supported it and 68 abstained.
   The debate over land and property led to an acrimonious exchange
between Gorbachev and human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Sakharov has demanded an end to the Communist Party's monopoly
on power. He urged a two-hour general strike Monday to show support
for the idea, but the strike fizzled.
   Sakharov urged the deputies to debate ``all the articles
hindering the passing of laws on land, property and other bills
promoting perestroika.''
   When he began to speak about Article 6, Gorbachev cut him short
with a curt ``thank you.'' ``Who is to define what articles to
exclude?'' he asked.
   Sakharov then handed Gorbachev a stack of telegrams in support
of his position.
   ``You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams,''
Gorbachev retorted.
   The Inter-Regional Group, which claims about 400 deputies as
members, decided over the weekend not to endorse the strike.
Members said they didn't want to provoke a public already grumbling
over economic hardship.
   Instead, the deputies called on Soviets to use meetings,
demonstrations, letters and telegrams to the Congress and ``other
means'' to demand that Article 6 and other the key reform laws be
put on the agenda.
   Behind closed doors, progressives also agreed on tactics to
force discussion of their agenda. ``I cannot reveal information to
you on the tactics,'' an Inter-Regional Group activist said Monday
night. ``That was the purpose of the closed session: so the
information wouldn't leak. You will see the tactics tomorrow during
the live broadcast.''
   Televised live to the nation, the inaugural session of Congress
this summer gave voice to a litany of Soviet woes as some deputies
denounced _ and others defended _ the KGB, seven decades of
Communist rule and the crimes of Josef Stalin.
   Perhaps chastened, officials have decided to broadcast only the
opening proceedings of the winter session live. Deputies themselves
will debate how much of the rest to show the country.

<TEXT>
   Two independent opposition parties
today announced their formation in Serbia, defying hard-line
Communist policies in the largest Yugoslav republic.
   Also today, the national Communist Party called for
reconciliation between Serbia and reformist Slovenia. The party's
ruling Politburo also said the situation in the country is
``characterized by strained ethnic relations and tendencies toward
the country's disintegration.''
   Thirteen prominent Belgrade intellectuals announced they were
forming the Democratic Party, while a group within the official
Serbian Socialist Youth Organization is establishing the Movement
For the Democratic Renewal.
   Serbia's Communist authorities headed by president Slobodan
Milosevic have in the past vehemently opposed introduction of
Western-style political pluralism in the southern republic.
   Several independent political and human rights groups have been
banned in Serbia and some of the activists are being prosecuted for
taking part in the illegal work of the organizations.
   It is unclear how the two new parties will operate in view of
continuing opposition from the authorities.
   Snezana Aleksic, an ideologist for Serbia's Communists, told a
gathering Monday that the formation of independent political
parties will lead to the breakup of Yugoslavia.
   In contrast, the authorities in the northern republics of
Slovenia and Croatia have lent their support to the establishment
of opposition parties that are to contest the first-ever multiparty
elections early next year.
   Croatia's Communist leadership, at its congress under way in
Zagreb, for the first time openly urged the establishment of a
parliamentary democracy in Yugoslavia.
   Representatives of both newly formed Serbian parties said at
separate news conferences held in Belgrade that they are striving
for the full legalization of multiparty pluralism, free elections,
freedom of the press and the guaranteeing of human rights.
   A commentary by the country's leading Danas news weekly said the
establishment of independent groups in Serbia represents the first
sign of the weakening within the republic of Milosevic's brand of
Communist orthodoxy.
   Milosevic has built up his popularity in Serbia by claiming he
is fighting for ``the return of Serbian dignity'' which was
allegedly humiliated by other national and ethnic groups within
Yugoslavia, especially by Slovenes and Croats.
   In an unprecedented move in the history of this country, Serbia
this month severed all business and political ties with the liberal
republic of Slovenia, in an apparent attempt to stifle the growing
reform sentiment in Yugoslavia.
   The Serbian action brought fears of the break-up of this loose
federation of six republics, several ethnic groups and religions.
   The State Department said in Washington Monday that it was
worried by rising tensions in Yugoslavia and urged the people to
unite in support of the country's reformist Premier Ante Markovic.
   Markovic has been under strong pressure from conservatives
within the country's Communist Party who oppose his efforts to
create a market-oriented economy and to promote greater political
pluralism.

<TEXT>
   In a Parliament that was once low-tech and
rubber-stamp, a computerized voting system got off to a bumpy start
today.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had to explain the system three
times before the 2,106 attending members of the Congress of
People's Deputies got it right.
   The deputies were to insert their identity cards into hand-held
vote-counters, press a button to register their names, then press
another button indicating ``yes,'' ``no'' or ``abstain'' before
handing the machine to the next person.
   Gorbachev first asked the deputies to simply register their
names. The result was 333 for, 11 against and six abstentions. The
remaining 1,756 apparently pushed no button at all.
   Gorbachev explained the system again, and the second time, 1,985
names were recorded.
   ``Maybe some people still have to learn, but we are on the right
track,'' he said.
   As a back-up, Gorbachev instructed that a committee be formed to
count votes by hand _ the old-fashioned way _ just in case the
system fails during the 10-day session.

   A Japanese company that helps plan seminars on

   Yutaka Horie, president of the Horie Group, said his company
bought the grounded station from the Soviet space agency,
Glavkosmos. It originally was built as a backup for the Mir station
that was launched in February 1986 and still orbits the Earth.
   The Soviets displayed the backup station at World Design Expo,
held from July 15 to Nov. 26 in Nagoya in central Japan, Horie said.
   He said his company bought the station as a symbol of
international cooperation in space, and that he will consult with
space experts on what to do with it.
   Soviet Embassy officials could not be reached immediately for
comment.
   Kyodo News Service quoted unidentified Soviet sources as saying
the sale was meant to promote cooperation in space research beteen
Japan and the Soviet Union.

Hadassah Hospital, said on Israel army radio.
   Shamir probably will be hospitalized for several days, Durst

   A hernia is caused when organs protrude from the body cavity,
usually in the abdominal region. Surgery is sometimes necessary to
prevent the organs from being cut off from the blood supply.

<TEXT>
   The state inspector general is investigating
allegations the New York National Guard used phantom troops to
garner extra federal money.
   But Lt. Col. Peter Kutschera, chief spokesman for the New York
National Guard, said the Guard is clearing out its deadwood and
resents any implication that it intentionally padded its troop
rosters.
   The New York Post reported Monday that no-show soldiers have
been kept on the rosters for at least six years, giving the
Pentagon the false impression that the Guard is ready for war or
national disaster.
   ``The state inspector general is looking at it and because of
this pending investigation it would be inappropriate for us to
comment any further,'' said Steve Villano, spokesman for Gov. Mario
Cuomo. Villano said other investigations had been conducted.
   ``We take sharp exception to this,'' Kutschera said of the
newspaper report. ``To imply that this is a sham or conscious
effort to mislead the Pentagon isn't borne out by the facts.''
   ``The one thing that is particularly disturbing is the assertion
or implication that the New York Army National Guard is not ready
to meet its wartime mission, is not combat ready,'' he said. ``The
vast number are adjudged combat-ready by our supervisory commands.''
   The Post said the New York National Guard's budget has tripled
since 1975 to $390 million a year.
   The newspaper said a phantom force was created in 1984 by Vito
Castellano, who was commander from 1975 to 1986 and reportedly
retired under pressure. It said between 1,600 and 4,000 no-show
Guardsmen in the state still are AWOL and should be dismissed.
   No-shows are not paid, but the Post said the Pentagon provides
funds for their equipment and training, which Kutschera said was
not true.
   ``Federal money for equipment allocated to the National Guard is
not based on drill attendance but on the authorized level of
equipment in the organization itself,'' he said.
   He said that local commanders, in an effort to keep personnel
strength up, have been reluctant to discharge Guardsmen for
unauthorized absences because ``it is cost-effective to
rehabilitate or bring somebody back whom you've already spent money
on.''
   But the effort was ``not particularly successful,'' and the
Guard has been speeding up the discharge of such Guardsmen, he said.
   He said the Guard has 18,900 members, and about 1,523 missed
more than nine drills a year.
   Castellano was released from prison in July after serving one
year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for Wedtech
Corp., the now-defunct defense contractor.
   There was no answer at a suburban telephone under Castellano's
name.

   The 35 people killed in a three-train collision
near one of Europe's busiest rail stations one year ago were
remembered today at an outdoor memorial service and a buffet car
champagne breakfast.
   An express train from Poole, 90 miles southwest of London,
rammed into the back of another passenger train near south London's
Clapham Junction rail station on Dec. 12, 1988. A freight train on
an adjacent line then plowed into spillover wreckage and struck
some passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks.
   Four commuters who regularly ride the express train to London's
Waterloo Station gathered in the buffet car this morning for a
champagne toast to their friends who died.
   ``We are toasting missing colleagues who were with us in the
buffet and who would have preferred it this way, instead of being
somber about it,'' said Christopher Reeves, 39, an engineer who
needed seven stitches in a head wound after the crash.
   British Rail and a government-appointed inquiry blamed careless
signaling work and overworked employees for the malfunctioning
direction lights which caused the accident.
   Mourners, including people who helped in the rescue operation,
gathered in the rain to lay wreaths and pray at the base of a
marble memorial depicting rescuers' outstretched hands.

   The buyer was identified only as Mr. Shimojo of Shimojo's art

   The 27-inch glazed porcelain statue was stolen from a Hong Kong
warehouse last month, and recovered only 10 days ago when Hong Kong
police raided an apartment and arrested three men.
   The horse, exhibited from 1985-1988 at the Dallas Museum of Art,
was returned with a tiny chip in its green-colored saddle,
Sotheby's spokeswoman Polly Hitching said.
   The previous record for Chinese art was $2.76 million paid for a
rare Guanyao brush washer, or small porcelain dish, at a Hong Kong
auction in May.
   The horse was sold by the British Rail pension fund, which paid
$315,000 for it in 1978. The previous price for a Tang horse was
less than $800,000.

<HEAD>Walesa: Give Special Powers to Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today
that the government should be granted special economic powers
allowing it to restructure the economy without the approval of
Parliament.
   Walesa said he was ``fully aware how controversial this proposal
is. But I am forced to make it because of the ever-worsening
situation in the country and the growing impatience of society.''
   It was not known whether the Solidarity-led government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki supported Walesa's position.
   The government is drafting economic reform legislation for
presentation to the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, this
weekend.
   Parliament would have to grant the government special powers to
restructure the economy.
   Walesa argued that legislative debate was slowing the adoption
of laws necessary to end Poland's economic crisis.
   ``The situation in the country is getting worse. Time is running
out. The reserve of social trust is nearly expired,'' he said in a
statement issued by Solidarity union headquarters in Gdansk.
   ``That is why one should act quickly and with determination,''
Walesa said. ``I propose giving the government extraordinary
powers.''
   He said the powers would apply to restructuring the economy,
banking and local government, changing the property system and
ending the monopoly on state-run and cooperative enterprises.
   Walesa said Parliament should grant the powers for a specific
period of time. Lawmakers then could turn their attention to
longer-term laws, while retaining the right to correct acts of the
government, he said.
   One effect of such powers would be to lessen the influence of
the Communist Party and its formerly allied parties in overseeing
economic policy.
   Mazowiecki's government is dominated by Solidarity supporters,
who hold half of the 24 Cabinet seats; the Communists hold four.
   In the Sejm, however, Solidarity has 35 percent of the seats and
the Communists 37 percent.
   There were signs last week that some of the government's radical
economic programs would have trouble in the Sejm because of the
strength of Communist Party loyalists.
   For instance, some members of the party and its former allies
spoke against a government bill that would break up nationwide
``unions of cooperatives.''
   The unions of cooperatives set prices and act as virtual
monopolies in many economic sectors, including food sales and
retailing, and are a source of patronage dominated by party
loyalists.
   The government's reform plan calls for breaking up the
monopolies. One result would be that dairies and food stores would
have to compete against one another.

   Bitter temperatures gripped the Midwest today while an arctic
front stretched from eastern New York southwest across the
Carolinas. Elsewhere, Southern California remained on alert for
damaging Santa Ana winds.
   Temperatures plunged to 32 degrees below zero in Fargo, N.D.; 24
degrees below at Jamestown, N.D.; 16 degrees below at Spencer,
Iowa; 15 below at Storm Lake, Iowa, and 10 below zero at
Burlington, Iowa.
   An even colder high pressure system was predicted for the
Midwest by midweek, with temperatures expected to bottom out
Thursday morning. A slight warming trend was expected for Saturday.
   Snow, sleet and freezing rain pelted parts of the Southeast and
the mid-Atlantic states.
   In Washington, D.C., all public schools and some colleges closed
today. The snow started before dawn, and 4 to 8 inches were
expected by tonight.
   Light rain and drizzle prevailed across Kentucky and Tennessee
into Alabama and Mississippi. Showers and thunderstorms Monday
extended across southern sections of Mississippi and Louisiana.
   Fierce winds raking Southern California on Monday flipped
big-rig trucks like toys, left Christmas tree lots in disarray and
ripped down power lines, knocking out electricity to thousands of
homes.
   The Santa Ana winds, clocked at up to 80 mph, also wreaked havoc
on motorists, stirring up blinding dust storms that cut visibility
to zero as desert sand blasts peppered windshields and paint jobs
with nicks.
   There were no reports of wind-related injuries.
   Travel warnings for trucks, trailers and motor homes remained in
effect through today, particularly on Interstate 15 and Highway 60
in the Riverside-San Bernardino area.
   Winds also buffeted the eastern slopes of the Rockies in Montana
and Wyoming.
   Light snowfall lingered today in Colorado's mountains, northwest
Texas and parts of the lower Great Lakes region and the Upper Ohio
Valley.
   Temperatures remained below freezing Monday from the High Plains
to northern New England, with highs in the teens and single digits.
   The mercury stayed below zero all day in northeastern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   Temperatures rose above 60 degrees from the lower Rio Grande
Valley of Texas to Florida and southern Georgia. Readings in the
70s were confined to southern Florida, southern Louisiana and the
lower Rio Grande Valley.
   Temperatures also warmed into the 60s and 70s in California and
southern Arizona.
   Monday's high was 80 degrees at National City, Calif., and
Imperial Beach, Calif.

   Moslem fundamentalists armed with guns,
sticks, chains and incendiary bombs fought police while protesting
co-ed college activities. Forty people were wounded and more than
300 arrested, authorities said today.
   The clash on Monday began when militant fundamentalists who had
been holed up inside a police-besieged mosque left the building and
tried to march to the city center, said police Maj. Gen. Mahmoud
el-Fakharan.
   When police intervened to stop the demonstrators outside the
mosque, ``they came under fire from the extremists'' and a shootout
ensued, he said.
   Ten policemen and 30 militants were wounded and all the
demonstrators were arrested. Many of the injuries were bullet
wounds, el-Fakharany said.
   The streets of Assiut, 238 miles south of Cairo, were quiet
today.
   The militants were protesting the Assiut University student
union's policy allowing co-ed parties and excursions that they
consider contrary to Islamic teachings.

<TEXT>
   Communists responsible for 21
years of hard-line policy resigned from their last powerful posts
today, as Parliament considered how to select a new president.
   Playwright Vaclav Havel, riding a wave of popular support as
leader of the opposition Civic Forum, has offered to serve as
president until free elections can be held next year. More of his
posters appeared in the capital today.
   Slovakia's regional parliament today asked the Federal Assembly,
or national parliament, to consider former Communist leader
Alexander Dubcek for president and called him ``the most important
figure of modern Czechoslovak history,'' the government news agency
CTK said. Dubcek was ousted after ``Prague Spring'' reforms were
crushed by Soviet tanks in 1968.
   Hard-line Communist President Gustav Husak resigned Sunday after
swearing in a Cabinet that for the first time in four decades was
dominated by non-Communists.
   The new government was a historic victory for the nation's
opposition movement, which has forced the government to open
borders, promise free elections and revoke the Communists'
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society.
   Late Monday, the Club of Communist deputies, a caucus of the
Communists who dominate the 350-member Federal Assembly demanded
the new president be chosen by nationwide referendum, CTK said.
   Prior to the announcement, it was expected that the lawmaking
body _ dominated by Communists and traditionally a rubber-stamp
body for Communist policy _ would select the interim president.
   It was unclear whether or how the deputies would vote on the
issue at the session that opened today with the resignation of
ousted Communist Party chief Milos Jakes and other hard-liners from
their last positions of power as members of the parliament's
guiding Presidium.
   Jakes and former ideology chief Vasil Bilak sat stone-faced as
their fellow deputies in the House of Nations, one of two
constituent bodies of the parliament, accepted their resignations.
   On Monday, in the first act of retribution against hard-liners
who crushed the ``Prague Spring,'' Bilak was charged for his part
in the crackdown, the state news agency CTK said.
   ``According to some opinions, his deeds can be considered
treason,'' CTK said without detailing the charges against Bilak.
   Bilak, who resigned from the party's ruling Politburo last year,
is widely believed to be the Czechoslovak Communist who lent most
support to the August 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform.
   Bilak, now 72, will not however face trial ``for this
wrongdoing,'' CTK said, because of the country's statute of
limitations for crimes committed more than 20 years ago. Although
CTK did not explain the anomaly of charging someone with a crime he
cannot be prosecuted for, it appeared to be a symbolic attribution
of guilt 21 years after the invasion.
   The Slovak Communist Party daily Pravda today said Bilak put
``shame on the party.'' It said he acquired a large villa for
$20,000 after the government renovated it for 10 times as much.
   New posters bearing a portrait of Havel and his motto, ``Truth
and Love Must Prevail Over Lies and Hatred'' appeared all over
central Prague today.
   Havel's face smiled from posters plastered to walls and windows
throughout central Prague over the caption, ``Havel na Hrad,'' or
Havel to the Castle, the presidential residence.
   On Monday, the Civic Forum opposition group issued a statement
backing Havel, but stressing any president chosen now would have to
resign before free elections.
   On Sunday, Havel addressed 100,000 cheering supporters from a
balcony overlooking Wenceslas Square.
   Small groups of demonstrators supporting Havel for president
took to the streets on Monday in Prague, Pilsen and Brno.
   Meanwhile, Havel himself began sounding more like a national
leader than a member of the opposition.
   In an interview with Soviet television also shown on
Czechoslovak television Monday, the playwright reassured leaders in
Moscow that, if elected, he would remain a member of the Warsaw
Pact.
   ``Our ideal is Europe as a peaceful community'' that ultimately
requires a ``dissolution of blocs,'' Havel said.
   But, he added, ``We understand that we shall not get any closer
to this ideal by any kind of individual split from the Warsaw
Treaty, longing for some kind of immediate and individual
neutrality.''
   Several other names have also been floated for president,
including Ladislav Adamec, the former premier who agreed to add
non-Communists to his government but then resigned, and Cestmir
Cisar, expelled from the Communist Party in 1970 after serving as
the student's candidate for president in 1968.
   But, Havel, 53, and Dubcek, 68, were seen as two most serious
contenders.
   Politburo member Ondrej Saling told reporters that a meeting
between Communists and opposition forces on Monday agreed that the
president should be a Czech with no party affiliation.
   ``In my view, the president must be someone who enjoys broad
support and guarantees stability,'' he said, seeming to describe
Havel.
   On Monday, Czechoslovaks filled the air with a jubilant
cacophony of bells, sirens and car horns in celebration of their
popular victory over the Communists.
   The three-minute blast of noise replaced a scheduled general
strike that was called off after the new 21-member Cabinet was
announced Sunday, putting Communists in the minority for the first
time since 1948.

<HEAD>Japan Says it Will Temporarily Halt South Pacific Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will temporarily halt its drift-net fishing
in the South Pacific by 1992 if steps have not been taken by then
to preserve marine life in the region, the Foreign Ministry said
today.
   Environmentalists and South Pacific nations have criticized
Japan and Taiwan for using giant drift nets in the region. The nets
sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean and critics say they kill
virtually all fish and marine animals that swim into them.
   ``In the South Pacific we will stop, at least temporarily, the
catching of albacore tuna by an agreed date, with the expectation
that when management control measures for the preservation of
marine resources are agreed upon, it will be reopened,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.
   Watanabe did not say when Japan would halt the practice, but
another Foreign Ministry official said it would be by 1992.
   Kyodo News Service said Japanese and U.S. representatives at the
United Nations had agreed on a draft resolution calling for an end
to drift-net fishing in the region's international waters by June
30, 1992, except where protective measures have been taken.
   Ministry officials said the decision would not apply to the
North Pacific because measures were being taken to preserve marine
resources in that region.
   Japanese officials say drift nets are the most economical means
of harvesting fish in the open seas.
   Last year, the number of Japanese drift net boats in the South
Pacific surged from 20 to 60 and Taiwan's fleet included at least
60 vessels.
   Following criticism from the region, Japan said it would reduce
its number to 20 this season, and Taiwan promised to reduce its
fleet to 24.

<TEXT>
   Directors of the National Press Club have put
off a decision on renaming the club's H. L. Mencken Library and
Reference Center while they look into revelations of racial and
religious bias in Mencken's writings, club President Peter Holmes
said today.
   ``Everyone felt they wanted to have an opportunity to read the
record and become more acquainted with Mencken and the impetus for
naming the library for him in the first place and the nature of the
brouhaha that arose with the publication of his diaries,'' said
Holmes, an editor with The Washington Times.
   The diaries, published recently, showed deep-set anti-Semetic
and anti-black sentiments by Mencken, who died in 1956.
   Mick Rood, a reporter for States News Service and a member of
the club's board of directors, said last week that he admired
Mencken's writing about language, his political commentary and his
wit. ``With the release of his diary, however, we also know of his
duplicity, his hatred and his bigotry,'' Rood said.
   Holmes said the decision Monday night to postpone consideration
of the issue was reached amiably. He said Rood told the other
directors he intended to pursue it at a meeting in late January.
   Mencken, a beloved native son of Baltimore, wrote a column for
many years for the Evening Sun of Baltimore and was an influential
man of letters in the 1920s and the 1930s.

   Tennessee Secretary of State Gentry
Crowell, whose office is at the center of a scandal over charity
bingo, shot himself in the mouth today in a suicide attempt,
authorities said.
   Crowell, 57, was in stable condition at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center in Nashville, where he was taken for surgery to
remove a bullet in his brain, authorities said.
   ``Depression is a terrible thing. I didn't realize that Gentry
had anything bothering him to that extent,'' said House Speaker Ed
Murray.
   Crowell said last month, when he appeared in Memphis before a
grand jury investigating bingo corruption, that federal
investigators had assured him they were not seeking an indictment
against him.
   Capt. Mike Johnson of the Wilson County Emergency Medical
Service said Crowell was found on his front porch by his son, a
.38-caliber pistol nearby. Police said Crowell's son and wife were
the only other people at home.
   The Internal Revenue Service, FBI and Tennessee Bureau of
Investigation in 1986 began an investigation of alleged bribery and
skimming of profits following reports that bingo operators were
paying state officials to ignore violations of laws regulating the
industry.
   Twenty-two people have been indicted or pleaded guilty in
Tennessee this year as a result of the investigation.
   All Tennessee bingo licenses were suspended March 9 after the
state Supreme Court ruled the games are illegal under the Tennessee
Constitution.
   Crowell has testified twice before federal grand juries
investigating alleged bingo corruption.
   He has not been implicated in the scandal, but one former
employee is serving a prison term in connection with the
investigation and another was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.

   Former Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci defected on Nov. 30 and

   The Communist Party's ruling Politburo met Monday and decided to

<HEAD>Mayor Attends Funeral Despite `Last Wish' of Slain Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Kathy Whitmire attended a funeral for a
slain policeman today despite a plea from his lawyer to stay away
because the officer believed she was no friend of the Police
Department.
   Whitmire and Police Chief Lee P. Brown joined several hundred
officers at the funeral for Jim Boswell at the invitation of
Boswell's father, Cecil E. Boswell of Meridian, Miss., said the
mayor's spokesman, Paul Mabry.
   She did not immediately discuss the issue with reporters at the
service at Second Baptist Church.
   Richard Cobb, lawyer for the Houston Police Patrolmen's Union,
had written Mrs. Whitmire that it was Boswell's ``last wish'' that
``you should not be admitted to his funeral.''
   ``Officer Boswell felt very strongly that you neither respected
nor supported him or his fellow officers when he was a Houston
police officer,'' Cobb wrote.
   Boswell, 29, was shot to death Saturday by a man who approached
him for help as he wrote a traffic ticket. The four-year veteran
had told the man he would have to wait while the officer finished
writing the ticket.
   Craig Neal Ogan, 35, is being held without bail on charges of
capital murder. He was shot by Boswell's partner and remains in
fair condition under police guard at Ben Taub Hospital.
   Boswell was the second Houston officer slain in two days; on
Sunday, an off-duty officer was killed in a domestic dispute.
   Cobb's letter purported to represent Boswell's entire family,
but Mabry said the officer's father was embarrassed by the letter
and wanted the mayor to come.
   Police union president Tommy Britt said the letter had been
written at the elder Boswell's request. Britt speculated that the
officer's father had later ``succumbed to pressure'' to invite the
mayor and police chief.
   Boswell was a cartoonist for The Sentinel, a police union
publication that has been sharply critical of the mayor and
supported her challenger in last month's election.
   ``The very idea of your capitalizing on his death to serve your
own public relations ends was repugnant to him, and, consequently,
to his family,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Canadian Destroyer Clashes With U.S. Fishing Boat</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with captain's comment. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coast Guard officials boarded an American fishing
boat and questioned the captain today after the vessel collided
with a Canadian destroyer and drew warning shots from the warship
in a dispute over fishing rights.
   The confrontation Monday began after the scalloper Concordia
allegedly was spotted fishing 2.5 miles inside Canadian waters,
Coast Guard Petty Officer Ellen Harrington said.
   The fishing boat's captain, William Fuery, said this morning
that his charts indicated he was never in Canadian waters. He said
that the destroyer rammed his vessel and that when the warship
began its pursuit, he fled in fear.
   ``A plane told me to stop my vessel and wait for a warship,'' he
told a Boston radio station. ``I didn't think it was too good of an
idea to wait for a warship. I was out there fishing. I was not at
war.''
   He said he headed back toward American waters while dodging the
Canadian vessel's warning shots.
   ``A couple times I had to change course and get away from him
because I was afraid he was going to ram me again,'' Fuery said.
``When he started shooting at us he was trying to get as close as
he could. At times he was firing shots from a quarter-mile away.''
   Canadian officials told a different version. They said the
fishing boat rammed the 366-foot destroyer three times, prompting
the warning shots.
   The Canadians fired five to 10 rounds with a small,
submachine-like gun about 100 yards ahead of the vessel, and when
that failed to produce any results, they fired a round from a
3-inch, .50-caliber gun in front of the Concordia, said Lt. Doug
Maybee, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy.
   An American crewman on deck at the time of the collision
reportedly was hurt and would seek treatment, said Coast Guard Lt.
Craig Lloyd.
   Coast Guard officials and National Marine Fisheries officers
boarded the scalloper in New Bedford, took statements from the
boat's master and let it return to its port of Fairhaven, Lloyd
said. The evidence will be used in the Canadian investigation.
   There have been several reports this year of American fishing
boats crossing the line to work the rich fishing area on the
Canadian side.
   The destroyer began tracking the Concordia after it was spotted
fishing in Canadian waters five times during the weekend, Maybee
said.

support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
   The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland
was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the
country's increasingly troubled situation. It came a day after
shouting matches broke out over German reunification during
pro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden.
   Also today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged caution
on the reunification issue. He visited the Berlin Wall and met with
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans
Modrow.
   In another development, the largest opposition movement, New
Forum, announced it will take part as a political party in the
country's first free elections, scheduled for May 6.
   Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said
``socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our
country'' and acknowledged that the ``popular revolutionary
movement'' of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old
system.
   The paper repeated the Communists' promise to work for a new
``democratic socialism'' within a multi-party system.
   During the past few weeks, both Germanys have increased business
and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer
relations, since the East Berlin government rejects calls for
reunification.
   Neues Deutschland urged a ``qualified partnership of both German
states'' but rejected any suggestions of resolving the ``German
question.''
   During Monday's demonstrations that drew more than 200,000
protesters, the largest of them the now-weekly rally in the
southern city of Leipzig, speakers warned that the reunification
issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the
ruling Communists into swift retreat.
   One sign said ``Germany United Fatherland,'' using a phrase from
the West German national anthem.
   Others, opposing reunification, urged ``No Fourth Reich'' and no
transformation of East Germany into West Germany's ``plantation.''
   ADN said 40,000 people demonstrated for reunification in
Karl-Marx-Stadt, while several thousand people split into pro- and
anti-reunification groups at a rally in Dresden.
   Smaller rallies were also reported by ADN in Schwerin, Potsdam,
Neubrandenburg and Halle. The agency did not say if reunification
played a role in those protests.
   The rallies came shortly after the four victorious World War II
Allies met in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments in
East Germany and Berlin _ the divided city that they still
technically administer.
   The meeting brought together officials of the United States,
France and Britain with Soviet officials, who have increasingly
expressed concern over calls in both Germanys to reunite the
country.
   Kohl has advocated a confederation of the two Germanys, to be
followed by eventual reunification. But he stressed to reporters on
Monday that ``the goal of our policies is not to create an
overpowering Germany in the middle of Europe.'' The West German
leader advocates a reunified Germany that would respect the
security needs _ and borders _ of the rest of Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a Central
Committee in Moscow on Saturday, urged the West not to try to
influence developments in East Germany. East Germany is a front
line of defense for the Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 troops in
the country.
   ADN said Gorbachev would meet soon with Gregor Gysi, a reformer
who was chosen East German Communist Party chief on Saturday.
   Gysi's rise followed the ouster of two sets of Communist
leaders. Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist
domination two months ago, public pressure has forced the opening
of the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise free
elections and relinquish their political monopoly.

   A moderate earthquake triggered a
mountain slide that killed one person in southern Iran today, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency said no reports were yet available on other
casualties or the extent of damage caused by the quake, which was
centered 65 miles northeast of the city of Shiraz.
   The earthquake registered 4.4 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase in one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage,
and magnitude 5, considerable damage.

   The admiral who investigated the explosion
aboard the battleship USS Iowa said today he knew of no new
information that would change his conclusion that a depressed
Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig likely caused the blast that killed
47 sailors.
   But the statements by Navy officials in defense of their
findings failed to sway several members of the House Armed Services
investigations subcommittee, who continued to question the
service's findings in the tragedy last April 19.
   ``I believe after these hearings we all will have a much better
insight into this man (Hartwig) to see if he indeed was the type of
person who could have killed himself and 46 of his shipmates,''
subcommittee Chairman Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., said at the
start of three days of hearings.
   ``I am not now convinced he was capable of such an act,''
Mavroules added.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw the inquiry into the
explosion that rocked gun turret No. 2 on the Iowa, told lawmakers
he knew his conclusion would be ``the source of controversy, and
for many, of pain and heartache.''
   However, he said his investigation eliminated accident and
malfunction as a cause and, in his opinion, the explosion was the
result of an intentional act.
   Milligan said that since he released the report on Sept. 7, ``I
know of nothing that would cause me to change my report.''
   Members of the House panel zeroed in on the issue of the
rotating band from the 16-inch gun, which according to the Navy
included some foreign material, likely from a detonator. Navy
officials theorized that Hartwig used some type of detonator to
trigger the explosion.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., questioned whether the band could have
been contaminated following the explosion in the cleanup effort in
the gun turret or in the Navy's handling of the evidence.
   Capt. Joseph D. Miceli, director of the Naval Sea Systems
Command technical investigative team, said the band was not
contaminated and the foreign material had been embedded in it.
   The Navy's finding also came under siege in a Senate committee
Monday as the ship's captain refused to endorse the conclusion that
Hartwig likely caused the blast.
   ``You know, the Navy's on trial here in a way,'' Sen. John
Warner of Virginia, a former Navy secretary, said in
cross-examining FBI psychologists who depicted Hartwig as a
suicidal loner.
   Warner, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and his panel colleagues zeroed in on three FBI
officials who testified Monday that they told the Naval
Investigative Service they believed Hartwig displayed numerous
symptoms of a person contemplating suicide.
   The hard-nosed interrogation came after Iowa Capt. Fred
Moosally, in his first public testimony about the incident, told
the panel, ``I do not agree or disagree'' with the Navy's
conclusions.
   ``I embraced that it was an intentional act,'' Moosally told
reporters after his appearance. ``I cannot make the jump that it
was absolutely Petty Officer Hartwig. ... I don't think I can say
that a definite individual did it. He was a good gunner's mate.''
   Moosally, however, said he thought the ship had been sabotaged
because he didn't believe there could be any other explanation for
the April 19 explosion.
   The service, in its Sept. 7 report, concluded that Hartwig
``most likely'' caused the blast by inserting some type of
detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch
guns.
   Navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial
because all the witnesses, including Hartwig, were killed.
   The service said the case against Hartwig was built largely on
evidence drawn from forensic tests and a psychological profile,
which was a point of contention Monday for members of the Senate
panel.
   Using information provided by the Naval Investigative Service,
including Hartwig's letters, interviews with the seaman's family
and friends and his personal history, three FBI psychologists
testified that Hartwig was ``egocentric, shy ... not sufficiently
aggressive, had a low self-esteem.''
   With members of Hartwig's family sitting nearby, the
psychologists cited various bits of information that when pieced
together, according to their assessment, form a picture of a loner
bent on self-destruction.
   The FBI officials, however, acknowledged that they had no hard
evidence that Hartwig was responsible for the explosion.
   ``His whole fabric is death and destruction,'' said Robert
Hazelwood of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Analysis Program.
   Among the information on Hartwig was a subscription to Soldier
of Fortune magazine he had as a teen-ager, a suicidal gesture he
once made to a friend at age 17 or 18, his collection of knives and
his reference to the Iowa as a ``damning pig.''
   The FBI officials also said that at the time of his death,
Hartwig had ``$34 in his bank account, few clothes and a poorly
maintained vehicle.''
   But members of the committee questioned how the psychologists
could determine that, based on traits fairly common among young
sailors, the 24-year-old Hartwig was suicidal.

   An Egyptian airliner landed here today
for the first time in 10 years, marking an improvement in relations
between the two Arab countries at odds with each other since
Cairo's peace treaty with Israel.
   The Egypt Air Boeing 737 carried a special party of officials
lead by Maj. Gen. Samir Rashad, Egypt's deputy minister of
transport.
   The two countries still do not have diplomatic relations, but
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez Assad
decided during a telephone call Monday to resume air links.
   Syria and Libya are the only Arab holdouts against
rehabilitating Egypt by restoring diplomatic relations severed to
protest Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. The other 15 Arab
states that broke off ties for the same reason have since restored
them.
   But small steps toward full normalcy have been evident in recent
months in Egypt's relations with Syria and Libya.
   Mubarak visited the Libyan town of Sirte today for talks with
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the Middle East News Agency said. It
was their fourth meeting this year and the news agency report
indicated economic cooperation would be a main topic.
   The Egyptian news agency said the air agreement with Syria was
reached in a telephone call Mubarak made to President Hafez Assad
of Syria.
   The accord takes effect today, the agency said, and Mubarak
ordered ``prompt implementation.'' It did not say how many weekly
flights EgyptAir and Syrian Arab Airlines, the national carriers,
would operate between Cairo and Damascus.
   Air services were halted immediately after the diplomatic
rupture.
   Middle East News Agency also reported that Mubarak would be
sending a special envoy to Assad in Damascus within the next few
days. Government sources said the emissary was expected to be
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   Resuming air services is the first normalization measure since
Mubarak and Assad met privately in May during an Arab summit in
Casablanca, Morocco.
   Sixteen months earlier, the two leaders had talked privately on
the sidelines of an Islamic summit in Kuwait. That meeting, in
January 1987, was the first for the two since Mubarak took office
in 1981.
   Egypt's relations with Libya thawed faster this year than with
Syria.
   Mubarak and Gadhafi also met in Casablanca during the May
summit. Then they met twice in October, first in Egypt's
Mediterranean city of Mersa Matruh, close to the border between the
North African countries, and the next day in Libya's port of Tobruk.
   Gadhafi and Mubarak agreed to closer economic ties in
agriculture, petroleum and industry. Low-level Egyptian and Libyan
delegations exchanged visits to promote cooperation, including
possible joint projects.
   In June, Egypt and Libya resumed direct air services and
reopened frontiers closed since 1977 when the two countries fought
a five-day war.
   Gadhafi's hostility toward Egypt stemmed mainly from its refusal
to merge with Libya in 1972 and its peace with Israel.

   The National Commission on AIDS today called
for an end to practices that discriminate against visitors to the
United States who are infected with the AIDS virus.
   The commission also called for an end to the questioning of
non-immigrants about their AIDS status while applying for visas.
   ``This would eliminate the current practice of stopping
travelers who are carrying AZT, which is the only licensed anti-HIV
drug, and blood products such as clotting factor, which is used by
hemophiliacs,'' the commission said. HIV stands for human
immunodeficiency virus, believed to be the cause of AIDS.
   ``In some cases travelers have been ejected from the United
States because it was revealed, by inference or direct questioning,
that the traveler had HIV infection,'' the commission said.
   Current U.S. visa practices have been criticized by a number of
scientific, medical and humanitarian organizations.
   The commission said that when HIV testing is part of the
immigration process, the federal agencies must ensure that
standards are enforced for counseling, confidentiality and
referrals for health care.
   The National Commission on AIDS is an independent body created
by Congress to oversee efforts against the disease and to make
recommendations for national policy.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious,
incurable disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
is spread through contact with blood or with semen from infected
persons. No one is known to have recovered from the disease.

<HEAD>$130 Million Desegregation Settlement Approved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved a $130 million
settlement of a 7-year-old school desegregation case but put the
money in a court-supervised account to make sure it's spent on
addressing racial discrimination.
   ``It is now abundantly clear that the settlement funds cannot be
trusted to the parties,'' U.S. District Judge Henry Woods said
Monday.
   Under the settlement, the state agreed to pay $130 million to
help achieve racial balance in three school districts in Pulaski
County, which includes Little Rock, the scene in 1957 of a landmark
federal-state showdown over segregation.
   The money will be used to implement a plan to assign students
among the districts to promote racial balance; to reimburse the
costs of raising the level of education in Little Rock, and to pay
other desegregation costs.
   In approving the settlement, Woods blasted school districts for
suggesting that the money be used to pay debts unrelated to
desegregation, and he cut the plaintiff's attorney fees sharply,
from $3.15 million to $850,000.
   Woods ordered that the largest desegregation settlement in state
history be put in an account monitored by a court-appointed
supervisor.
   ``The amount of money is meager enough,' he said. ``To put money
in the hands of those who feel no compunction even to say they
intend to spend the money to compensate the victims of racial
discrimination would be a grave injustice.''
   The Little Rock School District, which is mostly black, had sued
the neighboring, mostly white North Little Rock and Pulaski County
districts, alleging that the placement of new schools had prompted
white flight from the Little Rock schools. The districts have a
total enrollment of about 58,000.
   The settlement was reached in March. In a special session in
July, the Legislature agreed to spend $129.75 million over 10 years
for desegregation.
   The Little Rock-area districts in 1982 began magnet schools,
which attract both blacks and whites by offering a specialized
curriculum, and busing to achieve racial balance began in 1972.
   In 1957, then-Gov. Orval Faubus refused to allow nine black
students to enter Little Rock's all-white Central High School.
President Eisenhower sent federal troops to keep the peace and
enforce court-ordered desegregation.

   The government has banned public
demonstrations and warned that police will use force to keep order,
one day after 40,000 took to the streets and demanded that
President Mathier Kerekou resign.
   Similar demonstrations also took place Monday in the capital
city of Porto Novo, Ouidah and Abomey, with reports of violence and
one death.
   The ban was announced by radio Monday evening following the
march by 40,000 in Cotonou, Benin's economic capital.
   Last week, Kerekou announced the government was scrapping its
Marxist-Leninist ideology and would draft a new constitution
liberalizing the economy and guaranteeing human rights.
   The government has been unable to pay bills, including the
salaries of thousands of government employees.
   Western economists say Kerekou's efforts to impose centralized
controls on the economy has hampered growth. In recent months,
several scandals have further tarnished his image, including the
arrest of two associates on drug trafficking charges.
   Benin, a former French colony, is one of the world's poorest
nations, with a per capital income of $310 and a foreign debt of
nearly $1 billion.

   Noel Hicks grows winter wheat in the harsh, arrid, wind-swept
Oklahoma Panhandle, the heart of what was once the Dust Bowl. In
early 1988, the weather was dry in Guymon, Okla., although nothing
really out of the ordinary.
   Winds he estimated at 80-90 mph damaged 147.5 acres of irrigated
wheat in February 1988. By harvest time, nothing was worth cutting,
so he just plowed it up, he said. He didn't have insurance.
   Months later, unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought
relief bill _ a program that hadn't even been considered when the
winds took his wheat.
   He collected $11,499.
   ``If the wheat had been good, we would have made twice that
much,'' Hicks said. ``I'd rather have a big wheat crop than take a
check from the government anytime.''

<HEAD>Kenyan Says Ethiopia Will Allow Relief Food to Famine Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Ethiopia has agreed to
establish a corridor for emergency food aid into its embattled and
drought-stricken north, Kenya's president said Tuesday.
   President Daniel arap Moi said he had asked Ethiopia's two main
rebel groups to do the same and ``to stop fighting when this food
aid is being delivered. I hope they will do so.''
   He said the rebels had not responded to his request.
   Moi said he asked Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam ``to
create a corridor for food aid to pass to the people of Tigre and
Eritrea. He has accepted that request.'' It was not clear if Moi
was referring to people in government-held areas, in war zones or
in both.
   The United Nations says the drought in Ethiopia's northern
provinces of Eritrea, Tigre, Gonder and Wollo threatens as many as
4 million people with starvation, and it has urged international
donors to provide 600,000 tons of emergency relief food. Ethiopia's
government disputes the U.N. figure and claims the real number of
people threatened with famine is 1.8 million.
   About half the people threatened with famine live behind rebel
lines. Relief agencies fear mass migrations of the hungry to
government-held areas in search of food.
   Such migrations in the 1984-85 famine led to vast, overcrowded
and unsanitary camps where as many people died from disease as from
hunger. As many as 1 million people are believed to have died in
that disaster.
   An Ethiopian government spokesman attending preliminary peace
talks that opened Tuesday in Rome between Ethiopia's government and
the rebel Tigre People's Liberation Army confirmed that a corridor
would be opened and said a date for the start of relief shipments
along the route would be decided this week.
   The spokesman, who declined to give his name, would not give any
details on the proposed route.
   However, a rebel spokesman also at the talks said he did not
think any such relief corridor would be opened soon.
   ``We are pushing for corridors between the rebel-controlled
areas as well as between the government-controlled areas, at least
for free passage of relief and relief workers,'' but so far to no
avail, said the spokesman, who identified himself only as Hayla.
   Neither spokesman would say whether Moi intervened in attempts
to establish the corridor.
   The idea of relief corridors into embattled areas was
implemented in southern Sudan this year when the United Nations
launched a massive aid program aimed at averting tens of thousands
of famine deaths.
   Sudan's government and the nation's southern rebels respected
the half a dozen corridors, or routes, established for the delivery
of relief supplies into southern Sudan for about six months before
the de facto cease-fire dissolved in renewed fighting.
   Moi's announcement came on the opening day of a second round of
preliminary peace talks in Rome between Ethiopia's government and
the rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front aimed at ending their
14-year-old civil war.
   The Tigreans, in a 3-month-old offensive, have pushed to within
100 miles of Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, and are seen as a
growing threat to Mengistu's government.
   Ethiopia's other major rebel group, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, which has been fighting a secessionist battle in
northern Eritrea province since 1961, ended its second round of
preliminary peace talks with the government Nov. 29. Both sides
have agreed to begin substantial negotiations next year.

<TEXT>
   A late surge of support for
leftist candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has made the former
lathe operator a strong contender to become Brazil's next president
in Sunday's runoff election.
   Da Silva, who trailed conservative Fernando Collor de Mello by
10 to 15 points in public opinion polls a week ago, narrowed the
gap to 3 points in a survey released Monday by the Datafolha
polling organization.
   The winner will be Brazil's first freely elected president in 29
years. The incumbent, Jose Sarney, was picked by an Electoral
College strongly influenced by the military regime that ran the
country between 1964 and 1985.
   The prospect of a leftist victory was credited with causing a 30
percent jump in dollar prices on the black market Monday.
   A cartoon in the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo Tuesday showed a
dollar bill chasing da Silva up a flight of stairs saying, ``You
want to stop climbing because I'm tired!''
   Many analysts predict da Silva, popularly known as Lula, will
overtake Collor de Mello.
   ``Lula is the clear favorite. Only a huge mistake on his part
can save Collor de Mello,'' said political commentator Ricardo
Noblat of the Rio daily newspaper Jornal do Brasil.
   Just weeks ago, a victory for da Silva seemed all but impossible.
   In balloting Nov. 15, Collor de Mello won 28 percent of the vote
while da Silva finished second with 16 percent. Since no candidate
received a majority, Sunday's runoff was scheduled.
   Polls show support is growing nationwide for da Silva, who has
attracted huge crowds. Collor de Mello, meanwhile, has canceled
three days of campaign activities to revamp his TV spots.
   Some say the turning point in the campaign was a Dec. 3
televised debate, which polls show da Silva won.
   ``Lula has a message that is far more popular than Collor de
Mello's,'' said Alexandre Barros, director of Early Warning, a
political consulting firm.
   Da Silva, of the Marxist-oriented Workers Party, preaches
sweeping agrarian reform, a massive redistribution of wealth and an
immediate suspension of interest payments on Brazil's $110 billion
foreign debt, the largest in the Third World.
   Collor de Mello, of the conservative National Reconstruction
Party, has campaigned on a platform of cleaning up and reducing
Brazil's corrupt state bureaucracy.
   Analysts say da Silva has greater credibility as a proponent of
social change in a country where most workers earn less than $100
per month.
   A grade-school dropout, da Silva worked as a delivery boy and
messenger before landing a job as a metalworker. As union
president, he was jailed by the military government after leading a
huge strike in 1980 against foreign-owned automobile companies.
   In 1986, he was elected to congress with more votes than any
other candidate.
   Collor de Mello, born into one of the country's most powerful
families, entered politics in 1979 when military leaders appointed
him mayor of Maceio, the capital of northeastern Alagoas state. He
later was elected federal representative and governor.
   The Workers Party has shown that Collor de Mello hired thousands
of public employees, including family members, during his tenure as
mayor. He also was accused of favoring the state's wealthy sugar
barons.
   As governor, Collor de Mello did fire some local civil servants
earning thousands of dollars a month _ much more than the average
worker _ and he gained national headlines for weeding out the
so-called ``maharajas.''
   ``Other parties and politicians show concern for the plight of
the poor but it is not perceived as real. Only the Workers Party
can legitimately say it is from the people,'' said Francisco
Weffort, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo and
supporter of da Silva.
   Da Silva has the support of labor groups, intellectuals and the
progressive wing of Brazil's powerful Roman Catholic church.
   His well-organized party has more than 1 million campaign
workers across the country and won endorsements from leftist
opponents Leonel Brizola and Mario Covas, who finished third and
fourth in the Nov. 15 balloting.
   Collor de Mello's most prominent supporters are big businessmen,
rural landowners and conservative politicians.
   ``Collor de Mello can't present his allies because they cost him
votes. They're all identified with a system everyone wants to
change,'' political commentator Noblat said.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with candlelight rally, new quotes;
Picks up 5th graf, `The policy-making ...'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 20,000 people joined a candlelight
rally tonight urging rapid democratic reforms, while Communist
leaders discussed demands for free elections and the elimination of
their monopoly on power.
   The crowd gathered outside the Communist Party Central
Committee's building downtown. Some people put their candles on
building ledges, but a guard later scornfully blew out candles and
threw them away.
   ``This is the best place to put the candles because it's right
under their noses,'' meaning the party leaders inside, said two
young men who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   When asked if they thought the Central Committee would notice
the candles, one said, ``They don't have any other choice. We are
the reform.''
   Party chief Petar Mladenov told the Central Committee Monday
that dialogue should begin immediately between the Communists and
all political forces ``without exceptions.'' He also said the party
was prepared to relinquish its constitutionally guaranteed leading
role.
   In a two-hour speech, Mladenov said he favored a ``socialist
market economy,'' implying some easing of state ownership.
   The policy-making Central Committee met today to consider the
proposals, the latest in a series of democratic reforms since
hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10, a day after the
Berlin Wall effectively came down.
   The meeting comes as popular pressure for reform is mounting,
with thousands taking to the streets in the last two days to demand
Bulgaria follow the reform movements sweeping nearly all the rest
of Eastern Europe.
   In other developments in the region:
   _ The Soviet Congress, convening in Moscow today, rejected a
debate on whether to scrap the Communist Party's leading role in
society.
   _ More than 150,000 people rallied for democracy in the East
German city of Leipzig, with shouting matches erupting for a fourth
straight week over whether Germany should reunite. Other rallies
Monday took place in Karl-Marx-Stadt, Dresden, Neubrandenburg,
Halle and Potsdam.
   _ Yugoslavia's political crisis deepened as Communist leaders in
the country's second-largest state, Croatia, joined colleagues in
Slovenia in defying populous Serbia and demanding a multiparty
system.
   As the Central Committee met in Sofia on Monday, more than
10,000 people gathered outside party headquarters in a silent
candlelight vigil to underline their demands for change.
   Since Mladenov took over as Communist chief, he has ousted
several of Zhivkov's supporters from the ruling Politburo.
   ``One cannot postulate the role of party in a democratic society
or define it on command,'' he told the Central Committee. ``This
role can only be (won) as a result of the people's trust.''
   Evgeni Aleksandrov, a party spokesman, said the provision
guaranteeing Communist supremacy ``is to be abolished'' in a new
constitution next year and free and democratic elections should be
scheduled by May.
   In making such promises, Mladenov appeared to meet the major
demands of more than 50,000 people who rallied in Sofia on Sunday.
This year, Communists first in Poland and Hungary and more recently
East Germany and Czechoslovakia have given up their guaranteed
leading role in society.
   Aleksandrov told reporters that dialogue could begin with
opponents immediately and said such talks ``could be very useful in
preparing the elections.''
   Mladenov, who only became party leader one month ago, also
proposed that party leaders be limited to just two terms in office,
or eight years total. He proposed that the term of the current
leadership end at the next party congress, which he said should be
moved up from late 1990 to March.
   Since Zhivkov's downfall after 35 years in power, the official
media have become more open, people have been able to demonstrate
without police interference for the first time in more than 40
years, and independent groups have been allowed to function.
   At Monday's evening vigil, a woman caught up in an emotional
debate said Bulgarians were willing to stand there around the clock
until the leadership acted on reform.
   Aleksandrov said Mladenov proposed that Parliament in January
address the most urgent economic problems in the country of 8.9
million people and discuss a concrete ``stabilization program.''
   Mladenov did not go into detail, but indicated he was for mixed
ownership when he called for a ``Socialist market economy.''
   He quoted Mladenov as saying the socialist system in Bulgaria
had ``degenerated into a regime of personal power _ namely
Zhivkov.''
   With the changes now promised in Bulgaria, Romania, under
hard-line leader Nicolae Ceausescu, remains the only Warsaw Pact
ally resistent to reform.

<HEAD>Young Says It's Time for `New Start' at FDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young, leaving after
the worst scandal in the agency's history, said in a farewell
speech Tuesday that it is time for a new beginning at the FDA.
   ``To fully get through this, though, FDA needs a little
breathing room, some space as my son might say, to reassess its
priorities and to develop a strategy for the next decade,'' Young
told the Food and Drug Law Institute's annual education conference.
   He did not speak of his reason for leaving the job after 5{
years, but said ``the acceptance of illegal gratuities by three
former FDA employees ... has shamed and angered all 7,500 of us in
the agency.''
   Sources inside and outside government have said they believe
Young was forced out because of the generic drug scandal that
uncovered fraud, corruption and mismanagement within the agency.
   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services,
told the group that he would not ``tolerate bribery, fraud or other
illegalities or improprieties'' and said he is directing
establishment of an advisory committee on the Food and Drug
Administration.
   ``This advisory committee will explore current concerns about
the FDA and develop policy or structural recommendations to address
any problems they uncover,'' he said, giving the panel a year to
make its report.
   Young will become deputy assistant secretary for health, science
and environment. Young's old and new jobs are in the Public Health
Service, which is part of HHS.
   His farewell speech reflected some bitterness with recent events
and the treatment generally of FDA, whose mission is to regulate
quality, testing and approval of the nation's food and
pharmaceuticals.
   Young said FDA employees deserve more respect.
   ``We've had enough, too much, of politicians who view civil
servants as part of the problem,'' he said, adding that the agency
needs competitive salaries and better facilities.
   ``I am truly ashamed of the inadequate, poor facilities that we
occupy in 23 buildings located at seven sites around the city and
suburbs of Washington,'' Young said.
   He called the bribery scandal ``an aberration in a long
tradition of excellent service to the nation,'' and offered this
advice:
   _To special interest groups and their representatives: ``You've
got to stop approaching FDA as if your special interest, your
single interest, were the only issue we face. You must begin to
understand that not all public health issues are created equal,
that your particular hobby horse may not be the FDA's No. 1 public
health or regulatory problem, nor should it be.''
   _To Congress: ``One concern I would raise is the tendency for
Congress to act more like a cluster of individuals than a
legislative body. It's as if the beautiful forest that we once knew
had been replaced by a group of individual trees.
   ``The agency deserves the guarantee of no new responsibilities
without concomitant resources, (and) while FDA is most willing to
accept constructive criticism from the Congress such criticism
should be factually based and consistent with a reasonable
assessment of agency priorities ... the agency should respectfully
ask members of Congress to resist the temptation to grandstand on
FDA issues.''
   _To lawyers: ``When you approach the agency ... carry your own
credibility as well as your client's. If your client's case is a
strong one, by all means argue strongly. But if your client's case
is a weak one, don't oversell.''
   _To the president: ``The FDA is somewhat like a referee in a
football game. While most people cheer loudly for the home team,
and a few even cheer for the visiting team, nobody ever cheers for
the referee. And yet, like the referee, FDA often has to make the
difficult calls _ and without the benefit of an instant replay.''

<HEAD>UNICEF Says 100 Million Children May Die Needlessly in 1990s</HEAD>

   Third World nations could save 7.6 million
of their own children from death by disease every year by shifting
a small part of their military expenditures to health care, UNICEF
said Tuesday.
   Developing countries spend a total of $145 billion a year on
their military establishments, James P. Grant, executive director
of UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, said in his annual report.
   He said nearly 8,000 children die each day in the Third World
because they are not immunized, almost 7,000 a day die of
dehydration caused by diarrhea and about 6,000 of pneumonia, for a
total of 7.6 million.
   The cost of immunizing all children and providing medicines for
dehydration and pneumonia would be about $2.5 billion a year, Grant
said in his report, ``The State of the World's Children _ 1990.''
   ``It is a great deal of money,'' Grant said. ``It is as much as
the Soviet Union has been spending on vodka. It is as much as U.S.
companies have been spending on advertising cigarettes. It is as
much as 10 percent of the EEC's annual subsidy to its farmers. It
is as much as 2 percent of the developing world's military
spending.''
   In the report, Grant said Third World countries spend ``almost
$1 billion every day'' for the military and interest on foreign
debt, ``two essentially unproductive activities.''
   At a news conference Tuesday in Washington, he said: ``It is in
the power of industrial countries to significantly reduce the debt
burden, which is taking such a tremendous toll.''
   Because of such unproductive drains on resources, he wrote in
the report, education spending per pupil has dropped by 25 percent
in the 37 poorest countries in the past decade, and health spending
has fallen in most of Africa and Latin America.
   If trends continue, the report said, more than 100 million
children will die needlessly in the next decade.
   ``They will die in the sunken-eyed coma of dehydration, or in
the gasping extremities of pneumonia, or in the iron grip of
tetanus, or in the fever of measles, or on the rack of whooping
cough,'' Grant said.
   Those illnesses, all treatable or preventable with inexpensive
vaccines, antibiotics or oral rehydration therapy, account for over
half of the 14 million annual child deaths in the world and most of
the malnutrition, according to UNICEF.
   To mobilize the political will to solve those problems in the
1990s, UNICEF wants a ``World Summit for Children' to be held in
September at U.N. headquarters in New York. Grant said more than
100 countries had endorsed a summit, which would be the first
gathering of world leaders for the specific purpose of addressing a
major social issue.
   ``It is time that the needs of children were given this kind of
priority,'' he said.
   ``Protecting the physical and mental development of children is
the most important of all investments in the social and economic
development of our societies. Doing what can now be done to achieve
that goal is therefore an issue worthy of its place on the agenda
of the world's political leaders.''
   About 1.5 billion children will be born in the 1990s, the
largest new generation in history. U.N. population figures indicate
the birth rate will begin to decline in the next century.
   Grant's report gave examples of remarkable progress in solving
health problems that is possible in a short time if there is a
collective will:
   _ Ten years ago, fewer than 10 percent of the children in the
Third World were immunized; now almost 70 percent receive
immunization, which saves about 2 million lives a year.
   _ Oral rehydration therapy for diarrheal disease victims is used
by one of three families in the developing world, and saves about 1
million children a year. In the early 1980s, the technique was
almost unknown outside scientific cicles.
   _ The spread of polio immunization in the last decade has meant
about 1.5 million children are walking, running and playing today
who otherwise would have been crippled.

   Israel on Tuesday unveiled a full-scale
prototype of its first communications satellite, scheduled to be
launched in 1993, and officials said they expected it to boost
Israeli high technology exports.
   The 30-foot-by-30-foot, 1,320-pound Amos satellite will have
about half the capability of most Western communications satellites
and will function for 10 years, said Phil Herman, a spokesman for
the government-owned Israel Aircraft Industries. It has no military
applications, he said.
   Israel plans to launch two Amos communications satellites in
1993 and will offer to sell it to foreign countries or
corporations. The launch will be carried out by the European
Arianne space consortium.
   ``The satellite is designed for developing countries and very
large corporations that need a dedicated satellite for their own
purposes,'' Herman said.
   In September 1988, Israel launched its first space satellite,
Horizon-1, which remained in orbit for almost four months. It was
launched on an Israeli missile and was used for scientific research.

   Congress' first order of business when it
reconvenes next month will be an attempt to override President
Bush's veto of a bill permitting Chinese students to remain in the
United States indefinitely if they fear retaliation at home, the
bill's sponsor said today.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she has received assurances of
the top priority from House and Senate leaders that an override
vote would be the first order of business when Congress returns to
session in late January.
   Congressional Democrats, fuming over renewed high-level U.S.
visits with China's leaders, also are vowing to revive legislation
imposing sanctions on the Chinese government as punishment for the
killings of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Pelosi, at a news conference, said she is gaining commitments to
override now from Democrats and Republicans and is confident of a
large bipartisan majority.
   ``I think we have enough (votes) to override,'' she said. ``We
feel the president's actions this weekend are such a slap in the
face to the forces of democracy and such an encouragement of a
tyranical regime that it is making our job easier.''
   Haiching Zhao, chairman of the National Committee on Chinese
Student Affairs, said the administration's high-level visit to
China will strengthen the hardliners in Beijing and encourage a
``slide into darkness'' in China.
   ``The situation in China has not been improved since the June
4th massacre,'' he said. ``Taken together, the veto and the visit
create a clear and present danger that the hardliners in the
Chinese government will now feel free to impose more repression and
further reprisals against the democracy movement.''
   ``Congress is in no mood to kowtow to these Chinese leaders,''
Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Asian subcommittee, said Monday as he predicted Congress will
override the Bush veto and adopt the legislation requiring
sanctions.
   But Congress is out of session and a legislative attack on
Bush's China policy must wait until the second session of the 101st
Congress convenes late next month.
   Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky joined Democrats in
the criticism.
   ``I think it's the wrong message at the wrong time, although I
know what the president was trying to do,'' McConnell said this
morning on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``We have historically, when we
have made overtures to the Soviet Union or had big meetings with
the Soviet Union, felt the need to have some gesture in the
direction of the Chinese.''
   Bush gained support for his overature to China, however, from
Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. In a statement, he called the criticism
premature and said the trip was ``a risky but thoughtful
consultation'' that could lead to moderation by China.
   Democratic leaders made clear their strong disagreement with
Bush's decision to dispatch Brent Scowcroft, his national security
adviser, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to
Beijing over the weekend for the first high-level meetings with
China's leaders since the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in June.
   ``I condemn the president's veto of the Chinese students bill
and this weekend's embarrassing kowtowing to the Chinese
government,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
``These actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for
human rights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals.''
   Mitchell said he will lead the fight to override the Bush's Nov.
30 veto of legislation which would permit Chinese students to
remain in the United States if they fear reprisal at home.
   ``We will make every effort to override that veto,'' Mitchell
said.
   Although the House and Senate approved differing versions of
sanctions legislation, they failed to complete action on a single
measure before Congress adjourned for the year on Nov. 21.
   Both bills would incorporate into law the steps Bush took
voluntarily after the Chinese crackdown.
   Although the legislation would permit the president to suspend
sanctions if he certified that doing so was in the national
interest, it likely would be politically difficult without
significant human rights improvement in China.
   The sanctions include:
   _Suspending insurance and financing for U.S. investment in China
by the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   _Barring export to China of all weapons and military equipment
or equipment intended for police use.
   _Prohibiting export of nuclear supplies, equipment and
technology.
   _Barring the export of American satellites.
   _Requiring the president to seek the imposition of similar
sanctions by U.S. allies.

   The Labor Department proposed $3.3 million in
fines Tuesday against a Philadelphia plant for 840 alleged safety
violations, including failure to tell some workers that tests
showed their hearing was deteriorating.
   Most of the citations issued to the Budd Co. by the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleged violations
either of noise- and hearing-related standards or requirements that
employers keep detailed records of workplace injuries.
   Of the 840 citations, 834 were for alleged willful violations of
safety standards _ meaning that OSHA believes the company knew of
violations or hazardous conditions but made no meaningful effort to
correct them.
   Nearly 500 of the alleged willful violations dealt with
noise-related standards, including 124 instances in which OSHA said
company-administered tests showed employees' hearing had
deteriorated but the company did not inform the workers.
   Budd, which makes doors, lift gates and other sheet-metal
products for automobiles, has 15 working days to contest the
citations and fine _ the fifth largest proposed by OSHA.
   The company said in a statement that it was committed to worker
safety, had hired a consultant to assess noise exposure and had
revised its medical record-keeping.
   However, the company said it could not reply in detail to the
citations because its officials had not had time to review them.
   ``The plant, like OSHA, is deeply concerned about any situation
which may pose a threat to the safety of its employees and the
company will do everything appropriate to ensure that its employees
continue to work in the safest environment possible,'' the company
said from its Troy, Mich., corporate office.
   Budd said about 2,400 people work at the Philadelphia plant,
which was inspected by OSHA beginning in June after an employee
complaint.
   ``Hearing loss is one of the most debilitating hazards found in
this type of workplace, and systematic deficiencies in virtually
all aspects of this company's hearing conservation program to
protect workers against such loss were identified,'' Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in a statement.
   Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard F. Scannell, who heads OSHA,
said tests indicated that noise levels in an area where 150 press
operators work were above government limits.
   Citations against the company included allegations of failure to
administer annual audiogram tests; failure to compare annual
hearing test results with baseline hearing levels or failure to
have physicians review problem cases; willful violations of
record-keeping regulations; and inadequate noise monitoring.
   The largest fine proposed by OSHA was $7.3 million, levied
earlier this year against USX Corp for alleged safety violations.
That case is pending.

<HEAD>Bush Administration May Lift Ban on Export of Satellites for China</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs, editing throughout to tighten.</HEAD>

   The Bush administration, in another possible
concession to Beijing, said today it may lift a ban on the export
of three communications satellites that would be launched by China.
   ``No decision has been made but it is possible,'' White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   If granted, the waiver would be a further softening of U.S.
sanctions imposed against China after the June massacre of hundreds
of pro-democracy advocates.
   The White House confirmed on Monday that Chinese engineers have
been allowed to return to work in the United States on a $500
million program to upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes with
sophisticated electronics equipment.
   The Bush administration also has renewed U.S. subsidies for
grain sales to Beijing.
   On Dec. 5, the Agriculture Department announced that China would
be eligible to buy an additional one million metric tons of wheat
using Export Enhancement Program subsidies.
   The announcement came as the Chinese had used up almost all of
their previous EEP allocation, a two-million-ton promise that had
been made when President Bush visited China last February. Nearly
half the sales under that allocation have been made since the
Tiananmen Square massacre, with a subsidy value of more than $11
million.
   Explaining the pending decision on the satellites, Fitzwater
said Bush's freeze on sales of military weapons and defense
articles was not intended to disrupt normal commercial relations.
   Referring to the satellites, Fitzwater said, ``We recognize that
some items captured in the suspension here have civilian
applications and fall in the category of normal commercial
exports.''
   Two of the satellites are being built by the Hughes Aircraft Co.
in a joint project with Australia. The third satellite is being
refurbished by Hughes for AsiaSat, a British-Chinese consortium.
   Fitzwater said he was not aware of any softening in the U.S.
opposition to granting World Bank loans to China.
   Bush said China's record of human rights abuses are not a
barrier to better relations with the United States.
   ``We have contacts with countries that have egregious records on
human rights,'' Bush said Monday, explaining his decision to send a
high-level delegation to Beijing seeking ``new impetus and vigor''
in Sino-U.S. relations.
   He pledged to ``keep looking for ways to find common ground.''
   ``Generally speaking, I realize the difficulty of this
relationship but I don't want to make it any worse,'' Bush said.
``I'd like to think it would improve.''
   He said, however, his initiative had not produced ``total
normalization'' of relations and that an array of sanctions remain
in place.
   Meanwhile, the sponsor of legislation permitting Chinese
students to remain in the United States if they fear retaliation at
home said Congress will attempt to override Bush's veto as soon as
it reconvenes next month.
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she has received assurances
the veto override attempt will receive top priority from House and
Senate leaders.
   ``I think we have enough (votes) to override,'' she told a news
conference, saying she is receiving commitments from both Democrats
and Republicans.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell condemned the U.S.
overture to Beijing as ``embarrassing kowtowing to the Chinese
government.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``The administration supports human
rights in its words. It does not do so in its deeds. ... These
actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human
rights and are inconsistent with our stated ideals.''
   Bush defended his action during a meeting with newspaper
editorial page editors.
   Elsewhere on the foreign policy front, the president said he
would do nothing to force the issue of German reunification.
   ``It's too sensitive and it's not the role for the United States
to do that,'' Bush said, suggesting the day has long passed when
either the U.S. president or the Soviet leader had a role on the
issue of European boundaries.
   He underscored his hope that a drug summit can be held next
February in Colombia, despite recent violence there, saying he
wanted no part of sending a signal that Colombian President
Virgilio Barco ``cannot provide the proper security.''
   Bush also said the United States does not favor any step that
would force Israel to be ``pressured into negotiating'' with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, despite Secretary of State James
A. Baker III's efforts to help formulate a way to get Middle East
peace talks going.
   Bush met with the editors after receiving a briefing from Brent
Scowcroft, his national security adviser, who returned Monday from
a weekend visit to Beijing. He was accompanied on the trip by
Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state.
   The trip represented an about-face in U.S. demands that China
take the first step to repair the breach in relations. For its
part, China had bitterly rejected the U.S. criticism and a series
of American sanctions as amounting to interference in its internal
affairs.

<HEAD>Federal Court Keeps Landmark Desegregation Case Alive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keeping alive the landmark Brown vs. Board of
Education case, a federal appeals court has ruled that Topeka,
Kan., has not done enough to end school segregation, a court
official said today.
   The decision Monday by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a judge's ruling in Topeka's favor.
   Only participants in the case got copies. The ruling was
expected to be released to the general public later today.
   But Patrick Fisher, deputy chief clerk of the appeals court,
said the court ruled some elements of segregation still exist in
the Topeka school system, and it sent the case back to federal
court in Kansas to come up with a remedy.
   The appeals court recognized that Topeka has made progress in
recent years but said that the school system is engaged in ``benign
neglect'' and is not meeting the court's requirements, Fisher said.
   The ruling could jeopardize federal funds coming into the
district.
   The appeals court had issued a similar ruling in the case June 2
but withdrew the decison the following month without explanation.
   Both sides in the case said Monday they would study the ruling
before announcing their next move.
   The original lawsuit challenged a Kansas law authorizing school
segregation. The 1954 Supreme Court decision striking down the law
paved the way for nationwide school desegregation.
   In 1979, however, the case was revived by black parents who
claimed Topeka had failed to segregate its schools. The plaintiffs
included Linda Brown Buckner, who was a youngster when her name
went on the original lawsuit 25 years ago.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers ruled in 1987 that remaining
racial imbalances in Topeka's schools were the result of housing
patterns, not school board action.

   Thanks to determination, donations and a
lot of hard work, people in the town of Wanette finally have town
decorations to prove they have the Christmas spirit.
   The Pottawatomie County town of about 500 has been too poor to
afford Yule decorations for several years.
   This year, they ran an advertisement in the November issue of
Oklahoma Cities &amp; Towns, appealing for donated decorations from
other communities.
   The ad got no response.
   That got people worked up, and local merchants chipped in to
provide wood that Future Farmers of America members and other high
school students used to build large candles and other decorations.
   Grade-schoolers made decorations for a 15-foot cedar tree
brought in by a local farmer to put in the middle of town. Several
residents brought lights to go with the students' tree decorations.
And several children painted seasonal designs on doors nd windows
of businesses.
   ``It just all came together. I've seen more life here in the
last month than I've seen in the last four or five years,'' said
Rachella Larman, a local flower shop operator.
   ``Everybody's gotten excited about it and gotten on the band
wagon _ everybody helped,'' she said. ``I don't think we've all
been out but about $200 cash, and everything else has been
donated.''

   An abandoned kitten taken in by a woman
last August has returned the favor by alerting the woman to a fire
and saving her life.
   Mamie Pasden, 78, said she had been sleeping soundly Sunday when
the cat, named Baby, woke her up.
   ``I remember this kitten started scratching my head and face,''
Pasden said. ``So when I finally opened my eyes I said, `What's
wrong, Baby?'
   ``I could see the ceiling was all orange and I thought, `Boy,
the sun's out early.'''
   Then she realized it was a reflection of flames and fled from
the house, stopping to make sure she had the cat.
   ``I wasn't going to leave that cat even if I had to die trying
to save her,'' Pasden said. ``It was the least I could do for her
saving me.''
   Pasden lost everything in the fire and has been staying with
neighbors. She has received numerous donations, including $25 from
a stranger.
   ``He said, `Buy food for the kitten. She's special,''' Pasden
said.

   A pair of dog tags that lay forgotten
in an English forest for 45 years have been returned to their
original owner with the help of a British treasure hunter.
   ``It was amazing. It was something I never anticipated,'' said
John Kawa, who lost the identification chain while he was an
American corporal training in Britain for D-Day.
   ``You never know what you're going to come across in life,''
Kawa said Monday.
   The tags were lost in the spring of 1944 in a Wiltshire forest.
Kawa said he took them off because the swinging chain got in his
way while he tried to wash in a helmet full of water, and he then
forgot them in the rush of exercises.
   Last summer, a letter arrived at the old family house in
Springfield, where Kawa's sister, Anna, now lives.
   ``I opened the letter and I said, `I know what it is,''' said
Kawa, who knew by the heading of the letter, which copied the style
of the dog tags that listed his mother's name and his name.
   ``I knew right then and there it was the dog tags,'' Kawa said.
   The letter was from Keith R. Genever of Wiltshire, who said he
found the chain and tags while pursuing his hobby of treasure
hunting with a metal detector.
   The two men corresponded and Kawa, now 66, got the tags back
last month.

   Ending a testy summit, five Central
American presidents today called for the demobilization of El
Salvador's leftist guerrillas along with the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   ``This is a blow against those who want war,'' President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua said.
   The presidents said the United Nations should play a key role,
arranging more direct U.S. and Soviet roles in regional peace
efforts and overseeing the demobilization of the Salvadoran and
Contra rebels.
   In a communique issued at the end of the two-day gathering, the
presidents urged the Salvadoran insurgents to cease all operations
that endanger civilians and to join the peaceful political process.
   The agreement expressed support for El Salvador's rightist
government as a government ``born out of a democratic and
pluralistic process.''
   It condemned ``armed activities and terrorism by irregular
forces in the region'' and said the leftist guerrillas should
resume talks with the government.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration had not yet analyzed all of the parts of the
communique, but that generally, ``We have concerns about it.''
   ``We're certainly skeptical. We remain to be convinced,'' he
said, citing evidence that Nicaragua is unwilling to live up to its
commitments about democratic reforms.
   Fitzwater said the fact that Nicaragua agreed not to support the
Marxist rebels in El Salvador was ``encouraging.''
   The statement was the leaders' strongest call for an end to the
bitter civil war that has flared with renewed vigor in El Salvador
in recent weeks.
   The presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras urged El
Salvador and Nicaragua to mend their tattered relations.
   El Salvador suspended relations with Nicaragua on Nov. 26 after
a Nicaraguan-registered plane loaded with anti-aircraft missiles
that was allegedly destined for the Salvadoran rebels crashed.
   The accord was reached after a four-hour delay caused when
President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras stormed out of the summit,
then agreed to return after settling a dispute with Nicaragua.
   Azcona had been angered by Nicaragua's refusal to drop its case
in the World Court that accuses Honduras of harboring U.S.-backed
Contra rebels. Azcona returned after Nicaragua said it would
suspend the case for six months. The suspension was included in the
final communique.
   The communique also said the presidents would meet in the first
part of 1990 in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital.
   ``There has never been a summit like this, such a climate of
confrontation,'' said Costa Rican information minister, Jorge
Urbana.
   The four-hour breakdown in the talks illustrates the fragility
of the peace process and the deep divisions among the Central
American leaders.
   Sources close to the talks had said the most the five presidents
had hoped for was an agreement that kept the peace process alive,
not one that actually solved any of the region's conflicts.
   In a message to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias on Monday,
Pope John Paul II expressed his hopes for peace but noted the
summit came ``during a time of new tensions and painful conflicts''
in Central America.
   Arias, Azcona and presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Alfredo
Cristiani of El Salvador and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala attended
the summit. Neither the Contras nor the Salvadoran rebels were
represented.
   The presidents agreed in August to disband the Contras by Dec. 5
in exchange for democratization and a Feb. 25 election in
Nicaragua, but the Contras _ most of whom are camped in Hondoras _
defied the agreement.
   Momentum toward peace has slowed since October, with fighting
renewed in both El Salvador and Nicaragua, the suspension of
diplomatic ties between the two countries and increasing campaign
violence in Nicaragua.
   Nicaragua is demanding the Contras be demobilized by Honduras or
through a reinforced U.N. force. Honduras says it wants to disband
the force, but won't use its army or shed Honduran blood to do it.
   A U.N. observer group has been sent to verify the peaceful
repatriation of the Contras to Nicaragua and make sure no weapons
are sent from one country to another to help insurgent groups.
   The Contras say no guarantees of democracy or freedom exist for
them inside Nicaragua and their presence is the only guarantee the
Feb. 25 vote will be fair.

<HEAD>Raja, Sri Lanka's Beloved Elephant, Lives on Through Taxidermy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANDY, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buddhists on Tuesday unveiled a stuffed
version of Raja, a sacred elephant whose death in 1988 plunged Sri
Lanka into mourning.
   The grand old elephant, who after $4,000 worth of taxidermy work
looked more robust than in his last years of life, stood
majestically inside the Budhhist temple with two strings of white
flowers hanging from his tusks.
   Hundreds of devotees mingled with saffron-robed monks for the
unveiling by Prime Minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunga.
   Raja, whose name means ``king'' in the Sinhalese language, was
declared a national treasure by former President Junius R.
Jayewardene.
   For 50 years before dying at age 82, Raja was the center of
attention in Kandy's Buddhist annual pageant, which runs for two
weeks in late July and early August.
   The pageant, which started in 1775, transforms the central hill
town into a maelstrom of color, light and human confusion
intermingled with the solemnity of ancient religious rituals.
   The focus of the pageant is a tooth, revered by believers as a
physical relic of the Lord Buddha. According to legend, the tooth
was smuggled into Sri Lanka in the 4th century A.D. for safekeeping
during the siege of Dantapura, capital of the ancient Indian
kingdom of Kalinga.
   The relic, often called Sri Lanka's most prized posession, is
kept in the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, 55 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Once a year, during the pageant, it is placed in a golden casket
and paraded around the town on the back of the temple's premier
pachyderm, his tusks sheathed in gold and jewels. White cloth is
spread on the streets of Kandy, and the procession includes two
lesser elephants, each carrying an attendant to throw sweet-scented
jasmine flowers over the precious casket.
   Raja's successor is an elephant named Indiraja _ the ``king from
India'' _ a present from the government of India, where the
Buddhist faith began.
   Barely 24 hours after Raja died, his skin was removed and
preserved. Coconut fiber, plaster of Paris, cardboard and glue were
used to recreate his original size and shape, said Thelma
Gunawardana, director of the Department of National Museums.
   ``It was a gigantic task,'' Mrs. Gunawardana said. ``It took
four months for a five-member team to taxidermize the 9{-foot tall,
11-foot long elephant.''
   In the room with Raja were photographs from his heyday and a
replica of the golden casket.
   Raja will remain on display in a building next to the Temple of
the Tooth.
   ``If we continue to take care of the elephant, we could preserve
it for a century or even more,'' Mrs. Gunawardana said.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III met today with East Germany's reformist premier, becoming the
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Communist nation in
nearly two decades.
   Earlier, Baker celebrated the opening of the Berlin Wall and
outlined ``a new architecture'' for a changing Europe, with a
larger role for NATO and closer U.S. ties to the Western military
alliance.
   Baker and East German Premier Hans Modrow met for an hour in the
Sans Souci room of the Potsdam Hotel.
   ``I felt that it was important that we have an opportunity to
let the premier and the people of East Germany know of our support
for the reforms which are taking place in this country,'' Baker
said later.
   ``We also wanted to make it very clear that we support the
process of reform in a peaceful manner and that we are very anxious
to see this process move forward in a stable way,'' he said.
   Modrow, 61, said East Germany saw Baker's visit ``without a
doubt'' as support for reform.
   ``This visit is a political sign that the U.S. follows the
developments in the DDR (East Germany) with attention,'' Modrow
said. ``We started a dialogue with each other today.''
   Modrow was named premier Nov. 13 of an East Germany in the midst
of a stunning upheaval that is sweeping aside orthodox Communism.
   It was in Potsdam, southwest of the divided city of Berlin, that
the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain met in 1945 for a
conference to determine Germany's future after the Nazi defeat in
World War II.
   Baker became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit East
Germany since diplomatic relations were established in 1974. Two
secretaries of state, John Foster Dulles in the 1950s and William
P. Rogers in the early 1970s, went to East Berlin.
   Before driving over the Glienicke Bridge from West Berlin to
Potsdam, Baker visited Potsdamer Platz, where a new crossing point
in the Berlin Wall was opened last month.
   ``It's pretty impressive,'' he said as he toured the site with
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on a cold
late-autumn day.
   Demonstrators nearby protested against U.S. policies in Central
America, shouting ``Yankees out of El Salvador.''
   It was not immediately clear how the Baker visit would strike
Moscow, which has become increasingly wary of any signs of possible
German reunification and of Western influence on the events in East
Germany.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who met with Baker earlier,
and Genscher have both sought to reassure the Soviets that a
reunified Germany would not pose a security threat to any other
European state.
   But Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last week
sharply warned Genscher that reunification could only bring trouble.
   Shevardnadze recalled the suffering of the Soviets in the German
invasion in World War II and told Genscher that ``propaganda about
a federation of two Germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the
current circumstances.''
   The Soviets denounced Kohl's recent 10-point plan for eventual
reunification as ``fraught with dangerous consequences and
bordering on outright diktat.''
   U.S. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., also arranged to see Modrow later in the day.
   In a policy speech to the Berlin Press Club, Baker said ``the
United States and Canada share Europe's neighborhood'' and intend
to work with West Europeans to peacefully integrate a reunified
Germany into a Europe in which East-West tensions are subsiding.
   Baker has been pushing for a go-slow approach to German
reunification, saying the future of the two Germanys should not be
determined exclusively by the German people.
   Baker suggested NATO oversee reductions of troops and armaments
in a treaty being negotiated with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and
take new steps to build economic and political ties with the East.
   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation
must adapt,'' Baker said in the prepared speech. ``Working
together, we must design and gradually put into place an
architecture for a new era.''
   The speech was designed to reassure nervous Western allies as
German reunification moves closer to reality.
   Baker discussed the situation with Kohl at breakfast.
   In the speech, Baker said reunification ``must be peaceful, it
must be democratic, it must respect the legitimate concerns of all
the participants in the new Europe.''
   A senior U.S. official told reporters the Soviet Union's rights,
particularly in administering Berlin as part of an arrangement
among the four World War II Allies, also must be respected.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Baker
was offering no prescription for similar changes in the Warsaw
Pact. But Gorbachev has also been talking about a new Europe as the
old Communist institutions in the East fall away.
   Baker urged the 15 U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to establish a staff to verify arms control agreements
and to monitor compliance with a treaty Bush and Gorbachev hope
will be completed next year. The superpower leaders are expected to
set ceilings of 275,000 U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe and make
sharp reductions in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.
   Also, he said, as the East-West confrontation recedes, NATO
should take on a new mission of helping to resolve regional
conflicts and to stem the proliferation of missiles, chemical and
biological weapons.
   Baker said the Western alliance also stands as a model to
nations of the East. Over four decades, he said, ``It has offered a
vision of cooperation, not coercion; of open borders, not iron
curtains.''

<HEAD>North Has Trouble Separating Own Experiences From Poindexter Testimony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North told a
court today he is having difficulty separating his own experiences
in the Iran-Contra scandal from the testimony that ex-national
security adviser John Poindexter gave Congress under immunity from
prosecution.
   At a pre-trial hearing in the criminal case against Poindexter,
North said Poindexter's five-day appearance on Capitol Hill in July
1987 constituted some of the most ``powerful'' testimony of the
congressional hearings into the scandal and that he watched it
closely.
   ``I read the transcript'' of Poindexter's testimony, said North,
who Iran-Contra prosecutors want to use as a government witness in
Poindexter's trial.
   Under a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, the government may make no
use of a defendant's testimony that was compelled under a limited
grant of immunity from prosecution. That includes testimony given
by other witnesses who may have been influenced by the immunized
statements.
   Today's hearing was called so that U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene can determine whether North was tainted by Poindexter's
testimony.
   The former National Security Council aide, returning to the
courthouse where he was convicted of three felonies, initially
invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when
called to the witness stand.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh then obtained
from Greene an order compelling North to testify in exchange for a
promise not to prosecute him for his statements, as long as he
tells the truth.
   North said he was unable to recall crucial details that
prosecutors want to focus on in their case against Poindexter.
   He said he was unable to remember telling Poindexter about false
statements in letters to Congress denying that North was assisting
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua when such aid was banned by law.
   ``Did you have discussions with Admiral Poindexter before the
letter was sent ... about the false nature of the response?'' asked
Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb.
   ``I don't recall,'' North replied.
   Poindexter faces trial Jan. 22 on criminal charges of conspiracy
and two counts each of obstructing Congress and making false
statements in connection with Iran-Contra.
   Poindexter told Congress that he made no effort to prevent North
from destroying a notebook containing information about a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter also testified that he withheld information from
Congress on National Security Council activities to aid the Contras
in order to avoid publicity and more restrictive legislation. In
1985 and 1986, Congress banned military aid to the rebel force by
U.S. intelligence agencies.
   The former national security adviser is accused of falsely
telling Congress that no one in the U.S. government knew until 1986
that the 1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawks. He also is accused
of falsely denying to Congress that North and the NSC staff didn't
solicit funds or offer tactical advice to the Contras.
   North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, accepting an illegal gratuity and of destroying
government documents.
   He was sentenced July 5 to 1,200 hours of community service and
a $150,000 fine. North is appealing the convictions and the fine
while serving the community service in an anti-drug program.
   On Monday, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh disclosed that
President Bush had turned aside Walsh's request for a face-to-face
meeting with the president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that the
decision against a meeting with Walsh ``was the recommendation of
counsel (White House counsel Boyden Gray), which the president
accepted and agrees with. We should not be involved in the legal
process and the court system.''
   Fitzwater said the cases themselves and legal ramifications
``are subjects that should be discussed between the attorney
general, who is the president's lawyer, and the independent
counsel.''
   ``On substance, our responsiblity is to protect classified
information an to protect methods and sources and so forth that are
part ofthat and we feel we have to meet that responsiblity and have
done so,'' Fitzwater said.
   In a report to Congress, the Iran-Contra prosecutor revealed
that he wrote Bush on Oct. 19, saying that the administration was
engaging in ``interference'' by invoking national security concerns
in the case against a former CIA station chief, Joseph Fernandez.
   ``Without your help the rule of law will be subordinated to the
intelligence effort,'' wrote Walsh. ``The tail has begun to wag the
dog.''

   Fifty-one Vietnamese migrants were pulled from
their beds by security forces before dawn and flown to Hanoi today
in Hong Kong's first forced repatriation of boat people. Vietnam
accepted them but criticized the action.
   British and colonial officials, ignoring last-minute pleas from
the United States, Canada and the human rights group Amnesty
International, said it was more humane to ship the Vietnamese home
than to keep them ``endlessly.''
   Some of the Vietnamese screamed for help and one woman waved her
hands and cried, ``I don't want to back to Vietnam!''
   Several thousand more will be returned within weeks, said Hong
Kong television, quoting an unidentified Vietnamese Foreign
Ministry official. A government statement said officials were
considering using ships.
   The British colony currently houses 56,000 Vietnamese in squalid
camps where violence and malnutrition are rife. Among them, 44,000
are considered illegal immigrants and will be sent home unless they
can prove they would face persecution in Vietnam. Hong Kong says
the refugees have strained its facilities.
   Most are considered economic refugees. Many risked their lives
in fleeing the poverty of their homeland, putting out to sea in
rickety boats.
   Japan's Kyodo New Service in Tokyo quoted a Vietnamese Foreign
Ministry statement in Hanoi as saying Vietnam accepts voluntary
returnees but ``will refuse flatly forced repatriation.''
   It said the Hong Kong action this time ``violates
humanitarianism'' but that the 51 Vietnamese returned against their
will would be accepted.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons in
London that the forcible repatriation is ``perfectly in order'' and
that countries which object should offer them a home.
   In Washington, the Bush administration today denounced the
return as unacceptable.
   ``We continue to support the voluntary repatriation of
asylum-seekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of action
adopted by the Red Cross,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Many U.S. lawmakers expressed outrage at the deportations.
   ``This conjures up every picture I have in my mind of World War
II concentration camps,'' said Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass.
   The jetliner arrived in Hanoi four hours after riot police
entered a detention center and took the Vietnamese under tight
security and the cover of darkness.
   Vietnamese screamed for help from the windows at the Phoenix
House detention center during the roundup. Some hung a sign through
the metal bars, reading: ``Where is your humanity?''
   The boat people were quickly pulled away by police, who were
equipped with helmets, shields, revolvers and batons. Sobs could be
heard coming from the cells.
   Some held their heads in their hands.
   The plane carried eight Vietnamese men, 17 women and 26
children, the government said in a statement today.
   It said the boat people were accompanied by Hong Kong officials
and that the expulsions occurred peacefully.
   ``In our view it is more humane to go ahead with the
repatriation of those who have been through the whole process of
screening and appeal than to leave them waiting endlessly in
camps,'' it said.
   A police convoy of seven trucks shipped the Vietnamese from the
detention center to Kai Tak International Airport. About 200 police
and corrections officers were involved in the operation.
   Upon arrival in Hanoi, the 51 Vietnamese were taken to a transit
center where they will be processed before returning to the
provinces for job placement and training, a diplomatic source in
Hanoi said.
   The government said the repatriation program costs about $1,000
per person, with the cost shared equally by the Hong Kong and
British governments. Each returning adult received $30 and each
child $15 with the balance given to Vietnamese authorities for
disbursal, the government said.
   The Hong Kong government statement said Vietnam has given the
colony ``firm assurances that those returning would not be punished
for having left clandestinely'' and that their return would
initially be monitored by the British Embassy in Hanoi.
   It said it hoped the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees would
watch their progress, but the relief agency today called the
mandatory repatriation program ``premature.''
   The U.N. group has coordinated a program of voluntary
repatriation in which 637 Vietnamese boat people have returned to
their Communist homeland since March.
   The United States has criticized the expulsion plan, saying
conditions must first improve inside Vietnam.
   Some in Hong Kong say forced repatriation will hurt the
territory's chances of obtaining international protection from
Communist China, which takes control of the colony in 1997.
   But Li Hou, a Chinese official speaking in Canton, hailed the
expulsions today.
   ``Forced repatriation should have been used long ago,'' said Li,
a high-ranking official responsible for Hong Kong affairs.
   Opponents of forced repatriation have argued that it could
trigger violence in the detention centers and lead some to try
suicide. Vietnamese already have staged hunger strikes and
demonstrations to protest being sent home against their will.
Several bloody riots have broken out.
   Britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boat
people from fleeing to overcrowded Hong Kong.
   More than 170,000 Vietnamese have flocked to Hong Kong since
1975, when North Vietnam seized control of South Vietnam following
the U.S. withdrawal from the Vietnam War.
   More than 34,000 arrived from Jan. 1 to Nov. 10.

   Once again, Bob Carver will spend his
Christmas vacation working _ driving a tractor-trailer rig on the
open road while playing Santa to raise money for the Salvation Army.
   Over the past seven years, Carver has logged nearly 80,000 miles
on his ``Santa Express'' during his vacation from the U.S.
Waterways Experiment Station.
   ``I love to drive a truck and this project promotes good will,''
Carver said. ``Probably the biggest kick I get is watching the kids
when they see the truck or me with my Santa's hat.''
   Every year at this time, he takes a temporary job with a
trucking company hauling cargo long distance. Sponsors pledge to
pay so much per mile of his trip to the Salvation Army. Sometimes
he is greeted by children at his destination and dons a Santa
outfit for them.
   Carver, a licensed commercial driver as well as a research
engineer, donates his trucking pay check to the Vicksburg Salvation
Army. That has amounted to almost $27,000 over the past seven years.
   This year, he will be accompanied by his wife, Ruth, who also
drives a truck. The couple married in October.
   ``We'll have a good time and my five-year-old grandson, Chris,
is going with us. I can help Bob with some of the driving,'' said
Mrs. Carver, who drove a truck for five years.
   The Carvers will leave Monday en route to Boston in an
18-wheeler which has ``Santa Express'' signs on the doors. They
plan to be back in Vicksburg in time for Christmas.
   This year, White Heavy Express of Pearl is sponsoring the long
haul. Carver said several businesses in the Jackson area have
pledged 2 cents per mile and he hopes to get Vicksburg businesses
to do the same so he can raise about $3,000.

<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts of the policy
speech given Tuesday by U.S. Secretary Of State James A. Baker III
to the Berlin Press Club in West Berlin.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation
must adapt. Working together, we must design and gradually put into
place a new architecture for a new era. ...
   ``This new architecture must have a place for old foundations
and structures that remain valuable _ like NATO _ while recognizing
that they can also serve new collective purposes. The new
architecture must continue the construction of institutions _ like
the EC _ that can help draw together the West while also serving as
an open door to the East. ...
   ``This new structure must also accomplish two special purposes.
First, as a part of overcoming the division of Europe there must be
an opportunity to overcome through peace and freedom the division
of Berlin and of Germany. The United States and NATO have stood for
unification for 40 years, and we will not waver from that goal. ...
   ``As an American, I am proud of the role my nation has played
and will continue to play standing with you. Yet this very positive
course will not be easy, nor can it be rushed. It must be peaceful.
It must be democratic. It must respect the legitimate concerns of
all the participants in the new Europe. ...
   ``NATO may have its greatest and most lasting effect on the
pattern of change by demonstrating to the nations of the East a
fundamentally different approach to security. NATO's four decades
offer a vision of cooperation, not coercion; of open borders, not
iron curtains. The reconciliation of ancient enemies, which has
taken place under the umbrella of NATO's collective security,
offers the nations of Eastern Europe an appealing model of
international relations. ...
   ``As Europe moves toward its goal of a common internal market,
and as its institutions for political and security cooperation
evolve, the link between the United States and the European
Community will become even more important. We want our
trans-Atlantic cooperation to keep pace with European integration
and institutional reform. ...
   ``I am confident that creative new arrangements can be devised
to encourage and sustain the process of political and economic
reform in the countries of Eastern Europe, while at the same time
preserving the integrity and the vitality of existing institutions.
We need to offer the nations of the East hope, opportunities that
can be seized as they take steps toward democracy and economic
liberty. ...
   ``We see no conflict between the process of European integration
and an expansion of cooperation between the European Community and
its neighbors to the East and West. Indeed, we believe that the
attraction of the European Community for the countries of the East
depends most on its continued vitality. And the vitality of the
Economic Community depends in turn on its continued commitment to
the goal of a united Europe envisaged by its founders _ free,
democratic and closely linked to its North American partners.''

<HEAD>Nunn Complains Reduced Military Threat Not Considered in Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharply reduced U.S. intelligence estimates of
the potential military threat posed by the Soviet Union and Warsaw
Pact were never factored into the process of drafting the Pentagon
budget, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee said Tuesday.
   The result, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., was that members of
Congress responsible for approving the defense budget were misled,
perhaps inadvertently.
   ``I don't say it was a deliberate coverup,'' Nunn told
reporters. ``What happened here is that the intelligence estimate
didn't get plugged into their own process.''
   But he said congressional budget writers were mislead
nonetheless.
   ``When you don't have the accurate intelligence estimate, I
think it is a misleading budget,'' Nunn said.
   The complaints from Nunn and other committee members about the
credibility of the budget process came as a senior Pentagon
official confirmed that a new threat estimate by the U.S.
intelligence community, in preparation for months, concludes that
the Soviets would take significantly longer than previously
believed to ready forces to invade Western Europe.
   However, Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense for policy
planning, said that the principal reason for the longer warning
time is the improvement of the reinforcement capabilities of the
United States and its NATO allies.
   Wolfowitz said that using this longer warning time as a basis on
which to immediately cut U.S. military forces would be
short-sighted and counterproductive. Deep cuts could erase the
longer warning time and erode NATO defenses, he said.
   Reducing NATO's military punch too soon might lead Moscow to
conclude it could gain a decisive military advantage by moving
quickly, Wolfowitz said.
   At the same time, he said, U.S. military planners are working
under the assumption that political changes in Eastern Europe and
the anticipated successful outcome of conventional arms reduction
talks in Vienna will eventually lead to a sharply reduced military
threat.
   But he said that may not be fully evident for four or five years.
   Wolfowitz declined to confirm reports published in The
Washington Post last month that the U.S. intelligence community
believes NATO would have between 33 to 44 days of warning time
before a Soviet attack, a change from previous estimates that a
``standing start'' invasion would require only two weeks of
mobilization.
   Wolfowitz did confirm that for the first time since the rise of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the United States sees
evidence of actual reductions in overall Soviet military spending.
   But he said that is taking place largely in the conventional
field, with spending on strategic nuclear and naval forces
remaining level. That cannot serve as the rationale for deep cuts
in U.S. forces because of ``the incompleteness and reversibility''
of the Soviet moves, he said.
   Nunn said that accurate warning-time estimates drive military
strategy, which in turn drives military budgets. They are of
``fundamental importance,'' he said.
   Nunn complained that at the time the new and reduced threat
assessment was being prepared last spring, senior military officers
were telling Congress the Soviet threat had not been reduced but
had actually worsened.
   Nunn and other senators warned that the Pentagon faces a serious
loss of credibility and possible runaway budget cutting by Congress
if it provides threat estimates that are not factual.
   ``It will be almost impossible to go out an defend a budget that
is not based on real developments in the world,'' Nunn said.

   Monday's launch of the space shuttle
Columbia on a satellite rescue mission might have to be delayed a
day or two because preparations are behind schedule, NASA said
Tuesday.
   ``The target date is still Monday, but we're on a very tight
schedule and we've got a lot of work to do,'' said space agency
spokeswoman Lisa Malone. ``We'll know more tomorrow after we finish
the hypergolic propellant loading.''
   The loading of hypergolic propellants, a fuel and oxidizer that
ignite spontaneously when mixed together, for in-flight propulsion
systems and auxiliary power units began a day late Monday because a
faulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced and
retested.
   Once the fueling began, the launch pad had to be cleared of all
non-essential personnel because it is considered a hazardous
operation. That prevented workers from making up lost time in other
areas.
   Even before the connector problem, work was running late because
of some difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launch
platform being used for the first time and on launch pad 39B, which
recently underwent a two-year, $50 million refurbishment.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 7:31 p.m. Monday with a
crew of five astronauts who are to deploy a Navy communications
satellite and track down and recover a science satellite that has
been in orbit for nearly six years.
   In announcing the Dec. 18 launch date for the 10-day mission,
which would put the astronauts in space for Christmas, NASA
cautioned last week that the flight might have to be delayed a day
or so.
   If the flight is put off more than three or four days, officials
said it probably would be postponed until after Christmas to free
workers for the holiday.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein will command Columbia's crew. The
others are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie
Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.

<TEXT>
   The leadership of East Germany's embattled
Sports Federation resigned today after criticism it was moving away
too slowly from treating sports mainly as a medal-making machine.
   Federation president Klaus Eichler said he and the rest of the
secretariat, or central administration, would step down in response
to calls for ``far-reaching programs and personnel changes,'' the
official news agency ADN said.
   Eichler admitted mistakes by the federation leadership in recent
weeks, ADN reported. The move was announced after an emergency
meeting of the federation's national leadership outside East Berlin.
   East Germany for years concentrated on pumping money into
certain high-performance sports that yielded a maximum of
individual medals in international competition, such as swimming
and track and field.
   In the course of East Germany's peaceful democratic revolt,
former star athletes have come under criticism for enjoying
privileges. Popular and official pressure has built up for funding
more sports facilities for ordinary citizens and promoting sports
previously deemed secondary by officials, such as tennis,
basketball and ice hockey.
   Speculation about corruption in the federation was fueled when
Franz Rydz, the vice president for finance, apparently drowned
himself after $162,000 was found in his desk. East German
investigators are trying to determine what the money was for.
   A statement signed by 192 athletes, including Olympic shot put
champion Ulf Timmermann, urged the sports leadership to resign
because it was unable to lead the organization at a time of rapid
change in the society.

<TEXT>
   A former Ford Motor Co. executive said
today a protective cage around the fuel tank of a church bus
probably would not have prevented a fire that killed 27 people.
   The testimony came at Larry Mahoney's trial on 27 counts of
murder in a wrong-way collision between the bus and Mahoney's
pickup. His attorneys say he unknowingly may have drunk
vodka-spiked soda pop before the May 14, 1988 crash.
   Twenty-four youngsters and three adults died in the accident on
Interstate 71 near here after flames consumed the bus from the
Radcliff First Assembly of God Church.
   Although a cage probably would not have prevented the fire,
former Ford vice president Thomas Feahney testified, ``there was
technology available that could have prevented this tragic
accident.'' He did not elaborate.
   The automotive engineer said the impact caused gasoline to
squirt ``like a flame thrower'' into the passenger section.
   On Monday, defense attorneys sought to establish that the former
school bus had safety defects that caused it to burst into flames.
The victims died of smoke inhalation or burns rather than of
injuries from the impact.
   ``Part of the defense has been the claim of involuntary
intoxication,'' defense attorney William Summers told reporters,
explaining the significance of testimony that a friend gave Mahoney
a cocktail of Diet Pepsi and vodka.
   ``To voluntarily drink something, you've got to have some idea
of what you're drinking,'' Summers said.
   Mahoney, 36, a factory worker from rural Owen County, is charged
with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42 of wanton endangerment
and one of drunken driving.
   His blood-alcohol level after the crash tested as high as 0.24
percent _ nearly 2{ times the state's definition of intoxication,
according to earlier testimony.
   Among those testifying Monday was Phil Downey, a longtime friend
of Mahoney's who was with him at a gathering he left less than an
hour before the 10:55 p.m. crash.
   Downey recalled Mahoney asking Kelly Osborne, a friend at the
gathering, what he was drinking. He said Osborne gave Mahoney a cup
of Diet Pepsi and vodka, saying, ``This is better for you than any
ld beer you ever drank.''
   Mahoney drank the mixture, Downey testified.
   Under cross-examination by Assistant Attorney General Paul
Richwalsky Jr., Downey said Mahoney appeared drunk when he drove
away.
   ``He shouldn't have been driving,'' Downey said.
   Summers said he would try to prove Mahoney didn't know what was
in the cup.
   The defense contends unsafe design of the 1977 school bus is to
blame for the deaths. A federal investigation after the crash found
the bus's exposed fuel tank prone to fire.
   Also testifying Monday was state Fire Marshal John William
Martin, who said the fire wouldn't have been prevented by a
protective cage around the bus' gas tank. The blaze erupted after a
piece of the bus's suspension punctured the tank.
   Martin said it couldn't be determined if the thick black smoke
that filled the bus and was blamed for most of the deaths was
caused by the burning of gasoline alone or the burning of plastic
seat covers and cushions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new magazine published by three teachers'
groups will give American students the chance to puzzle over the
same math and physics problems that confound Soviet high school
students, the organizations announced Tuesday.
   The English-language magazine, called Quantum, is being
published by te National Science Teachers Association, the American
Association of Physics Teachers and the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics in a joint effort with the Soviet Union's
Academy of Sciences.
   But Bill Aldridge, executive director of the NSTA, cautions that
Quantum is not for the average American student.
   ``It is aimed at students who are curious and want to solve
puzzles in physics and math,'' Aldridge said. ``It's aimed at the
very able student.''
   Most of the material in the first issue is based on articles and
problems that first appeared in Kvant, a popular Soviet magazine
for high school students.
   It includes problems in advanced geometry, algebra and in basic
physics, all presented in a lively, colorful way and applied to
actual objects and observations.
   There are also chess games and profiles of famous Soviet and
American scientists.
   ``The magazine has a little more life and is more connected to
what mathematicians really do,'' said William Thurston, a Princeton
University math professor who is the Quantum editor for
mathematics. He said the magazine will offer advanced problems in
math and physics that students normally would not confront in a
typical high school classroom.
   Aldridge said that Kvant carries articles and problems written
by top Soviet scientists and are designed to challenge Soviet
students.
   ``In the Soviet Union, ambitious parents subscribe for their
children, hoping that they can get them into the university,''
Aldridge said.
   Eventually, he said, it is hoped that American scientists will
contribute articles to Quantum that would later be translated for
use in Kvant.
   Aldridge said a computer and a laser printer, donated by the
Americans, have been installed in the Soviet offices of Kvant so
that articles can be transmitted by satellite to the Quantum
editorial offices in Washington.
   Aldridge said President Bush presented the first copy of Quantum
to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when the two met for their
shipboard summit in Malta.
   The first edition carries little advertising, and Aldridge said
it will take about three years for the magazine to reach the
break-even point economically. Until then, it is being supported by
a $366,000 National Science Foundation grant.
   The magazine will be published quarterly and the annual
subscription rate is $9.95.

   Kidnappers who agreed to release a
Cabinet minister's daughter in exchange for jailed Moslem
separatists demanded that the site for the swap be changed,
officials said Tuesday.
   Thousands of people gathered in the neighborhood called Bauri
Kadal, in this northern city near the Pakistan border, anticipating
the release of the militants. Some demonstrators set off
firecrackers and a few groups shouted anti-India slogans.
   The separatist Kashmir Liberation Front, which claimed
responsibility for kidnapping Rubaiya Saeed, 22, on Friday, is
demanding the release of five to seven militants, including Abdul
Hamid Sheikh, the group's leader.
   After initial haggling, the two sides agreed at midday to
conduct the swap at an isolated site, but the kidnappers later
reneged on the agreement, according to a top Jammu-Kashmir state
police officer in Jammu, about 95 miles south of Srinagar.
   The kidnappers want the jailed militants released at Bauri
Kadal, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. They
promised to free Ms. Sayeed later at an unspecified place, he said.
   The state's chief secretary, Moosa Raza, refused comment on
this. ``We have a lot of proposals but I cannot disclose them
now,'' he said.
   Ms. Saeed was kidnapped at gunpoint in Srinagar. Her father is
Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who oversees internal security.
   The abduction triggered the first crisis for the 10-day-old
government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who last week appointed
Sayeed, a Moslem, as part of an effort to appease Moslems in this
mainly Hindu nation.
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, which wants Jammu-Kashmir to
either become independent or part of Islamic Pakistan, commands a
large following in the Moslem-dominated Srinagar.
   The front, formed in 1965, has often attacked the government and
sponsored successful strikes in Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem
majority state.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Will Review Uranium Sale to Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee will review the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's decision to sell weapons-grade uranium to
Romania, a hard-line East Bloc country that has been harshly
criticized by the United States, a Capitol Hill source said Tuesday.
   One opponent called the sale ``crazy;'' another said the uranium
could be used to make a nuclear bomb.
   The 16.4 kilograms of uranium at issue is slated to go to the
Triga research reactor outside Bucharest. The facility is used for
training, basic research and the production of radioactive isotopes
commonly used for medical tests _ but not for weapons.
   The sale was approved in August 1988, but U.S. officials have
refused to ship the uranium, stored at Oak Ridge, Tenn., until the
Romanians come up with a safe way to transport the deadly material.
   Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, a group opposed to nuclear proliferation, said the
material could be used for a bomb.
   ``In light of the Romanians' increasing isolation and
instability, this is not the time to be sending Romania the means
to make an atomic bomb,'' he said. The ``real risk is that Romania
will sell it to terrorists for hard currency,'' he said.
   ``I think it's crazy,'' Vladimir Tismaneanu, a resident scholar
at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said of
the sale.
   Tismaneanu said the United States should not provide ``any
encouragement'' to Nicolae Ceausescu, the unpredictable Romanian
leader who has curtailed religious, speech and travel freedoms.
   Ceausescu has scorned the economic and social reforms sweeping
Eastern Europe, preferring a Stalin-like approach to governing.
   Relations between Bucharest and Washington have been ``severely
strained'' recently by Romania's poor human rights record, the
State Department said in a statement. ``We would like to see
Romania join its neighbors in moving towards political and economic
reforms.''
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will look at the sale
to make sure the Romanians need the uranium to keep the Triga
reactor operating rather than as a reserve supply, according to an
aide, who spoke on the condition on anonymity.
   The panel, which has held hearings on the export of nuclear
material, will also check to satisfy any questions about safeguards
on the uranium.
   The State Department said it is confident Romania will use and
store the uranium safely.
   ``Appropriate physical security measures are being applied to
the highly enriched uranium in Romania and will be applied to any
additional nuclear material shipped to that country,'' the
department said.
   U.S. officials say Romania met all requirements for the sale.
   ``We have been shipping fuel to Romania for a number of years,''
said Joseph Fouchard, a spokesman for the NRC. ``We monitor the
safeguards, take a look at their security.''
   The commission approved a license for the uranium shipment after
it received the go-ahead from the Reagan administration, Fouchard
said.
   The uranium is part of a batch that was sold to Romania in 1978,
officials said. That year, the United States shipped 38 kilograms
to Bucharest for use at the Triga reactor.
   The Romanians also paid for the additional 16.4 kilograms, to be
held in the United States until needed. The NRC must issue licenses
for the export of uranium. State Department officials said they did
not know how much Romania paid for the material.
   An official at the Romanian Embassy did not respond to questions
about the uranium.

   This year's White House Christmas card depicts
the snow-covered South Portico of the presidential mansion
decorated for Christmas.
   The card is a reproduction of a watercolor by artist William T.
Gemmell, who has directed the White House's Office of Graphics and
Calligraphy since 1977.
   The scene shows the White House draped in greenery with a single
wreath and red bow hanging from the Truman Balcony. The White House
Christmas tree is visible through the windows of the Blue Room.
   The message inside reads: ``The President and Mrs. Bush extend
their warmest wishes that Christmas and the New Year will hold much
happiness and peace for you and those you love.''
   As many as 150,000 cards will be mailed over the next week, with
the Republican National Committee picking up the cost of both
printing and mailing. The cards were printed by Hallmark.
   It is the first time that Gemmell's art has been featured on a
White House Christmas card.
   The Reagans sent 125,000 cards last year.
   Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the RNC, said it is not known
how much the card mailing will cost.
   ``We don't know until the bills come in. That's about a month
from now,'' she said.

   Deutsche Bank on Tuesday named
Hilmar Kopper as its new chairman to succeed Alfred Herrhausen, who
was killed in a terrorist attack Nov. 30.
   Kopper, 54, had been widely mentioned as the most likely
successor to Herrhausen to head West Germany's largest bank.
   Some analysts had predicted that he would be joined by a second
chairman _ a system that was in place until the retirement of F.
Wilhelm Christians in 1988 _ but Kopper will be the sole chairman.
   Kopper joined the board in 1976, where he focused on
international commercial banking. In January 1988, he took over
most of Deutsche Bank's investment-banking operations and was put
in charge of its North American activities.
   Recently, he played a key role in negotiating the $645 million
takeover of Morgan Grenfell PLC in London, completed shortly before
Herrhausen's death.
   Herrhausen was killed by a terrorist bomb as he was being driven
to work from his home in Bad Homburg, about 12 miles north of
Frankfurt.West Germany's extreme-leftist Red Army Faction terrorist
group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<HEAD>American Gets Suspended Sentence For Smuggling Soviet Gold, Jewels</HEAD>

   An American was convicted of trying to smuggle
more than $92,000 worth of gold, jewels and currency out of the
Soviet Union but received a suspended sentence Tuesday, Tass
reported.
   Martin Mendelson, 24, of Washington, D.C., was caught at
Leningrad airport Sept. 25 trying to fly to Finland without
declaring money, ``items of gold and silver and jewels worth a
great sum,'' the official news agency said.
   He had been held in jail since then but was released Tuesday
after a court gave him a three-year sentence and ordered some of
the valuables confiscated, Tass said.
   Mendelson, a tour guide for the New York-based Russian Travel
Bureau, had been trying to get the valuables out of the Soviet
Union for Maya Bogdadlishvili, 31, of Moscow, Tass said. She also
was given a suspended sentence.
   Tass said the court took into account the fact that the
defendants pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions.
   Soviet customs procedures have become less strict in the last
year. Travelers arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport even have
the option of passing through a ``nothing-to-declare'' customs line.
   They are still required to declare valuables and foreign
currency, and the restrictions on what travelers can take out of
the Soviet Union have been tightened lately to prevent sorely
needed consumer goods from leaving the shortage-ridden country.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. and Soviet military conducted their
first communication tests last week under an agreement designed to
prevent potentially dangerous clashes, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   ``It's a reflection of an increased element of trust,'' said
spokesman Pete Williams. ``It's a recognition of the force that
both sides have and an attempt to avoid any accidents from being
caused by the inability to communicate with the other side.''
   The Dec. 6-8 exercise was designed to demonstrate the two
nations' armed forces can cooperate in anticipation of an agreement
scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1.
   The pact was signed last summer by Soviet Gen. Mikhail A.
Moiseyev and then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.
William Crowe, who worked in recent years to increase contact
between the superpower militaries.
   Williams said the tests involved ships, aircraft and
ground-based air traffic control and monitoring facilities of both
U.S. and Soviet armed forces.
   ``Despite bad weather in the Bering Sea, the tests were
successful,'' Williams said. ``They demonstrated radio
interoperability and the procedures that have been worked out by
both sides to prevent potentially dangerous military incidents or
to quickly resolve them should they occur.''
   Williams said that U.S. and Soviet aircraft met at specific
locations ``and talked to each other. They communicated directly to
each other.''
   ``It's a first,'' he said of the tests.
   The tests over the Bering Sea _ which divides Alaska from the
Soviet Union _ included the aircraft from each nation flying over
the other's territory.
   The aircraft ``communicated with both interceptor aircraft there
and ground-based traffic control and monitoring facilities'' of the
other nation, Williams said.
   In the Mediterranean, the two sides conducted ``air-to-sea''
tests by which aircraft from both nations communicated with the
other nation's ships, he said.
   Williams said he could not say how far the aircraft penetrated
the other's territory, nor could he say what language was used in
the transmissions.
   The accord is supposed to regulate the operation of military
forces near each other and avoid such near-misses as occurred
earlier this year in the Mediterranean.
   In September, a Soviet warship engaged in maneuvers with four
other Soviet ships near Crete opened fire on a U.S. Navy P-3
surveillance plane, barely missing the aircraft.
   The Navy protested the incident and the Soviets apologized, U.S.
officials said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa proposed
Tuesday that parliament grant special powers to the non-Communist
government to allow it to restructure the economy quickly.
   Walesa's apparently unsolicited proposal came as Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's Solidarity-dominated Cabinet was completing a
package of economic reform legislation for presentation to
Parliament Sunday.
   Instead of Parliament debating each new law, Walesa proposed in
effect that it give the government broad powers to implement
whatever kind of reform rules it sees as necessary.
   ``The government has not had a chance yet to think about the
(Walesa) statement,'' said deputy government spokesman Henryk
Wozniakowski. ``We are glad for the support which Lech Walesa
extends. ... However it is hard to say how useful this proposal
is.''
   Communist Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga, while not specifically
ruling out Walesa's proposal, said Parliament would be the
``appropriate forum'' for considering economic changes
   Walesa said he was moved to propose special powers in order to
speed up economic reforms.
   ``The situation in the country is getting worse. Time is running
out. The reserve of social trust is nearly expired,'' the union
leader said.
   Prolonged legislative debate would only slow the adoption of the
necessary laws, he said.
   ``That is why one should act quickly and with determination,''
Walesa said. ``I propose giving the government extraordinary
powers'' to address several key issues.
   The powers would apply to legal regulations on restructuring the
economy, changing the property system, breaking up the monopoly of
state-run and cooperative enterprises, and changing the tax and
accounting system, banking and local government structures, Walesa
said.
   He said he was ``fully aware how controversial this proposal is.
But I am forced to make it because of the ever worsening situation
in the country and the growing impatience of society.''
   He said the powers should be set by Parliament for a specified
period and for specific areas of activity. Its two houses _ the
Sejm and Senate _ could then work ``quietly'' on longer term laws,
while retaining the right to correct acts of the government.
   One effect of such powers would be to lessen the voice that the
Communist Party and its formerly allied parties in the parliament
in approving or rejecting specific aspects of economic policy.
   Mazowiecki's government is dominated by supporters of
Solidarity, who account for 12 seats in the 24-member Cabinet. The
Communists have four.
   In the Sejm, however, Solidarity has only 35 percent of the
seats with the Communists holding 37 percent.
   There were signs last week that some of the government's radical
economic programs that threaten the position of party members would
have trouble in the Sejm.
   For instance, some members of the Communist Party and its former
allies spoke against a government bill to break up nationwide
``unions of cooperatives'' dominated by party loyalists.
   The cooperative unions set prices and act as virtual monopolies
in many economic sectors such as the dairy industry and retail food
sales. The government wants to break up the monopolies so that the
dairies and food stores would be forced to compete against one
another.

<DATELINE>SEARCY, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been sentenced to four years in
prison for slapping his 4-year-old son twice for repeatedly
sniffing gasoline to get high.
   Richard Lewis Vardaman, 42, of Georgetown, was sentenced after
pleading guilty to one count of battery.
   Circuit Judge Cecil Tedder suspended two years of the sentence
on the condition that Vardaman obtain ``intensive psychological
treatment within 60 days'' of his release.
   Defense attorney Bill Mills said he was concerned how the stiff
penalty would affect other parents.
   ``If your child bruises easily and something else happens to
him, are you going to be willing to take him to a hospital for
treatment?'' he asked.
   Prosecutor Chris Raff said Monday that the sentence imposed Dec.
6 was appropriate.
   ``It was a serious case of child abuse,'' Raff said. ``It was
not normal discipline. I think the proof justified the sentence.''
   Mills said a representative of the state Human Services
Department's Division of Children and Family Services had testified
for Vardaman that it was an isolated incident.
   Vardaman, a riverboat pilot, was working on a river somewhere,
``waiting until they find room for him at the penitentiary. He's
resigned himself to the fact he's going to jail,'' the lawyer said.
   In late May, Vardaman caught his son and another boy sniffing
gasoline from a can at the Vardaman home.
   ``He popped both of the boys on their rear ends and told them
not to be doing that,'' Mills said.
   Vardaman found his son sniffing gas again the next morning, from
the gas tank of a lawn mower, Mills said. That afternoon, he said,
Vardaman found his son sniffing gas again.
   ``He slapped him once on each side of the face that time,''
Mills said.
   The boy was ``acting drunk,'' Mills said, and Vardaman and his
wife took him to White County Memorial Hospital at Searcy.
   The boy was acting normal by the time they reached the hospital,
and an emergency room nurse and a doctor noticed facial bruises and
called the police.
   Mills said photographs of the boy taken at the hospital were
shown to the judge. ``They looked pretty bad. The child has a ruddy
complexion and his face was puffy in the picture,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers and police guarded polling
stations and strategic points nationwide in preparation for
Thursday's election of a successor to military President Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   The campaign officially ended at midnight Monday, and polls
continued to show the opposition with a big lead. Pinochet's
government secretary-general, army Col. Cristian Labbe, promised
``a transparent and normal election.''
   The military is charged with ensuring order during elections,
and 35,000 armed forces members on Tuesday began guarding more than
1,000 polling places and scores of other strategic installations
thoughout the country, including power and communications plants
and public offices.
   The 30,000-man national police also reported stepped-up security
in anticipation of the vote, and Col. Luis Retamal, the force's
spokesman, urged citizens to behave in an orderly manner.
   Army Gen. Carlos Parera, commander of the Santiago garrison and
entrusted with the election security in the area, suspended all
permits to carry weapons until Friday.
   He also said the sale of alcoholic beverages will be banned on
election day, and all public events will be suspended. Theaters
will be closed, he said.
   Similar orders were issued by military commanders throughout the
country.
   Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup, was obliged to call the election after losing a
referendum in October 1988 on a military proposal that he remains
in power until 1997.
   Chile's 7.5 million voters will be asked to pick a new president
and 158 members of the two-chamber Congress. It is the first such
vote in nearly two decades.
   Favorite in the presidential race is Patricio Aylwin, who leads
a 17-party opposition coalition of leftist and centrist groups who
backs improvement in civil liberties and human rights.
   Aylwin, 71, holds a solid lead in all opinion polls over Hernan
Buchi, 40, the government standard-bearer and an ex-finance
minister considered the architect of the country's free-market
economy.
   Wealthy entrepreneur Francisco Javier Errazuriz, an independent,
is expected to finish third. He has promised free health care and
education to all Chileans.
   A last-minute national poll made public Tuesday by the Center
for Studies of Contemporary Reality, a private social research
organization related to the Roman Catholic Church, gave Aylwin 57
percent of the vote, 17.8 percent to Buchi and 15 percent to
Errazuriz.
   But Buchi has rejected the polls' predictions, and in his speech
at Monday's rally said, ``We will give them a big surprise.''
   His campaign headquarters, while admitting Aylwin has a
commanding lead, predicted Tuesday that the front-runner will not
receive more than 50 percent of the vote required to ensure
victory, thus making a runoff election necessary in January or
February.
   Jaime Ravinet, a close aide and spokesman for Aylwin, said ``our
victory is ensured,'' and called all his supporters to a ``big
celebration rally'' in Santiago on Friday afternoon.
   Hours before the remarkably peaceful campaign ended Monday
night, tens of thousands of people filled several blocks of a wide
Santiago avenue in the final Buchi rally. The rally ended with a
series of running skirmishes between police and both supporters and
opponents of Buchi.
   Police, who used water to scatter the demonstrators, said 34
demonstrators were injured, one of them seriously, and 64 were
detained in the incidents, which lasted through late Monday.

<TEXT>
   A judge today refused to dismiss
criminal charges against the skipper of the Exxon Valdez, rejecting
arguments that Joseph Hazelwood gained immunity from prosecution by
reporting the spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone said the nation's worst oil
spill would have been discovered within minutes even if Hazelwood
had not radioed in after the tanker hit a reef and began spilling
nearly 11 million gallons of crude.
   The judge thus ruled that all evidence gathered in the
investigation, except for Hazelwood's actual report, will be
admissible at his trial Jan. 22.
   Hazelwood is charged with three felonies and three misdemeanors
in the March 24 accident, including operating the tanker while
under the influence of alcohol.
   He could receive up to 10 years in prison and $100,000 in fines
if convicted of the felony offenses.
   Hazelwood's lawyers had argued the seaman was immune from
prosecution because state and federal laws protect people who
report oil spills.
   But after listening to two weeks of testimony, Johnstone
concluded that if Hazelwood had not reported the grounding and the
spill, it would have delayed the Coast Guard's discovery of the
spill by only 17 minutes.
   Johnstone's ruling appeared to be almost a total victory for
prosecutors, who argued that the intent of the spill-reporting
immunity provisions was not to protect spillers for incidents that
would have been discovered anyway.
   ``We are breaking new ground,'' in a sensitive area, Leonard
Linton, an assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the
case, told Johnstone on Monday.
   Richard Friedman, one of Hazelwood's lawyers, argued that
contract murderers, drug dealers and embezzlers are given immunity
because prosecutors believe making their information public will do
more good than putting them in jail.
   ``Congress conferred immunity,'' he said. ``It's not in this
court's province to tinker with the statute, to carve out an
exception.''
   Johnstone based his ruling on testimony by a radar operator at
the Coast Guard's traffic monitoring center in Valdez.
   The operator, Bruce Blandford, said that by 12:15 a.m. on March
24 he already was wondering about the location of the tanker. He
said if he hadn't heard from the 987-foot vessel by 12:30, he would
have tried to contact it by radio.
   Had that failed, he said, at 12:45 he would have tried to
determine the tanker's whereabouts by radar. Hazelwood reported the
accident at 12:28.
   Blandford said once he heard from Hazelwood, he adjusted his
radar and spotted the Exxon Valdez on Bligh Reef.
   The location alone would have been enough to require that the
port commander be notified, Blandford said, because he would have
to assume ``that he's in big, a lot of trouble, because I know that
there's no water there.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Parliament on
Tuesday rejected reformers' efforts to revoke the Communist Party's
monopoly on power and push the nation along the road to multiparty
democracy taken by Moscow's allies.
   But as the Congress of People's Deputies began its winter
session in the Kremlin, hundreds of parliamentarians supported
debate on altering the party's legal status, indicating the idea is
gaining popularity as reforms shake the Soviet Baltic and Eastern
Europe.
   The Congress, the 2,250-member Parliament that is theoretically
the nation's highest political body, gave Gorbachev the agenda he
wanted for its 10-day session. Gorbachev urged them to focus on the
economy.
   ``We need drastic reforms,'' the Soviet president. ``So far,
there are no improvements in this area.''
   ``The key question of the agenda is righting the economy, the
stages of economic reform and our approach to the next five-year
plan,'' Gorbachev said. He said the country needed ``as never
before,'' discipline and responsibility.
   In other East bloc developments Tuesday:
   _ Thousands of Bulgarians rallied in Sofia outside a Communist
Party Central Committee meeting to make sure the Communists keep
their promises of reforms _ including free elections and an end to
the party's monopoly on power. An official said the party lacks
enough talented people to promote its doctrine and manage the
economy.
   _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in Potsdam with East
German Premier Hans Modrow and told him of U.S. support for the
reforms taking place there. East Germany's Communist Party
newspaper conceded that a botched brand of socialism has degraded
living conditions, but said those times are past and a new
``democratic socialism'' is in the making.
   _ Czechoslovakia's ousted Communist hard-liners lost their last
positions of power as Parliament formally accepted their
resignations. The battle for president heated up between playwright
Vaclav Havel and Alexander Dubcek, 67, the leader of the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Poland's government should
be granted special economic powers allowing it to restructure the
economy without the approval of Parliament.
   The Soviet deputies met in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses
before a giant statue of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
Gorbachev pressed the deputies toward a more organized approach to
their session than the nationally televised free-for-all in May and
June.
   Only the first few hours were televised live, with the rest
shown on tape Tuesday evening. However, deputies voted later not to
allow Soviet TV to air any debates on ethnic issues after speakers
touched on the explosive conflict between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis that has led to an estimated 200 deaths and hundreds
of thousands of refugees in the last two years.
   Despite Gorbachev's plea for urgent action on the economy, a
long debate over procedural matters threw the Congress behind
schedule, delaying Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's economic report.
That report apparently will be based on a long-term plan developed
by his deputy, Leonid Abalkin, that includes making the ruble
convertible, selling off unprofitable state enterprises and
developing a stock market.
   In the first major test only 2{ hours after the session began,
the Congress rejected a bid by Baltic deputies and members of the
reformist Inter-Regional Deputies Group to debate Article 6 of the
Soviet Constitution that proclaims the Communist Party ``the
leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its
political system.''
   The vote was 1,139 to 839. Fifty-six deputies abstained. It came
a day after human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov's call for a
general strike to press for elimination of Article 6 fizzled.
   Poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko told the deputies: ``Authority must not
be only written into one paragraph, but proven every day.'' He
called the vote total a ``noble defeat'' because 87 percent of the
deputies are Communist Party members.
   Vilen Tolpezhnikov, a deputy from Latvia, argued that the party
is used to usurping power. Tolpezhnikov, a member of a committee
investigating the military assault on demonstrators in Tbilisi,
Georgia, in April, said the decision to use force was made at a
meeting in the party Central Committee. ``There were no special
decrees, nobody was taking notes in the course of the conference,''
he said.
   But he alleged that as a result of the conference, Defense
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov gave the order to use force.
Shovel-wielding soldiers killed 19 civilians.
   Lithuania last week became the first of the 15 Soviet republics
to abolish the Communist Party's leading role, rewriting its
Constitution to allow a multiparty system.
   Gorbachev's reforms have pushed the Soviet Union's Eastern
European allies toward radical changes that have ended the
communist monopoly on power. Hungary, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia have removed such language from their constitutions,
and Poland has a non-communist goverment. The Bulgarian leadership
has proposed a multiparty system.
   Soviet Communist Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev said
Saturday that the party would not maintain its monopoly on power
``at any cost.'' But Gorbachev criticized Sakharov's strike call as
an effort ``at belittling the party, or of undermining its prestige
among the working people.''
   He called for a sober debate of Article 6. ``We cannot start
political speculation. And that's it,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also engaged in an angry exchange with Sakharov, who
proposed the Congress debate not only the party's monopoly on
political power but ``all the articles hindering the passing of
laws on land, property and other bills promoting perestroika.''
   The law on land would allow farmers to pass down to their
children their rights on state-owned land. The law on property
would widen ownership rights, but stops short of allowing private
property. Both are considered major pieces of reform legislation
that will break the top-down control of the economy. They were
debated by the Supreme Soviet _ the standing legislature that is
elected by the Congress _ at its fall session and published for
public debate.
   Gorbachev told Sakharov, ``I am under the impression that
neither you nor we will know how to realize your suggestion. Who is
to define what articles to exclude?''
   Sakharov then turned to Gorbachev and handed him a stack of
telegrams in support of his position.
   ``You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams,''
Gorbachev retorted.
   When he began to speak about Article 6, Gorbachev cut him short
and with a curt, ``Thank you.''
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev brought Sakharov's proposal up for a
vote. It was defeated 1,415 to 477. A separate proposal to
specifically debate the laws on land and property was defeated
1,387 to 537.

   Pressured by a steady drain of disillusioned
workers and increasing calls for reunification, East Germany's
Communist Party conceded Tuesday that a flawed brand of socialism
had hurt living standards.
   In the past month, the Communists have given up their legal
monopoly on power and that has raised questions about their mandate
to govern until national parliamentary elections are held May 6.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker met in Potsdam with Communist
Premier Hans Modrow in a show of support for the nation's reforms.
   One pro-reform group, Demokratischer Aufbruch, said Modrow and
his Cabinet should step down. It does not appear that position
enjoys broad support, however, since Modrow retains a fairly high
standing among East Germans.
   Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi said his party would not
allow a ``foreign policy vacuum'' to develop despite the upheavals
of the past two months.
   ``What we need in this country through May 6 is stability,''
Gysi said when informed of the reform group's demand.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher traveled to
East Berlin to meet with the group's leader Rainer Eppelmann. No
details of the talks were disclosed.
   The party's official daily, Neues Deutschland, blamed socialism
for poor living conditions in the most blunt admission yet of the
party's culpability in the nation's political and economic crisis.
   ``The governmental and administrative socialism has definitely
failed as a social system in our country,'' the newspaper said.
   But, it added, a new ``democratic socialism'' was in the making.
   The party appeared torn over the question of closer ties with
West Germany, and the newspaper called for ``a qualified
partnership'' acceptable to European neighbors.
   Allies of East Germany and West Germany have expressed
reservations about a confederation between the nations or eventual
reunification, as proposed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   But the economic crisis that has burdened East Germany's more
than 16 million citizens with problems from pollution to scarce
consumer goods continues to drive away the nation's best hope for
an improved future _ its young workers.
   A prominent social scientist told the official ADN news agency
that 317,500 East Germans have fled to the West so far this year,
and that more than 75 percent of them were under age 40.
   Wulfram Speigner of the Institute for Sociology and Social
Policy said the exodus has caused severe labor shortages in
Dresden, Karl-Marx-Stadt and Leipzig.
   The exodus peaked this fall and led in part to the ouster of
longtime party leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18. Mass
demonstrations for reformed continued, however, and the leadership
on Nov. 9 opened its borders, including the Berlin Wall, to allow
citizens to travel freely.
   Baker visited the wall Tuesday and then traveled from West
Berlin to Potsdam to meet with Modrow. It was the first time a U.S.
secretary of state visited East Germany since diplomatic relations
were established in 1974.
   ``I felt that it was important that we have an opportunity to
let the premier and the people of East Germany know of our support
for the reforms which are taking place in this country,'' Baker
said later.
   Modrow said the visit was seen as an endorsement of reform. ``We
started a dialogue with each other today,'' he said.
   Also Tuesday, the two German states agreed to a joint project to
install 188 new international telephone lines in East Germany
within a week.
   Communications ministers Klaus Wolf of East Germany and
Christian Schwarz-Schilling of West Germany did not say how much
the project will cost.
   Wolf said that 98 percent of the existing telephones in East
Germany are worn out, and that his ministry has applications for
1.2 million new installations in private homes.
   Schwarz-Schilling said the new lines will allow 30,000 more
calls a day, but were only a ``drop on a hot stone.''
   Officials said it would cost about $6.7 billion to bring East
Germany's phone network up to Western standards.
   Despite disagreements over the desired level of cooperation
between the countries, other projects are under negotiation.
   West German officials have offered wide-ranging aid to help East
Germany deal with its economic troubles in return for democratic
reforms, including free elections.
   East German officials have characterized those terms as a
sellout and have tried to work toward reform within a socialist
structure.
   But weekly demonstrations in the city of Leipzig have
illustrated growing support for a confederation or reunification
with capitalist West Germany.

<HEAD>Admiral Admits Error in Report on Battleship Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief Navy officer investigating the USS
Iowa explosion acknowledged Tuesday that his report contained a key
factual error, but said he stood by its conclusion.
   Among the initial ``findings of fact'' in Rear Adm. Richard L.
Milligan's report was an assertion that the blast was most likely
triggered by a timing device. Subsequent laboratory tests have led
the Navy to believe that a chemical device was used.
   Milligan, appearing before a House Armed Services subcommittee,
was asked why he had not amended his report to reflect that key
change.
   ``I'm not trying to smother the world with paperwork,'' he
replied. Milligan said that if the subcommittee wished to have the
report formally changed, he would discuss the matter with his
superiors.
   He also conceded that, in hindsight, he would have done ``some
things differently,'' such as moving more quickly to protect
evidence in the damaged No. 2 gun turret of the World War II-era
battleship.
   During a laborious defense of his probe before the subcommittee,
however, Milligan stuck to his conclusion that Gunner's Mate 2nd
Class Clayton Hartwig ``most probably'' was responsible.
   Hartwig and 46 Iowa crewmates perished in the April 19 incident,
the worst of its kind in Navy annals.
   Milligan and Capt. Joseph D. Miceli of the Naval Sea System
Command told the committee they had checked all possible options
before concluding that the explosion was most likely the result of
an intentional act by an apparently suicidal Hartwig.
   Intense questioning followed Rep. Nicholas Mavroules' opening
statement that his subcommittee had assembled ``a substantially
different picture from the one painted by the Navy.''
   Milligan completed his initial report July 15, less than three
months after the explosion. The report, endorsed by the chief of
naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, and two other reviewing
officers, concluded that the blast apparently had been caused by a
``detonator'' Hartwig placed between gunpowder bags in the turret's
center 16-inch gun.
   Milligan insisted that in holding the 24-year-old Hartwig
responsible, he had built a case that would ``stand up in a court
of law.'' But the rear admiral reiterated previous statements that
he could not blame Hartwig beyond a shadow of a doubt because
witnesses died in the explosion.
   Asked if he had been pushed by the Navy to quickly release a
report, Milligan replied, ``Absolutely not, sir. If anything, I was
told to take whatever time necessary. ...
   ``I was given no guidance whatsoever as to what the ultimate
findings of my investigation were.''
   Several committee members, nonetheless, faulted Milligan's
investigation, with some questioning why such an onerous task was
placed on a person who was not a lawyer and who had not undertaken
such a mission before.
   Milligan said he thought he had been chosen by superiors because
of his 30 years' experience in the Navy and his command of the USS
New Jersey, a battleship virtually identical to the Iowa.
   Mavroules, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, said that while
he was troubled by conflicts in statements made by individuals
interviewed by the Navy investigators and by his panel, ``I cannot
explain at this point in time why the differences exist.''
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the Armed Services Committee
chairman, told Milligan he thought it was wrong for Navy
investigators to rule out a technical reason for the explosion.
   ``Just a little bit of humility is required,'' Aspin told
Milligan. ``There may yet be a technical explanation out there that
we haven't thought of yet.''
   Under heavy questioning, Milligan acknowledged that the
``findings of fact'' in his report were flawed because the report
ascribed the blast to the placement of a timing device between two
bags of propellant.
   He also said that when he arrived on the Iowa the day after the
explosion, he sought immediately to clean up the damaged turret,
authorizing Capt. Fred Moosally to assign sailors to remove highly
flammable hydraulic oil flooding the blast site.
   ``The problem was the danger that existed in the unburnt
propellant,'' he told Mavroules. ``There is always the possibility
that evidence would be lost, but that was a decision I had to make
to protect the ship.''
   Mavroules, Aspin and others said they thought Milligan had erred
in failing to immediately call in the Naval Investigative Service
to protect valuable evidence.
   Milligan said he initially thought he was investigating an
accident. He said the thought of sabotage did not occur to him
until it was learned that Hartwig had named shipmate Kendall Truitt
as a beneficiary on a $100,000 life insurance policy.
   Milligan stressed that the most valuable piece of evidence _ the
projectile jammed into the gun's bore _ was protected. In fact, he
said, it took a month to dislodge it from the gun's bore.
   Truitt, who has said he does not believe Hartwig blew up the
ship, is scheduled to testify Wednesday. Moosally had told the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Monday that he could not share
the Navy's conclusion that Hartwig likely caused the explosion
while committing suicide, although the captain said he could not
disprove that theory.

<HEAD>Britain Defends Forced Repatriation Amid International Outcry</HEAD>

   Britain on Tuesday defended its first forced
repatriation of 51 Vietnamese from Hong Kong and challenged
countries that protested to open their doors instead.
   The United States urged Britain to halt mandatory repatriation.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was ``unacceptable
until conditions improve in Vietnam.''
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there would be no more
forced repatriations until a House of Commons debate on Dec. 19,
although he said Britain still plans to deport 44,000 Vietnamese
from its colony.
   ``Unless it is clear to people in Vietnam that those who do not
qualify as refugees will be returned to Vietnam, Hong Kong faces
the prospect of tens of thousands more arrivals in 1990. This is
simply not an acceptable prospect,'' he said.
   The United States, Canada and the international human rights
organization Amnesty International had appealed to Britain to halt
the repatriation.
   But Hong Kong security forces went ahead, rousting 51 Vietnamese
men, women and children from their beds before dawn Tuesday and
putting them on a chartered jet to Hanoi. Vietnam accepted them but
criticized the action.
   ``This conjures up every picture I have in my mind of World War
II concentration camps,'' said Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., in
Washington. ``How can the British forget history's most agonizing
lesson and repeat so many of its horrors?''
   Hong Kong houses about 57,000 Vietnamese boat people, more than
90 percent from North Vietnam, in squalid camps rife with violence
and malnutrition. There were fears that the first forced
repatriations might touch off protests but a Hong Kong government
spokesman said Tuesday night that the camps were quiet.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was more humane to
repatriate Vietnamese who cannot prove they face political
persecution than to keep them indefinitely in overcrowded camps.
   ``Those countries who are protesting at their return would do
far better if they offered to take some of them,'' she told the
House of Commons, amid taunts and jeers from the opposition.
   ``Those countries which have shown anger about it have not even
agreed to take any of the 13,000 genuine refugees (in Hong Kong)
for whom we are still seeking a home,'' she said. British
government sources noted that the United States was reluctant to
take refugees from North Vietnam.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United
States believed Britain should ``grant asylum to all those persons
from Vietnam who seek it.''
   ``While we may have differences with the British on this action,
we both agree that conditions inside Vietnam are the root cause of
the problem,'' Boucher added. ``We hope we can work together to
deal with this.''
   British opposition leader Neil Kinnock accused Mrs. Thatcher of
acting ``tyranically'' and demanded: ``What excuse have you got for
giving instructions that in the middle of the night, armed riot
police raid children, women and men, shove them into caged lorries
(trucks) and forcibly deport them to the country from which they
fled?''
   Mrs. Thatcher denied the police were armed. She said the
international conference on Indochinese refugees in June agreed to
resettle genuine refugees and return those not at risk from
political persecution to Vietnam.
   Britain said the expelled Vietnamese were ``economic migrants.''
Hurd stressed that the criteria for qualifying as a refugee was
decided by Britain in agreement with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, and that every Vietnamese had a right of
appeal.
   The U.N. group said Tuesday it regards the forced repatriation
of the 51 Vietnamese as premature, but said it was satisfied that
none of them were genuine refugees.
   The group has refused to take part in any mandatory return. It
is coordinating a voluntary repatriation plan, strongly backed by
the United States, under which 637 Vietnamese have returned since
March. More than 1,000 are registered to go back.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted a Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
statement in Hanoi as saying Vietnam in principle has accepted
voluntary returnees but ``will refuse flatly forced repatriation.''
   Hong Kong's action this time ``violates humanitarianism,'' the
Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying, but that the 51 Vietnamese
would be accepted.
   Hurd said voluntary repatriation ``will not match the scale of
the problem,'' and said Britain hoped to get Vietnam's agreement to
accept returnees, voluntary and involuntary, at a faster rate.
   Vietnam had told Britain that those repatriated would not be
punished for leaving, he said. Government sources said there had
been no problems with those who previously returned home
voluntarily.
   The British Embassy in Hanoi will monitor conditions of those
forcibly repatriated, Hurd said. Britain also wants the U.N. group
to participate in the monitoring, although it has so far refused,
government sources said.
   Hurd said two former ministers, Conservative Timothy Raison
Laborite Lord Ennals, will visit Vietnam next month to report on
the condition of the 51 boat people sent back Tuesday.

   Drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero was
sentenced Tuesday to 40 years imprisonment for masterminding the
1985 murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena, the government said.
   The sentence was handed down by Judge Tomas Hernandez Franco of
the 4th Criminal Court in Guadalajara, said Rene Hernandez, a
spokesman for the attorney general's office. Attorney General
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo scheduled a news conference here to
provide details.
   The killing of Camarena, a U.S. agent based in Mexico, and the
subsequent investigation strained relations between Mexico and the
United States. U.S. officials said the Mexicans allowed Caro
Quintero to escape to Costa Rica, where he was finally hunted down.
   At one point, U.S. Customs virtually blocked the border by
conducting full searches of all Mexicans trying to enter the United
States in an effort to put pressure on the Mexican government.
   The year-old administration of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has made vigorous efforts to change Mexico's image as a
haven for drug traffickers and corruption, jailing top druglords
and busting many corrupt officials.
   Caro Quintero, who pioneered links with Colombia's cocaine
cartels to smuggle drugs into the United States via Mexico, is
serving a 34-year term in another case for illegal possession and
sale of drugs.
   Camarena was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara, capital of
Jalisco state and a major drug-trafficking center about 350 miles
west of Mexico City. His Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, was
also abducted.
   Their bullet-riddled bodies, showing signs of torture, were
found March 5 on a ranch about 60 miles from Guadalajara. The
bodies, wrapped in plastic bags, had been buried in shallow graves
on the property, about 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara.

   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem said
Tuesday that tough Israeli tactics against the Palestinian uprising
could backfire and create increasing insecurity for the Jewish
state.
   Archbishop Michel Sabbah, the first Arab to head the Catholic
church in Jerusalem, said in an interview that he has expressed
this view in meetings with the Ministry of Religious Affairs, his
channel to the Israeli government.
   ``We tell them they are doing wrong,'' Sabbah said. ``Through
all this violence ... they are not achieving any gain for the
Israelis themselves. Instead they are doing the opposite, making
martyrs among the Palestinians. That just helps build strength
among the Palestinian people.''
   Sabbah argued the secure borders desired by Israel cannot be
achieved by continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The territories were captured by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East War and have been torn for the last two years
by a Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule that has taken more
than 800 lives.
   Asked if he favors an independent Palestinian state, he said
that ``this is a political, a technical issue'' to be left for
negotiations.
   ``The problem is to live free, without being under submission to
anyone else,'' he said. ``Leaders can decide if this requires a
state, a confederation, a federation.''
   Sabbah, 56, was appointed patriarch by the Vatican less than a
month after the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987 and is
responsible for the 65,000 Roman Catholics who live in Jordan,
Cyprus, Israel and the West Bank.
   He was born in Nazareth, now part of Israel, and educated at a
seminary in the West Bank village of Beit Jala and St. Joseph's
University in Lebanon. He earned a doctorate in Arabic linguistics
at the Sorbonne in Paris.

   Police fired on striking black
transport workers Tuesday, injuring 50, officials said, and a bomb
exploded on a railway line near Cape Town, forcing the cancellation
of rush-hour trains.
   The state-run South African Transport Services dismissed 1,073
strikers, raising the total fired during a six-week walkout to
12,617.
   Witnesses and hospital personnel said police used rubber
bullets, buckshot and birdshot on about 500 strikers in Cape Town
as they marched on the main railway building.
   Fifty men were hospitalized and at least eight required surgery,
according to officials at Groote Schuur Hospital and the Gatesville
Medical Center.
   The workers had marched the same route almost daily during the
strike without serious incident. They said they did not hear any
warnings from police before the shooting began.
   The explosion before dawn outside Cape Town damaged a rail line
and forced the cancellation of 30 morning rush-hour trains, the
transportation company said. Thousands of commuters were affected,
the company added.
   Police investigated the possibility that two bombings Monday
night in Johannesburg were linked to the strike. One blast
shattered windows in an area near the business office of the
transport company and the other killed two Indian men at
Johannesburg's main railroad station.
   Police on Tuesday said they found limpet mines, AK-47 rifles,
hand grenades and pistols at the home of one of the slain men,
Yusuf Akhalwaya, 23.
   The other man, Prakash Napier, 24, was believed to be carrying a
limpet mine and working with Akhalwaya when it detonated
unexpectedly, police said.
   Prior to the bombings, five people had been killed in
strike-related violence. There have been many arson and sabotage
attacks that the company has blamed on strikers.
   In Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg, a grenade thrown
from a moving trains injured two men waiting at a station Tuesday,
police said.
   About 20,000 workers walked out Nov. 2, demanding the minimum
monthly wage be increased from $225 to $560. The strikers also are
demanding formal recognition of their union, the South African
Railway and Harbor Workers Union.
   Management has refused to enter wage talks, saying a pay hike
was negotiated earlier this year. The company has been firing
workers steadily and says all will be dismissed unless they return
to work.
   Whites employed by the 170,000-worker company make significantly
more money for the most part and dominate administrative and
supervisory posts.
   Company officials say damage to property during the strike
exceeds $8 million. But they say their rail and harbor operations
have not been seriously affected by the walkout, which is illegal
under legislation that bars strikes in essential services.

<HEAD>U.S. Promises More Than 100,000 Tons of Food for Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday promised more
than 100,000 metric tons of new food aid to Ethiopia to help soften
the blow of a drought that threatens to be as bad as the 1984
disaster in which an estimated 1 million people died.
   And Mark L. Edelman, acting director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, welcomed reports that Ethiopia's
hard-line Marxist government will allow a corridor for food aid to
flow to people in the embattled northern provinces of Eritrea and
Tigray.
   ``If it is (true), I am absolutely delighted,'' said Edelman.
``I congratulate President Mengistu for doing it.''
   A severe drought in the two provinces, coupled with what Edelman
called the government's discredited agricultural policies and the
continuing civil war, have placed 5 million people at risk of
starvation, he said.
   ``We are trying to save the people of Ethiopia from their own
government,'' Edelman added.
   ``These numbers suggest we are dealing with a situation at least
as bad as in 1987 and possibly as bad as 1984,'' when a massive but
belated international relief effort failed to head off the deaths
of an estimated 1 million Ethiopians, he said.
   This time, Edelman contended, the U.S. relief agency is ``ahead
of the curve.'' Some 53,800 metric tons of food is arriving from
the United States this month; the additional 111,400 tons approved
Tuesday will put the value of U.S. food aid committed since Oct. 1
at $70 million.
   The aid is to help meet a total need of up to 750,000 metric
tons of food to offset the drought's effects. The Ethiopian
government and the United Nations have put out a worldwide appeal
for help.
   Any relief effort is complicated by the war raging across
northern Ethiopia, where two rebel groups control much of the
territory and where a large expanse extending into two other
provinces, Wello and Gonder, also is contested. Relief officials
are seeking to get all parties in the conflict to establish
corridors where relief vehicles can safely pass battle lines so
that food shipments can reach the drought-stricken area.
   Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Tuesday the Addis Ababa
government has agreed to the establishment of corridors, and said
he had asked the rebel groups to do the same.
   The primary corridor sought is a road extending sought from the
Red Sea port of Massawa, which is controlled by the Mengistu
government, into Tigray. A secondary corridor would be established
from the Red Sea port of Aseb southwestward through Wello.
   Edelman said the announcement was being made because it has
recently become apparent that ``the need is going to be much
greater than we thought.''
   ``We do not believe it will be possible to avert starvation in
northern Ethiopia or to prevent large movements of people out of
drought-stricken areas unless such a plan can be implemented,'' he
said.
   Such migrations in the 1984-85 famine led to vast, overcrowded
and unsanitary camps where as many people died from disease as from
hunger.
   ``Now is the time for the government of Ethiopia and the world
community to join together in an urgent, concerted effort to
prevent the human tragedy of another famine in Ethiopia,'' he said.

   Vasil Bilak, the hard-line
Communist viewed by many here as the most culpable for the 1968
invasion, denied Tuesday that he invited in Soviet-led troops to
crush the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Bilak was charged Monday on two unspecified counts that the
state news agency CTK said were connected with the events of 1968.
   ``According to some opinions, his deeds can be considered
treason,'' CTK said, but added that Bilak would not face trial
because of a 20-year statute of limitation on the alleged crimes.
   Bilak, 72, is a deputy in the national Parliament. During a
break in a parliamentary session, he blamed the Soviet Union for
the invasion, which involved troops of the Red Army and four other
Warsaw Pact nations.
   ``I did not invite them. Do you think I'm so strong that I can
invite five armies and they will come?'' he said.
   Bilak added: ``If I invite you to dinner and you say `No,' then
you don't come. The responsibility is on the one who comes, not the
one who invites. They didn't have to come.''
   He also said the historic context of the invasion had been
forgotten.
   ``It was the peak of the Cold War,'' Bilak said. ``It was
horrible.''
   In similar comments to CTK, Bilak said the invading countries
``faced the threat of World War III.''
   Until the recent reforms, Czechoslovakia maintained _ in
accordance with Soviet views at the time _ that the invasion was
necessary to stop a counterrevolution.
   It has since been declared a mistake and a commission of
historians will investigate it.
   Bilak told CTK that in 1968 it ``was said in Moscow they cannot
tolerate liquidation of something for which 20 million people
died,'' a reference to the Soviets who died defending their country
in World War II.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda in Bilak's native Slovakia said
Tuesday that he brought shame on his party by acquiring a luxurious
villa for a small price after the state invested ten times the sum
to renovate it.
   The villa stands in the exclusive Slavin district of Bratislava,
near the home of Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   Bilak was Slovak Communist Party chief under Dubcek, who was
national party head at the time.
   Pravda also noted that Bilak's villa once belonged to Slovak
allies of the Nazis.
   Such gibes once were reserved for opposition leader Vaclav
Havel. His family built a Prague ballroom complex containing an
office used by the Nazis, a fact frequently mentioned in past media
attacks on Havel.
   Asked about the current reforms that have overturned the
hard-line policies he propagated as party ideology chief until
October 1988, Bilak said the move toward democracy was good and bad.
   ``When the people ask for more democracy, more freedom, that's
OK. But when they persecute one another, it subverts the very thing
that is being asked for,'' he said.

   A Bolivian colonel dubbed his nation's ``minister
of cocaine'' in the early 1980s was ordered held without bond
Tuesday on drug-trafficking charges that could send him to prison
for 30 years.
   Luis Arce Gomez was a fugitive for six years until Sunday, when
Bolivian authorities raided his ranch and put him on a Drug
Enforcement Administration plane bound for the United States.
   Human rights groups have accused Arce Gomez of running death
squads that hunted down, tortured and killed enemies of the
military government with the help of fugitive Nazi Klaus Barbie.
   ``Bringing him to trial is a significant strike against the
danger posed to the United States by those who deal in narcotics,''
said Diane Cossin, executive assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen. ``We hope to convict him of these charges and have him
spend time in prison.''
   Arce Gomez, wearing a T-shirt, slacks and sandals, responded
with ``I understand'' after he was read a summary of charges at a
hearing before U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff.
   He was represented by Jose Quinon, one of Carlos Lehder Rivas'
attorneys during his trial in Jacksonville last year.
   Lehder Rivas, who is Colombian, was convicted of masterminding a
massive cocaine conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison.
   Arce Gomez, his hands clasped behind his back, spoke up at the
end of his hearing to request that the records from a 1983
extradition hearing in Argentina be preserved for his defense.
   ``He emerged victorious out of that hearing and he wants to make
sure that any proof presented there is preserved,'' his attorney
said.
   Turnoff ordered an arraignment and formal bond hearing for Dec.
26 in Fort Lauderdale, where previous trials on the indictment have
been held.
   The 1983 Miami indictment against Arce Gomez and his top aides
accuses them of setting up a protection racket for drug traffickers
in Bolivia, charging them huge sums to continue business _ as much
as $75,000 every two weeks to look the other way, according to some
reports.
   One count of the indictment says he ordered the release of
confiscated cocaine stored in bank vaults after the payment to his
aides of $1.5 million.
   On the charges of conspiracy to import cocaine to the United
States and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,
Arce Gomez faces 15 years and a $25,000 fine on each count. He was
being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center
southwest of Miami.
   Arce Gomez took over the interior ministry after a July 1980
military coup against Bolivia's civilian government, and was
considered the regime's strongman. U.S. and Latin American
officials at the time called the takeover a ``cocaine coup''
financed by traffickers, and Arce Gomez became widely known as
``minister of cocaine.''
   He had a fleet of 11 airplanes, a mansion in the Bolivian drug
production center of Santa Cruz, a hacienda with a private lighted
airstrip and another mansion in La Paz.
   In December 1980, he came to the United States to try to improve
relations strained by rampant human rights abuses and cocaine
trafficking in Bolivia. The State Department made it clear that he
was not welcome and denied his request to lay a wreath at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier.
   On March 1, 1980, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' program detailed Arce
Gomez's drug connections, and included accusations against him by
then-DEA chief Peter Bennsinger and U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.
   Two days later DeConcini was told by the FBI that Arce Gomez had
put a contract out on his life, said the senator's aide, Amy
Silverman. DeConcini was guarded full-time for the next three
months, she said Tuesday.
   Under growing pressure from the United States and from within
the Bolivian military, Arce Gomez was forced out of office at the
end of March 1981. When civilian rule returned to Bolivia in 1982,
he fled the country for Argentina to avoid arrest.
   Argentina's military government arrested him following the 1983
indictment in Miami, but released him on a technicality only days
before civilian President Raul Alfonsin took over that nation's
reins in December 1983.
   Bolivia, meanwhile, stripped him of his citizenship when he
failed to show up at his trial on human rights abuses. Arce Gomez
had been a fugitive until his arrest Sunday.
   Seventeen other people were indicted. Five, including his former
top aide Rene Benitez, have pleaded guilty or been convicted.
Eleven others are fugitives, and one, Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, has
pleaded innocent in the case after being extradited from Colombia
in October.

   A rookie police officer was reprimanded for
covering his badge with black tape as a show of support for a
colleague convicted of manslaughter. The symbol usually is reserved
for slain officers.
   ``I felt it was a dishonor to those police officers who had lost
their lives in the line of duty,'' said Police Chief Perry
Anderson. ``To see an officer wearing that for any other reason _
for any other expression _ is unforgiveable.''
   Alejandro Mendez was cited Friday for ``unbecoming conduct'' in
support of William Lozano, convicted last week in the deaths of two
black men.
   The shooting deaths provoked three days of rioting that left one
man dead and more than $1 million damage. Lozano is scheduled to be
sentenced Jan. 24.
   Other officers say Mendez is among many in the police department
who have rallied to Lozano's defense.
   Some officers have signed a petition urging Dade Circuit Judge
Joseph Farina to allow Lozano to remain free on bond pending
appeals.
   ``The police department has to be impartial,'' said Anderson.
``To put something on that's not authorized, to make an officer
stand out to show that he favors or disfavors any kind of action,
would go against the grain of professionalism.''
   Mendez, 22, apologized to the chief.
   ``I didn't mean anything disrespectful,'' he said.
   But the Hispanic Officers Association intends to fight the
reprimand.
   ``I think they're taking away the kid's constitutional right to
express his feelings,'' said Martin Garcia, president of the
368-member association of Miami officers.

<HEAD>Bill Proposes Jailing Those Responsible for Environmental Disasters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two congressmen introduced legislation Tuesday
that would jail those responsible for environmental disasters that
cause death, injury or severe damage.
   ``Those who might wreak havoc on our environment should be
scared,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The bill sponsored by Schumer and Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.,
would establish punishments ranging from 15 years in jail and a
$250,000 fine for a first offense to 30 years in jail and a $2
million fine for subsequent offenses.
   The bill also would allow the court to sentence an organization
or company convicted of an environmental offense to probation and
require an independent environmental audit. The audit would
identify pollutants and recommend prevention measures the court
could require the defendant to implement.
   The National Resources Defense Council, in testimony before
Schumer's Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, said the
legislation is desperately needed and should be made even stronger.
   The American Petroleum Institute, however, called the
legislation flawed and uncessary.
   ``While from time to time it is suggested that enforcement of
one statute or another could be more vigorous, we are not aware of
any suggestions that the current criminal provisions, on the whole
are inadequate to deter irresponsible behavior that endangers the
environment,'' said API Vice President G. William Frick.
   George Van Cleve, deputy assistant attorney general in the
Justice Department, said the Bush administration favors stiffening
punishments for violations of anti-pollution laws.
   However, he said the administration has ``some problems of a
general character'' with the bill, suggesting intergrating concepts
offered by the bill into existing laws.

<HEAD>Israeli Patrol Wounds 12 Palestinians in Gaza</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers on a foot patrol shot and wounded 12
Palestinian stone-throwers Tuesday in the Rafah refugee camp in the
occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   In the occupied West Bank, protests flared when the army lifted
a 12-day curfew on Nablus and its surrounding refugee camps and
troops shot and wounded a 25-year-old Palestinian, Arab reporters
said.
   An army spokesman said six Palestinians were reported wounded in
Gaza and that it was investigating the incident in Nablus.
   The army clamped a curfew on Nablus following fierce clashes
after troops killed four Palestinian activists on Dec. 1.
   The army said the four were leaders of the Black Panthers, a
Palestinian gang accused of killing 16 Arabs suspected of
cooperating with Israeli authorities.
   On Tuesday, nearly 120 Palestinians paraded through the casbah,
a marketplace where the group operated, waving the outlawed
Palestine Liberation Organization flag and chanting ``Long live the
Black Panthers!''
   In the old city of Nablus, masked men marched with loudspeakers
shouting warnings to Palestinians who cooperate with Israel, Arab
reporters said.
   The reporters said a patrol fired on protesters in the Rafah
camp, home to 50,000 Palestinians, and wounded 12, including a
10-year-old.
   During the 2-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule,
Israeli troops and civilians have killed 631 Palestinians; 43
Israelis have died, and Palestinians have killed 155 of their
fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating.
   On the political front, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said
Tuesday he was ``very disappointed'' with Egypt's conditional
acceptance of U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal
for restarting the Mideast peace process.
   ``It was a message from the PLO and not an independent Egyptian
position,'' Arens told reporters in Tel Aviv.
   Arens says peace talks will fail if Israel is found indirectly
negotiating with the PLO through Egypt. Israel views the PLO as a
terrorist organization.
   Arens is to visit Washington in January to meet with Baker and
Foreign Minister Esmet Abdel Meguid of Egypt to discuss the
composition of a Palestinian delegation to negotiations with Israel.

   The Bush administration Tuesday condemned
Britain's decision to send Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong back to
their homeland and appealed for the forced return flights to cease
on humanitarian grounds.
   More Vietnamese might be allowed into the United States if Hong
Kong persists in deporting Vietnamese boat people, officials said.
   ``The U.S. position is that involuntary repatriation is
unacceptable until conditions improve in Vietnam,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We continue to support the voluntary repatriation of asylum
seekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of action adopted by
the Red Cross,'' he added.
   In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there would be no
more flights until the House of Commons debates the issue on Dec.
19.
   Fifty-two Vietnamese migrants were roused from their beds by
security forces before dawn and put on a chartered jet to Hanoi in
Hong Kong's first forced repatriation of boat people.
   The British colony currently houses about 57,000 Vietnamese in
squalid camps. Britain contends they are not true refugees because
they did not flee persecution but simply sought a better life
economically.
   Fitzwater, noting that the United States had accepted 50,000
Vietnamese in the last year, cited humanitarian arguments against
forcing boat people to return against their will.
   ``We recognize the large number of Vietnamese asylum-seekers in
Hong Kong has strained their resources. However, we believe that
these pressures are best alleviated through the type of concerted
international action called for by the International Red Cross,''
he said.
   He said U.S. position is that ``the country of first asylum has
responsibility,'' in this case the British colony.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican
Research Committee, called the repatriation ``totally outrageous''
and urged Hong Kong and Britain to reconsider or ``face the scorn
of the world community.''
   ``All free men should be disgusted by Hong Kong's actions,''
Hunter said. ``The boat people braved stormy seas, leaky boats and
pirates to escape Communist Vietnam. Now Hong Kong, one of the
miracles of democracy and free enterprise, is dragging the boat
people kicking and screaming back to Vietnam.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said ``the
United States deeply regrets the forcible repatriation of
Vietnamese asylum seekers from Hong Kong to Vietnam.
   ``We believe that the British government should not proceed
further with mandatory repatriation from Hong Kong. We believe that
British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those
persons from Vietnam who seek it,'' Boucher said.
   He cited a June agreement to that effect reached in Geneva by
the United States, the British, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian
nations.
   ``While we may have differences with the British on this action,
we both agree that conditions inside Vietnam are the root cause of
the problem. We hope we can work together to deal with this,'' he
said.
   He added that the United States continues to press Vietnam for a
comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict that would pave
way for a more normal political situation throughout the region.
   An administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that it was likely that the United States would
increase the number of Vietnamese refugees it takes as a result of
Hong Kong's action.
   However, the official said ``there are limits.''
   The official said that there is already a process under which
some Vietnamese refugees who escaped to Hong Kong have been given a
safe haven in the United States.
   Since the North Vietnamese conquest of South Vietnam in 1975,
the United States has accepted 930,000 immigrants from Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia, far more than any other country.

<HEAD>Bill Cosby Leads NBC to Another Ratings Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bill Cosby, who says he wants to come back
for another season at NBC, led the Nielsen television ratings again
for the week ended Dec. 10, according to figures released Tuesday.
   Cosby has told NBC that, contrary to published reports, he was
not considering taking his top-rated comedy series to CBS as part
of the network's attempt to buy Carsey-Werner Co.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was first, closely followed by NBC's
``Cheers.'' ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third.
   NBC won another sweeping victory in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey
with an average rating of 14.2. ABC was second with 11.9 and CBS
third with 11.3. A rating is the percentage of the nation's 92.1
million homes tuned to a show.
   The network is also ahead for the season. The ratings: NBC 15.0,
ABC 13.3, CBS 12.2.
   The Top 10 holds no surprises. NBC's entire Thursday schedule,
plus two comedies from Saturday, are included. ABC has one show and
CBS has two.
   Here's the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``Cheers,''
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``Dear
John,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
The ``Murder, She Wrote'' episode was a rerun.
   ``Dear John'' may take a dip in the ratings when NBC moves it to
Wednesday in early January and gives its time slot to a new comedy,
``Grand.'' NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff said at a
televised briefing for affiliate stations Monday that he felt
``Dear John'' was strong enough to survive the move. He added he
felt it would be compatible with ``Night Court.''
   Three of CBS' Monday night comedies showed improved ratings.
``Designing Women'' moved up to 18th place. ``Newhart'' was 21st
and ``Murphy Brown'' was tied for 26th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s highest-rated show continues to be
``Married ... With Children,'' which was 47th. The Fox shows are
down in the ratings since their late summer surge when Fox ran
original shows against network reruns.
   The ``ABC Saturday Mystery Movie'' presentation of ``Christine
Cromwell'' came in 77th, which put it near the bottom.
   ABC was first again in the news ratings with 11.2. CBS was
second with 10.2 and NBC was third with 9.9.
   The lowest-rated network show was ABC's ``The Koppel Report.''
Here are the five bottom network shows: CBS' ``Saturday Night With
Connie Chung'' and ``Snoops'' tied, CBS' ``Top of the Hill,'' ABC's
``Mr. Belvedere,'' ABC's ``Living Dolls'' and ABC's ``The Koppel
Report.''

   About 350 people tried to march on the U.S.
Embassy Tuesday to protest American support of Israel, but police
diverted the procession. There was no violence.
   It was the fourth night in a row that police allowed
demonstrators to assemble and march without a government permit.
Jordan has been under martial law for 22 years and public
demonstrations are banned. The series of marches reflected
government moves to relax restrictions.
   The largest march was held Monday with about 1,000 people
participating.
   The demonstrations have been held to mark the second anniversary
of the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli ocupation of the
West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip.
   On Tuesday the demonstrators gathered at the Professional Unions
building. Waving Palestinian flags and chanting ``PLO _ Israel
No!'' the crowd moved about 200 yards toward the American Embassy
about two miles away before police barred its way.
   The procession then turned toward the Palestinian-populated
Jebel Hussein neighborhood, with police clearing the streets, and
the marchers dispersed after several hours.
   ``We just want to tell the whole world that there is a
Palestinian society in Amman that's feeling the same as our people
on the West Bank,'' said Bannan M. Kassem, one of the marchers.
   Young men addressed the crowd, vowing support of the uprising
and denouncing U.S. support of Israel and the Israeli peace plan.
   Mohammed Saeed, a veteran Communist Party member who took part
in the march, said there have been occasional demonstrations in
Amman over the years but the last time he could remember so many
marches on consecutive nights was in 1956.
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran and King Hussein have promised to
ease martial-law measures and the government has loosened controls
on the news media.

   At Potsdam, where world leaders reshaped Europe at the end of
World War II, events brought East and West together again Tuesday,
to survey a Europe that is reshaping itself.
   At Potsdam, in the summer of 1945, the ``Big Three'' _
Churchill, Stalin and Truman _ reordered the postwar world.
   At Potsdam on Tuesday, the secretary of state, James A. Baker
III, met East Germany's new communist premier, Hans Modrow, with
far less certainty that they could fix, or even anticipate, the new
world order.
   Potsdam is a lakeside suburb of Berlin. It was the seat of power
of the Hohenzollern family, which ruled Prussia before World War I.
It was where word was flashed to Harry Truman that the atom bomb
had been successfully tested in the New Mexico desert.
   Truman told Winston Churchill about the bomb and Churchill
replied, ``This is the Second Coming, in wrath.'' Josef Stalin told
Truman that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan.
   At Potsdam, the three men agreed to the division of Germany and
accepted the Russian occupation of East Europe. It was to be a
temporary expedient, but, until the remarkable autumn of 1989, it
became a lasting arrangement.
   The hot war had not ended but the Cold War had started.
   Now _ maybe _ it is ending, at Potsdam, at the Berlin Wall, and
on the streets and in the parliament halls of East Europe. Mikhail
Gorbachev says it is already over but President Bush says he is not
prepared to go that far.
   Baker and Modrow met, just as Bush and Gorbachev met 10 days
earlier off Malta, to size up the direction of a world in flux.
   The secretary and the premier could not hope to take charge of
where it was going. People in the streets of Berlin had brought
down the wall with willpower and hammers and chisels. Berliners
brought down Erich Honecker, the old hardliner, and even Egon
Krenz, Honecker's more conciliatory successor.
   While Baker and Modrow met, Gorbachev was in Moscow staving off
an attempt in the Soviet Parliament to install a multiparty system
in the Soviet Union.
   In Czechoslovakia, the parliament formally accepted the
resignations of that country's ousted hard-line Communists, who sat
by with stony faces. From Sofia came word that the fever had spread
to yet another bloc country; Bulgarian Communist Party leader Petar
Mladenov offered to renounce the party's ``leading role'' and
engage in dialogue with his critics.
   One day's news from the East.
   Truman had not been in office four months and World War II had
not yet ended in the Pacific when he secretly boarded the USS
Augusta for the eight-day trip to Europe and his first meeting with
Stalin, whose arrival at Potsdam was delayed by a slight heart
attack, and with Churchill, who brought along opposition leader
Clement Attlee because it was uncertain who would win the election
at home.
   Britons had gone to the polls but the soldier vote had not been
gathered. Churchill and Attlee broke off the talks to await the
returns at home. When the vote was in, the wartime prime minister
had been ousted by a war-weary nation. Attlee returned to the
conference alone.
   The three leaders conferred over a 16-day period, agreeing on a
``provisional'' division of Germany that has lasted 44 years.
Truman asked for free elections in Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria.
   Stalin said no deal. According to historians Samuel Eliot
Morison, Henry Steele Commager and William Leuchtenburg, the Soviet
replied, ``Any freely elected government in these countries will be
an anti-Soviet government, and we cannot allow that.''
   The Soviets took over the Baltics and vast stretches of Poland;
they installed communist governments in East Germany and all the
lands they occupied when the fighting ended. Arrangements that were
intended to be temporary hardened.
   On Tuesday, the United States and East Germany conferred again
about the future.
   After seeing Baker, Modrow said, ``We started a dialogue with
each other today.'' But it was clear that the last word in this
dialogue will be spoken by the people.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III ventured into East Germany on Tuesday and offered U.S. economic
assistance to still another Soviet ally bent on reform.
   The bold and unprecedented visit to the site where the World War
II Allies decided the future of a vanquished Germany was made after
Baker sent a telegram to Moscow, advising the Soviets of his
intentions.
   In a 65-minute session with Prime Minister Hans Modrow and then
a separate talk in a 19th century church with Lutheran ministers,
Baker registered support for the changes sweeping the onetime
Stalinist state and said the Bush administration was prepared to
provide the kind of help due Poland and Hungary as they turn toward
market economies.
   But he emphasized that the change must be peaceful. U.S.
officials said Baker was concerned that retribution against fomer
Communist Party officials could turn into uncontrollable violence
with unpredictable consequences to its neighbors.
   Standing alongside Modrow at the conclusion of their meeting,
Baker said they had talked about ``the importance of moving forward
peaceably and in a stable way.''
   ``It is that, as much as anything else, that represents the
political signal that we desire to send by being here today,''
Baker said.
   The prime minister, who was lifted by the changes in East
Germany from a minor party post, told Baker the evolution in the
country, which will lead to multiparty elections in May, was
``irreversible,'' U.S. officials said.
   Modrow's public statement was cautious. He said his session with
Baker was the beginning of a dialogue that would turn out to be
cooperative.
   Baker's visit to Potsdam, the site of a 1945 conference that set
conditions for the post-World War II division of defeated Germany,
was added suddenly to his schedule late Monday night.
   In the morning, Baker sent a telegram to Moscow to advise the
Soviet Union of his plan. There was no immediate reply. But a
senior U.S. official told reporters on Baker's flight to Brussels
on Tuesday night for meetings later in the week with NATO and
European Community leaders that ``the Soviets will be very pleased
with the fact that we had this meeting.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both the
Soviets and the East Germans had advised the United States that
they wanted the reform to proceed. ``I don't anticipate any problem
at all from that standpoint,'' he said.
   Baker is the first secretary of state to hold talks with East
German officials. Two of his predecessors, John Foster Dulles in
the 1950s and William P. Rogers in 1971, visited East Berlin, but
they did not go beyond the Soviet-controlled sector of the former
capital.
   Former President Harry S. Truman's participation in the Potsdam
conference in 1945 carried him beyond Berlin. But Truman met with
Soviet leader Josef Stalin and British Prime Ministers Winston
Churchill and Clement Attlee.
   ``I felt it was important that we have an opportunity to let the
premier and the people of the German Democratic Republic know of
our support for the reforms that are taking place in this
country,'' Baker said when asked to explain the decision to go to
Potsdam.
   ``We wanted to make sure they are aware of the support that
exists in the United States forthe democratic process. We also
wanted to make it very clear that we support the process of reform
in a peaceful way,'' he said.
   The Lutheran ministers, some of whom were opponents of the
Communist government, assured Baker they would continue to advance
reforms while also doing what they could to keep the political
upheaval on a peaceful plane, the U.S. officials said.
   While Baker made no explicit promises to Modrow, they said, he
held out the prospect of lower tariffs provided the East German
government took legal steps to ensure the right to emigrate to the
West.
   He also told Modrow that East Germany could expect the same kind
of aid from the West that is being extended to Hungary and Poland
``if you carry forward with your reforms as you have promised the
people you are going to do, and you have a government that can
speak for the people and that represents the people,'' a senior U.S
official said.
   President Bush last month signed legislation for a $938 million
aid package for Poland and Hungary. Other Western countries and
Japan are engaged in parallel assistance programs.
   Before Baker crossed into East Germany he celebrated the opening
of the opening of the Berlin Wall and made a speech outlining the
Bush administration's proposed ``new architecture'' for a changing
Europe, with a larger role for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and closer U.S. ties to the 12-nation European
Community.
   Before driving over the Glienicke Bridge and past impassive
border guards, Baker visited Potsdamer Platz, where a new crossing
point in the Berlin Wall was opened last month.
   ``It's pretty impressive,'' he said as he toured the site with
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on a cold
late-autumn day.
   Demonstrators nearby protested against U.S. policies in Central
America, shouting ``Yankees out of El Salvador.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who met with Baker in West
Berlin, and Genscher have offered assurances to the Soviets that
the reunited Germany they are seeking would not threaten the
security of its neighbors.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned Genscher
last week that reunification could only bring trouble.
   Shevardnadze recalled the suffering from the German invasion in
World War II and told Genscher that ``propaganda about a federation
of two Germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the current
circumstances.''
   The Soviets denounced Kohl's recent 10-point plan for eventual
reunification as ``fraught with dangerous consequences and
bordering on outright diktat.''
   But Baker said events in Eastern Europe that ``under the old
rules of the game'' would have invited a Soviet crackdown have
produced no sign of it this time, the senior U.S. official said.
``Until we do, I don't think we are going to get it,'' he said.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., also arranged to see Modrow later.
   In a policy speech to the Berlin Press Club, Baker said ``the
United States and Canada share Europe's neighborhood'' and intend
to work with West Europeans to peacefully integrate a reunified
Germany into a Europe in which East-West tensions are subsiding.
   Baker has been pushing for a go-slow approach to reunification,
saying the future of the two Germanys should not be determined
exclusively by the German people.
   Baker suggested NATO oversee reductions of troops and armaments
in a treaty being negotiated with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and
take new steps to build economic and political ties with the East.
   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperation
must adapt,'' Baker said. ``Working together, we must design and
gradually put into place an architecture for a new era.''

   House Democrats angry about the
administration's overtures to China on Tuesday predicted strong
bipartisan support when Congress tries to override President Bush's
veto of a bill aiding Chinese students in this country.
   ``I think we have enough to override,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif. ``We feel the president's actions this weekend are such a
slap in the face to the forces of democracy and such an
encouragement of a tyrannical regime that it is making our job
easier.''
   Pelosi said she had received assurances from House and Senate
leaders, including House Speaker Tom Foley, that Congress would
make consideration of the veto override its first order of business
when it reconvenes in January.
   The vetoed bill, sponsored by Pelosi, would allow Chinese
students to remain in the United States indefinitely if they fear
retaliation at home. Bush contended he could accomplish the same
thing by executive order.
   The bill passed Congress overwhelmingly last month. Pelosi said
at a news conference that she was gaining commitments from
Democrats and Republicans to support an override, predicting a
strong bipartisan majority.
   Democratic leaders made clear their strong disagreement with
Bush's decision to send National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing over
the weekend for the first high-level meetings with Chinese leaders
since the crackdown in Tiananmen Square in June.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on international economic policy and trade,
called the trip ``an outrage ... a disaster.''
   He scheduled a Wednesday hearing on the trip and said
Eagleburger was invited to testify.
   ``The butchers of Beijing have been consolidating their power,
increasing tyranny in China, and the administation then goes and
sends two of its top people to China,'' Gejdenson said.
   ``What kind of message is this to those in the East bloc who
want to use military force to crush the democratic movements?'' he
asked. ``Is this a statement by the administration that it has one
standard for human rights in Eastern Europe, and another standard
for human rights in Asia?''
   Bush gained support, however, from Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who
called the criticism premature and said the trip was ``a risky but
thoughtful consultation'' that could lead to moderation by China.
   ``If China significantly moderates over the course of the next
year, Bush will be vindicated,'' Leach said. ``If not, the
administration runs the danger of being perceived as helping to
legitimize a less than legitimate regime in Beijing.''
   Haiching Zhao, chairman of the National Committee on Chinese
Student Affairs, met with Pelosi, later telling reporters the visit
will strengthen the hardliners in Beijing and encourage a ``slide
into darkness.''
   ``Taken together, the veto and the visit create a clear and
present danger that the hardliners in the Chinese government will
now feel free to impose more repression and further reprisals
against the democracy movement,'' he said.
   Zhao said thousands of young people are being jailed and
tortured in China, and that the government has begun a new round of
suppression against intellectuals.
   In the United States, he said, some Chinese students who have
demonstrated against their government have been intimidated and
harassed by Chinese authorities. He said the Chinese government has
warned students that if they persist, they will be regarded as
counter-revoluntionaries and punished when they return to China.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the
display of a 16-foot menorah in a Burlington, Vt., park is
unconstitutional because it violates the separation of church and
state.
   In a 2-1 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a lower court's decision allowing the city to issue a
permit to a Jewish group to erect the menorah in a park next to
City Hall.
   The menorah, the symbol of the Jewish religious holiday
Hanukkah, was displayed during the holiday season in 1986, 1987 and
1988. The 16-foot-high, 12-foot-wide candelabrum bore a sign saying
it was sponsored by Lubavitch of Vermont, a group of Orthodox Jews.
   The appeals judges based their decision on a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling in July that a creche inside a Pittsburgh courthouse was not
permissible but a menorah in front of a nearby government building
was because it was paired with a Christmas tree.
   Judges Edward J. Lumbard and Wilfred Feinberg said the high
court's ruling ``teaches that the display of a menorah on
government property in this case conveys a message of government
endorsement of religion.''
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Thomas Meskill said he did not
agree that the placement of the menorah next to City Hall gave the
impression that the display was government sponsored.
   ``Rather, the denial of permission to display the menorah would
constitute unnecessary hostility toward religion,'' Meskill said.
   Burlington City Attorney Joseph E. McNeil said he had not yet
seen the decision and could not say whether the city would appeal.
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a lawyer, a rabbi
and a Protestant minister living in Burlington which challenged the
display.
   ``Our reasoning was that it was a clear violation of church and
state, mainly because of its position with City Hall in the
background,'' said plaintiff Mark A. Kaplan, a lawyer who is on the
board of directors of the Vermont chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   The appeal followed a ruling in December 1988 by U.S. District
Judge Franklin S. Billings Jr. of Vermont who said the city could
issue a permit for the display.
   Kaplan, whose office is adjacent to City Hall Park in
Burlington, said the menorah is not on display now.

<HEAD>Lawyer Hands Out Money to Homeless in Search of Possible Relative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent corporate lawyer handed out $100
bills to the homeless as he searched in vain through a group living
under a freeway for a woman who may be a distant relative.
   ``I've got to find her,'' said Joe Jamail, who is best known for
winning a multibillion-dollar lawsuit for Pennzoil Co. ``I don't
want to sound like I'm some sort of grandstanding ham, but I want
to help that woman.''
   Joanne Jamail, 73, apparently was placed in a motel the night
before by a church group trying to get her out of the cold,
according to other homeless people at the highway encampment.
   Jamail first learned about the woman after she was interviewed
last week by The Houston Post under the freeway, where she has
lived for five months.
   ``I really need to find her if I can,'' Jamail said Monday. ``I
think I found Joanne a job working as a nanny for a friend of mine,
but I need to find her as soon as I can.''
   The 90-pound woman told the Post that her late husband, John
Joseph Jamail, had told her he was a distant cousin of Jamail.
   Jamail said Monday he had never heard of the couple, but that he
was eager to meet the woman to explore the possible family ties.
   The woman said she had to move out of her Galveston boarding
home after Hurricane Chantal tore the roof off this summer. She
said she couldn't find another place to live on her $205-a-month
Social Security check, and eventually wound up in Houston.
   She never called Jamail because she didn't want to ``impose'' on
him, she said.
   A circuslike atmosphere surrounded Jamail as he clutched a
fistful of $100 bills during his brief visit Monday to the downtown
area where the woman had lived.
   As he gave one man a bill for an apartment deposit he said, ``If
that's not enough, you let me know. And you let me know the minute
you hear or see Joanne.''
   Jamail represented Pennzoil when it won an $11 billion jury
award in its lawsuit against Texaco Inc. The two companies later
agreed on a $3 billion settlement.

   Foreign ministers from two dozen
Western nations gathered Tuesday for a conference designed to give
a fresh push to efforts to help the struggling economies of Poland
and Hungary.
   The meeting Wednesday at the 18th century Palais d'Egmont will
mark the first time the ministers have met to discuss the aid
package.
   During a Paris summit in July, President Bush and leaders of
other rich nations called for an aid program to speed up the drive
for more open political systems and market-oriented economies in
Poland and Hungary.
   They put the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, in
charge of coordinating the help.
   Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the European Community, said the
main purpose of Wednesday's meeting ``is to give sufficient
political momentum to follow-up'' the Paris summit.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Europe visiting
British and German officials, will attend the conference, as will
foreign ministers Joe Clark of Canada and Taro Nakayama of Japan.
Foreign ministers Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland and Gyula Horn
of Hungary will address the session.
   To date, officials say the nations, dubbed the Group of 24, have
pledged roughly $4 billion to $6 billion in a wide range of
financial aid, including loans, emergency food shipments and export
credit guarantees.
   Baker said in a speech to the Berlin Press Club that the United
States has authorized nearly $1 billion in assistance to the two
countries.
   ``Poland and Hungary have 40 years of economic stagnation to
overcome, and this will take time and our steady support,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the government will
contribute $150 million to an economic stabilization fund for
Poland. Poland has asked for one billion dollars in that pot.
   The ministers were considered likely to discuss whether they
should expand the aid program to cover some of the other emerging
democracies in the East.
   Baker said that as reforms in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East
Germany match those of Poland and Hungary, ``we believe the
activities of the Group of 24, centered around the EC, should be
expanded to support peaceful change in these countries as well.''
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the
community's executive body, said, ``My personal view is that this
operation should be extended as soon as circumstances permit to
(East Germany) and Czechoslovakia.''
   Michel Camdessus, head of the International Monetary Fund, said
during a visit Monday to Warsaw that a letter of intent for a $700
million loan agreement with Poland could be initialed this week.
   The deal would signal Poland's intention to adopt tough economic
measures and open the way for additional loans from the World Bank
and help in stretching out the country's $40 billion foreign debt.
   Hungary, which has been in the forefront of economic reforms in
the East, has a foreign debt of $20 billion, the highest per-capita
in Eastern Europe.
   It also is negotiating an aid package with the IMF. Government
officials are planning to put forward a ``crisis budget'' of
belt-tightening measures.
   Nations attending Wednesday's meeting are the community members
of Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
West Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece.
   The others are the United States, Canada, Australia, Turkey, New
Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, Norway and
Iceland.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Ambassador Urges Casolo to Cooperate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Salvadoran ambassador to the United States
said Tuesday that American Jennifer Casolo would likely be released
if she cooperated with police in an investigation of a suspected
rebel arms cache.
   Ambassador Miguel Angel Salaverria told reporters after a
briefing with Rep. Nancy Johnson, a Republican from Casolo's home
state of Connecticut, that the woman may have been unaware of arms
hidden in the backyard of her San Salvador apartment.
   But he said, ``She needs to say who she rented the house from.
... The more she cooperates, the easier it will be to end the
case.''
   Rumors of Casolo's impending release reached Washington Tuesday
_ generated by comments from her Salvadoran lawyer _ but the judge
handling the case said there was a ``misunderstanding'' and he had
made no such decision.
   In another development, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater apologized for remarks made last month shortly after
Casolo's arrest by Salvadoran police.
   ``It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there,''
Fitzwater said at the time. ``I mean, we're not talking about a
small package of pistols here. ... This is hardly a case of someone
having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home.''
   Congressional Democrats blasted Fitzwater for making comments
they said indicated to the Salvadoran government that the Bush
administration supported prosecution of the case.
   On Tuesday, Fitzwater denied that he had suggested Casolo was
guilty but added, ``I certainly apologize to anyone who feels that
they were offended by that.''
   Casolo, 28, went to El Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian
Education Seminars, a group dedicated to influencing U.S. policy by
organizing tours for Americans to learn about the civil war there.
   She and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a
police raid at her house. From the walled garden behind the house,
police said they uncovered 103 mortar grenades, 213 blocks of
dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945
rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made automatic rifles.
   She is being held for 90 days pending an investigation into
possible links between her, the explosives and Salvadoran rebel
forces.

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 103,632 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department said the corn was shifted by exporters from
``unknown destinations'' to the Soviet Union.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total 160,700 tons of soybeans, 705,000 tons of soybean meal,
and 7,300 tons of barley.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly
5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 298,700 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 103,632 tons of
corn would be about 4.1 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.22 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the department's five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of about $9 million.

   The Nicaraguan government and the
opposition have waged a dirty election campaign over the airwaves,
a U.N. report said Tuesday.
   U.N. pollwatchers, led by former U.S. Attorney General Elliot L.
Richardson, said the Sandinista government identifies ``the entire
opposition coalition'' with ousted strongman Anastasio Somoza's
National Guard and with ``counterrevolution, war and death.''
   The report criticized the opposition for contending that ``fraud
will be the only possible explanation for defeat'' in the election
set for February.
   ``In this atmosphere of anticipated fraud and the mixing of war
with politics, the electoral process is liable to lose its central
position,'' said the report by Richardson.
   ``If armed conflict emerges, even implicitly, as a possible
solution, the electoral process is bound to be perceived as a
secondary solution,'' he warned.
   On Sunday, an opposition rally in Masatepe, Nicaragua, broke
into a riot in which one person was killed and more than 20
injured. Foreign observers blamed the violence on Sandinista
provocateurs.
   ``Policy debate or genuine political proposals take backstage to
volleys of accusations and epithets,'' Richardson said in his
report, filed beforele
registered to vote, 88.5 percent of the potential electorate.
   Richardson credits Nicaragua's Supreme Election Council with
maintaining an ``impartial and flexible attitude'' in interpreting
election laws governing the campaign.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a July 1979 revolution that
overthrew the Somoza regime.

   Items Poland needs to whip food inflation
include chemical pesticides that have been targeted by federal
regulators and environmentalists, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Tuesday.
   ``We need to do whatever we can to improve agricultural
productivity in Poland,'' Yeutter told the National Press Club.
``Interestingly, there were two principle requests in this area.''
   The major requests were high-protein supplements for livestock
feed and agricultural chemicals.
   ``As we have experienced the situation here where folks are
wanting to ban agricultural chemicals in the United States, the No.
1 priority on the list in Poland was agricultural chemicals,'' he
said.
   But the aid package approved by Congress doesn't include such
chemicals.
   ``There's little that we can do, perhaps nothing that we can do
in the way of agricultural chemicals from a governmental
standpoint,'' Yeutter said, adding that the private sector may have
to meet Poland's request for farm chemicals through grants and
donations.
   Yeutter recently led a presidential mission to Poland to help
determine what kind of aid is needed to help that country rebuild
its agriculture.

   The five Central American presidents
demanded Tuesday that the region's two major guerrilla armies be
disbanded and asked for greater international involvement in the
search for peace.
   But skepticism surfaced quickly as to how effective the
agreement would be. ``I do not trust Daniel Ortega,'' said
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Cristiani spoke hours after he, Nicaragua's Ortega and the three
other presidents signed a statement critical of El Salvador's
rebels. Nicaragua steadfastly supported the leftist rebels in the
past.
   The presidents implicitly chided the United States, the Soviet
Union and Cuba by asking that ``nations with interests in the
region'' get more directly involved in the peace process. They also
requested increased U.N. involvement in the effort to demobilize
``irregular forces.''
   The two-day summit was the latest in a series that often raised
hopes but failed to bring peace to Central America. Presidents
Ortega, Cristiani, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala and host Oscar Arias of Costa Rica attended.
   The joint condemnation of guerrillas was viewed as a victory for
Cristiani and Ortega, but skeptics noted once again that neither of
the rebel armies concerned _ Nicaragua's U.S.-backed Contras and El
Salvador's leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN _ was represented.
   ``This continues to be the problem with all Central American
accords,'' said Luis Sanchez Sancho of the National Opposition
Union, a coalition that opposes Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government in elections set for Feb. 25.
   ``The FMLN can't be demobilized by an agreement among
governments because it is legitimate force with popular support
throughout El Salvador,'' the Salvadoran rebels said in a statement.
   A Contras spokesman said they would not lay down arms until they
could be certain that Ortega's promises of democratization and
tolerance were real.
   ``The presidents talked only about hypothetical situations that
don't correspond to reality,'' Luis Frey, known as Commander
Johnson, added in an interview with the The Associated Press in
Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   The presidents appeared to concede, with their calls for
increased involvement by other nations and by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, that they cannot bring
peace to the region by themselves .
   The United States still supports the Contras with non-lethal aid
and wants them to remain a force at least until the February
elections.
   The Soviet Union has reportedly scolded Cuba and Nicaragua for
shipping anti-aircraft weapons to the FMLN.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of
the pact, ``We're certainly skeptical. We remain to be convinced.''
   He said evidence exists that Nicaragua is not willing to live up
to its commitments about democratic reforms. But Fitzwater termed
``encouraging'' Nicaragua's agreement not to support Salvadoran
rebels.
   Cristiani told a news conference after returning home that
Ortega's record made U.N. involvement all the more important.
   ``The more he violates agreements such as these, the more his
own image will deteriorate rapidly,'' Cristiani said.
   For his part, Ortega asked the United States to ``support and
respect this accord, and to halt its sabotage.''
   The presidents called before for demobilization of the Contras,
but Tuesday was the first time they made a parallel call for
demobilization of the FMLN.
   The five ``energetically demanded'' that the Salvadoran rebels
``renounce all violence that directly or indirectly affects the
civilian population,'' a reference to last month's urban offensive
that embarrassed the right-wing Salvadoran government and left more
than 1,000 dead.
   The rebels reacted quickly, saying the declaration failed to
recognize the Cristiani government had ``bombed civilians'' and
``assassinated and persecuted the religious community,'' a
reference in part to the unsolved murders of six Jesuit priests
last month.
   The agreement was seen as a slap in the face for the FMLN
because it was signed by Ortega, their ally and supporter. Rebel
spokesman Antonio Hernandez refused comment when asked in Mexico
City if Ortega had sold them out.
   ``It has to be seen in the context of the summit,'' he said.
   The rebel statement said the accord helped the Salvadoran
government ``in exchange for a new promise to immediately
demobilize the Nicaraguan Contras.''
   The presidents asked U.N. help to cut off arms supplies to rebel
forces but omitted direct reference to Nicaragua despite the recent
discovery of two planes and a truck smuggling arms into El Salvador.
   The declaration also made no reference to increasing election
violence in Nicaragua that threatens to jeopardize the free and
democratic vote promised by the Sandinistas for February.
   Those elections were called in exchange for an August agreement
to disband the Contras by Dec. 5; the new agreement offers the
Contras a chance to participate in elections if they repatriate
themselves by Feb. 5.

<HEAD>Thousands Cheated With Bogus Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people who work for small
companies are being cheated of insurance coverage by bogus plans
sanctioned under federal law but living in a regulatory never-never
land, witnesses told a House subcommittee Tuesday.
   Both employers and employees are victims of the operators of the
plans, formally known as ``multiple employer welfare arrangements''
or less formally as ``health insurance arrangements,'' the Labor
Department's acting inspector general, Raymond Maria, testified.
   ``Within the benefit plan arena we are experiencing what I would
describe as a proliferation of multiple employer welfare
arrangements, known by many names, but I call them fraudulent
trusts,'' he said.
   Maria told the Government Operations Committee's subcommittee on
legislation and national security that the plans were permitted to
fill the vacuum left by the refusal of large insurance companies to
provide coverage for small employers.
   ``This vacuum is being filled by a number of fraudulent
trusts,'' he said. In one state alone, 3,000 participants have
become victims of fraud and are being held personally liable for
more than $3 million in medical costs, he said.
   About 5 million such trusts exist, he said. The operators of the
fraudulent ones sell their premiums at 20 percent to 50 percent
below the rates offered by legitimate operators, and the proceeds
are embezzled _ often through the payment to a backup insurer that
is really a ``shell company'' on a Caribbean island, he said.
   These operations are not licensed by state insurance regulators,
who have reserve requirements, and the outlaw plans do not maintain
reserves to pay claims. The operations run a typical pyramid game
in which claims are drawn out and lawyers are changed, he said.
   When the state tries to crack down on the operators, they claim
that the federal government has jurisdiction, said Maria and
Patricia Donovan Petersen, deputy insurance commissioner for
Washington state.
   Ms. Petersen told the subcommittee that she was constantly
frustrated in her efforts to get federal help _ even with
information _ in her 1988 investigation of two operators. She said
there wasn't even a list of companies.
   One ran programs known as the Western Business Association,
Western Timber Association and Western Alliance of Agriculture; and
one ran a program known as the Northwest Loggers Association.
   She said she was shuttled between the Seattle Office of
Inspector General and the Office of Pension, Welfare Benefit
Administration until she finally gave up and used what state court
action she could.
   By then, however, the operator of Northwest Loggers had left the
state with the program funds and ``hundreds of consumers in some
six states with thousands _ probably hundreds of thousands _ of
dollars of unpaid medical claims and with no medical coverage.''
   ``To date I know of no criminal, civil or other disciplinary
action taken or planned by any division of the Labor Department or
any other entity,'' she said, adding that the operator, Gary N.
Stone, has settled in Nevada and is setting up another plan.
   Unpaid medical claims for the other companies total at least
$100,000.
   ``This state has literally hundreds of these HIA's currently
providing coverage to thousands of state residents,'' she said.
``Without adequate regulation ... we can be certain that many more
consumers will be injured.''

<HEAD>Police, Soldier Die in Duel Following Argument Over Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A policeman and a soldier killed each
other in a shootout after a heated argument over last week's failed
coup attempt, the official Philippines News Agency reported Tuesday.
   It said the incident took place Saturday in Tabaco town in Albay
province, about 200 miles southeast of Manila.
   PNI quoted Capt. Robinson Ortega, Tabaco's police chief, as
saying Eduardo Retermoso of the Philippine Constabulary's Criminal
Investigation Service and Patrolman Herculano Bermel were drinking
at the public market when they argued about the coup attempt that
began Dec. 1.
   Each drew his handgun and fired at the other. Both died on the
spot.
   PNI did not say which sides the victims took.
   The agency said a government militiaman and a soldier were
wounded in another shootout in nearby Oas town.
   The coup attempt ended Saturday after rebel soldiers decided to
give up their last stronghold in Cebu Island in the central
Philippines. The failed coup bid left at least 113 people dead and
over 500 others wounded.
   The military reported meanwhile that soldiers on Tuesday raided
the houses of a suspected leader and a sympathizer of the aborted
coup and seized ammunition and radio equipment. The suspects were
not at home.
   PNI meanwhile reported that from $14.3 million to $23.8 million
in military equipment was lost during the mutiny.
   Brig. Gen. Epineto Logico, deputy chief of staff for logistics,
said that did not include ammunition used.

   Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists,
their ship damaged by the Navy during a protest last week of a
Trident 2 missile launch, said Tuesday they will observe an
upcoming launch but will not try to stop it.
   ``Our intention is not to physically obstruct the upcoming
Trident test, but to exercise our rights to protest in
international waters,'' said Shannon Fagan, a Greenpeace
spokeswoman.
   She said a 60-foot-ketch, the Mondeivitano, would sail to the
vicinity of the test site later this week ``and will maintain the
same distance from the site as other Navy vessels.''
   The Trident submarine launch area is in the Atlantic 50 miles
off Cape Canaveral. During a test launch, the Navy declares a
5,000-yard radius safety zone around the sub.
   Last week, the 190-foot MV Greenpeace with 25 protesters on
board penetrated the safety zone and dispatched two motorized rafts
in an effort to halt a launch from the submerged submarine USS
Tennessee.
   That tactic was successful in July, but last week the Navy was
ready. A submarine support ship bumped the Greenpeace several times
and used fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks to stop the
engines. Small Navy boats corraled the rafts, cut fuel lines and
towed them out of the danger zone.
   The Tennessee then successfully launched the Trident 2, the
Navy's newest, most powerful nuclear weapon.
   In Washington, the Federal Aviation Administration said it is
investigating another aspect of the Dec. 4 incident in which
Greenpeace operated a helicopter inside the launch area.
   FAA Administrator James Busey said that flight ``raises the
serious issue of whether the pilot intentionally violated federal
aviation regulations'' and said his agency is investigating. A
violation by a U.S.-registered aircraft could result in the pilot's
losing his flight certificate, the FAA said.
   Navy officials would not say what precautions were being made
for the upcoming launch in case protesters again tried to stop it.
   The MV Greenpeace suffered one three-foot gash and two smaller
ones in its hull and will be tied up in drydock for repairs for
several weeks, Fagan said.
   ``They may have dented our ship but not our resolve,'' Fagan
said. She said the Navy overreacted and deliberately rammed the
Greenpeace.
   ``The issue is not Greenpeace versus the Navy,'' she said. ``We
are, however, against nuclear weapons.''
   She said Greenpeace also will stage water-based and land-based
protest vigils near Port Canaveral where the Tennessee currently is
based.

<HEAD>Gov't Bombs Smugglers' Air Strips, Vote On Extradition Doomed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers destroyed airstrips used by
drug runners Tuesday and the traffickers appeared to be losing a
campaign to get a national referendum on extradition to the United
States, news reports said.
   A peace treaty with a Colombian guerrilla group also probably
will be lost, because it is part of a bill to which the referendum
proposal is attached.
   Security forces blew up 18 clandestine airstrips Tuesday in
northern Colombia, the televised ``Midday News'' program reported,
quoting military sources.
   The government has said it would continue its crackdown on the
drug trade despite three months of violence by traffickers.
Officials blame the drug barons for the bombing if a Colombian
jetliner Nov. 27 that killed all 107 people aboard, and a bomb last
Monday that killed 63 and wounded more than 1,000 in Bogota.
   Earlier this month, a proposed referendum on extradition was
attached to legislation that would amend the constitution and
includes provisions for election of former guerrillas to Congress.
   That measure, part of a treaty negotiated last year by the
government of President Virgilio Barco and the April 19 Movement,
known as M-19, would allow pardons for guerrillas and permit former
rebels to form a political party.
   A Senate committee had the legislation Tuesday, but was
reluctant to take it to the entire Senate. The 20 committee members
were not talking about the bill, and no one suggested it should
even come to a vote, the Bogota dailies El Tiempo and El Espectador
reported.
   If the legislation is not approved by the Senate by the time
congress adjourns Friday, it could die.
   Changes contained in the bill would assure former guerrillas six
seats in the 119-member House and six in the 104 member Senate.
   Members now are elected from a specific district and need about
20,000 votes to win. Former guerrillas would need a minimum of
4,000 votes, which could come from throughout the country.
   Under other constitutional changes, prosecutors and not
magistrates would investigate criminal cases and the country would
have a vice president. Someone now is designated to take over if
the president dies, but he has no regular role in government.
   The bill sets a national referendum on the constitutional
changes for Jan. 21.
   It was approved by the House of Representatives, with the
extradition rider, by a vote of 109-4, causing accusations in the
press of bribes and bullying by the cocaine lords.
   A statement from the traffickers, who call themselves the
Extraditables, said would not relent in their campaign of bombing
and assassination until a referendum on extradition was held.

<HEAD>Zambia Says Give South Africa Six Months to Abolish Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said
Tuesday that the international community should give South Africa
six months to abolish apartheid before clamping total economic
sanctions on the Pretoria government.
   Kaunda told reporters that when he met recently with President
F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, ``He said he was against apartheid,
he said he was going to work to remove it.
   ``Whether he will succeed, I do not know. We want to see if he
is going to push his parliament to abolish apartheid. If he does
not, then the Security Council should invoke mandatory sanctions.''
   Kaunda and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave keynote
addresses at Tuesday's opening of the General Assembly's first
Special Session on Apartheid.
   The United States or Britain has always used its veto power to
prevent the Security Council from imposing mandatory sanctions on
South Africa, except for a 1977 ban on arms trade with that country.
   They contend economic sanctions harm the black majority there
more than the white minority, and that the international community
can better influence Pretoria if it does not isolate the country.
   Black African nations and the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla group fighting to end white domination in South
Africa, demand comprehensive sanctions.
   A General Assembly call for all nations to sever economic,
military, sports and cultural links with South Africa has met with
partial success.
   South Africa usually seems to find ways to obtain petroleum and
other vital resources, though at higher than market cost.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the opening
session the assembly's longstanding opposition to apartheid ``is
squarely based on the universally shared perception that the
institution of apartheid constitutes a threat to international
peace and security.''
   South Africa's seats in the assembly were vacant throughout the
debate.
   The General Assembly in 1974 suspended South Africa's
participation and voting in the assembly because it refused to obey
the world body's calls to abolish apartheid.
   South African apartheid has established a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Community activists from across the nation
Tuesday swapped experiences and strategies from their often
isolated wars on narcotics at a conference dedicated to creating
``drug-free'' neighborhoods in the 1990s.
   The three-day conference ending Wednesday includes workshops on
substance abuse and prevention, drugs in schools and anti-drug
legislation.
   More important for some of the estimated 500 people in
attendance, it was an opportunity for encouragement and frank talk
about the challenges of battling an epidemic.
   ``The purpose is to indicate that no one in any state, in any
city, in any municipality is working on this problem by
themselves,'' said the Rev. Joseph Kakalec, a Philadelphia
activist. ``To encourage each other to go back to the communities
and take back the neighborhoods.''
   Jaci Feldman, director of drug programs for the National
Training and Information Center, said she hopes activists will
return to their communities with new tactics for the grassroots
drug war.
   Those attending the conference sponsored by the Chicago-based
center also worked on model legislation that, among other things,
would require a percentage of money seized from drug dealers be
returned to community organizations.
   Elsewhere, national drug czar William Bennett made rock n' roll
the medium of his anti-drug message Tuesday when he jammed on an
electric guitar for about 200 twisting and shouting junior high
students in Manchester, N.H.
   ``This combines two very interesting aspects of society _ the
principle of law and the principle of rock n' roll,'' Bennett told
the students as he joined a Manchester Police Department rock band
that carries an anti-drug message to schools.
   Bennett made sure the seventh and eighth graders from St. Joseph
Regional Jr. High School would remember him when he picked up the
rhythm guitar for a version of ``Twist and Shout'' with the band
``Friends in Blue.''
   At an earlier appearance in Concord, N.H., Bennett said he
approved taking custody away from addicted parents in extreme cases.
   ``Obviously, you give parents _ you give anybody _ the chance to
recover, to get better,'' Bennett said in an interview. ``But,
supposing the parent isn't getting better, shows no interest in
improving, going into treatment and it's adversely and dramatically
affecting the well-being of the child? The state can intervene.''
   At the Chicago meeting, groups new at fighting narcotics dealing
and veteran organizations discussed their problems and victories.
   Donna Jones, leader of a fledgling anti-drug group in Waterloo,
Iowa, talked with Herman Wrice, a Drexel University professor who
with several others began marching on crack houses in Philadelphia
two years ago.
   Mrs. Jones' group held their first anti-drug march a week ago
with about 100 people. Wrice began attacking crack houses with a
sledgehammer and a handful of supporters and now has a coalition
that involves at least 60 organizations who walk drug-infested
neighborhoods each week.
   It will take the involvement of community residents, not police
or the courts to rid the neighborhoods of drugs, Wrice said.
   ``You can stay inside your home and pretend how dangerous it is
and they'll (drug dealers) come to your house and take you on,'' he
said.
   The National Training and Information Center has previously
worked with organizations on issues including housing, utilities
and health care.
   Last spring, the non-profit center began administering a
federally funded program in nine cities to develop community
strategies for battling drugs. Representatives from each group
attended the conference to discuss their progress.
   Ms. Feldman said community residents were ignored for too long
in the drug war.
   ``They are the eyes and ears of their community, they know
what's going on in their community,'' she said.
   But increasingly authorities are encouraging the involvement of
community activists, and the involvement is growing, Ms. Feldman
said.
   ``What I've been hearing the last two days is `I'm tired of
feeling like a prisoner in my own home ... I have to get out of my
house and do something,''' she said.

<HEAD>West German Prosecutor Widens Chemical Arms Plant Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANNHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have expanded
their investigation into allegations that West German companies
helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant outside Tripoli, an
official said Tuesday.
   Peter Wechsung of the federal prosecutor's office in Mannheim
said criminal probes were opened against three high-level employees
of Salzgitter Industriebau AG.
   He told The Associated Press that Andreas Boehm, Salzgitter's
project manager for what Libya describes as a civilian
pharmaceutical plant, is suspected of violating West German laws
forbidding export of materials that can be used for chemical
weapons.
   Formal probes were opened against two other employees suspected
of giving false testimony to investigators.
   Wechsung said prosecutors are ``proceeding from the assumption''
that the plant was designed for making chemical weapons. He said it
was ``hardly conceivable'' no one among about 100 people involved
in the project at Salzgitter knew the plant's ``real function.''
   The United States said last year that the plant in the Libyan
desert at Rabta, about 60 miles from Tripoli, was intended to
produce poison gas.
   West German investigations of the Imhausen Chemie company, based
at Lahr in the Black Forest, led to charges against company
president Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen. Washington said the firm
masterminded the project.
   Salzgitter was mentioned as one of the companies providing
materials for the Libyan project.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Tuesday formally opened its congressionally mandated study of
competition in cable television and said it plans to complete the
job three months early.
   The 1984 legislation directing the commission to undertake the
study required a report by Oct. 28, 1990. The commission said
Tuesday it intends to submit its results by July 31.
   The commission adopted a ``notice of inquiry,'' the step by
which government regulatory agencies tell their regulated
industries what they plan to do.
   The notice adopted Tuesday asked for facts and studies about the
industry, recommendations for new rules or changes in existing
rules and recommendations for legislation.
   It also sought comments on, among other things, rates and the
possible regulation of rates, quality of service, competition and
the desirability of a possible requirement that every community
with cable service be assured that two companies would compete to
offer it.
   There have been complaints in Congress that cable companies have
been jacking up their rates to excessive levels.
   The National Cable Television Association said it welcomed the
notice and believed ``the industry has a positive story to tell.''

   Police said they arrested six

   Most of the explosives were in a stolen van in the driveway and
the rest in the garage, officers said. Fifty-four homes were

defused the explosives.
   ``The van was hijacked from a house nearby and a family,

   President Bush signed a bill Tuesday inspired
by the Iran-Contra affair to tighten restrictions on the sale of
military arms and equipment to nations deemed responsible for
international terrorism.
   Working on a stack of legislation left by Congress before it
left town, Bush also signed a bill to require all schools receiving
federal aid to adopt programs designed to prevent the use of
illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students.
   ``I believe these provisions will assist significantly our
struggle to rid our nation's schools of drug and alcohol abuse and
educate our young to the legal, social and health consequences of
such abuse,'' Bush said in a statement.
   In addition, he signed a measure that authorizes spending $127
million over four years to hire 700 new police officers in the
District of Colombia, which has one of the nation's highest
homicide rates.
   In signing the bill restricting foreign arms sales, Bush said,
``I wish to reemphasize this nation's strong determination to
oppose international terrorists and the states that support them.
   ``Curbing state support to terrorists is essential in reducing
the menace of international terrorism,'' Bush said.
   Federal law bans the export of military arms to countries found
guilty of international terrorism, a designation the United States
applies to Libya, Iran, Syria, South Yemen, Cuba and North Korea.
   In 1986, the law was amended to authorize a waiver of the ban if
the president makes a determination that such action is in the
national interest and so notifies Congress.
   By late 1985, however, the United States already had started
secretly shipping arms to Iran through Israel in what was judged to
be an attempt to win the release of American hostages held in
Lebanon. In January 1986, then-President Reagan secretly authorized
the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.
   Congress was not notified of the shipments until Nov. 25, 1986,
when the White House announced that arms had been sold to Iran and
that the profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   The new restrictions on arms sales, intended to close loopholes
in the law, require the president to report and consult with
Congress before the actual export of military goods to terrorist
countries.
   In signing the measure, Bush said he would interpret the law
``as placing no limit on our negotiations and communications with
foreign governments.''

   Cold air rushing southward from the Arctic Circle dropped
temperatures to more than 20 degrees below zero Tuesday around the
upper Great Lakes, and the Deep South braced for snow and
ice-covered highways.
   At 7 a.m. MST, Phoenix was chillier than Anchorage, Alaska, as a
relatively warm high pressure mass over Alaska squeezed the cold
air southward.
   Snow, sleet and freezing rain also pelted the mid-Atlantic
states, closing schools in much of Maryland and Washington, D.C.
   Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was 28 degrees
below zero at International Falls, Minn., and 13 cities in the
central part of the nation hit record lows.
   Morning lows fell below zero from the Dakotas to Michigan. On
the southwestern tip of Lake Superior, Superior, Wis., hit minus
21. Across the harbor from Superior, the low at Duluth, Minn., was
a record 22 below zero. Yankton, S.D., also fell to 22 below, a
record.
   Such severe cold doesn't even slow down shoppers in Duluth, said
Susan Latto, director of marketing for the Greater Downtown Council.
   ``It actually heightens it,'' she said Tuesday. She said the
cold reminds people that winter really is coming and they start
``getting serious'' about buying winter clothing.
   On the northern Plains, wind combined with the cold to produce
wind chill effects of 24 below zero at Jamestown, N.D., and 32
below at Fargo, N.D., at 6 a.m., the weather service said.
   Meteorologist Paul Heidt in Dickinson, N.D., took some of the
sting out of that, saying, ``Normally we'll get a cold spell like
this in November. We're overdue.''
   Even farther south, at Kansas City, Mo., Tuesday's low was a
record 5 degrees below zero. By late morning, the temperature had
climed to 14 above zero, the weather service said.
   Record low temperatures also were posted in Texas, including 12
degrees in Abilene, 8 in El Paso and 10 in Midland.
   In the mid-Atlantic states, all public schools and some colleges
closed in Washington, where snow started falling before dawn. But
the snow stopped at midafternoon in the District of Columbia with
only 1 to 2 inches on the ground.
   Most schools in Maryland were closed as a winter storm brushed
parts of the state and Delaware with up to 4 inches of snow. A
total of 8 inches was possible in some areas.
   Non-essential Maryland state employees were permitted to take
advantage of the state's liberal leave policy and Laurel Race
Course canceled its card because of the snow.
   Elsewhere, the cold pushed as far as the normally mild desert
Southwest, where the low in Phoenix was 36 degrees. Even Yuma,
Ariz., in the desert near the border with Mexico, chilled to 37
degrees.
   ``From Canada we have a flow of air straight out of the north
from southwest Canada. It's coming almost from the Arctic Circle,''
said Craig Ellis, head forecaster for the National Weather Service
office in Phoenix.
   ``It's because of a very high strong pressure area in the upper
atomosphere off the west coast of Alaska,'' he said. ``The warmer
air is pushing into Alaska and Canada and forcing the air
southward.''
   Ellis noted that at 7 a.m., when Phoenix hit 37, the temperature
at Anchorage, Alaska, was 45. The temperature climbed to 46
degrees, a record high for the date in Anchorage and as warm as any
place in the continental United States outside Florida or Georgia.
   The leading edge of the cold air also pressed into the South,
and schools in parts of northern Alabama closed Tuesday in
anticipation of sleet and snow that would make travel treacherous.
   Rain preceded the snowy cold front, with more than one inch
recorded in the Centreville area of west-central Alabama during a
12-hour period beginning at 6 p.m. Monday.
   A snow advisory was posted for northern Mississippi. At 7 a.m.,
freezing temperatures covered northwestern Mississippi and the
weather service said there were patches of snow in northern
Louisiana.
   Texas citrus and vegetable growers in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley braced for the arrival of freezing temperatures. The value
of this year's Texas citrus crop has been estimated at about $89
million.
   ``We get paranoid this time of year,'' said Bill Weeks,
executive vice president of the Texas Citrus and Vegetable
Association in Harlingen.

   Part of a door frame from a commuter
plane missing with eight people aboard was dragged up in a fishing
boat's net Tuesday, rekindling hope of finding more of the plane,
which disappeared two weeks ago.
   ``It has been identified as a piece of a door frame from that
aircraft,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a National Transportation Safety
Board spokesman in Washington, D.C.
   The aluminum piece was found in about 130 feet of water, he
said. The Coast Guard said it was just outside an area of Block
Island Sound where a sonar-equipped boat had spent six days
searching for the plane.
   Lt. Hank Leeper, who has been in charge of the search, said
divers were ready to check the bottom if scanning by a
sonar-equipped boat indicated there was larger wreckage.
   The New England Airlines plane has been missing since taking off
from Block Island on Nov. 28 for a 17-mile flight to the mainland.
   Debris found later, including part of a cabin panel and the
bodies of two dogs belonging to a passenger, indicated the
twin-engine plane broke up.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers opened fire Tuesday on
striking workers from the giant Itaipu Dam hydroelectric project,
killing two and wounding 10, the private station Radio Nanduti
reported.
   There was no immediate word from the government.
   The station's correspondent on the scene, 240 miles east of the
capital Asuncion, said the incident occurred when strikers tried to
prevent workers from entering the complex, jointly owned with
Brazil, on the Parana River.
   Hundreds of soldiers and anti-riot police from nearby Ciudad del
Este tried to disperse the strikers, who responded by throwing
stones.
   The strike began 15 days ago over pay and benefit demands by
employees. The strike was declared illegal by the Labor Ministry,
and dam officials said employees who refused to work would be fired.
   The incident was denounced by opposition political leaders.
   ``Not even in the worst periods of government by (former
President) Alfredo Stroessner did the army repress in this
manner,'' said Mina Feliciangeli, president of the leftist Workers
Party.
   Stroessner ruled this landlocked South American nation for
nearly 34 years until he was overthrown in a Feb. 3 coup. Coup
leader Gen. Andres Rodriguez was elected president last May 1.
   Itaipu Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric projects in the
world, has cost $18 billion since construction began in 1974 and
the first energy was delivered two years ago.
   At the peak of construction, the project employed 20,000 people.
Currently, 5,000 workers from both countries are employed.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Lobster Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
banning the import of undersized lobsters.
   The bill was backed by New England lawmakers who presented it
both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect U.S.
fishermen against Canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters.
   The lobster provision is contained in the $400 million
authorization bill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen.
William S. Cohen, R-Maine, first sponsored the provision after
Maine fishermen complained about Canadian competition.
   Fishermen argue that Canada's smaller minimum legal size of
lobsters has allowed Canadian fishermen to catch and sell smaller,
cheaper lobsters in U.S. markets.
   The legislation signed by Bush would place a market representing
roughly half of Candada's lobster exports off limits for the sale
of ``short'' lobsters.
   The current minimum legal size in the United States is 3\ inches
from the eye socket to the edge of the back where the tail begins.
The Canadian minimum is one-sixteenth of an inch smaller.
   Up to now, U.S. law has not regulated the size of imported
lobsters.
   In coming years, U.S. regulations would gradually increase the
minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in U.S. waters.
   Because Canada would not be bound by the increased minimum size
regulation, its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and
compete unfairly with their U.S. counterparts, lobster fishermen
argued.

<HEAD>Mexican Drug Lords Get 40 Years for DEA Agent's Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Mexican drug lords were sentenced Tuesday
to 40 years in prison each for the murder of U.S. narcotics agent
Enrique Camarena, ending a case that had dampened relations between
the countries since 1985.
   ``There is no chance of these sentences being reduced,''
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said.
   Rafael Caro Quintero, 37, and Ernesto Rafael Fonesca Carrillo,
56, were found guilty of masterminding the killings of Camarena, an
agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and his Mexican
pilot, Alvarez said.
   They were tried earlier this year, but convictions and sentences
are announced simultaneously in Mexico.
   Time for related convictions of kidnapping, drug trafficking and
weapons smuggling brought Caro Quintero's total sentence to 116
years and Fonseca's to 144. The sentences are to be served
concurrently.
   Fernando Arias, a spokesman for Alvarez, said Caro Quintero and
Fonseca would have to serve 74 and 53 years respectively because of
non-concurrent time remaining from previous sentences.
   He said there is no parole in drug-related cases, ``not even by
a single day.''
   Don Hamilton, spokesman for U.S. drug control policy director
William J. Bennett, said in Washington: ``It's certainly nice to
see people like Caro Quintero off the streets. I think the United
States and Mexico will both be the better for it.''
   Ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for
taking part in the killings, and 13 other men received lesser
sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by Caro
Quintero and Fonseca.
   All property and possessions of the two are being confiscated as
part of the penalty, Alvarez said. He had no figures for their
holdings, but said the ``list is very long.''
   Both are known to have millions of dollars in assets, including
ranches, aircraft, luxury cars, houses, apartments, hotels and
businesses.
   Tuesday's sentences were handed down by Judge Tomas Hernandez
Franco of the 4th Criminal Court in Guadalajara, where Camarena was
based. It is the capital of Jalisco state, 350 miles west of Mexico
City, and a major center for the drug traffickers.
   Alvarez, the attorney general, was governor of Jalisco at the
time of the Camarena killing.
   The slayings of Camarena, who was based in Guadalajara, and
pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, and the subsequent investigation
strained relations between Mexico and the United States.
   U.S. officials said Mexican authorities allowed Caro Quintero to
escape to Costa Rica, where he finally was captured. In an effort
to pressure the Mexican government for action, U.S. Customs
virtually blocked the border by conducting full searches of all
Mexicans trying to enter the United States.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office a year, has
made vigorous efforts to change Mexico's image as a haven for drug
dealers and corruption by jailing traffickers and arresting corrupt
officials.
   Caro Quintero worked with Colombia's cocaine cartels to smuggle
drugs to the United States through Mexico. His story and the
Camarena killing were the subject of a book and television movie in
the United States, both called ``Desperados.''
   He was sentenced to 34 years in another drug case earlier this
year and Fonseca was given 13 years. Arias said those will run
consecutively with the Camarena sentences.
   It was revealed in July that Caro Quintero and Fonseca had
bribed Mexico City prison officials to allow them to live in luxury
accomodations they had built inside the prison.
   Camarena was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara, and Zavala
Avelar a few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies, showing signs
of torture, were found March 5 on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   The bodies, wrapped in plastic bags, had been buried in shallow
graves.
   In a related case, Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, was arraigned Monday in
a Los Angeles court on charges of conspiracy in the Camarena
killing.
   Zuno Arce, a brother-in-law of former President Luis Echeverria,
is among 13 people in the United States charged in connection with
the drug agent's death.
   Alvarez said the Mexican government had no evidence against Zuno
Arce and there was no connection to Tuesday's sentencing.

   A six-man international ski and sled dog
team trying to make the first unmechanized crossing of Antarctica
settled in Tuesday at the South Pole, the halfway point in their
grueling journey.
   The expedition reached the U.S. Scott-Amundsen Scientific
Research Base Monday afternoon, said Jack Renirie, chief spokesman
for the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C. The
Foundation, an independent federal agency, runs the research base
as part of the U.S. Antarctica program, he said.
   Renirie, noting that it is government policy not to support
private expeditions, said he had been in contact with scientists at
the base who confirmed the International Trans-Antarctica
Expedition was there.
   Team members planned to remain at the Pole camped in tents
outside the base station until Friday, said Jennifer Kimball
Gasperini, spokeswoman for the group at its St. Paul-based
headquarters.
   ``Their time is well consumed by personal management, taking
care of their gear, sewing clothing, drying clothing, working on
their sleds and probably running the dogs a little bit each day to
keep them in condition,'' Kimball Gasperini said Tuesday.
   She said the group also plans to meet with film crews from
France that have been documenting the trek.
   After arriving at the South Pole, the group sent a misspelled
satellite message that read, ``Here we are. Horrah.''
   The expedition, led by Minnesotan Will Steger and Jean-Louis
Etienne of France, is the first to reach the bottom of the world by
dogsled since Roald Amundsen first did so on Dec. 14, 1911. Steger,
45, made history three years ago when he led a similar assault on
the North Pole.
   The adventurers already have traveled 1,992 miles from the tip
of the Antarctic Peninsula, where the trek began July 27.
   The goal of the 4,000-mile trek is to reach Mirnyy, a Soviet
science station on the continent's Indian Ocean shore, which is
1,600 miles and three months farther to the east.
   To get there, the troupe must cross the Area of Inaccessibility,
a 850-mile void of ice where neither radio nor airplane contact is
guaranteed.

   The Supreme Court president and a human
rights group on Tuesday criticized the government for turning over
a former Cabinet minister to the United States to face trial on
drug charges.
   Ex-Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez, also a former army
colonel, was flown to Miami on Monday with the approval of
President Jaime Paz Zamora.
   Paz Zamora, who arrived in Argentina Tuesday for a two-day
visit, told reporters there, ``It was a political decision that I
adopted personally.'' He said Arce Gomez faces numerous charges in
Bolivia and the government reserved the right to request his return
``when it believes that necessary.''
   Paz Zamora had said in La Paz that because of corruption in
Bolivia's judicial system there was no assurance Arce Gomez would
stand trial here.
   Last week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of Juan Carlos
Lisboa Melgar, considered one of the country's top drug
traffickers, ``for lack of evidence.'' And a Colombian chemist and
two other suspects accused of cocaine trafficking escaped from
detention over the weekend.
   Edgar Oblitas Fernandez, president of the Supreme Court, said
Arce Gomez should have been tried by Bolivian courts and he expects
``a convincing explanation from the government.''
   A citizens' committee pressing for trials in Bolivia of Arce
Gomez and ex-President Luis Garcia Meza issued a statement saying,
``We believe the judicial norms of the country have been violated
since an extradition treaty with the U.S. does not exist.''
   The Rev. Julio Tumiri, president of the Bolivian Human Rights
Assembly, said, ``The government's decision represents an affront
to our sovereignty and a violation of Bolivian law which
establishes that crimes committed on Bolivian soil must be tried in
the country.''
   Supreme Court charges against Arce Gomez range from theft to
genocide, involving the killings of critics.
   Arce Gomez appeared Tuesday in Miami before U.S. Magistrate
William Turnoff and was ordered held without bond on
drug-trafficking charges that could send him to prison for 30
years. An arraignment and formal bond hearing was set for Dec. 26.
   Gen. Garcia Meza came to power in a military coup in July 1980
and appointed Arce Gomez interior minister _ the top law
enforcement post.
   Garcia Meza resigned in August 1981 and both he and Arce Gomez
fled Bolivia before an elected government was installed in 1982.
   Arce Gomez, known as the ``cocaine minister,'' went to
Argentina. He was arrested there under the Miami indictment, issued
in 1983 on two counts of drug trafficking, but was freed in
December 1983 by Argentina's outgoing military regime before a
civilian government came to power.
   He was arrested Sunday night at a ranch near Santa Cruz, 350
miles east of La Paz.
   Garcia Meza returned to Bolivia in 1988 and his lawyers said he
was ready to reply to charges against him. But he fled again when
the Congress early in 1989 accused him of theft and corruption. He
is sought by police but it is believed he has left Bolivia.
   Paz Zamora said in Buenos Aires that Arce Gomez and Garcia Mesa
tried to ``set up a Bolivian government on the base of narcotics
trafficking, and unite the economic power of narcotics trafficking
with the political power of the state, which is what (some) want to
do today in Colombia.''

   About 100 survivors of the German
battleship Graf Spee that lost one of the first major naval battles
of World War II attended Mass Tuesday to mark the 50th anniversary
of the encounter.
   ``It's emotional and painful to remember,'' said former German
sailor Bernard Schmitz, 72, of Duisburg, West Germany. ``How did I
feel? I was tremendously afraid. It was a lucky thing to have
escaped alive.''
   The survivors, most of whom came from Germany for the memorial
ceremonies, also visited the graves of comrades who perished in the
battle. Thirty-six Germans died in the clash, as well as 72 British
sailors.
   British and New Zealand navy veterans who were in the battle
were invited to the reunion that will continue with events for the
next two days in Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital across the
River Plate from Montevideo.
   ``The war is a thing of the very distant past,'' said Maximo
Umbreit, 72, who came from his village near Heidelberg, West
Germany. ``At that moment, everyone did what they had to do. We
feel sorrow for our dead, but also for the British.''
   On Dec. 13, 1939, the Graf Spee, which sank nine British
merchant ships at the outset of the war, approached what it thought
was a convoy carrying beef and grain to Britain from Uruguay and
Argentina.
  here's a perception that oil prices are going to be moving
higher next year.''
   Oil companies accounted for seven of the 13 most actively traded
issues on the Big Board.
   Phillips Petroleum and Exxon traded the most heavily, with
Phillips up 1] to 25~ and Exxon up 1{ to 51\. Phillips' rise was
attributed to a $250 million stock buyback announcement Monday and
a higher earnings estimate for 1990.
   Among other oil issues, Pennzoil gained 1] to 87|, Royal Dutch
Petroleum shot up 3\ to 76}, Mobil increased 1| to 63, Texaco
gained 1{ to 57[, Chevron rose 1\ to 68[ and Unocal was 1{ higher
to 30|.
   ``The market was fairly firm all day long,'' said David Bennett,
a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It was
trending higher all day.''
   Contributing to the Dow industrials rise, Procter &amp; Gamble
surged 3 to 68\ as the firm estimated that net income for the
fourth quarter would rise 27 percent from a year ago, and UAL
gained 2} to 176}.
   Otherwise, traders said the market generally was biding time
until the release on Friday of reports on the producer price index
for November and the October trade deficit. Friday also brings
expiration of stock-index futures and options.
   Technology issues mostly declined. In the national
over-the-counter market, Apple Computer fell 3 to 36\ in heavy
trading after projecting an earnings decline and slowing sales
growth for the first quarter of fiscal 1990.
   Intel was down ] to 32, Compaq fell \ to 81] after a weak
earnings forecast, International Business Machines added ~ to 97,
Hewlett-Packard lost [ to 45| and Digital Equipment up ] to 84].
   Land's End slipped 2~ to 20~ a day after reporting it expects
fiscal year earnings to be 13 percent lower than a year earlier.
The mail-order retailer tumbled 4| Monday after the announcement.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   Newly elected Politburo member Alexander
Lilov told a major Communist assembly on Tuesday, ``The most
important question to ask is why the system breeds dictators and
why it tolerates them for so long.''
   His surprising comments came as he and others denounced the
demoted party leadership at a key session of the Bulgarian
Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee. New personal
attacks were made against disgraced longtime leader Todor Zhivkov
as thousands rallied for further reforms.
   About 20,000 Bulgarians stood in a candlelight vigil in the
plaza outside, making clear they would keep up pressure for fast
and effective political change despite new party chief Petar
Mladenov's promises of reform.
   Mladenov proposed on Monday, opening day of the closed-door
meeting, that the party give up its guaranteed monopoly on power
and talk with independent groups. He also proposed free elections
by May 1990.
   The developments came a month after Zhivkov was ousted after a
35-year regime. Mladenov, formerly foreign minister, took office
when Zhivkov and his Stalinist old guard were forced out Nov. 10.
   Georgi Grigorov, newly elected first secretary of the Sofia city
committee, told Tuesday's meeting the party was ``beheaded in terms
of personnel'' _ in desperate need of competent economic managers
and ideologists.
   Lilov, voted into the ruling Politburo on Friday after Zhivkov
kept him away from the power center for years, said Zhivkov's
legacy was ``a degradation of party principles and ethnics,'' the
state news agency BTA reported.
   He renewed calls for punishment of Zhivkov and his closest
associates.
   ``The culprits for this crisis'' should be named and ``held
politically and, in some cases, criminally liable,'' BTA quoted
Lilov as saying, meaning they should be tried in court.
   Premier Georgi Atanasov echoed Mladenov, who on Monday gave a
grim account of Bulgaria's crisis-ridden economy. Bulgaria, with a
population of 8.9 million, is saddled with an overall Western debt
of about $10 billion.
   ``We can hardly point to a sub-branch and even a single
production which is competitive on the free international
markets,'' said Atanasov, who took over as prime minister in 1986.
   The candlelight vigil was the third such quiet demonstration in
two days.
   Some put their candles on window ledges of the Central Committee
headquarters _ ``because it's right under their noses,'' two young
men explained. A guard soon came, blew out the candles and threw
them away.
   One demonstrator declared: ``It's right under their temple.
Let's hope sooner or later we are going to bring that temple down.''
   Earlier Tuesday, 3,000 assembled in the plaza for a daylight
vigil.
   Deyan Kiuranov, a spokesman for the influential environmental
group Eco-Glasnost, said Tuesday the party ``regained some face''
through Mladenov's speech. On Monday, Eco-Glasnost became the first
officially registered independent group in Bulgaria.
   Kiurianov told Western reporters he thought independent groups
would accept Mladenov's offer of immediate dialogue.
   At a rally on Sunday, more than 50,000 people cheered calls for
the entire Central Committee to resign.
   Independent groups that sponsored the demonstration have called
for ``round table'' talks with the Communist leadership, like those
held in Poland last spring and East Germany this month.
   Kiuranov also is active in the new Union of Democratic Forces
alliance of 10 independent groups, and said it would ``play a very
active political role'' in the elections Mladenov proposed.
   He conceded little time remained for the opposition to organize,
but predicted early elections would ``act as a unifying force'' for
his alliance.
   Some people questioned in the street were skeptical of
Mladenov's ability to separate himself from the Zhivkov regime,
where he spent 18 years as foreign minister.
   ``I could trust Mladenov if he gained the peoples' trust,'' said
a housepainter, who would not give his name. If the new leader
``doesn't get rid of those around him, the people won't trust
him,'' he said.
   Many people, conditioned by the distrust and fear of two
generations, refused to speak.
   Mladnov proposed Monday that a special party congress be held
March 26 and the current term of the entire party leadership end at
that time, which would be tantamount to collective resignation.
   Kiuranov described that as ``a halfway step'' to meeting
opposition demands, ``but also a halfway step to counter them.''
   Since taking office, Mladenov has reorganized the party's ruling
Politburo twice to remove hard-liners who served under Zhivkov.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Human Rights Abuses Continue in Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murder and torture continue in the war zones of
Sudan despite the change of governments, Amnesty International said
in a report released Tuesday.
   The human rights group said soldiers killed 34 civilian
detainees in the southern garrison town of Wau on July 19, three
weeks after the military took power in a coup.
   ``It is believed that the armed forces have done nothing to
punish those responsible for these unlawful killings,'' the report
said. ``The military government's apparent lack of response to the
killings in Wau and its continuing detention of political opponents
in the north of Sudan is a cause for grave human rights concern.''
   London-based Amnesty International said prisoners held by the
military have been tortured to force confessions.
   ``A well-reported instance of cruel tying on 10 March 1989 in
the South Kordofan town of Meiram caused the death of one man and
led to the eventual amputation of the arms of two others,'' the
report said. ``Similar cases are known from the towns of Delami,
Ad-Damazin, Chali and Juba.''
   It said there were reports of some victims having their wrists
and elbows tied behind their backs and others had their ankles
bound to their wrists and then left face down.
   Gross abuses also have been carried out by militias supplied and
supported by the armed forces and successive Sudanese governments,
according to the report. It said some of the most serious abuses
have involved militias formed among the nomadic Rizeiqat and
Misseriya peoples of South Darfur and South Kordofan.
   ``Successive administrations, including the current military
government, have failed to act forthrightly against deliberate
killings and torture in and around areas of armed conflict,'' the
report said.
   ``Since the outbreak of war in 1983 there have been few official
investigations into human rights violations and, as far as Amnesty
International is aware, no prosecutions for unlawful killings or
torture. This amounts to a willful failure by the Sudan government
to protect basic human rights.''
   The organization said human rights also are violated by the
rebels' Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army.
   ``The SPLA has extrajudicially executed prisoners, such as
government troops and militia captured in combat, suspected
government informers and civilians thought to be opposed to the
SPLA,'' the report said. ``It is believed that some hundreds of
captured government troops were killed in Bor in March 1989. There
are also reports of extrajudicial executions of civilians by the
SPLA in South Kordofan and Equatoria''

<HEAD>Heavy Snow Over the Middle Atlantic States, Record Cold in the Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge storm spread snow Tuesday over much of the East and
hurricane-force Santa Ana winds in Southern California knocked out
power to more than 20,000 homes, closed two interstates and did
widespread damage.
   Frigid weather gripped the central United States, breaking
low-temperature records up to 57 years old in 11 cities and tying
them in two.
   The storm centered over northern Georgia had dropped up to 3
inches of snow on Virginia by mid-morning.
   Winter storm warnings were up in sections of Maryland, Delaware,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas and Alabama and winter
storm watches were up in Georgia and Tennessee.
   Snow advisories were posted in most of those states, as well as
Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C.; and Mississippi. Gale
warnings were up for the middle Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over the central Gulf Coast.
   The Santa Ana winds that have plagued Southern California since
Sunday night on Tuesday caused heavy damage in Los Angeles, Orange,
San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
   Blowing dust and sand in desert areas cut visibilities to almost
zero, closing Interstates 15 and 60 east of Ontario, Calif. The
winds downed power lines, cutting service to more than 20,000 homes
and igniting several brush fires in Riverside County.
   The north central United States also had gusty winds, along with
light snow.
   The snow fell mainly over eastern Montana and the Dakotas, and
an advisory for snow and blowing snow was up for western South
Dakota.
   In Cheyenne, Wyo., winds gusted to 55 mph. A high wind warning
up in effect for the mountains of southeastern Wyoming.
   Temperatures dropped below freezing Tuesday morning in the Great
Plains and along the northern Atlantic Coast, with temperatures in
the teens and single digits in much of that area.
   The mercury dipped below zero in the Rockies, Dakotas,
Minnesota, Iowa, the lower Missouri Valley, northern Illinois,
Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, Lower Michigan and northern Maine.
   Temperatures remained below freezing Tuesday afternoon from the
northern High Plains to the Mississippi Valley and New England, and
were still below zero in northeast Minnesota.
   A freeze warning for Tuesday night was posted in southern Texas'
lower Rio Grande Valley as blustery north winds ushered cold arctic
air into the wesern Gulf Coast.
   Readings were in the 30s in normally sunny Southern California
and southern Arizona. A frost advisory was in effect in some
agricultural sections of Southern California.
   The morning low for the Lower 48 states was 28 degrees below
zero in International Falls, Minn. It was 22 degrees below zero in
Duluth, Minn., where the old record for the date of 17 had stood
since 1962.
   Low-temperature records were also set in Ablilene, Texas (12
degrees, 15 in 1932); El Paso, Texas (8, 16 in 1953); Kansas City,
Mo. (5 below zero, 4 below in 1932); Marquette, Mich. (7 below, 5
below in 1970); Midland, Texas (10, 12 in 1966); Moline, Ill. (9
below, 6 below in 1962); Omaha, Neb. (5 below, 4 below in 1932);
Traverse City, Mich. (8 below, 7 below in 1958); Wichita Falls,
Texas (10, 12 in 1952); and Yankton, S.D. (22 below, 18 below in
1932).
   Records were tied in Burlington, Iowa (10 below in 1962) and
Fort Worth, Texas (18 in 1932).
   By contrast, it was a relatively balmy 46 degrees in Anchorage,
Alaska, a record high for the date and as warm as any place in the
continental United States outside Florida and Georgia.

   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whose
office has been near the center of a federal probe into illegal
bingo gambling and public corruption, was shot in the head Tuesday
in an apparent suicide attempt.
   Doctors removed damaged brain tissue and the bullet lodged in
his skull during more than four hours of emergency surgery Tuesday
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Crowell was listed in very
critical condition.
   ``The path that the bullet took is not one that would kill
one,'' said Dr. Joseph C. Ross, vice chancellor for health affairs
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
   Crowell was found by a son, Brooks, about 6:45 a.m. on the porch
of his home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. Police
said Crowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a
.38-caliber revolver found next to his hand. He did not leave a
note and police declined to speculate on any reason.
   ``He had a gunshot wound with the bullet actually going up into
the brain. There was a lot of bleeding and it destroyed a lot of
tissue,'' Ross said. ``It's impossible to know at this time what
residual damage there might be.''
   He said doctors are trying to reduce swelling around Crowell's
brain and prevent infection.
   Several Democratic legislators were waiting outside the
hospital's neurological intensive care unit, where Crowell was
taken after surgery.
   The reaction to Tuesday's shooting was one of shock on Capitol
Hill.
   ``It's just terrible, a tragedy like this,'' Gov. Ned McWherter
said. ``It's just unbelievable to me.''
   McWherter, a former House speaker, and Crowell were close
politically when Crowell's partisan chairing of the House Calendar
Committee earned him the name, ``The Godfather.''
   Lt. Gov. John S. Wilder, near tears, declined to comment.
   Sen. Robert Rochelle, a Democrat from Crowell's home town of
Lebanon, called Crowell ``a private person who does not talk about
things. He doesn't talk about his problems.''
   ``Depression is a terrible thing. I didn't realize that Gentry
had anything bothering him to that extent,'' said House Speaker Ed
Murray.
   Crowell's wife, Terrijean, and son Brooks were the only family
members at home when the shooting happened, police said. Brooks
Crowell heard a shot and found his father outside. The couple also
have two other children.
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents are probing the
shooting to make sure foul play was not involved, said TBI Deputy
Director John Carney.
   Crowell, 57, was elected secretary of state by the Legislature
in 1977 after serving four terms in the state House.
   Crowell has testified twice before grand juries investigating
illegal bingo gambling and public corruption, including last month
in Memphis. He said then he had been assured by federal
investigators they were not seeking an indictment against him.
   Crowell has not been implicated in the probe, but one of his
former employees is serving a prison term in connection with it.
Another was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in connection
with the operation of a Memphis bingo hall.
   Twenty-two people have been indicted or pleaded guilty this year
in the investigation.
   Bingo had been legal for charity purposes but reports showed
that fake charities often were set up to run the games and money
was siphoned off illegally.
   All permits for the game were revoked this year after the
Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that it was a lottery, in violation
of the state constitution.
   Under Tennessee law, the governor can appoint an interim
replacement for Crowell or wait for the Legislature to do so when
it convenes next month.
   David Welles, McWherter's legal counsel, said the governor would
probably wait for the Legislature to act. The office will be run in
the meantime by Crowell's executive assistant.

   The National Security Council met in
emergency session Tuesday to try to quell the surge in violence
that has left more than 100 Sinhalese dead in three days.
   A military official said anti-government Sinhalese killed 54
men, women and children and set fire to 102 vehicle and 13
state-owned buildings since Sunday. The official, who was not
identified under briefing rules, said all the victims were
Sinhalese and were shot or hacked to death.
   Police reported Monday that the bodies of 65 anti-government
Sinhalese were found in central and southern Sri Lanka. They said
the victims were killed by vigilantes supporting the government.
   The official said that in the worst attack by extremists of the
People's Liberation Front, 35 people were killed in Matara
district, 85 miles south of Colombo. Pamphlets left near the bodies
said the people were killed because they were members of the
governing United National Party or government informers, according
to the official.
   The People's Liberation Front is waging a campaign against the
government to protest a peace accord signed in 1987 to end a
rebellion by Tamil militants.
   Tamil separatists have been fighting since 1983 for their own
homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka. The Tamils, most of whom are
Hindus, accuse the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority of
discrimination.
   The most powerful separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, rejected the 1987 pact and has continued its guerrilla
warfare.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed in violence related to
the People's Liberation Front campaign and an additional 11,000
have perished in the Tamil uprising.

   A House panel began an investigation Tuesday
of ``apparently contradictory'' methods used by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in deciding whether to allow the Seabrook
nuclear plant to open.
   Rep. Peter Kostmeyer, D-Pa., chairman of the House Interior
Committee oversight and investigations subcommittee, demanded
answers from NRC chairman Kenneth Carr on NRC procedure.
   ``This inquiry has been prompted by the steady erosion of safety
standards enacted by Congress following the major nuclear accident
at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, and by the extraordinary
series of apparently contradictory actions recently taken by the
commission and its licensing board concerning the application for a
full-power operating license at Seabrook Station in New
Hampshire,'' Kostmeyer said in a letter to Carr.
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said the letter had not been
received, but would be responded to promptly.
   ``The commission is following its usual license procedures on
Seabrook,'' Ingram said.
   Legislators from around New England called for the investigation
last month after the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
recommended that Seabrook should be awarded a license.
   Kostmeyer cited a recent dispute in which the licensing board
downplayed concerns raised by the NRC's higher level Atomic Safety
and Licensing Appeal Board about the adequacy of New Hampshire
evacuation plans.
   ``It is apparent that the commission is dangerously close to
twisting the intent of Congress to a point where it can no longer
be said that the public health and safety protection afforded by
one emergency plan is equivalent to another,'' Kostmeyer wrote.
   Kostmeyer was particularly concerned that the licensing board
issued a final decision on Massachusetts evacuation plans only two
days after the appeal board raised its concerns about the New
Hampshire plans.
   The letter to Carr included 11 questions about NRC procedure and
requested answers no later than Dec. 20. Among other things,
Kostmeyer asked whether the geographic location of a plant and the
relative difficulty of evacuating residents from that area was
relevant in licensing a plant.
   Mike Connolly, an aide to U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said
there was no immediate word on how soon the oversight committee
would begin hearings.
   In a related development, the licensing board dismissed a
complaint Tuesday about the adequacy of an emergency drill at the
Seabrook plant and said the Massachusetts attorney general filed
his concerns too late.
   Ron Sher, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee Electric Co., the
operater of the plant for the multi-company owning consortium,
said, ``Seabrook station has been the most closely scrutinized
nuclear plant ever licenses and the in the 18-year licensing
history of Seabrook intervenors have had ample opportunity to make
their case.''
   Sher said experts had found the emergency plan ``one of the best
in the country.''

   Following are excerpts from the
statement issued Tuesday at the end of a conference by five Central
Central American presidents, as translated from the Spanish by The
Associated Press:
   Presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras
and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua:
   _Ratified ``their most energetic condemnation of armed and
terrorist actions mounted by irregular forces in the region'' and
reiterated ``their deepest conviction that it is imperative for
people to understand the use of force and terror to attain
political objectives must be discarded.''
   _Expressed their support of Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani and his government as a product of ``democratic,
pluralist and participative processes.''
   _``Energetically demanded'' that the Salvadoran rebels _ the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front or FMLN _ ``renounce all
violence that directly or indirectly affects the civilian
population.''
   _Reiterated their ``vehement call to the FMLN to immediately
cease hostilities in this brother nation and incorporate themselves
into the process of dialogue.''
   _Reiterated ``the importance of international cooperation as a
parallel and indispensable element in the political attempt to
pacify the area'' and asked the secretary general of the United
Nations ``to establish the necessary links for more direct
involvement in the peace effort of those states with interests in
the region.''
   _Declared the recently dispatched U.N. observer force should
``accelerate its activities to prevent the delivery of arms to the
FMLN and the Nicaraguan Resistance'' and should ``immediately
initiate actions to demobilize the FMLN'' and Nicaraguan rebels.
   _Noted that Nicaragua had reitereated its offer ``to allow
Contras (rebels) who repatriate before Feb 5, 1990, to register (to
vote) in order to exercise their suffrage in the Feb. 25 general
elections.''
   _Offered their support for Nicaragua's call for U.S. funds for
the Contras to be used to ``carry out the demobilization,
repatriation or voluntary relocation in Nicaragua or third
countries of members of the Nicaraguan Resistance and their
families.''

   Prague's rollback of communist rule prompted
cancellation of a planned U.S.-Czechoslovak meeting on humanitarian
affairs next week, both sides said Tuesday.
   The session may be rescheduled once Czechoslovakia's new
government _ the first in 40 years not under communist domination _
frames its policies, they said.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Evzen Vacek was to have met next Monday
with Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for
humanitarian affairs and and other U.S. officials in a continuing
dialogue on human rights issues.
   ``We suggested they not meet'' until Czechoslovakia completes
its internal changes, said State Department spokesman David Burgess.
   At the Czechoslovak Embassy the meeting was described as
``postponed,'' and spokesman Karel Tregler said ``It is necessary
to re-prepare negotiations ... the humanitarian cases have been
solved.''
   Schifter told Czechoslovakia's government director of religious
affairs, Vladimir Janku, at an October meeting, that the price for
improvement of relations with the United States was that ``human
rights conditions improve dramatically'' in the Central European
country.
   This has indeed been happening the past month, said a State
Department expert.
   ``Many of the human rights considerations have been dealt with
constructively ... they have achieved a fantastic amount in a few
weeks. The situation is very improved, they have freed many
political prisoners, codified free speech and religion,'' he said,
talking on condition of anonymity.
   Czechoslovakia's former government entered the U.S. talks as
part of a campaign to attract American investment and technology
and to receive U.S. tariff concessions on its goods known as Most
Favored Nation treatment, similar to those sought by the Soviet
Union.
   The campaign has continued amid political change in Prague. A
deputy trade minister, Jiri Nemec, restated his country's desire tp
strengthen economic relations during talks last week at the State
and Commerce departments, the embassy said.

   A suspended rural county judge Tuesday
took the stand to deny public corruption charges against him in the
elegant courthouse prosecutors say he ruled like a monarch.
   Cambria County President Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki spent 5{ hours
disputing testimony from prosecution witnesses, including
allegations he twice wore only bikini underwear in his chambers and
once touched a secretary's breasts.
   ``That did not happen,'' O'Kicki said, denying the testimony of
two secretaries who said that on separate occasions he called them
into his office while he was wearing only his briefs.
   O'Kicki, 59, faces a total of 10 charges for alleged violations
spanning more than a decade, including bribery, extortion, coercion
and open lewdness.
   Asked Tuesday about an alleged attempt to get a kickback from a
Johnstown attorney after O'Kicki gave a favorable verdict, the
judge said he was joking.
   ``I said, `Judges would not need a raise if commissions were
given for the verdict just reached. He laughed and I laughed,'''
O'Kicki said.
   O'Kicki, 59, said he was lobbying state lawmakers at the time
for a pay raise for judges on behalf of the Pennsylvania Conference
of State Trial Court Judges.
   The charges against him span more than a decade.
   Northhampton County Judge Richard Grifo, who is presiding over
the trial that began Nov. 7, said last week he expected the case to
go to the 12-member jury on Thursday night.
   Among the charges O'Kicki denied were:
   _ Pressuring Laurel Bank to lower the interest rate on a loan in
return for favorable treatment in a case before the judge.
   _ Offering to put up money for a handyman he had hired to bid at
an auction on an estate under the judge's jurisdiction.
   _ Forcing court employees to act as his chauffeur and chop wood
at his home as part of their jobs.
   _ Asking a staffer to give him $500 for a job promotion, which
was never offered.
   _ Threatening East Taylor Municipal Authority Manager Ralph
Horner with jail if he did not return water service to an illegally
installed line on a property the judge owned.
   If convicted on all the charges, O'Kicki faces up to 38 years in
prison and $85,000 in fines. If acquitted, O'Kicki said he expected
to be reinstated to the bench.
   The state Supreme Court suspended O'Kicki in October 1988. He
was indicted in March.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old guard Communists lost their
last important jobs Tuesday, and the argument over whether Vaclav
Havel will crown the peaceful revolution by becoming president
moved into Parliament.
   The presidential contest is the last round for an opposition
that transformed Czechoslovakia in three weeks from a rigid
Communist state to a society in which the party is giving up power
for the first time in 41 years.
   Central Prague was plastered with posters for Havel, an
often-jailed playwright whose works were banned until the
revolution began. About 500 people stood outside Parliament,
shouting his name, as deputies entered.
   Parliament has until Dec. 23 to elect a president, under the
constitution, but some legislators want the choice to be made in a
referendum of all citizens.
   After discussions by constitutional lawyers from all parties,
Politburo member Vasil Mohorita said it might take up to 60 days
for an election to be held, whether in Parliament or by referendum.
   He said Havel, who leads the Civic Forum opposition group,
``represents something and in no way can we underestimate his
position in society.''
   Mohorita said the opposition agreed 14 days was too little time
for electing a president and ``what we are trying to find is the
least complicated agreement.'' Civic Forum said it opposes a
referendum.
   The new president will succeed Gustav Husak, 76, who resigned
Sunday after swearing in a coalition government intended to
overturn his hard-line policies and arrange free elections.
Mohorita represented the party in negotiations for the coalition.
   Several members of the new government were jailed or forced to
take lowly jobs when Husak became Communist Party chief after a
Soviet-led invasion ended the ``Prague Spring'' of reform in 1968.
   Other remaining hard-liners were swept out Tuesday, forced to
resign from the Presidium that guides Parliament. The 15 who
stepped down include ousted party chief Milos Jakes, who was
expelled from party last week, and Vasil Bilak, the man held most
responsible for the invasion. They remain as deputies.
   Anton Blazej, a deputy speaking for the Communists who dominate
the 350-seat Parliament, proposed Tuesday that the constitution be
amended to allow a citizen referendum for president, to be held
within a month.
   His suggestion was applauded loudly in the televised session. He
could not muster enough support to pass the necessary
constitutional amendments by acclamation, however, and acting
Speaker Bohuslav Kucera said draft laws must be submitted.
   A deputy who did not identify himself spoke in favor of Havel's
candidacy and earned warm applause from the crowded visitors'
gallery.
   Civic Forum, which Havel guided through the period of crisis and
change, said a referendum might seem ``enticingly democratic,'' but
a presidential campaign could leave Czechoslovakia ``more divided
than united.''
   A Civic Forum statement said the president should be elected by
Parliament, as in the past, while the government presses on with
plans for free elections.
   Lubos Dobrovsky, a spokesman, read the statement to reporters,
then said in response to a question: ``We are not concerned with
whether Havel would have a better chance'' of election in
Parliament than in a referendum. ``We are concerned with democracy
having a better chance.''
   Last week, Civic Forum indicated virtual agreement among parties
that the president should be a Czech non-Communist because the new
premier is Marian Calfa, a Communist from Slovakia. The tradition
is for a Czech to hold one of the top jobs and a Slovak the other.
   Havel is a controversial choice for Communists who were
denouncing him only a month ago.
   Alexander Dubcek, a 68-year-old Slovak who led the 1968 reforms
as party chief, also is a candidate for president and got the
support Tuesday of the Slovak National Council, Slovakia's regional
parliament.
   Other candidates are Ladislav Adamec, the Communist premier who
resigned last week, and Cestmir Cisar, a ``Prague Spring'' leader
who was expelled from the party with Dubcek in 1970.
   Calfa said Sunday a Czech premier could be found if the
president was a Slovak.
   Although the Communists are wary of Havel, they know more unrest
could result if he is not elected. Dobrovsky told reporters no
decision had been made about organizing more protests or strikes if
Havel passed over.
   Bilak was charged Monday with two unspecified counts connected
with the 1968 crackdown. The official news agency CTK gave no
details, but said he was believed in some quarters to have
committed treason.
   The 72-year-old former party ideologist apparently cannot be
tried because the crimes with which he is charged fall under a
20-year statute of limitations.
   On Tuesday, Bilak was attacked in the Communist Party daily of
his native Slovakia for bringing ``shame on the party'' by buying a
villa for one-tenth what the government had spent to renovate it.
   Jibes like that used to be aimed only at dissidents.

<TEXT>
   Four nuclear submarine commanders have been
replaced this year over leadership difficulties, according to a
Navy spokeswoman.
   Two of the commanders, including USS Houston commanding officer
John H. Sohl III, were relieved for cause, a formal procedure that
can bar future sea command.
   Sohl was relieved of his command Friday and given a punitive
letter of reprimand after his submarine cut its towed sonar cable
while attempting to avoid striking an obstacle, Lt. Susan Haeg said
Monday.
   Sohl also was aboard the submarine when it snagged the tow cable
of a civilian tug off Long Beach in May. One of the tug's three
crew members died.
   Also relieved from his post was Cmdr. John C. Bickford,
commanding officer of the Gurnard. The submarine ran aground off
San Diego in May.
   The commanders of two other nuclear-powered attack submarines
were transferred to other duties ahead of schedule because of poor
performance, Rear Adm. David Oliver said Monday.
   He would not name them because the action had not involved
punishment.
   Oliver reached his decision on Bickford after reviewing the
Gurnard's grounding. He also relieved the quartermaster who was on
duty at the time, but would not identify the sailor.
   The Houston was involved in incidents almost monthly starting in
May, including the sinking of the tug Barcona, a flooding incident,
a small fire and an incident with a torpedo.
   Besides the high number of command changes during his command of
Submarine Group 5, Oliver said he has formally requested that
navigation teams assigned to nuclear submarines undergo a thorough
overhaul of duties and personnel.
   Oliver said his reorganization proposal includes the removal of
certain types of enlisted sailors from submarine navigation teams
and new methods for keeping the vessels safe from navigation
dangers.

   A strike by gasoline retailers closed
most filling stations across this Caribbean nation for the second
day Tuesday, causing long lines at the few stations open and a drop
in student and worker attendance.
   The Jamaica Gasoline Retailers' Association and the government
are at odds over paying retroactive profit margin increases of four
cents a gallon.
   Gasoline costs $1.67 a gallon here.
   Energy Minister Hugh Small said the strike would harm the winter

   The remains of revolutionary priest Henri Gregoire
were enshrined in the Pantheon Tuesday along with those of a
philosopher and a mathematician in the last official event of
France's bicentennial year.
   President Francois Mitterrand attended the ceremony in the
former Left Bank church where France honors its heros, but the
event was boycotted by French church leaders who feel the priest
was something less than a hero.
   The priest, better known as Abbe Gregoire, was known for his
fight against slavery, but he also proposed the abolition of the
monarchy and backed a controversial oath to the state that the
clergy were forced to take.
   Moved to the Pantheon at the same time were Jean-Antoine
Caritat, Marquis de Concorcet, a friend of Voltaire and other
philosophers; and Gaspard Monge, inventor of descriptive geometry.
Both were active in the French revolution.
   Pope John Paul II was represented by the papal nuncio, Lorenzo
Antonetti.
   The French church has not forgotten the revolution's massacres
of priests and desecration of churches.
   ``The Abbe Gregoire defended a conception of the church which
differs from the Catholic tradition,'' Cardinal Jean-Marie
Lustiger, archbishop of Paris, said in a newspaper interview before
the ceremony.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Favors Legalizing Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal drugs from cocaine to heroin should be
legalized, taxed and dispensed by the state because the so-called
war on drugs is failing, a federal judge said Tuesday.
   ``I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease
treating indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime,'' U.S. District
Judge Robert W. Sweet said in remarks to be delivered Tuesday
evening before the Cosmopolitan Club, a social club for women and
men.
   The result ``would be the elimination of the profit motive, the
gangs, the drug dealers,'' Sweet said. ``Obviously, the model is
the repeal of Prohibition and the end of Al Capone and Dutch
Schultz.''
   Sweet, a trial judge in the Southern District of New York for
more than 11 years, was the first federal judge to propose publicly
that illegal drugs be legalized, according to the Drug Policy
Foundation.
   The foundation, an international, non-profit research group in
Washington, is dedicated to finding alternatives to current drug
policy.
   Sweet said the current effort to stem the drug epidemic by
putting more people in jail is not working.
   ``The war on drugs has failed to stop the traffic, or to alter
the social patterns which produce the phenomena,'' he said. ``It is
expensive and diverting, and has come close to causing foreign
excursions, subversions and has caused us to reconsider whether or
not as a nation we wish to employ assassination as an expression of
policy.''
   Sweet's remarks came a day after federal drug czar William J.
Bennett made a speech charging that liberal intellectuals are
betraying their concern for the poor by advancing ``morally
scandalous'' arguments for repeal of drug laws.
   Sweet, a former federal prosecutor and a deputy mayor under
Republican Mayor John Lindsay, is part of a small but growing
chorus of public figures advocating drug legalization or
decriminalization.
   Despite Bennett's contention, they come from both the liberal
and conservative ends of the political spectrum and include former
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke,
economist Milton Friedman and political commentator William F.
Buckley.
   Sweet said he believes the root cause of the drug epidemic is
poverty, and drug dealing will continue to attract some elements of
the poor as long as the profit potential is so high.
   ``Perhaps we must ask not what can we do to eliminate drugs, but
what can we do to eliminate or at least reduce the level of
poverty,'' he said.
   Sweet proposed that pharmaceutical companies could manufacture
the drugs; the state would control prices and distribute them to
addicts for less than they currently cost; and that some of the tax
revenue would be plowed back into research, education and treatment
of addiction.
   Distribution to minors should remain prohibited, and users would
be identified through their DNA or fingerprints, Sweet said.
   In a telephone interview Monday, Sweet said he came to the
conclusion that drugs should be legalized from his personal
experience, without any discussion among colleagues.
   ``I just got into this because somebody asked me to make a
speech and I decided I would make the speech and in order to make
the speech I had to decide what I thought,'' he said. ``And that's
what I thought. I really haven't been conducting a survey or
anything like that.''

   Four French naval vessels that make up the special
evacuation force for the Comoros left France's Indian Ocean port of
Mayotte early Wednesday for an unknown destination, Agence
France-Presse reported.
   The French assembled the vessels and a force of about 800
sailors and soldiers to evacuate the 1,600 French citizens who live
in the Comoros if necessary.
   President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane of the Comoros was
assassinated on Nov. 26. Since then, the archipelago off East
Africa has been under the control of the 600-man presidential
guard, led by French mercenary Bob Denard and about 30 Europeans.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Monday that
France, the former colonial power, had no intention of intervening
militarily in the Comoros, but was preparing for any eventuality.
   Wednesday's sailing clearly was aimed at putting pressure on
Denard and his men. Both France and South Africa, the countries
providing the largest amount of aid to the islands, have cut off
all aid to the Comoros until Denard leaves. Denard has denied
involvement in the assassination.
   The naval group included the supply ship Marne, serving as
flagship; the escort vessel Protet; the light supply vessel La
Grandiere, and the destroyer La Boudeuse, the French news agency
said. It quoted a French military spokesman in Mayotte as saying
the ships left there at 4 a.m. (8 p.m. EST Wednesday).
   Mayotte is in the Comoro chain but is administered by France.
   The spokesman, Col. Philippe Charrier, did not reveal the
mission of the military force.
   AFP quoted military sources in Mayotte as saying the force would
anchor about 45 miles off Grande Comore island, site of the
archipelago's capital, Moroni.
   It was Denard who installed Abdallah in power in a 1978 coup,
and who has been a force in the Comoros ever since.
   The French news agency said France, working with South Africa,
has opened discreet negotiations with the French mercenary to
obtain his departure.
   Denard hinted at a news conference Tuesday night that he would
leave the Comoros, saying he could not ``resist two superpowers,''
referring to France and South Africa. He said Abderrahmane was
killed accidentally by his bodyguard, a Sgt. Jaffar.
   The conservative newspaper Le Figaro reported Tuesday that the
60-year-old Denard said he and his men will be happy to leave the
Comoros if the price is right and the arrangements are honorable.
   Since the assassination, Justice Said Mohammed Djohar of the
Supreme Court has been acting president. He has made no public
appeal for French aid to drive out Denard and his men.

   The American premiere of ``Episodes'' by the
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on Tuesday was total excitement
_ fast, violent movement and embraces that last a second before the
partipants saunter away.
   Ulysses Dove, former dancer in the company, who made his
choreographic debut with the company in 1979, choreographed
``Episodes.'' It was originally performed by the London Festival
Ballet and Ballet Francais de Nancy. Dove rechoreographed it for
the Ailey dancers.
   The original score is by Robert Ruggieri. It is full of
explosive percussion and references to ``musique concrete.''
Dancers are dressed sexy, men in black, bare-shoulder leotards,
women in short black skirts, bare legs and feet, hair flying around.
   Sometimes the four women look like Tina Turner in full concert
frenzy. Sometimes the five men look like advertisements for muscled
shoulders and arms.
   ``Episodes'' begins with two men exploding onto the stage,
jumping in, then whirling, to crashes of drums. A woman jumps in,
caught by one of the men. When she stretches her palm toward his
face, he falls to the ground. A man decks a woman by touching his
hand on her shoulder. All the way through, violence is only
suggested.
   Images stay in the memory. As a man walks away after a brief
embrace, the woman twirls in front of him. He picks her up like a
sack of flour and hands her off to another man.
   Sometimes lighting by John B. Read, is semidark, other times
there are three circles of light for dancers to explore, other
times an X of light crosses the stage.
   There are episodes in ``Episodes'' when hands are held like
fists but it seems more tense than angry. There is one instance of
jealousy when a woman steps between a man and a woman approaching
him but generally ``Episodes'' is unemotional. Dove started it on a
high pitch and keeps it there. Dancers are lucky there are nine so
two or three can run, change direction and dart forward while the
others, presumably, are panting in the wings.
   It certainly is exciting.
   Dancers were Renee Robinson, Elizabeth Roxas, Neisha Folkes,
Debora Chase, Desmond Richardson, Stephen Smith, Dwight Rhoden,
Wesley Johnson III and Dereque Whiturs.
   The evening began with ``Landscape,'' which Ailey choreographed
in 1981 to Bela Bartok's ``Piano Concerto No. 3,'' and ended with
George Faison's 1971 ``Suite Otis,'' danced to recordings by Otis
Redding.
   The company is at the City Center through Dec. 31.

   A drug summit to be attended by
President Bush and the leaders of the three major Latin American
drug-producing countries will take place next February in
Cartagena, Colombia, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   An advance team left Washington late Monday to prepare for the
meeting.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, told a news conference in this capital that the U.S.
government had accepted Cartagena as the summit site.
   President Virgilio Barco had suggested the Caribbean port 680
miles north of Bogota as the meeting place despite U.S. concerns
over security.
   Presidents Barco, Bush, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan
Garcia of Peru will attend the summit.
   Ever since Barco declared an anti-narcotics war after a leading
presidential candidate was assassinated on Aug. 18, Colombia has
undergone a wave of killings, including a bombing last week that
claimed 63 lives.
   Officials also blame drug barons for the bombing of a Colombian
jetliner on a domestic flight Nov. 27 that killed all 107 people
aboard.
   Aronson, speaking to reporters at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Thomas McNamara, confirmed the summit would take place
in February but said he could not give exact date, adding that the
Barco administration would have to set it.
   Bush has repeatedly praised the efforts of the Barco government
to fight the drug lords in the face of all-out violence.
   Colombia, Peru and Bolivia all receive U.S. aid that is tied to
the progress of their anti-drug efforts.
   The Bush administration would like to see more done to provide
economic alternatives to farmers whose lives depend on the coca
crop.
   The drug summit is expected to discuss crop substitution, U.S.
aid, and cooperation in the fields of money-laundering,
intelligence and extradition.
   The State Department reported to Congress last July that
negligible progress had been made in reducing coca production
despite spending of $100 million over 17 years. Production
increased every year, the department said.
   The office of William Bennett, director of the U.S. Office of
National Drug Control Policy, estimates 1988 coca production at 275
tons in Peru, 176 tons in Bolivia and 54 tons in Colombia, whose
drug traffickers process the crop grown in the other two countries.

   Many of the 27 children and adults killed
in a fiery bus crash could have survived if their seats had been
fire resistant and the bus's fuel tank had been improved, defense
witnesses testified Tuesday.
   Safety issues dominated the 13th day of testimony in the murder
and drunken-driving trial of Larry Mahoney, driver of the pickup
truck that collided head-on with the church bus south of this Ohio
River town on May 14, 1988.
   Eugene Sober, a fire safety engineer with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the 1977 Ford bus' seat
cushions and covers burn rapidly and emit toxic smoke that kill
passengers within minutes.
   Thomas Feaheny, a former Ford Motor Co. vice president,
testified that existing technology could have prevented the fire,
but was not allowed to give any details.
   Feaheny also testified that a protective cage around the bus'
gasoline tank probably would not have prevented the blaze.
   Carroll Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite has ruled that any
information about technology that could have prevented the bus fire
is inadmissable in the trial.
   ``Anytime there is evidence that has been excluded, obviously it
hurts us,'' defense attorney Russell Baldani said in an afternoon
press conference.
   Sober's testimony dealt with the deadly effects of flexible
polyurethane foam, the material in the cushions, and
polychlorinated vinyl, the plastic seat covering.
   ``Flexible polyurethane foam is the single largest class of
fuels involved with fatal fires,'' Sober said.
   When burned, untreated foam emits hydrogen cyanide gas and the
plastic emits hydrogen chloride gas, he said. In addition, the fire
produces carbon monoxide gas, forcing people to breathe harder and
faster.
   Sober said the fire hazards of the material used for the seats
were well known in the early 1970s.
   Foam treated with fire retardant was readily available to the
automotive industry when the school bus, later sold to the Radcliff
First Assembly of God church as surplus, was manufactured in 1977,
he said.
   Seats treated with fire retardant would have saved lives in the
crash, he said. ``There would have certainly been a lot more time
for them to escape,'' Sober said.
   Feaheny, a 26-year Ford employee, said the crash was ``the worst
single tragedy I ever heard of in the industry and it could have
been prevented.''
   He said a fire beneath the bus boiled gasoline in the metal fuel
tank ``like a teakettle'' and squirted flaming gasoline into the
bus ``like a flame thrower.''
   Under cross-examination, Feaheny said that while he never had
any direct involvement in the design and development of buses at
Ford, his overall experience in the mechanical systems of trucks
and cars provided him the basis to discuss the fuel tank safety of
the 1977 Ford bus.
   Feaheny, fired in September 1983, had sued six Ford executives
for about $30 million in damages, alleging they interfered with his
career development. A verdict in the suit went against Feaheny in
December 1986 and is on appeal.
   Baldani asked Feaheny if he had ``an ax to grind'' with Ford.
Feaheny said he did not.
   Mahoney's defense is expected to conclude Friday. He is charged
with 27 counts of murder, 12 counts of assault, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment and a count of drunken driving.

   A federal appeals court, ruling on the
landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case, said in a revised
version of an earlier opinion that this city hasn't done enough to
desegregate its schools.
   In the ruling reached Monday and released Tuesday, a three-judge
panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed
U.S. District Richard Rogers' decision in the case and sent it back
to the lower court.
   The original case led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1954
which set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and
busing cases. But black schoolchildrens' parents sued 10 years ago
to have the case reopened.
   The 94-page majority opinion, a reworked version of a 2-1
decision last June, was accompanied by a new, 154-page dissenting
opinion that said ``substantial integration'' had been achieved in
Topeka.
   Attorneys on both sides of the case were reluctant to comment on
the decision because they had not seen it yet.
   An attorney for the Topeka school board, Joe Zima, said the
board plans to hold an emergency meeting early next week to discuss
the case and consider the next step.
   In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated school systems
were unconstitutional because separate facilities for blacks and
whites provided inherently unequal educational opportunities.
   The Topeka school district, which had set aside four elementary
schools for blacks, was ordered to put an integration plan into
effect.
   In 1979, the parents of 16 black schoolchildren sued, saying the
district had not yet eliminated all vestiges of segregation.
   Rogers ruled in 1987 that the schools were not responsible for
lingering segregation because the board of education did not intend
to keep them segregated.
   In Monday's majority decision, Judge Stephanie Seymour wrote
that the schol district needed to do more to obtain integration.
   She said that about one-fourth of Topeka's minority elementary
school pupils still attend three schools with more than 50 percent
minority enrollments.
   ``We simply see no evidence that Topeka dedicated itself to
desegregation prior to the reopening of this case,'' Seymour wrote.
   Seymour said Rogers erred by limiting the district to having to
show it acted as it did for non-discriminatory reasons.
   ``As 30 years of desegregation law have made clear, the
Constitution requires more than ceasing to promote segregation,''
she wrote.
   The opinion was also signed by Judge Monroe McKay.
   In his dissenting opinion, Judge Bobby Baldock argued, ``The
school board has demonstrated concern for improving the racial
composition in the Topeka schools while retaining the neighborhood
school concept.
   ``In some places the two are not compatible, but in this system
substantial integration has been achieved.''
   Plaintiffs' attorney Rich Jones said the dissenting opinion
would be important because it would help the district decide what
to do.
   Zima said the district could ask all 10 judges on the appeals
court to hear the case, ask the Supreme Court to hear the case or
go before Rogers to help fashion a remedy for the problems cited by
the appellate court.

   Despite criticism of Romania's policies, U.S.
officials say they will send weapons-grade uranium to the hard-line
East Bloc country as soon as it comes up with a suitable way to
ship the material.
   Opponents of the sale, which was approved in 1988, call it
``crazy'' and say Romania can't be trusted with the dangerous
material. The 16.4 kilograms of uranium are slated to be used at
the Triga research reactor near Bucharest.
   ``In light of the Romanians' increasing isolation and
instability, this is not the time to be sending Romania the means

nuclear proliferation.

The case was surrounded by tight security ordered from Washington,

who traffic in drugs,'' the White House said in a statement.

<HEAD>USA Network Airs Frederick Forsyth Thriller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sudden attack of democracy in Eastern Europe
probably has ruined things for spy novelists who may now have to
come in from the Cold War. But the better ones still can make do.
   Exhibit A: Frederick Forsyth and his ``Just Another Secret.''
It's a tale he wrote as the basis for a two-hour USA Network movie
that the cable network has on display tonight and again on Sunday.
   Starring Beau Bridges as a CIA agent sent to East Germany after
a five-man CIA cell there mysteriously vanishes, it's a crisp,
workmanlike exercise in spying, amour, double- and triple-agenting,
blackmail and even betrayal.
   In the script by Murray Smith, our hero, probing the mystery of
the missing cell, comes across a plot by hard-line Stalinists. They
intend to assassinate Mikhail S. Gorbachev in East Germany during a
secret trip there by the Soviet leader.
   The United States, of course, will be blamed and, as one British
agent says, ``it could send the Cold War right back to the Ice
Age.'' Or, Bridges snaps, ``it could start a hot war.''
   The story's time, Forsyth explains in a preface, is ``just
before the Gorbachev-inspired reforms, when the Berlin Wall really
was impregnable and East Germany was a hard-line fortress under the
heel of the secret police.''
   Having asked you to forget current events, which are no fun for
espionage freaks, anyway, his show gets cracking immediately in the
best twist-and-turn tradition with its fine, predominantly British
cast.
   Ace spy Bridges, of course, is exhausted from a recent trip into
murky Beirut. Relaxing with his wife and kids at a barbeque at his
suburban Virginia home, he tries to get out of the missing-cell
mission. Sure.
   Next stop: East Berlin. He goes there disguised as a flutist in
a West German chamber music ensemble, swaps identities with a
stagehand, then has to kill a drunken cop, lest he be exposed.
   This touches off a hunt by an honest, dogged police lieutenant
(Kenneth Cranham) who thinks this only is a murder case.
   With the cops in hot pursuit, Bridges meets a lovely woman
(Beatie Edney), an artist-waitress who gives him a place to stay.
She readily _ too readily, cynics might say _ believes his tale
that he's a musician down on his luck.
   For some reason, he suspects she's an agent for the bad guys. Is
she? Or is she a Western snoop? Only her spymaster knows. But if
you don't think she and the Yank won't make love, you probably
believe in the tooth fairy.
   There also is a key figure, a cipher clerk (Erich Hallhuber) for
the East German Security Service. He's a homosexual whom Bridges
has been told is ripe for ``burning,'' or blackmail.
   The burning, part of Bridges' search for the missing agents, is
done and proves a turning point. It leads to his discovery of the
assassination plot in which the missing agents will ... ah, but
we've said too much already, as they are wont to say in The Agency.
   Now, the problem is how Bridges can sound a warning in a world
of perfidy.
   It's a tough problem made tougher by the traditional clash of
British and American spy agencies and agents that also occurs here.
   But something must be done to foil the sinister, hard-eyed,
high-level Soviet and East German plotters who call Gorbachev a
``traitor.'' It's fun watching the doing.
   It must be said that ``Just Another Secret,'' filmed in
Yugoslavia and the first in a series of Forsyth stories to be
filmed for the USA Network, is no ``Day of the Jackal.'' There are
no great surprises, no razor-edge tensions.
   But it's a well-done, fast-paced effort, akin to a good read on
a quiet day. You suspect you know how it'll come out, but you don't
mind.

<HEAD>Holidays Seen Spurring Schools To Teach About Religion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   If your public school is wondering how to observe coming
religious holidays without getting tangled in church-state issues,
a broad coalition of experts offers some tips.
   The key advice is that religious holidays present a special
opportunity for schools to do something they've generally neglected
_ to teach about religions, but not to celebrate them.
   Information about them, on which a severe educational gap lately
has been recognized, may focus on their origins, histories, how
they're observed and their meanings, the guidelines say, adding:
   ``If the approach is objective and sensitive, neither promoting
nor inhibiting religion, this study can foster understanding and
mutual respect for differences in belief.''
   The guidelines, called ``Religious Holidays In The Public
Schools: Questions and Answers,'' was produced by representatives
of l6 religious and educational groups embracing conservatives and
liberals rarely in accord.
   Charles C. Haynes, director of the Americans United Research
Foundation in Silver Spring, Md., and former professor of world
religions, sparked academic, interfaith effort.
   ``If public schools are going to survive, they're going to have
to find an appropriate place for religion in the functioning of the
schools,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``Without it, public education is going to suffer and be torn
apart.''
   Concerning numerous recent studies that have shown general
disregard of religion in public schools and in textbooks and
widespread ignorance of religion, he said:
   ``In many schools fear of controversy has led to silence about
religion. The irony is that silence about it has led to more
controversy and division. It's not approppriate simply to remove
religion.
   ``Evidence is that the proper role of religion in school begins
to restore faith in the public schools.''
   However, that role is not religious advocacy or devotions in
schools, but the extension of knowledge about religions and
understanding of their ideas and practices, the guidelines
emphasize.
   They say that this month with Christians celebrating Christmas
and Jews celebrating Hanukkah, it would ``be unrealistic'' to ban
all seasonal activities, but they should focus on educational
purposes ``for all students.''
   ``Holiday concerts may appropriately include music related to
Christmas and Hanukkah, but religious music should not dominate,''
the pamplet says, advocating a mix of non-religious holiday music
with the religious.
   ``Any dramatic productions should emphasize cultural aspects of
the holidays. Nativity pageants or plays portraying the Hanukkah
miracle are not appropriate in the public school setting.''
   ``It's important that the approach be broad,'' Haynes said,
``but to exclude traditional carols would be absurd. We should not
be afraid for students to be exposed to this sort of music.''
   Demands for the pamphlet, turned out in October, exhausted the
initial 75,000 printing, and another 50,000 is being printed by the
foundation, part of the broad coalition producing the document.
   It was a follow-up to another how-to brochure turned out by the
coalition in mid-1988 on ways to teach about religion in public
schools, something urged by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962-63 when
it banned devotionals there.
   Demand for that first pamphlet has passed the 200,000-mark, and
further printings have been ordered.
   Haynes, who left his post at Randolph-Macon College six years
ago to work on restoring teaching about religion to public
education, said, ``The school people are so grateful that this
problem is getting attention.''
   He said that banning the subject has ``marginalized religion''
and students ``get the same message from television and elsewhere,
that religion is funny and marginal,'' although it's the ``center
of life'' to most people.
   In a more religiously pluralistic society, he said schools must
become a place where a student's religion, whatever it is or none,
``is respected and understood and where he can learn what other's
believe.''
   ``You just can't leave it at the school house door,'' Haynes
added. ``Somehow it's got to be acknowledged, talked about and
recognized.''
   He said religious illiteracy has grown through school avoidance
of the subject, causing difficulties in ``how we live with each
other.''
   Religion ``plays a central role in the lives of people
throughout the world, but we're not preparing people to deal with
that reality. The potential for divisions is tremendous.''
   If religion is included educationlly, he said, it can relieve
intergroup pressures and ``can do a lot to create a climate that is
more inclusive for dealing with other issues.''
   With growing academic recognition of the unsound educational
effects of simply shunning religion, he said steps are being taken
to remedy the situation.
   Texbooks are being revised to include more about religion, and
teacher institutes are being held to equip teachers for handling
the subject, Haynes said. ``The change is happening a lot more
rapidly than I anticipated.''

<HEAD>Caught Between Roseanne and Meryl</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: `She-Devil' opens Dec. 18.</HEAD>

   When Ed Begley Jr.'s manager first suggested
the actor was being considered to co-star in a comedy with Meryl
Streep and Roseanne Barr, Begley was dubious.
   The calls continued over the weeks, and Begley remained
skeptical. When a script was reported imminent, he told his
manager: ``Good. You know, I've got that little letter hole in my
door. You put the script right through that little slot when you
get it.''
   To Begley's astonishment, the script of ``She-Devil'' arrived
from Orion Pictures.
   ``One day I was set to do a videotape here in L.A. It was sent
to (director) Susan Seidelman in New York. She apparently liked it
and sent it to Meryl; she liked it. Then I met with Susan Seidelman
and I liked her and she liked me. The next thing I know, I was
working on the picture,'' he recalled.
   Begley was cast as an ambitious accountant who leaves his
slovenly wife (Barr) for the self-enchanted author of romance
novels (Streep). Barr then becomes the title role, cooking up
diabolical plots as revenge on her faithless husband and his
willful temptress.
   Thus Begley appears throughout the film with both stars, who
meet only briefly. Critics have marveled at Streep's facility for
comedy, heretofore hidden on the screen behind accents and heavy
dramatics.
   ``She's done great comedy work over the years on the New York
stage and Yale Drama School and what have you,'' observed the
lanky, straw-haired actor. ``People who were fortunate enough to
see that know her well in the world of comedy. She'll do more;
she's great. I don't think there's anything she can't do.''
   Begley said her comedy often broke him up on the set, ``but I
got my revenge: I beat her at Scrabble. Often.''
   About Roseanne Barr: ``It was her first motion picture, and she
was wonderful to work with. I think she did a terrific job and
hopefully she'll do more. She certainly has conquered the world of
television. You can't do any better than she's done, going against
a show like Cosby (`The Cosby Show') and doing well.
   ``I've seen the show quite a bit. It's consistently funny and
insightful, I think. If I do television again, I'd like to do
that.''
   Until ``She-Devil,'' Begley was best known as the smart-talking
Dr. Victor Ehrlich on ``St. Elsewhere,'' which brought him Emmy
nominations during each of its six seasons on NBC. He has also
played character roles in films such as ``The In-laws'' with Peter
Falk and Alan Arkin, ``The Accidental Tourist'' with William Hurt
and Geena Davis and ``Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly
Hills'' with Jacqueline Bisset.
   Begley grew up in the San Fernando Valley during his father's
heyday as a top character actor in films (Academy Award, supporting
actor, ``Sweet Bird of Youth,'' 1962). Begley Sr. made no attempt
to influence his son's choice of career, but the boy knew at age 10
that he wanted to act.
   ``I knew what it was, going in,'' he remarked in an interview.
``I knew there would be autographs requested; I knew everything
that went with it. I don't have the excuse that some actors
legitimately have: `I didn't bargain on this (notoriety); I just
want to do my best work as an actor.'
   ``I can't make that claim. I knew what it was, because I saw my
father go through it. We had a hard time getting from Point A to
Point B at Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm or wherever we went
together. I knew if I did (become an actor), there was a
possibility of that happening. Now my kids have to suffer through
long lines going through an airport with people wanting autographs,
etc.
   ``But it's part of the job. People are very friendly and nice.''
   Begley started acting at 17 in ``My Three Sons'' and turned up
on other series such as ``Room 222,'' ``Happy Days'' and ``The
Doris Day Show.'' For a few years he worked in stand-up comedy,
first with a partner, then as a single. He recalls the work as
great experience but sometimes devastating.
   ``I remember one night I was opening for John Sebastian, Loggins
and Messina and Poco at Nassau Coliseum in New York, 18,000
people,'' he said with a shudder. ``I had the most incredibly great
reaction when I first went out. I did an opening bit in a police
uniform that always went well with college crowds. Big applause,
laughter, the whole thing.
   ``About 10 minutes into it, I started to lose them. I had these
hand props, 11 by 14 photographs that were usually large enough for
big audiences. But past the 10th row, they couldn't see a damn
thing. They started to lose interest, and they began to go `Po-co,
Po-co.' An angry mob _ I think they were ready to say, `Give us
Barabbas next.'
   ``Soon after, I decided to go back to television and films.''

<HEAD>Sociologist: Social Issues No Match For Salvation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vietnam War and civil rights have proved no
match for heaven and hell in keeping mainline Protestants in the
pews, according to a sociologist studying the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).
   Benton Johnson of the University of Oregon, who recently
completed one study of the church and is in the middle of another,
said that as the concept of personal salvation was ridiculed by
secular intellectual culture, mainline churches turned to social
issues to revitalize their denominations.
   But activism on issues such as civil rights and the Vietnam War
has been ``a carrot without a stick,'' leaving a generation of
mainline Protestants with few compelling reasons for belonging to a
church and evangelism programs with limited chances of success, he
said.
   ``The problems may be really formidable,'' Johnson said. ``You
have to have a good rap. I don't know what the Presbyterians are
prepared to say with a straight face that they all agree on.''
   Johnson recently set forth his theory on ``Leaving Church:
Religious Diversity and Change'' at the annual meeting of the
American Academy of Religion in Anaheim, Calif.
   In an interview, Johnson discussed his findings from a recently
completed study of Presbyterian General Assembly announcements on
social issues in the 20th century and from preliminary research in
a study of Presbyterians who were confirmed in the 1960s that he is
doing with Dean R. Hoge of the Catholic University of America and
Donald R. Luidens of Hope College.
   Hoge said early results in the research project, which is
expected to be finished in 1991, show that only about 55 percent of
the Presbyterians confirmed in the 1960s are still active in
churches.
   The Presbyterian Church, which adopted evangelism and church
development as its two priority goals at its 1989 General Assembly,
lost more than a quarter of its members from 1970 to 1987, losing
more than a million people and falling to less than 3 million
members.
   While it is still early to draw definitive conculsions on the
membership decline, Johnson said, the roots of the denomination's
current status go back to the end of the 19th century when the idea
that individuals were predestined to either heaven or hell was
losing credibility among the intellectual classes.
   As the credibility of the religious tradition diminished, the
church lowered the ``costs'' of being a Presbyterian, Johnson said.
   ``By 1965, good Presbyterians watched Sunday football, left
religious education entirely to the Sunday school, practiced birth
control, drank martinis and went to movies,'' he said.
   The old agenda of Sabbath observance, temperance, strict rules
on divorce and birth control was replaced by a new agenda that
began with the Social Gospel movement in the 1890s, Johnson said.
   But while the new agenda was adopted wholeheartedly by church
leadership, it did not reach down into the pews, he said.
   ``If the good Presbyterians of 1965 who drank martinis and
watched football on Sundays had also been actively assisting
migrant workers or protesting U.S. involvement in Vietnam, the loss
of commitment to the denomination's old agenda would have been
offset by the generation of commitment to a new agenda,'' he said.
   Today, particularly faced with a New Age movement that preaches
against any concept of personal guilt and a decline of any notion
that salvation is a desperate necessity because hell is the only
alternative, many people raised in the church no longer see
sufficient benefits for membership, he said.
   While Presbyterians in earlier days stayed and changed the
church to adjust to cultural shifts, ``those born since the Second
World War have tended to cut and run,'' Johnson said.
   ``There's also probably the tendency _ the Cheshire cat's grin
so to speak _ of these people having a general negative attitude
toward Christianity, without knowing much about it.''
   From 1970 to 1987, the church's Sunday school attendance dropped
precipitously, from 1.9 million to 1.1 million.
   The Rev. James E. Andrews, the denomination's chief executive,
said a decline in religious education has been a major factor in
the church's losses.
   ``I think our biggest failure is the loss of our young people,''
said Andrews. ``We quit fertilizing our own garden.''
   Hoge, a Presbyterian, said research has shown a lack of
denominational loyalty among Presbyterians, many of whom would
switch to another mainline denomination ``without batting an eye.''
   ``There is definitely a lack of a clear Presbyterian identity,''
he said.
   But Hoge said it is still too early to draw conclusions about
ways to reverse the membership decline, or produce a Third Great
Awakening in American society. ``We don't even know the nature of
the disease,'' he said.
   Andrews said it is an oversimplification to blame the
denomination's losses on its social agenda.
   ``I would pay more attention not to the loss of the stick of
hellfire, but the failure of the carrot. ... That is, there is no
secular reward for spirituality,'' he said.

   A dissenting organization of Episcopal
traditionalists who oppose women's ordination, the Episcopal Synod
of America, has launched a drive to expand its ``recognized
theological position.''
   Recognition of that dissenting position came from the church's
House of Bishops bishops in September, and the new group's
president, Bishop Clarence Pope Jr. of Fort Worth, advised staying
``close friends'' with majority opponents.
   ``We share much with those with whom we disagree
fundamentally,'' he told the new synod's first legislative meeting,
which approved a $700,000 budget for 1990 and made plans to expand
its influence among congregations.
   ``If our mission is to prosper, we must confess our own
shortcomings and do all we can to work in any appropriate way with
those of the majority in the Episcopal Church while not
compromising our principles,'' Pope said.

   The widely distributed film
documentary ``Jesus'' has expanded into communist territory with a
premier last week in Soviet Georgia.
   Paul Eshleman of Campus Crusade for Christ said he hoped the new
showings would be ``an encouragement to the heart.''
   The documentary, based on the gospel of Luke, was filmed in the
Holy Land by the Genesis Project, which is engaged in a long-range
project to film the entire Bible, and by Campus Crusade.
   ``Jesus'' has been dubbed into more than 40 languages and seen
by more than 330 million people in 160 countries since it was
issued in 1979, its sponsors say.

   An interfaith organization says a growing trend
to blend symbols of Hanukkah and Christmas in greeting card art is
``an affront to Judaism, to Christianity and to serious interfaith
relations.''
   The National Conference of Christians and Jews and the American
Jewish Committee said in a joint statement that each celebration
``is totally distinct in origin and purpose'' and the distinctions
should be respected.
   ``Greeting cards that mingle Santas and Menorahs, angels, trees,
stockings and Stars of David are objectionable,'' the statement
added.

<TEXT>
   Alexander ``Junior'' Stevens traveled seven
miles across the Bronx every morning to Alfred E. Smith High
School, an all-boys vocational school with a reputation as a quiet
place, a ``safe'' school.
   ``Junior'' was shot to death outside the school cafeteria Nov.
14; a 15-year-old classmate was charged. The two were playing with
a .22-caliber pistol when it accidentally went off, police said.
   ``There are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kids
are sitting there with guns in their bookbags. They just haven't
decided to shoot yet,'' said Ed Muir, of the United Federation of
Teachers, the teachers union.
   ``Junior's'' was the first killing in a city school since 1978.
But in a system where violence is routine, it caused little uproar
among students.
   ``The thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kids
seem to be taking this so calmly. It's just another kid whacked,''
said Muir.
   Bruce Irushalmi, director of the Board of Education Office of
School Safety, said students ``bring guns to school because they
don't feel safe going to and from school. ... They say they need
them to create a balance of power.''
   Muir is more cynical. ``Some kids feel they actually need it for
protection, and some are businessmen who have large quantities of
cash and thought it the prudent thing not to apply for a pistol
permit.''
   From September 1988 to June 1989, 1,854 weapons were seized at
schools, ranging from razor-edged box cutters to automatic weapons.
At 15 schools where roving teams of security guards used metal
detectors, five guns and 815 other weapons were confiscated during
the 1988-1989 school year _ a year that saw 1,356 students
assaulted, 183 robbed, 78 sexually assaulted and 105 caught using
controlled substances. Figures for this year were unavailable.
   To balance the arms race, New York City spent $62 million on
security in 1988, about 1 percent of the $7 billion budget. Metal
detectors accounted for about $4 million of that; the rest
supported 2,450 uniformed, but unarmed, security guards who police
a system with just under a million students.
   ``If we were a police force, we would be the 10th largest police
force in the country,'' Irushalmi said.
   To Muir, it isn't enough. He cites the increase in gun incidents
_ twice a week last year, 19 in the first 34 school days of this
year _ as evidence that the city's schools are dangerous places to
be. Figures kept by his union show a 5 percent increase in crime
inside schools during the 1988-89 school year.
   Preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11 percent increase in
school crime in September, and Muir said 44 teachers were assaulted
during the first month of school this fall, compared to 27 during
September 1988.
   But Irushalmi, whose two children attend public schools, says
the problem is not inside the buildings. Reports of violence inside
schools have fallen from 15,000 a year in 1981 to 9,000 in 1988-89.
Outside is another story.
   ``For anyone under 18 this is Dodge City and you have to carry a
piece,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, we don't have Miss Kitty at the
Long Branch to make sure you check your piece at the door.''
   In one corner of this Dodge City, outside Prospect Heights High
School in Brooklyn, a student was shot on the very first day of
school.
   ``There's no safety in Prospect Heights,'' despite spot checks
with metal detectors, said Bob ``Brother'' Abu, 15. ``If they don't
come on Monday, they put the weapons in their lockers. So when the
weapon detectors come on Wednesday, they have their weapons in the
school already.''
   ``There ain't no safety,'' said his 17-year-old friend, who
identified himself as Carl, or Shrapnel Insepticon, a senior at
Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. He wore a blue bandana over
his lower face, Jesse James style, and said he was a member of the
Decepticons, a teen-age street gang named after evil characters in
``The Transformers,'' a cartoon show.
   The loosely knit gang, which has taken to bandanas as
identification, has been accused of taking part in Halloween
rampages on Manhattan's East Side, as well as in wolfpack-type
attacks on students at bus and subway stations.
   More than 100,000 students stayed away from school on Halloween,
apparently out of fear; more than 250 high school-age youths were
arrested as they roamed the city, robbing, intimidating and
assaulting pedestrians and merchants.
   Muir and the UFT have proposed some remedies: metal detectors in
every school, a police liaison for junior high schools, stiffer
penalties for anyone caught with guns. But these steps, all agree,
will not solve the underlying problems that lead to school violence.
   ``The schools are a mirror of society,'' Irushalmi said, citing
drugs and crime, the easy availability of weapons, ``the diminution
of values.''
   ``These kids don't distinguish between the schools and the
streets,'' Muir said. ``They don't see any difference.''
   ``We really think it's related to drugs. Part of it has to do
with the sales, but another part is a lot of the kid's parents are
using drugs, and the kids are acting out,'' said Gretchen Rausch,
an assistant commissioner of the Probation Department who began her
career as a probation officer in 1967.
   Arrests of kids ages 7 to 16 jumped 27 percent from 1987 to
1988, she said.
   But the kids say there is no simple reason why they prey upon
each other and their teachers.
   Sean Chittick, 17, is a senior at Murry Bergtraum High School,
located across from police headquarters and regarded by many as one
of the city's safer schools. Still, he sees violence all around
him, and he is mystified.
   ``It just be happening for no type of reason,'' he said. ``Now
they just be killing them for gold jewelry, or `You lookin' at my
girl.'''

   The 1980s was the decade of music videos on
television, boffo bucks for Hollywood, endless TV talk shows and an
entertainment hybrid called performance art. In a decade of few
artistic leaps, one original form did emerge: rap music. AP Arts
Editor Dolores Barclay takes a light look at the entertainment
world through the rhythm of rap, the beat of the '80s.

   In the movie business, the 1980s started off with a whisper and
ended with a cheer. In recent years, the American film industry has
enjoyed its greatest box-office success ever, closing the decade
with $5 billion in revenues in 1989. It was also a decade in which
independent filmmakers flourished and animated features returned to
the big screen.
   Here is an alphabetical list of 20 top movies of the '80s as
compiled by the editors of The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``AMADEUS'' _ A stunning, gorgeous-looking requiem for a child
prodigy, directed with style and ferocity by Milos Forman. As
Mozart, Tom Hulce displays wit and obsessiveness. F. Murray Abraham
gives a chilling performance as Antonio Salieri. The soundtrack is
superb.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``ATLANTIC CITY''@ _ The trumps are coming, the trumps are
coming. Burt Lancaster stars as an aging numbers runner, and Susan
Sarandon plays a struggling casino dealer in Louis Malle's vision

major developers. Grand performances and an exciting, witty script
by John Guare.
</TEXT>

ripping caper. A stunning suspense movie that combines all the
right elements _ style, mystery, surprise, music, the offbeat and
class _ to produce a winner. It also has an magnificent soundtrack.

has just about everything: It's funny, provocative, thoughtful, sad
and scary.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

Utterly and unselfconsciously charming. A lovely, offbeat little
comedy that sparkles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MY LIFE AS A DOG''@ _ Love, sex and death as seen through one
boy's penetrating eyes. None of the grief in this film kept anyone
from feeling better after walking out of the theater. It was so
popular that audiences cheered the trailer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS''@ _ Comedy, melodrama, tragedy,
vaudeville, plus the chaos of war _ and it's not even Shakespeare.
</TEXT>

filled with humor, sophistication, surprises, thrills. Great
cinematography and nice touches from Harrison Ford.

<TEXT>
``THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING''@ _ Kaufman does it again.

decade. A brilliant marriage of animation and live action and the
debut of Roger and Jessica.

between a trapeze artist and an angel, a story brought down to

with F. Scott Fitzgerald and, of course, wooing Mia Farrow. A
beautiful statement on identity and the Fickle Finger of Fame. An
ingenious blend of vintage newsreel footage and vintage Allen in

<HEAD>Top Fiction of the 1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The blockbuster novel, which crowded the bookshelves in the
1970s, faded in the 1980s, a time when publishers turned to small,
well-written gems and first-time authors.
   Here is an alphabetical list of 20 top works of fiction in the
'80s, as compiled by the editors of The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``AN ARTIST OF THE FLOATING WORLD,'' Kazuo Ishiguro@ _ An
imaginative tour de force built around that most British of
institutions, the butler.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``BELOVED,'' Toni Morrison@ _ Crimes and misdemeanors with the
   living made to die and the dead come to life. As always, she writes
with astonishing lyricism, the words seeming to float right off the
page.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,'' Tom Wolfe@ _ A dark, scathing,
riotous epic of nasty, neurotic New York.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``CATHEDRAL,'' Raymond Carver@ _ Grief and despair warmed by
forgiveness and the smell of fresh bread. Small words and big
truths. The peak comes with the short story ``A Small, Good
Thing,'' a deeply moving account of how death can divide and unite
at the same time.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``FLAUBERT'S PARROT,'' Julian Barnes@ _ A witty, meditative
journey of a man's obsession with his literary hero. It is part
fiction and part literary criticism but always compelling.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE FLOATING WORLD,'' Cynthia Kadohata@ _ Inspired by
Faulkner and Carver, the Americanization of a Japanese family. Only
her first novel, Kadohata is in complete control, her writing as
clear and even as a moonlit sky.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE HANDMAID'S TALE,'' Margaret Atwood@ _ Future shock;
outrageous acts and quiet rebellion. Atwood imagines the United
States after a right-wing takeover and uses wit, intelligence and
exhaustive research to turn nightmare into reality.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``HOUSEKEEPING,'' Marilynne Robinson@ _ A small gem about human
relationships. The language is precise and lyrical.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``IN COUNTRY,'' Bobbie Ann Mason@ _ A happy book about sad
things. As narrated by Kentucky teen-ager Sam Hughes, ``In
Country'' takes the most ordinary details _ shopping malls, used
cars, the radio _ and shows why they matter.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE JOY LUCK CLUB,'' Amy Tan@ _ A young Chinese-American
woman comes to grips with her mother's past in China and its impact
on her life. Beautiful, controlled language and always powerful.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``LONESOME DOVE,'' Larry McMurtry@ _ Dust and trust on two old
friends' last hurrah cattle drive. Written with gusto.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

obsession with a woman.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN,'' Salman Rushdie@ _ Surreal look at
   India through the life of a magic child born the instant India
became independent from Britain. A massive novel, written
aggressively.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE MOSQUITO COAST,'' Paul Theroux@ _ A boy's tale of
escaping from America aboard his father's paranoid genius.
Theroux's story is full of paradox, humor and energy. A sendup of
contemporary America, and yet a deadly serious commentary.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE NAME OF THE ROSE,'' Umberto Eco@ _ Story of the turmoil
of early Catholicism played through a murder mystery. A vastly
intellectual book that never loses its suspenseful steam.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``PERFUME,'' Patrick Susskind@ _ A pungent novel about an
odorless man. A literary tour de force that makes a freak a hero,
and speaks of the tragedy of loneliness.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``RABBIT IS RICH,'' John Updike@ _ Story of an aging Harry
Angstrom. A dazzling and fulfilling read.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``SIXTY STORIES,'' Donald Barthelme@ _ A book that presents 20
years of Barthelme's work, his journey to minimalism. It clearly
shows how and why he was such a major influence on the American
short story.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE SPORT OF NATURE,'' Nadine Gordimer@ _ A grand and richly
documented chronicle of post-colonialism. A powerful novel of
awakening from a powerful writer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``WORLD'S END,'' T. Coraghessan Boyle@ _ History, real and
imagined; fathers, lost and found, from Indians in the 17th century
through hippies in the 20th. A vastly satisfying work.

   Despite a rash of sleep-inducing talk shows, unimaginative
cable-TV programming and formula sitcoms, a few television
producers took risks in the 1980s and tried for something
above-average, daring, entertaining and intelligent.
   Here is an alphabetical list of 20 top television series and
miniseries, as compiled by the editors of The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``BRIDESHEAD REVISITED''@ _ An ambitious and thoroughly
rewarding 11-part adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel with a cast of
greats, including Jeremy Irons, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence
Olivier.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``CHEERS''@ _ A tightly produced ensemble sitcom starring Ted
Danson and Shelley Long that played for emotions as well as laughs.
Scripts stressed the human element, were adult and had
universality. The first two seasons were best.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE COSBY SHOW''@ _ A 1980s ``Father Knows Best'' in $1,000
sweaters. Intelligent and realistic scripts that stressed family
and human values.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``CRIME STORY''@ _ Michael Mann's not-necessarily-the-'60s
crime show, rippingly done in its first season. Though it followed
the ``Miami Vice'' formula, it was a hard-edged thriller.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF MOLLY DODD''@ _ It had a
self-conscious quality, but this show about a contemporary single
lass in the big city mirrored the hopes, fears, vulnerabilities and
fantasies of today's working woman. It was a sitcom with a
melodramatic underpinning.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE EQUALIZER''@ _ What a hero! A modern-day knight with a
state-of-the-art arsenal and a Jaguar. Intelligent, original
un-Hollywood scripts and good performances from veteran stage
actors kept this show in peak form.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``FAWLTY TOWERS''@ _ A British import starring John Cleese, it
was one of the wittiest, funniest sitcoms on TV during the decade.
Call it a comedy of anxiety, or high vaudeville. But call it funny.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``FRANK'S PLACE''@ _ Small is beautiful. Noo Awlins atmosphere
so t'ick ya kin smell da erstez, dollin'. A warm and intelligent
sitcom with the talented Tim Rice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``HILL STREET BLUES''@_ Pushed limits of sexuality and
language, but with fine writing and a solid ensemble cast.
Interesting and provocative scripts the first two seasons.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MAGNUM, P.I.''@ _ What otherwise would have been a routine
action series of stereotyped characters was saved by occasionally
brilliant writing and overall by the genial and unpretentious Tom
Selleck.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MIAMI VICE''@ _ The first seasons were the best. A fresh and
exciting action-police series that reaped the benefits of MTV.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MOONLIGHTING''@ _ The first two seasons set the pace for
stylish repartee between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. It was a
fast-paced comedy-action show that left a smile.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``MURPHY BROWN''@ _ Candice Bergen is a sight for sore eyes.
She has style, wit and charm and is a welcome relief from the
overpainted, overdressed, oversexed ladies in the Aaron Spelling
stable that seemed to dominate television in the '80s. Intelligent,
funny and timely scripts help make this a winner.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``NIGHT COURT''@ _ A sitcom with a bunch of pros. Bosom jokes.
Bottom jokes. But tasteful, yes? Million-dollar laughs from a great
ensemble.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``SCTV''@ _ Canadians do the best American comedy on
television. Fresh and original ``live'' comedy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE `SLAP' MAXWELL STORY''@ _ Viewers had to supply the laugh
track _ this was no Hollywood idiot show. A curmudgeon with a
heart; a show with a conscience.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY'' and ``SMILEY'S PEOPLE''^ _ The
Cold War was never chillier; Alec Guinness' masterwork as a master
spy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``A WALK THROUGH THE 20TH CENTURY''@ _ Bill Moyers' superb look
at the people and events that fashioned the century.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``WISE GUY''@ _ Only the first two seasons put this in the Top
20. Who will ever forget Sonny Steelgrave and Mel Profitt? A
crime-fighting series with a contemporary bite that took story
lines beyond drugs, prostitution and gambling into the record
industry, real estate, the garment industry and corporate America.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
``THE WONDER YEARS''@ _ A look at life through the eyes of a
kid. The show hits on a gut level _ it's emotional, funny, real.

<HEAD>Editors Vote: Gorbachev, Crumbling Walls Top the News of '80s</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In addition to its annual poll on the year's top
news stories, The AP this year surveyed news professionals on the
top stories of the decade of the 1980s. Here is a report on the
results.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By SID MOODY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the thawing of the Cold War were voted
the story of the 1980s by editors and news directors of member
newspapers and broadcast stations of The Associated Press.
   Other stories in the decade's top 10 were, in descending order:
the AIDS epidemic, Ronald Reagan's tax-cutting presidency, the U.S.
drug plague, explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the Iran
hostage crisis and other terrorist acts, the nuclear meltdown at
Chernobyl, China's suppression of its democracy movement, the
Iran-Contra affair, and continuing strife in Central America.
   The 306 editors responding to the poll gave 2,593 points to
Gorbachev and his relaxation of the Soviet Union's iron grip in
Eastern Europe. The AIDS story received 1,830 points for second
place, and the Reagan presidency 1,138 for third. A first-place
vote earned a story 10 points and a 10th-place listing one point.
   The stories by ranking:
   1. Gorbachev assumed leadership in the Soviet Union in 1985 with
a policy of reform of a faltering communist system. In a series of
stunning developments in 1989, he withdrew Soviet troops from
Afghanistan and then stood aside as mass popular movements undercut
Communist power in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany. Gorbachev even gave tacit approval in November as the
incarnation of the Cold War, the Berlin Wall, crumbled amid joyous
celebrations by East and West Germans.
   2. AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ first made its
deadly appearance in the United States in male homosexual
communities. It spread relentlessly among heterosexuals and drug
addicts through sexual contact and shared hypodermic needles. In an
age of ``miracle'' drugs, science could not find an antidote to the
plague of AIDS' lingering death.
   3. Republican Reagan was elected in 1980 vowing to trim the
federal government. He cut taxes sharply and shrank social programs
in a fundamental reversal of government trends. Huge defense
outlays during his two terms, however, created enormous deficits
and more than doubled the national debt. The former film star
brought Hollywood techniques to campaigning and the White House,
sent troops to the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, named the
first woman to the Supreme Court, softened his view of the Soviet
``evil empire,'' survived an assassin's bullet and left office as
popular as when he entered it.
   4. Drug addiction and the crime that comes with it rotted the
core of America's inner cities and spread across the landscape.
Efforts to halt the flow of cocaine from the Andean valleys of
South America were only marginally successful, and some responsible
people debated the legalization of drugs.
   5. In the 1980s, the United States launched reusable manned
spacecraft _ the shuttle. But the explosion of the shuttle
Challenger, just after launch from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 28, 1986,
shut down the U.S. manned space program for two years. All seven
aboard Challenger, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, were
killed. A faulty seal on the rocket shell and unusually cold
weather were blamed.
   6. Terrorism zeroed in on American targets through the 1980s,
most agonizingly in Iran, where 52 Americans _ and with them the
presidency of Jimmy Carter _ were held hostage for 444 days by
followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   7. An explosion and fire in a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in
the Soviet Ukraine in 1986 killed at least 31 people, forced the
evacuation of thousands, and spewed radioactive clouds that circled
the globe. It was a severe setback to nuclear energy.
   8. Communist China liberalized its economic system through the
1980s. In 1989, freedom began to blossom with the spring in
Beijing, only to be brutally suppressed when Chinese troops killed
hundreds, if not thousands, of protesting students in Tiananmen
Square.
   9. Lt. Col. Oliver North became a national figure overnight in
1986 when it was learned the United States had sold arms to Iran
and used some of the proceeds to supply pro-American guerrillas in
Nicaragua. Dramatic congressional hearings and prosecutions
attempted to learn who, including President Reagan and Vice
President George Bush, knew what and when.
   10. Washington, haunted by memories of Vietnam, walked a
tightrope all decade long through civil wars in El Salvador and
Nicaragua. Efforts to support democratic government in El Salvador
were embarrassed by right-wing death squads within the military. In
leftist Nicaragua, U.S. assistance for the Contra guerrillas wound
down as President Bush succeeded Reagan, who had called the Contras
the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.
   Among other stories receiving votes were the continuing
political and legal showdown over abortion, the U.S. trade deficit,
the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the rise of democratic movements
in the Third World, such as Corazon Aquino's in the Philippines,
the 1987 free fall of the stock market, the continuing U.S. trade
deficit, scandals in the TV ministries of Jim Bakker and Jimmy
Swaggart.
   Further down the list: concern for the world environment, the
homeless on American streets, the deaths of 270 in the explosion of
Pan Am Flight 203 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the deaths of more than
3,000 in the Union Carbide gas leak at Bhopal, India, the
earthquakes in Mexico City and San Francisco, the eruption of the
Mount St. Helens volcano, Hurricane Hugo, continuing troubles in
the Mideast, Pope John Paul II wounded in an assassination attempt,
takeover fever in the U.S. business world, change in South Africa,
the assassination of India's Indira Gandhi.

<HEAD>Mythical New York Town Is Home for Capra's Christmas Carol</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Frank Capra set his celebrated movie ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' in the central New York town of Bedford Falls. But
don't look for it on a map. Bedford Falls is a fictional place set
among the small towns between Syracuse and Rochester.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's Christmas Eve. Small-town banker George Bailey is short
$8,000, and he's come to the railing of a snow-covered bridge
somewhere in rural New York to end his life.
   Luckily for George, in the place from where guardian angel
Clarence Odbody comes it's against the law to commit suicide.
Clarence stops George by jumping into the icy river below. George,
the goodest of Good Samaritans, hears Clarence's call for help and
dives in to save him. And that's how Clarence saves George.
   George, Clarence and the simple people of Bedford Falls, N.Y.,
have reappeared for the past 43 Christmases in endless reruns of
Frank Capra's holiday treat, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   The movie, with its excellent use of screen narrative and
effective lighting for black and white, is one of Capra's greatest
works. A colorized version was made after television entrepreneur
Ted Turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought
MGM-UA Entertainment Corp. with its huge film library for $1.5
billion.
   But Capra was furious with the tinted results. ``This
monstrosity is an embarrassment to me and my friend, James
Stewart,'' the filmmaker said. ``They splashed it all over with
Easter egg colors and they ruined it.
   ``Even the villian looks pink and cheerful. The story,
therefore, has been changed.''
   With the 1951 Alastair Sim version of ``A Christmas Carol'' and
1947's ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' the Capra movie is one of the
most popular holiday videos around. And according to 1988 sales
figures from Erol's Inc., the nation's largest independent video
chain, the black and white version of ``It's a Wonderful Life''
outsells the colorized version.
   The movie tells the tale of the American Little Man, the story
of Scrooge from Bob Cratchit's viewpoint. George Bailey, born for
better things, is trapped by circumstance in the same dreary life
his father led.
   ``It's a Wonderful Life'' shows that while life can be ``an
enriching Norman Rockwell experience, it also can be smothering,
where you end up marrying the girl you went to high school with,
and you never get to go to Europe,'' said Ray Carney, an American
studies professor at Boston University.
   ``It tells us George is one of the most sad and lonely and
tragic characters ever imagined. I cry when I see it,'' said
Carney, who wrote a book called ``American Vision: The Films of
Frank Capra.''
   Capra set the movie in the central New York town of Bedford
Falls, a fictional place set among the small towns between Syracuse
and Rochester.
   Instead of George (James Stewart) shaking ``the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet,'' events conspire to keep him in
Bedford Falls, running his father's savings and loan and battling
the rich town villain, Potter.
   Endless sacrifice to a town he hates embitters George. On
Christmas Eve, he faces embezzlement charges after his bumbling
uncle loses $8,000 of the savings and loan's money. George stands
on the bridge fingering his life insurance policy, mulling Potter's
mocking words: ``You're worth more dead than alive.''
   Clarence (Henry Travers) drops in and shows George what the
world would be like if he had never been born. Bedford Falls
becomes a sleazy pleasure town run by Potter, his children are
never born and his wife (Donna Reed) is an old maid. People also
die because George wasn't there, because if he had lived, he would
save his brother from drowning and his brother in turn would be
alive to save a shipload of servicemen during World War II.
   ``Strange, isn't it?'' Clarence says. ``Each man's life touches
so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful
hole, doesn't he? ... You see, George, you really had a wonderful
life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it all
away?''
   Clarence's words sum up the movie for Jimmy Hawkins, who at age
4 played Tommy Bailey, George's son. Hawkins' most memorable line
was ``Excuse me,'' words he kept repeating to an enraged Stewart.
   ``That's the way Capra worked,'' said Hawkins, now a movie
producer. ``In a scene with a lot of tragedy going on, when Jimmy
Stewart is so angry, he throws in that touch of levity. That's
great filmmaking.''
   While the movie has the happiest of endings, its suicide theme
apparently kept many viewers away. The film opened Dec. 20, 1946.
   ``It's really a very dark film,'' said Jeanine Basinger, a film
professor and curator of the Frank Capra Archives at Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn. ``In a way it's a disturbing movie.
At the time, I think maybe people just wanted something light, like
`Miracle on 34th Street.'''
   The movie sets the American Dream alongside the American
nightmare, coming out of a period when the nation was ``confronting
Hitler and confronting evil and wondering about its adequacy as a
society,'' Carney said.
   While there were reports that RKO lost $525,000 on ``It's a
Wonderful Life,'' the movie actually broke even or made just a
little over its $3 million budget, Basinger said.
   With hits such as ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and ``It
Happened One Night'' behind him, Capra hoped for better on his
first post-war movie. In the long run, he got his wish.
   Its popularity grew after Paramount, which bought Capra's
production company, forgot to renew the copyright to ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' in 1974. Television stations learned they could
show the movie free. Marlo Thomas starred in a TV remake.
    The movie was based on a short story, ``The Greatest Gift'' by
Philip Van Doren Stern. Stern couldn't find a publisher, so he
printed 200 copies as Christmas cards for friends.
   RKO bought the rights for $10,000, planning to put Cary Grant in
the lead. After three scripts, including efforts by Clifford Odets
and Dalton Trumbo, RKO sold the project to Capra in 1945.
   With a new script in hand, the director assembled one of
Hollywood's greatest ensembles of character actors, casting many
against type. Lionel Barrymore, known for his grandfatherly roles,
played the villain Potter, while H.B. Warner, best known for
playing Christ in Cecil B. DeMille's ``King of Kings'' in 1927,
played the drunken druggist Gower. Thomas Mitchell, Scarlett
O'Hara's father in ``Gone With the Wind,'' played the inept Uncle
Billy.
   While he had a magnificent cast and script, Capra himself gave
the movie its lasting appeal through his vision of small-town joy
and agony. Capra should be viewed as one of America's greatest
artists, whose works rank with the paintings of Edward Hopper, the
stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne and the novels of Henry James,
Carney said.
   ``Some films like `It's a Wonderful Life' and `Casablanca' are
as profound and moving as any art produced in this century,'' he
said. ``The movie is one of the greatest American masterpieces.''

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. says it may
cut up to 25,000 jobs this year and plans to cut 8,500 in 1990, a
result of labor-saving technology and tough competition.
   AT&amp;T has been cutting jobs steadily since the Bell System
breakup of Jan. 1, 1984, when the local phone companies were split
off into seven regional companies nicknamed the Baby Bells.
   The company said Monday it estimates the total reduction in 1989
will end up at 22,000 to 23,000 jobs and but added it could range
as high as 25,000 depending on the number of voluntary separations.
The cuts are due mostly to modernization and overstaffing.

   In a 7-2 ruling Monday, the court let judges help plaintiffs in
such suits locate other possible victims and seek their

   The Institute for International Economics said Monday that the
growth of foreign ownership has not translated into a loss of jobs
for Americans and that foreign firms paid their U.S. workers the
same as domestic firms.
   The institute argued against changing U.S. laws to block foreign

foreign ownership was not of concern.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Americans are
picking Christmas trees this season by poring over catalogs rather
than trudging around tree farms or corner lots.
   A number of companies ranging from major merchandisers to tiny
nurseries, from Michigan to Maine, are selling freshly cut
Christmas trees by mail.
   ``I suppose some people consider it a very strange thing to do
or perhaps the ultimate in being overboard with catalog ideas,''
said Katherine Hartnett of L.L. Bean Inc.
   Freeport, Maine-based Bean is in its fifth year of offering
holiday greenery as well as clothing and outdoor gear. Hartnett
said the mail-order company's trees sold out this year.
   About 500,000 people will bypass corner Christmas tree lots and
garden supply stores this year and order their trees from a
catalog, said Dave Baumann, associate executive director of the
Milwaukee-based National Christmas Tree Association.
   ``People want tradition, the feeling, the scent, the beauty of a
real tree,'' he said. ``But time is at a premium.''
   Mail-order trees make a small dent in the estimated 35.2 million
Christmas trees that will be sold nationwide this season, but they
have been a welcome new market for an industry facing an increasing
oversupply problem.
   The market for real trees is larger than it ever has been, but
growers this year are cutting an estimated 40 million trees, said
Barry Brand of the Michigan Christmas Tree Association. That could
mean millions of trees will remain in growers' yards and on
retailers' lots by Dec. 25.
   ``Trees by mail have come on very strong in the last five years,
when L.L. Bean was one of the first direct-mail merchandisers,''
Brand said. ``This year, they're being sold by Spiegel and Sears
and Neiman-Marcus and The Sharper Image ... Literally all of the
catalogs are carrying a real tree. They're taking something from a
fad to an established practice.''
   Mail-order trees generally are cut days before being stuffed
into narrow boxes and shipped, usually by private delivery
companies. The trees are expensive, but their prices often are
matched by those on Christmas tree lots in some of the nation's
larger cities.
   And the mail-order trees often are fresher, because most trees
sold from lots are cut at Thanksgiving or earlier, while mail-order
trees typically are cut the day before shipment.
   A 7-foot Sears Roebuck and Co. tree sells for $74.86. A
Maine-grown tree from L.L. Bean costs $55. Neither company would
give figures for its tree sales.
   Many of the buyers appear to be big-city dwellers who don't have
cars and want to be spared the hassle of carrying a tree to their
apartment.
   But mail-order trees haven't necessarily been an easy sell.
   In Michigan, the nation's largest Christmas tree producing
state, nursery owners Paul and Jaye Shereda have had trouble
pitching their mail-order trees to Chicagoans.
   ``People are very suspicious,'' Jaye Shereda said from her home
in Custer, a tiny town in the heart of central Michigan's Christmas
tree country.
   ``Even though we're charging $35 a tree, or $55 for the package
with the stand, they're afraid we're too cheap. They're suspicious
we're going to send them junk,'' she said.
   Their company, Land O' Pines, spent a total of $10,000 in
advertising the past two seasons but sold only 85 trees, Shereda
said.
   Chicagoan Dan Herrin thought his catalog tree was just perfect,
although he said his neighbors were surprised to see a 6-foot
evergreen slide out of the box left on the doorstep of his
16th-floor apartment.
   Herrin said he doesn't miss the trips he and his wife took into
the country to cut their own tree.
   ``I think everybody thinks it's a good sign of what technology
can do for us all,'' Herrin said. ``Here we're getting at a
reasonable price a better product that what you used to be able to
find.
   ``It's the overall picture of convenience.''

   Economic growth in the United States, Canada and
Britain likely will be below average among developed countries next
year, according to a top official of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the GATT, also said Monday
that prospects were ``dim'' for reducing the current account
imbalances between major trading partners such as the United
States, West Germany and Japan and that trade-restricting domestic
policies remained widespread.
   In the Overview of Developments in the International Trading
Environment, Dunkel said there had been much progress towards trade
liberalization since the current Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations began in 1986, but protectionist pressures continued.
   Dunkel urged countries not to use unilateral or bilateral
measures to settle trade disputes pending agreement on new, more
comprehensive international rules by next December when the
four-year Uruguay Round ends.
   He warned that such action would jeopardize the success of the
negotiations.
   Under terms of trade legislation enacted last year, the United
States in May singled out Japan, Brazil and India as having the
worst restrictions against U.S. exports and threatened retaliation
if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks.
   The GATT report warned of continuing pressure by trade-deficit
countries to use protectionism or to press trading partners to
change their trading policies to help shrink the imbalances.
   ``The problem is not just that such an approach could involve
policy actions which would be inconsistent with the spirit _ if not
the letter _ of the General Agreement (on Tariffs and Trade), but
that these policies by themselves will be ineffective in bringing
about a lasting reduction in the imbalances,'' Dunkel stated.
   The GATT director-general said that although many countries had
taken steps to liberalize trade, policies to regulate imports
remained widespread.
   Dunkel cited the growing use of anti-dumping measures, whereby
countries try to prevent goods from being ``dumped'' their markets
at prices below those charged by the exporter in its own domestic
market.
   He said that after tariffs, anti-dumping legislation was the
most frequently invoked trade policy instrument in many
industrialized countries.
   The 97 members of GATT, which sponsors trade liberalizing
negotiations and sets world trade rules, account for more than 80
percent of international trade.
   The GATT report said the United States was certain this year to
again become the world's leading exporter in dollar value,
recapturing the position it lost to West Germany in 1986.
   In the first three quarters of the year, U.S. merchandise
exports grew by 15 percent, more than double the dollar value
increase recorded by Japan and West Germany, the report said.
   However, the rate of expansion was down from 29 percent in 1988.
Combined with a slight slackening of import growth from 9 percent
to 8 percent, this meant the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit
lost momentum, Dunkel said.
   U.S. exports in the first nine months of the year were worth
some $271.3 billion, while the value of imports totalled $365.6
billion, according to GATT figures.
   The overall growth in world trade is likely to slacken next
year, even though 1990 would still mark the eighth consecutive year
of expansion, the report stated.
   Next year, the report predicted, the economies of West European
nations were likely to grow by about 3 percent in output, average
for the industrialized world, while growth in the United States,
Canada and Britain was expected to fall below the average.
   For 1989, world output and merchandise trade were expected to
expand in real terms by 3 percent and 7 percent respectively, the
report stated, marking the fourth straight year trade growth had
outstripped production growth.
   Last year international trade in goods grew by a record 8.5
percent over 1987, according to GATT figures.

   The 1988 drought relief program paid millions of
dollars to farmers across the country whose only claims to disaster
were normal bouts with the perils of nature. One reason the program
was applied so broadly, The Associated Press found, was the very
structure of the payment system. The second story in a four-part

   R.B. Reynolds decides how to spend
millions of federal agriculture dollars each year. He implements
federal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government worker.
   Reynolds, however, is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician,
but a wheat and corn farmer here in wind-swept Hartley County.
   He was elected by his Texas Panhandle neighbors to be chairman
of the three-member committee that runs Hartley County's office of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Every U.S. county with some agriculture has a three-farmer
committee elected by fellow farmers to direct the local office of
the ASCS, which runs all the multibillion-dollar federal
agriculture payment programs.
   It's a job considered unique among government aid programs, with
the very recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many.
   Potential problems and conflicts are obvious: Would welfare
mothers determine their friends' monthly checks or students decide
roommates' eligibility for loans? But agriculture officials believe
the elected committee members are in the best position to assess
fairly the losses suffered by their neighbors _ and to keep them
honest.
   ``We have to follow the rules that come down, but we try to
represent the farmer and his needs and what would be best for
him,'' Reynolds said. ``If you don't represent the farmer, who's
going to?''
   The question of who to protect, the farmer or the government, is
at times a difficult one for conscientious committee members. One
day after Reynolds sided with farmers in an interview, he told a
reporter he preferred to say committee members have to represent
both sides and ``mediate to try to work something out.''
   Most committee members interviewed for an Associated Press study
of the 1988 drought relief effort said they voted for the good of
their neighbors whenever possible.
   ``I would say you're representing the farmer _ maybe that's not
the way it's supposed to be,'' said Mike Bouris, chairman of the
Riverside, Calif., county committee.
   ``You don't want your neighbor to be mad at you because he
didn't qualify,'' said John Rigolizzo Jr., the Camden County, N.J.,
committee chairman. ``Yes, you could say he's sticking up for his
buddy and his neighbor, but when we're in this office, we're
government employees.''
   Committee members, who are paid small stipends for their
meetings, take an oath of office pledging to uphold the laws of
Congress. Agriculture Department officials say they expect the
committees to protect taxpayers as well as be fair to farmers.
   ``They represent both, but they have rules and regulations they
have to obey,'' Dan Shaw, the ASCS deputy administrator in charge
of state and county operations, said from Washington, D.C.
   ``They can't just say this is a deprived area so let's take all
the money in the Treasury and throw it out here,'' Shaw said. ``We
feel peers are the people who can make the really good, accurate
decisions that need to be made.''
   Committees have great latitude in administering agriculture
programs, from establishing normal harvests to deciding if a crop
was cultivated properly. They must sometimes analyze farmers'
financial standings and sort through corporations, partnerships and
trusts. They also have to interpret an array of laws and
regulations.
   ``Some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret. The smart
people can read that and find ways to get around it,'' said Don
Gronewald, a hay farmer who is member of the Kaufman County, Texas,
committee.
   ``All of the programs are good programs, and when they put them
out they had good intentions. But you're going to find somebody
abusing and using the program to their benefit, and that makes it
harder for the honest Joe,'' Gronewald said.
   Agriculture experts say farming in America is so vast that the
local committee system is the only fair way to administer the aid
programs.
   ``There are these glitches. Two counties end up rendering two
different decisions,'' said Bob Bergland, agriculture secretary
under former President Carter. ``But you have to have room for
local judgment. I'd say it works better than almost any other
scheme you can think of.''
   In the case of the drought program, many committees had to set
crop yields and estimate how much would have been harvested in a
normal year, as well as decide if a farmer kept his crop properly
fertilized, weeded and, if possible, watered.
   And the committees of three had to decide whether each applicant
farmer was eligible.
   In some cases, a county committee was more gracious with its
constituents than either insurance companies evaluating the same
losses or committees in neighboring counties interpreting the same
regulations, the AP found.
   A crop insurance company balked at paying one Oklahoma farmer an
irrigated yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo because
he had watered just once. Insurance paid only the dryland yield of
28 bushels. But the county committee granted drought relief based
on the irrigated 69-bushel yield. The farmer received $4,467.
   ``The committee made a determination that it was watered,'' said
David F. Barnes Jr., director of the Texas County, Okla., ASCS
office.
   The Chaves County, N.M., committee decided to pay a farmer
$18,285 for cotton damage caused by ``cold, rainy weather'' and
``high winds,'' although the bill contained provision for neither
freeze-like damage nor wind damage.
   The drought relief program was particularly troublesome for some
committees because it was set up with such haste, officials said.
Some farmers harvested their crops before applying for aid, making
losses difficult to verify.
   In Gaines County, Texas, ASCS director John Wayne Hall said he
struggled with 1988 claims for lost winter wheat _ a crop planted
in 1987 and cut months before Congress even considered the drought
legislation.
   ``How can I know what kind of product that boy had out there? It
was long gone,'' Hall said. ``In '88, we made a lot of judgments.''
   A recent General Accounting Office report noted that the 1988
relief program was hard to administer because it required county
officials to determine, on short notice, payments on close to 500
crops, from almonds to zucchini. The officials had little
experience or data on most of tose crops.
   ``The program happened awful fast,'' said Steve Verrill,
committee chairman in Middlesex County, Mass. ``It was the disaster
in the Midwest and everybody, including the politicians, were
talking it up and they were in an awful hurry to get the money
out.''
   Both the elected farmers and the county directors they hire say
the pressure from farmers _ even in more normal years _ can be
intense.
   ``If I give everybody what they want, I can get along,'' said
Hall. ``If I say `Hey, the regulations say you can't do that,' it
makes 'em mad.''
   Hall sometimes makes 'em mad anyway.
   ``As long as they (the government) pay me, I'll enforce it,'' he
said.

   The 1988 drought assistance bill for U.S.
farmers set a record for disaster programs, totaling $3.9 billion
in payments when all applications had been processed.
   This year, with the drought area reduced and the severity
lessened, Congress tightened eligibility requirements and pulled
the purse strings tighter, authorizing less than 25 percent of the
money released in 1988.
   Here are details of the two relief programs:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Money</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Congress authorized $3.9 billion in cash payments to farmers
who could prove crop losses in 1988; the 1989 authorization is $897
million.
   _Both programs set a $100,000 limit per producer on combined
payments for crop losses and livestock relief.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Eligibility Requirements</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Under each program, an applicant could not have a gross annual
income greater than $2 million.
   _Growers had to absorb crop losses if they totaled less than 35
percent of normal production. The programs differed for losses
above 35 percent.
   The 1988 bill encompassed all crops, from such ``program crops''
as corn, wheat and cotton that the government supports with price
subsidies to riskier crops like kiwi fruit or endive.
   The 1989 bill pays on losses of 35 percent to 50 percent only
for program crops. Farmers of non-program crops are paid only if
losses totaled more than 50 percent of a normal harvest. Whether
producers receive aid also depends on whether they participated in
federal commodity programs and bought crop insurance.
   _The 1988 bill provided two tiers of payment. Farmers received
65 percent of a pre-established payment rate _ based on such
factors as market prices and subsidies _ for losses of 35 percent
to 75 percent of normal production; they got 90 percent of the
payment rate if losses topped 75 percent.
   In 1989, the highest payment for any loss was 65 percent of the
payment rate.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Crop Insurance</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Both programs required farmers with losses greater than 65
percent to buy federal crop insurance the subsequent year. Each
bill permitted some instances in which crop insurance could be
waived.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Replanting Penalty</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _The 1988 bill permitted farmers to receive aid on the early
loss of crops such as winter wheat or cotton, even if they
replanted the same acres with different crops and had normal
harvests.
   To prevent such ``double dipping,'' the 1989 law sharply reduced
benefits to farmers who chose to plant replacement crops due to
drought or other weather conditions. Critics said this penalized
farmers who were simply trying to help themselves, and the law was
modified in October to be more generous.
   As modified, aid payments on damaged crops will be reduced only
if the value of the replacement crop is more than half of the
county's average yield, and then only by the value above the 50
percent threshold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Livestock Provisions</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Both programs provided help for livestock producers, expanding
existing feed and water programs to relieve drought-related
shortages for herds. Eligible livestock include cattle, sheep,
goats, swine, poultry, horses and mules, and fish raised in
commercial ponds.

   This is a summary of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 and
procedures farmers followed to collect aid.
   The program originally was written to provide cash to farmers
who suffered crop losses of more than 35 percent ``due to drought,
hail, excessive moisture or related condition in 1988.''
   Farmers who lost more than 65 percent of their normal harvest
were required to protect themselves with federal crop insurance
this year.
   The bill covered all crops in all states, not just drought
areas. As its regulations moved from the halls of Congress to the
county offices where the checks were written, the list of weather
conditions eligible for aid grew. It eventually included _
depending on the individual county _ insects, sandstorms, fungus,
high winds and cold.
   The bill required farmers to state their acreage, whether it was
irrigated and-or insured, the normal yield and the actual
production on that acreage. They also had to state the cause for
their loss, and in what manner the land had been farmed.
   Their applications for aid were approved or denied by
three-member committees of locally elected farmers serving as the
government's agents.
   Regulations require only 5 percent of aid applications to be
verified for accurate information, although many offices said they
routinely checked 15 percent. As with other farm payment programs,
paperwork remained at the county offices; no regulation requires
data on individual farms to be routinely forwarded to state or
federal headquarters.
   The relief act stated that payments were limited to $100,000 per
farmer and that no producer with gross revenues in excess of $2
million was eligible for aid.
   Checks were written at the county office. Only county totals of
aid, not individual summaries, were fed into national computers.
Federal agriculture officials have not yet compiled figures on the
amount of aid disbursed based on the crops damaged or on the
specific weather problems cited for crop losses.

<HEAD>New Milken Indictment May Be Delayed Until January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delays in delivering an expanded indictment of
junk bond pioneer Michael Milken are expected to push back his
trial by at least six months to September 1990, according to
individuals close to the case.
   The government had said it planned to bring new charges in
October superseding a 98-count indictment against Milken, his
brother, Lowell, and a former Drexel trader.
   But now the federal grand jury hearing the Milken case is
expected to hand up an indictment listing additional charges and
defendants either next week or shortly after Jan. 1, 1990, sources
close to the case, who asked not to be named, said Monday.
   Milken's trial on wide-ranging racketeering and securities fraud
charges is scheduled to start in March, 11 months after the
original indictment was issued.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys would meet to set a new trial
date once the superseding indictment is returned and the defendants
enter pleas. Defense lawyers speaking privately said the trial
likely would not begin before September and possibly could start as
late as January 1991.
   Michael and Lowell Milken have pleaded innocent and said they
intend to fight charges of insider trading, tax fraud, takeover
rigging and numerous other violations that allegedly occurred from
1984 to 1986.
   The original 110-page indictment handed up by a federal grand
jury on March 29 after a 2{-year investigation focuses on an
alleged illegal relationship between Milken and jailed stock
speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The new indictment reportedly will include allegations of
illegal stock and bond deals with Drexel clients other than Boesky,
including Solomon Asset Management and Columbia Savings and Loan
Association, of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Boesky, who is eligible for release from prison in April, is
expected to testify at Milken's trial. Additional charges,
defendants and a roster of witnesses who have been granted immunity
in exchange for testimony are expected to reduce the government's
reliance on Boesky.
   Sources on Monday confirmed a report that Gary Winnick, a former
top associate of Milken's at Drexel's high-yield bond division in
Beverly Hills, Calif., was given immunity from prosecution and
ordered to testify in the case.
   Winnick previously was subpoenaed to turn over documents but
never was threatened with prosecution. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis,
declined to comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll did not
return a call seeking comment.
   Also, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the Justice
Department had approved bringing racketeering charges in the Milken
case against three other former Drexel workers and against former
Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, who was named in the first indictment.
   A Justice Department spokesman said the department would not
comment.
   Milken attorney Martin Flumenbaum said: ``The leaks concerning
the grand jury process are designed to deny Michael Milken a fair
trial. We will not comment on those leaks, whether true or not, and
will no try this case in the press.''
   Newberg was sentenced to three months in prison and ordered to
forfeit $200,000 on securities fraud and racketeering charges in
the Princeton-Newport partners trial last summer. His attorneys are
expected to argue that he should not be tried twice on similar
charges.
   Milken, 43, has set aside about $700 million in assets as part
of a bond package and is free pending trial. Milken, widely
credited with reshaping U.S. corporate finance through the use of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, resigned from Drexel earlier this
year to form an investment consulting firm.

<HEAD>Forecaster Expects Slight Improvement in 1990 Ad Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic advertising spending should grow
slightly faster in 1990 than it did in 1989 and should improve
further through the next decade, a prominent media forecaster says.
   Robert J. Coen, who heads the forecasting unit at the
advertising agency McCann-Erickson, said in his semiannual
projection Monday that ad spending will rise 6.2 percent next year
to $132.6 billion, following 5.8 percent growth in 1989.
   ``The outlook for the opening year of the decade is rather
modest, but the pace of ad growth can be expected to improve as the
decade unfolds,'' he said.
   Coen's estimate included projected increases of 6.3 percent in
national ad spending to $73.85 billion next year, and 6.2 percent
in local ad spending to $58.79 billion.
   National ad spending rose 5.9 percent this year while local ad
spending was up 5.5 percent, he said.
   A year ago, Coen projected a 6.1 percent spending increase for
1989 and boosted that estimate last summer to 6.9 percent.
   He said ad spending came in below both projections because of
slower-than-expected growth in direct mail advertising due to a
postal rate increase.
   Advertising overseas is expected to rise 5 percent to $133.7
billion next year, matching its 1989 rise, Coen said.
   His remarks came at the start of a weeklong media conference for
securities analysts conducted for the 17th year by the investment
firm PaineWebber Inc.
   Coen said economists expect the U.S. gross national product will
grow 5.8 percent in 1990 including inflation, down from 7.2 percent
in 1989.
   But Coen said he saw signs indicating the ad outlook is
improving despite the weakening economy: stronger than expected
growth in ad spending in the mass consumer media such as radio,
television, magazines and newspapers in 1989 and healthy growth in
key ad categories such as automobiles, restaurants, liquor and
computers.
   He said national advertisers are expected to make their biggest
ad spending increases in the broadcast media: a 6.9 percent jump in
1990.
   Cable TV and syndicated TV will have double-digit growth again
although below their 30 percent and 35 percent increases of 1989,
Coen said, while radio will be up but at a slower pace.
   He said the three major TV networks also will have an increase
of unspecified proportions, compared with almost no growth in ad
revenue in 1989.
   In a separate appearance, David F. Poltrack, senior vice
president for planning and research at CBS Broadcast Group, said he
expected a combined 8 percent to 9 percent rise in revenues for
CBS, ABC and NBC next year and compound annual growth of 7.5
percent through 1995.
   Coen said national print advertising will rise 6.6 percent, with
magazine growth moderating and spending in newspapers remaining
soft.
   Local newspaper advertising spending is expected to rise 6.0
percent ``held back to some extent by very soft demand for
classified advertising,'' Coen said. Local advertising on broadcast
media is expected to rise 6.6 percent with a stimulus from
congressional campaign ads.
   In a separate panel discussion of the outlook for newspapers in
1990, Jerome S. Tilis, a marketing executive for Knight-Ridder
Newspaper Sales, said he expects a 5 percent increase in overall
newspaper ad revenue in 1990, compared with estimated growth of 5
percent to 6 percent this year.
   He said he expects turmoil caused by takeovers in the retailing
business will settle down and help retail advertising in
newspapers, and that gains in real estate and automotive classified
advertising will help offset a drop in help-wanted ads.
   Tilis said newspapers should benefit from price increases for
direct mail advertising, continuing fragmentation of the network TV
audience and development of newspaper networks such as the one that
resulted in creation of an ``advertising island'' in the middle of
the stock listings in some papers.
   Jack Butcher, circulation director of the Tampa Tribune, said he
expects industrywide circulation gains next year amounting to less
than a quarter percent daily and less than 1 percent on Sundays, or
about the same as in 1989.
   Homer Taylor, vice president-supply for Knight-Ridder Inc., said
newsprint costs may fall 5 percent on average in 1990, compared
with an average 6 percent decline this year.
   Gordon Medenica, director of planning for The New York Times
Co., said newspaper earnings should be up by ``a modest uptick but
nonetheless up'' compared with this year.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Analysis Suggested Sales of Five Great Northern Mills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s proposed takeover
of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. could be made more affordable if
the hostile suitor sold five Great Northern mills, according to a
consultant's report unsealed Monday by a federal judge.
   Great Northern immediately accused Georgia-Pacific of a
``cover-up.'' But Georgia-Pacific disputed the contention it had a
``secret plan'' to sell the mills in Millinocket and East
Millinocket, Maine; Valdosta, Ga; and Nekoosa and Port Edwards.,
Wis.
   U.S. District Judge Gene Carter unsealed the private study,
which was included in a Great Northern counterclaim that accused
Georgia-Pacific of violating federal securities laws by trying to
keep the study secret. Lawyers had argued over the unsealing in a
closed-door session Friday.
   Georgia-Pacific fought disclosure of the document, but once it
was unsealed, the Atlanta-based company quickly issued a statement
saying that the consultant's study had been rejected as the merger
attempt was planned.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. and other
corporate executives have been in Maine recently to say there were
no plans to sell any Maine assets to pay for the tender offer of
$63 per share, or $3.8 billion. Great Northern is incorporated in
Maine.
   The study, commissioned by Georgia-Pacific before it made its
initial offer of $58 per share Oct. 31, paints a different picture,
but Georgia-Pacific said it never accepted the study's
recommendations.
   Great Northern saw the study differently.
   ``The public should know this document exists in order to weigh
statements made by Mr. Hahn and Georgia-Pacific representatives
about their motives, about their plans and what went into their
planning,'' Great Northern attorney Robert A. Moore said.
   The study indicated that Georgia-Pacific could cut its merger
costs from $4.4 billion to $3.3 billion by selling the mills, Great
Northern said.
   Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig issued a statment from
company headquarters in Norwalk, Conn., that said: ``I am appalled,
quite frankly, that even after we discovered this study,
Georgia-Pacific attempted to continue its cover-up, forcing us to
go to court to have the judge order the disclosure of our claims to
the public.''
   Great Northern's counterclaim was made in response to a lawsuit
filed in U.S. District Court here by Georgia-Pacific, which is
challenging ``poison pill'' provisions of Great Northern's bylaws
as well as Maine's anti-takeover statute, which forces hostile
suitors to wait five years before merging with a targeted company.

<TEXT>
   A popular home computer service has eliminated a
``bulletin board'' that fostered an electronic shouting match
between homosexuals and Christian fundamentalists, but it denies it
was pressured to do so.
   Prodigy, an IBM-Sears joint venture, said Monday the bulletin
board was cancelled because it was too lightly used, but some vocal
customers say Prodigy simply wanted to avoid controversy.
   The dispute over Prodigy's Health Spa bulletin board is the
first notable controversy to affect the service, which has grown
rapidly in the past year and now serves more than a quarter-million
users in 160,000 subscriber households.
   Prodigy officials, while dismayed about the negative publicity,
see the Health Spa fight as evidence that the service has attracted
some highly committed customers.
   ``If we weren't expanding so rapidly, I don't think we would
have gotten this kind of attention,'' said Brian Ek, a spokesman at
Prodigy headquarters in White Plains, N.Y.
   Prodigy is a $10-a-month service for personal computers that
gives users access to services for shopping, airline reservations,
news and stock trading. It also has bulletin boards, which let
subscribers post electronic messages and communicate with each
other.
   Health Spa essentially was a forum for people to post news and
exchange information on health-related topics.
   It was discontinued last Wednesday on short notice. According to
several users, the only controversial section of it was one on
``emotional health,'' which included discussions of such topics as
mental health. The section became a battleground of homosexuals and
fundamentalists and required constant supervision and occasional
censorship.
   Other sections covered topics such as health, fitness and
support groups.
   Some users said the complaints about the discontinuation were
coming from homosexuals, while others are coming from people who
used the other sections and believe they were caught in the middle.
   A Georgia user who asked not to be identified said he had
participated in the debates on the bulletin board, from the gay
viewpoint. He also said some subscribers had complained that
homosexuality was not an appropriate topic because children could
be reading.
   Prodigy's Ek said Health Spa was cut because it was lightly
used, but some protesting subscribers dispute that.
   One survey showed the emotional health bulletin board getting an
average of 20 pages a day in entries, compared to one or two pages
a day for many other bulletin boards that remain in operation, said
Larry Holliday, a New York executive. A page is a computer screen's
worth of information.
   Holliday said he did not use the emotional health section but
did use other sections of Health Spa.
   Ek said the heavy use was by a small number of people. He said
other services with few entries were kept because many people
browsed through them without making entries.
   Ek also said the monitoring to make sure Health Spa met decency
standards for a family service was time-consuming, and said
bulletin board monitors frequently had to reject submissions due to
profanity and references to sexual practices.
   ``It's a cost-benefit ratio,'' he said. He indicated possible
grounds for compromise by saying some parts of Health Spa might be
brought back in a different form.
   Prodigy differs from other computer services in that the
bulletin boards are only a small part of what it offers. It also
differs in that it carries advertising, which constantly appears on
a portion of the screen.
   Some subscribers say they believe, without specific evidence,
that Prodigy is trying to avoid any controversy or offensiveness to
please advertisers, who account for most of its revenue.
   ``We are simply the people who are offered up for sale, which is
why what we think isn't that important,'' said Cyndie Merten of San
Jose, Calif.
   Ek denies that, as well as allegations that Christian
fundamentalists brought pressure on Prodigy.
   Prodigy has not yet achieved profitability, but has the backing
of two companies with deep pockets, International Business Machines
Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
   Ek said he finds it hard to understand why Prodigy has drawn
such criticism, considering that newspapers routinely screen
letters to the editor and television networks drop shows that
aren't working out.
   ``We're a family service. If we feel that there is something in
there that should not be in there for a family audience, we do not
put it in,'' he said.
   The discontinuation of Health Spa was reported Sunday by the San
Jose Mercury News.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Confirms Up to 25,000 Job Cuts; Plans 8,500 More in '90</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. says it may
cut up to 25,000 jobs this year and plans to eliminate 8,500 more
in 1990, a result of labor-saving technology and tough competition.
   Analysts on Monday praised AT&amp;T's cost-slashing, which they said
should help the company improve profitability.
   ``It's really demonstrating that a very, very significant
cultural change is going on within AT&amp;T. Bob Allen (the chairman)
is recognizing that the ultimate boss is the shareholder,'' said
Charles Nichols, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst.
   The cuts were less popular with AT&amp;T's largest union, the
Communications Workers of America, which said customer service was
bound to suffer. It said AT&amp;T was being short-sighted by cutting
skilled employees at a time when labor shortages are developing.
   ``We can only conclude that AT&amp;T cares more about cutting costs
in the short run than about building revenue for the long run,''
said Gaye Williams Mack, a union spokeswoman.
   AT&amp;T stock rose 75 cents to $44.37{ a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   AT&amp;T has been eliminating jobs steadily since the Bell System
breakup of Jan. 1, 1984, when the local phone companies were split
off into seven regional companies known as the Baby Bells.
Employment fell from 373,000 then to 297,000 by the end of October
1989.
   About half the cuts have come through layoffs and half through
retirements and other voluntary separations, spokesman Burke
Stinson said.
   Stinson said he estimates the total reduction in 1989 will end
up at about 22,000 to 23,000 jobs and said the drop could range as
high as 25,000 depending on the number of voluntary separations.
   Modernization is one big reason for the cuts. Automated
switching technology has allowed AT&amp;T to cut its ranks of operators
drastically. Also, many employees who operated, installed and
serviced phone equipment are being phased out as the company
changes to high-tech digital equipment.
   Another reason for cuts is that AT&amp;T was overstaffed before the
breakup. It could afford extra layers of employees as long as it
was a monopoly, but rising competition since the breakup has forced
it to pare down.
   AT&amp;T's aggressiveness in cutting costs is matched by a new
determination to fight back in the long-distance business against
MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., its
closest rivals.
   Nichols said he expects those companies to continue eating into
AT&amp;T's share of the market, but far more slowly than in the past
few years. The company also is battling rivals in sales of network
switching equipment, office phone systems and computers.
   A sign of AT&amp;T's tough-guy approach was its recent victory
against Asian makers of small-business phone systems. The
International Trade Commission ruled on a company complaint that
phone systems from Japan and Taiwan were being ``dumped'' in the
United States at unfairly low prices and ordered special tariffs on
them.
   AT&amp;T last week told analysts it planned to cut 6,000 jobs next
year in the Network Services division, which runs the long-distance
network. It also plans to cut 700 in Business Communications
Systems, 1,400 in Material Management and Services, and 400 in
General Business Systems.
   The largest portion of the 1989 cuts came from AT&amp;T's first
drive to cut middle management through sweetened pension offerings
for those who accepted early retirement. About 12,000 to 13,000
managers have chosen early retirement under that program.
   Two thousand other managers left before that incentive program
began. The company also cut 5,000 operators and says it expects to
cut other jobs through normal attrition, possibly as many as 6,000.

   The dollar fell against all major foreign
currencies today in thin European trading, dealers said.
   Gold prices were mixed as selling pressure cut into early highs,
precious metal traders said.
   Dealers predicted little market activity today with traders on
the sidelines waiting for economic news expected later in the week.
   U.S. retail sales figures are due out Wednesday and U.S. trade
data for October will be released Friday.
   ``With all the indicators coming, I don't see a big trading day
today,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers
Hanover in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.18 yen to a closing 144.47 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices: 1.7522 West German marks, down from 1.7660; 1.5885 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5970; 5.9930 French francs, down from 6.0370;

down from 1,304.25; and 1.1630 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1632.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6030 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5895 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.40 a troy ounce, up
from $416.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $416.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $416, up from $415.75 bid late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $3.55 to close at a bid $415.81.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.70 a troy ounce, down

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
today after a seven-day gain, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index rose slightly.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 50.86
points, or 0.13 percent, closing at 37,803.53. It had gained 28.61
points Monday.
   The dollar closed at 144.47 yen, down 0.18 yen from Monday's
144.65-yen finish. It opened at 144.41 yen and ranged between
144.40 yen and 144.58 yen. In the previous seven trading days, the
dollar had gained a total of 1.75 yen.
   ``Trading was very quiet, and nothing really happened today,''
said Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Market players, fearing central bank intervention, were
reluctant to make major moves, she said. Spot trading volume was
$3.87 billion.
   The Bank of Japan was reported to have sold dollars at around
144.50 yen shortly after Tokyo trading opened today, following
intervention in the New York market by the Federal Reserve to curb
the dollar's rise against the yen.
   Today's sales by the Bank of Japan had no major impact on
exchange rate movements or the tone of trading, and no further
central bank intervention was observed later in the day, Ms.
Takeuchi said.
   The Bank of Japan was believed to have sold dollars on the
market several times Monday to keep the dollar within a narrow
range. The central bank does not comment on its exchange market
activities.
   On the stock exchange, trading was active in the morning and
issues related to natural resources were strong sellers, but
investors later stepped to the sidelines in the absence of
market-affecting news, said a dealer with Nomura Securities Co.
   Of the estimated first section volume of 800 million shares,
only 200 million were traded in the afternoon. An estimated 700
million shares changed hands on Monday.
   ``I'm pretty sure the index would have fallen if the investment
trust companies had not conducted index-buying in the afternoon,''
said the Nomura dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In index-buying, an investor can buy a minimum of 1,000 shares
in all of the Nikkei's 225 items, a transaction that costs billions
of dollars.
   Such purchases in the afternoon contributed to raising the index
by some 100 points, the dealer said.
   Other dealers said investors sold steel issues, which many
market players had recently bought, to take profits.

   Stock in Britain's newly privatized 10 water
authorities soared to premiums of up to 64 percent when official
trading in the stocks began Tuesday on London's Stock Exchange.
   Prices then fell back and steadied, showing a maximum premium of
50 percent.
   The start of trading overshadowed other business in the London
market and the hefty price gains helped to ensure a buoyant mood.
   The privatization, which raised 5.24 billion pounds, or $8.4
billion, was 5.7 times oversubscribed with 47 percent of the total
amount of shares going to the British public. The rest was
allocated to British institutions and overseas investors.
   The government sold 2.183 million shares at 240 pence, or $3.84
each, payable in three installments.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold billions of pounds worth of state-owned companies in the past
decade to promote capitalism in Britain.

<HEAD>Last French Currency Controls To Be Lifted By Jan. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's last remaining currency controls will be
lifted on Jan. 1, 1990, the Finance Ministry announced Tuesday.
   The widely anticipated move will allow French residents to hold
foreign currency accounts inside the country and open bank accounts
outside France.
   Under a timetable set up by the European Community, France and
most other Common Market countries have until July 1, 1990 to lift
their controls on capital movement. Spain, Portugal and Greece have
until Jan. 1, 1993.
   The bulk of France's currency controls covering major capital
movement by corporations were dismantled gradually in a series of
steps that began in 1984.
   The ministry said in a statement the lifting of the controls
reflects government ``confidence in the good health of the French
economy and in the stability of our currency.''
   The move also underlines ``our desire to accelerate progress
toward European monetary union,'' the statement said.
   A ministry spokeswoman confirmed that French residents will be
obliged to notify authorities when they open foreign bank accounts,
as they must do for accounts opened in France.
   Currency traders said the announcement did not have any
immediate impact on the foreign exchange market. They said the lack
of response reflected the relatively limited scope of the remaining
controls and the market's knowledge that they were already
scheduled to come down by July 1, 1990 at the latest.
   The decision by France to lift its exchange controls removes one
of the obstacles frequently cited by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher that has prevented Britain from seeking full
membership for its currency in the European Monetary System.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Drops for Seventh Straight Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapidly growing imports pushed Japan's trade
surplus sharply lower in November, its seventh consecutive monthly
decline from year-earlier levels, the Finance Ministry announced
Tuesday.
   The trade surplus, calculated on a customs-clearance basis,
shrank 46.2 percent to $3.53 billion from a year earlier, when it
registered $6.56 billion dollars, the ministry said. The surplus
also fell from October's $4.65 billion.
   Exports dropped 2.9 percent from their year-earlier level to
$22.03 billion, while imports climbed 14.8 percent to $18.50
billion, the ministry said.
   The trade surplus' latest decline from year-earlier levels was
the largest since October 1982, when it fell 54.1 percent.
   Japan's surplus with the United States declined from
year-earlier levels for the second consecutive month, falling 19.3
percent to $3.57 billion.
   Imports from the United States, buoyed by increased purchases of
aircraft, office equipment and nonferrous metals, grew 12.1 percent
to $4.08 billion. Exports to the United States dropped 5.2 percent
to $7.65 billion, largely because of falling auto shipments,
ministry officials said.
   Ministry officials attributed the decline in the overall surplus
mainly to growing imports of crude oil, both in value and volume
terms. Because of rising world oil prices, the average price of oil
jumped 38.3 percent from a year earlier to $17.41 a barrel, while
volume increased by 12.9 percent to 4.9 billion gallons, they said.
   Imports of manufactured goods also rose 13 percent from the
previous year and accounted for 50.6 percent of overall imports,
they said. It was the sixth month in a row that manufactured goods
exceeded 50 percent of total imports.
   In contrast, exports of motor vehicles fell 9.4 percent because
of sluggish demand and rising production by Japanese manufacturers
in North America, they said. Steel exports fell 23.6 percent
because of weak worldwide sales, the officials added.
   Compared to their October levels, exports declined 4.4 percent
and imports rose 0.7 percent, the ministry said.
   Although Japan's trade surplus, a target of sharp criticism from
the United States and other trading partners, has fallen for seven
months in a row, ministry officials said they were not sure whether
the decline was permanent.
   ``We have to see what the future will bring,'' said an official
in charge of trade data. ``A lot of things will depend on how oil
prices will change, and there are other elements of uncertainty.''
   After seasonal factors were taken into account, the November
trade surplus came to $4.70 billion, up from $3.77 billion the
previous month.
   Japan calculates its trade surplus figures on a
customs-clearance basis, in which freight and insurance costs are
included in import figures but not in exports.

<HEAD>Reported Management Plan Emerges for UAL Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. management has drafted a preliminary
$5.43 billion employee buyout proposal for the parent of United
Airlines, but unions representing UAL workers appear to be balking,
a published report said today.
   The plan would place a nominal value of $240 on a share of
common stock, the Chicago Tribune reported, quoting unidentified
sources. It also contemplates UAL employees owning about two-thirds
of the stock after a buyout, and public stockholders about
one-third, the Tribune said.
   Management officials made buyout proposals last week to United
Airlines' pilots' and flight attendants' unions, the paper said.
   While the UAL board of directors is scheduled to meet Wednesday,
the sources said management is not expected to present any buyout
proposal then.
   In October, a $6.75 billion, or $300 a share, buyout attempt
failed for lack of financing.
   That proposal was undercut by the Machinists' union, which
opposes a highly leveraged buyout of the airline.
   A Machinists' source told the Tribune that if speculation about
a $240 a share offer is true, ``that proposal would be rejected by
us as too high.''
   The pilots' union hasn't acknowledged receiving the rumored
proposal. The flight attendants said they had gotten it, but
declined comment until it was more thoroughly studied.
   The Tribune said its sources believed the pilots feel the
proposal falls short of some of their demands, including having a
voice in running the company.
   The sources said management increased somewhat the contract
concessions it is seeking from the flight attendants in return for
their participation in an employee stock ownership plan.

<HEAD>Report Says Plants May Shut If Chevy Dealer Orders Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Division has
warned its dealers that unless new car orders pick up, assembly
plants may close, according to an automotive trade journal.
   Automotive News said in Monday's edition that GM issued a
special bulletin to its Chevrolet dealers saying the company
planned to build 90,843 Chevrolets in January, but orders for those
cars as of Nov. 22 stood at 24,130.
   For months, dealers have been faced with large inventories on
which they pay interest and insurance costs. Many have said they
will cut orders for 1990 models.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, another weekly automotive journal,
said in Monday's edition that dealers for the eight major U.S.
automakers had an 88-day supply of new cars on hand at the end of
November, up from supplies of 77 days the month before. GM's
new-car inventory stood at 99 days, Ward's said.
   Earlier this month, GM said Chevrolet sales for the 1990 model
year were 14.1 percent lower than sales at the same time during the
1988 model year.
   ``It is critical that all dealers immediately analyze their
product needs and submit orders immediately,'' Automotive News
quoted the GM bulletin as saying. ``Adequate order banks are
necessary to maintain uninterrupted production.''
   Last week, GM announced temporary shut downs of U.S. and
Canadian assembly plants because of sagging dealer orders. In
March, GM will close its Lakewood, Ga., plant, which makes the
full-size Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Estate Wagon.

   The stock market edged upward today, still
hovering in the narrow range that has prevailed since the beginning
of last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.12 to 2,733.36 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 550 up, 433 down and
557 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.38 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   One apparent plus for the market was a forecast from a group of
corporate purchasing executives that the economy will avert a
recession in 1990, although growth will be only moderate. That
assessment came in the National Association of Purchasing
Management's semiannual forecast.
   However, stocks got little help from the bond market, where
prices and interest rates showed only mixed and small price changes.
   Analysts said many investors were preoccupied with yearend
maneuvering of their portfolios for tax purposes or, in the case of
professional money managers, in preparation for reports to
employers and clients.
   In the blue-chip sector, Philip Morris rose [ to 42{; Exxon
gained \ to 50; International Business Machines was unchanged at
96[, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was steady at 44].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.18 to 193.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .11 at 375.15.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.20 points
to 2,728.24.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by a 5 to 4 margin on the
NYSE, with 833 issues down, 662 up and 482 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 147.13 million shares, against 144.91
million in Friday's session.

   Emerson Electric Co., strengthening its
position as one of the world's leading electric motor makers, today
announced the purchase of Leroy-Somer SA, a French maker of
electric motors, for $460 million.
   The St. Louis-based company also announced the $135 million
purchase of McGill Manufacturing Co., a Valparaiso, Ind., company
that makes bearings and electrical products.
   Emerson, which is also a leading producer of industrial
monitoring equipment, tools and components for appliances, had
annual sales of about $7.1 billion this year.
   ``This is pretty much consistent with their strategy of the last
six years, bringing in smaller firms and improving profitability,''
said Craig Krapf, an analyst for Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. in St.
Louis. ``They've got a knack for that.''
   The Leroy-Somer acquisition, subject to approval by the U.S. and
French regulatory authorities, gives Emerson a chance to increase
its presence in the European Economic Community before 1992, when
the 12-nation bloc becomes a single unified market.
   Emerson already has some electric motor divisions in West
Germany, as well as Mexico.
   Leroy-Somer makes integral and fractional horsepower electric
motors and drives for industrial markets, with manufacturing
facilities primarily in France.
   Emerson said when the deal is finalized, it will sell
Leroy-Somer's King Bearing unit, based in the United States.

<HEAD>Du Pont And Waste Management To Build Plastic Recycling Plant In
Philly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co. and Waste Management of
North America Inc. announced today Philadelphia is the site for a
plastic recycling plant to serve the northeastern United States and
eventually anchor a national network.
   Nicholas Pappas, Du Pont's executive vice president, said the
nation's fifth largest city ``will provide an excellent site for us
to demonstrate that plastic recycling is a vital tool for reducing
the nation's solid waste disposal problem.''
   The Philadelphia plant is expected to be the first link in the
largest recycling system ever, Pappas said. Du Pont is
headquartered in Wilmington, Del., and Waste Management is based in
Oak Brook, Ill.
   Pappas said DuPont and Waste Management expect to announce early
next year the site of a Midwestern plant. Others will be located in
areas where the companies can buy materials from curbside and
deposit programs.
   The Philadelphia plant, which will have an annual capacity of up
to 40 million pounds initially, is scheduled to begin operating in
the spring of 1990 and will employ about 70 people.
   Noting that 60 percent of Philadelphia's neighborhoods already
participate in recycling programs, Pappas said by locating the
facility here, ``we expect to be able to purchase a steady supply
of source material and will have access to viable markets for the
high-value, end-use products Du Pont intends to develop.''
   Pappas said Du Pont expects to use the recycled plastics in the
automotive, consumer and building industries.
   William Hulligan, president of the Waste Management, said ``the
recycling experience and polymer technology possessed by Waste
Management and Du Pont, coupled with public enthusiasm for plastic
recycling will make this a successful venture.''
   The two executives said the joint venture will have a total
capacity of 200 million pounds from trash sources by 1994 and will
provide an integrated recycling system that includes collection,
separation, sorting and reclamation of the plastics.
   Waste Management claims to collect waste from more than 8
million residential and industrial customers in the United States.

   It would cost Scrooge McDuck nearly $100

   A date in the Magic Kingdom for Mickey and Minnie would run more

   Disneyland has boosted one-day admission prices by $2, to $25.50

too, by a dollar to $4.
   For a family foursome, that's $96 to visit Frontierland, up from

   Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said the company raised prices to
offset the costs of its Splash Mountain ride, which opened last
summer.
   The price increases, said Roth, are ``something necessary for us
to do to introduce products like these for our customers.''
   Theme park officials also are anticipating the year-long

<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesday
projected a decline in earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 1990
and said sales would grow more slowly than previously predicted.
   The personal computer maker made its surprise announcement just
two weeks after a top Apple executive told security analysts in New
York that it expected worldwide sales growth of more than 20
percent.
   Apple's stock was off $3.25 a share to $36 in over-the-counter
trading early today.
   Donald P. Casey, vice president of networking and communications
systems, also told the analysts at a personal computing conference
on Nov. 29 that Apple expected sales growth in this country of 15
percent to 18 percent.
   In its announcement Tuesday, Apple said its net sales for the
first quarter of 1990, ending Dec. 29, 1989, will exceed the $1.40
billion for the same quarter in the previous year, but the increase
will be less than it expected.
   The company said it had expected a significant increase in sales
in the quarter, especially with holiday purchases. But, though
Macintosh sales have been strong overall, Apple's sales haven't
increased at the expected rate.
   In addition, Apple said it is having trouble meeting customer
demand for the Macintosh Portable because of constraints in the
supply of the products screen display.
   The revised sales figures, the company said, is likely to drive
earnings below the $1.10 per share level of a year ago.

<TEXT>
   A major Chicago retail-center developer, JMB
Realty Co., has joined the bidding for the high-profile
Bloomingdale's department store chain and Hilton Hotels Corp.,
published reports say.
   Officials at JMB have declined to comment publicly on its
interest in acquiring the 17-store Bloomingdale's chain, the crown
jewel of troubled Campeau Corp.'s retailing empire, but sources
were quoted by the Chicago Tribune as saying a bid had been made.
   Toronto-based Campeau has said only that it had received ``a
number of expressions of interest'' in Bloomingdale's by Friday's
deadline for bids.
   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions
that JMB is one of at least six bidders for all or part of Hilton,
which put itself on the market in May. JMB declined to comment on
that report as well.
   JMB is a privately held corporation with real estate holdings in
Chicago and other major U.S. and Canadian cities worth more than
$20 billion.
   The firm's Chicago landmarks include Water Tower Place and 900
N. Michigan _ retail and commercial developments on the city's
downtown ``Magnificent Mile,'' its glitziest shopping district.
Bloomingdale's Chicago store is in the 900 N. Michigan building.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that JMB, Bahrain-based
investment bank Investcorp International, Bloomingdale's Chairman
Marvin Traub and Ann Taylor Inc. Chairman Joseph Brooks made offers
for Bloomingdale's.
   Other possible bidders include such established retail companies
as Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. and May Co. of St. Louis,
which have declined comment on their possible interest in the
chain, the Tribune said in today's editions.
   Campeau has said it expects to pare the list ``to no more than
five or six finalists'' who will receive more detailed information
in preparation for the sale, expected to be completed by February.
   JMB won't comment on how much it has offered for the chain,
estimated recently to be priced from $1 billion to $1.3 billion,
nor how much it would be willing to pay.
   ``It's just a bid at this point,'' one unidentified source told
the Tribune. ``If successful, however, it would put the firm in an
area (retailing) that up until now it has not been involved in a
big way.''
   Bloomingdale's went up for sale in September after Campeau said
it was being forced to restructure under the weight of $8 billion
in debt from the 1988 acquisition of Federated Department Stores,
including Bloomingdale's, and the 1986 acquisition of Allied Stores.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting slack
foreign demand for U.S. corn and weaker European markets for
soybean oil and meal.
   A weekly Agriculture Department report on Monday showed a
lower-than-expected amount of corn inspected for export last week.
   Besides lower values overseas for soybean products, prices fell
on news of substantial planting progress in Brazil, a leading
producer.
   The wheat market gave up a portion of the moderate gains it had
tallied Monday in anticipation of expanded grain sales to the
Soviet Union.
   ``The market's just waiting for some export business,'' said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. ``We factored in a good deal of it yesterday and now we're
just waiting for it to be realized.''
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.12{ a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.33{ a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.43{ a bushel;

   The economy will steer clear of a recession next
year but only grow moderately, the nation's purchasing managers
predicted today.
   Although a recession isn't forecast, more corporate purchasing
executives are worried about economic conditions than ever before
in the 27 years the National Association of Purchasing Management
has asked its members to say how they feel about the future.
   ``The exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in
1990 is overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth, albeit
moderate,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's
business survey committee.
   Corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they
must make spending decisions based on assumptions about how
business will be, how much inflation will erode buying power and
other factors.
   The organization's semiannual forecast, released at a news
conference, said 64 percent of the members expect business to be
better rather than worse in 1990 than in 1989.
   Economic growth will average 5 percent next year, before
adjusting for inflation, with the second half of the year improving
from a weak first six months. Rising capital expenditures,
expanding exports and slowing imports will contribute to the
increase in economic output.
   Inflation will continue easing next year after turning out to be
milder than previously expected in 1989.
   Purchasers said their prices increased an average of 2.6 percent
in 1989, sharply lower than the 5 percent reported for 1988 and
less than the 3.7 percent increase originally predicted for 1989.
   Next year's inflation numbers also look tame. Prices are
predicted to rise an average of 1.6 percent.
   ``Clearly this projects a continuing moderating trend in the
rate of inflation,'' Bretz, director of materials management at
Pitney Bowes Inc., said at the news conference at a New York hotel.
   Ample supplies and reduced demand are restraining inflation,
Bretz said.
   Turning to the overall outlook for the next 12 months, 64
percent of the purchasers expressed concern, up from 57 percent
when the last survey was taken in May and the highest proportion in
the past 27 years.
   Only 31 percent of the purchasers said they were satisfied or
optimistic about next year, down from 42 percent in May and 48
percent a year ago. This was the least to express this view since
September 1981 when the economy was mired in a recession.
   The purchasers' group gathers information for its twice yearly
reports from replies to questions asked of purchasing executives in
more than 300 industrial companies all over the country.
   Today's was the 38th semiannual forecast to be issued by the
Tempe, Ariz.-based organization.

<HEAD>Say Going Public Helps Corporate Performance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Companies that raise capital through initial
public stock offerings have a faster growth rate than companies in
general, says a study financed by the organization that runs the
over-the-counter stock market.
   Two researchers at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, Professor Glenn Yago and assistant Jeff Yanenbaum, compared
the performance of 426 companies making initial public offerings
(IPOs) from 1943 to 1985 with companies in their industry, as well
as industry averages.
   ``We found that going public tends to have a profound effect on
corporate performance,'' said the study's authors, who are with
Stony Brook's W. Averell Harriman School for Managament and Policy.
   The study, funded and released Monday by the Washington-based
National Association of Securities Dealers, compared the
performance of companies making IPOs and their respective industry
in several key areas: employment, revenues, sales per employee,
capital investment, capital spending, working capital, net fixed
assets and total assets.
   But because of ``certain data limitations, information on some
of our variables was not available for all IPOs in our study,'' the
28-page study explained in its methodology section.
   ``Still, we were able to examine at least 268 IPOs for each
variable, and in some cases considerably more,'' it continued.
   ``In each of th areas we examined, IPO firms outpaced their
industries by a considerable margin,'' Yago and Tanenbaum said.
``In a period when corporate industry as a whole was losing jobs,
the IPO firms showed substantial employment gains. In other
variables we examined, IPO firms grew from 2.5 to nearly 17 times
faster than did companies in general.''
   NASD, which operates the NASDAQ stock quotation system, is a
self-regulatory organization that oversees stocks nor listed on
stock exchanges, the over-the-counter market.
   All of the companies studied were listed on NASDAQ. According to
the NASD, more than 85 percent of all initial public offerings
brought to market during the past five years were listed on NASDAQ.

<HEAD>End of Profits Decline?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the stock market seems unable to make up its
mind you can attribute it to confusion about the future of
corporate profits, which have been declining for a full year.
   Based on the vast range of opinions from executives and stock
analysts, next year can mean an end to the profits recession, a
rebound, a continuation or even a worsening.
   The outlook is that varied, clouded by unusual uncertainties,
the chief of them seeming to be a gut feeling that an economy
entering its eighth straight year of expansion is bound to need a
rest.
   Of only slightly less concern seems to be difficiulty in
comprehending the relaxation of world tensions, the probability of
declines in defense spending and the chances of greater trade with
Europe and China.
   A survey of 1,500 business executives by Dun &amp; Bradstreet in
August showed expectations for higher sales and profits had dropped
to the lowest levels in four years for the current quarter, but
gave no indication beyond that.
   However, the depth of the feelings revealed in that survey, and
the fact that profit expectations had been dropping throughout the
year, make unlikely the possibility of a sudden turnabout in
corporate confidence.
   That survey showed retailer expections for sales-profits gains
were at their lowest since the fourth quarter of 1983, and that
combined retailer-wholesaler-manufacturer profit expectations were
at the lowest since 1985.
   The profit erosion began very late in 1988 and worsened
throughout the past year. A survey of 1989 third-quarter results by
the Wall Street Journal showed a 21 percent drop, and one by
Business Week showed a 22 percent decline.
   While such a record suggests no quick turnaround, the outlook is
viewed quite optimistically by some investment analysts.
   Zacks Investment Research, which collects earnings predictions
from 2,000 analysts and compiles a consensus forecast, contends
that median profit growth should be 12.9 percent in 1990,
surpassing 1989's expected 9.6 percent rise.
   Financial analysts, however, have been known to be wrong, so
Financial World magazine, which published the research, wisely
asked Zacks to make a breakdown into three groups: Companies that
surpass Wall Street expectations, those that come closest to
matching analyst estimates, and companies that often earn less than
forecast.
   It suggested that readers be wary of stocks that regularly
surprise analysts.
   While concerned about the profits shrinkage, Edward Yardeni,
director of economics for Prudential-Bache Securities, believes
worries might be overdone. He feels the profits decline has about
reached bottom.
   ``Odds are that the worst of the year-over-year comparisons will
occur during the fourth quarter of this year,'' Yardeni recently
told that firm's clients. He said comparisons should turn positive
by the 1990 second quarter.
   Still another unknown draws questions. Wright Investors Service
calls attention to a surprise factor that seems to play a prominent
role of late in the affairs of profit-seeking enterprises.
   ``Unusual charges and writeoffs have increasingly become a
regular feature of fourth-quarter earnings reports,'' it said.
Companies have been forced into costly restructurings, and banks
have had to write off uncollectable loans.
   While such events can to some extent be anticipated, total
surprises, such as Union Carbide's deadly gas leak in Bhopal,
India, and Exxon's nearly $2 billion oil spill in Alaska, also tend
to unnerve investors.

   Stocks rose in heavy volume Tuesday, reflecting a
strong response to the debut of trading in Britain's privatized
water companies.
   The 10 English and Welsh water companies began their first
trading day well above the 30 percent premium than many market
participants had expected.
   The government sold 2.183 million shares for 240 pence or about
$3.84 each in the $8.4 billion privatization. Trading in water
shares dominated the day, as well as the market's total volume.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 12.1
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,363.5. The Financial Times
30-share index was up 9.7 points at 1,861.5 at the close. The
Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.24 points to close at
1,283.79.
   Volume totaled 800.4 million shares, with trading in the water
companies accounting for about 433 million shares of the total. On
Monday, volume totaled 349.5 million shares.

   A wife gives her husband a pricey gold watch for Christmas and
he splurges on a diamond pendant for her.
   But just after the new year their home is burglarized and both
gifts become ghosts of Christmas past, because neither was
adequately insured.
   Insurance companies often paint such gloomy scenarios to help
drum up more business and some have been doing a lot of it with
concerted media campaigns during the current holiday buying season.
   For many consumers, a little extra insurance can protect valued
gifts and provide peace of mind _ but experts say coverage and
costs vary significanlty between companies and states.
   ``Don't buy the first policy that someone tries to sell you,''
says Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Washington-based
Consumer Federation of America.
   Brobeck urges consumers to first check their homeowner or tenant
insurance policies to see what's covered. If an item in question is
valuable enough to be insured separately, they should shop around
for the best rates, he said.
   Other coverage may be available from credit card companies.
American Express, for example, automatically insures goods bought
with its cards for up to 90 days. Visa and MasterCard extend such
coverage to holders of their premium gold and platinum cards.
   Most standard homeowner or tenant policies provide limited
coverage of valuables from a wide assortment of what insurers call
``perils,'' which usually include theft, fire, or wind damage, but
not loss due to one's own negligence.
   For example, standard policies likely will insure all jewelry in
your home, including watches, precious or semi-precious stones, for
a total of up to $1,000. Coverage for silver and goldware generally
is capped at $2,500.
   Consumers can get extra coverage by purchasing ``floaters,'' or
``riders,'' that are attached to their regular policies.
   Rates vary from state to state, and even from one part of town
to the next.
   The average cost of insuring a piece of jewelry in South Dakota,
for instance, is 80 cents per $100 of appraised value. Insurance on
that same item in Brooklyn, New York, would cost $4.50 per $100,
but in nearby Manhattan it costs around $1.30, according to the New
York-based trade group Insurance Information Institute.
   Insurance premiums also vary depending on whether the appraised
pieces are classified as ``scheduled'' or ``unscheduled,'' and
whether the policy offers ``agreed value'' or ``actual cash value''
coverage, said Arlene LaGrassa, vice president of Kornreich
Insurance Services in New York.
   Scheduled coverage pays off on an item no matter how it's lost,
but with unscheduled property collection is possible only if the
item is stolen or destroyed in a fire, she said.
   Agreed value coverage means that at the time of collection the
insured will receive the full amount for which the item is insured,
while the actual cash value takes depreciation into account,
allowing the policyholder to collect a replacement of equal value
or an amount that may be less than current market value, she said.
   Neither, however, accounts for appreciation, so a policyholder
eventually could end up paying more to update coverage.
   ``A sophisticated broker recognizes when diamonds or gold are
changing in value and ... review schedules and policies with you,''
said John Karanik, a senior vice president for Atlantic Mutual
Insurance Co. in New York.
   But Brobeck sees other alternatives. ``One strategy that people
might want to take is to spend the money they would have spent on
insurance on improving their home security, such as adding wall
safes,'' he said. ``Bank safe deposit boxes also are much cheaper.''

<HEAD>Butcher Proposes Trade Certificate Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp.'s chairman says the
enormous U.S. trade deficit could be reduced if the United States
forced foreign nations to essentially buy a dollar worth of U.S.
goods for each dollar worth they wanted to sell here.
   In a speech prepared for delivery Tuesday before the World Trade
Council of Orange County, Calif., Willard C. Butcher outlined a
plan under which ``trade certificates'' would be issued to
importers of U.S.-made goods.
   Each certificate would be worth the value of the purchased
goods, he said.
   Foreigners shipping products into the United States would be
required to supply the certificates having the face value of their
goods. Butcher said the certificates also could trade on the open
market.
   Butcher said the plan could be phased in over a four-year
period, initially at ratios that reflect current trade imbalances.
For example, he said, foreign exporters initially might be required
only to submit $75 or $80 worth of certificates in order to sell
$100 worth of goods to the United States, with the ratio increasing
over time.
   He said his plan would not be a form of protectionism.
   ``Trade certificates would neither favor, nor discriminate
against, any industry, shipper, product or country,'' Butcher said.
``They would end up promoting trade, since the more goods that are
shipped from the United States, the more that can be shipped to the
United States.''
   The nation's trade deficit totaled $27.75 billion in the third
quarter, up slightly from $27.55 billion in the previous quarter.
   Chase is the nation's second largest bank holding company with
assets of around $100 billion.

   The White House said today President Bush has
no plans to ask Congress for more money to close failed savings and
loan institutions, despite his remark a day earlier that recent
legislation may not provide enough.
   ``It's a whale of a mess, and we'll see where we go,'' Bush said
Monday, speaking to a group of editorial writers. ``We've had this
one refinancing. I am now told that that might not be enough.''
   However, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said today
that the president ``was not signaling any effort on our part to
come up with new legislation.''
   Fitzwater said the president's remarks were more of a suggestion
that there was a short-term budget crunch which would make it
difficult for the government to close as many S&amp;Ls as it needs to.
   Legislation signed Aug. 9 by Bush authorized the government to
borrow $50 billion through September 1991 to protect depositors at
insolvent S&amp;Ls _ a package larger than the rescues for the Chrysler
Corp., Lockheed Aircraft Corp., New York City and the Marshall Plan
combined.
   ``Only four months after the bill's been signed, he's talking
about more money. That's pretty amazing,'' said economist Robert
Litan of the Brookings Institution.
   Bush's comment drew immediate criticism in Congress, where a key
Democrat said the administration wasn't effectively spending the
money it already has provided.
   ``I and others are not just going to throw money at this,'' said
Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House task force
overseeing the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``We want to see some results. He should use the harpoon in his
hand rather than ask for more money. He's had this bill for four
months and quite frankly little has been done,'' Vento said.
   Private analysts have maintained for months, even before the
bailout bill passed Congress, that $50 billion was inadequate and
that the administration would have to ask taxpayers for more.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., warned in October that it was possible the $50 billion would
``prove to be insufficient.'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
said then that nothing had occurred since the bill's passage to
change the administration's estimate.
   Bush's statement is the first indication from him that the
administration may be rethinking the adequacy of the original
package.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency charged with
the bailout, has taken over 313 S&amp;Ls and is expecting to take over
as many as 200 more.
   The agency has spent $10 billion disposing of 33 institutions.
It hopes to recover some of the money by selling the real estate
and loan portfolios of the institutions.

currencies in European trading Tuesday under pressure from the
strong West German mark.
   Gold prices rose.
   Trading was dominated by strong demand for marks against all
other currencies. A robust economy and a perception that West
Germany will benefit from the changes in Eastern Europe have stoked
that demand, dealers said.
   ``No one is brave enough to buck this trend. Everyone is
sticking with marks,'' said one trader in London.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 1.7335 marks, off from 1.7660
marks late Monday and the lowest level in 1989.
   The British pound rose to $1.6027 from $1.5895 late.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.18 yen to close at 144.47 yen. Later in
London, it dropped to 143.80 yen.
   The dollar dipped below 6.00 French francs for the first time
since Dec. 16, 1988, finishing at 5.9275 francs, down from 6.0370
francs late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.5765 Swiss francs, down from 1.5970; 1.9715 Dutch guilders, down
from 1.9950; 1,285.75 Italian lire, down from 1,304.25; and 1.1625
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1632.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $417.50 a troy ounce,
up from $416.75 Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $416.75
an ounce, up $1.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up $4.40 at $416.95 an ounce.
   Silver traded in London at a late bid price of $5.70 a troy
ounce, down from $5.74 Monday.

   Toy trains, which have chugged around so
many Christmas trees in years past, are coming `round again this
year.
   After being eclipsed by video games at the beginning of the
decade, sales are up for train sets, according to manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers.
   Some see it as a return to more traditional toys by both
children and parents, while others say buyers are attracted by such
modern versions as remote-controlled trains and sets featuring
miniature video cameras.
   ``Our business is going crazy. We're so far behind with orders,
it's unbelievable,'' said Ron Moyer, vice president at
International Hobby Corp. in Philadelphia, which distributes model
trains, accessories and building kits. ``We're working six days a
week, extra hours each day.''
   Moyer estimates International's sales are up 40 percent over
last year.
   ``A lot of people are bringing out their old train sets they had
for years and they're going to hobby stores to get the layouts
going again,'' he said.
   Orders also are up about 40 percent at Bachman Industries, Inc.,
according to Dick Maddox, vice president for sales and marketing.
   Bachman, supplied by factories in China, advised retailers this
fall that political unrest there and a fire at a factory in
Thailand caused shipping delays.
   But Maddox says demand remains strong, ``...and we still haven't
hit the hottest time for train sales, the last two weeks before
Christmas.''
   Dan Perkins, national sales manager for Global Hobby
Distributors in Fountain Valley, Calif., said he believes many
people are buying trains at his Hobby Shack retail chain for the
same reason he bought one.
   ``You have a generation of children who grew up with trains who
are now adults,'' he said. ``And they want trains for their kids.
Plus, the manufacturers are back in the swing again after a pretty
bad shakeout a few years ago. ...Sales are up 20 to 30 percent over
last year, and last year was a growth year.''
   Bachman took aim at a new market this year with its ``Big
Hauler'' sets, trains built to the extra-large ``G'' scale, about
twice the size of yesteryear's toy trains.
   Maddox estimates his company will sell $15 million worth of the
big trains this year and he thinks he had to turn away as much as
$10 million in orders.
   ``It will never never replace HO scale trains as a hobby, but it
will become the standard for those who want to set up trains under
the tree as part of the tradition,'' he said. ``Little kids can
play with it. It's big enough for them to handle it.''
   In Moorestown, N.J., manufacturer Tyco also is having a banner
year. Company spokesman Bruce Maguire said trains are doing well
because of the same type of nostalgia buying that has made some of
the company's dolls successful this year.
   ``Among the more popular dolls that are making comebacks are
dolls that mothers had when they were girls,'' he said. ``They are
now buying them for their kids.''
   Prices of train sets vary widely. Advertising circulars for the
``Toys `R Us'' chain last week showed train sets from $24.99 to
$199.99. Serious hobbyists can spend hundreds of dollars on a
single locomotive.
   ``In general, basic is what sells,'' Maguire said. ``Good old
American train sets, good old dolls. They're going to sell year in
and year out. Kids stil want them and parents still want their kids
to have them.''
   Art Peisner, president of Lionel, said there are few reliable
statistics for the industry but he believed sales were higher now
than in decades. Lionel train sales are up ``significantly,
certainly double-digit'' this year, he said.
   Lionel _ which markets a locomotive equipped with a video camera
_ has introduced oversize ``G'' gauge and collector-oriented
standard gauge trains. But Peisner says the company's biggest
success remains the mass marketing of train sets, complete with
track and electric transformer.
   ``The focus of our advertising is many adults _ what some people
would refer to as yuppies _ who have children now of age who are
potentially interested in trains,'' Peisner said.
   ``We're trying to remind them of the wonderful times they had
when they were kids, playing with their trains and more importantly
playing with their fathers. Now, we're advising them to enjoy the
experience from the other end with their sons _ or their
daughters.''
   Peisner estimates the train industry's share of the roughly
$12.5 billion retail toy market is about $300 million. Video games
such as the popular Nintendo account for several billion dollars on
top of the overall market and Peisner has no illusions that trains
someday will take the lion's share of the market.
   ``No, I think train sets are an important and growing set of the
toy market, but trains are not an everyday part of a kid's life
today, they way they were back in the 50s,'' he said.

<HEAD>Accuse Memphis Cotton Merchant of Missing Margin Call</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit accusing The Julien Co. of
failing to meet a $4.35 million margin call on the New York Cotton
Exchange claims the leading cotton merchant is in financial trouble.
   Julien Hohenberg, founder and president of the Memphis company,
was unavailable for comment Tuesday at his office or residence.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday by PainWebber Inc., says The Julien
Co. failed to meet the margin call on Dec. 8, one day after a
similar call for $2 million.
   PaineWebber said it froze The Julien Co.'s account but was left
with a shortfall of $2.3 million.
   The lawsuit follows last week's sharp drop in cotton prices, and
market observers say that may have been partly caused by a major
merchant selling holdings to meet a margin call.
   ``Until this past week, The Julien Co. has always been very
prompt in satisfying margin calls,'' said the lawsuit, filed in
Shelby County Chancery Court.
   Brokers often allow a customer to trade on credit but if prices
fall below the customer's collateral he can be asked to meet that
margin by coming up with additional money.
   The Shelby County court issued orders barring The Julien Co.
from disposing of its assets, other than what is necessary in the
ordinary course of business.
   ``PaineWebber alleges upon information and belief that The
Julien Co. has recently incurred other substantial liabilities in
addition to its liabilities to PaineWebber,'' the lawsuit says.
   Industry observers say cotton prices have been low even though
the nation's cotton surplus is relatively small. Cutbacks in
purchases by textile mills and a large domestic cotton crop this
year may have attributed to that market sluggishness, the observers
say.
   The Julien Co. is a leading cotton merchant. Memphis has been a
center of cotton trade since Mississippi River paddlewheelers
brought in cotton from plantations throughout the Delta, and Julien
Hohenberg's family has been in the business since 1879.
   His family's business, Hohenberg Bros., was sold to Cargill,
Inc., in 1975 and became that company's cotton subsidiary.
Hohenberg, who had been president of the family business since
1961, continued to run Hohenberg Bros. until 1985 when he retired
and formed The Julien Co.

   The stock market was mixed in moderate trading
today with blue-chip issues outperforming the rest of the field.
   At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was up 4.27 to 2,732.51.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 723 up, 733 down and
504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 115.48 million shares with two
hours to go.
   ``The big blue-chip names are OK,'' said Ralph J. Acampora,
technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``It's under the
surface where the deterioration is.''
   Traders said the market generally was biding time until the
release on Friday of reports on the producer price index for
November and the October trade deficit. Friday also brings
expiration of stock-index futures and options.
   One apparent boost was the semiannual forecast by the National
Association of Purchasing Management that the economy would avert a
recession in 1990, although growth was expected to be only moderate.
   In the national over-the-counter market, Apple Computer was down
3 to 36\ in heavy trading. The company projected an earnings
decline and slowing sales growth for the first quarter of fiscal
1990.
   The announcement dragged down other technology issues, as well
as the broader over-the-counter market.
   Among other computer issues, Intel was down ] to 32, Compaq fell
1 to 80| after a weak earnings forecast, International Business
Machines was unchanged at 96[, Hewlett-Packard down { to 45\,
National Semiconductor down \ to 6} and Digital Equipment down [ to
83~.
   Among heavily traded Big Board stocks, Phillips Petroleum gained
1] to 25~ after announcing a major stock buyback Monday; Exxon
gained | to 50]; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up { to 44~,
one day after announcing job cuts that could total more than 30,000.
   Land's End slipped 2| to 21[ after reporting it expects fiscal
year earnings to be 13 percent lower than a year earlier. The
mail-order retailer tumbled 4| Monday after the announcement.
   Energy issues fared well as cold weather arrived in many parts
of the country. Atlantic Richfield was up 1} to 111}, Mobil traded
1\ higher to 62| and Pennzoil gained 1 to 87\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.45 to 193.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .73 at 375.77.

<HEAD>Brokerage Firms Bearish on Economy, Stocks for 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s economic forecast
for 1990 is titled ``What If Bear Market?'' and features a teddy
bear on its cover. Not surprisingly, the firm predicts a recession
next year.
   Drexel is not alone. Pessimism is the New Year's message from
Wall Street, with major brokerages forecasting an economic downturn
and some an outright recession.
   In their annual year-ahead forecasts, the firms that engineer
multibillion-dollar deals and advise individual investors whether
to buy stock in Coke or Pepsi aren't in total agreement, but none
is optimistic.
   The consensus view of Wall Street's seers is that slow economic
growth, a weak dollar overseas and slumping corporate profits will
combine to retard the economy and the stock market at the start of
the new decade.
   ``After an eight-year run reflecting a seven-year economic
expansion, my view is there ain't much out there that is
unexploited,'' Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. chief investment strategist
Stefan Abrams said. ``We've had a long time to rotate everybody
into one dance.''
   Kidder predicts very slow economic growth in the range of 1
percent but not a ``dictionary definition'' of a recession, which
is economic shrinkage. The firm's inflation estimates vary from
just over 3 percent to over 4 percent, on the low side of Wall
Street expectations.
   Abrams said a key issue will be wage and employment pressures
and that more job cuts such as the recent 10,000 announced by IBM
and more than 30,000 expected at AT&amp;T could provoke a full-scale
recession.
   Economists are in agreement about groups of stocks that will do
well in 1990: growth companies in areas such as pharmaceuticals and
beverages, and recent ``fallen angels'' such as Anheuser-Busch Cos.
Inc. or Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   Abby Joseph Cohen, Drexel's chief investment strategist,
predicts that corporate profits will decline to $22.50 per share
for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index, significantly lower than
other firms' predictions in the $25 range.
   ``We believe that profits have already peaked and that consensus
expectations are too high,'' Cohen writes in Drexel's 206-page
forecast released Tuesday.
   Drexel's recommendation: Buy stocks in companies whose earnings
and revenues are not likely to be harmed by an economic slowdown or
recession, such as soft drinks (the firm recommends Pepsico over
Coca-Cola Co.), pharmaceuticals such as Pfizer Inc. and emerging
industries, such as biotechnology's Genentech Inc.
   Also contributing to a recession, Drexel says, is a declining
money flow due to factors such as bearish foreign sentiment on the
dollar, weakness in domestic demand for goods, lower corporate
profits and soft real estate prices. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the
largest Wall Street firm, is slightly more sanguine. ``We should
escape a full-fledged recession, but it may be a close call,''
chief economist Donald H. Straszheim wrote last week.
   Returns on stocks should be below average next year, Merrill
predicted, with a change in market leadership to capital goods and
energy stocks from consumer and financial issues. Its
recommendation: companies offering growth potential.
   PaineWebber Inc. chief economist Edward M. Kerschner was the
most chipper of his peers, saying in a ``Happy New Year!'' memo to
staffers that ``before spring, lower interest rates and the outlook
for upturn in the economy could be fuel for the next leg of the
bull market.''
   Kerschner predicted the stock market could end 1990 10 percent
to 15 percent higher than at the start.
   He also sees interest rates heading lower next year, with a
prime rate falling to 9 percent from the current 10.5 percent. But
Greg A. Smith, investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., throws water on a lower interest rate scenario with a
positive economic outlook.
   ``While the economy is showing some signs of softness,
particularly in auto sales, and while capital spending is slowing,
I do not really see widespread weakness nor even that the weak
areas are getting weaker,'' he writes.
   The rapidly changing political situation in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was a wild card cited by several economists. The
Soviet Union needs Western technology to rebuild its economy, they
said, and faster growth in Poland, East Germany, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia could benefit the U.S. economy.
   Some economists say bonds should benefit because lower U.S.
defense spending should reduce the federal deficit, and therefore
reduce interest rates, while stocks should gain based on both lower
interest rates and faster global growth.
   ``It's all very bullish for bonds and stocks _ as long as
perestroika continues,'' Kerschner wrote, referring to Soviet
political and economic restructuring.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Tuesday in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as
players waited for any news of export sales.
   Corn futures were pressured by a weekly Agriculture Department
report showing a lower-than-expected amount of corn inspected for
export last week.
   With bitter cold temperatures freezing shipping waterways in the
Midwest and Northeast, fears of a further export slowdown prompted
additional selling of grain futures.
   Lower European values for soybean products weighed on soybean
prices, as did news of substantial planting progress in Brazil, the
world's second-largest soybean producer.
   Wheat futures ended mostly higher, extending the gains tallied
Monday in anticipation of expanded grain sales to the Soviet Union.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1 cent higher

<HEAD>Next Year's Economic Growth Seen Moderate, But Optimism Fades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Purchasing managers of the nation's corporations
think the economy will avoid a recession next year but optimism has
ebbed to the lowest level since the early 1980s, according to a
forecast released Thursday.
   The economy will be weak in the first half of 1990 and improve
during the remainder of the year, producing moderate growth
overall, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
semiannual forecast said.
   Inflation will ease further next year and should finish this
year milder than previously expected.
   Although a recession isn't forecast, more corporate purchasing
executives have indicated concern about economic conditions now
than ever before in the 27 years hhe association has asked its
members how they feel about the future.
   And fewer purchasers are optimistic than at any time since
September 1981 _when the economy was struggling in a recession.
   ``The exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in
1990 is overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth, albeit
moderate,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's
business survey committee.
   ``The basis for believing a recession will be averted and minor
growth achieved is the view that both exports and capital
expenditures will continue to be relatively strong against a
backdrop of a sharply lower rate of inflation,'' Bretz said.
   The threat of a recession or a severe slowdown heads the list of
concerns expressed by the purchasing managers. High labor and
benefit costs were the second most-mentioned worry, followed by
rising interest rates.
   Corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they
must make spending decisions based on such assumptions as how
business will be, how much inflation will erode buying power,
whether the cost of borrowing money will rise.
   The association's forecast, released at a news conference, said
64 percent of the members expect business to be better rather than
worse in 1990 than in 1989.
   Economic growth will average 5 percent next year, before
adjusting for inflation, with the second half of the year improving
from a weak first six months. Rising capital expenditures,
expanding exports and slowing imports will contribute to the
increase in economic output.
   Inflation will continue easing next year after registering lower
readings than expected in 1989, the forecast indicated. Purchasers
said their prices increased an average of 2.6 percent in 1989, down
from the 3.7 percent increase originally predicted for the year and
from the 5 percent reported for 1988.
   Next year, prices were predicted to rise an average of just 1.6
percent.
   ``Clearly this projects a continuing moderating trend in the
rate of inflation,'' Bretz, director of materials management at
Pitney Bowes Inc., said at the news conference.
   Ample supplies and reduced demand are keeping inflation in
check, Bretz said.
   For the overall outlook for the next 12 months, 64 percent of
the purchasers expressed concern. That was up from 57 percent when
the last survey was taken in May and the highest proportion in the
27 years the association has been asking its members to say whether
they feel ``worried-pessimistic,'' ``concerned'' or
``satisfied-optimistic.''
   Only 31 percent of the purchasers said they were satisfied or
optimistic about next year, down from 42 percent in May and 48
percent a year ago. That was the smallest percentage to express
that view since September 1981.
   The purchasers' group gathers information for its semiannual
reports from responses to questions put to purchasing executives in
more than 300 industrial companies nationwide.
   The Tempe, Ariz.-based group also does monthly reports on
business. The November report showed the manufacturing side of the
economy continued to decline for the seventh straight month.

   The stock market shot higher late today as oil
stocks led an afternoon rally.
   At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was up 15.15 to 2,743.39.
   Advances outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 810 up, 673 down and 509

   Analysts said large block purchases of oil company stocks pushed
the market above the narrow trading ranges that characterized the
earlier part of the day, when the Dow was up slightly but losers
outpaced gainers.
   ``It looks like a pretty big rush to the plate with oils,'' said
Eugene Peroni of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``I
think there's a perception that oil prices are going to be moving
higher next year.''
   Phillips Petroleum and Exxon were the two most actively traded
Big Board stocks, with Phillips up 1{ to 26 and Exxon up 1\ to 51.
Among other oil issues, Pennzoil gained 1] to 87|, Royal Dutch
Petroleum was up 3{ to 77, Mobil increased 1| to 63, Texaco gained

   A sobbing Leona Helmsley was sentenced today to
four years in prison and fined $7.1 million by a judge who said
``naked greed'' prompted her to evade income taxes by billing her
hotel empire for personal items.
   ``No person, no matter how wealthy and prominent, stands above
the law,'' said U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. told the
notoriously picky and sharp-tongued executive.
   ``Your conduct was a product of naked greed ... You believed you
were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition,'' Walker
said.
   Walker also imposed 750 hours of community service at Hale
House, a home for infants born addicted to drugs, three years
probation and repayment of close to $2 million in unpaid taxes.
   He ordered the 69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley, who moments earlier
tearfully pleaded for mercy, to pay the costs incurred by the
federal probe and prosecution of the charges. Walker allowed Mrs.
Helmsley to remain free on an unspecified bail pending appeal.
   Mrs. Helmsley, her 80-year-old husband Harry seated three rows
away, was wracked with sobs as she told Walker, ``I'm more
humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine.''
   ``I am guilty of a serious crime. I feel like I'm in the middle
of a nightmare,'' she said.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she and her husband had been virtual
prisoners in their home for the past three years and said the media
had ripped open the grave of her late son during their coverage of
the trial.
   ``I beg you, don't let me lose Harry, too,'' she said, sobbing,
her cheeks flushed and stained with tears. ``Our whole life has
been work and each other. Please don't. We have nothing else.''
   Her attorney, Gerald Feffer, told Walker earlier that his client
had become a ``lightning rod'' for hate mail, death threats and
anti-Semitic remarks.
   ``She has been ridiculed, abused and humiliated in an
unprecedented way, having nothing to do with her wrongdoing,''
Feffer said.
   Two former Helmsley executives were also sentenced. Co-defendant
Joseph Licari received 30 months in prison, three years probation
and a $75,000 fine. Co-defendant Frank Turco received a two-year
term, three years probation and a $50,000 fine.
   Mrs. Helmsley was found guilty of evading federal taxes from
1983 through 1985, most of it by fraudulently billing $3.1 million
in expenses from the Helmsleys' Greenwich, Conn., mansion, Dunellen
Hall, to their $5 billion real estate empire.
   Among the expenses were more than $1 million for a pool
enclosure with a marble dance floor; jade figures worth $500,000,
and a $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system. Other personal expenses
included groceries and $8 in underwear.
   The Helmsleys have extensive real estate holdings and own 27
hotels. Helmsley was indicted along with his wife but found
mentally incompetent to stand trial.
   In magazine ads that are still published, Mrs. Helmsley is
portrayed as the ``queen'' of the Helmsley luxury hotels, a regal
perfectionist with an eagle eye for the slightest thing out of
place.
   In court, she was depicted as an abusive, penny-pinching tyrant
_ part of a defense strategy of arguing that the phony billing
scheme was orchestrated by employees to avoid contact with Mrs.
Helmsley, who was labeled by her own lawyer, Gerald Feffer, as a
``tough bitch.''
   According to testimony, Mrs. Helmsley ordered that bottles be
returned for the nickel deposit and once told her housekeeper, ``We
don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''
   Feffer had argued the Helmsleys did nothing wrong in billing
their companies for part of their household expenses because they
used the estate for business.

<HEAD>Dollar Off On Mark's Strength; Gold Up</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Precedes LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's mark dominated foreign exchange
trading Tuesday, strengthening on firm interest rates in that
country and talk of a reunified Germany that helped sharply depress
the dollar and other currencies. In both New York and Europe, the
dollar hit a one-year low against the mark, traders said.
   ``The scenario here is that interest rates in Germany will stay
firm ... while U.S. rates are trending down because the economy is
slowing,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a currency trader at Harris Trust
&amp; Co. in Chicago.
   ``It's not so much the dollar's weakness as it is the mark's
strength. The mark is the place to be right now.''
   The mark has risen sharply in recent weeks amid rapid political
and economic reforms in East Germany. Traders speculate that West
Germany's economy will flourish, pushing interest rates higher, as
boundaries between east and west diminish.
   High interest rates tend to support a currency.
   The dollar was quoted in London at 1.7335 marks, off from 1.7660
marks late Monday, and in New York at 1.73225 marks, down from
1.7610. Both closing rates were the lowest since December 1988,
according to traders.
   The dollar also dipped below 6.00 French francs for the first
time since Dec. 16, 1988, finishing at 5.9275 francs in Europe,
down from 6.0370 francs late Monday. It finished at 5.9185 francs
in New York, down from 6.0200.
   Against the British pound the dollar also weakened. Sterling
rose to $1.6027 from $1.5895 in London late Monday, and $1.6085
from $1.5937 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.5732 Swiss francs, down from 1.5915; 1,284.75
Italian lire, down from 1,301.00; and 1.16255 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.16375.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.5765 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5970; 1.9715 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9950;
1,285.75 Italian lire, down from 1,304.25; and 1.1625 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1632.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.18 yen to close at 144.47 yen. It traded
at 143.80 yen in London, and 143.975 yen in New York, down from
144.375 Monday.
   Meanwhile, gold prices rose here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $417.90 a troy ounce, up $1.10 from Monday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$417 an ounce, up 60 cents.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $417.50 an ounce
from $416.75 Monday. Gold closed in Zurich at $416.75 an ounce, up
$1.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.40 at $416.95 an ounce.
   But silver prices slipped. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.672 a troy ounce, down from
$5.692. In London, the late bid for silver was $5.70 an ounce, down
4 cents.

<BYLINE>Cotton Crop Shrinks From Last Year</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 cotton crop is expected to be
slightly less than 12.1 million bales, down 22 percent from last
year's harvest but virtually the same as estimated in November, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   In its new estimate based on field conditions as of Dec. 1, the
department's National Agricultural Statistics Service said a 20
percent drop in the acreage for harvest and slightly lower yields
account for the decline from 1988 levels.
   ``The Delta states experienced favorable weather during harvest
and show and increase from last month,'' the report said. ``In
Texas, an October freeze lowered expected yields.''
   Orange production was forecast at 194 million boxes, unchanged
from the previous forecast two months ago based on Oct. 1
indications but 6 percent below last season.
   ``This decline is due mostly to Florida's 11 percent decrease
from last season,'' the report said. ``Freezing weather in Florida
during late February killed some of the open bloom and damaged new
growth.''
   The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year
at 24.1 million hundredweight, up 25 percent from last year's
drought-reduced harvest but still 7 percent short of 1987
production. Acreage for harvest was up 24 percent from last year
kand the average yield, at 1,436 pounds per acre, was up 1 percent.
   Burley tobacco production was estimated at 543 million pounds,
up 14 percent from 1988 but fractionally below the November
forecast. The area for harvest is up 13 percent from last year and
the average yield is up 18 pounds per acre.
   No new estimates were issued for the major field crops such as
corn, wheat and soybeans.
   In a related report, the department's world outlook board said
prospective levels of cotton production and use in 1989 remain at
near the levels indicated last month, although production prospects
are up on a few foreign countries.
   ``This likely will mean reduced needs for U.S. cotton in world
markets and lower U.S. export prospects,'' the report said.
   The global outlook for wheat is ``largely unchanged'' the
November forecast, the report said. For corn, sorghum, oats and
other so-called coarse grains, 1989-90 production and inventories a
year from now are expected to be down marginally from last month's
outlook.
   ``Larger output is forecast for Canada, Eastern Europe and
Australia,'' the report said. ``However, these gains are more than
offset by smaller crops in the Sudan, Argentina, Mexico and several
other countries.''

<HEAD>Energy Futures Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices finished mixed Tuesday
with wholesale home heating oil rising as crude oil and gasoline
declined.
   Energy market analysts said a late round of selling defused a
rally that had carried the January crude oil contract near its
highs.
   The contract for January delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 5 cents to $20.65 per
barrel, erasing a portion of Monday's 22-cent increase. The
February through April contracts posted larger declines.
   The January contract for No.2 heating oil rose 0.35 cent to
67.30 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, adding to
Monday's gain of 0.58 cent. But contracts for delivery during
February through April fell by amounts ranging from 0.27 cent to
0.68 cent.
   The nearby heating oil contract gained support from cold weather
in the United States and abroad. Oil demand in Europe has been
bolstered by low water levels on the Rhine River, which has reduced
output of hydroelectric power.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which sank 0.25
cent on Monday, dropped another 0.37 cent to 52.03 cents a gallon.
Other contracts also closed lower.
   Demand for gasoline usually slows in late autumn and winter so
prices typically ease.
   Energy broker Eugene Croutier, of E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said once January crude oil rose past $20.80 late in
the session, sellers started unloading the contract. They were
acting on the assumption that the contract would open lower on
Wednesday, as it had reached the price objective that traders were
expecting.

<HEAD>Seeks Permission to Sell Computers to Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. is seeking U.S.
government approval to sell the Soviet Union six mainframe
computers that would be used to improve the safety of civilian
nuclear power plants, company officials said.
   One of the computers would be installed at the site of the 1986
nuclear accident in Chernobyl, the company said Monday. The Cyber
962 computers would be sold under a $32 million, 1-year contract.
   The rule banning high-tech exports to the Soviet Union recently
was lifted. Computer sales to the Soviets has been a touchy issue
because of concerns by U.S. officials that high-powered computers
could be used for such military purposes as designing weapons.
   The Cyber 962 computer is about three years old and does not
represent the latest technology, said James Ousley, president of
Control Data's computer products group. It falls well below the
performance level of supercomputers, used by the United States to
design nuclear weapons.
   Control Data long has had business ties with the Soviet Union,
but it has not sold a machine there since 1978. It applied for an
export license for the $32 million deal last month.
   Representatives of the Commerce, Energy and Defense departments
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are expected to rule on the
request this spring.
   ``The environment is much better for a sale of this type,'' said
Ousley. He said he expected Commerce and Energy department
officials to be enthusiastic about the sale but said defense
officials may express reservations.
   Control Data would have to supply on-site inspection and build
in safeguards to ensure that the mainframes would be used for the
stated purpose, Ousley said.

   Bell Canada claims to be reaching goals for its
ALEX videotex system here months ahead of schedule and is expanding
to small business customers as well as preparing for a debut next
year in Toronto.
   The two-year pilot project offering interactive services in
words and graphics through household terminals started a year ago
with the target of 20,000 customers in the Montreal area.
   ``It's very easy to use,'' Sylvie Bastien, a Bell Canada
spokeswoman, said in offering a demonstration. ``You don't need to
be a computer expert.''
   Bell Canada had been issuing regular progress reports on the
number of subscribers to ALEX that showed a slow start but steady
rise in the project's early months. The first weeks last December
were plagued by distribution difficulties.
   Mrs. Bastien said the goal of 20,000 residential customers was
reached in June but the company will no longer release updates on
the number of subscribers because it is valuable information for
competitors.
   Bell Canada operates primarily in Quebec and Ontario, Canada's
two most populous provinces.
   Although videotex systems have had some spectacular failures in
the United States, they have been popular in other countries such
as France where the Minitel system is used extensively.
   ALEX takes its name from Alexander Graham Bell, who emigrated to
Canada from Scotland before inventing the telephone while teaching
at a school for the deaf in Boston.
   The number of services available through ALEX does not approach
the more than 10,000 offered in France, but Mrs. Bastien said Bell
Canada has been pleased with its progress in a new field.
   From about 100 services available at the outset, the number has
risen steadily to 480. Among the services offered in French and
English are real estate listings, market reports, traffic
information, horoscopes, home shopping and bill paying, and news
and weather.
   ``You see how fast it goes,'' Mrs. Bastien said. ``We're very
happy because we didn't even think we would reach 300 services in
seven months.''
   About 60 percent of ALEX's customers rent the special terminal,
about the size of a small television set, from Bell Canada for a
monthly fee of $6.75. The others obtain the ALEX software to use
the system through their personal computers.
   The system plugs into any phone line.
   The average monthly bill is about $34, Mrs. Bastien said, but a
few customers have become addicted and run up higher bills than
their budgets could sustain.
   A clock runs on the screen showing how many minutes have been
used up on any connection. Some services are free, others run from
5 cents to 38 cents per minute.
   Bell Canada only rents the equipment. The services are provided
by other companies, and the most popular are electronic mailboxes
that Mrs. Bastien described as ``pale pink _ it's nothing obscene.''
   Mrs. Bastien said ALEX was envisioned as being for residential
customers but enough requests have come in from small businesses to
prompt the expansion. Final rate approval from government
regulators was pending on the plan.
   Bell Canada has applied to expand to Toronto, Canada's largest
city and its financial center, in April. It also is seeking
regulatory approval to change the formal status of ALEX from a
two-year trial to a continuing commercial service.
   The Canadian government was involved in developing the Telidon
videotex system that is the basis for ALEX. It was turned over to
private companies for further development.

   The stock market closed higher Tuesday after a
late-afternoon rally led by the energy sector.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 23.89 to close at
2,752.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
889 up, 639 down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board was 176.82 million shares,
up from 147.13 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 213.88 million shares.
   Analysts said large share-block purchases of oil and gas stocks
were triggered by expectations of further gains following the rally
of recent weeks. The broader market traded in narrow ranges until
stock-index arbitrage program trading sent prices higher in the
late afternoon, they said.
   ``It looks like a pretty big rush to the plate with oils,'' said
Eugene Peroni of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``I
think there's a perception that oil prices are going to be moving
higher next year.''
   Oil companies accounted for seven of the 13 most actively traded
issues on the Big Board.
   Phillips Petroleum and Exxon traded the most heavily, with
Phillips up 1] to 25~ and Exxon up 1{ to 51\. Phillips' rise was
attributed to a $250 million stock buyback announcement Monday and
a higher earnings estimate for 1990.
   Among other oil issues, Pennzoil gained 1] to 87|, Royal Dutch
Petroleum shot up 3\ to 76}, Mobil increased 1| to 63, Texaco
gained 1{ to 57[, Chevron rose 1\ to 68[ and Unocal was 1{ higher
to 30|.
   ``The market was fairly firm all day long,'' said David Bennett,
a market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It was
trending higher all day.''
   Contributing to the Dow industrials rise, Procter &amp; Gamble
surged 3 to 68\ as the firm estimated that net income for the
fourth quarter would rise 27 percent from a year ago, and UAL
gained 2} to 176}.
   Otherwise, traders said the market generally was biding time
until the release on Friday of reports on the producer price index
for November and the October trade deficit. Friday also brings
expiration of stock-index futures and options.
   Technology issues mostly declined. In the national
over-the-counter market, Apple Computer fell 3 to 36\ in heavy
trading after projecting an earnings decline and slowing sales
growth for the first quarter of fiscal 1990.
   Intel was down ] to 32, Compaq fell \ to 81] after a weak
earnings forecast, International Business Machines added ~ to 97,
Hewlett-Packard lost [ to 45| and Digital Equipment up ] to 84].
   Land's End slipped 2~ to 20~ a day after reporting it expects
fiscal year earnings to be 13 percent lower than a year earlier.
The mail-order retailer tumbled 4| Monday after the announcement.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $22.50 billion, or 0.66
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.61 to 194.44.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 3.80 to 402.71, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 3.17 to 351.73.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.99 to 452.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 377.41, up 2.37.

<HEAD>IBM-Sears Computer Service Seems to Be Catching On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are better ways to get publicity, but a
fight between homosexuals and Christian fundamentalists
nevertheless has called attention to the rapid growth of a home
computer service owned by IBM and Sears.
   The Prodigy service has expanded to a quarter-million
subscribers in 160,000 homes from 30,000 homes a year ago. It
serves 21 of the nation's largest markets, up from six a year ago.
   Prodigy is a risky venture that still is losing money and might
not catch on. But analysts say it seems to stand a good chance
because its formula appeals to the do-it-yourself, do-it-now spirit
in its target market of affluent American families.
   If Prodigy does succeed, its backers will be sitting pretty _
numerous previous failures show the videotex market is costly and
difficult to penetrate. As it is, Prodigy's expansion is taking a
heavy investment by the nation's biggest computer company and its
biggest retailer.
   ``I think Prodigy has learned a lot from the people who have
gone before. They're losing a ton of money. That's in their
business plan. But it's also in their business plan for this to
catch on in a big, big way,'' said Efrem Sigel, president of
Communications Trends Inc. in Larchmont, N.Y.
   Prodigy allows people to bank, shop, trade stocks, read news,
play games, chat or teach themselves, via their home computer. It
costs a flat $10 a month.
   Other home computer services such as CompuServe, Genie, Bix and
Delphi charge by the hour and are more geared to true computer
enthusiasts.
   CompuServe, the nation's biggest service with about 600,000
subscribers, is trying to appeal to a broader audience by making
its screens more uniform and its commands simpler to understand.
CompuServe, which is owned by the H.&amp;R. Block Inc. tax service,
already is profitable.
   Prodigy's adverse publicity came in the past week after it
canceled a chat service named Health Spa, an electronic ``bulletin
board'' that allowed subscribers to post notices or communicate on
health-related issues.
   Prodigy said Health Spa was canceled because of low usage, but
some subscribers said it was because one section of Health Spa had
turned into a forum for a heated debate on homosexuality between
gays and fundamentalist Christians.
   Dozens of subscribers have been demanding the return of Health
Spa _ an unintentional testament to the popularity of Prodigy's
services.
   Chatting on ``bulletin boards'' such as Health Spa is more
popular than anyone at Prodigy had predicted, but it is a small
part of the service in comparison to services such as banking and
shopping.
   More Americans became do-it-yourselfers in the 1980s, with the
proliferation of automated teller machines, mail-order catalogs and
self-service gasoline stations.
   Prodigy is aimed at upper-income people with home computers who
want to do things themselves for reasons of convenience, variety
and control.
   One such person is Jonathan Beacher, a traveling consultant to
television stations. Beacher, who lives in the Atlanta area, says
he saved $2,500 on airline fares in the first three or four months
by booking flights himself. He also pays bills through the bank by
computer, while his wife orders groceries and his children chat
with friends, play video games and use the encyclopedia.
   To Beacher, Prodigy is a little like a microwave oven _ it's
hard to imagine life without it.
   ``Before we had a microwave oven here, we thought, `Oh my gosh,
the food will taste terrible.' But you end up doing whole new kinds
of cooking.''
   Complaints about Prodigy range from its relative slowness _ the
fancy, user-friendly graphics are a drag on the computer _ to
questions about its usefulness.
   Many people still would rather get news from newspapers, weather
from television and groceries from a trip to the supermarket.
Computer phobia is prevalent and even people who use computers at
work may not be enthusiastic about using them at home.
   Aware of the difficulties, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
seems to be steering clear of videotex even though it was freed to
enter the arena by a federal judge's order in July.
   ``Videotex is sort of the most glamorous but also the most
expensive way to get into electronic publishing,'' said AT&amp;T
spokesman Michael Keady, noting that many companies have failed in
it. Spokesman Jim Byrnes called it ``a technology in search of a
market,'' indicating AT&amp;T might be more likely to get into
audiotex, which involves voice messages.
   Ray LaMadeleine, a commercial real estate agent in Glendale,
Calif., said Prodigy is establishing a position for itself that
will be hard to dislodge if videotex does catch on _ as
International Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. are
betting it will.
   ``Others who try to climb in and start from scratch, they better
be prepared to sped the same kind of bucks, because I don't think
there's any cheaper way to do it,'' LaMadeleine said.
   Prodigy will not comment on how much it has spent or when it
hopes to turn a profit.
   ``Suffice it to say that it is a long-term business
proposition,'' said Prodigy spokesman Brian Ek.

<HEAD>No New Subcompacts From Chrysler Until Mid 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday it will not build any
subcompact cars until the mid-1990s after it stops production of
its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon.
   Chrysler marketing vice president John Damoose said the company
will offer a stripped-down version of its compact Dodge Shadow and
Plymouth Sundance until a replacement subcompact is in production.
   But he said the new subcompact probably will not go into
production until after cars derived from the LH and LX platforms
are introduced, scheduled for the fall of 1992.
   Chrysler is to halt production of the Omni and Horizon in early
February when it shuts down its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in
Detroit. The company has said slow sales spurred the shutdown, but
the United Auto Workers union contends Chrysler wants to cut costs.
   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry
newsletter, subcompact cars made up 13.1 percent of the total U.S.
car market. The Omni and Horizon, the only subcompacts built by
Chrysler, comprised 8 percent of the automaker's car sales of about
959,128 through Nov. 30.
   Damoose outlined for reporters Chrysler's plans for the North
American International Auto Show in Detroit next month, where it
will feature its new Dodge Stealth sports car, the new Dodge Monaco
being built in Canada a LeBaron sedan and a new Jeep.
   Damoose said Chrysler planned to build 25,000 to 30,000 Stealth
cars to compete in the same market as the Mazda RX-7 and the Nissan
300ZX. No price has been set forthe car, which goes on sale in
October.
   He also said Chrysler production planners forecast the company
will hold its 13.8 percent share of the U.S. car and light truck
market in 1990 as sales for the entire industry tumble to about
14.2 million vehicles.
   Chrysler's 1990 sales estimate is the lowest of the Big Three.
General Motors Corp. officials estimate that about 15 million
vehicles will be sold next year and Ford Motor Co. executives put
the volume at about 14.7 million, slightly below 1989 sales.

<HEAD>May Co. Buying Four Miller &amp; Rhoads Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE GEARAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of ailing Miller &amp; Rhoads Inc.'s
stores will be sold to St. Louis-based retail giant May Department
Stores Co. for about $22.7 million, Miller &amp; Rhoads president John
E. Stokely said Tuesday.
   The four stores, two in Richmond and two in Hampton Roads, will
be added to the May-owned Hecht Co. chain next month, Stokely said.
The purchase price does not include the four stores' merchandise,
which May has agreed to buy, he said.
   The sale is effective Jan. 15, contingent on approval from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Douglas O. Tice Jr. who is overseeing Miller &amp;
Rhoads' liquidation, May President Thomas A. Hays told a
Washington, D.C., news conference.
   Arlington-based Hecht's has 22 stores in northern Virginia,
Washington and Maryland. The chain is expected to make job offers
to ``a significant number'' of Miller &amp; Rhoads workers at the four
stores, Stokely said.
   ``As the largest retailer in Washington-Baltimore, we have been
serving customers for almost 130 years and we are very pleased to
be able to extend our service to the Richmond and Tidewater
areas,'' Hecht's President Irwin Zazulia told reporters.
   Hecht's plans to invest $8 million in fixtures, displays and
other upgrades at the four stores, Zazulia said. Long-range plans
include the possibility of adding a store in suburban Richmond and
another in the Tidewater area, Zazulia said.
   Hecht's also plans to open new stores in Waldorf, Md. in 1990
and Woodbridge, Va. in 1992, Zazulia said.
   An earlier news conference called by May for Nov. 28 was
postponed because May and Miller &amp; Rhoads executives needed more
time to hammer out the deal, May officials said.
   Stokely said the company continues to seek buyers for the 10
other stores in the chain, including Richmond's flagship downtown
store.
   Miller &amp; Rhoads, a major Richmond retailer for more than a
century, sought for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws in July.
   The sale of the four stores is part of a liquidation plan the
company filed Nov. 28 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   May, which had sales of about $11.5 billion last year, has
embarked on an aggressive expansion plan and allocated $3.7 billion
for expansion this year.
   May owns 14 department store chains, one discount chain and a
nationwide self-service shoe chain, Payless ShoeSource.
   Hecht's is third among May's department store chains in sales,
with $759 million last year.

   Gold futures prices inched nearer to new highs for the year
Tuesday on New York's Commodity Exchange after taking a quick
breather from their energetic advance of the previous five sessions.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures slipped; oil futures
were mostly lower; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled 80 cents to $1.10 higher with the contract
for delivery in December up $1.10 at $417.90 a troy ounce, just
$1.80 shy of the 1989 high of $419.70 set Nov. 24.
   Silver futures finished 2 cents to 2.2 cents lower with December
at $5.672 a troy ounce.
   Gold has rallied from $401 an ounce in the past six sessions.
But the bulls appeared to be weakening early in Tuesday's
back-and-forth trading, which saw the December contract dip as low
as $415.30 before recovering late in the session.
   Analysts said investors were drawn from the gold market by
strong advances in the stock market and in the British pound and
West German mark.
   Nevertheless, they said, uneasiness about the shifting political
climate of Eastern Europe should continue to stir investment demand
for gold and support the market.
   ``At this point, the market is catching its breath and getting
ready for the next phase, the upside phase,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, a metals analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Heating oil for January delivery rose for the 10th straight
session on the New York Mercantile Exchange as bitterly cold
weather seized the Northeast. But all other energy futures prices
fell ahead of late Tuesday's weekly inventory report from the
American Petroleum Institute.
   The API said U.S. stocks of crude oil fell by 8.2 million
barrels last week. The number was far above market expectations and
is likely to prompt buying of crude futures on Wednesday.
   The API reported a reduction of nearly 3 million barrels in U.S.
stocks of petroleum distillates, which include heating oil. The
number was near the high end of market expectations.
   Gasoline stocks rose by about 500,000 barrels, as expected.
   West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled 5 cents to 42
cents lower with the contract for delivery in January at $20.65 a
barrel; heating oil was .53 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
January at 67.30 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to
.50 cent lower with January at 52.03 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in quiet
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as players awaited news of
new export sales.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of
about 104,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
   The USDA also announced that talks on a new long-term grain
agreement between the superpowers would probably begin in February.
The location for the talks has not been set.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $4.13{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to } cent
higher with December at $2.33 a bushel; oats were } cent lower to \
cent higher with December at $1.44{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents
lower to 1} cents higher with January at $5.77 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were supported by strong spot markets; pork
futures were pressured by lower wholesale pork-belly prices and
signs of continuing slack demand for bacon.
   Live cattle finished .40 cent lower to .23 cent higher with
December at 76.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.25 cent higher with January at 83.37 cents a pound; live hogs were
.23 cent lower to .25 cent higher with December at 50.92 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies 2 cents lower to .80 cent higher with
February at 50.37 cents a pound.

<HEAD>IBM Upgrades Service Offerings for Mainframes, PCs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the prowl for new sources of revenue,
International Business Machines Corp. on Tuesday announced upgraded
service offerings for customers who buy its mainframe computers and
personal computers.
   The announcement comes as IBM struggles with a price war that
has slashed profits across all segments of its product line. The
company last week announced plans to cut another 10,000 jobs next
year.
   IBM's upgraded its service offerings in response to requests
from customers, said Pat Kearney, vice president for software
services for IBM's National Service Division in Franklin Lakes, N.J.
   ``For some time our customers have been asking us to provide
these services. For some time we have been saying `no' to them, if
I may be so blunt,'' Ms. Kearney said. Now, she said, IBM is saying
yes.
   IBM should be able to recruit customers easily because ``if you
don't like what you're getting you'll just stop,'' said Sam Albert,
a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.
   For personal computers, IBM has established a center in Tampa,
Fla., that will take calls around the clock, seven days a week,
from customers having problems with any brand of personal computer,
software or peripheral equipment such as printers.
   The service is intended for big accounts with hundreds of PCs.
IBM says it has hired or trained people who are knowledgeable about
non-IBM equipment, including machines such as Macintoshes from
Apple Computer Inc.
   For mainframes, IBM is letting customers have direct access to
an internal IBM data bank that contains typical problems with
mainframes and recommended solutions. For an extra charge,
customers can get other levels of service in which IBM would become
intimately involved in running the company's central computer
system.
   Digital Equipment Corp., IBM's closest rival, said it also has
service offerings that include maintenance of equipment from other
suppliers.

<HEAD>Banks Reopen; Immediate Gap Between Official, Free Market Austral</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES throughout with gap between official and free market
rates widening by day's end; ADDS new information on rise in bus, plane
fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks reopened Tuesday after a
24-hour holiday ordered by the government when it devalued the
austral by 34.5 percent.
   But the devaluation intended to narrow the gap between
Argentina's official and free market currency rates had little
immediate success, as the gap widened 23 percent by day's end.
   Meanwhile, the government disclosed the last part of its
economic adjustment plan would include hikes in state-controlled
prices of public services.
   When financial institutions opened, the austral sold for about
1,000 for every U.S. dollar, the official rate set Sunday night,
when the government hiked gasoline prices by about 60 percent.
   When markets closed, foreign exchange houses offered dollars for
1,230 australs apiece.
   The gap between the official and free market rates led to the
devaluation, the second in five months.
   Businessmen in general favored the changes, which they said were
necessary for economic stability. Nevertheless, some insisted the
government of President Carlos Menem make deeper cuts in state
spending, and speed up the program of privatizations and
deregulation.
   Groups representing the important agricultural industry, which
has withheld from the central bank the dollars earned from overseas
sales of beef and grain, criticized the government for increasing
export taxes at the same time it devalued the austral.
   Farmers stood to reap windfall gains from the devaluation, which
would have put more australs in their pockets from every dollar
they turned in. Export taxes _ a major source of government revenue
_ were increased by about 11 percent.
   Starting Wednesday, the cheapest bus ticket will rise 86 percent
to 130 australs, while domestic plane fares will cost 62 percent
more.
   President Menem defended the measures, saying the goal ``is to
achieve the stability of the economy.''
   ``Of course there may be protests, but it is the only way out
for Argentina which is emerging little by little from a sad
situation of inflation and hyperinflation,'' Menem told reporters.
   Thus far, the changes had not prompted any protests by
Argentines, officials said.

<HEAD>Giant Laser-maker Spectra-Physics Up For Sale Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy Ltd., says it
wants to sell Spectra-Physics Corp., the world's largest maker of
lasers and a company Ciba-Geigy won just two years ago in a
takeover fight.
   Spectra-Physics, a leading manufacturer of the scanners that
read bar codes in groceries and retail stores, is likely to benefit
from new ownership willing to invest more in the company, a
spokesman for Ciba-Geigy and analysts said Tuesday.
   But the announcement was met by stinging criticism from San
Jose-based Spectra-Physics' founder and former president, Herbert
M. Dwight Jr., who left last year to head Superconductor
Technologies Inc. of Santa Barbara.
   ``It's just a tragedy that Spectra-Physics could fall prey to a
hostile takeover from a company that doesn't have the stomach to
make the investments'' needed to expand, Dwight said.
   Ciba-Geigy, a $12 billion-a-year company, plans to focus on its
core businesses in drugs, agriculture and chemicals and reduce its
involvement in electronics, chairman Alex Krauer said.
   But Sam Isaly, a pharmaceutical industry analyst with the firm
Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, speculated the real reason for the
reversal was is a combination of several developments.
   ``There was a change in top management at Ciba since the
interest in Spectra-Physics was first taken,'' he said. ``The new
fellows completed the purchase (for $227 million) but that was
pretty much put in place by their predecessors.
   ``The new management has a somewhat different vision of the
company,'' Isaly said.
   The old management wanted to diversify, Isaly said, partly
because the outlook for their core businesses was ``tenuous''
earlier in the 1980s, with few new products. Now those businesses
are picking up and the outlook for new products is good.
   ``So the improving outlook for core businesses plus the change
in management led them to reconsider staying in the kind of
businesses Spectra-Physics is in,'' he said.
   In addition to divesting Spectra-Physics by mid-1990, Ciba-Geigy
plans to sell Swiss-based Gretag, an electronics and photofinishing
equipment maker, and a 37 percent stake in 3-D Systems, a maker of
stereo-lithography technology.
   Ciba-Geigy plans to retain its Mettler-Toledo unit, a $625
million-a-year maker of electronic weighing equipment, because that
company can sustain itself without further investments, a spokesman
said.
   No price tag has been set on the companies for sale, but Isaly
said Spectra-Physics might be worth about $300 million.
   Ciba, with $900 million in profits last year, had plenty of
money to invest but apparently didn't want to commit large sums to
Spectra-Physics' research and product development, Isaly said.
   Along with bar code scanners, Spectra-Physics makes medical
instruments, graphics equipment and measuring devices, including a
fingerprint detector so sensitive it can ``see'' prints inside of
gloves.
   ``Spectra-Physics is a very fast-growing business that requires
substantial investments to sustain the continued growth,'' said
Ciba spokesman Tom Chizmadia. ``It wasn't a matter of not being
able to meet that; it was just more of a strategic shift.''
   The sale has nothing to do with Spectra-Physics' profitability,
Chizmadia said. Since 1987, sales have grown about 16 percent a
year to $296 million in 1988 and an expected $327 million this
year, and the company has been profitable every quarter.
   Ciba-Geigy took over Spectra-Physics in 1987 after a six-month
battle with Reliance Financial Services Corp., which is controlled
by takeover specialist Saul Steinberg.
   Krauer said one of Ciba-Geigy's ``primary objectives is to find
the right home for Spectra-Physics.''
   ``Because we intend to sell Spectra-Physics in its entirety to a
company with a long-term strategic commitment to the electronics
industry, the sale should have no adverse impact on Spectra-Physics
employees,'' he said. ``In fact, the sale should create new growth
opportunities for employees.''
   The company has 3,100 employees worldwide.

<HEAD>Combined Quarterly Losses Total $106.8 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. department store divisions of heavily
indebted Campeau Corp. on Tuesday reported combined quarterly
losses totaling $106.8 million.
   Federated Department Stores Inc., operator of Bloomingdale's,
Burdines, Lazarus and other chains, lost $70.6 million in the three
months ended Oct. 28. Allied Stores Corp., which runs Jordan Marsh,
Stern's and others, lost $36.2 million during that quarter.
   Both department store groups reported sales and losses on a
comparable division basis, restating 1988 results to exclude
holdings that have been sold.
   Federated's third quarter loss came on sales of $1.23 billion,
compared with losses of $43.4 million on sales of $1.11 billion in
the comparable quarter a year earlier.
   Allied reported third-quarter sales of $654.8 million, compared
with sales of $611.4 million a year earlier when the company had a
loss of $19.4 million.
   Commenting on their losses, the two divisions each said that
``such a negative income position would be expected for its
operations in these periods because more than half of the annual
retail profits traditionally are produced in the fourth quarter,
while interest expenses on debt remains constant throughout the
year.''
   Allied and Federated are based in Cincinnati while the parent
company has its headquarters in Toronto.
   Campeau's quarterly report, released separately in Toronto, said
the company had a net loss of $105 million from continuing
operations during the quarter, compared with a net loss of $78
million during the same quarter of 1988.
   Federated noted that on Oct. 28, it operated 131 department
stores in 19 states. Its five retained divisions include Abraham &amp;
Strauss, Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Lazarus and Rich's.
   The 17-store Bloomingdale's chain has been put up for sale as
part of a plan to help Campeau cope with a cash crunch. Campeau has
said that several parties have expressed interest in buying the
chain.
   Allied operated 127 department stores in 16 states among its
retained divisions, which are Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Maas@Jordan
Marsh Florida, and The Bon Marche.
   Federated reported a nine-month, pre-tax loss of $277.3 million
on sales of $3.28 billion, compared with a loss of $211.9 million
on sales of $3.01 billion in the corresponding period of last year.
   Allied's nine-month loss was $135.8 million on sales of $1.81
billion, compared with $158.1 million on sales of $1.7 billion last
year.
   Campeau said it lost $296 million through three quarters of this
year significantly wider than last year's nine-month loss of $14
million.

<HEAD>Emerson Buys Two Companies For $595 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerson Electric Co., a major producer of
electric motors, on Tuesday purchased Leroy-Somer SA, Europe's top
maker of electric motors, for $460 million.
   Industry analysts said the acquisition could make Emerson the
world's leading manufacturer of electric motors.
   ``My guess is this puts Emerson over the top, probably by a
decent margin,'' said Kent Newcomb, an industry analyst for A.G.
Edwards in St. Louis. ``Relative to what the company was making,
the price looks pretty high, but it's a strategic acquisition. And
it's probably cheaper than putting up the brick and mortars from
scratch.''
   In addition to acquiring Leroy-Somer of France, the St.
Louis-based company also announced the $135 million purchase of
McGill Manufacturing Co., a Valparaiso, Ind., company that makes
bearings and electrical products.
   Aside from prepared statements announcing the acquisitions,
company officials were unavailable for comment.
   Emerson, which is also a leading producer of industrial
monitoring equipment, tools and components for appliances, had
annual sales of $7.1 billion in 1989. The company had operations in
15 countries in 1988.
   Craig Krapf, an analyst for Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. in St. Louis,
said the acquisition of Leroy-Sommer is in line with Emerson's
growth strategy in the last six years.
   ``Emerson has done a fantastic job of improving profitability at
smaller firms,'' Krapf said. ``They've got a knack for that.''
   The Leroy-Somer acquisition, which is subject to U.S. and French
regulatory approval, gives Emerson a chance to increase its
presence in the European Economic Community before 1992, when the
12-nation bloc becomes a single unified market.
   In addition to its U.S. divisions, Emerson has some electric
motor divisions in Japan, Canada and Mexico.
   Leroy-Somer is a manufacturer of integral and fractional
horsepower electric motors and drives for industrial markets, with
manufacturing facilities primarily in France.
   Emerson said when the deal is completed, it will sell
Leroy-Somer's King Bearing unit, which is based in the United
States.
   McGill, the largest employer in Valparaiso, makes bearings and
electrical products primarily for industrial uses.
   ``The acquisition adds a premier brand name to Emerson's power
transmission business, and McGill's electrical products are a nice
complement to the products of our other divisions,'' said Jim Orso,
a spokesman for Emerson's public relations firm, Fleishman-Hillard.

   JMB Realty Corp. reportedly is bidding for
Bloomingdale's department stores and Hilton Hotels Corp., and an
industry analyst said Tuesday both properties would mesh with the
international firm's expansion strategy.
   JMB, a real estate investment, management and development firm,
is one of at least six bidders for all or part of Hilton, which
went on the market in May, the Wall Street Journal reported in
Tuesday's editions.
   The Chicago Tribune reported that JMB _ which owns a glitzy
downtown mall anchored by Bloomingdale's Chicago store _ is among
several bidders for the 17-store chain.
   Burton Glazov, JMB's executive director, declined to comment on
the reports.
   Neither potential acquisition would be a first for JMB, which
owns the Liberty House retail chain in Hawaii and several hotels,
including the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons in Chicago, and the
Century Plaza in Los Angeles, Glazov said.
   A spokeswoman for Toronto-based Campeau Corp., Bloomingdale's
parent, declined comment Tuesday on the reports.
   Hilton does not expect any deal to close before the end of this
year, said William Lebo Jr., general counsel for the Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based company. He declined to comment on the bidding or the
Journal story.
   In a statement issued Friday, the deadline for Bloomingdale's
bids, Campeau said it had ``received a number of expressions of
interest from parties seeking to acquire the 17-store chain.'' The
statement said details are confidential and that Campeau would not
further discuss the ``first stage'' of the sale.
   Campeau has said it expects to pare the list of prospective
buyers ``to no more than five or six finalists'' who will receive
more detailed information in preparation for the sale, expected to
be completed by February.
   The sale price has been estimated at between $1 billion and $1.3
billion.
   JMB is a privately held corporation with holdings in Chicago and
other major U.S. and Canadian cities are worth more than $21
billion, said spokesman Dennis Waite.
   ``A connection has existed for a while between JMB and
Bloomingdale's in that ... there was a joint venture with Federated
Department stores ... in developing shopping centers and
Bloomingdale's was anchor in some of those malls,'' Waite said by
telephone Tuesday.
   Bloomingdale's is part of the Federated chain acquired by
Campeau in 1988. JMB acquired Federated's shopping
center-development arm in 1984.
   Waite also declined to comment on the reported bids.
   Louis Masotti, a professor of management and urban development
at Northwestern University, said he had not heard about JMB's
reported interest in the two high-profile properties, but added,
``I wouldn't be surprised'' if they're true.
   ``There isn't anything for sale that they don't try to buy,''
Masotti said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   ``They seem to be targeting the name brands that don't require a
great deal of advertising to put them in contention for national
markets but do require a certain amount of capital and management
skills, both of which JMB seems to have in abundance,'' he said.
   The Journal reported Monday that besides JMB, other bidders for
Bloomingdale's are: Bahrain-based investment bank Investcorp
International, Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub and Ann Taylor
Inc. Chairman Joseph Brooks.
   Other possible bidders include such established retail companies
as Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. and May Co. of St. Louis,
which have declined comment on their possible interest in the
chain, the Tribune said.

<HEAD>Bear Stearns To Resume Computerized Trading Strategy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. said Tuesday it was resuming
limited computerized program trading, but it promised to follow
several standards aimed at reducing market volatility.
   The company is the first among the major Wall Street firms to
resume index arbitrage trades for its own account. Several
brokerages abandoned such activity last month amid criticism it was
dangerously distorting the stock market and scaring away small
investors.
   The move prompted criticism in Washington, where legislation
that would allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to restrict
program trading was introduced before Congress.
   ``Bear Stearns' statement today shows why voluntary measures
restraining program trading don't work,'' said Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., chairman of a House committee that investigated the
effects of program trading this past fall.
   ``It's like making red lights optional. It's too much to ask
traders to refrain on a voluntary basis from making money. I
believe their actions make the perfect case for the passage of
legislation which grants the SEC the authority to prohibit or
constrain manipulative or abusive trading practices which led to
artificial volatility,'' he added.
   Bear, Stearns said it would abandon all index arbitrage if the
Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 50 points. It also promised to
adhere to industry guidelines in observance of all trading halts,
or circuit breakers, during wild price swings in the market.
   In addition, Bear, Stearns said it would follow the so-called
uptick rule which was enacted to control excesses in short selling
of individual stocks. Short sellers borrow shares, then immediately
sell them for cash because they expect the price of a stock to
plummet. The short seller makes a profit by buying the replacement
shares at the lower price.
   Index arbitrage involves stock-index futures, or contracts to
buy and sell baskets of stocks based on particular indexes like the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. These contracts have come to represent
a bigger market than that of common stocks, albeit with higher
stakes.
   Using computer programs, traders seek to capitalize on brief and
minute differences in prices of stocks and stock-index futures by
buying or selling stocks with opposite trades in the futures.

<HEAD>Pratt &amp; Whitney to Warn of Engine Idling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney of Canada Ltd. has agreed in
a $6 million court settlement to warn aircraft owners that one of
its engines could suddenly idle, causing the plane to crash, if the
engine is not equipped with a special filter, an aviation attorney
announced Tuesday.
   The agreement was reached Friday in U.S. District Court, a day
after a jury awarded compensatory damages to the family of a man
who died in a 1985 New Jersey air crash, attorney Arthur Alan Wolk
said.
   Wolk said the settlement came while the jury deliberated whether
to award punitive damages.
   The jury found Pratt &amp; Whitney liable for the death of Matthew
Macario, 29, of Coatesville, Pa., who died Feb. 1, 1985, when the
Beechcraft King Air he was piloting crashed on approach to the
Millville, N.J., airport. Co-pilot Donald Burns, 58, of Yardley,
Pa., also died.
   The settlement requires the small-engine manufacturer to issue
an ``Urgent Service Bulletin'' advising aircraft owners that Pratt
&amp; Whitney PT-6 engines without a special filter could suddenly roll
the engine back to idle, and contribute to or cause a crash, Wolk
said.
   The bulletin will advise owners of the availability of P3 line
filters that can reduce the possibility of fuel control unit
contamination, which causes the rollbacks, he said.
   A spokeswoman for Pratt &amp; Whitney, Louise Boutin, said the
company had no immediate comment on the settlement. She said the
company has made the engine since 1963, but she had no estimate on
the number produced.
   The attorney for Pratt &amp; Whitney, Grant McCabe, was ill Tuesday
and could not be reached for comment. His assistant in the case,
Lawrence Wright, refused to comment.
   ``If this service bulletin saves just one life, the time, effort
and cost of the trial will be worth it,'' said Wolk.
   Wolk claimed that Pratt &amp; Whitney knew about the potential
problems in its engines without filters since 1973. He said some
Beechcraft aircraft, but not all, have the filter installed in
their engines.

<HEAD>Pitney Bowes Announces Workforce Cuts in Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pitney Bowes Inc. said Tuesday it will
cut its workforce by 1,500 in the next three years as part of a
major restructuring.
   Pitney Bowes also said it plans to cut the number of
distribution centers, eliminate some of its field operations and
begin a major training program, as part of an initiative to make
the company more competitive and efficient in the 1990s.
   The changes will result in a one-time, $120 million charge
against fourth-quarter earnings, to be offset by a change in income
tax accounting procedures, the company said.
   Pitney Bowes said it expected no immediate layoffs and hoped to
cut the workforce mainly through attrition and early retirement.
The cuts are mainly in manufacturing and will affect 700 in
Connecticut.
   Spokesman Terrence Marable said he expected some workers would
be retrained. He said the last reduction, in 1987, eliminated 225
jobs, mostly through a redeployment of workers.
   Pitney Bowes, which employs 30,000 worldwide, sells and services
office copiers and facsimile machines. It makes equipment for voice
dictation, price identification and mailing and shipping, such as
the technology that places bar codes on bills sent through the mail.
   ``Within the last five years the nature of Pitney Bowes'
products has been evolving,'' Marable said. ``We've moved from
mechanical and electromechanical products to products that are
highly electronic and incorporate the latest computer and software
technology.''
   George B. Harvey, chairman and president, said the changes will
require fewer jobs in manufacturing, as well as different skills in
those who make, sell and service the company's products.
   The company said it would undertake major programs to train
employees in new design, manufacturing and product service
techniques.
   Harvey said the initiatives, including a new division to sell,
market and service dedicated copiers in the U.S., would ``bring us
even closer to our customers, assuring us a significant competitive
advantage and excellent return for our stockholders.''
   Pitney Bowes had $2.6 billion in revenues last year. It had $2.1
billion in revenues from the first three quarters this year, an 11
percent increase from the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Largest Company Deal Ever in Sweden Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swedish government and Volvo
automotive company announced a $3.7 billion agreement Tuesday
giving Volvo a 40 percent stake in the government-controlled
holding group Procordia, in the largest deal of its kind the
country has seen.
   In return, Procordia acquired AB Volvo's food division,
Provendor, and the auto giant's share in Pharmacia AB, a
pharmaceutical company.
   Procordia's takeover of the two Volvo subsidiaries creates a new
group which will have 48,000 employees and a yearly turnover of
about 35 billion kronor, or about $5.4 billion.
   Trading in the shares of the three companies was halted Tuesday
morning on the Stockholm bourse. The details were announced at an
evening news conference by Industry Minister Ivar Nordberg and
Volvo's managing director Pehr Gyllenhammar.
   The scale of the 24 billion-kronor deal is unprecedented, and
compares with the entire Swedish defense budget of 30 billion
kronor.
   Analysts said the deal will probably have a positive effect on
Swedish industry and will lead to structural changes with more
competitive companies.
   Gyllenhammar will be chairman of Procordia, while its present
chief executive officer Soeren Gyll will be proposed as CEO of the
new group.
   The purchase will turn Procordia into one of Europe's 20 largest
pharmaceutical companies.
   Procordia already controlled a pharmaceutical company, Kabi,
which together with Pharmacia expects a turnover of nearly $2
billion next year.
   Procordia will also become market leader in several food areas
within Scandinavia.
   Its food sector, which includes Pripps Brewery, had a turnover
of 5 billion kronor last year, while Provendor registered a 10
billion-krona turnover.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's Social Democratic government
approved the deal late Tuesday, but it also needs approval by
parliament.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a group of personal computer users in
London warned computer users Tuesday night to steer clear of a
mailed disk purporting to give information on AIDS because it could
be part of a sabotage plot.
   Dr. Alan Solomon, who also heads a British company called S and
S specializing in the examination of computer viruses, said several
thousand of the disks had been mailed to legitimate computer users.
   Users' addresses had apparently been taken from computer
magazines, said Solomon, chairman of the IBM Personal Computer
Users Group.
   He said the AIDS Information Introductory Diskette, as the
computer disk is called, was so far not thought to contain an
actual computer virus, which attacks individual systems.
   But he said it had been identified as a potential preparatory
sabotage device known to computer experts as a ``Trojan,'' the full
effects of which are not yet known.
   Solomon said he received one of the disks in the mail on Monday
bearing a Panama postal box address. He said he feared more could
arrive in the mail this week.
   ``There is no urgent panic in the short term but if it has
already been installed I would advise them (computer users) to seek
urgent help because it is a nasty thing,'' he said.
   A letter accompanying the disk asks for payment of $189 for one
type of license and $378 for another, he said.
   Solomon said few experienced computer users would risk
installing an unsolicited disk without first checking it but that
some less experienced users might.

<TEXT>
   Maybelline, one of the top sellers of
cosmetics in the United States, has been put up for sale, parent
company Schering-Plough Corp. said Tuesday.
   The company said Maybelline was put on the block as part of a
strategy to concentrate on prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals, and personal care and vision care products.
   Maybelline, established in 1915 and named after the sister of
founder T.L. Williams, was obtained by Plough in 1967 before Plough
merged with Schering, said company spokesman Linn A. Weiss.
   ``The business is strong, it's viable, it's growing,'' Weiss
said. ``The decision results from an orderly review of our
strategies and long-term objectives.''
   Maybelline recorded 1988 sales of about $280 million, up 10
percent from the previous year.
   It is second behind Cover Girl in individual units of cosmetics
sold.
   Schering-Plough sold its two European cosmetics companies,
Rimmel International Ltd. and Chicogo GmbH, in July to Unilever, a
European manufacturer of consumer products and package goods.
   Weiss declined to comment on whether Maybelline had any
prospective buyers.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is assisting in the sale.

   Warmed by the thaw in East-West
relations, the City Council on Tuesday unanimously voted to repeal
a local ban on Russian vodka imposed in 1983 after a Korean
passenger jet was shot down by the Soviets.
   Mayor Paul Ackland said the city would write a letter to the
Soviet Embassy to inform them of the action.
   ``We want them to know that we as a community support the
changes being made,'' Ackland said, ``and hope our relationship
will continue to improve.''
   He said the city would send a gift of goods made in Hutchinson
as a token of friendship.
   Michael Carls, the council member who introduced the ban six
years ago, said it was also his idea to lift it.
   ``It's not a stunt. We take it seriously,'' said Carls, who
teaches American government to high school students in the town of
10,000 about 45 miles west of Minneapolis.
   ``It was first outrage over their denial of life to those
passengers on the jet and today it's a feeling of pleasure over the
extent of democratization over there,'' he said.
   Carls said other U.S. cities with municipal control over liquor
sales banned Soviet vodka from store shelves after Korean Air Lines
Flight 007 was shot down off Sakhalin Island in September 1983. All
269 people, including 61 Americans, were killed.
   The jet was shot down on a flight from Anchorage to Seoul after
it strayed into Soviet airspace.
   Jeannette Matheny, a clerk at Hutchinson Municipal Liquor Store,
said the ban created some discussion in 1983. But since then, she
said, it's been forgotten.
   ``I don't even think most of the public was aware of the ban,''
Matheny said. ``I understand that we will restock the vodka, but it
won't be an extensive line. One or two brands at the most.''
   Carls said there were no plans for a ceremonial sip of the
libation at the city council meeting.
   ``It will be adopted without opposition and without much
discussion,'' he said. ``We just don't want the events in eastern
Europe to go by without expressing our pleasure at what's going
on.''

   A Canadian employee of NCR Corp. was held
without bail Tuesday after he was charged with attempting to sell
proprietary information about NCR products to Unisys Corp.
   Anthony S. Latchoo, 28, of Rexdale, Ontario, was arrested Monday
by FBI agents after a two-month investigation as he left Unisys
headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., FBI special agent Wayne R. Gilbert
said in a statement.
   Latchoo, a product manager for NCR's Waterloo, Ontario,
engineering and manufacturing division, allegedly approached a
Unisys employee in October and offered to sell him information
about NCR document imaging technology and marketing strategies,
Gilbert said.
   Imaging technology allows businesses to store, process, display
and retrieve electronic information on a computer. Gilbert said the
information, if stolen, could have cost NCR more than $100 million.
   Latchoo had allegedly sought ``substantial monetary
compensation,'' Gilbert said.
   The Unisys employee contacted by Latchoo informed superiors, who
in turn reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Philadelphia, according to Unisys spokeswoman Charlotte LeGates.
   She said she could not comment further on the arrest because
company officials did not want to hamper the FBI investigation.
   Latchoo met with the Unisys employee Monday and was arrested at
the end of the meeting, FBI spokesman John Kundts said.
   NCR spokesman Robert Farkas said the Canadian facility produces
document-processing equipment.
   Kundts said both Unisys and NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio,
cooperated in the investigation.
   Farkas said NCR learned of the attempted espionage from the FBI
on Dec. 7. A preliminary assessment indicated just one person was
involved and no information actually changed hands, he said.
   Latchoo has been charged with interstate transportation of
stolen property. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison
and a $10,000 fine.
   Latchoo has been suspended by NCR pending a review of the
charges, according to Farkas.

   Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., has recalled
batches of its estrogen therapy tablets after tests showed
variances in their uniformity.
   The drug company said the differences in the 10 batches of
tablets wouldn't alter the therapeutic value of the drug, sold as
Conjugated Estrogens.
   Estrogen is sold as a synthetic form of the female hormone and
often is prescribed for women who have undergone hysterectomies or
who have entered menopause.
   The batches being recalled were produced in 1988, the company
told The Cincinnati Enquirer in a report published Tuesday. It was
unlikely many tablets remained because the product has a two-year
shelf life, the company said.
   Telephone messages left at company headquarters in Cincinnati
were not returned Tuesday.
   In a statement, Duramed said it could not assess the financial
impact of the uniformity issue and the product recall, but said
they were ``likely to have a material adverse effect.''
   ``Nevertheless, the company is confident that it has adequate
resources to continue its business plan to develop and introduce
new products,'' the statement said.
   Duramed manufactures and sells generic drug products of various
dosages of prescription drugs.
   An analysis is under way to determine if production should be
halted, the company said. Until it is completed, more recalls are
possible and, under certain circumstances, the company may suspend
production of the current formulation of the product, Duramed said.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a decision that could fatten state
coffers by millions of dollars, the state Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday that Connecticut companies should not have written off
commissions they paid to their international sales subsidiaries.
   In the unanimous decision, the high court said the state tax
code did not allow manufacturing companies to deduct the
commissions they paid to their ``domestic international sales
corporations'' or DISCs from state corporation income taxes from
1981 to 1984.
   Richard D. Nicholson, legal director of the Department of
Revenue Services, said the ruling is worth at least $3 million to
the state. He said the state knows of about $1.5 million in taxes
deducted as commissions. Another $1.5 million collected by the
state was, in effect, frozen in state accounts until the high court
made its decision, he said.
   Nicholson said using DISCs, which allowed federal tax
write-offs, was a common business practice between 1972 and 1984.
Several Connecticut companies believed they were eligible for
similar state write-offs in 1981 when the state's tax code changed,
he said.
   Nicholson said the ruling could affect numerous Connecticut
companies who may find themselves owing the state money.
   He also said the Connecticut Supreme Court ruling could prove
precedent-setting elswhere, although he did not know how many other
states face similar cases.
   The Connecticut decision knocked down a challenge raised by Bolt
Technology Corp, a Norwalk-based maker of seismic sound source
systems; Olin Corporation Inc., a Stamford-based chemical company,
and Perkin-Elmer Corp., a Norwalk-based optical instrument and lens
maker.
   Olin and Perkin-Elmer owe about $1.2 million in taxes because of
the high court's ruling, Nicholson said. Bolt Technology had paid
$115,000 in taxes on the commission, but that payment had been put
on hold pending the outcome of the court case, he said.
   There were about 15 other pending cases on the matter, said
Phyllis Tarizek, spokewoman for the state Department of Revenue
Services.
   ``Not only will we have the millions of dollars that were put on
hold, we are not going to lose a lot of money we brought in. That
was a big concern. We're happy,'' Tarizek said.
   Timothy F. Bannon, Commissioner of Revenue Services, said ``I'm
delighted, but not surprised, to be vindicated by the state Supreme
Court.''
   The federal tax code, from 1972 through 1984, allowed companies
to create DISCs as a way to encourage foreign sales, Nicholson
said. The companies set up the subsidiaries to lease or sell goods
in another country. In turn, the companies with DISCs were eligible
for federal tax breaks.
   Under the state tax code revised in 1981, Connecticut allowed
companies to write off dividends from their state corporation
income taxes. But the state said companies had to pay taxes on
expenses related to their dividends.
   The high court agreed with the state claim that the DISCs were
expenses related to dividends, and therefore subject to state
taxes, Nicholson said.
   ``Of course, I'm disappointed that the court took the contrary
opinion,'' said George G. Vest, the Stamford-based attorney for
Olin and Perkin-Elmer corporations.

   The administration may lift bans on ``normal
commercial exports'' to China, including satellites that nation
would launch, after reviewing sanctions imposed after the violent
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the White House said
Tuesday.
   ``No decision has been made ... but it is possible,''
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   The administration is specifically looking at three Hughes
Aircraft communication satellites, one due for launch by China in
April and the others in 1991 and 1992, that were held up by Bush's
ban on export of weapons and satellites to China last June.
   Two of the satellites are being built for Australia, and an
Australian official said Tuesday ``we basically get a positive
sense'' from talks with the State Department on the possibility of
quick approval.
   Roger Uren, political counselor at the Australian Embassy, said,
``We've made it clear this is important to us. We have a sense the
Americans understand.''
   The administration ``suspended the export of all items on our
munitions list, which includes satellites and other items that are
not weapons,'' Fitzwater said, after the Chinese killing of
hundreds of demonstrators last spring.
   ``We recognize that some items captured in the suspension here
have civilian applications and fall under the category of normal
commercial exports,'' he said.
   He said the administration ``is reviewing these exports but has
not reached any decision on granting waivers so that they may
proceed.''
   Bush has encountered stiff criticism for opening the door for
renewed relations with China in the face of that nation's continued
actions against political dissent and in light of its record on
human rights.
   Meanwhile, a Bush administration official disclosed to The
Associated Press that a third administration official, White House
personnel director Chase Untermeyer, had gone to Beijing on the
administration's mission to China last weekend.
   The official did not say why Untermeyer went. The Washington
Post said in Wednesday editions he visited two Chinese friends of
Bush, a former ambassador to China, for their assessments of the
situation there.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of House Foreign Policy
subcommittee on international economic policy and trade, said
Tuesday after Fitzwater's comments, ``I suppose it shouldn't
surprise me, after watching the administration fly to China without
any change.''
   ``In China, where the government has only tightened the screws,
the Bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to
try to do to help the Chinese government,'' Gejdenson said. ``It
makes no sense whatsoever.''
   In addition, House Democrats announced plans for a quick vote to
try to override President Bush's veto of a bill aiding Chinese
students in this country.
   The vetoed bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California,
would permit Chinese students to remain in the Unite States
indefinitely if they fear retaliation at home. Bush says he is
accomplishing the same thing by executive order.
   The administration already has allowed progress on some
U.S.-China commerce since imposing the sactions that not only
covered military items but nuclear supplies and any loans to China
from the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank.
   Bush said Monday that the sanctions remain in place, even though
he sent two emissaries _ National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger _ to China over
the weekend and thus put an end to the suspension of high-level
contacts between the two nations.
   Fitzwater reiterated Tuesday the president's sentiment that
``China needs to take certain actions to indicate a change in its
repressive policies,'' before relations can be normalized.
   Since the sanctions were imposed, the U.S. government has
allowed export of four Boeing jetliners, worth $650 million, with
guidance systems that were on the U.S. munitions control list of
sensitive technology.
   In addition, Chinese engineers have been allowed to return to
work in the United States on a $500 million program to upgrade
Chinese F-8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronics
equipment. The White House said no planes were to be delivered, in
keeping with the export ban.
   There has been no change in the deferral of $957 million in
World Bank loans and $336 million in Asian development Bank loans,
said Fitzwater.
   Two of the satellites in question are being built by Hughes
under a $300 million contract with Australia which is using a
Chinese launch vehicle, and are due for launch in 1991 and 1992,
said Hughes spokesman Don O'Neal in a telephone interview from Los
Angeles. The third is a six-year-old Westar satellite being
refurbished by Hughes for AsiaSat, a British-Chinese consortium
also using a Chinese launch vehicle to put the satellite in orbit
next April.
   Fitzwater said Hughes has told the administration it needs a
decision ``relatively soon in order to meet the manufacturing and
delivery timetables and allow the launches to proceed on schedule.''
   The Boeing planes, among 11 aircraft the contractor had on order
to Chinese commercial airlines, were to be delivered in June, said
Boeing spokesman Randy Harrison.
   Bush's sanctions were to suspend their delivery unless and until
the State Department and Commerce Department agreed with Boeing's
appeal that the navigation device in question was for civilian
application and could not be removed for military use without being
obvious, Harrison said.
   The government arms sales that have been suspended by the
sanctions include a largely completed large-caliber artillery
manufacturing modernization program worth $28 million; $62 million
worth of artillery-locating radar, and $10 million worth of
surface-launched antisubmarine torpedoes.
   The administration is permitting subsidies for grain sales to
China, announcing on Dec. 5 that China was eligible to buy an
additional one million metric tons of wheat using Export
Enhancement Program subsidies.
   The Chinese had used up almost all of their previous EEP
allocation, a two-million-ton promise made when Bush visited China
last February. Nearly half the sales under that allocation have
been made since the Tiananmen Square massacre.
