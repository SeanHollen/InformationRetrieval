   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said
Thursday he was unable to set up conciliation talks between
Nicaragua and the United States, as requested by President Daniel
Ortega.
   Also Thursday, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto accused the U.S.
government of spreading ``systematic lies'' to discredit Nicaragua
and its preparations for free elections in 1990.
   Ortega publicly asked Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Managua, on Monday to act as a go-between in setting
up the talks with the Bush administration resolve its differences
with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista regime.
   The cardinal said he would think about it, but State Department
spokesman Rudi Boone on Tuesday rejected the offer. He said an
improvement in relations would depend on a number of factors,
including ``an end to Nicaraguan support'' for leftist guerrillas in
El Salvador.
   Boone, in Washington, also said Nicaragua should hold free and
fair elections under international supervision and enter into of a
genuine dialogue with opposition groups before the U.S. agrees to
sit down and talk.
   Referring to Boone's statement, Obando y Bravo wrote Ortega
saying that ``for the time being it is not possible to enter into a
process of mediation ... because one of the parties has officially
set conditions for the dialogue.''
   Ortega read the Obando y Bravo's letter at a news conference,
expressed thanks to the cardinal, and said he will ``insist through
other venues with the U.S. government and President Bush to accept a
dialogue with Nicaragua.''
   The United States cut off all aid to Nicaragua in 1980, started
supporting Contra rebels the next year and slapped an economic
embargo on this nation in 1985 to pressure the Sandinistas to hold
free and fair elections and sever military ties with Soviet bloc
nations.
   U.S. administrations have argued that Soviet and Cuban military
aid to the Sandinistas and Nicaragua's help to the Salvadoran
guerrillas is threatening security in Central America. The
Sandinistas claim they have been providing only moral support to the
Salvadoran rebels.
   An attempt by the United States and Nicaragua to hold talks in
Mexico in 1984 ended in deadlock, with the Reagan administration
accusing the Sandinistas of failing to negotiate in good faith.
   The 14-party National Opposition Union on Thursday asked Obando y
Bravo to try and set up talks with the Sandinista government to try
and resolve these differences. But the cardinal, himself a sharp
critic of the Sandinistas, did not respond immediately.
   Earlier Thursday, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto accused the
Bush administration of spreading ``systematic lies'' to discredit
Nicaragua and denied allegations by Vice President Dan Quayle that
Nicaragua is allying itself with Cuba and Panama to form a three way
anti-U.S. alliance.
   Speaking in Caracas, Venezuela, where he was attending a Third
World meeting, D'Escoto said: ``I would take anything a U.S.
government official says with a ton of salt. Systematic lying is an
instrument of their foreign policy. The only thing he (Quayle) needs
for his opinions is his mouth.''
   D'Escoto also denied recent allegations by Bush about Nicaragua's
election procedures and said the Sandinistas were ``strictly
complying with the agenda for the elections in February 1990.''
   Critics have said the government stacked a national election
board, which will supervise the balloting process, in favor of the
Sandinistas. Also, as of June 1 U.S. citizens were required for the
first time to get visas to enter Nicaragua, making it difficult for
American observers to be there.

<HEAD>Indian Authorities Interrogating U.S., German Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities are interrogating two U.S.
and two West German pilots after Indian air force fighters forced
down their small planes near the Pakistani border, the Defense
Ministry said Thursday.
   In Washington, the State Department identified the Americans as
Frank Haile Jr., 57, of Dallas, and Carson Gilmore of Rocksprings,
Texas.
   The two, making an around-the-world trip in a Beechcraft Bonanza,
were intercepted by the Indian jets on June 16 and forced to land at
Bhuj airfield in western Gujarat state, a Defense Ministry spokesman
said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the two men were traveling with two West Germans, whose
Beechcraft also was ordered to land at Bhuj, about 500 miles
southwest of New Delhi.
   A West German Embassy official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the Germans pilots with only their last names
as Kuhlmann and Kuffner.
   The Defense Ministry spokesman said the planes had strayed about
310 miles off the assigned course and intruded into restricted
airspace over Bhuj, a marshy wasteland near the border with Pakistan.
   Civil aviation authorities cleared the planes to fly from New
Delhi to Bahrain via Bombay, he said.
   The pilots were first questioned by air force officers and later
handed over to federal intelligence officers, he said.
   A U.S. Embassy offical said a consular officer attended the
interrogation. The U.S. Privacy Act prevented disclosing more
information about the pilots, said the official who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   Haile and Gilmore departed from the suburban Addison airport in
Dallas three weeks ago.
   Haile, the owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering
firm, has flown around the world twice and is an experienced
long-distance pilot, according to his wife, Joan.

<HEAD>HUD Looking Into Apparent Diversions in Austin Project</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 5 grafs after 6th graf, `Lee refused...,' to UPDATE
with developments in Indianapolis. Picks up 7th graf, `Last week...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into the
apparent diversion of up to $90,000 in housing funds intended for
poor families living in federally subsidized apartments here, it was
reported Thursday.
   The money was supposed to cover rent and utility bills in 1986 to
early 1988 for five families who lived in the housing complexes
known as Interregional Apartments, the Austin American-Statesman
said.
   The 99 apartments were shut down by the city in September because
of building code violations.
   ``It may be a while before we can get to it, but it is scheduled
for investigation,'' said Johnny O. Lee, the Housing and Urban
Development regional inspector general in Fort Worth.
   ``Right now, it's waiting in line with a lot of other cases,''
Lee said. ``It's a question of time and manpower.''
   Lee refused to say who might have diverted the funds, saying it's
their policy not to comment on ongoing investigations.
   In another development, HUD officials in Indianapolis said
Thursday that almost a third of the $257,012 that federal auditors
said might be missing from the agency's office here has been found.
   Payments have been received or documentation found for $80,046.95
from the sale of five foreclosed homes during a 4{-year period, said
J. Nicholas Shelley, director of the Indianapolis HUD office.
   In a June 13 report, federal auditors identified 16 Indiana
transactions for which the agency hadn't received payment. Auditors
said the proceeds, plus $30,486 in damages, should be paid to the
government.
   Authorities and Indianapolis Realty, which handled closings on
the sales, are looking for documentation of the remaining 11
transactions, which brought $176,965.50, officials said.
   If the transfer of the money can't be documented, Shelley said,
the government stands to get its money either from Indianapolis
Realty or its bonding company.
   Last week, a private escrow agent from Maryland nicknamed ``Robin
HUD'' told Congress she diverted millions of dollars from government
housing programs.
   The agent, Marilyn Harrell, admitted to investigators that she
did not forward at least $5.5 million to the federal housing agency,
saying she donated much of the money to charitable projects to
provide housing for the poor.
   In Austin, the principal owner of the Interregional Apartments is
San Antonio investor Benard L. Lifshutz, who said he was aware that
some subsidies were taken but he was not involved.
   Another partner in the project, listed in city records as Chuck
McGinnis of Austin, could not be located, the newspaper said.
Lifshutz said he and McGinnis are no longer business partners and he
had not spoken to McGinnis in months.
   According to a letter from the city to the HUD inspector general,
the apparent diversion of federal utility subsidies took place
between August 1986 and February 1988.
   Former acting City Manager John Ware told City Council members in
a memo last year that the exact amount of money taken was hard to
determine because the owners' records for those years ``are
virtually non-existent.''
   City staff at the Department of Housing and Community Services,
which administers the federally subsidized housing program, said
they believe the amount was $80,000 to $90,000.
   The department staff first learned of the problem when
Interregional tenants complained that their electric, gas, and water
services were being disconnected.
   City records show that dozens of the apartments were overrun with
rats and cockroaches; contained exposed and damaged plumbing and
wiring; had holes in some of the floors and ceilings; and could not
meet minimal city building and safety codes.
   Police records also show that by 1986 the apartment complexes had
become a center of criminal activity, including prostitution and
drug dealing.
   At one point, police records show, one tenant at Interregional
offered ``drive-up curb service,'' making drug deals through an
apartment window.

   Military officials and former comrades of Col.
Gregory ``Pappy'' Boyington dedicated a life-size bust Thursday at
the Marine Corps Air Station here to honor the late World War II ace.
   Boyington's widow, Josephine, of Fresno, Calif., and son, Gregory
Jr., attended the ceremonies at the base, the home of VMA-214, the
Black Sheep Squadron. The nickname for the group originated around
the idea that members of the squadron, formed in the Solomon Islands
in 1942, were misfits.
   Boyington shot down 28 aircraft while fighting in the Pacific
Theater, and his squadron accounted for a total of 197 Japanese
planes.
   Shot down Jan. 3, 1944, over Tokyo, Boyington spent the rest of
the war in a prisoner-of-war camp in Omori, Japan. He was mistakenly
presumed dead during the war and awarded the Medal of Honor _ the
nation's highest decoration for military valor _ posthumously.
   Boyington died Jan. 11, 1988. The bust was the idea of his
longtime friend, Raymond ``Hap'' Halloran, who said attending
Boyington's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery gave him the
desire to do something special to commemorate his friend.
   Halloran, an Army Air Corps fighter pilot, was shot down over the
Pacific in January 1945 and met Boyington in a prisoner-of-war camp.
   ``To see him in real life was a comforting thing. I know probably
nothing would happen to us'' because Boyington was there, Halloran
said at the ceremonies.

   A single-engine plane that snagged a
wire above a 500,000-volt power line crashed Thursday afternoon,
killing three people and injuring a fourth.
   The pilot of the French-made TB-21 Trinidad reported engine
trouble shortly before the 2:13 p.m. crash near Placerita Canyon
about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, the Federal
Aviation Administration said.
   The survivor, a teen-age girl, was in critical condition at Henry
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, said hospital
spokeswoman Ann Ingram.
   The pilot and two other passengers were killed. None of the
victims' names was immediately released.
   The four-seat plane hit a static wire, which protects the power
line from lightning, said Ed Fraudenburg, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power.
   The plane missed the power line itself, which carries enough
electricity for the needs of 3 million people, Fraudenburg said.
   DWP crews were assessing the damage to determine if the cable
needs to be replaced, Fraudenburg said.

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted felon and four-time presidential
candidate Lyndon LaRouche announced plans Thursday to run for
Congress next year.
   LaRouche, 65, a Loudoun County resident, wants to represent
Virginia's 10th District, which includes Arlington, half of Fairfax
and Loudoun counties. After filing his intent to run for Congress
with the Federal Election Commission on June 8, LaRouche became the
first Democrat to announce plans to go after incumbent Republican
representative Frank Wolf's seat.
   LaRouche was convicted in January in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud
and conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. He was
sentenced to 15 years and is appealing the conviction.
   He ran for president as an independent in 1976 and as a Democrat
in 1980, 1984 and 1988.
   Asked whether he could serve his constituents well from jail,
LaRouche said ``I think this is a very turbulent period of history.
I could pop out of prison just as quick as I popped in.'' LaRouche
has maintained since his conviction that his trial was political.
   LaRouche and his associates were convicted for a scheme in which
they used a fundraising operation to solicit ``loans'' from people
that they didn't pay back. They failed to report the transactions to
the government.
   As a convicted felon LaRouche won't be eligible to vote for
himself, but he does meet constitutional requirements to run for the
House of Representatives, said Susan Fitz-Hugh, Virginia State Board
of Elections secretary.
   LaRouche is over 25, has been a United States citizen for more
than seven years and is an inhabitant of Virginia. He and five
associates are at the Alexandria jail awaiting assignments to
federal prisons.

<TEXT>
   The city has purchased the ground under
an adult book store and plans to evict the business when the lease
expires next month.
   The $257,400 purchase capped a drive by residents and other
business owners in the area to shut down Delray Book and Video,
which they complained sported racks of nudie magazines and sexually
oriented videos.
   The City Commission in this oceanside town midway between Fort
Lauderdale and West Palm Beach finally agreed to buy the property,
and City Attorney Herb Thiele announced completion of the sale
Tuesday.
   The store's lease expires at midnight July 31. Thiele said he
would not waste any time in shutting down the business.
   ``It is my intention to put chains and a padlock on the doors at
12:01 a.m. August first,'' Thiele said.
   The city plans to resell the property as soon as possible,
placing a deed restriction on it that would prevent another adult
entertainment establishment from moving there. Before the city sells
the property, however, officials want to annex the unincorporated
land into the city, Commissioner Mary McCarty said.
   Arnold Hecht, president of Manya Inc., which owns the bookstore,
said he did not want to talk about the city's plans or any legal
action the company might take.
   ``What's done is done,'' Hecht said. ``If the city wants to buy
(the property), that's their mistake.''

   A detective hopped on a surfboard to

police, authorities said.
   The man ran away after he was stopped for speeding Tuesday, said
Sgt. Dick Granger.
   He resurfaced and eluded police twice on foot before being

   After he ignored officers' orders to come ashore, plainclothes
detective Lt. Michael Muldoon borrowed a surfboard and went after
him.
   A 41-foot U.S. Coast Guard utility boat fished the two from the

   The man, who has refused to identify himself, has been charged
with resisting arrest and auto theft, authorities said.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the Rancho Seco nuclear power
plant has decided to accept bids for a private takeover of the
facility, despite a referendum that called for its shutdown.
   The 3-2 vote by directors of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District on Tuesday angered many of the activists who have fought
for years to shut down the plant, which has nearly a continuous
history of operating problems.
   On March 2, the directors had voted unanimously to abide by the
results of the June 6 referendum, in which voters turned down an
advisory measure endorsing the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District's plans to keep the plant running.
   The plant was taken off line June 7 and so far about 400 contract
workers have lost their jobs.
   Utility directors voting with the majority argued that voters
merely had forbidden SMUD from operating the plant.
   Divestiture of Rancho Seco ``remains a viable option ... that
could free this community from the staggering costs of
decommissioning,'' said Joseph Buonaiuto, president of the utility's
board of directors.
   The utility estimates it will cost about $200 million to close
the plant.
   Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said
it will sue to stop efforts to transfer Rancho Seco to private
businesses that might continue to operate it.
   ``We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period'' that
the utility set to accept bids, said Michael Remy, an environmental
attorney affiliated with the group. ``Our position still is that
enough is enough.''

<TEXT>
   Parasols have been placed over tropical orchids,
swamp crayfish have crawled out of a canal, and race goers have
collapsed with sunstroke at Royal Ascot.
   Britain is in the midst of a heat wave and Britons _ notorious
for never being accustomed to coping with an occasional hot summer
or cold winter _ are doing the best they can.
   The heat since mid-May has pushed up demand for water in many
areas by 50 percent. In parts of Wales and along the Welsh border in
England, many homes are without water main supplies.
   ``Even if this dry spell breaks, it is unlikely to help,'' said
spokesman Stuart Derwent of Southern Water.
   He said water reserves were at near-crisis levels before the heat
wave because of a mild winter and the longest spring in memory.
   As of today, people who use sprinklers or hoses to water their
gardens or wash their cars are threatened with a $620 fine by the
Lee Valley Water Co., which supplies parts of north London.
   Bans on such use were already in force in other parts of the
country.
   Lee Valley said Wednesday it was sending out patrols and hiring
extra staff to look for violators because demand by its customers
has risen from 60 million gallons a day to 85 million gallons.
   The tough measures followed weeks of television advertising by
the publicly run water boards seeking to attract potential investors
prior to privatization.
   Now that the heat's on, they are running out of water.
   One town actually ran out.
   Tankers had to deliver water to Nelson in Lancashire, where
officials blamed the drying-up mostly on avid gardeners leaving
hoses spouting all night.
   Quirks of the heat ranged from officers at London's Heathrow
Airport firing pistols to drive off flocks of swifts attracted by
swarms of insects, and trout dying at a fish farm in North Yorkshire
when their pond dried up.
   Human casualties resulted, too.
   Thirteen people drowned last weekend trying to cool off in lakes,
rivers, canals and pools.
   When the Royal Ascot race meeting opened Tuesday, ambulance
workers said they treated more than 50 people for mild sunstroke or
fainting, reviving them with orange juice and ice cubes.
   The weather was a degree or two cooler Wednesday after
temperatures in southern England hit 88 degrees on Tuesday, the
hottest June day in 13 years.
   It was already almost as hot in May, when orchids at the Chelsea
Flower Show were shielded with umbrellas so they wouldn't wilt.
   Hundreds of creatures hitherto unknown to Londoners crawled out
of the Grand Union Canal in the capital's Kensal Town district.
   They were identified as Central European swamp crayfish, seven
inches long, all waving legs, claws and whiskers.
   No one knew how the mud bugs got there, but London Zoo said they
must have bred in large numbers as a result of unusually high
temperatures.
   Borough authorities in London appealed to householders to take a
bucket of water a day to young trees in the streets facing ``water
starvation.''
   The trees were planted after a hurricane in 1987 felled an
estimated 15 million trees in southern England.
   London's Daily Telegraph said Tuesday that pests like aphids
threatened to reach ``epidemic levels'' in gardens and on farms.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day, Hungary's state-run
media carry a new report about privation in Romania or a purported
shooting on the heavily guarded border between the two countries.
   Hungary and Romania are allies in the Warsaw Pact military
alliance, but not even a summit of their Communist leaders last
August could ease the tensions between them.
   Their relations illustrate the depth of many historically rooted
quarrels now reappearing in the Soviet bloc that includes East
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.
   For centuries, Eastern Europe has been a volatile region of
shifting political allegiances and changing borders. A violent
history has made nationalism a powerful force and left many ethnic
groups in the area with a long list of grudges against neighbors.
   World War I broke up the once vast Austro-Hungarian Empire and
World War II left the Kremlin dominant in Eastern Europe.
Authoritarian Communist governments took power after the Red Army
swept in and ended Nazi Germany's reign.
   The Soviet Union, following the model laid down by Stalin, used
to exert pressure on East European Communist parties to maintain
outwardly friendly relations. With Mikhail S. Gorbachev as Kremlin
leader, those pressures eased.
   Until recently, traditional conflicts among ethnic groups with
different languages and cultures lay mostly dormant under slogans
trumpeting the international solidarity of socialism.
   Now, the Soviets are preoccupied with their own economic and
social woes, and the ethnic tensions are bubbling across the
borders. The East European allies, grappling with Kremlin-led calls
for democratic reforms, are reopening old wounds.
   Current quarrels vary from ideological differences over the pace
of governmental reforms in Poland and Hungary and other countries to
territorial disputes, minority rights and even cross-border
pollution.
   East Germany and Poland have argued over their common border and
fishing rights in the Baltic Sea; Romania has angered Bulgaria by
sending chemical waste wafting across the Danube; and customs wars
have flared in a region strapped for consumer goods.
   In November, Czechoslovakia annoyed the entire bloc by slapping
restrictions at 48 hours' notice on the export of just about every
consumer product Soviet bloc visitors might envy in Prague's
relatively well-stocked shops.
   Poles were especially outraged by measures that included
confiscation of purchases intended as Christmas gifts. Polish
travelers felt that the Czechs were deliberately reviving a
historical enmity between the two populations.
   The customs crackdown was designed to protect living standards
that have helped Prague's hard-line leaders keep outward peace with
a population disgruntled ever since the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
crushed Alexander Dubcek's reformist government.
   But the action immediately touched off retaliations throughout
the East bloc. Each country, including the Soviet Union, slapped
export bans on any consumer goods popular with tourists from
elsewhere in the region.
   That conflict has since died down.
   The most serious dispute involves Hungary and Romania. Simmering
throughout the 1970s, it broke into the open in late 1986 over the
seemingly innocuous issue of a Hungarian history book on
Transylvania, a mountainous region ruled by Hungary for centuries
but ceded to Romania after World War I.
   Under President Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania is trying to eradicate
the separate identity of ethnic minorities, and it immediately
accused Hungary of publishing the history with the aim of reviving
claims to Transylvania.
   At first, Hungary played calm on the diplomatic front, while
media and intellectuals whipped up emotions at home.
   Hungarians have given refuge to tens of thousands of Romanians
since January 1988, when Budapest broke a Hungarian-Romanian treaty
obliging it to send back defectors, some of whom braved border
gunfire to escape.
   Besides playing to proudly nationalist Hungarians, Budapest's
handling of the dispute served to underline Hungary's reformist
politics and to ally it with the West at international forums on
human and minority rights.
   Other East bloc neighbors have since begun to take more heed of
the sizeable Hungarian minorities left in their territories.
   The Soviet Union recently improved educational opportunities for
its small Hungarian minority and allowed more visits across the
common frontier.
   Czechoslovakia's 900,000 ethnic Hungarians have also received
better treatment. These improvements were overshadowed, however, by
Prague's quarrels with Budapest over a Hungarian television
interview with Dubcek and Budapest's suspension of work on a joint
dam and power project.
   Police crackdowns on anti-government protests in Prague in
January and the subsequent jailing of leading dissident author
Vaclav Havel drew public protests from intellectuals in Hungary, the
Soviet Union and Poland, where Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski
pointedly attended two Havel plays banned in Prague.
   A Hungarian TV interview with Dubcek, virtually a non-person in
Czechoslovakia since he was expelled from the Communist Party in
1970, further rankled Czechoslovakia's leaders. Budapest ignored
their protests and broadcast a second part of the interview anyway.
   Tension increased last month when Budapest called a two-month
halt to its work on a joint Danube dam project that has been a
subject of an environmental controversy since its inception in 1977.
   Czechoslovakia again strongly protested the move. This time,
however, it seemed as if an East bloc row might lead to domestic
protests.
   When prime ministers Miklos Nemeth of Hungary and Ladislav Adamec
of Czechoslovakia met to discuss the power project, Adamec took a
conciliatory tone in an effort to defuse tensions.

<HEAD>Massachusetts, Federal Officials Agree on Plan to Deport 1,000 Illegal
Aliens</HEAD>

   A policy reversal by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has
led state and federal officials to agree on a plan to deport about
1,000 illegal aliens held in Massachusetts prisons.
   In 1985, Dukakis issued an executive order forbidding state
investigators from working on deportation cases unless ordered to do
so by a court.
   That order was portrayed as gesture of good will toward illegals
at a time when the Reagan administration was cracking down.
   Under the new policy agreed to Tuesday, the state will work with
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to identify
and deport inmates of the crowded state and county prison system who
are in the United States illegally.
   When possible, the state will work ``aggressively to get these
people out on the next plane,'' said Human Services Secretary Philip
Johnston, who oversees Massachusetts' correction system.
   Regional INS director Charles Cobb, who met Tuesday with Johnston
to work out the plan's details and has criticized Dukakis' order,
called the agreement ``a step in the right direction.''
   About 1,300, or 10 percent, of the approximately 13,000 inmates
in state prisons are illegal aliens, according to Johnston. Of the
1,300, about 1,000 are eligible for immediate deportation.
   Most of the inmates involved have been involved in drug dealing,
and come from Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Colombia,
according to Johnston.
   Some convicted of particularly violent crimes, including four men
serving sentences for the rape at Big Dan's tavern in New Bedford in
1984, will remain in prison, Johnston said.

   ``Am I only fourteen? Am I really still a silly little

anyone of age has undergone.'' _ Anne Frank, April 28, 1944.

   Anne Frank turned 13 on June 12, 1942. She
received a blue blouse, roses, a bottle of slightly fermented grape
juice, a party game, a plant, a dish of sticky molasses, a bowl of
truffles and a homemade strawberry tart.
   She was also given a squarish book, commonly used to collect
autographs, with a red and white checked cover. Anne began keeping a
diary.
   What began as an adolescent's longing for self-knowledge evolved
into a lasting document about the destruction of human life, the
tragic loss of innocence and unfathomable hatred of the Holocaust.
   Forced into hiding by the Nazis, Anne chronicled her days with
uncommon humor, perceptiveness and faith in the goodness of people.
``The Diary of Anne Frank'' stands as a moving, tangible document,
and has sold millions of copies around the world.
   Anne died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, and
would have been 60 this year. A critical edition of her diary has
been released in the United States by Doubleday.
   A popular student at a Jewish school in Amsterdam, Anne Frank was
a pretty, dark-haired girl, outspoken in class and admired by many
boys. Yet the diary would prove to be her most cherished friend.

   ``I have darling parents and a sister (Margot) of 16. I know
about 30 people whom one might call friends _ I have strings of boy
friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing that,
peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, aunts ad
uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no _ I don't seem to lack
anything.
   ``But it's the same with all my friends, just fun and joking,
nothing more. ... We don't seem to be able to get any closer. .. .
Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a stubborn fact
and I don't seem to be able to do anything about it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   While hiding from the Nazis, Anne was transformed from a playful
girl of 13 to an insightful, compassionate, even spiritual
15-year-old. On Jan. 6, 1944, she recalled a dream about a boy from
school:
   ``I awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek
against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so
deep, that here he read how much I loved him and how much I still
love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad
that I had lost him again. ...''
   In another dream, she saw her late grandmother and a friend from
school.
   ``... Granny appeared as a guardian angel; then followed Hanneli,
who seems to be a symbol to me of all the sufferings of all my
girlfriends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews
and all those in need. ...''
   Prepared by the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation, the book includes essays on the Franks before and
after they went into hiding, the events surrounding their capture,
and how the diary reached publication.
   The new edition contains three versions of the diary: Anne's
first and second drafts, and the original published work, which
combines the two.
   But commemorating her birth was not the only reason for the
reissue. The book also offers a strong rebuttal to accusations made
over the years that the diary was fake, a shameless exploitation.
   In the late 1950s, right-wing newspapers in Austria and Norway
published attacks on the diary, insisting the ideas expressed were
far too sophisticated for a teen-age girl. In the mid-'70s, a German
publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that
Otto Frank, Anne's father, had written the diary with the help of a
New York playwright.
   Upon Frank's death in 1980, the original manuscripts were turned
over to the Netherlands war documentation institute; work on the
critical edition began the following year. One of the book's
editors, Gerrold van der Stroom, insisted in a recent interview that
the diary is indeed authentic.
   ``We asked the Dutch forensic laboratory of the Ministry of
Justice, which does the same work for police, to check the paper and
ink. They found that all the paper and all the ink, were very common
for the first half of the 1940s,'' he said.
   ``They also compared the letters before the war, postcards, etc.,
that she had written to her grandmother in Switzerland, with the
handwriting in the diaries. They found that the same person wrote
everything.''
   The Franks lived in Frankfurt, Germany, until 1933 when they
emigrated to Amsterdam after Hitler took power. The Nazis occupied
the Netherlands in 1940, and began imposing ever harsher anti-Jewish
laws, forcing Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed star.
   When the SS, the Nazi military police, issued a call-up notice to
Frank in July 1942, the family was forced into hiding. For more than
two years, the Franks and four others were holed up in a ``Secret
Annexe,'' located upstairs from Frank's warehouse in Amsterdam.
   They relied on friends, notably Miep and Jan Gies, to bring them
food and supplies, and prayed that the Allied troops would liberate
their country before the Nazis could find them.
   Police raided the annex on Aug. 4, 1944, and the prisoners were
sent off to Westerbork, a Jewish transit camp. Anne and her sister,
Margot, were later shipped to the notorious death camp, Auschwitz,
and eventually to Bergen-Belsen, where they contracted typhoid fever
and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945. Their
mother died at another camp.
   After the arrest, Miep Gies gathered up Anne's papers and kept
them under lock and key. When Frank returned to Amsterdam in June
1945, he headed straight for the Gies home and was presented with
his daughter's journals.

   ``I see the eight of us with our `Secret Annexe' as if we were a
little piece of blue heaven, surrounded by heavy black rain
clouds,'' Anne Frank wrote on Nov. 8, 1943.
   ``The round, clearly defined spot where we stand is safe, but the
clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates
us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly.''

   In 1947, a Dutch edition of the diary was published to
overwhelming acclaim. The book has since been printed in more than
30 countries, including West Germany, Finland, Spain, Argentina,
Iceland and Japan.

   When GIs came home after World War II,
the nation looked to the great forests of the Northwest for lumber
to build their houses.
   Oregon and Washington mills responded, and still supply more than
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the United States.
   ``There was always that one more shining hill covered with trees
to the west,'' said U.S. Forest Service budget officer Ron Johnson
in Portland. ``Now we find there's a Pacific Ocean and we fell into
it.''
   From the western slope of the Cascade Range to the shore of the
Pacific, this is the home of the Douglas fir, the towering king of
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber.
   It is also home to the Northern spotted owl, a 14-inch bird that
could face extinction because, with rare exceptions, it won't nest
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most
prized for timber.
   While logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl,
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are
being shipped for premium prices to Japan, China and Korea without
ever seeing the inside of an American mill.
   ``If a log is of export quality, and is available to be exported,
it will be exported,'' said Tom Mayr, owner of the Mayr Brothers
mill in Hoquiam, Wash. Mayr has been reduced to counting his supply
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being
loaded onto ships in Grays Harbor, Wash.
   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent
years the highest value has been offshore,'' said Jack Taylor,
operations manager for Weyerhaeuser in Coos Bay, where the region's
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce
metric-dimension lumber for the Japanese home-building market.
   Companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than
they can in the domestic market, said Forest Service economist Don
Flora in Seattle.
   Boom-and-bust cycles were known to the timber industry before the
spotted owl entered the spotlight, but for the first time the pinch
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and
dips in the housing market.
   Eighteen years ago, Brad Wentworth stopped off in the coastal
town of Gold Beach to see some friends on his way to college to
study forest management. Now he's 37, a husband and father, and one
of the 300 workers at Gold Beach Plywood who will be out of a job
this summer when the mill shuts down.
   ``I got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages,''
Wentworth said. ``I kick myself in the butt now.''
   Thirteen other wood products mills in Oregon and Washington have
closed this year, putting nearly 2,000 people out of work as the
industry enters a new era of high-priced timber in short supply. A
referendum Tuesday in Oregon calls for a ban on exporting
state-grown logs and asks Congress to make permanent an annually
renewed ban on exporting logs grown on federal land.
   ``The mill is old and inefficient,'' said Gold Beach mill manager
Eric Saunders. ``It would take about $3 million to bring it up. Why
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a
stable supply of timber?''
   The shortage of timber doesn't come as a surprise, but its
magnitude does.
   In 1976, Oregon State University forestry professor John Beuter
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that
the industry would have to depend on national forests, home to most
of the old-growth timber, to make it to the next century, when
second-growth trees planted before World War II would be ready for
harvest.
   Jerry Hamilton, director of resource services for Seattle's
Simpson Timber Co., had expected harvests in national forests to
decline about 20 percent in Oregon and Washington this year as the
Forest Service revised its long-range management plans. He now fears
it could drop 50 percent because old-growth forests have been ruled
off-limits because of the spotted owl.
   ``Historically, a lot of the impetus for the management of
federal lands in the West was to settle the West and develop it,''
said Beuter, now a consultant in Portland. ``We are sort of at the
end of that era now. We are at the point of recognizing that cutting
more timber isn't going to create new cities and new economic
opportunity in the West. In fact, we are coming around to where
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity.''
   Ed Whitelaw, a University of Oregon economics professor, has been
a leading proponent of the idea that the Northwest has more to gain
from preserving its blue skies, green forests and clear water than
from exploiting its resources.
   ``Most Oregonians receive two paychecks,'' he said. ``One is in
dollars. The other comes from the environment. By accounting for all
other amenities, I estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth
$1.3 billion. The paycheck from the timber industry is $1.5
billion.''
   In 1988, Oregon and Washington national forests supplied 5.4
billion board feet of timber, a third of the region's total harvest
from all lands. Where the Forest Service management plans used in
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 5.5 billion board feet, the
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 4.7 billion.
   Unlike owners of private forests, the Forest Service by law may
cut no more timber than it can grow back. It also has to provide for
the needs of fish, wildlife, campers, hikers and water quality.
   Where it once had to answer only to the timber industry, the
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder. The
governors of Washington and Oregon want to be sure there is enough
timber to sustain the rural economy. Environmental groups demand
preservation of old-growth forests. Academics have started offering
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature. And there
is new unrest inside the Forest Service.
   Jeff DeBonis, a Willamette National Forest timber sale planner,
has organized the Association of Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, with a mailing list of about 200. DeBonis
wrote in February to Forest Service chief Dale Robertson claiming
the agency is in bed with the industry.
   ``The question we need to ask concerned citizens is, `Why should
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut?''' he
said.
   Robertson's staff is preparing a detailed response to DeBonis'
letter, said spokeswoman Rose Narlock in Washington, D.C. ``Maybe we
need some of these things talked about. It was a gutsy move on his
part.''
   Robertson has acknowledged that the Forest Service has taken a
beating in the courts under the National Environmental Policy Act,
evidence DeBonis cites for his argument that too many trees are
being cut.
   While loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more
timber, the grim truth is jobs are disappearing, spotted owl or no
spotted owl.
   ``The biggest source of change in employment has been the
modernization and automation of the forest products industry,'' said
Wilderness Society economist Jeffrey T. Olson, who produced a study
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the Northwest has little to
do with cutting old growth in national forests.
   Flora, the Forest Service economist, said in the 1970s he figured
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber
jobs. That's now down to 1.5 jobs in the high-tech mills and four to
five jobs overall.
   Timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of
Portland and Seattle, but still vital in small cities and towns that
grew up with it.
   Oregon's 68,700 wood-products jobs _ almost all of them outside
the Portland area _ account for 5.2 percent of the state's
employment. Washington's 41,800 timber jobs account for 2.1 percent
of its employment. In 1986, the most recent figures available,
timber accounted for just 6 percent of Oregon's gross state product
at $2.5 billion and 2.2 percent of Washington's, at $1.6 billion.
   But Forest Service economist Con Schallau in Corvallis argues
timber has a greater impact than that, because it accounts for 38
percent of Oregon's basic economy _ bringing in outside dollars _
and 18 percent of Washington's.
   While economists may differ over timber's importance, they agree
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like Gold Beach,
population 1,500, with a payroll of $6 million from Gold Beach
Plywood.
   ``If you live in a big city you've got a lot of choices,''
Wentworth said, ``but if you live here you've got to work in the
brush or the mill.''

   One tip that Weyerhaeuser is taking bold
steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard.
   Weyerhaeuser, a leading exporter of logs to Japan, has gone a
step further to produce precision-sawn, metric-dimension lumber for
Japanese home builders, for whom the appearance of wood for
traditional post-and-beam construction counts more than the
structural strength valued in the American market.
   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent
years the highest value has been offshore,'' said operations manager
Jack Taylor.
   So the company scrapped an aging mill in North Bend on the
southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into ts mill of the
'90s, called CBX.
   ``We're pulling out all the stops,'' said superintendent Sam
Dickey as he showed off the paved log yard, laser-guided saws,
flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork. ``We're
spending $1 million on the upgrade.''
   But high-tech also means fewer jobs. When Weyerhaeuser announced
the CBX project in January, North Bend employed about 200 and
produced about 65 million board feet a year, about 3 jobs per
million board feet. The CBX crew of 69 can produce 45 million board
feet a year, or 1.5 jobs per million feet.
   The mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must
be extremely efficient, and Dickey expects his hand-picked crew to
lead the way. ``We're aiming to have this site be the model for the
industry.''
   To emphasize that point, Weyerhaeuser has installed catwalks for
visitors.
   ``All the major Japanese trading companies have been here once or
twice,'' said Dickey, who is learning Japanese.
   While Weyerhaeuser took the obvious steps of upgrading the
physical plant at CBX, it also is going where no sawmill has gone
before in its contract with the International Woodworkers of America.
   ``Basically, it lets people work as teams rather than in
individual job situations,'' said Milo Summerville, field
representative for IWA Local 3-261. ``Sometimes you have to give
something like this a trial period to see if it will work.''
   Lumber grader Al Esch is enthusiastic about being able to rotate
through three positions rather than sticking to one job. ``It's kind
of like being an immigrant in a new country,'' he said.
   Cheryl Howell, an 11-year veteran of the company, scored well on
a hand-eye coordination test, and was cross-trained to run
bark-stripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard. ``Before
it's done, I expect to know how to run everything in here,'' she
said.
   The first shift starts at 6:30 a.m., with workers and managers
joining in 10 minutes of exercises, followed by as much as 45
minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions. To
emphasize teamwork, Weyerhaeuser scrapped an old cleanup contract
and made everyone, including Dickey, responsible for keeping the
mill clean.
   Dickey is happy to get away from the old-style management
approach he calls ``big brain-little brain.''
   ``Generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are
starved for information,'' he said. ``We're giving them a big piece
of the operation.''

   In the rugged Illahe country where gold
miners still pan creeks running into the Rogue River, the Siskiyou
National Forest is trying techniques from a movement known as the
New Forestry.
   ``I see it as a major philosophical change rather than an
incremental change,'' said Forest Service scientist Jerry Franklin,
a leading spokesman for the movement. ``In terms of forestry
practice, it is revolutionary.''
   The New Forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate
over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old
growth ecosystem. Pressure to log these forests has increased as
private lands have been overcut.
   ``We need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving
the issue of how much old growth to leave, but perhaps more
important, how do we manage our commodity lands over the long
term,'' Franklin said.
   ``People are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide
jobs, yet keep values that are important to the public,'' said Gold
Beach District Ranger Kathy Johnson. ``The public is interested in
old-growth forest, interested in the species that inhabit the old
growth forest.
   ``We think there is an opportunity for these New Forestry
techniques to provide that middle ground.''
   While most national forests in Oregon and Washington still are
developing 10-year management plans, the Siskiyou National Forest
has fit the New Forestry into its plan with a goal of balancing
production against a healthy forest.
   The key to New Forestry is to save more of the forest's parts so
what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical
climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come
within the next 50 years.
   On the Siskiyou, the New Forestry is the basis for plans to start
logging in the next couple years the 7,100 acres known as the Illahe
Project, about 40 miles west of Grants Pass in southwestern Oregon.
   ``As we move out from that large block of old-growth forest into
areas previously harvested, we feather out the impacts,'' said
Johnson. ``We'll leave a certain amount of old-growth trees per
acre. That number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed
block of old growth forest.''
   That differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of
20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting
the impact.
   As scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest
interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the
ecosystem, breaking it into pieces too small to function. They also
have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of
forest.
   Instead of clearcutting, New Foresters will leave dead trees and
some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live.
Some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the
soil. Planners say the New Forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in
timber production over the 130-year harvest cycle.
   No decision has been made on how to approach slash burning, in
which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to
the soil, reduce fire danger, and make it easier to plant seedlings,
Johnson said.
   When it comes to replanting logged-over land, the New Forestry
suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut, to maintain a
diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change,
rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species
such as Douglas fir.
   Oregon State University forestry professor David Perry, also part
of the New Forestry movement, said, ``The point is that whatever you
do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the
adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope
with disurbance.''

   In small towns in Sicily, where just looking at a man
can get a woman labeled ``loose,'' Lara Cardella is being called all
kinds of names for telling how it is to grow up female and Sicilian.
   The 19-year-old native of Licata, Sicily _ population 45,000 _ is
also selling a lot of books.
   Her novel ``Volevo I Pantaloni'' _ ``I Wanted Pants'' _ has been
Italy's best-selling paperback since early spring. Cardella wrote it
at night, longhand in a notebook, in her parents' house, and
submitted it in an Italian contest for young, unpublished writers.
   She says she didn't expect to win, let alone get published. She
did both.
   Arnoldo Mondadori, the Italian publishing giant, has already sold
the film rights for the book, which at 121 large-type pages, is more
a novella than a novel.
   Cardella also didn't expect insulting telephone calls and
scornful looks from townspeople who felt ridiculed by the book.
   When she came out of her house one day with a French TV crew,
paramilitary police had to protect her from a crowd shouting curses,
she recalls.
   ``Some of my friends stayed by me. Some of them left me,'' she
said in a recent telephone interview from her home. ``My sister was
forced to change schools. Few of my parents' friends remain.''
   The small town in her scathing story could be Licata or hundreds
of other coastal towns or mountain villages in Sicily _ or, for that
matter, the rest of rural southern Italy.
   Telling the story is 16-year-old Annetta. She is not an
autobiographical character, Cardella says, but embraces the
experiences of many of her girlfriends whose modest attempts at
liberation _ like kissing a boy in public _ sometimes ended in
beatings or being kept at home under even tighter supervision.
   Annetta wants to wear pants like men. Or at least be able wear
her skirts short, like her friend Angelina who used to live in the
more liberal north.
   Annetta asks her mother how she can get pants.
   ``Her reply, innocent, revolutionized my adolescent life,''
Annetta says. ``She told me, `I pantaluna falli purtari e masculi e
buttani.''' The Sicilian dialect translates: Men and whores wear
pants.
   Annetta then sets out to learn how to put on lipstick, sway her
hips so boys will notice her and lie to her parents so they'll let
her go to an afternoon party _ at Angelina's house, naturally _
where there are more boys than girls and no parents.
   At the party she meets a boy named Nicola. The next day an uncle
sees Nicola kissing Annetta. She is beaten up by her father and
renounced by her mother, who's so busy weeping from shame she quits
cooking dinner.
   Wanting to eat again, her father arranges for Annetta to stay
with an uncle, even though her parents know the uncle sexually
molested her when she was 10 years old.
   ``Woman is wife, woman is mother, but she is not a person,''
Cardella writes.
   Most of Licata's residents who protested the book didn't read it,
she says. Cardella's detractors became even more enraged when she
went on a nationwide TV talk show and derided one of southern
Italy's most sacred rituals, the Sunday afternoon ``passeggiata,''
or stroll, taken after the day's big meal.
   Girls walk hand in hand, around and around the main square. Boys
cluster in groups and ogle the girls, who have mastered the art of
looking chaste and sexy at the same time. Older folks sit on the
sidelines to make sure all the boys and girls exchange are looks.
   After the television show, Cardella told another interviewer the
mayor met her on the street and said: ``You need to be straightened
out.''
   Cardella regrets blurting out on television that ``99 percent''
of Sicilians are backward.
   ``I love Sicily. It's so beautiful, it's stupendous. But the idea
that people won't denounce violence is wrong. ... Violence exists.
... I think it's wrong a woman can't go to a disco.''
   In general, she says, girls are more repressed in the poorer
towns and neighborhoods.
   Cardella says her parents were very strict with her, just ``like
the others.''
   ``But I tried to educate them, to make them see I wasn't doing
anything wrong,'' and now, she says, they support her in her battle
against repression.
   ``People say I'm impulsive. That I want to change things too
quickly. But I don't want to wait 100 years. I don't want to know my
daughter will have the same problems I did.''
   Enrolled in the literature department of the University of
Palermo, she studies at home and says when she marries her
boyfriend, she'll move to Gela, his town, 25 miles from Licata.

   Many of the leaders of China's now-quelled
demonstrations for political reform have fled their homes, changed
their names and appearance, and obtained false identification.
   Still the arrests mount, dramatizing how difficult it is to hide
from authority in this tightly controlled society despite China's
huge size and 1.2 billion population.
   Liu Gang, the sixth student on a wanted circular of 21 to be
arrested, fled to Hebei province just south of Beijing and
introduced himself as Zhang Shun, unemployed worker.
   But he was discovered by sharp-eyed civilians who thought his
skin was too white to be the worker he claimed to be.
   Even in ordinary times, a fugitive can be easy to spot. In small
villages, an outsider clearly stands out. In big cities,
neighborhood committees staffed by women with spare time keep a
close watch on comings and goings and make sure people register
overnight guests with the police.
   Housing is cramped and many people live in just one or two rooms
around a common courtyard, making it virtually impossible to hide a
fugitive.
   Official identification is always required to travel in China,
but controls have been sharply increased since the June 3-4 military
crackdown.
   Soldiers are checking identification and searching the bags of
travelers at the Beijing train station. At night, soldiers stop most
cars at major intersections, check the ID of drivers and sometimes
search the cars.
   Plainclothes police are out in strength, sometimes betraying
themselves by suspicious squawks from under their clothing or
too-careful inspection of passers-by. Two recently stopped a young
Beijing woman as she walked down the street because she resembles a
wanted student leader. They let her go after checking her
identification.
   Many work units have appointed people to take charge of security.
Any newcomer looking for temporary work is likely to be scrutinized
far more carefully than usual.
   Customs officials have been ordered to be especially alert for
fugitives seeking to leave the country. This week, officials at the
Beijing airport arrested four people with alleged ``ties to the
counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' according to Wednesday's Beijing
Daily.
   Two of them, Liu Xiaoqiu, 27, and Lu Zhuru, 29, had tickets for
Paris. The women were caught because an official noted their
passports had false border entry stamps.
   It turned out the passports belonged to two other women, who had
left China and mailed the passports back. But the passports lacked
entry stamps, so Miss Liu and Miss Lu allegedly faked them.
   The greatest threat to student activists and other protesters on
the run is the intense nationwide government propaganda campaign
that apparently has convinced many people the crackdown was
justified.
   When the government called on TV viewers to help find a man
accused of rumor-mongering and flashed his picture on the screen,
two women quickly stepped forward to point him out.
   When student activist Zhou Fengsuo's name was placed on the
wanted circular, his sister and brother-in-law turned him in.
   Newspapers and broadcasts repeatedly have called on the public to
report ``rebels,'' creating the temptation to report a neighbor and
win the praise and possibly the favor of authorities. That can be
important to obtaining housing and other scarce goods.
   Even people who might be disposed to ignore that the next-door
neighbors are harboring a stranger face the pressure of knowing that
if they don't report it, someone else probably will. Then they will
come under suspicion for having been silent.

   In the school year that ends next week the city's
940,000 public school students have been taught lesson after lesson
about larceny, bribery, weapons possession, sexual harassment, drug
abuse and political corruption.
   Their teachers have included the Bronx school board members who
allegedly stole a baby grand piano from a school, and the one who
lived in a box near a highway; the 5-year-old student who brought a
loaded pistol to school, and the 11-year-old found with $4,000 worth
of crack in his lunch bag; the principal arrested for buying crack
near his apartment and the veteran teacher arrested for snorting
cocaine in a school teachers' parking lot; and the voters of New
York City, who avoided school board election polls as if they were
plague wards.
   The students also learned something about the absurdity and
futility of life when the man charged with transforming this
depraved curriculum, Schools Chancellor Richard Green, suddenly
dropped dead.
   As the year ended, the lessons seemed to be piling up faster than
anyone could master them.
   On Tuesday alone:
   _The statewide Regents achievement test in chemistry was canceled
after copies of answer sheets were stolen and hawked like baseball
programs. A copy even turned up on the front page of the New York
Post, which said it took a reporter all of 15 minutes to locate a
student who would sell a copy.
   _An undercover investigator reported that he was able to vote 33
times at 33 different voting sites in last month's local school
board elections. He simply registered under dozens of fake names.
   _An appeals court reinstated a law barring school employees and
political officeholders from the boards, thus voiding the election
of about 18 officials.
   Even by local standards, it was a bad year. The 1988-89 New York
school calendar included:
   Sept. 30: Students learn they must wait a half a year _ until
January _ to get some supplies, despite a program to give teachers
money to speed up delivery.
   Oct. 25: The Board of Education, alarmed by the rising number of
weapons in schools, announces plans to spend $2.8 million on metal
detectors.
   Nov. 9: Bronx school principal Matthew Barnwell is arrested by
police who say he bought two vials of crack near his Harlem
apartment. Barnwell previously had been suspended three times, and
once logged 100 unexplained absences or late arrivals in a single
school year.
   Nov. 14: A Bronx school aide tells authorities she was
transferred and denied a promotion because she rejected the sexual
advances of a local school board member.
   Nov. 23: Green suspends the local school board in the Morrisania
section of the South Bronx, citing a grand jury investigation into
allegations that some board members used and distributed illegal
drugs, stole school equipment and extorted political contributions
from teachers, principals and other employees.
   Nov. 30: Newspapers report that a Bronx school board member lived
for several weeks in a cardboard box alongside a highway, and has
since disappeared entirely. She continued to receive $125 a month
board stipend even though she had not attended a board meeting for
six months.
   Dec. 9: An East Harlem school district superintendent and a
school board member are alleged to have used a secret school fund to
pay for personal expenses, including a ``sweet 16'' party and a
Tiffany bracelet. The district was singled out by the White House
last year as a national model.
   Jan. 13: A 5-year-old kindergartner is found carrying a loaded
.25-caliber pistol in the cafeteria of a Bronx elementary school.
   Jan. 20: Four Bronx school board members and a former district
superintendent are indicted on a variety of criminal charges. One
board member is charged with soliciting bribes from a textbook
publisher.
   March 14: The head of a Bronx local board is indicted on charges
that he sought a bribe from an acting assistant principal to allow
her to hold her job after she failed an exam; an 11-year-old Bronx
student is arrested after he is caught with 411 vials of crack in
his lunch bag.
   May 2: Despite a campaign to get out the vote, only 7 percent of
eligible voters turn out for neighborhood school board elections _
the lowest turnout since the elections began two decades ago.
Despite reports of rampant corruption and cronyism, the vast
majority of incumbents are re-elected.
   May 8: Barnwell's case ends in mistrial; reassigned, he continues
to draw $61,000 annual salary.
   May 10: Green dies in an asthma attack only 14 months after
becoming chancellor.
   May 23: A third-grader at a Bronx school finds 19 crack vials on
a urinal.
   June 19: State auditors say half the complaints of corruption
received by the central Board of Education apparently were never
investigated.
   As the school year ended, all of the local school boards in the
Bronx were under investigation _ two had been suspended _ as were
six others around the city. One hundred and twenty-four teachers and
administrators had been fired or faced disciplinary action.
Statistics on school violence were still being computed.

   Seven semiconductor companies
announced Wednesday they plan to join forces in an unprecedented
venture to produce computer memory chips and ease the chokehold
Japan has on that vital market.
   The firms contributed ``seed money'' for the establishment of
U.S. Memories Inc., a corporation that will make the memory chips
known as DRAMs that are crucial to the U.S. electronic and defense
industries.
   ``It is clear that the time is right for a collective memory
manufacturing venture in the United States to improve America's
market position in what is truly a critical technology,'' said
Sanford L. Kane, president and chief executive officer of the newly
formed company.
   If approved, the venture would break new ground in the federal
government's attitude toward cooperation between competing
companies. The government has been getting steadily more permissive
toward deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the
theory that concerted action is necessary to meet foreign
competition.
   ``At this point we don't know enough about the transaction to
comment one way or the other,'' Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for the
Justice Department's antitrust division, said Wednesday.
   Either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission is
likely to look at the deal, although not necessarily conduct a
full-scale investigation, she said.
   The corporation's preliminary business plan calls for the
completion of a plant in 1990 and high-volume production of the
dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, to begin in the first
half of 1991.
   Kane said the corporation's first product will be standard
4-megabit DRAMs based on design and manufacturing technology to be
licensed from International Business Machines Corp.
   The plan also says that U.S. Memories expects to raise roughly
$500 million from companies that invest in the corporation and $500
million from borrowings.
   Memory chips are a vital link of the electronics ``food chain,''
and many U.S. industry and government officials say it is
unacceptable to rely heavily on chips made in Japan for computers,
work stations, military gear and other products.
   Japanese firms control nearly 80 percent of the worldwide DRAM
market, which they were able to dominate by sustaining $4 billion in
losses in 1985-86 to knock out their American competition, according
to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
   The number of U.S. companies producing DRAMs for sale on the open
market, an area in which they once were leaders, fell dramatically
from 11 in 1980 to three this year. The three are Texas Instruments
Inc., Micron Technologies Inc., and Motorola Inc., which recently
re-entered the business.
   IBM is a huge manufacturer of DRAMs, but only for internal use.
Kane, who will be its chief executive, was formerly a vice president
of industry operations for IBM's General Technology Division.
   The companies that gave money to plan the corporation were
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM, Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and National
Semiconductor Corp.
   Kane said the seven partners must stillobtain enough funds to
launch the venture, successfully negotiate a technology transfer
agreement with IBM, create a detailed business plan and get a
favorable antitrust agreement.
   ``It is absolutely clear that we'll need more than the seven we
have now,'' he added.
   Kane said U.S. Memories would work closely with Sematech, the
Austin, Texas-based research consortium that was one of the first
such cooperative efforts in the United States. Sematech makes small
quantities of chips to test manufacturing processes and equipment.
   Contacted in Tokyo on Thursday, a spokesman for NEC Corp.,
Japan's largest semiconductor maker, said he could not comment
because ``there are too many unknown things'' about the venture.
   The Electronic Industries Association of Japan, a major grouping
of semiconductor companies and other electronics makers, also had
``no specific comment'' on a U.S. venture because ``details have yet
to be known,'' a spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters sweating in 118-degree
temperatures Wednesday contained a 935-acre wildfire that briefly
threatened a national park.
   Residents in 85 homes were advised to evacuate at the height of
the fire near Joshua Tree National Monument, which is dedicated to
preservation of the gnarled desert trees, but only one building was
destroyed.
   ``The residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if
it hadn't been for that clearance the homes would definitely have
burned,'' said Deborah McClellan of the California Department of
Forestry.
   Temperatures reached above 100 inland and into the high 80s and
90-degree mark elsewhere, and gusty Santa Ana winds hampered
firefighters as they fought several other brush fires.
   Fire blackened 175 acres in the hills of San Clemente in southern
Orange County and 35 acres in Santa Clarita in northwestern Los
Angeles County. Firefighters earlier doused a 300-acre blaze in
Ventura County and a 115-acre fire in San Bernardino County.
   Northern California was also subject to the same hot, gusty winds
and low humidity which helped fan 2,600-acre wildfire 50 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   Heavy smoke from the grass fire forced closure of a 10-mile
stretch of state Highway 12, authorities said. State Route 20 in the
Sierra was closed for 30 miles while firefighters tried to contain a
blaze on both sides of the highway.
   Two families were briefly evacuated from their homes in the
farming community of Denverton, said Marcia Chadbourne, spokeswoman
for the Solano County Office of Emergency Services.
   Other smaller fires were reported in the city of Vacaville, near
the retirement community of Rossmoor and in the Sunol-Castlewood
area near Pleasanton.

   Members of the directors union who work in most
of the country's regional theaters have rejected a final contract
offer from the theaters but will go into rehearsal with new
productions until Aug. 8.
   The contract offer was rejected Monday by members of the Society
of Stage Directors and Choreographers, which said it still was
willing to met with the League of Resident Theaters. The last
contract expired in April 1988 but was extended to May 26 of this
year.
   At the time, the union said it would withhold the services of its
members from plays that had not yet gone into rehearsal. It later
decided to allow its members to go into rehearsal until the August
date.
   Among the issues left unresolved are fees and union coverage in
smaller league theaters for the directors and choreographers.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov is leaving as artistic
director of the American Ballet Theatre at the end of the 1990
season.
   The company's board of trustees announced the departure
Wednesday, a day after Baryshnikov told them of his decision to
leave.
   Baryshnikov, 41, became ABT's artistic director in September
1980. He joined the company in 1974 after defecting from the Soviet
Union, where he danced with the Kirov ballet company.
   ``I will have given 10 years to the company, and it has been a
true challenge,'' he said. ``The dancers in the company are superb.
Of all the responsibilities associated with being artistic director,
I've enjoyed working with the dancers more than anything else.''
   Baryshnikov said he would ``pursue other professional options''
but did not elaborate.
   He is starring on Broadway in ``Metamorphosis,'' a play based on
Franz Kafka's story, and has appeared in such films as ``White
Nights'' and ``The Turning Point.'' He also recently started a
perfume for women called ``Misha,'' his nickname.

   First lady Barbara Bush told a group of
underprivileged college-bound high school students she hopes to see
one of them at the White House during the next four years as a
Presidential Scholar.
   ``If you work hard and keep up your grades I'm sure you can. That
will be a thrill,'' she said Wednesday as she addressed 100 of the
students known as ``Taylor's Kids.''
   The students, once labeled as underachievers, are part of a group
that accepted a challenge from millionaire oilman Pat Taylor of New
Orleans.
   Taylor promised 200 students at a New Orleans school last year
that he would pay their way through college if they maintained a
``B'' average through high school.
   Earlier Wednesday, Mrs. Bush received the 1989 Museum Volunteers
Award from the American Association of Museum Volunteers.

   ``I didn't believe it at first, but this has made a believer out
of me,'' seventh-grader Matt Gleason of Baton Rouge said Wednesday.
``This is the first time I've won anything.''
   The youngster and his family received a lifetime pass to any
Disney theme park.
   The family was greeted by actor-comedian Harvey Korman, treated
to lunch, driven in a motorcade down Hollywood Boulevard and taken
on a backstage tour of the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
   The tourist resort, which now has three theme parks, reached the
200-million mark in attendance in 1985. The park opened in 1971.

   Royer, 48, will succeed Shirley Williams, who has been acting
director since Dick Thornburgh was appointed U.S. attorney general
in August 1988.
   ``I'm sure that like his predecessors, Dick Thornburgh and
Shirley Williams, he will work to ensure that understanding, and
inspiring students to participate in elective politics is a central

Wednesday.
   As Seattle's mayor for 12 years, Royer has been a member of the
Democratic National Committee, representing the National Conference
of Democratic Mayors, and also served on the 1988 Democratic
National Platform Committee. Royer served as president of the
National League of Cities in 1983.

   Alice doesn't cook here anymore, but
this sleepy western Massachusetts town, captured in paint by Norman
Rockwell and in song by Arlo Guthrie, celebrates its 250th birthday
this weekend.
   Some things have changed since the days when Rockwell made
Stockbridge famous to Saturday Evening Post readers.
   Police Chief William J. Obanhein, whose visage Rockwell used as
the model of the ``perfect Secret Service man'' and whose
enforcement of the litter laws inspired Arlo Guthrie's ballad
``Alice's Restaurant,'' has retired. Alice Brock herself no longer
has a restaurant.
   Dr. Donald E. Campbell, captured by Rockwell while aiming a
hypodermic needle at a bare-bottomed youngster scrutinizing his
medical degrees, made his last house call in February on his 83rd
birthday.
   But the cat and dog fountain still stands. So does the horse
trough proclaiming ``utility is preferable to glamor'' and the line
of cane rockers on the veranda of the Red Lion Inn.
   Stockbridge's charm has proved irresistible to thousands of
tourists, who sometimes turn Main Street into a bumper-to-bumper
traffic jam.
   But for about two hours Saturday, Stockbridge will reclaim the
thoroughfare for a gala parade of brass bands, Boy Scouts, floats,
and more than 500 marchers.
   An old-fashioned picnic and fireworks also are planned.
   Asked to explain Stockbridge's appeal, Selectman Norman
Charbonneau responded: ``The people. And the uniqueness of the
area.''
   Guthrie agreed.
   ``I grew up in Stockbridge and have spent most of my life near
there,'' Guthrie said in a telephone interview from his nearby
Berkshire Hills home. ``Most of the people in town are wonderful and
fabulous ...
   ``It's a place that has retained its turn-of-the-century beauty
and sense of history. It's always accommodated a wide variety of
people _ artists, wealthy ambassadors, mobsters running booze during
Prohibition _ but it does so very reluctantly.
   ``And in some ways that's just fine. When I was young I didn't
understand that kind of small-town politics, but I've learned to
actually like it.''
   Guthrie, now the father of teenagers, said Stockbridge is ``more
a town for older folks,'' adding:
   ``I don't recall there being a whole lot to do for a young person
and there probably still isn't. I don't think my kids ever go to
Stockbridge.''
   But Guthrie, who will sing ``Alice's Restaurant'' at a July 4
concert in nearby Tanglewood, can still cackle gleefully in
anticipation of the town's reaction to his summer plans to market
T-shirts emblazoned ``with the Trail of the Garbage'' that will lead
tourists on the path of his crime.
   ``It will be sort of our own version of the Freedom Trail (in
Boston),'' he said.

<HEAD>Freedoms Symbolized by American Flag Include Right to Desecrate It</HEAD>

   They call her Old Glory. She has flown proudly
from masts of America's ships, waved defiantly from her battlements,
lain sadly across her coffins. For 202 years the flag has inspired _
``Oh, say, can you see'' _ but she also has been spat on, stepped
on, torn and defiled.
   The flag has been flown upside down in derision, not just
distress; it has been exploited in advertisements, desecrated with
unseemly mottoes and burned by enemies without and protesters
within. It has been a political issue, a legal issue and
pseudo-patriots have been accused of hiding behind it.
   It ``waves'' for all eternity on the airless surface of the moon.
   And now, the highest court in the land _ divided 5-4 _ has
decreed that the freedoms symbolized by the flag protect the very
people who burn it as a form of political protest.
   ``We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem
represents,'' said William J. Brennan, the most senior of the
justices, in the majority opinion.
   And Justice John Paul Stevens, in dissenting, said that condoning
descecration of the flag ``will tarnish its value _ both for those
who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to
don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.''
   The case before the court involved the burning of a flag at the
Republican National Convention in Dallas in 1984, in which
protesters chanted ``America, the red, white and blue; We spit on
you.''
   That same year the McDonald's restaurant chain got some flak for
lowering the American flag to half staff to observe the death of its
founder, Ray Kroc.
   The difficulty the justices faced in reaching agreement mirrors
the shifting of American attitudes toward the Stars and Stripes.
Until the Vietnam generation, Americans venerated the flag. A flag
was burned only because it was old _ and then to spare it the
indignity of being thrown into the garbage can.
   The burning flag, however, became a searing symbol of the dissent
over the Vietnam war, serving to further polarize those who regarded
the flag with awe. It was a schism that remains today.
   Recall the part the flag played last year in the presidential
campaign.
   There was the suggestion by Sen. Steve Symms of Idaho, a
Republican, that Kitty Dukakis, wife of the Democratic candidate,
had burned the American flag while she was an anti-war demonstrator
during the 1960s.
   The Dukakis campaign was forced to respond that the suggestion
was ``totally false and beneath contempt'' and that she regarded the
flag as ``a symbol of our nation's commitment to freedom.'' Symms
later admitted the story was only something he had heard and that he
had no proof.
   Michael Dukakis also took the heat for opposing a Massachussets
bill to require daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the
school. Dukakis pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said a
forced pledge was unconstitutional, but it was a fine distinction
that swayed few voters.
   George Bush went to a flag factory, and recited the Pledge of
Allegiance at innumerable campaign stops.
   He won.
   In Chicago, last March, an exhibit at the Art Institute featured
a flag positioned on the floor in front of a book asking viewers to
write their opinions on ``What is the proper way to display a U.S.
flag.'' The exhibit _ called ``How to display `Dread' Scott Tyler'`
sparked strong protests, with one woman writing:
   ``An artist he is not, this Dread Scott. He is an unpatriotic
snot. He knows not what this country is about.'' Another wrote: ``I
would do anything short of killing you to stop you.''
   The exhibit prompted a march on the institute with demonstrators
chanting ``Hut, two, three, four; get the flag off the floor.''
   The flag as a freedom-of-speech issue was strongest in the
Vietnam days.
   In Mineola, N.Y., a woman was handcuffed, searched, fingerprinted
and jailed for flying the flag upside down during a nationwide
moratorium observance by opponents of the Vietnam war. She was freed
by a judge who ruled her act was not defilement, but a distress
signal.
   In Philadelphia, the state Supreme Court threw out the conviction
of a man for displaying a flag on which he had written, ``make love,
not war.''
   The Monmouth County Board of Freeholders in New Jersey decided it
wouldn't allow citizens to speak at its public meetings if they
didn't take part in flag ceremonies that began each session.
   A 19-year-old resident who strolled through Leominster, Mass.,
with an American flag sewn to the seat of his pants was sentenced to
a year in jail. The law, passed in 1899, forbade treating the flag
in a contemptuous manner.
   Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman, who died recently, was convicted of
defiling the flag _ wearing a shirt made in the design of the flag
when he showed up for a hearing of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities. The conviction was overturned.
   Passions ran so high in a southern New Jersey county that the
governing board voted to require all county-owned cars to carry flag
decals with the slogan ``Our Flag: Love it or Leave.''
   But in Minnesota, the state Supreme Court upheld the ``defacing''
conviction of a youth who painted a white peace symbol over the
field of stars. A judge who dissented said, ``patriotism is not
instilled by statute.''
   And the ultimate in disappointments came in 1987 to a Taiwanese
company that found it difficult to sell American flags labeled
``Made in Taiwan.'' The company offered its American distributors
``Made in USA'' labels, but they wouldn't bite.

<HEAD>US Skeptical of Soviet Proposal to Consult UN Council on Palestinian
Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States is skeptical of a Soviet
proposal to seek advice from the United Nations Security Council's
permanent members on proposed elections among Palestinian Arabs on
the West Bank and in Gaza, administration sources say.
   ``We said we weren't interested,'' an official said late
Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, did not reject the idea outright but said it would not
get anywhere ``as far as we're concerned.''
   The official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold
elections to choose Palestinian representatives to negotiate
self-rule with Israel.
   ``It would only muddy the waters and distract from the
(elections) idea itself,'' the official said.
   Participation by the council members would guarantee the Soviet
Union a role that Israel fears would be used to the advantage of the
Arabs.
   The five members of the Security Council are the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   The Soviets, without committing themselves on Palestinian
elections, made their proposal during a two-day meeting in
Washington last week on the Middle East. It was one in a series of
conferences on various global problems arranged by the two
superpowers.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by John Kelly, assistant secretary
of state for the Near East, and Dennis Ross, head of the
department's policy planning staff. Vladimir Polyakov, senior expert
on the Middle East in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, led his
government's delegation.
   The Soviet idea was first disclosed in Thursday editions of The
Star Tribune of Minneapolis.
   The elections were proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir as a way of breaking the stalemate between the Arabs and
Israel. The idea has qualified U.S. support, provided arrangements
are satisfactory to the Palestinians and the Arab countries.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has rejected Israel's offer
as a subterfuge to block the creation of a Palestinian state. But
the Bush administration is operating on the assumption that the
Shamir proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only
known vehicle for starting negotiations.
   For this reason, the official said, the Soviet proposal to
consult the U.N. Security Council members on a proper framework
received a skeptical U.S. response.
   The official said the Soviets did not endorse or reject Shamir's
proposition. As in the past, the Soviets said only that it was
``worthy of consideration.''
   In the past, as an inducement to Israel, the Soviets have said
they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once
negotiations began. But the official said the Soviets did not repeat
this offer in the Washington sessions.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel in 1967 when Israel
defeated a combination of Arab countries in a six-day war.

<TEXT>
   The share of first pregnancies beginning out of
wedlock has risen sharply in the 1980s and single pregnant women are
no longer rushing to the altar, a new Census Bureau study shows.
   There has been a significant rise in the share of first births
out of wedlock during the last two decades, while the share of women
who tie the knot between conception and birth has been on a decline.
   The census report also found a jump in the birth rate among women
in their 30s, noting that most women who had a baby in 1988 were in
the work force. It found that minorities tend to have higher birth
rates than whites and that nearly three-quarters of recent births to
black women between 15 and 29 were out of wedlock.
   Overall, the national fertility rate was 69.7 births per 1,000
women age 18 to 44 during the year ending in June 1988, according to
the report, ``Fertility of American Women: June 1988.''
   Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 women
during this decade and the 69.7 for 1988 is not considered
significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before.
   But the profile of women becoming mothers in the United States
has changed.
   For women age 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of first
births were conceived out of marriage between 1985 and 1988.
   That's up from just more than 30 percent when the measure was
first taken, between 1970 and 1974, the report said.
   The major change occurred among women who gave birth out of
wedlock, a share which increased from 17.9 percent of first mothers
in the early 1970s to 28.3 percent between 1985 and 1988.
   At the same time the share of unwed mothers was rising, the
percentage of women who got married after they became pregnant but
before they gave birth dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7 percent of
first mothers.
   This shift ``may reflect the opinion of some women that they may
be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of
their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance
than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely
to prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' reported bureau analyst Amara
Bachu.
   The share of single first mothers varied sharply by race, the
study also found.
   Among black women, 74.6 percent of first births to women age 15
to 29 occurred out of wedlock between 1985 and 1988. That's up from
54.1 percent between 1970 and 1974.
   For Hispanic women the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7
percent. And white women recorded 19.6 percent premarital births, up
from 11.5 percent.
   The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women
postponing births as they pursue educations and careers.
   The ``increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggest
that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately
postponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report concluded.
   For women age 30 to 34 the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 births
per 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar,
though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39.
   The bureau also asked women about their plans for families and
reported that, among childless wives age 25 to 29, 85 percent still
expect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent who
expected a future birth in this age group in 1975.
   And among married women in their early 30s, the share who expect
to have a child someday rose to 54.4 percent from 33.5 percent since
1975.
   Nevertheless, the study concludes, ``the question remains: How
strong is the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and
childless for several years?''
   For women age 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent of
women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from just 38
percent in 1980.
   ``Labor force participation for among women with newborn children
is appreciably higher for college-educated women than for women''
with less education, the report found.
   Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in
the labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school graduates
and 34 percent who had not finished high school.
   By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force,
compared to 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Confiscate Opposition Leaders' Coffee Plantations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cracking down on its critics, the
leftist Sandinista government says it has confiscated coffee
plantations and other property belonging to three opposition
business leaders.
   The three _ Nicolas Bolanos, Jaime Cuadra and Arnoldo Aleman _
were linked to the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, an
opposition group, and have been sharply critical of government
regulation of the coffee industry.
   The confiscation announcement Wednesday came three days after
coffee growers from all over the country decided to pull out of the
National Coffee Commission, calling the regulatory and
development-oriented panel useless.
   An order signed by Agriculture Development Minister Jaime
Wheelock and read on state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio declared the
properties of the three men of ``public utility and social
interest.'' It did not mention compensation.
   At a meeting Sunday in Matagalpa, 80 miles north of the capital,
coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the National
Coffee Commission. They said the panel, made up of government and
private representatives, had ruined the industry.
   At the meeting, Bolanos accused the government of causing a
severe economic crisis through mismanagement, adding that only a
``government of national salvation'' replacing the Sandinistas could
bring Nicaragua out of recession.
   Coffee is one of Nicaragua's main export items and a principal
dollar-earner.
   Commenting on the confiscation order, the Voice of Nicaragua
accused leaders of the coffee growers of ``urging chaos, disorder,
price gouging, smuggling and speculation'' in the industry.
   The properties were ordered confiscated because these leadaers
``adopted irresponsible attitude that was fomenting anarchy in the
coffee industry at a time when the country is going through an
economic crisis.''
   In a speech Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega said ``all
anti-patriotic coffee growers will not receive a single cent'' in
credit from the State Development Bank.
   Ortega accused the growers of trying to sabotage an economic
austerity plan to reduce inflation, which last year topped 10,000
percent.
   As part of the plan, the Sandinista government earlier this week
ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency, which
sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing.
   Enrique Bolanos, the brother of Nicolas Bolanos, called the
confiscations ``an act of vengeance by the Sandinistas over what
happened at the assembly in Matagalpa.''
   Enrique Bolanos, a former chairman of the Superior Council of
Private Enterprise, had some of his properties in the eastern
province of Masaya confiscated by the Sandinistas some years ago.
   In June 1988, the Sandinista government confiscated the San
Antonio sugar plantation and mills, one of Nicaragua's largest
industries. Sugar is also an important export item.

<HEAD>Fresh From Democratic Kills, Republicans Turn Sights on GOP Lawmaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans are seeking to turn a
liability into an asset with the case of Donald E. Lukens, the Ohio
GOP lawmaker convicted on charges involving sex with a 16-year-old
girl.
   The Republican conference on Wednesday made a preemptive strike,
voting to force an ethics investigation of their colleague before
Democrats could do the same or the ethics committee did so on its
own.
   Now, they are looking to Democrats to spotlight some of their own
colleagues as ethics violators.
   ``I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the
other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing
that is involved in what our conference did,'' said Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa., a member of the GOP leadership.
   Democrats don't seem to be biting.
   ``There is no calculation that one can properly make that ethical
problems or concerns are more emphatic in one party than another,''
said Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   ``That's absolute nonsense, and the public knows it, and it's I
think a very unfortunate attempt to try to achieve a political
point, apparently at the expense of one of their own members.''
   Newly elected Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland
was more blunt: ``I'm sure Democrats are prepared to kick out their
own members who are convicted of sexually abusing children.''
   Republicans have sought to make ethics a primary issue in the
101st Congress, hoping to capitalize politically on the allegations
of ethical misconduct against former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and former Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.
   But the next two cases likely to come before the ethics panel
feature Republicans: Lukens and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, who is alleged to have set up an improper partnership to
promote a book he wrote.
   Lukens was convicted May 30 in Franklin County, Ohio, of
contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor, after a
jury found he had sex with the girl at his Columbus apartment last
November. Lukens, 58 and divorced, is appealing the conviction.
   Democrats believe that in political terms, Lukens' case has in
some ways been more objectionable to the public than the allegations
involving Wright and Coelho, which involved complicated financial
transactions.
   Local and state Republican officials in Ohio, clearly embarrassed
by Lukens, have called on him to resign and warned he would not be
renominated to his seat in 1990.
   Traditionally, members convicted in court of wrongdoing are dealt
with speedily by the ethics committee, which can apply sanctions
ranging from a reprimand to expulsion from the House.
   But Lukens has vowed to fight the charges, and his spokesman said
Wednesday's action was welcome because an ethics probe could ``once
and for all bring forth the truth about this entire episode.''
   The spokesman, William Jarrell, said Lukens was hampered in court
because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and
credibility of the girl and her mother, who were Lukens' accusers.
``Now we'll be able to bring forth the background and the motives,''
he said.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court
decision Wednesday that gave constitutional protection to the
burning of the American flag as a form of political protest.
   From Justice William J. Brennan's majority opinion:
   After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political
protest, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of desecrating a flag in
violation of Texas law. This case presents the question whether his
conviction is consistent with the First Amendment. We hold that it
is not.
   Texas claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the
peace justifies Johnson's conviction. However, no disturbance of the
peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson's
burning of the flag. We have not permitted the government to assume
that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but
have instead required careful consideration of the actual
circumstances surrounding such expression.
   Johnson was prosecuted because he knew that his politically
charged expression would cause serious offense. If he had burned the
flag as a means of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he
would not have been convicted. The Texas law is thus not aimed at
protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances,
but is designed instead to protect it only against impairments that
would cause serious offense to others.
   Nothing in our opinion should be taken to suggest that one is
free to steal a flag so long as one later uses it to communicate an
idea. We also emphasize that Johnson was prosecuted only for flag
desecration _ not for trespass, disorderly conduct or arson.
   If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment,
it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or
disagreeable.
   We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag
that waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag-burner's
message than by saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of
preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by _ as one
witness here did _ according its remains a respectful burial.
   We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for
in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem
represents.
   From Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's concurring opinion:
   The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not
like. We make them because they are right, right in the sense that
the law and the Constitution, as we see them, compel the result.
   It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who
hold it in contempt.
   From Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's dissenting opinion:
   For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique
position as the symbol of our nation, a uniqueness that justifies a
governmental prohibition against flag burning in a way Johnson did
here.
   No other American symbol has been as universally honored as the
flag. Both Congress and the state have enacted numerous laws
regulating misuse of the American flag. With the exception of Alaska
and Wyoming, all the states now have statutes prohibiting the
burning of the flag.
   Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost
mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or
philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the First
Amendment invalidates (an) act of Congress and the laws of 48 of the
50 states, which make criminal the public burning of the flag.
   From Justice John Paul Stevens' dissenting opinion:
   A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national
unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society
that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has
animated the growth and power of those ideas.
   It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious
tolerance, and of goodwill for other peoples who share our
aspirations. The symbol carries its message to dissidents both at
home and abroad who may have no interest at all in our national
unity or survival.
   The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. Conceivably
that value will be enhanced by the court's conclusion that our
national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the
United States as ultimate guarantor of that freedom is without power
to prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol. But I am
unpersuaded.
   The creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and
graffiti on the Washington Monument might enlarge the market for
free expression, but at a cost I would not pay. Similarly, in my
considered judgment, sanctioning the public desecration of the flag
will tarnish its value _ both for those who cherish the ideas for
which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of
martyrdom by burning it.

<HEAD>Committee Debates Bill to Forbid Cleanup Writeoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irate members of Congress are moving to ensure
the Exxon Corp. pays the full cost of cleaning up the Alaska oil
spill.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., pleaded Wednesday for fellow senators to
support a law that would deny Exxon a tax writeoff for expenses of
cleaning up the spill, the largest in the nation's history.
   ``I do not want to tell my constituents that the American people
owe Exxon, the biggest polluter in history, millions of dollars in a
tax rebate in return for destroying the environment and raising
prices at the gas pumps,'' Reid told the Senate Finance Committee.
   Reid is chief sponsor of a bill that would prohibit Exxon from
deducting costs of cleaning up the spill unless the federal
government certified the cleanup meets standards of the Clean Water
Act or other federal laws.
   In the House, Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., said Wednesday
he and 61 congressional colleagues have asked the federal government
to sue Exxon and the Alyeska Pipeline Service for the cost of
environmental damage to Prince William Sound and the surrounding
Alaskan wilderness.
   The congressmen said in a letter to Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan Jr. and the Justice Department that the government shouuld get
``a full recovery of the money necessary to restore or replace the
lost resources.''
   ``My interest is not simple vengeance,'' Torricelli said. ``It is
rather providing the only genuine incentive that will ever prevent
the repetition of the Valdez tragedy.''
   Exxon has been criticized for what some have called a slowness to
respond to the March 24 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude
oil from the Exxon Valdez tanker into Prince William Sound.
   Exxon has spent more than $200 million to clean up the mess,
company officials said Wednesday. An undetermined portion will be
reimbursed by insurance and the uninsured expenses may be deducted
from taxable income as a cost of doing business.
   Since the top federal corporate tax rate is 34 percent, the
effect will be for taxpayers to pay 34 percent of the uninsured
expense.
   The Bush administration opposes the Senate bill to restrain
Exxon's ability to write off the cleanup costs.
   ``The bill would violate the fundamental principle of business
taxation, that a taxpayer's ordinary and necessary business expenses
may be deducted in computing net income,'' Kenneth W. Gideon,
assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, told the Finance
Committee.
   Charles J. DiBona, president of American Petroleum Institute,
which represents the nation's major oil companies, said the bill
``sends the message that whatever cleanup costs a taxpayer incurs,
he runs the risk of having them denied at some future time because
he does not or cannot meet standards ... determined by the
commandant of the Coast Guard or the administrator of the
Enviromental Protection Agency.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he supports Reid's bill but
ackowledged that existing environmental laws contain no objective
standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper.
   The committee did not indicate when it will act on the bill.
   Also on Wednesday, the major oil companies criticized a House
panel's move to ban oil exploration in Alaska's Bristol Bay and
areas off the coasts of California, Florida and the mid-Atlantic
states.
   The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group of big oil
companies, called the action ``unwise, unjustified and ultimately
counterproductive to the country's energy security.'' Environmental
groups applauded the proposed bans.
   The House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior voted
Wednesday to stop oil companies from drilling in Bristol Bay for one
year on lease blocks purchased from the Interior Department last
October. About $95 million was invested in the leases.

<HEAD>Toxic Chemical is No Longer Toxic, EPA Decides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a single sweep of the regulatory hand, the
Environmental Protection Agency has cut in half the amount of toxic
chemicals that are released into the air, soil and water from
industrial plants.
   It's not that the volume of chemical pollutants is any less, but
as of today some 12 billion pounds _ nearly 54 percent of all toxic
chemicals released in 1987 _ no longer are considered toxic.
   The EPA on Wednesday officially declared sodium sulfate as not
posing health concerns that warrant it being in the company of such
toxic chemicals as sulfuric acid, chlorine, lead and a variety of
carcinogens.
   The chemical, which is widely used as an agent and byproduct in a
variety of manufacturing processes including the production of
paper, glass and detergents, dominated the statistics announced
recently on toxic chemical releases from industrial facilities.
   It was the reason that chemical discharges released into water
dwarfed releases into the air and soil; it was why California was
ranked as the state with by far the greatest amount of toxic
chemical releases; and it was why the total volume of releases
nationwide exceeded 22.5 billion pounds instead of closer to 10.5
billion pounds.
   The reclassification of sodium sulfate may be only the first of
several such actions. The EPA also is reviewing whether two other
chemicals high on the toxic release list _ aluminum oxide and
ammonium sulfate _ should be taken off the list.
   Aluminum oxide accounted for 2.4 billion pounds of toxic chemical
releases by industry in 1987, nearly 11 percent of the total, and
ammonium sulfate accounted for 918 million pounds, about 4 percent
of the total, according to the EPA.
   The EPA has proposed deleting aluminum oxide from the list,
although no final action has been taken. It has not yet responded to
a petition by the chemical industry to delete ammonium sulfate, said
Robert Israel, an EPA official involved in the petition process.
   Because the EPA has taken sodium sulfate off its toxic chemical
list, companies will not have to include releases of the chemical
into the air, water and soil when they produce their release
statistics for 1988 at the end of this month.
   The chemical industry had petitioned the EPA to reclassify sodium
sulfate, arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a
significant health threat.
   The action by the EPA had been expected. The agency staff in
April had recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being
nontoxic ``due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity
concerns'' about the chemical.
   Israel said in an interview the agency concluded that sodium
sulfate ``did not meet the health or environmental toxicity
criteria'' for a chemical to be on the toxic list.
   The absence of sodium sulfate from the EPA toxic chemical list _
which now includes 327 chemicals _ will result in significant
changes in the national profile on toxic releases, agency officials
said.
   For example, the state with the most toxic chemical releases was
California with 5.8 billion pounds, more than a fourth of all the
releases in the country. But most of the discharges were of sodium
sulfate. With the chemical no longer classified as toxic, California
drops from being the biggest polluter to ninth, according to the EPA.
   Water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical
releases in 1987 largely because three-fourths of all releases of
sodium sulfate were into surface water. Without sodium sulfate,
water releases will rank far behind toxic chemical discharges into
the air, which now assumes the No. 1 spot accounting for about
one-fourth of all such releases from industrial plants.

<HEAD>Antique Dealer Sees Nothing Wrong with Trying to Sell Mummy</HEAD>

   Harlan Berk doesn't like to think of the dusty,
diminutive Egyptian mummy for sale at his downtown coin and antique
shop as a body.
   ``It's wrapped, and I try to think of it as a piece of
antiquity,'' said Berk, standing near the Plexiglas table that for a
month has been the resting place for the ancient remains of a woman.
``I try to look at the artwork on the outer wrappings and not focus
on the more macabre aspects.''
   He's asking $50,000 for it, adding, ``The market will tell me if
I'm right or wrong.''
   He hopes to sell the mummy to a museum or university.
   John Larson, archivist and Egyptologist at the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute Museum, said it is illegal to export
mummies from Egypt without Egyptian government permission.
   But until well into this century, more ``laissez faire'' rules
applied.
   Berk, an antique dealer, said he bought the mummy from an
Illinois family a month ago, and considers himself free to sell it
at his shop. He said he was told that a family member brought the
mummy back from Egypt about 60 years ago.
   The mummy, at 4-feet, 1-inch, looks smaller than lifesize as it
rests on the table in a temperature-controlled room.
   On the front are remnants of the pinkish paint and gold leaf used
for decoration, with some pictures of Egyptian gods including Horus,
the god of heaven; and Osiris, the god of vegetation and later of
death.
   The pictures tell a story of life, death and rebirth _ paths the
long-dead woman's loved ones likely envisioned for her, Berk said.
   ``We do have respect for the individual, even though she's been
deceased for several thousand years.''
   Larson said he understands why some are disturbed by the sale of
human remains, particulary those of American Indians only a couple
generations old.
   ``I don't think any of us would want to see our grandparents'
bodies on display in a museum,'' he said.
   But the time and distance involved for the mysterious Egyptians
seem to make viewing them less distasteful.
   ``Letting the rest of the world study and enjoy these things only
creates greater appreciation of the Egyptian culture,'' Berk said.

<HEAD>Rose's Handwriting Was On Betting Slips, Expert Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS two grafs to UPDATE with Rose comment. A longer version
moved on sports wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE KAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A handwriting expert examined betting slips
contained in baseball's report on Pete Rose and concluded that his
handwriting is on wager slips involving Cincinnati Reds' games, The
Associated Press learned Wednesday.
   In addition, The New York Times reported in Thursday's editions
that the slips have Rose's fingerprints on them as well as being in
his handwriting.
   ``Rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries,'' a federal law
enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, was quoted by
the Times as saying. ``He says he didn't write them but we're as
confident as we could be that he did.''
   The betting slips may support allegations that Rose, who holds
the major league baseball record for career hits, bet on his own
team. If proven, the offense would mean an automatic lifetime ban
from the game.
   Rose, who has sued Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti in state
court, has maintained he never bet on baseball. His lawyers also
have said that baseball's report on gambling allegations, written by
John M. Dowd, was based on hearsay and the word of convicted
criminals.
   However, a source familiar with baseball's investigation told The
Associated Press that the betting slips _ and the expert's
verification of Rose's handwriting on them _ give baseball tangible
evidence of Rose's betting. The handwriting expert was hired by
baseball as part of its investigation.
   Rose's lawyers sued Giamatti on Monday in attempts to block a
hearing next Monday with the commissioner in New York. Hamilton
County Common Pleas Judge Norbert Nadel will consider Rose's request
for a temporary restraining order during a hearing Thursday.
   The betting slips were revealed as part of Rose's lawsuit against
Giamatti and currently are in the possession of federal authorities
who have investigated Rose on tax matters.
   Rose's lawyers allege that Paul Janszen, who claims to have run
bets for Rose, stole three pieces of paper from the home of the
Reds' manager. The papers are described as the ``Pete Rose Betting
Sheets'' in Dowd's report.
   Baseball officials declined Wednesday to discuss the handwriting
analysis. Rose's lawyers indicated in their court filing that they
wanted an expert of their own to examine the sheets as well.
   Rose's lawsuit attacks the reliability of one of the betting
slips. The lawsuit says the first of the three sheets ``purports to
set forth a bet made on an April 9, 1987 game where Cincinnati
played at Montreal.''
   ``Incredibly, Dowd places significant emphasis on this sheet of
paper even though April 9 was an off-day for the Reds, and while
they played in Montreal the previous day, the game was in Cincinnati
and not in Montreal,'' the suit said.
   Rose's lawyers make no mention of the other two betting slips.
Lawyer Reuven J. Katz declined to answer any questions about the
betting slips or the handwriting analysis.
   Rose, speaking after the Reds lost a doubleheader to the Braves
in Atlanta, was informed of the reports on the handwriting and
fingerprints.
   ``That's not true,'' he said. ``I'm not commenting on anything
like that. Any other baseball questions? I thought it was in the
courts right now. I'll say it again, I'm not going to talk about
it.''

<HEAD>Accumulation of Red Ink Slowing in '89</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's budget deficit is mounting at
a slower pace this year than it did in fiscal 1988, due to stronger
federal income tax collections so far in 1989.
   For the first eight months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began
Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $113.32 billion, 11.8 percent
less than the $128.43 billion shortfall counted at the same time
last year, the Treasury Department reported Wednesday.
   Analysts say the figures suggest this year's shortfall is likely
to undershoot both the Bush administration's projection for a $163.3
billion deficit and the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of
$159 billion.
   For all of last fiscal year, the deficit totaled $155.1 billion.
   The Treasury report showed the government posted a $25.47 billion
budget deficit last month, 12.8 percent more red ink than in May
1988 and higher than most analysts had expected.
   The May shortfall followed a record surplus of $40.57 billion in
April, when government coffers were fattened by an unusually large
surge in income tax payments.
   Last month, revenues were up 19.1 percent from May 1988 to $71.12
billion, while spending was up 17.4 percent from a year earlier to
$96.58 billion.
   Analysts say revenues this year have been running ahead of
projections due to strong personal income tax collections generated
in the wake of the 1986 overhaul of the tax code.
   ``Even though we had slightly wider red ink in May, it does
appear as if the budget for the entire year will show visible
improvement over last year,'' said economist William V. Sullivan of
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Sullivan estimated the fiscal 1989 deficit will total $130
billion to $135 billion, and said most of the improvement comes from
the bulge in personal income tax receipts in April. He said the
surge in tax payments occurred because people shifted some of their
income from 1987 to 1988 when the top tax rate dropped.
   Economist Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities
Inc. in Chicago said that although May's deficit was higher than
expected, ``it looks like the trend in the deficit is working its
way down slowly.''
   Kahan estimated the 1989 deficit would be around $135 billion to
$145 billion.
   As usual, the government's largest spending category last month
was the military. Defense spending in May totaled $24.33 billion and
reached $192.96 billion for the first eight months of the fiscal
year. That was up 2.3 percent from the same point a year earlier.
   Other large spending categories were:
   _Social Security: $19.15 billion in May and $147.53 billion so
far in fiscal 1989, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
   _Other programs in the Department of Health and Human Services:
$15.22 billion in May and $112.34 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up
6.9 percent from a year earlier.
   _Interest payments on the national debt: $20.06 billion in May
and $153.67 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 11.8 percent from a
year earlier.

<HEAD>Tightening of US-China Relations Won't Affect Grain Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. grain market will remain open to China
despite further tightening of relations in the wake of Beijing's
crackdown on pro-democracy forces, says Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   ``I would not see that in any way affecting the present status of
agricultural transactions, either actual or potential,'' Yeutter
told reporters on Wednesday.
   Earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United
States deeply regretted China's execution of three protesters but
added that no additional U.S. action is being contemplated.
   Baker said President Bush believes the sanctions already in place
are the proper response to the bloody crackdown by the Beijing
regime and the arrests of more than 1,600 demonstrators.
   Asked about Bush's order curtailing contacts by U.S. officials
with their Chinese counterparts and suspending all high-level
official visits to China, Yeutter said he didn't think that would
have much effect on the agricultural trade situation.
   ``Not in terms of commercial transactions between the two
countries,'' Yeutter said. ``It certainly could have some effect on
the conduct of government-to-government programs, of course,
including such issues as potential Chinese membership in the GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).''
   But while the commercial sales of U.S. grain to China are
expected to be unaffected by Bush's orders, Yeutter said programs
for extending further credit or subsidized sales of wheat to Beijing
are another matter.
   ``There is nothing in the president's statements to date, nor
will there be in the future, that will affect the fundamental
openness of the American marketplace,'' Yeutter said.
   However, when speaking about credit or the subsidy provisions of
the Export Enhancement Program for China, ``that's a separate
question'' and will be addressed as the situation requires, he said.
   China is expected to buy about $1.4 billion worth of U.S. farm
commodities in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, compared with
$613 million in 1987-88, according to Agriculture Department
estimates. That would compare with $7.9 billion forecast for Japan's
purchases, traditionally the largest, and $3.4 billion for the
Soviet Union.

   Farmers continue to be the major buyers of
agricultural land, according to a preliminary report by the
Agriculture Department.
   Farm owners and operators were involved in 57 percent of all
farmland purchases in the year that ended on Feb. 1, the report
said. Non-farmers participated in 29 percent of the sales. No
further breakdown was provided, however.
   About 87 percent of the farmland sold was expected to remain in
agricultural use at least five years after purchase, 2 percent in
forestry, and 11 percent in other uses.
   ``About two-thirds of the sales involved credit financing, down
substantially from 90 percent in the early 1980s when farmland
prices were their highest,'' the report said Wednesday.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service said
farmland values through 1989 and early 1990 ``are expected to
continue increasing at an average rate slightly above this past
year's 6 percent.''
   Higher farm income, lower inflation-adjusted interest rates on
real estate loans, and moderate growth in inflation were cited as
reasons for the forecast. One report last month predicated that
farmland values could rise an average of 7 percent to 9 percent in
1989, compared with the 6 percent gain last year.

   Anderson, a native of Iona, Minn., and an agricultural economics
graduate of South Dakota State University, has more than 25 years
representing U.S. agricultural interests overseas, Yeutter said
Wednesday.
   ``His distinguished service qualifies him uniquely to lead FAS
during this important period of negotiation for reform in world
agricultural trade,'' Yeutter said.
   Anderson past assignments at U.S. embassies in Britain, the

<HEAD>Study Touts Half Trillion Dollar Impact For Civil Aviation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil aviation and related businesses pump more
than half a trillion dollars a year into the nation's economy,
according to an aviation industry study.
   The study, released Wednesday by the Partnership for Improved Air
Travel, says the industry contributed $522 billion to the economy in
1987, the latest year for which complete data is available.
   Since then, rapid growth has continued, with a doubling of orders
for civilian aircraft, partnership officials said at a news
conference.
   The study is part of the group's effort to convince Congress and
local governments of the need for more airports and other facilities
to serve the growing aviation industry. Air travel has doubled since
the industry was deregulated in 1978.
   The partnership was formed last year by airlines, airplane
manufacturers, unions, local government representatives and others
interested in expanding the air transportation system.
   The figures in the study add up everything from the manufacture
of airliners to money paid for haircuts at barbershops near
airports, partnership officials said. They included transactions
made possible by the existence of aviation, such as purchases made
at destinations by vacationers and other travelers.
   Officials acknowledged, however, the study does not factor in
some of the negative impact of aviation, such as the cost of noise
pollution abatement at busy airports or losses from accidents.
   The report, compiled by Wilbur Smith Associates of Columbia,
S.C., says aviation and associated businesses employ 8 million
people, or 7.3 percent of the nation's workforce, with a $155
billion payroll.
   The industry's contribution to the gross national product was
estimated at $254 billion in 1987, or 5.6 percent of the total GNP.
This figure does not count the haircuts and other indirect impacts
of aviation the industry claims.
   Herbert D. Kelleher, partnership president, said the United
States has the safest and most efficient aviation system in the
world but more construction is needed to accommodate rapidly
increasing air travel.
   ``The problem is that while we are building twice as many planes
to accommodate twice as many passengers,'' Kelleher said, ``we are
failing to build the aviation infrastructure rapidly enough to keep
planes and people moving efficiently.''
   He said the study is the first to cover all of the country's
16,949 civil airports, as well as airplane manufacturers, suppliers,
trade associations, travel agents, retail business and air cargo.
   The study includes a state-by-state analysis of the impact of the
industry. But the conclusions for each state are identical:
``Expansion of (the state's) aviation industry and air
transportation system is vital to the economic health and
international competitiveness of the state.''
   Aviation-related expenditures for each state are in nearly direct
proportion to the state's population.

   The Associated Press reported erroneously
Wednesday that the three men executed in Shanghai were shot in front
of a crowd.
   An official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office told the AP on
Wednesday that a ``propaganda meeting'' was called and the death
sentences were carried out Wednesday. The government office said it
did not have details of the meeting and execution.
   Due to an imprecise translation by the AP, it was erroneously
reported that the executions were carried out at the meeting.
   The Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office today said the executions
were not carried out at the meeting, and the three men were taken
away to an execution ground and shot.

   New York lawmakers have endorsed the notion
that while men and women may have been created equal, one definitely
takes longer in the bathroom.
   The state Assembly gave final approval Wednesday to a ``potty
parity'' bill that would require new buildings to have as many
toilets for women as for men.
   ``It's been suggested that if we can't find equity here, can we
find it anyplace?'' asked Assemblywoman Helen Marshall, the bill's
sponsor.
   The bill, dubbed a ``squatters' bill of rights'' and a
``back-stall method to enact an equal rights amendment,'' was
approved 140-1.
   The dissenter, Assemblyman Kemp Hannon, the No. 2 man in the
Assembly's Republican minority, said women should have more toilets
than men because they need more time in the bathroom.
   He cited a Cornell University undergraduate study that called for
women to have six toilets for every four that men have, including
urinals.
   Marshall drew laughs when she noted that the same Cornell study
found that ``a man's biological needs are cared for within 45
seconds, as compared to a woman, who takes 79 seconds.''
   Nonetheless, Marshall said the law would be a firm step toward
equity. The bill has already passed the state Senate. There was no
indication from Gov. Mario Cuomo whether he'll sign the bill into
law.

   China executed three men Wednesday and up to 17
others were condemned to die for their roles in student-led protests
that challenged the power of the Communist Party.
   The executions in Shanghai were carried out despite appeals for
clemency by President Bush and other Western leaders.
   Premier Li Peng denounced the foreign criticism.
   He told visiting Foreign Secretary Humayun Khan of Pakistan that
most of the millions of Chinese who took part nationwide in marches,
sit-ins and hunger strikes for a freer society would be treated
leniently ``even if they had extremist opinions.''
   But Li said, ``The tiny minority of criminals will be punished
according to the law.''
   The meeting was the first top-level contact with a foreign
delegation since the crackdown began June 3-4, when the army fired
on students and supporters in Beijing to end their pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   More than 1,600 arrests have been reported nationwide since, and
the nation's highest court has urged lower courts to deal swiftly
and severely with protest-related cases.
   So far, 28 people have been condemned to death: the three who
were executed, the 17 who were sentenced on Wednesday, and eight
others who were previously sentenced to death.
   The Shanghai men were convicted of setting a train on fire on
June 6 after it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters,
killing six people.
   They were shot to death Wednesday after Shanghai's highest court
rejected their appeals, a spokesman at the city's Foreign Affairs
Office said. He said he did not know other details and refused to
give his name.
   The national television news reported the executions, which an
official at the city's Foreign Affairs office on Thursday said were
carried out at an execution ground. Due to an error in translation,
an official at the office was understood Wednesday to have said the
three were executed before a crowd.
   The men were Xu Guoming, a brewery worker; Yan Xuerong, a radio
factory worker; and Bian Hanwu, who was unemployed.
   Beijing radio said 45 people who ``seriously endangered public
order'' were tried in front of an audience of 10,000 people in Jinan
in eastern China's Shandong province.
   It did not give details of their alleged crimes, but said some
were given the death penalty. Others were given death sentences
suspended for two years with the possibility of being commuted to
life in prison, the radio reported.
   An editor at the state-run Jinan Daily said 17 of the 45 were
given death sentences, but said he did not know if the figure
included those given two-year reprieves.
   The public trial in Jinan and executions in Shanghai underscored
China's emphasis on using the death penalty as a deterrent.
   China does not release figures on executions and not all are
reported in the official media. By Western count, more than 10,000
people were executed in a period of several years after an
anti-crime drive began in 1983.
   Death sentences usually are carried out by a bullet to the back
of the head. They are sometimes commuted to life in prison but there
is no record of a sentence being overturned on appeal in Communist
China.
   Li defended China's actions as necessary to put down a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   ``When China is in difficulties for the time being it sees
clearly who are true friends and who are false ones,'' the
television news quoted him as saying.
   The government did not immediately respond to Bush's suspension
of high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts and moves to block $1.4 billion
in development loans to protest the crackdown. France and the
Netherlans already had frozen relations and Japan has suspended new
development loans.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the
Bush administration deeply regrets the executions but was not
considering additional sanctions.
   ``There is an important relationship which we should seek to
preserve if we possibly can,'' he said.
   China's State Education Commission ordered local governments to
arrange ``political ideological education'' for college students,
especially those graduating this year.
   Its order, published in the party newspaper, the People's Daily,
said the main ``weapon'' in such classes should be a June 9 speech
by senior leader Deng Xiaoping that said the students has been used
by anti-party plotters.
   Deng said the greatest mistake of his 10 years in power was a
failure to educate students and the public.
   Local radio in the southeastern city of Canton said some students
there still were organizing illegal activities and were ordered to
stop and confess to police. No details of their activities were
given.
   Officials at the Beijing airport said they arrested four people
described as fugitives linked to the protests. Officials in Hebei
province just south of Beijing said they had arrested 44 fugitives,
including two Beijing two student activists.
   Shanghai officials said 65 people surrendered there, including 42
student and citizen activists. They said some, after ``seeing the
light,'' informed on others.
   Canadian Charge D'Affairs Daniel Dhavernas protested to the
Foreign Ministry over an apparent attempt by plainclothes police to
seize Canadian reporter Jan Wong.
   Ms. Wong, of the Toronto Globe and Mail, said three men who did
not identify themselves on Monday tried to push her into an unmarked
car but gave up when she resisted and a crowd gathered. She called
the attack police harassment.
   China has banned most foreign reporting activities in Beijing and
expelled six foreign reporters in the past two weeks for allegedly
violating the rules.

<HEAD>Experts Decry Scare Over Pesticides, Point to Benefits</HEAD>

   Americans stand a greater health risk from
eliminating fruits and vegetables from their diets than they do from
pesticide residue on the produce, food researchers told a House
Agriculture subcommittee.
   ``The real issue is the risk of pesticide use as compared to
other risks in the food environment,'' Sanford Miller, dean of the
school of biomedical sciences at the University of Texas Science
Center, said Wednesday.
   He said food experts agree the risks of exposure to the low level
of pesticides found on food are significantly less than those
associated with the pests they kill.
   Moreover, he said, ``there is the question of the risk of
reducing fruit and vegetable consumption in response to these
concerns (about pesticides).''
   Miller was among 10 witnesses called before the subcommittee on
domestic marketing, consumer relations and nutrition. Subcommittee
members said they wanted to reduce public fears about chemical
residue on food.
   ``As a result of the Alar and Chilean grape stories of early
spring, consumers lost their trust in the safety of fresh fruits and
vegetables generally,'' said Rep. Charles Hatcher, D-Ga.,
subcommittee chairman.
   ``Ninety-nine point nine percent of the food we have gets
blacklisted because of the 0.1 percent that is bad,'' Agriculture
Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, complained.
   Hatcher said it was ironic that consumers have cut back on fresh
fruit and vegetable consumption even as the National Research
Council of the National Academy of Sciences has recommended people
should eat more plant foods.
   Dr. Sushma Palmer, of the academy, said a study issued in March
recommends that people eat five or more one-half cup servings of a
combination of vegetables and fruits every day, especially green and
yellow vegetables and citrus fruits.
   She said extensive studies around the world have shown that
people who regularly eat a lot of plant foods have low risk of
hardening of the arteries of the heart, which is the leading cause
of death in the United States.
   ``The reason for this finding is not fully known, although the
low-fat content of these foods is clearly beneficial,'' said Palmer.
   Palmer said there is not much information on whether eating foods
that have been sprayed with pesticides cause disease, but ``limited
data in humans thus far suggest that no adverse effects result from
the ingestion of small amounts of these agents in foods.''
   ``Furthermore, our committee determined that the potential small
increased risk of these somewhat uncommon tumors that might result
from increased exposures to pesticides in the general population
would be greatly outweighed by the potential benefits to be expected
from greater fruit and vegetable consumption,'' she said.
   Another House subcommittee and one in the Senate are gathering
testimony on legislation that has been introduced to strengthen the
standards the Environmental Protection Agency uses to determine what
chemicals could be used in pesticides.
   Stephen Wood, of the New England Fruit Growers' Council on the
Environment, called the reaction to Alar on apples that led the
manufacturer to remove it from the market ``absurdly inflated
national panic'' that he did not want to see duplicated in
legislation.
   He said growers need to have a range of pesticides to choose from
as they move away from chemicals.
   ``The sort of trial by media and marketplace that we have just
observed is devastating to the effort to achieve environmentally
sound methods of production,'' Wood said. ``If this trend continues,
growers will begin to choose chemicals according to vague
anticipation to the public will.''

   The House Ways and Means Committee, turning
thumbs-down on the first proposed tax increase of the year, is using
a deficit-reduction bill to increase spending for social programs.
   The package includes higher spending for welfare and children's
services and authority for Social Security recipients to earn $360
more next year and $240 more in 1991 before losing a portion of
their benefits.
   In a second day of work on a catchall package Wednesday, the
committee rejected a recommendation from its human-resources
subcommittee and defeated a proposed increase in the employers' tax
that finances unemployment compensation. The vote in a closed-door
session was 18-17 against the increase, with Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the committee, voting on the losing side.
   The Bush administration had expressed solid opposition to the tax
increase, which would have cost employers $10.6 billion over five
years at the federal level and automatically boosted their state
taxes as well.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., acting chairman of the subcommittee that
proposed the increase, said he will not give up the fight for the
boost and an attached improvement in jobless benefits. He told
reporters the committee was simply signaling opposition to any kind
of tax increase at this point in the budget negotiations.
   The committee voted to raise by a total of $600 over two years
the annual amount Social Security recipients may earn without losing
part of their benefits. The new limits: $9,720 in 1990 and $10,440
the following year.
   For each $3 earned above those levels, the beneficiary would lose
$1 of Social Security.
   The bill does not affect the lower earnings limit that applies to
retirees 62, 63 or 64. That ceiling will rise under current law from
$6,480 this year to $6,840 next year.
   Persons 70 and older also would be unaffected; they could
continue to earn an unlimited amount without losing any pension
benefit.
   The committee also agreed to raise a special Social Security
minimum benefit for retirees who worked long years at low wages. The
net effect would be to increase to about $5,676 the special $5,256
minimum benefit for a person who worked 30 years and retired at age
65.
   While the minimum-benefit increase would help only the poorest
recipients of Social Security, the boost in the earnings limit would
help those at the other end of the income scale.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in 1986 only 10
percent of the people between 65 and 69 and eligible for Social
Security gave up a part of their pension because of the earnings
limit. More than 40 percent had total income over $42,000.
   Under present law, a person age 65 through 69 may earn up to
$8,880 and still draw a full Social Security benefit. For each $2
earned above that level, the worker must give up $1 in benefits;
starting next year the giveback is only $1 for every $3 earned above
the maximum.
   Other parts of the package approved Wednesday would increase
slightly benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program for
poor and disabled individuals; boost grants to the states for such
social services as Meals on Wheels, and raise spending for foster
care.
   The legislation would strip the Social Security Administration
from the Department of Health and Human Services. The new
independent agency would be governed by a three-member board
appointed by the president; an executive director named by the board
would oversee day-to-day operations.

<HEAD>Vets' Programs Threatened as Emergency Bill Locked in Limbo</HEAD>

   An emergency spending bill Congress has been
debating since April has run into new trouble that threatens to
cause cuts in some veterans' programs as lawmakers prepare to leave
for their Fourth of July holiday.
   The House, in a surprise 218-201 vote, sent the bill back to
committee Wednesday. House leaders immediately asked the Senate to
hold new talks in search of a compromise acceptable to President
Bush and Democrats.
   With warnings of service cuts at veterans' hospitals and with the
Senate scheduled to begin a two-week recess on Friday, there was
increasing pressure on Congress to complete the task and leaders
searched for another way to keep veterans programs running while
other subjects continued in dispute.
   The key dispute is over an $821 million drug law enforcement
amendment which House Democrats were trying to push past the Senate
and President Bush, who has threatened a veto.
   By beating the $3.5 billion emergency spending bill in an early
procedural vote, Republicans were able to avoid voting on the
anti-drug spending, which is opposed by the president as wasteful
despite its political popularity.
   All but five Republicans voted against the bill and 52 Democrats
joined the GOP lawmakers, partly because of a Republican memo
highlighting pork barrel spending in the measure.
   The tally was a surprise defeat for the newly installed
Democratic leadership. Speaker Thomas S. Foley had confidently
predicted they would prevail.
   ``There are going to be times when the unexpected occurs. We will
have our ups and downs,'' said House Majority Whip William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., who said leaders had not pressured Democrats to keep in
line.
   The bill, under congressional budget rules, is supposed to
provide money only for ``dire emergencies'' which the government
must attend to before Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.
   There is no disagreement over the largest single item, $1.2
billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover a shortfall
in money for medical care, compensation and pensions, and in other
areas.
   Congressional leaders Wednesday night began exploring a
short-term bill for only veterans' programs to prevent major
disruptions, according to Democratic and Republican aides who spoke
on condition they not be identified.
   Final details were still being worked out, but such a bill would
carry the Veterans programs through July 22, giving Congress extra
time to iron out the drug and other disputes, the aides said.
   Nearly $900 million would be added to the federal guaranteed
student loan program, $342 million to cover the cost of fighting
last year's widespread forest fires, and $423 million for foster
care and adoption.
   The food stamp program would be increased $225 million, aid to
the unemployed $90 million, and refugee assistance 100 million.
   However, influential lawmakers also used the must-pass
legislation as a vehicle for cherished spending projects for their
constituents. For example, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., included $75 million to rebuild a
radiotelescope in his state.
   The White House said Wednesday that Bush would sign the bill,
even with most of those constituent projects, if the drug money were
left out and some budget gimmicks which threatened future excess
spending were deleted.
   The gimmicks included moving the dates on paychecks for some
federal workers up one day, so the money would count against this
fiscal year instead of fiscal 1990. Another accounting change would
allow Congress to dodge agreed-upon spending limits for housing and
related agencies.

   Soldiers armed with blowtorches cut
up the gun barrels of battle tanks while other troops ripped the
frames apart to demonstrate how serious this country is about
disarmament.
   ``This is not an empty show put on for the world's benefit,''
Col. Joachim Nicolaus said Wednesday during a tour for Western
journalists. ``We are holding true to the intention to destroy these
weapons, and you are witnesses to the fulfillment of this pledge.''
   Officials showed reporters some of the 600 medium-sized tanks the
government says it plans to dismantle as part of a unilateral
decision to trim its conventional arsenal.
   East Germany in January announced it was reducing its armed
forces by 600 tanks, 10,000 troops and 50 combat aircraft. It plans
to complete the cuts by next year. According to East German figures,
the country's armed forces have 3,140 battle tanks.
   Nicolaus, commander of the two bases along East Germany's
southeastern border with Poland, said more than 130 tanks had been
brought to the site to be scrapped or converted for civilian use.
   About 150 of the 36-ton tanks will be modified for use in heavy
industry, mainly in the nation's coal mining operations, said Col.
Helmut Erdmann, a military spokesman. He said the remaining 450
Soviet-type T-55A tanks will be destroyed.
   Some spare parts and sophisticated equipment will be salvaged, he
said.
   Reporters saw more than 11 tanks in various stages of demolition
at the first base near Charlottenhof.
   Huge cranes lifted the tanks' six-ton turrets from their armored
frames, dumping them in neat rows where soldiers stripped them of
their inch-thick, anti-radiation interior coating.
   Other soldiers removed machine guns while their comrades used
acetylene torches to cut 15-foot-long, 100mm gun barrels into small
pieces.
   At the second installation near the town of Ostritz, soldiers
were busy in workshops melting down machine guns and breaking up the
thickly armored tank bodies into small chunks. The Ostritz facility
finishes the job begun near Charlottenhof.
   Piles of metal and other tank parts were scattered across both
compounds. Near a jumble of former gun carriages, a sign read:
``Cannon Junk.''
   Erdmann said most of the tanks were five to 15 years old.
   ``We're not just throwing out ancient clunkers,'' he said.
``These tanks still have a lot of mileage left in them.''
   Olaf Windisch, a 19-year-old soldier from the industrial city of
Leipzig, said he had mixed emotions about the demolition.
   ``You put a lot of work in keeping these tanks in combat shape
and you develop an affection for them, the same as people get
attached to cars,'' said Windisch, wiping perspiration from his brow
after removing armor plating from the inside of a gun turret.
   ``But I grew up in a time of peace and I don't want to see war.
I'm glad we're getting rid of some weapons.''
   Commandant Nicolaus said he had seen some difficult moments among
crews selected to consign their tanks to the junk pile.
   ``I've seen tank commanders stroke the sides of their machines
with tears in their eyes,'' he said. ``That was their tank and they
didn't want to part with it.''

<HEAD>Vargas Llosa Says He's Bowing Out of Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrated novelist Mario Vargas Llosa says he
is bowing out of the presidential race in this troubled Andean
nation, blaming political wrangling within the center-right
coalition that has been backing him.
   Vargas Llosa, the front-runner for March 1990 elections and among
Latin America's leading writers, made his decision known in a letter
to leaders of the two principal parties that comprise his Democratic
Front coalition.
   Also Wednesday, the government for the first time appealed for
foreign help to fight Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, whose latest
ambush the military said left 15 soldiers and 20 rebels dead in a
cocaine-producing jungle region.
   Vargas Llosa, 53, criticized the ``mediocre and petty'' motives
of some within his coalition to raise their own interests above
those of the nation.
   In his letter, read during a television broadcast, Vargas Llosa
said he was withdrawing because of the rivalry between former
President Fernando Belaunde Terry of the Popular Action Party and
former Lima Mayor Luis Bedoya of the Popular Christian Party.
   Belaunde and Bedoya had been unable to agree on how to proceed in
November municipal elections. Each party wanted to field its own
candidates, but Vargas Llosa argued that would divide the coalition.
   This ``has obliged me to renounce my candidacy for the president
of the republic,'' Vargas Llosa said.
   ``The collapse of the Front could open the door in our country to
totalitarian Marxism or a bloody military adventure,'' Vargas Llosa
wrote.
   Miguel Cruchaga, secretary general of the Liberty Movement, one
group in the coalition, said the decision appeared to be
``irrevocable,'' but added, ``We are going to mobilize public
opinion so that Vargas Llosa is a candidate.''
   Another leader of the Liberty Movement, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that Vargas Llosa's resignation
appeared to be aimed at achieving undisputed leadership of the Front.
   Vargas Llosa, who once described himself as a ``specialist in
fantasies, in dreams,'' began his candidacy just 18 days ago in the
southern city of Arequipa, his birthplace.
   He was catapulted into the political arena after organizing a
huge rally against populist President Alan Garcia's plan to
nationalize the banks.
   Garcia's 4-year-old government is beset by an economic crisis,
triple-digit annual inflation and the Shining Path insurgency, now
in its ninth year and plaguing much of Peru.
   Garcia is prohibited by law from running for re-election and his
party's presidential candidate, former Finance Minister Luis Alva
Castro, is given little chance of winning because of voter
discontent with Garcia.
   Nearly 15,000 people have been killed in the conflict with
Shining Path, including rebels, police, soldiers, public officials
and highland peasants.
   In addition to the soldiers slain in the jungle, Shining Path
guerrillas this week assassinated the mayor of a northeastern
tourist town and killed five ex-soldiers traveling on a bus in the
Andean highlands, authorities said.
   The mayor, a member of Garcia's Aprista party, was the 46th
killed in the last two years by guerrillas.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen babies have died of
dehydration since the beginning of May in a hospital that can't
afford air conditioning in its pediatric ward.
   Little relief is in sight from a heat wave that began last week
and has sent many looking for medical help. Patients at Juarez
General Hospital sometimes find conditions inside almost as
unbearable as outside.
   On Wednesday, more than a dozen infants being treated for
dehydration endured the heat of the non-air conditioned, two-room
pediatric ward as the temperature outside climbed to 105 degrees.
   ``It's unforgivable to have our children without air
conditioning,'' hospital director Victor Manuel Jurado said as he
wiped sweat off the forehead of a baby. ``Many times, they get worse
when they get here.''
   Jurado said the staff Juarez General, where the 14 infants have
died, remains committed, but can do little about the heat because
the hospital simply can't afford air conditioning.
   People have been reporting heat-related medical problems all over
the sunbaked city. Red Cross officials said they are treating about
24 cases of dehydration a day and the Social Security Hospital
reported it has admitted 137 patients suffering from heat-related
illnesses since the beginning of May.
   Most cases of infant dehydration are coupled with severe
diarrhea, a leading cause of infant death in the Third World.
   Temperatures have topped 100 degrees daily since late last week,
and a high of 100 was expected today. Because the desert skies
remain cloudless and humidity drops to the single digits or teens
during daytime, there is nothing in the air to diffuse the sun's
oppressive rays.
   Jurado said parents often make the mistake of waiting too long to
take their children to the hospital.
   ``People wait until the child is agonizing before bringing him
here,'' the doctor said. ``They come to us in serious condition, and
many times there is little we can do.''
   Officials in El Paso and Juarez are urging people to remain
indoors from noon to 5 p.m. and drink lots of nonalcoholic beverages.

<HEAD>Pentagon Officials Stresses Survivability of Long-Range Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon official, boosting President Bush's
plan to build both the Midgetman and MX missiles, told Congress some
of the land-based nuclear missiles deployed by the United States
must be able to survive a sudden nuclear attack.
   The statement by Paul Wolfowitz, the undersecretary of defense
for policy, was hailed Wednesday as a step forward by congressional
leaders who have criticized the president for failing to make a
stronger case for his two-missile plan.
   ``Our land-based missile deterrent program is now being designed
with the president's proposal to basically have a deterrence against
both a `bolt-out-of-the-blue' attack as well as a first strike,''
said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   In arguing for the two-missile plan, Wolfowitz said survivability
is a consideration in all parts of the so-called nuclear triad: the
combination of land-, air- and sea-based nuclear weapons.
   ``If some of our ICBMs were survivable, this would provide, among
other things, a hedge should vulnerabilities emerge in the bomber or
submarine legs, and in conjunction with the alert bombers and at-sea
SSBNs, the strongest possible deterrent against Soviet pre-emptive
strike,'' Wolfowitz told the Senate panel.
   He acknowledged deterrence has been the center of the debate over
modernization of land-based missiles for almost two decades. The
administration concluded after a recent review that some of each
portion of the triad must be survivable as part of that deterrent.
   The nation's bombers and submarines meet that goal and the
emphasis is now on land-based missiles, he said.
   The Bush administration is looking to protect land-based missiles
in silos against a Soviet strike during a crisis or even a
conventional war and from a sudden attack in the absence of any
hostilities. Other missiles would be mobile.
   Wolfowitz also told the panel verification and funds for the two
missiles are necessary before the United States can reach a treaty
agreement with the Soviet Union to limit mobile missiles.
   Bush told congressional leaders Tuesday he was willing to abandon
the mobile-missile ban at the negotiating table in Geneva if it
would strengthen his chance of winning congressional approval for
his two-missile plan.
   Bush in April proposed spending $1.2 billion in fiscal 1990 on
moving the existing multiple-warhead MX missiles from silos to
railroad cars and another $100 million on the single-warhead
Midgetman.
   Bush's decision Tuesday received a favorable response from
members of Congress, as did his decision to increase funds for the
Midgetman by about $1 billion.
   While Bush has tempered the opposition to the two-missile plan,
complaints about the B-2 stealth program are growing in Congress. At
about $500 million a copy, the radar-evading is the most expensive
in history.
   Nunn raised the issue with Gen. Larry Welch, Air Force chief of
staff, saying the problems with the earlier B-1, budget constraints
and concerns about ``not flying before we buy'' have contributed to
the opposition.
   Welch argued that if the Pentagon attempted flight tests of three
or four planes while shutting down production, the cost of the
aircraft would increase significantly.
   ``Delaying production would cost $3 billion for one year,'' Welch
said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has already proposed pushing back
production of the stealth bomber a year to 1993 and cutting almost
$4.1 billion from fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the plane.

<HEAD>Home Mortgage Program Losing Money, Adding to Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials say millions of dollars in
losses in the government's largest program for insuring home
mortgages are probably a ``temporary aberration'' that will improve
as the housing market shores up.
   The Federal Housing Administration, which insures $247 billion
worth of mortgages under its program for single-family homes, lost
$369 million in fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, and $149.5
million in the first six months of fiscal 1989, ended March 31,
according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the
FHA's parent agency.
   The net worth of the fund for the FHA's most popular insurance
program, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, fell from $3.4 billion
at the end of fiscal 1987 to about $2.8 billion at the end of 1988
and has declined below $2.7 billion so far in 1989, according to a
HUD financial officer who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
   The HUD official termed the losses a ``serious situation,'' but
said the fund was not in danger of exhausting its net worth, which
would require Congress to step in and rescue the self-supporting
program.
   ``There's nothing we see at this stage that would put us in that
position short of an absolutely severe regional downturn for a
sustained five-to-six-year period,'' the official said.
   Mortgage defaults, particularly in southwestern states suffering
from a depressed oil industry, have largely helped fuel the losses,
according to government officials.
   The official predicted continuing, although diminishing, losses
the rest of this year and in 1990, with profitability returning in
1991.
   Dennis J. Duquette of the General Accounting Office, Congress'
auditing wing, said GAO has examined the situation and ``I'm not so
sure the public needs to be overly concerned. We think it's probably
a temporary aberration.''
   He said FHA holdings are well diversified with mortgages from all
regions of the United States, both ailing and healthy.
   ``What we have here is not a savings and loan crisis,'' he said.
   A report in The New York Times, which quoted FHA officials as
saying the agency had only enough money to cover five months of
claims, is incorrect, said William Glavin, a HUD spokesman.
   However, Duquette said the losses are a matter of concern for
federal budget writers even if they do not threaten the mortgage
program's net worth.
   When the FHA has a cash outflow _ because it pays out more for
insurance claims than it collects in fees _ that adds to the budget
deficit. Conversely, when housing markets are hot and the FHA is
underwriting a lot of mortgages, its fee income jumps and it
actually helps to reduce the budget deficit. That happened in 1987
when the FHA had a profit of $101 million, according to the HUD
official.
   The GAO, which tracks FHA finances on a somewhat different
accounting basis from what the agency uses, showed a cash outflow of
$452 million in fiscal 1988, according to a report it issued last
month. The agency plans to issue a complete FHA audit for 1988 in
about a month, Duquette said.
   The GAO attributes the recent outflows to the cyclical nature of
the FHA's business, said Duquette.
   The residential housing market peaked nationally in 1986 and 1987
and so did insurance premium income. Unlike private mortgage
insurors, the FHA collects all of its premium up front in a single
fee, rather than collecting it monthly over the early years of a
mortgage.
   Also, defaults generally peak two to three years after a mortgage
is written so the FHA is just now experiencing the after effects of
its 1986-87 bulge in business, which fell by 50 percent between 1987
and 1988. Defaults, according to budget documents, are expected to
leap from $2.9 billion in 1986 to $6.6 billion this year.

   The dollar continued its slide against the Japanese
yen on Thursday while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
inched down.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 141.40 yen, down 3.55 yen
from Wednesday's 144.95-yen finish. The currency opened at 141.75
yen and fell further while fluctuating between 140.35 yen and 141.75
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 111.81 points
Wednesday, lost 20.31 points, or 0.06 percent, finishing at
33,324.97. The index, which moved higher during the morning session,
suffered a setback in the afternoon.
   Dealers said the index fell as profit-takers sold issues, while
others stepped off to the sidelines in the absence of
market-affecting incentives.
   A trader said the market, which suffered consecutive losses last
week, has not fully recovered its strength.
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's decline followed
sharp overnight retreats on overseas markets.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said the
majority of investors have lost confidence in the U.S. unit after
recent market movements.
   ``Some trust investment companies and foreign investors bought
the dollar when it approached 140.25 yen, but many participants sold
it to reduce the amount of the currency at hand,'' she said.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the market sold the dollar to avoid losing
profits, while watching how far the currency can fall to determine
the market direction.
   ``Nothing has changed in the U.S. economy, so the dollar would
eventually return to its previous level, somewhere around 130 yen,''
she said, ``The market thinks this is what the central bank also
intends.''
   Kyodo News Service quoted a central bank official as saying it is
``desirable'' for the yen to be a bit higher against the dollar to
forestall inflation.
   Attributing the yen's surge to dollar-selling by speculative
investors in the Middle East, Chicago and Asia, the official said
the yen's further rise will help correct the trade imbalance between
Japan and the United States.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the market Thursday to
sell the U.S. currency to keep it lower against the yen. Neither the
action nor the amount were confirmed because the central bank does
not comment on its monetary activities.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Has Become Monopoly, Senator, Others Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few major cable television operators are now
the ``godfathers'' of the industry, exacting tribute from start-up
companies and withholding programming from rural viewers, a Senate
panel was told.
   An increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and
stiff-armed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need
programming, while growing into a ``cable Cosa Nostra'' that can do
as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition, Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., said Wednesday.
   Since 1986, when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in
place, only about six new cable program networks have been
successful, and they all are at least partially owned by major cable
system operators, Gore said at a Senate communications subcommittee
hearing on ownership of the cable TV industry.
   In the wake of deregulation, ``We have witnessed an extraordinary
concentration of control and integration by cable operators and
program services, manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive
behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable
operators for the right to distribute services,'' Gore said.

   The FBI is making violent crime a nationwide
investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such
offenses in the 1980s, Director William S. Sessions says.
   Sessions told reporters that violent crime will rank with foreign
counterintelligence, terrorism, drugs, organized crime and white
collar crime as major priorities of the FBI.
   ``With the acknowledged 40 percent increase in violent crime, the
American public is understandably outraged by the growing disregard
for human life by criminals,'' Sessions said.
   While state and local police still have jurisdiction to
investigate the vast majority of violent crimes, Sessions said the
FBI can expand its role in this area.
   President Bush has asked Congress to appropriate $19.5 million to
hire 300 new FBI agents as part of his anti-crime package. If
approved, ``we expect to apply those resources directly to the
violent crime problem,'' Sessions said.

   H. Robert Heller, citing financial hardships in
living on his $82,500-a-year government salary, has announced his
resignation as one of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board.
   An expert in international economics, Heller said Wednesday he
would return to California to become an executive vice president of
Visa International, the giant credit card company.
   In a meeting with reporters, he refused to disclose his exact
salary at Visa, saying only that it would be a ``pretty sizable''
increase that would represent a multiple of his government pay.
   Heller specifically cited Congress' rejection earlier this year
of a proposed federal pay raise as one factor in his decision to
leave. Under the proposal, which would have boosted congressional
salaries as well as those of top officials, the pay of a Federal
Reserve governor would have risen to $125,000.
   His resignation will give President Bush his first opportunity to
appoint someone to the Federal Reserve Board. The other six members,
including Chairman Alan Greenspan, were appointed by former
President Reagan.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old girl whose mother went to jail to
keep her hidden after the child alleged she was sexually abused by
her father has been placed in her father's custody.
   Under the judge's ruling Wednesday, Virginia and Stephen LaLonde
will share joint physical custody of the child effective July 9. The
girl will be with her father four days a week and with her mother
the rest of the week.
   Lalonde was given sole legal custody.
   Beth Herr, Ms. LaLonde's attorney, said an appeal was planned,
adding: ``It's certainly a unique decision for a case of this
nature.''
   The couple's fight over custody of their daughter, Nicole, went
to trial in May 1988 before Suffolk County Probate Judge Mary
Fitzpatrick in Boston.
   A central issue was whether Nicole was abused by her father.
Virginia LaLonde and Nicole claimed the child had been abused by
him. LaLonde has denied sexually abusing his daughter.
   The judge ruled Wednesday no sign of sexual abuse existed as
Nicole has claimed.
   The ruling gives Stephen LaLonde sole legal custody to determine
such matters as where Nicole attends school and her day-to-day care.
Nicole asked to see both parents regularly and a schedule of visits
has been worked out.
   ``The idea is to give Nicole as much access as possible,'' said
Peter DiGangi, LaLonde's lawyer.
   His client, he said, ``is elated.''
   Ms. LaLonde must report to a probation officer every day that
Nicole is in her care. The judge also ordered that Nicole continue
sessions with a therapist treating her for more than a year.
   Ms. Herr said an appeal would be based on claims the ruling is
``against the weight of the evidence of the case.''
   DiGangi said an appeal would be unfortunate.
   ``We're sorry that Virginia wishes to continue on the
litigation,'' he said. ``It's time for Nicole to enjoy her
childhood, while she has it.''
   The case drew national attention in 1987 when Ms. LaLonde spent
six months in the Framingham state prison for women rather than
disclose her daughter's whereabouts.
   The wrangling over Nicole began three years after the LaLondes'
1983 divorce when Ms. LaLonde accused her ex-husband of abusing
their child during visits. A probate judge investigated the matter
then and decided the allegations were baseless.
   Rather than allow LaLonde to have custody of his child in June
1986, the mother and child fled the state. They settled in Florida.
But in March 1987, Ms. LaLonde returned alone to Massachusetts to
settle the custody matter.
   When Ms. LaLonde refused to say where Nicole was, a judge held
her in contempt of court and ordered her imprisoned until she would
disclose the child's location.
   The woman was freed only after a baby sitter in Durham, N.C.,
tipped off police that the child was being sheltered by an
underground network of women.
   In October 1987, Nicole was returned to Massachusetts and placed
in the custody of the state Department of Social Services. After she
was examined and interviewed at Cambridge Hospital, the child was
placed with a foster family.

   A protester whose flag-burning conviction was
overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court called the ruling an important
victory and his lawyer said it was not the insult some patriots
claim.
   But the Korean veteran who retrieved the fragments of the burned
flag said the court's ruling left him grieving.
   ``Some do not respect the country and the flag, its symbol,''
said Dan Walker of Fort Worth.
   The high court, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of Gregory
``Joey'' Johnson, of New York City, who was sentenced to a year in
jail and fined $2,000 for burning the flag in Texas.
   The court said the flag-burning at a demonstration in Dallas
during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of
expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
speech.
   ``I think it's an important victory ... that the Supreme Court
was forced to back off,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview from
New York. ``I think they got in a situation where it was too
exposing of their whole professed belief in freedom of expression.
   ``I've talked to thousands about the issues involved in this
case,'' he said. ``Many of them don't think burning the flag is the
most effective form of protest, but they were disgusted that the
very government that wrapped Ollie North in the flag to commit all
sorts of horrendous crime is now going to slap his wrist and was
attempting to jail an anti-patriot revolutionary.
   ``I don't consider myself an American,'' said Johnson, a member
of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade. ``I'm not. I'm an
internationalist, a proletarian internationalist.''
   His lawyer, Stan Weinberg of Dallas, said veterans should be
encouraged by the ruling because it shows that values fought for in
the Bill of Rights are intact.
   ``The flag is important and if that is what people believe, then
they should fly it,'' said Weinberg. ``That is the way that they
affirm their belief in it.''
   Justice William J. Brennan said a Texas law that bans conduct
leading to breaches of the peace is unaffected by Wednesday's ruling.
   But Brennan said it violates constitutional free-speech
guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests
merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or
because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of
national unity.
   But Walker said the ruling hasn't changed his opinion.
   ``I haven't mellowed any,'' Walker, a 61-year-old retired
engineer from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said in a telephone
interview. ``But I am convinced now that they can burn the material,
but not burn the spirit. So it is just the body they may kill, but
they will not kill the soul.''
   Walker said he was in the City Hall area the day of the flag
burning. He gathered the fragments of the flag and buried them. The
West Point graduate later received a letter of thanks from President
Reagan.
   ``It was uncalled for, and I still do not know what they were
protesting,'' Walker said. ``If they were interested in exercising
their freedom of speech, they should jolly be well be able to talk
and identify what it is that they were protesting.''

   A teen-ager challenging a law that
suspended his driving privileges for dropping out of school has his
license back, but only temporarily.
   His lawyer intends to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court
if necessary.
   Kanawha County Circuit Judge Paul Zakaib Jr. on Wednesday gave
attorneys for both sides 15 days to file documents supporting their
cases.
   The judge said 17-year-old Michael Means can drive for 30 days
while the attorneys compile more information and the court studies
the case.
   Means, a married Charleston teen-ager who dropped out of the
ninth grade last year, has appealed a Department of Motor Vehicles
decision to suspend his license under a first-of-its-kind law aimed
at reducing the state's dropout rate.
   Under the measure passed by the West Virginia Legislature last
summer, students younger than age 18 who miss more than 10
consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give
up their driving privileges.
   ``I didn't think in the long run that he was going in our
favor,'' Means' lawyer, Christopher Butch, said of the judge.
   But the attorney added: ``I fully expect to appeal this to the
(state) Supreme Court, and all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if
necessary because frankly this law is ridiculous.''
   After calling the judge's ruling fair, Means said he was somewhat
disappointed with the outcome.
   ``He can't just let me drive and then not let me drive. It should
be a yes or no answer,'' Means said. ``I think they're trying to
pressure me, to force me to enroll in a (high school equivalency)
program. I don't like being forced to do anything.''
   Butch argued that the law was in conflict with another state law
permitting students to drop out of school at age 16. The license
suspension, he said, was condemning the teen-ager and his family to
poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed to support
them without a driver's license.
   Means' 16-year-old wife, Tonya, who is expecting a child in
August, also had her license suspended because she is a dropout.
   Deputy Attorney General Bruce Wilson, who represents the
Department of Motor Vehicles, argued that revoking the decision to
suspend Mean's license would send the wrong message to other
teen-agers.
   ``It will encourage those people who want to avoid their
responsibility to the state and to themselves,'' Wilson said.
   Therese Wilson of state Department of Education testified that
since the law went into effect in the fall, 1,800 dropouts had
returned to the classroom. Of that number, 50 percent were still
attending school in March.
   In recent years, the state's dropout rate was about 17 percent,
or 5,000 students, she said. The state expected to reduce the rate
this year by 1,000 students as a direct result of the law, she said.
   Several states, including Wisconsin and Texas where Gov. Bill
Clements signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have passed similar
legislation and others are considering such laws.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing
newspapers to identify rape victims in some instances is unlikely to
change voluntary policies against doing so, a newspaper executive
said.
   The court ruled 6-3 that The Florida Star, a Jacksonville weekly
newspaper, doesn't have to pay $97,500 to a rape victim whose name
was published in 1983. Wednesday's ruling limits states' power to
punish the reporting of truthful information that is lawfully
obtained.
   Many news organizations, including The Florida Star, voluntarily
withhold names of victims of sex crimes. The newspaper's lawyers
said the woman's name was published inadvertently.
   Pete Weitzel, managing editor of The Miami Herald, said he didn't
think the decision will change what newspapers do. He pointed out
that the American press has become more sensitive to privacy issues
in recent years.
   ``I think all this really does is say you've got to make the
judgment yourselves,'' said Weitzel, chairman of the Florida Society
of Newspaper Editors' Freedom of Information Committee.
   The committee filed a court brief on the side of the Star.
   ``It was a pretty straightforward win,'' Weitzel said. ``It
bascially says, yes, you can go after a newspaper based on privacy,
but it must be on very narrow grounds.''
   The justices ruled that a state can punish the publication of
lawfully obtained information ``only when narrowly tailored to a
state interest of the highest order.''
   That interest was not present in the Star's case, the court found.
   Allowing censorship for an interest of ``the highest order'' will
have little practical application because that terminology
previously has been used only for national security matters, said
attorney George Rahdert, who represented the Star.
   ``It raises the fundamental question of whether a privacy issue
could ever be an interest of the highest order,'' Rahdert said.
   He said the ruling could have a wide ranging effect against
attempts at censorship.
   The victim's lawsuit was based on a Florida law that outlaws
printing, publishing or broadcasting the names of sex crime victims.
Weitzel said the editors' group has long questioned the
constitutionality of the law.
   Mitch Franks, assistant deputy state attorney general, said he
was uncertain what impact the court's decision would have on the law.
   ``We would urge, in the interest of protecting the victims of
crime, that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not
publishing the names of rape victims,'' Franks said.
   Star publisher Eric O. Simpson said he was pleased with the
ruling but regretted the award wasn't reversed by state courts.
   ``We were being denied (the right) to publish the truth,''
Simpson said. ``It constituted prior restraint.''
   The rape victim's name had been obtained from a report posted,
apparently by mistake, in the press room of the Duval County
Sheriff's Department.
   Had the court allowed the award to stand it could have lead to
passage of laws to prevent the publication of victim's names in
other types of crimes, Simpson said.
   ``A person being raped is no worse than a person being killed,''
he said.

injured, it said.
   No injuries were reported today. Yonhap said police planned to

   Radical students have staged a violent campaign to topple the
government. But their tactics and extreme views have failed to gain
public support.
   About 500 students, dissidents and others have been arrested and
charged with violent demonstrations or anti-state acts so far this
year.
   President Roh Tae-woo and other government officials have ordered
a continued crackdown on radicals.

   Rita Schwerner-Bender stayed away from
Mississippi for 25 years after the violent summer of 1964.
   But when she finally returned, she quickly showed why she and her
slain husband were in the vanguard back when the South was the
battleground of the civil rights movement.
   She broke a long silence about those bloody days in a scorching
speech to a crowd commemorating the 25th anniversary of the deaths
of Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney.
   The crowd listened intently as she recalled leaving Philadelphia,
a broken-hearted young widow. But when she spoke Wednesday, it was
as a gray-haired woman who has put the past behind her.
   Schwerner-Bender, who has remarried and lives in Seattle, quickly
made it clear she has not forgotten the sad lessons she learned
about hatred and prejudice in Mississippi and about the
Mississippians who were willing to fight against these evils.
   ``This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' she told the hushed
crowd. ``It's sad because it recalls personal pain but good because
I have the opportunity, after all these years, to say hello to many
people whose kindness and courage was beyond explaining.
   ``Mickey and I lived for six months in Meridian. During that time
we were housed and fed and befriended by people who took great risk
to take care of us and be our friends.''
   She said she has thought a lot about the significance of the
so-called ``Philadelphia-To-Philadelphia Project'' that brought
people from Pennsylvania and New York to commemorate the anniversary
of the three deaths.
   ``This isn't about just three men,'' she said. ``These men were
part of a continuum of history in the United States and in
Mississippi. Where should we start? With Rosa Parks, who sat in a
bus seat in Montgomery, and started a boycott which grabbed the
attention of a country which preferred not to know? With Medgar
Evers, whose efforts brought death to himself but whose work helped
to ensure the changes which were destined to occur?''
   By now, the crowd was urging her on as she ticked off a list of
heroic figures in the civil rights movement.
   She continued, ``And all the brave men and women whose names are
not part of the history books but who dared to risk their lives and
honor for a most overwhelming and simple concept _ that all women
and all men are born to be free, to live with dignity, respect and
hope.''
   She said she had had the difficult task of explaining to her
children, when they were young, why anyone would intentionally hurt
or kill another person. And she said she had had to try and explain
racism.
   ``We as a nation,'' she said, ``have yet to purge ourselves of
the cultural and institutional racism which was certainly a part of
Mississippi of 25 years ago, and continues to be a part of this
country today. I believed at that time, and I believe now, that if
all three of the men killed in Neshoba County 25 years ago had been
black, the nation would have taken little notice.
   ``This is a society which values some lives more than others.''
   She recalled how, during the years of the civil rights movement,
the states used their powers to deny blacks and others their
constitutional birthrights and how ``the FBI itself engaged in
deliberate activities to discredit and destroy the civil rights
movement.''
   The current and recent administrations in Washington, D.C., she
said, still are impeding efforts of people to secure unfettered
civil rights. She cited cutbacks of social services and recent
efforts by the Justice Department to roll back laws that deal with a
person's right to seek redress for racial or sexual discrimination.
   ``The backwards slide of the last several years must be
resisted,'' she said. ``The only appropriate honor to the many men
and women who have participated in this struggle is its
continuation.''

   Rita Schwerner-Bender stayed away from
Mississippi for 25 years after the violent summer of 1964.
   But when she finally returned, she quickly showed why she and her
slain husband were in the vanguard back when the South was the
battleground of the civil rights movement.
   She broke a long silence about those bloody days in a scorching
speech to a crowd commemorating the 25th anniversary of the deaths
of Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney.
   The crowd listened intently as she recalled leaving Philadelphia,
a broken-hearted young widow. But when she spoke Wednesday, it was
as a gray-haired woman who has put the past behind her.
   Schwerner-Bender, who has remarried and lives in Seattle, quickly
made it clear she has not forgotten the sad lessons she learned
about hatred and prejudice in Mississippi and about the
Mississippians who were willing to fight against these evils.
   ``This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' she told the hushed
crowd. ``It's sad because it recalls personal pain but good because
I have the opportunity, after all these years, to say hello to many
people whose kindness and courage was beyond explaining.
   ``Mickey and I lived for six months in Meridian. During that time
we were housed and fed and befriended by people who took great risk
to take care of us and be our friends.''
   She said she has thought a lot about the significance of the
so-called ``Philadelphia-To-Philadelphia Project'' that brought
people from Pennsylvania and New York to commemorate the anniversary
of the three deaths.
   ``This isn't about just three men,'' she said. ``These men were
part of a continuum of history in the United States and in
Mississippi. Where should we start? With Rosa Parks, who sat in a
bus seat in Montgomery, and started a boycott which grabbed the
attention of a country which preferred not to know? With Medgar
Evers, whose efforts brought death to himself but whose work helped
to ensure the changes which were destined to occur?''
   By now, the crowd was urging her on as she ticked off a list of
heroic figures in the civil rights movement.
   She continued, ``And all the brave men and women whose names are
not part of the history books but who dared to risk their lives and
honor for a most overwhelming and simple concept _ that all women
and all men are born to be free, to live with dignity, respect and
hope.''
   She said she had had the difficult task of explaining to her
children, when they were young, why anyone would intentionally hurt
or kill another person. And she said she had had to try and explain
racism.
   ``We as a nation,'' she said, ``have yet to purge ourselves of
the cultural and institutional racism which was certainly a part of
Mississippi of 25 years ago, and continues to be a part of this
country today. I believed at that time, and I believe now, that if
all three of the men killed in Neshoba County 25 years ago had been
black, the nation would have taken little notice.
   ``This is a society which values some lives more than others.''
   She recalled how, during the years of the civil rights movement,
the states used their powers to deny blacks and others their
constitutional birthrights and how ``the FBI itself engaged in
deliberate activities to discredit and destroy the civil rights
movement.''
   The current and recent administrations in Washington, D.C., she
said, still are impeding efforts of people to secure unfettered
civil rights. She cited cutbacks of social services and recent
efforts by the Justice Department to roll back laws that deal with a
person's right to seek redress for racial or sexual discrimination.
   ``The backwards slide of the last several years must be
resisted,'' she said. ``The only appropriate honor to the many men
and women who have participated in this struggle is its
continuation.''

<HEAD>Mayors Conference Ends on Discordant Note</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new leader of the nation's mayors is
confident the Bush administration will pay attention to urban needs.
But her optimism wasn't shared by all her colleagues at the end of
their annual conference.
   Houston's Kathryn Whitmire, a Democrat who is mayor of the city
President Bush calls home, assumed the presidency of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors as the group ended its five-day annual meeting
Wednesday.
   The mayors adjourned on a discordant note with an unprecedented
floor fight over future leadership of the conference.
   The contest was decided along party lines with the selection of
Boston's Mayor Raymond Flynn, a Democrat and outspoken critic of the
Bush administration, as a future president of the conference.
   Whitmire maintained an optimistic and conciliatory tone toward
the administration following the meeting and praised Cabinet members
and other administration officials who spoke to the mayors.
   ``After hearing from them, we are optimistic that our issues will
be on their agenda,'' she said.
   But mayors called on the White House to provide support for
increased federal aid to cities and for urban problems of drugs,
crime, homelessness and poverty. The mayors asked Congress for an
immediate $822 million increase in the fight against drugs.
   ``Urban America has been neglected over the last eight years, and
the need is even greater than before,'' said Mayor Arthur Holland
Jr. of Trenton, N.J., outgoing president of the group.
   Flynn's election capped a partisan fight for the job that puts
him in line to be president of the organization _ and leading
spokesman for the nation's mayors _ in 1991.
   Whitmire voted against Flynn and in favor of a Republican William
Althaus, mayor of York, Pa., in a vote that was otherwise decided
largely along party lines.
   Flynn said that at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were
willing to ``have an aggressive voice'' against Bush's urban
policies.
   ``I don't think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just
go along, to say everything's all right in our cities,'' Flynn said.
``Everything is not all right in our cities. ... The Federal
government has walked away from our cities.''
   The mayors devoted scant attention during their meetings to the
unfolding scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development _ the agency that handles most federal aid to cities.
The scandals include evidence of massive embezzlement and the
steering of millions of dollars in grants to projects based on
political favoritism during the Reagan administration.
   ``Frankly, our efforts with HUD will be primarily aimed at the
future rather than the past,'' Whitmire said. ``We do believe it is
the duty of Mr. Kemp (Secretary Jack Kemp) to address the scandals.
... Our goal will not be to chastise someone now gone from the
agency about what was done or not done last year.''
   The conference approved unanimously a policy statement calling on
the administration and Congress to raise federal taxes to reduce the
deficit and to finance greater spending on urban problems.
   The mayors also called for an outright ban on possession, as well
as manufacture and sale, of ``military-type'' semiautomatic assault
weapons. That goes far beyond Bush's ban on the importation of
foreign-made assault weapons and would, if it became law, render
illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by Americans.
   The mayors' resolutions become the new policies that will guide
conference lobbying in Congress.
   They approved a resolution saying mayors ``deplore'' recent
Supreme Court decisions that are weakening affirmative action
programs and ``making it more difficult to ensure equal
opportunities in employment for all Americans.''
   Other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs,
poverty, homelessness and AIDS. But in an earlier committee, mayors
deleted a proposal by Flynn to encourage free distribution of
needles to drug addicts as a way to reduce spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Test May Speed AIDS Treatment of Newborns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a new test, doctors may be able to begin
treating AIDS-infected babies soon after birth rather than waiting
more than a year to make sure they truly carry the virus, doctors
reported today.
   Babies of infected women have about a one in three chance of
picking up the AIDS virus from their mothers. But until about age 16
months, there is no foolproof way of sorting out which infants are
infected and which are not.
   Therefore, doctors have been unable to try early treatment with
the AIDS medicine AZT. The drug has been shown to help _ though not
cure _ youngsters with more advanced disease.
   Doctors caution, however, that the test may miss some infected
babies, and it is still too difficult to be used routinely. The
technique, known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, can spot the
genes of viruses that have invaded blood cells.
   ``It's something of a breakthrough. We have been very hindered by
the fact that we don't have diagnostic tests in infants,'' said Dr.
Martha F. Rogers of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``We need that critically,'' she added, ``because people would
like to start treatment with AZT very early on. But you are stuck
with treating every child born to a (virus) positive mother with a
fairly toxic drug, and you'll be treating some kids who don't have
the infection and don't need it.''
   Ordinarily, doctors check for AIDS infections by testing the
blood for antibodies to the virus. Those who carry antibodies are
presumed to be infected.
   This method is worthless for newborns. Babies whose mothers were
infected will carry their mothers' AIDS antibodies for months, even
if the babies themselves are not infected.
   ``This will be the key role of PCR,'' commented Dr. Cody Meissner
of New England Medical Center in Boston. ``We will be able to do a
test on the baby's blood in the first weeks of life, and hopefully
this will differentiate between kids who are truly infected and
those who are simply born to women who are infected.''
   Doctors have been reluctant to treat all newborns of infected
mothers with AZT until they can find out which ones are truly
infected. Otherwise they would be giving the toxic drug to twice as
many uninfected babies as infected ones.
   Rogers and colleagues at six New York hospitals tried out the
test on newborns of women infected with the AIDS virus. They report
their results in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the study, the test revealed AIDS infections in five of seven
newborns who later went on to develop AIDS. It also showed infection
in one of eight newborns who later had non-specific symptoms, such
as swollen lymph glands, that could have been caused by the AIDS
virus. The test results were negative in nine infants who remained
well.
   While childhood AIDS infections are rare in the United States,
they are becoming a major health hazard in parts of Africa. Another
study in the journal describes the results of a study on 475 infants
who were born to infected mothers at two hospitals in Zaire. The
research, directed by Dr. Robert W. Ryder of the Department of
Public Health in Kinshasa, concludes that AIDS may already have
increased infant mortality there by 15 percent.
   The study found that women with more advanced AIDS infections are
more likely to pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy.
Infected women are also more apt to deliver babies who are premature
or unusually small.

   Preservationists and admirers of author
John Steinbeck have won a temporary victory in their battle to save
a hotel he once frequented.
   Monterey County Superior Court Judge John Phillips ruled
Wednesday the city failed to obtain an adequate environmental impact
report before ordering the Cominos Hotel torn down.
   The building, built in 1874 and remodeled in 1919, was visited
often and mentioned in several works by Steinbeck, famous for such
books as ``The Grapes of Wrath'', ``East of Eden'' and ``Of Mice and
Men.''
   The city decided in April to raze the hotel for a parking lot,
office building and museum.
   But the Monterey County Historical Society sued, saying the
environmental analysis was deficient. The group actively promotes
Steinbeck's connections to the agricultural region.
   Preliminary studies indicate it would cost $4.5 million to
refurbish the hotel.
   Steinbeck, who won the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes, died in 1968.

   A Special Olympics athlete collapsed and
died after winning a swimming race.
   Edward Richardson, 42, had just won a 25-meter backstroke race
Wednesday when he collapsed in about 4{ feet of water at the
University of Florida. He was pronounced dead about 45 minutes later
at Shands Hospital.
   Richardson, who had Down's syndrome, was under water for no more
than 30 seconds before volunteers pulled him out and attempted to
revive him, said Susan Eisen, a volunteer timer.
   No autopsy is planned and the cause of death has been listed as
an ``apparent heart attack complicated by drowning,'' said Angie
Tipton, spokeswoman for the University Police Department.
   Richardson, of nearby Evinston, had won gold medals at the state
level in other Special Olympics races, she said. ``He was quite a
competent swimmer,'' she said.
   ``He'd been practicing for this for months.''

<TEXT>
   Panicked families are crowding the airport of a
Soviet Central Asian desert town where four people have been killed
in ethnic violence, Pravda reported today.
   Two people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds after the unrest
in the Kazakhstan town, Novy Uzen, spread Wednesday to settlements
40 miles away, the Communist Party newspaper said.
   ``The Novy Uzen airport is packed with families'' trying to leave
town, and threats by ``inciters'' of further violence are keeping
the 56,000 residents near the Caspian Sea on edge, Pravda reported.
   Most of the violence in Novy Uzen has been aimed at settlers from
the Caucasus Mountains region, who make up more than a third of the
town's population.
   Native Kazakhs complain the Caucasus settlers dominate the oil
industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential
treatment in housing and other benefits.
   The settlers have also set up private businesses that are accused
of selling supplies in the isolated town for exorbitant prices, the
newspaper Izvestia said.
   The Novy Uzen violence, which began last weekend, was the third
outbreak of ethnic rioting fueled by economic hardship in Soviet
Central Asia in the last six weeks.
   In the worst of the violence, about 100 people were killed in the
Fergana Valley of eastern Uzbekistan in attacks by ethnic Uzbeks
against the Meskhi Turkish minority, which was forcibly resettled
there by Josef Stalin in 1944.
   In Novy Uzen, more than 50 police and soldiers were reported to
have been injured while restoring order after a fight at a dance
hall erupted into four days of brawling and arson. Hundreds of
Interior Ministry soldiers were sent in, and a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew
was imposed.
   Izvestia said authorities have ordered increased security for the
town's water, sewer and electricity systems, as well as food stores
and a bread factory _ all targets of rioters who want to ``be able
to dictate their own conditions to the authorities.''
   Pravda said that although Novy Uzen was quiet Wednesday,
disturbances spread to Munaishi, where two people were hurt, and to
Zhetibai, where about 500 people demonstrated.

   The Foreign Ministry today urged Chinese diplomats
who defected following the crackdown on dissent to return home,
saying they were led astray by ``malicious instigation.''
   Spokeswoman Li Jinhua said some Chinese diplomats in embassies
and consulates abroad defected because ``they're far away from the
motherland and don't know the truth.''
   She said they had been ``disturbed by malicious instigation.
   ``We expect that they will come back to China and their families
and friends also hope they will come back. We have already contacted
relevant countries and hope they will provide help in dealing with
the relevant matter.''
   More than 20 Chinese diplomats have left their posts or sought
political asylum in the United States, Canada, Australia, Britain,
Japan and other countries following the June 3-4 military assault in
Beijing to disperse pro-democracy protesters and subsequent roundup
of anti-government activists.
   The government variously says 200-300 people, mostly soldiers,
died in the crackdown; Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence
reports indicate up to 3,000 may have died.

   Seven more ``rioters'' were executed today,
bringing to 27 the number reported put to death in two days for
their roles in protests against the violent suppression of the
pro-democracy movement.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the seven people executed in
Beijing today were convicted of setting army trucks on fire,
stealing army goods or assaulting soldiers when the military invaded
the capital on June 3-4.
   The executions were carried out despite international pleas for
clemency.
   They came a day after three men were executed in Shanghai for
setting fire to a train June 6 after it ran through a barricade,
striking and killing six protesters.
   Also Wednesday, 17 people were executed in the northeastern
provincial city of Jinan, a reporter for a local newspaper said by
telephone.
   Xinhua gave no details of today's executions other than to say a
court had rejected appeals of the seven, who were convicted Saturday
and included workers but not students.
   Most executions in China are with a bullet to the back of the
head.
   The Shanghai executions were the first announced for crimes
allegedly committed during nationwide protests after the army killed
hundreds of unarmed civilians in Beijing in June 4.
   None of the 27 people reported executed have been identified as
students, who inspired the pro-democracy movement.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said today it was
``futile'' for foreign countries to try to exert pressure on China.
She said suppression of the nationwide ``rebellion'' was an internal
affair and other nations should not interfere.
   She also urged the more than 20 Chinese diplomats who have
defected abroad to return home, saying they were led astray by
misinformation.
   Foreign leaders have urged China to be lenient with people
arrested for roles in the pro-democracy movement and for taking part
in protests once the crackdown began.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III, referring to the
execution of the three workers in Shanghai on Wednesday, said, ``We
deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said she was
``utterly appalled'' by the executions while Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke called the death sentences ``intolerable.''
   New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange said today that his
country would lodge a formal diplomatic complaint to demonstrate its
``revulsion'' at the executions.
   In Japan, the Kyodo News Service quoted Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno as saying, ``That this kind of thing should happen amid rising
international criticism is extremely regrettable.''
   Premier Li Peng on Wednesday said countries that try to exert
diplomatic and economic pressures on China, the world's most
populous country, are ``short-sighted and unwise.''
   The Foreign Ministry's Li said China hopes to maintain good
relations with the United States but, ``We firmly oppose the
American government interfering in China's internal affairs and
exerting pressure on China.''
   Washington has curtailed military sales and contacts and
suspended high-level meetings to protest the harsh suppression of
dissent.
   The 17 people executed in Jinan on Wednesday had been sentenced
the day before at a public rally, the reporter for the Jinan Daily
said. The reporter, who declined to be identified, said the 17 were
common criminals _ not participants in the student-led movement for
democracy.
   However, a local radio broadcast said Wednesday that the 17 were
among 45 people put on trial for taking part in disturbances in
Shandong province.
   Most major Chinese cities were wracked by demonstrations and
riots after the military assault in Beijing, which ran out of
central Tiananmen Square students who had for seven weeks agitated
for a freer China.
   More than 1,600 people, including student and labor activists,
have been arrested since the government crushed the pro-democracy
movement and began a campaign against dissent. The propaganda
barrage has included calls for people to inform on friends and
relatives.
   Official media today announced the arrest of 13 ``spies''
allegedly working for the rival government in Taiwan to foment
unrest during the student democracy movement.
   They identified one as Ou Zongyou, a Chinese man arrested in
Guiyang, southern China, said to have spread rumors, slandered the
ruling Communist Party, collected banned publications and taken
pictures of anti-state demonstrations during the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The other 12 alleged spies included three from Beijing, five from
Shanghai, two from Canton, one from Shenyang and one from Ningxia.
   The reports said they had been recruited by Taiwan military
intelligence or local agents to infiltrate the pro-democracy
movement. Television tape showed several of them joining
demonstrations and chanting along with the crowds in Tiananmen
Square before the military recaptured it.
   China's official press also reported 37 more people had turned
themselves in in Shanghai, bringing to 102 the number of Shanghai
residents who had surrendered to police. They included some leaders
of the independent student and citizens' groups that sprung up
during the protests.
   The Supreme Court has told local courts those who turn themselves
in and confess their wrongdoings should be given lenient treatment,
while those who resist arrest should be punished severely.
   Beijing radio said Zhou Chifeng, a student who helped organize
the ill-fated three-week student sit-in at Tiananmen Square was
arrested in the northeastern city of Changchun.

   The Who _ the guitar- and drum-smashing
rock band that once sneered, ``Hope I die before I get old'' _
launched its 25th anniversary tour, and nothing more than a
tambourine got broken.
   The graying rockers performed ``My Generation'' and 39 other
songs at a small arena here for an audience of about 5,000 people,
some of whom were not even born when the anthem of youthful bravado
was recorded in 1966.
   The Who is just one of a spate of old rock bands hitting the road
this year to coax Baby Boomers back into stadiums and concert halls.
   Ringo Starr, the Doobie Brothers and Allman Brothers will tour
this summer, with the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney following
this fall.
   The Who splintered after a ``farewell tour'' in 1982-83 but
regrouped for its 25th anniversary.
   Dressed in a baggy gray suit with his hair in a ponytail, Pete
Townshend leaped in the air and banged power chords on his guitar
with his trademark windmill motion. But in a concession to age and
hearing damage caused by years of loud music, Townshend strummed an
acoustic guitar for most of the show.
   Singer Roger Daltrey spun his microphone in the air and banged
two tambourines together until one shattered and he had to toss it
aside.
   The Who performed a series of their hits during the more than
three-hour show, including ``Won't Get Fooled Again,'' ``Who Are
You,'' ``Baba O'Reilly,'' ``Substitute'' and ``Can't Explain.''
   Townshend played three songs from his upcoming album, ``The Iron
Man.'' Bassist John Entwistle also performed solo.
   The three surviving band members were supplemented by 11
musicians, including a five-piece horn section. The Who's original
drummer, Keith Moon, died in 1978.
   Except for two indoor performances of ``Tommy'' in New York and
Los Angeles, the summertime tour is set for outdoor stadiums.
   The band made a last-minute exception in Glens Falls, an upstate
New York city of 20,000 where The Who rented the civic center for
nearly two weeks of rehearsal.
   The tour has been criticized by many in the music community, who
note that Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey haven't enjoyed the same
financial success with individual tours and records as they did with
The Who.
   The cover of the current Musician magazine features a drawing of
the band members as the centerpiece of a dollar bill.
   The tour moves to Toronto, the city that hosted the last
performance of The Who before their breakup.

<HEAD>Free Speech Advocates Back Court Ruling on Flag-Burning</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 11-12, Robert Spanogle, with reaction.</HEAD>

   Free speech advocates are hailing a Supreme
Court ruling in a Texas flag-burning case they say fortifies and
expands constitutional protection for political dissent.
   But conservatives and veterans groups expressed anger and sadness.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote Wednesday, said burning the American
flag as a form of political protest is protected by the
Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   The court said Texas authorities violated a protester's rights
when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or
destruction of the flag. The justices upheld a lower court ruling
that overturned the protester's conviction, one-year prison term and
$2,000 fine.
   The federal government and every state except Alaska and Wyoming
have similar laws against flag-burning.
   Professor Martin Redish of Northwestern University said the
ruling means ``the government cannot censor a viewpoint based on its
offensiveness.''
   He said he was delighted, and somewhat surprised, that Justices
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _ both appointed to the high
court by former President Ronald Reagan _ voted with the majority.
   ``I've been called an extremist for free speech. I'm in good
company now,'' Redish said.
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of the liberal People for the American
Way, said, ``As a nation, we are strong enough to withstand the pain
of seeing our flag burned. What we could not withstand is seeing the
First Amendment cast aside out of a misguided sense of nationalism.''
   But H.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, national commander of the American
Legion, said, ``As a veteran my first reaction to the decision is
one of anger. Then my anger turns to extreme sadness. This is a sad
day for the United States of America.''
   Robert Spanogle, national adjutant of the American Legion, said
on ``CBS This Morning'' that all Americans should fly the flag and
wear flag lapel tacks ``as a sign of positive protest'' of the
decision.
   ``We're going to seek legislation, and if it comes to the fact of
seeking a constitutional amendment to make desecration of the United
States flag a crime, we'll do that, too,'' he said.
   Alan Slobidin of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
said, ``for anyone who loves the flag this is an outrage ... a kick
in the teeth.''
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., also criticized the
ruling.
   ``In my view, the Constitution, for which millions of men and
women have given their lives to defend, holds no guarantee for
desecration, no basic right to deface,'' he said.
   The closely watched case echoed public-patriotism themes from
last year's presidential campaign and called to mind the political
turmoil during the Vietnam war.
   George Bush, campaigning for the presidency in 1988, attacked
Democratic opponent Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts for
vetoing legislation to require that public school teachers lead
their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. Dukakis said the
legislation was unconstitutional, and he said he resented Bush's
questioning of his patriotism. Both men made heavy use of American
flags during campaign appearances.
   During the height of U.S. involvement in the fighting in Vietnam
some two decades ago, draft card burning and flags bearing peace
symbols were common forms of protest.
   While Wednesday's ruling broadly limits the power of the state
and federal governments to restrict even offensive dissent, the
decision does not condone flag-burning that could incite a riot.
   The court said there are laws against breaches of the peace that
outlaw incitement to riot, and that those statutes are not affected
by the ruling.
   The central figure in the case was Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson of
New York City, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade.
   He was convicted of flag-burning during a 1984 rally at the
Republican National Convention in Dallas in which protesters
chanted, ``America, the red, white and blue. We spit on you.''
   The demonstration ended with the marchers pouring lighter fluid
on and igniting an American flag that authorities said was taken
from a pole outside a bank building.
   ``I think it's an important victory ... that the Supreme Court
was forced to back off,'' Johnson said. ``I don't consider myself an
American,'' Johnson added. ``I'm not. I'm an internationalist, a
proletarian internationalist.''
   The Korean War veteran who scooped up the fragments of the flag
said he is grieved that the conviction has been overturned. Dan
Walker, 61, a West Point graduate, said the burning was uncalled for
and ``I still do not know what they were protesting.'' He buried
what was left of the flag according to Army regulations and received
a letter of thanks from President Reagan.
   In another important test of the rights of free expression, the
court limited states' power to punish the news media for reporting
truthful, legally obtained information.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $97,500 award against a
newspaper, won by a rape victim whose name the paper had published.
   In other decisions Wednesday, the court:
   _Unanimously ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of
governmental advisory groups does not apply to the American Bar
Association's role in picking federal judges.
   _Voted, 5-4, to give railroads more leeway to sell off rail lines
without first entering into collective bargaining about the effect
of the sale.
   _Made it easier, in a case involving a dispute between the
Internal Revenue Service and the Church of Scientology, for the
government to conduct tax-fraud investigations.

<HEAD>Composer Henri Sauguet Dies in Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer Henri Sauguet, best known for his postwar
ballet musical score ``Musique des Forains,'' died at his home in
Paris today after a long illness, his family said. He was 88.
   Sauguet had been partly paralyzed for two years and had been
suffering from heart problems, his son, Raphael Luzel, said.
   Sauguet _ who was born Henri Poupard on May 18, 1901, in Bordeaux
_ studied the piano and the organ as a child.
   After World War I, he moved to Paris and met up with other
musicians of the era, such as Charles Koechlin, Darius Milhaud, and
Erik Satie.
   His first real success in the French capital came in 1924 with
the production at the Champs Elysees Theater of ``Le Plumet du
Colonel.''
   He went on to compose such ballets as ``La Chatte,'' directed by
Sergei Diagliev for the Ballets Russes and choreographed by George
Balanchine in Monte Carlo in 1927, Ida Rubenstein's ``David,'' and
Jean Giradoux's ``Ondine.''
   Besides his musical scores for at least 14 ballets, eight
theatrical productions, symphonies, quartets, collections of songs
and scores for some 35 films, Sauguet tried operatic scores.
   The lengthy ``La Chartreuse de Parme'' was produced in 1939 at
the Paris Opera. It received mixed reviews, and Sauget went back to
his first love _ ballet.
   ``Les Forains,'' which translates loosely as ``Wanderers'
music,'' was written for France's Roland Petit Company in 1945. Amid
the euphoria at the end of World War II, it touched a popular chord
and Sauguet's fame spread abroad.
   In the postwar years he composed mainly comic opera and later
wrote popular musical scores for children.
   In 1976 he was elected a member of the French Institute, to the
chair previously occupied by Milhaud at the Academie des Beaux-Arts.
   Sauguet is to be buried Tuesday at the Montmartre cemetery in
Paris.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German man who swam across a river to West
Berlin only to be dragged back by border guards has been freed by
East German authorities, Allied officials said today.
   The man was turned over to Western authorities one day after the
three Western Allies _ the United States, France and Britain _
threatened to cut off travel by politicians and diplomats to
communist East Germany unless the 21-year-old Martin Notev was freed.
   The Allies said the Notev had swum the Spree River and reached
West Berlin territory when he was seized by border guards on Feb. 14
and dragged back to East Germany by his hair.
   The guards returned Notev to East Berlin and he was later
sentenced to four years in prison. In a statement today, British
military authorities said Notev was released and reported to a
refugee camp in West Berlin on Wednesday.
   The Allies had called the East German guards' action a
kidnapping. They said Notev had already reached West Berlin
territory after swimming the Spree River, which separates communist
East Berlin from West Berlin.
   Notev and two friends used a truck to crash through border
barriers on the communist side of the river, jumped into the river
and swam to the Western side.
   The two friends made it safely up the bank but guards from a
patrol boat seized Notev as he was trying to get over the bank. The
guards pulled at Notev's hair and took him away, according to the
Allies.
   The Allies also said one East German guard violated Western
territory by stepping on the bank.
   Dramatic photographs in West Berlin newspapers showed Notev
trying to pull himself over the top of the steep bank as the guards
from the boat were dragging him away.
   The incident occurred near the old Reichstag building, in the
British sector of West Berlin. The Spree is in East Berlin territory.
   Tuesday's Allied protest, which West German newspapers described
as unusually strong, followed several unsuccessful attempts to win
Notev's release.
   The Allies said East Germany had failed to even acknowledge the
incident, while Soviet authorities said they were not responsible.
   Officials from the European Economic Community had also appealed
on Notev's behalf and his case had been raised by Britain and the
United States in talks with Soviet officials, Allied sources said.

   A man was convicted of murdering his wife and
11-year-old stepdaughter, who taped the slayings on a cassette
recorder later found tucked between the pillows on her bed.
   Prosecutor Tom Hannis said he will seek the death penalty against
Alfred Lavers at sentencing July 20.
   A jury deliberated 2{ hours Wednesday before convicting Lavers,
48, of first-degree murder in the 1988 stabbings of his wife, Mary
Lavers, and stepdaughter, Jennifer Burns.
   The 90-minute tape, played for the jury Monday, culminated in
Mrs. Lavers' screams.
   ``I'm dying. ... Please help me,'' she was heard saying.
   ``You're bleeding just like a stuck hog. I love you so mcuh,''
her husband replied.
   Defense attorney Roland J. Steinle contended Lavers stabbed both
in a rage. If jurors had believed there was no premeditation, they
could have convicted him of second-degree murder or manslaughter,
which carry lesser sentences.
   The couple had quarreled throughout the day about their
deteriorating one-year marriage. The fight spun out of control when
Mrs. Lavers refused to go to bed with her husband.
   In his closing argument, Hannis held up the girl's picture and
said: ``I had some help from Jennifer Burns. She put the tape in the
tape recorder and turned it on.''
   ``I sat and listened to the tape,'' said Judy Walker, a sister of
Mrs. Lavers. ``And I was warned ahead of time that it was going to
be gruesome. And I cried when it was played. We all cried.''

   The Israeli army today raided the West Bank
village of Silwad, fatally shooting a 22-year-old Palestinian who
refused to obey orders to stop and detaining 30 people, the military
said.
   Soldiers also sealed three Palestinian homes in and near the West
Bank city of Hebron after their residents were detained on suspicion
of attacking Israeli soldiers with firebombs, the army said.
   In Jerusalem, the body of an Israeli history professor was found
today, and police said they were investigating whether criminal or
terrorist motives were behind the stabbing. The body of Menachem
Stern was discovered by schoolchildren in a park across from
Israel's Parliament building, Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori
said.
   Sandori said robbery was ruled out because a watch and money were
found on Stern's body.
   Stern, 64, was believed to be walking from his home to nearby
Hebrew University when the attack occurred, Israel radio reported.
He was an expert on Jewish history during the Second Temple period.
The temple was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
   The army raid on Silwad, 10 miles north of Jerusalem, was the
latest in a series aimed at capturing Palestinian activists.
   The Palestinian fatality was identified as Abdel Raouf Mohammed
Hamad. The army spokesman's office said the victim was shot ``after
he refused to obey an order to stop.'' His death raised to 528 the
number of Palestinians killed since the start of the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 18 months ago.
Twenty-three Israelis also have died in the violence.
   The army said the 30 people detained were suspected of throwing
stones or firebombs at cars of passing Jewish settlers.
   Arabs from villages near Silwad said today they had received an
unsigned warning from Jewish settlers in the area threatening
retaliatory action against stone-throwers.
   ``We are seeking peace with you, but we are giving you a last
warning,'' said the fliers printed in Arabic and tossed on village
streets. ``If bloodshed continues, we are going to be forced to take
harsh measures against all who are behind the disturbances.''
   Jewish settlers in the territories have been blamed for a series
of assaults on Palestinians in recent weeks. About 70,000 Jewish
settlers live in guarded communities in the occupied lands, home to
1.7 million Palestinians.
   On May 29, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl was shot to death when
settlers raided the village of Kifel Harith in the West Bank.
   On Tuesday, a settler opened fire with an Uzi machine gun on
Palestinians near Tel Aviv, wounding two of them. The assailant was
captured by police.
   The shooting near Tel Aviv occurred shortly after hundreds of
angry Israeli settlers shouted down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at
a funeral of a settler slain in the West Bank. Three Palestnians
have been arrested in the killing.

   Mayor Coleman A. Young has agreed to pay $200 a
week to support the 6-year-old son he refused to acknowledge until
blood tests proved he was the father.
   The settlement filed Wednesday provides Annivory Calvert, mother
of Joel Loving, with support payments retroactive to Jan. 27, the
day she filed a paternity suit, said her lawyer, Noel Keane.
   The payments will continue until Joel turns 18 in 2000, when
Young, now 71, will be 82.
   Still to be determined is whether Young must pay support dating
to his son's birth in 1982, an amount Keane said would be at least
$50,000.
   Calvert, 34, a former city administrator, left Detroit earlier
this year to become public works director in Fontana, Calif.
   Lawrence Charfoos, an attorney for Young, said the mayor ``will
meet his financial commitment. He's starting to do that and he will
do it in the future.''
   He said Young had no comment on the matter.
   The agreement also says Young will be listed as Joel's father on
the birth certificate, Keane said.

<HEAD>Official Media Carry Faculty Statement on Katyn Blame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-run media today published a
university resolution blaming the Soviet secret police for the
massacre of Polish soldiers at Katyn in World War II.
   It was the most direct statement of blame reported by the
official press.
   The Warsaw University faculty condemned what it called efforts to
obscure ``the basic fact known in Poland and the world for nearly
half a century. Namely: the Katyn crime committed on thousands of
Polish officers interned by the Soviet Union in 1939 was committed
by NKVD (Soviet secret police) bodies.''
   The resolution was carried by the official PAP news agency and
was published in the daily pro-government Catholic Slowo Poszechne
newspaper.
   In recent months, the Polish government has moved toward
rejecting the official version of the Katyn massacre, which says the
4,200 officers were shot by the Nazis in 1941 after Germany invaded
the Soviet Union.
   Although discussion of Katyn was taboo in Poland for four
decades, most Poles and historians in the West believe the slayings
were carried out by the Soviet secret police on Josef Stalin's order
in 1940 while the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were allied.
   The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the
reserves and interned by the Soviets shortly after the outbreak of
the war, were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass graves
in Katyn, near the Soviet city of Smolensk.
   The fate of another 10,000 officers, interned at two other Soviet
camps, has never been revealed. They are also presumed to have been
executed.
   The Polish side of a joint commission investigating ``blank
spots'' in Polish-Soviet history has reported the tentative
conclusion of Soviet responsibility for Katyn, and a government
spokesman has said there is circumstantial evidence.
   But there has been no direct statement assigning blame and no
response from the Soviet side of the joint commission.
   The resolution said, ``The maneuvers around the Katyn crime
consist in attempts to create a false appearance that despite
obviousness, the Katyn case is very unclear and calls for long-term
research.
   ``Unfortunately, the Polish-Soviet commission of Communist Party
historians is also being used as a tool in these maneuvers.''
   The unanimous faculty statement critcized efforts to ``create a
cover and an excuse for all those who for nearly half a century have
tried to falsify the truth about Katyn, thus becoming the supporters
of the terrible crime.''
   The official media in Poland have written about Katyn this year,
and in April, soil from the Katyn graves was sent to Poland by an
official delegation.
   The official tablet on a Katyn monument in Warsaw that blamed the
Nazis has been removed.

<TEXT>
   A 1950s-era carwash with a thing that looks
like a tripod made of boomerangs on its roof lost a bid to be
designated a cultural landmark.
   The Cultural Heritage Commission voted 2-1 Wednesday to declare
the carwash with its eye-catching, 55-foot tower the official
Gateway to the San Fernando Valley and a symbol of Los Angeles' love
affair with the automobile.
   But the carwash needed three votes to become a cultural landmark.
The panel will vote again after a fourth commissioner is confirmed
by the City Council.
   Homeowners are seeking landmark status for the carwash and the
adjoining '50s-style Tiny Naylor's restaurant. Such a declaration
delays demolition for a least a year.
   A developer wants to tear down both buildings and put up a $15
million mini-mall.
   ``In this crazy world of Los Angeles, the carwash gives you 15
minutes to stop and smell the roses, to watch the suds,'' said Jack
McGrath, organizer of the save-the-carwash campaign.
   ``It's a chance for dad and son to talk a little bit while their
car is going through the wash.''
   Developer Ira Smedra, who wants to build the mini-mall, called
the monument idea frivolous. ``This is a terrible abuse of the
system,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A drug used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy to
prevent birth defects may itself harm the unborn baby, scientists
reported today.
   In the report, doctors linked the drug Tegretol, or
carbamazepine, with minor facial abnormalities and retardation.
Several other drugs to treat epilepsy, which afflicts an estimated
4.9 million Americans, also have been shown to be bad for the fetus.
   ``Physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very
difficult position,'' said Dr. Ronald V. Lacro, whose study appears
in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``This is the drug of choice, because it seemed to be safe. We
can't say that anymore.''
   Ciba-Geigy, which makes Tegretol, said the study is a reminder
that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant drugs need to be
weighed carefully, but the medicine should still be considered for
epileptics who want to have children.
   ``We feel that our past data show that Tegretol is a good option
for epileptic women. We still feel that way,'' said spokeswoman
Cathy Kernen.
   Lacro, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Boston, was a
co-author of the study directed by Dr. Kenneth Lyons Jones of the
University of California-San Diego.
   The report found evidence that women who took Tegretol during
pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed
development and mental retardation. They also were more likely to
have unusual facial formations _ including upward slanting eyes,
long upper lips and short noses _ and incomplete development of
finger nails.
   Studies have shown that severe epileptic seizures during
pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus,
causing brain damage. However, epileptic women have an increased
risk of producing babies with minor birth defects, even if they
don't have seizures during their pregnancies.
   ``Counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women,''
said Lacro. ``If the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the
medicine, then by all means you have to give it. But there is no
completely safe therapy other than being off medications.''
   The researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in
eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth. They
confirmed it by evaluating 48 other children whose mothers had taken
the medicine.
   They found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial
abnormalities, 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent
were slow to develop.
   Only one youngster with delayed development was old enough to
take an intelligence test. That child, a 6 year old, had an IQ of 65.
   Ciba-Geigy criticized the study for ``serious methodological
problems.'' It noted that the doctors used women who did not have
epilepsy in a comparison group. The higher risk of birth defects
among the children of the epileptic women might have resulted from

   Lacro said: ``I think that what we are seeing is due to the drug.
If the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone, then we would
see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure
drugs. I think the defects are drug specific, but I can't prove
that.''

<HEAD>Iran Reportedly Rejects Mediation Bids with Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has rejected several
recent attempts by third countries to mediate with Washington,
Iran's foreign minister was quoted as saying today.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati's interview in the
Dubai-based Arabic newspaper Al-Bayan was published as Iran's
parliament speaker visited the Soviet Union, the highest ranking
Iranian official to do so in a decade.
   Velayati said Iran was interested in good foreign relations as
long as that doesn't compromise its independence, Al-Bayan reported.
   ``Several countries have approached us for some kind of mediation
with the United States. But we reject that as the Islamic Republic
in Iran has never welcomed such mediations,'' Velayati was quoted as
saying in the interview in Tehran. The newspaper did not say when
the interview occurred.
   Velayati refused to give names of the countries which approached
Tehran for mediation nor to elaborate on relations with Washington,
said the paper.
   He said Iran wanted good relations with other nations, but only
if that doesn't require sacrifices of Islamic principles and
independence.
   He did not say in what way having relations with Washington would
be compromising for Iran. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died of a
heart attack June 3, repeatedly referred to the United States as the
``Great Satan.''
   Relations were severed in 1979 after students declaring
allegiance to Khomeini's Islamic revolution seized the U.S. Embassy
and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
   Velayati said Iran wants to improve relations with the Soviet
Union and Arab states on basis of mutual respect among neighbors.
   Iran's professed goal of spreading its Islamic revolution
strained its relations with several Arab nations.
   ``The Soviet Union is our neighbor, and we want to expand
bilateral ties with Moscow on basis of friendship and good
neighborly relations and not on the base of scaring others,'' he
said.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani has been in Moscow since
Tuesday to sign a number of economic and commercial agreements.
   Velayati said his country hoped to have good relations with Arab
states.
   ``At present we have strong relations with a number of Arab
states, but we have problems with others, and normalizing relations
with these depends on the ability of those countries to solve these
major problems,'' he said. Velayati said the problem nations include
Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   Iran has condemned Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel.
   Saudi Arabia broke ties in 1988, and strains persist with Tehran
especially over the restrictions the kingdom imposed on the number
of pilgrims to the annual Hajj to Mecca and Medina.

   A failed crane badly damaged a $70
million satellite that was to have beamed TV signals to India, says
McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The accident Monday, in which a heavy hook fell on the satellite
and destroyed an essential antenna, delayed McDonnell Douglas' plans
to be the first American aerospace company to put a commercial
payload into orbit.
   ``It looks like what happened is the cable simply snapped. It was
not lifting anything at the time, and there is no indication of
operator error,'' McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Sheila Carter said
Wednesday.
   The crane had been used to lift the satellite 116 feet to the top
of a Delta 2 rocket at a launch pad McDonnell Douglas leases from
the Air Force.
   Officials were still figuring the damage to the INSAT-1D
satellite, designed to transmit voice and data, weather pictures and
TV broadcasts to 700 million people on the Indian subcontinent.
   The launch, scheduled for June 29, has been postponed until the
satellite is repaired or replaced by its manufacturer, Ford
Aerospace.

<TEXT>
   One man was killed and another wounded
when a hand grenade exploded in their car near the British Consulate
in east Beirut, police said today.
   There was no immediate explanation for the explosion, which
occurred late Wednesday in the Jal el-Dib district. The wounded man
was taken to a hospital, ``and he'll be interrogated later,'' said a
police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations.
   He also said Syrian and Christian gunners traded howitzer and
machine gun fire in and around Beirut overnight and that seven
people were wounded.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to 373 people killed and
1,457 wounded since March 8, when the latest round of fighting began
in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Also today, two Israeli warplanes flew an apparent reconnaissance
mission over Lebanon, one day after Israeli jet fighters blasted a
Palestinian guerrilla base south of Beirut. Police said one
guerrilla was killed and seven wounded in the air attack, the ninth
by Israel in Lebanon this year.
   The guerrillas belonged to Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command.

   A jet made an emergency landing when 98
of the 139 passengers suffered dizziness and nausea after eating a
snack aboard the plane, and seven people remained hospitalized
today, officials said.
   None of the airliner's eight crew members ate the food, said

   The A-300 Airbus was en route Wednesday from Dhaka, Bangladesh to
Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, when the people fell ill after
eating a light meal consisting of chicken, Dareen said.
   The meal was catered in Karachi by the Midway Hotel run by
Pakistan International Airlines, he said. Samples of the food on
board were sent to laboratories to be examined.
   Medical officials said the seven passengers still hospitalized
suffered from dehydration but none was seriously ill.
   Fifty-two passengers spent the night in hospitals but 45 were
released today, Dareen said.
   Most of the affected passengers were Bangladeshis, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Holds Casino Responsible in Challenge to Free-Drink Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casinos can be held liable for money lost by
drunk gamblers, a federal judge ruled.
   ``A casino has a duty to refrain from knowingly permitting an
invitee to gamble where that patron is obviously and visibly
intoxicated and-or under the influence of a narcotic substance,''
U.S. District Judge Mitchell Cohen said Wednesday.
   The judge said casinos should fall under New Jersey's dram shop
laws, which hold taverns responsible for injuries caused by their
intoxicated patrons.
   Marvin B. Roffman, a gaming analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said the ruling is a blow to the casinos.
   ``If it holds up, what that means is anybody who was a big loser
can say, `Look, I had too many drinks. I don't owe anything,''' he
said.
   The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino had sued Schmuel Aboud of New
York for $30,000 in losses incurred in 1985 during a two-week
gambling visit. Aboud countersued, claiming he lost $200,000 because
casino employees plied him with free alcohol.
   The Golden Nugget had asked the judge to throw the case out,
arguing that no law holds casinos responsible for debts incurred by
intoxicated patrons.
   The ruling Wednesday allows the court case to continue toward a
finding of whether the Golden Nugget was responsible for Aboud's
losses.
   ``We were saying to the judge that unless these cases are cut off
at the pass, there will be a flood of these,'' said Stephen Dratch,
attorney for the Golden Nugget. ``Essentially, the judge is saying,
`That's the price you pay for being in this business.'''
   Aboud, whose gambling money came from a $395,000 settlement of an
auto accident case, also is suing two doctors the casino supplied
when he complained of back pain.
   He says the doctors gave him painkillers and that he lapsed into
unconciousness after washing them down with cognac offered by casino
employees.
   At that point, he claims, casino officials told him he would have
to wake up and continue gambling or leave his complimentary
$1,000-a-night suite.
   Atlantic City's 11 casinos have various promotions that provide
free drinks, meals, show tickets, rooms, transportation and coins to
gamblers, particularly to high rollers. Cocktail waitresses walk
among gamblers at slot machines and gaming tables taking drink
orders.
   The ruling could halt the serving of free drinks and could force
gaming hall operators to forbid drunk patrons from gambling, Roffman
said.
   ``I really don't think the casinos would win as much money if
they didn't offer drinks on the gambling floor,'' he said.
   Aboud's lawyer, Stephen Goldman, did not return calls Wednesday.

   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
   The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the German Navy when
it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the
Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys
of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when
England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air
power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five
days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss
of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of
World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.
   Ballard said the Bismarck was found ``in a remarkable state of
preservation. There doesn't appear to be as much damage as I had
expected.''
   Ballard is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about
600 miles west of Brest, France.

   The highest-ranking Iranian official to visit
Moscow since the 1979 Iranian revolution said today that talks with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had set once-stormy relations on a path of
close cooperation.
   ``The optimism that we had before the meetings has been totally
justified,'' the official, Hashemi Rafsanjani, told a news
conference after two days of talks with the Soviet leader.
   Asked about a recent series of bloody clashes in traditionally
Moslem Soviet Central Asia, part of which borders Iran, Rafsanjani
said that his country would not interfere in Soviet internal affairs.
   But he added, ``We consider Mr. Gorbachev has a long way to come
in providing freedoms and people's participation in the democratic
process.'' He did not elaborate.
   On other issues, Rafsanjani:
   _said the late Ayatollah Khomeini's order stands for the killing
of Salman Rushdie, British author of the novel ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous. Khomeini's
judgment was based on Islamic law and ``this is not the kind of
prescription that can be reversed. There is no one in Iran who could
reverse it.''
   _accused the United States of unspecified ``plots and
conspiracies'' against Iran when asked about the possibility that
relations would improve after Khomeini's death.
   _said Afghans must be free to resolve their differences without
outside interference after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from
their country more than four months ago.
   Rafsanjani originally was expected to leave today but extended
his visit. Tass reported that he left for Leningrad after the news
conference.
   Teheran Radio, monitored in London, said Rafsanjani also planned
to visit the southern republic of Azerbaijan, whose population is
predominantly Shiite Moslem. Iran has a consulate in the republic's
capital, which the Iranian broadcast called ``the Moslem city of
Baku.''
   Gorbachev and Rafsanjani agreed on a broad spectrum of economic
cooperation and Iran and the Soviet Union are expected to increase
joint efforts in areas including atomic energy, space and gas
processing.
   Rafsanjani suggested a joint Soviet-Iranian space voyage during
the visit, and Gorbachev ordered his deputies to begin working out
the details.
   Rail links between the two countries will be restored and another
rail line constructed, the official Tass news agency said.
   Rafsanjani invited Gorbachev to Iran. Gorbachev thanked
Rafsanjani for the invitation and said frequent high-level contacts
would be appropriate.
   No date was set for a Gorbachev visit.
   Topics discussed by the two included arms sales to Iran, but
Rafsanjani sidestepped questions about any deals with the Soviet
Union. He said only that Iran was trying to be self-sufficient in
arms but has some ``technical requirements that we would like to see
met by various sources.''
   Only a handful of Third World leaders have visited Tehran since
the Islamic Revolution in 1979 sent mobs into the streets shouting,
``Death to America, Death to Russia!''
   The Soviet Union was the chief arms supplier to Iraq during its
long war with Iran that ended in a cease-fire last August.
   Rafsanjani emphasized in remarks distributed by Tass on Wednesday
that several months before his death on June 3, Khomeini called for
better relations with the Soviet Union.
   Tass said Gorbachev and Khomeini exchanged messages in February,
and since then their foreign ministers have met four times.
   The Soviet Union has about 50 million Moslems, most of them
living in rapidly growing Central Asia, which borders Iran,
Afghanistan and China.
   The Soviet Union has been troubled in the past year and a half by
outbreaks of unrest among its more than 100 ethnic groups, and the
disturbances have spread in the last six weeks to Central Asia.
   About 100 people were killed in rioting in the Fergana Valley of
eastern Uzbekistan earlier this month.

   An African summit to resolve
Angola's 14-year-old civil war will fail without talks between the
rebels and the government, guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi said
before today's meeting.
   Speaking at his bush camp Wednesday, Savimbi also said that
``never in 14 years of war have we come so close'' to peace.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos left the capital,
Luanda, early today for Gbadolite, Zaire, where leaders of 22
African nations were gathering for the conference.
   In an interview with The New York Times published today, Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko said dos Santos would meet Savimbi during
the summit.
   But Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, made no mention of talks with dos Santos
during his news conference Wednesday in Boa Esperanca, in southern
Angola.
   Before leaving for Zaire, dos Santos commuted the death sentences
of 50 UNITA rebels condemned for high treason and terrorism between
1981 and 1987, the state news agency ANGOP reported.
   ANGOP reported Wednesday that the government released 700 rebel
prisoners June 2. The prisoners reportedly renounced the rebel
movement and accepted the government's offer of clemency, the
dispatch said.
   The goal of the summit was to clear the way for peace talks
between Angola's Marxist government and the rebels.
   Savimbi said his delegation in Zaire was flexible about
procedures leading to elections and formation of a national
government. But the rebels do not want any amnesty or clemency that
would imply they are criminals, Savimbi said.
   ``Our army, 75,000 men in the field, will not accept amnesty,
clemency or integration,'' Savimbi said. ``That wording has a
political context that means (the rebel army) is considered
criminal. Our army was not defeated and is not going to be
defeated.''
   Savimbi said he had agreed to stay out of the negotiations and
would not demand a role in any transitional government. He said,
however, that he would continue to head his party and also wants to
participate in free elections within two years of a formal
cease-fire.
   The government has rejected elections, saying it wants to
maintain one-party rule, with some rebels participating in the
administration.
   Under a peace plan put forward by dos Santos, Savimbi would go
abroad and recognize the legitimacy of the government, and the rebel
movement would then be integrated into the one-party state.
   Savimbi vetoed all these proposals.
   In six months, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have supported
the Angolan government will have left Angola under a U.S.-mediated
peace agreement reached in December.
   Savimbi's U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war
to force the Cuban- and Soviet-assisted government to share power
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   In addition to dos Santos, leaders from Zaire, Mozambique, Cape
Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome e Principe, Botswana, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Togo,
Congo, Mali, Chad, Central African Republic, Nigeria and Burundi,
were expected at the summit.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece's conservative party leader today
demanded that interim Premier Andreas Papandreou resign immediately
following reports of a new financial scandal linked to his socialist
administration.
   Banner front-page headlines today in the Athens press said the
scandal involved the laundering of $700 million through the Greek
Mortgage Bank and the Atlantic Bank of New York, a subsidiary of the
state-run National Bank of Greece.
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the New Democracy party, and
opposition dailies blamed Papandreou because the Mortgage Bank is a
state institution and its ranking executives are government
appointees.
   ``We have this new terrible scandal, and this usurper of
authority who shames and robs the Greek people must leave
immediately,'' Mitsotakis said at a news conference.
   The governor of the Mortgage Bank, Giorgos Anomeritis, denied
that branches of the bank in the United States had committed any
wrongdoing. ``Our branches are not allowed by law to accept deposits
and consequently they use other American commercial banks.
Therefore, they cannot be responsible either for illegal desposits
or the illegal transfer of funds,'' Anomeritis said.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, lost its
bid for a third four-year term in Sunday's election, winning only
125 of the 300 seats in Greece's unicarmeral parliament. Previous
financial scandals were blamed for the party's loss.
   New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of a clear majority that
would enable it to form a government.
   The communist-leftist alliance emerged as a power broker with 28
seats, and Mitsotakis is negotiating with the alliance to form a
coalition government.
   The money-laundering allegations were reported a day after
judicial investigators asked parliament to lift the immunity of two
former PASOK ministers so they can be prosecuted on bribery charges.
   Former Public Order Minister George Petsos is accused of
receiving gifts and other unspecified criminal acts.
   Former Deputy Premier and Justice Minister Agamemnon
Koutsogiorgas is accused of receiving a $2 million bribe from George
Koskotas, the fugitive owner of the Bank of Crete. Koutsogiorgas'
wife, Aliki, is accused of depositing the money in a Swiss bank
account shared by the couple.
   Koskotas is charged with offering the bribe and is being held in
a U.S. jail pending a hearing on a Greek extradition request.
   His lawyer, Yannis Mantzouranis, a former secretary to
Papandreou's cabinet, is charged with helping arrange the bribe.

<TEXT>
   A private panel formed to monitor the upcoming
Nicaraguan elections says it plans to conduct polls in that country
and seek a meeting with President Daniel Ortega.
   However, Curtin Winsor Jr., co-chairman of the Bipartisan
Commission on Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua, expressed
concern Wednesday about Managua's recent announcement that it will
require American visitors to have visas beginning July 1.
   Visas have not been required of Americans before.
   ``This has an element to it which suggests restriction,
restriction for press and foreign observer presence, and we hope
that will not be the case. It is a matter of some concern,
however,'' Winsor, a former Reagan administration ambassador to
Costa Rica, told reporters.
   In a letter to Leonor Huper, charge d'affaires of the Nicaraguan
embassy in Washington, Winsor and co-chairman Gaylord Nelson, a
former Democratic senator from Wisconsin, said the commission plans
to send its six commissioners and several staff members to Nicaragua
sometime this summer. The letter also asked for visa applications.
   Margarita Suarez, press officer for the Nicaraguan Embassy, said
she assumes the visas will be granted, but ``the official position
is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are
those that have been invited to be observers by the government.''
   ``There is really no restriction on the visas, unless someone is
really undesirable,'' Ms. Suarez said. ``There is no new
qualification that people must go through simply because they are
Americans.''
   Winsor spoke at a news conference at which the commission
released a report saying international observers, press and
broadcast media must be free to travel throughout Nicaragua during
the campaign to monitor the election process. The Nicaraguan
elections are scheduled for February 1990.
   Ms. Suarez said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the
report.
   Nelson did not attend the news conference but said in a statement
a number of delegation trips are planned to examine Nicaragua's
political climate.
   The first delegation plans to go to Nicaragua in late July or
early August and will request a meeting with Ortega, Nelson said.
   ``Another integral part of the commission's activities will
include a series of polls,'' Nelson said. ``The first poll will
examine the political and economic climate in Nicaragua and how the
Nicaraguan people feel about the possibility of free elections.''
   After that, he said, polls comparing support for opposition and
government candidates are planned.
   The commission released letters seeking meetings with President
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Winsor told reporters it was uncertain whether the Supreme
Electoral Council, whose members were chosen by Ortega, ``will
operate fairly.''
   Commission member Sergio Bendixen, a Democrat and international
political consultant, said, ``Even though there are some questions
about the composition of the council which may or may not be valid,
it is by the actions of the electoral council that they should be
judged.''
   ``If we find that the decisions of the electoral council are
being arrived at by consensus, I think that would be a very positive
point,'' Bendixen said. ``If on the other hand most of the votes of
the electoral council are 4-1 or 3-2, always in favor of the
Sandinista position, then I think the entire electoral process in
Nicaragua should be questioned.''
   The commission, which held three days of hearings in Washington
May 9-11, is sponsored by the conservative World Freedom Foundation.

   A sliver of light known as the ``sun
dagger'' missed its mark on an ancient Indian rock etching on the
opening day of summer for perhaps the first time in 1,000 years,
scientists say.
   A shift in the position of a 9-foot-tall slab of sandstone atop
nearby Fajada Butte, probably because of erosion, changed the angle
at which the light fell Wednesday.
   ``It's very serious and sad,'' said archaeo-astronomer Ana
Sofaer, who is credited with discovering the ``sun dagger'' 12 years
ago. ``We knew when we first saw the site that it had a fragility
that was remarkable.''
   Researchers believe that the rock drawing, or petroglyph, was
carved between 950 and 1150, at the peak of the Anasazi Indian
culture.
   It is believed the carving was a kind of calendar, with the rocks
arranged to cast distinctive patterns of light and shadow across it
on important days of the year. The ``sun dagger'' occurred on the
summer solstice, the first day of summer when the sun is at its
highest point of the year in the Northern hemisphere.
   Distinctive patterns of light are also cast at the winter
solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes _ when day and night are
of equal length.
   ``We're used to this thing acting like a clock,'' physicist Rolf
Sinclair said.
   When the solstice arrived Wednesday, the dagger widened,
lengthened and missed the circular dawing entirely, appearing above
and to the left.
   Michael Zelik, a physics and astronomy professor at the
University of New Mexico, said it's clear the rocks have not moved
much, if at all, over the years. He said the erosion noticed this
year may be due to 10 years of wet weather.
   Many researchers believe England's ancient rock monument known as
Stonehenge is also arranged to take advantage of the summer solstice.

   Security forces killed one person and
wounded another when they shot into an opposition political rally.
The government today accused the main opposition party of inciting
unrest and ordered it to stop.
   It was the sternest statement to date issued to the National
League for Democracy and came one day after the shooting at the
rally organized by the league.
   ``The government has been tolerant for a long time. The party
concerned will have to bear the consequences of irresponsible and
illegal acts,'' a spokesman for the military government told a news
conference. ``It must be remembered that martial law is in force.''
   The spokesman, Kyaw San, accused the party and its leader, Aung
San Suu Kyi, of inciting the public to defy laws, of urging students
to form ``suicide squads,'' and of organizing demonstrations to
commemorate last year's pro-democracy uprising.
   Wednesday's incident appeared to be one of the most serious
outbreaks of anti-government agitation since September, when troops
crushed demonstrators in a hail of gunfire.
   The official Radio Rangoon said Wednesday night that about 500
people gathered at Myenigon Circle north of downtown Rangoon to give
``agitating speeches,'' chant slogans and lay bouquets at the site.
   Witnesses said demonstrators were honoring pro-democracy
demonstrators killed by government forces at the spot on June 21,
1988.
   The radio said security personnel fired five warning shots to
disperse the crowd and took into custody Aung San Suu Kyi. She was
released after being ``warned not to create disturbances,'' the
radio said.
   While the opposition leader was in custody, 100 of the
demonstrators ``shouted and charged at security personnel with what
appeared to be an intent to attack the security personnel,'' the
radio said.
   One person was killed and one wounded when one of the security
men fired three shots ``to stop the charge,'' the broadcast added.
   The radio also said one ``disturbance maker'' was arrested with
24 pamphlets inciting trouble as 30 youths tried to enter the campus
of Rangoon University on Wednesday.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of a late national hero, Gen. Aung
San, has emerged as the leading opposition figure to Burma's
military government, headed by Gen. Saw Maung.
   The government has promised elections next year and allowed the
formation of political parties but still rules by martial law
decree. Some campaigning by the opposition groups has been allowed
but on occasion Aung San Suu Kyi and others have been harassed.
   Burma has been under authoritarian, military-backed rule since
1962, when Gen. Ne Win overthrew a democratic government. Last year,
the country exploded into violence as hundreds of thousands took to
the streets to demand democracy.
   Several thousand civilian protesters were killed over a period of
several months before Saw Maung stepped in to take power.

<HEAD>US Officials Say OAS Mediation in Panama a Failure</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New lead to include Baker comment; inserts grafs 8-9, Testifying

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials have virtually given up hope
that Organization of American States mediators will be able to
succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in Panama, but
Secretary of State James A. Baker III remained publicly optimistic
today.
   One official dismissed the mediation as a ``corpse'' and said
alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to step down.
   Three OAS mediators, aided by Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares, have made two visits to Panama over the past month to
attempt to seek a solution to the country's political crisis.
   On their last visit, the mediators left some ideas with the two
most powerful political blocs in Panama and with the Defense Forces
on how to promote a dialogue.
   Baena Soares is ``neither optimistic nor pessimistic'' about the
prospects for success but believes the progress achieved to date has
been satisfactory, according to an aide.
   But a U.S. official criticized the effort, saying ``the OAS has
fallen on its face on this.''
   The official, asking not to be identified, said U.S. diplomats
from around the hemisphere have been trying to enlist governments
from Latin America and the Caribbean to support the U.S. position.
   Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee this
morning, Baker said today he remains ``very hopeful'' that the OAS
mediators will be successful.
   He reaffirmed the longstanding U.S. view that there can be no
normalization of relations with Panama so long as Noriega remains in
power.
   The United States has been attempting to force Noriega out of
office since he was indicted by two Florida grand juries on drug
smuggling charges in February 1988.
   But few, if any, governments in the hemisphere are as
unswervingly opposed to Noriega as the United States. Many are
reluctant to intervene in Panama's internal affairs, while others
see the issue as a U.S.-Panamanian problem that should be dealt with
as such, the officials said.
   The official State Department position is that the mediation
effort should not be judged until July 19, the deadline for the
mediators to submit a report on their activities to OAS foreign
ministers.
   The administration believes the only acceptable solution is for
Noriega to agree to step down as Defense Force commander before the
deadline. Privately, officials say there is no sign that will occur.
   The crisis arose last month when Panama's electoral tribunal,
dominated by Noriega's allies, tossed out the returns from the May 7
presidential elections. Independent observers said the opposition
slate had won by a landslide.
   There was indignation throughout the hemisphere when, three days
after the election, opposition candidates were beaten by government
security agents. A week later, the OAS mediating team was set up.
OAS foreign ministers blamed Noriega for the ``grave events and
abuses'' in Panama.
   But much of the anti-Noriega sentiment has dissipated over the
past six weeks, generating pessimism here that the mediators will be
able to fulfill their mandate.
   The officials said the administration is weighing a series of
options for bringing additional pressure to bear on Noriega,
including the seizure of his overseas assets, believed to number in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.

<HEAD>Giscard d'Estaing Calls for Joining of Main Opposition Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing has called
for unifying France's conservative parties and said this is the only
way to wrest power from the Socialists.
   Giscard d'Estaing made the comments in an interview published
today in the newspaper Le Figaro and in comments on television
Wednesday night.
   He is president of the Union for French Democracy, a federation
of five small center-right parties. The other main opposition party
is the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic.
   Giscard d'Estaing's comments came after his party and the Rally
for the Republic joined forces in European Parliament elections
during the weekend. The list of candidates put forward by the
parties finished first with 28.9 percent of the vote, leading
Laurent Fabius' Socialist list which had 23.6 percent. Simone Veil's
separate centrist list won 8.4 percent of the vote.
   ``It was division that caused the opposition to lose'' last
year's presidential and legislative elections, Giscard d'Estaing
said. ``It is union that will cause it to win.''
   Jacques Chirac, the president of the Rally for the Republic who
lost his bid last year to unseat Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, reacted coolly to Giscard d'Estaing's idea. He told
today's opening session of the party's National Council there would
be no ``fusion'' of the two parties.
   ``We have no intention of fusing with anybody, but reinforcing
the links of solidarity'' between the opposition groups, he said.
   Giscard d'Estaing said a convention of the opposition parties
should be held soon and a new, unified party created before the end
of the year. Such a party, he said, would still be a place where
ideas could be debated.
   The Socialists have the advantage of a single party, and while
that party has its different wings, once decisions are made, or
candidates designated, its leadership usually pulls together.
   It is the lack that cohesiveness that troubles the opposition.
   In last year's presidential elections, Chirac had to battle not
only Mitterrand, but the Union for French Democracy's Raymond Barre
and the National Front's Jean-Marie Le Pen. Mitterrand calmly ran
his own campaign, with only the small Communist thorn in his side.

   An army officer was killed today in a
highway shootout between a man who kidnapped him and law enforcement
officers, police said.
   It was not immediately clear who shot Col. Karel van de Kieft,
who was kidnapped at gunpoint as he left for work at about 6:45 a.m.
   Police spokesman Bert Albers said the kidnapper was identified as
Stefan Kroger, a 33-year-old from Hanover, in West Germany.
   In Hanover, Justice Ministry spokesman Hartmut Mollring said that
Kroger was serving a five-year jail term in West Germany for several
armed robberies and had been at large since May 10 when he failed to
show up after a one-day prison furlough.
   Albers said the kidnapper forced Van de Kieft, 56, into his car
at gunpoint near the victim's home in Apeldoorn, 10 miles north of
the eastern city of Arnhem.
   Police, alerted by a neighbor, chased the car and caught up with
it at a gas station on the Arnhem-Utrecht freeway, said Albers.
   Police fired at the kidnapper, who was in the car with his
victim, and a shootout ensued in which Van de Kieft was killed,
Albers said.
   The motive of the kidnapping was unclear, although at one point
the kidnapper demanded $450,000 ransom, according to Albers. He said
the victim and the kidnapper were apparently not acquainted.
   Kroger told police he was wanted by West German and Swiss police
in connection with several armed robberies, according to Albers.
   Albers said it was unclear whether Van de Kieft was hit by the
kidnapper or by police.

<HEAD>Libel Judgment Upheld Against Ohio Newspaper, but Strict Guidelines
Retained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today unanimously upheld a
$200,000 libel award against Harte-Hanks Communications, but its
ruling did not appear to weaken significantly the news media's
protection against libel lawsuits by public officials and public
figures.
   The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against
Harte-Hanks because of a 1983 article in the Hamilton, Ohio,
Journal-News. But the decision also said the appeals court issued a
misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and
investigation by the media.
   The lawsuit against Harte-Hanks, which formerly published the
Hamilton newspaper, was filed by Daniel Connaughton, a Hamilton
lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a
1983 election against incumbent James N. Dolan.
   A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the Journal-News said one of the women
who offered testimony before a grand jury investigating alleged
corruption in the municipal court system ``claims Dan Connaughton
offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida `in
appreciation' for their help'' in the investigation which he
instigated.
   The article quoted the woman as saying she thought Connaughton
used ``dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with his
investigiation of Billy New, the court's chief administrative
officer.
   The woman who was quoted in the article, and was its only source,
was one of seven people who had attended a meeting with Connaughton
when the offer allegedly was made. The others who attended denied
that any offer of jobs or a Florida trip was made.
   Connaughton sued Harte-Hanks three months after he lost the
election. A federal jury awarded him $5,000 in compensatory damages
and $195,000 in punitive damages.
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ``The
evidence in this case, when reviewed in its entirety, is
unmistakably sufficient to support a finding of actual malice.''
   Despite that, the decision today adhered to a 1984 ruling in
which the nation's highest court said appellate courts must
second-guess juries that rule for public officials and public
figures in libel suits against news media defendants.
   In that 1984 decision, Bose vs. Consumers Union, the justices
said appeals courts have broad authority _ and a constitutionally
required obligation _ to review jury verdicts that favor public
officials and public figures who sue for libel.
   To win such a suit, a public official or public figure must prove
the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with
``actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.
   According to the record in today's case, Connaughton filed a
private criminal complaint about five weeks before the election with
Hamilton police based on corruption allegations against New, the
administrative officer.
   Connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paid
bribes to New to ``fix'' cases, and that one of the women said some
of the transactions occurred in Dolan's presence.
   New eventually was convicted of bribery. Dolan was not indicted.
   But Connaughton's campaign contended that Dolan bore the ultimate
responsibility for ``any failure to manage the court or its
employees.''
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld the
award last year, rejecting Harte-Hanks' arguments that the 1984
Supreme Court decision required a reversal of the jury verdict.
   The appeals court said the 1984 call for independent appellate
review does not apply to a case's facts but instead ``was limited to
a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of
actual malice.''
   Today, the justices said the 6th Circuit court's language was
misleading.
   The appeals court opinion could appear to mean that a newspaper
faces liability if it strays from ``the standards of investigation
and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers,''
Stevens said, but that is not the same as `actual malice.'
   Harte-Hanks has since sold the Journal-News. Its new owner is
Dean Singleton.
   The case is Harte-Hanks vs. Connaughton, 88-10.

<HEAD>$12.1 Million Settlement Reached in Lie-Detector Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federated Group, a West Coast chain of
40 electronics stores, has agreed to pay $12.1 million to as many as
15,000 employees and job applicants who were required to take
polygraph tests.
   The settlement comes 18 months after four applicants filed a
class-action suit claiming the lie-detector tests violated both a
California Labor Code ban on involuntary polygraphs and the state
constitutional right to privacy.
   The agreement, announced Wednesday, is subject to approval by a
Superior Court judge.
   ``It tells all employers that workers do not hang up their rights
at the door of the workplace,'' Brad Seligman, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said in a statement.
   The suit was filed on behalf of all applicants and employees of
the Federated Group in California since Nov. 23, 1983.
   The company may have given 15,000 polygraph tests since 1983, the
plaintiffs said.
   Gregory Pratt, chief financial officer for Atari Corp., said the
tests were discontinued shortly after Atari bought the Federated
Group in 1987 for $67 million.
   According to the suit, one woman was told she ``had the job''
before she was given a polygraph test, in which she was asked if she
had ever been to a psychiatrist or a therapist.
   She refused to answer, saying the question was too personal, and
was told she was ``neurotic and high strung,'' according to the
suit. She did not get the job.

   A Soviet ballerina won a gold medal today when she
danced with an American in one of the world's top ballet
competitions.
   Galina Stepanenko was paired with Michael Shannon of Los Angeles
in the International Ballet Competition held in Moscow's Bolshoi
Theater.
   Contestants were judged individually, and only Stepanenko won a
medal.
   Dancers Christina McDermott of Switzerland and Vladimir Malakhov
of the Soviet Union also won gold medals, the Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   For Soviet and American dancers to compete on the same team ``is
really revolutionary in dance and especially in competitions,'' said
Amanda Olmstead, the contest's spokeswoman. ``Think of the Olympics,
where the Americans and Soviets are always the ones hitting heads.''
   The two-week contest is similar to the Olympics, with dancers
competing for gold, silver and bronze medals. No Americans won
medals.
   Jury members said the level of competition was unimpressive this
year.
   Stepanenko and Shannon danced the pas de deux from ``Don
Quixote'' in the final round.
   The International Ballet Competition alternates each year among
Moscow; Varna, Bulgaria; Helsinki, Finland; and Jackson,
Mississippi. Past medalists include Mikhail Baryshnikov and Natalia
Makarova.

<HEAD>Report Sees Home Ownership Among Young Americans Declining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home ownership among young Americans is
declining alarmingly and ``threatens to produce a permanent
underclass of disadvantaged renters,'' a Harvard University study
released today said.
   The annual report on the state of the nation's housing, released
by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, said the
homeownership rate for households in the 25-29 age group fell to
36.2 percent in 1988. In 1980, it was 43.3 percent.
   For households in the 30-34 age group, the rate fell to 52.6
percent, off nearly 10 percentage points from the 1976 rate of 62.4.
   The report also said that 30 percent of the nearly 5.7 million
unsbsidized housing units renting for less than $300 a month are
physically inadequate and ``at risk of loss.''
   It said single-parent households, accounting for an increasing
share of the nation's total population of children, are the most
vulnerable to the cost crunch.
   The median income of a single parent under 25 was $6,223 in 1988,
down 15 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from 1974, the report
said.
   At the same time, it said, 71 percent of all single-parent
households pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent.
   ``Because it is rooted in fundamental social, economic and
demographic factors, this trend is not easily reversed,'' the study
said. ``Left unchecked it threatens to produce a permanent
underlcass of disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the long-term
financial security of future generations.''
   The study offered no specific solutions to the housing problems
it identified, saying that they are ``subject to debate'' but that
``policymakers must act to develop creative approaches to advance
the goal of decent housing for all.''
   The study was co-authored by William Apgar and Denise DiPasquale,
professors at the joint center.

<TEXT>
   A traveling lightning-rod salesman has
been ordered to return thousands of dollars bilked from senior
citizens and has been banished from Indiana for five years.
   James E. Sherlock, 47, pleaded guilty Wednesday to
home-improvement fraud for selling shoddy and overpriced rods.
   Circuit Judge William C. Vaughn said it was the first time he had
banished anyone. ``It's a good idea for Indiana,'' he said.
   ``Five years is a fairly long time, and if he steps foot on
Indiana soil he will be arrested,'' said Calvin C. Hultquist, senior
investigator in the consumer protection division of the Indiana
attorney general's office.
   If arrested anywhere in the nation during the five years,
Sherlock could be returned to Indiana to serve the remainder of the
period in prison.
   Sherlock, who has no known address, also made $23,427 in
restitution, about 90 percent of what a dozen Hoosiers paid for
lightning rods.
   Mark C. Webb, one of Sherlock's attorneys, said the agreement was
fair.
   O. Emmitt Griffith, who paid $2,000 for lightning rods and filed
the complaint that led to Sherlock's arrest in April, said he was
pleased with the banishment.
   ``I hope he never comes back,'' he said. ``I know he couldn't do
any good around my house, and most of my neighbors know about him
now.''

<HEAD>Southern African Officials Oppose International Ivory Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa opposes an
international effort to ban the ivory trade, a government spokesman
said today.
   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, which must cull their
elephants to keep the population under control, say such a ban could
drive up the price of illegal ivory and doesn't take into account
legal ivory exports that generate income for conservation programs.
   ``Our basic position is that we do not support a total ban on the
ivory trade worldwide,'' said Bosman Olivier, a spokesman for the
Department of Environmental Affairs.
   Olivier said South Africa wanted to make its position known but
does not plan to campaign in support of ivory trade.
   ``In South Africa we have a very healthy elephant population that
must be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' he
said. ``The selling of the ivory in a legal manner makes good
sense.''
   South Africa earns $2 million annually from the sale of elephant
tusks at the culling program in Kruger National Park, Olivier said.
The money is spent on animal research and maintaining the park, he
added.
   Dick Pitman, chairman of the Zimbabwean conservation group the
Zambezi Society, said there is a question whether bans ``really work
or whether they merely raise prices and drive trade underground.''
   Soaring ivory prices in the last decade have fueled a killing
spree that has cut Africa's elephant population from an estimated
1.5 million in the 1970s to less than 700,000 today, experts say. An
average tusk weighs 11 pounds and can fetch $109 a pound on the
international market.
   This month, the United States, Canada, the 12-nation European
Economic Community, Switzerland and Canada have imposed bans on
ivory imports that make elephant poaching profitable. The EEC, Japan
and the United States consume up to 75 percent of the ivory in world
markets.
   The 102-member Convention In Trade Of Endangered Species will
consider such a ban in an October meeting in Geneva.
   Kenya, one country that supports a total ban on the trade, today
announced plans to destroy 12 tons of ivory the government has
seized from poachers, and it urged other nations to do the same.
President Daniel arap Moi gave no specific date for the incineration.

   Rising water forced hundreds of people from their homes in

flood watches went up Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia,
West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed today over the Plains, with
the heaviest rain over Iowa, where 6.80 inches fell at Stanton and
6.20 inches fell near Vallisca.
   In the Pennsylvania town of Ridgway, about 200 people were
evacuated Tuesday and Wednesday before the Clarion River crested at
about 6 feet over flood stage, said county Emergency Management
Coordinator Ed Zettle. The water covered Ridgway's main bridge.
   In Jefferson County, about 300 people were evacuated at Brockway
and nearby Snyder, and about 15 families sought higher ground at
Reynoldsville.
   Brockway Police Chief Clarence Bish said officials ordered the
evacuation as a precaution because a dike holding back Toby Creek
has been temporarily lowered from 16 feet to 14 feet for the
construction of a bridge.
   The Monongahela River overflowed Wednesday onto the wharf in
downtown Pittsburgh, where hundreds of commuters park every day.
Some were forced to use buckets to remove water from their cars.
   Alabama's Gov. Guy Hunt ordered National Guardsmen to deliver
sandbags to families in Bingham in Elmore County and water to 300
residents in the Plantersville area of Dallas County where a water
system shut down.
   Emergency management officials said heavy rain washed out a
bridge and ruptured water lines.
   Cotton fields were reported under water in the county.
   ``A year ago our farmers were praying for rain. Now, many of
those same farmers are wondering when it's going to end,'' said
Goodwin Myrick, president of the Alabama Farmers Federation.
   Early today, high wind during a thunderstorm downed trees at
Cullman, Ala., and during the six-hour period up to 8 a.m. EDT,
Huntsville got an additional 2.55 inches of rain.
   In Georgia's Colquitt County, rain has combined with high
temperature to spread two fungus-based diseases to cucumbers, said
Scott Brown, a Georgia Extension Service agent. The diseases could
cost some cucumber growers half their harvest, he said.
   Elsewhere in Georgia, rain has hampered harvesting of the roughly
20 percent of the wheat crop that remains in the field, agriculture
officials said, but the moisture has been a blessing for crops such
as peanuts, corn, soybeans, tobacco and cotton, which will be
harvested later in the year.
   Early today, residents in two central Ohio communities piled up
sandbags around the banks of the Licking River in an attempt to hold
back flood waters that threatened their homes and businesses.
   While rain plagued the eastern portion of the nation, Colorado
was dealing with another form of precipitation on the first day of
summer Wednesday.
   Rain turned to snow at elevations above 7,500 feet in Teller
County and in the Evergreen area west of Denver. Light snow was
falling early today over the Colorado mountains, at Evergreen and at
Woodland Park, with a fresh 8-inch covering at Mount Evans.
   ``Happy summer, huh?'' complained a dispatcher for the Teller
County Sheriff's Office.
   The region chilled to record lows today, including 34 at Casper,
Wyo.; 35 at Cheyenne, Wyo.; 38 at Scottsbluff, Neb., and 42 at
Colorado Springs, Colo. Rapid City, S.D., hit a record low of 39,
after Monday's record high of 102.

   Legislation was introduced in the Senate today
to name a small plot of land across from the Chinese Embassy here
Tiananmen Square Memorial Park.
   ``It would express, silently and reverently, the sorrow Americans
feel for those who were slaughtered in Beijing, those who are now
facing brutal treatment in public trials and those who have or will
become victim to vicious public humiliation and execution,'' said
Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., one of the bill's three principal
sponsors.
   ``Every time Chinese diplomats look out of their windows, they
will be looking on a place of free thought and speech,'' said Sen.
Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill. ``Hopefully, over time, these principles will
sink into the hard hearts of the present brutal regime.''
   Meanwhile, 26 senators asked President Bush not to give in to
demands by the Chinese government to turn over astropohysicist Fang
Lizhi, a prominent dissident who has been granted diplomatic asylum
in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   ``Our nation owes it to those who died in Tiananmen Square and to
those who will live with the silent memories of the brutal massacre
forever etched into their hearts to do all it can to protect this
courageous and noble man,'' the senators said in a letter to the
president.

   House Democrats today elected a member of the
ethics committee to a post in their leadership.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., was elected vice chairman of the House
Democratic Caucus on the second ballot of a four-way race.
   Fazio, 46, bested his nearest rival, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
by a 2-1 margin in the race to fill the last vacancy remaining from
the party shakeup triggered by the resignation of House Speaker Jim
Wright. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
finished far back.
   Fazio is 10-year House veteran and a member of the ethics
committee, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, that brought the charges that led to Wright's resignation.
Frost, a member of the powerful House Rules Committee, was one of
Wright's most ardent defenders.
   Fazio is also the co-chairman of a bipartisan task force which is
studying changes in the House rules of ethical conduct.
   Fazio won a majority on the second round of balloting with 147
votes to 74 for Frost and 32 for Kaptur.
   On the first ballot, it was Fazio 113, Frost 69, Kaptur 37 and
Durbin 34. Durbin dropped out for the second round.

   All but $1 million of the $7.2 million that federal
auditors said might be missing from the Denver office of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development has been accounted for,
the agency's local director says.
   ``We have got the money,'' Isaiah ``Ike'' Kelley, acting regional
HUD administrator, said Wednesday. ``It's in the Treasury, which has
been substantiated.''
   Auditors from the inspector general's office have given the HUD
office until June 30 to account for the missing records on 173
foreclosed homes sold in the past five years for $7.2 million.
   The HUD central accounting office in Washington has confirmed
that more than $6.2 million of that money was received, Kelley said.
   ``But they want to see the paper records on this. I don't know
why,'' he said.
   HUD auditors in Washington said they were unsure whether the
files and the remaining $1 million were simply misplaced or are
missing.
   The Denver HUD office is a major focus of a nationwide inquiry of
fraud, influence peddling and political favoritism at HUD during the
Reagan administration.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier for Communities to Turn Down Volume on Rock
Concerts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
communities to turn down the volume on rock concerts, upholding New
York City's effort to avoid ear-splitting noise levels in Central
Park.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said officials may require sponsors
of rock concerts in the park's Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell to use a
sound system operated by a city-designated engineer.
   That requirement does not violate the freedom-of-expression
guarantees of the Constitution's First Amendment, Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy wrote for the court.
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said
city officials had to devise a ``less restrictive'' way to satisfy
their concern over noise levels.
   ``This less-restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a
part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place and manner
regulation'' on expression, Kennedy said.
   He added: ``The city's sound amplification guideline is narrowly
tailored to serve the substantial and content-neutral governmental
interests of avoiding excessive sound volume and providing
sufficient amplification within the bandshell concertground.
   ``Accordingly, it is valid under the First Amendment as a
reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expression,''
Kennedy said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the court
``plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the
damage that it does to our First Amendment rights.''
   Calling New York's requirement for a city-run sound system at
rock concerts ``an impermissible prior restraint,'' Marshall said,
``Because judgments that sounds are too loud, noise-like, or
discordant can mask disapproval of the music itself, government
control of the sound-mixing equipment necessitates detailed and
neutral standards.''
   Quoting one music critic, the 80-year-old Marshall added, ``New
music always sounds loud to old ears.''
   He was joined in dissent by Justices William J. Brennan and John
Paul Stevens.
   The city's noise-control campaign is aimed at protecting visitors
to the park's neighborhing Sheep Meadow, a 13-acre area decreed a
``quiet zone'' by Mayor Edward Koch in 1985, and residents of a
fashionable neighborhood called Central Park West.
   The city policy was challenged by Rock Against Racism, which
sponsors an annual bandshell program of speakers and musical groups.
   The case is Ward vs. Rock Against Racism, 88-226.

<HEAD>US Skeptical of Soviet Proposal on Palestinian Vote</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 7 grafs new with Baker comment; picks up at pvs 3rd graf,
The official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is skeptical of a Soviet
proposal to seek advice from the U.N. Security Council's permanent
members on proposed elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West
Bank and in Gaza, administration sources say.
   And Secretary of State James A. Baker, appearing today on Capitol
Hill, again registered U.S. opposition to moves by the Soviets and
the European Economic Community for an international peace
conference on the Middle East.
   ``We have tried to discourage the Soviet Union and the EEC from
pressing forward,'' Baker said. ``...It could be detrimental to the
prospects for direct negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians.''
   But at the proper time, and ``properly structured,'' an
international conference could be helpful, Baker told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   He said some supporters of a conference were now inclined to give
the idea of Palestinian elections a chance to develop. He did not
identify the countries under questioning by the committee.
   As for apporaching the United Nations about elections, an
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said late Wednesday:
``We said we weren't interested.''
   He said the United States did not reject the idea outright. But,
the official said it was unlikely to get anywhere ``as far as we're
concerned.''
   The official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold
elections to choose Palestinian representatives to negotiate
self-rule with Israel.
   ``It would only muddy the waters and distract from the
(elections) idea itself,'' the official said.
   Participation by the council members would guarantee the Soviet
Union a role that Israel fears would be used to the advantage of the
Arabs.
   The five members of the Security Council are the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   The Soviets, without committing themselves on Palestinian
elections, made their proposal during a two-day meeting in
Washington last week on the Middle East. It was one in a series of
conferences on various global problems arranged by the two
superpowers.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by John Kelly, assistant secretary
of state for the Near East, and Dennis Ross, head of the
department's policy planning staff. Vladimir Polyakov, senior expert
on the Middle East in the Soviet Foreign Ministry, led his
government's delegation.
   The Soviet idea was first disclosed in Thursday editions of The
Star Tribune of Minneapolis.
   The elections were proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir as a way of breaking the stalemate between the Arabs and
Israel. The idea has qualified U.S. support, provided arrangements
are satisfactory to the Palestinians and the Arab countries.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has rejected Israel's offer
as a subterfuge to block the creation of a Palestinian state. But
the Bush administration is operating on the assumption that the
Shamir proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only
known vehicle for starting negotiations.
   For this reason, the official said, the Soviet proposal to
consult the U.N. Security Council members on a proper framework
received a skeptical U.S. response.
   The official said the Soviets did not endorse or reject Shamir's
proposition. As in the past, the Soviets said only that it was
``worthy of consideration.''
   In the past, as an inducement to Israel, the Soviets have said
they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once
negotiations began. But the official said the Soviets did not repeat
this offer in the Washington sessions.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel in 1967 when Israel
defeated a combination of Arab countries in a six-day war.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government May Confiscate Money from Criminal Defendants</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 17-23, In other action, with other cases.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today the government
may confiscate from criminal defendants money and property they
intended to use to pay their legal fees.
   The justices, in separate 5-4 votes in cases from Virginia and
New York, handed federal prosecutors a major victory in their fight
against illegal drug dealing.
   The court said a defendant's constitutional rights to due process
and to be represented by a lawyer in a criminal case are not
violated when profits of an allegedly illegal enterprise are seized.
   Justice Byron R. White, who wrote for the court in both cases,
said no one has a constitutional right ``to spend another person's
money for services rendered by an attorney, even if those funds are
the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney
of his choice. The money, though in his possession, is not
rightfully his.''
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``It is
unseemly and unjust for the government to beggar those it prosecutes
in order to disable their defense at trial.''
   He said the court ``should heed the warnings'' of federal trial
judges who ``understand, perhaps far better than we, the devastating
consequences of attorney's fee forfeiture for the integrity of our
adversarial system of justice.''
   Blackmun was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   In one case decided today, the law firm of Caplin &amp; Drysdale here
was denied $170,000 in legal fees for representing Chistopher
Reckmeyer. He pleaded guilty in 1985 in Virginia to charges stemming
from what prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a
multi-million-dollar drug operation.
   Reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. The seizure of the money
left him without funds to pay Caplin &amp; Drysdale.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
Reckmeyer was not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the
law firm.
   In the second case, the former Reagan administration appealed a
ruling that would have allowed Peter Monsanto access to assets worth
$400,000 to help him pay his lawyers.
   Monsanto was convicted in New York City of charges he headed a
heroin-selling ring.
   The jury also had ordered him to forfeit to the government a
house in Mount Vernon, N.Y., valued at $335,000, a $30,000
cooperative apartment in the Bronx and $35,000 in cash.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year
Monsanto could use the assets to pay legal fees incurred in his
defense.
   At issue in both cases were forfeiture provisions of key federal
crime-fighting laws, including the Continuing Criminal Enterprise
Act and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations statute.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Gave cities important new protection against big damage awards
when they are accused of violating people's civil rights.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court narrowed the scope of a century-old
civil rights law invoked by a former Dallas high school football
coach who said he lost his job because he is white.
   _ Unanimously upheld a $200,000 libel award against Harte-Hanks
Communications. However, its ruling did not appear to weaken
significantly the news media's protection against libel lawsuits by
public officials and public figures.
   The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against
Harte-Hanks because of a 1983 article in the Hamilton, Ohio,
Journal-News. But the decision also said the appeals court issued a
misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and
investigation by the media.
   _ Made it easier for communities to turn down the volume on rock
concerts, upholding New York City's effort to avoid ear-splitting
noise levels in Central Park.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said officials may require sponsors
of rock concerts in the park's Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell to use a
sound system operated by a city-designated engineer.
   In one of the forfeiture cases, Caplin &amp; Drysdale and other
attorneys argued that confiscating the assets of people when they
are indicted will leave them too poor to pay their own lawyers.
   But White today compared the plight of the accused drug dealer to
that of a robbery suspect.
   A robbery suspect has no constitutional right ``to use funds he
has stolen from a bank to retain an attorney to defend him if he is
apprehended,'' he said.
   ``If defendants have a right to spend forfeitable assets on
attorney's fees, why not on excercises of the (constitutional) right
to speak, practice one's religion or travel?'' White asked
rhetorically.
   Also, he said, a defendant's assets may be frozen before
conviction if there is probable cause to believe the money or
property was obtained illegally.
   The forfeiture cases are Caplin &amp; Drysdale vs. U.S., 87-1729, and
U.S. vs. Monsanto, 88-454.

   Airport officials defended their handling of a
program in which lucrative contracts intended to help women and
minorities benefited the wife of Rep. Julian Dixon and other
politically well-connected people.
   ``No one's getting any favors here,'' Los Angeles Airport
Commission member Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said at a meeting Wednesday.
   Betty Dixon and her husband, chairman of the House ethics
committee, earned more than $100,000 last year on a 1986 investment
of less than $15,000 in Peideau and Mir Kanon Inc., according to
Dixon's financial statement.
   The companies are part of a joint venture awarded a concession to
operate duty-free and gift stores at Los Angeles International
Airport.
   John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, was also
involved in the joint venture. Both he and Mrs. Dixon have
acknowledged that their involvement in running the businesses has
been minimal. Like others in the program, they are backers of Mayor
Tom Bradley, who appoints airport commission members.
   The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is intended to
encourage companies to invite women and minorities to become
partners in airport businesses so they can gain experience to help
them compete on their own.
   Under Federal Aviation Administration rules, minority
participants are expected to take on day-to-day responsibilities in
the businesses.
   Airport commission Chairman Samuel Greenberg and others defended
the panel's selection of participants.
   ``All of the processes took place in a forthright and public
fashion,'' said Clifton Moore, executive director of the Department
of Airports.
   But he acknowledged the matter should be looked into in more
detail. The commission hired a consultant to do that.

   The NAACP says it has raised $50,000 to save the
home of Juanita Jackson Mitchell, one-time matriarch of Baltimore's
civil rights movement.
   First American Bank of Maryland bank planned a foreclosure sale
Friday of the row house, for more than 40 years a meeting place for
activists who met in the living room to plot strategy with Mrs.
Mitchell, her late husband, Clarence, an NAACP lobbyist, and her
brother-in-law, former Rep. Parren J. Mitchell.
   ``We have no doubt now that we'll be able to save this home,''
said George Collins, a trustee of the Mitchell fund, organized by
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Mrs. Mitchell is bedridden at age 76 after two strokes, and her
sons, former state Sens. Clarence B. and Michael Mitchell, have not
been able to help her because they are in prison for fraud in the
Wedtech corruption case.
   Mrs. Mitchell defaulted on a $60,000, 90-day loan for which she
pledged the three-story house as collateral in 1987. The bank said
it extended the due date six times and waited seven more months
before starting foreclosure.

   A congressional panel investigating influence
peddling in federal housing programs wants a U.S. ambassador to
explain how he was named developer on several lucrative projects to
refurbish federally subsidized housing for the poor.
   Philip Winn, ambassador to Switzerland, was one of several
witnesses called today to tell the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing how contracts were awarded
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's moderate
rehabilitation program.
   Winn, a former assistant secretary of housing, led a group that
included several other former HUD officials in the Reagan
administration and won development contracts for at least seven
projects in the West and Southwest.
   ``Abuse and favoritism were pervasive at HUD in awarding these
scarce and desirable moderate rehabilitation funds,'' said
subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   ``We are eager to hear from these witnesses how projects they
pushed came to be selected by HUD for federal subsidies over many
competing projects,'' Lantos said before the hearing.
   Among Winn's partners were Silvio DeBartolomeis, former general
deputy assistant secretary for housing; J. Michael Queenan, the
former director of HUD's Denver regional office; and Philip Abrams,
a former HUD undersecretary.
   According to a HUD inspector general's report, one proposal from
the group to develop 202 units of the Windsong Apartments in Tulsa,
Okla., was chosen after Abrams told the local housing authority how
it could obtain funding.
   Abrams was also scheduled to testify today; DeBartolomeis
testified earlier this month.
   Joseph Strauss, a former special assistant to then-HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, was the first witness.
   Strauss received $1.3 million in consultant fees in connection
with 13 moderate rehabilitation projects. Former Interior Secretary
James Watt told the panel earlier this month that he instructed a
developer to send Strauss $131,000 of the $300,000 fee Watt was to
receive for a consulting job.
   Strauss testified that he retained Watt in March 1984 as a
consultant to his company, Phoenix Associates, because he had
problems getting responses from HUD for his clients.
   A letter, which Strauss read and said formalized his relationship
with Watt, noted Watt's ``well developed flair for innovation.''
   Lantos asked Strauss if he had hired Watt to use his influence.
   ``That's what this letter says,'' Strauss responded.
   A HUD inspector general's report said the Winn group ``utilized a
number of corporate titles'' to buy projects that might be eligible
for the program. The group would approach local housing authorities,
advise them to apply to HUD for funding and the units and then help
local officials prepare solicitations for proposals on the projects.
   In one instance, Queenan notified the housing authority in
Richland, Wash. it had been awarded 158 units before the HUD
regional office in Seattle was even aware of the funding, the HUD
report said.

   Pope John Paul II has dedicated the church's
next World Day of Peace to the ecological crisis, the Vatican said
Thursday.
   Stressing that the goods of the Earth must not be used ``for
selfish ends, for profit or power alone,'' the Vatican said the need
to respect the environment is a new challenge to peace.
   ``Peace with God the Creator _ Peace with all of Creation'' is
the theme for the day, which the Roman Catholic Church marks on Jan.
1.
   The theme chosen by the pope, it said, is an invitation to
reflect on the ecological crisis from a moral perspective.
   ``The Earth and all that it contains are a common heritage for
humanity. This should be the governing principle for the use of the
goods of the Earth by nations and the international community to
which these goods are entrusted,'' the Vatican said.

<HEAD>Surprise Catch in Speed Trap: A Sun-Powered Three-Wheeler</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A solar-powered car's speed test went
a little too well when police nabbed the driver for going 55 mph in
a 50 mph zone.
   ``I believe it's the first solar vehicle ever caught for
speeding,'' said Rene Jeanneret of the Bienne Engineering School,
the car's chief designer.
   The three-wheeled ``Spider'' was going 5 mph above the speed
limit when police stopped it outside this city Monday, Jeanneret
said.
   The incident occurred during road tests after the vehicle's
gearbox was changed to improve its performance on the Alpine stages
of an upcoming race for solar-powered vehicles through Switzerland.
   Jeanneret said the modification actually makes the car slower.
   ``We were lucky,'' he said, noting that the Spider has a maximum
speed of nearly 65 mph.
   He declined to identify the driver, who was fined 20 Swiss francs
(about $11.75).

<HEAD>U.N. Soldiers Accused of Chipping Meteorite, a National Treasure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaysian soldiers serving with the
United Nations force in Namibia were accused Thursday of trying to
chip souvenirs from the world's largest known meteorite, a Namibian
national monument.
   U.N. officials are investigating the incident, which reportedly
involved about 36 soldiers who turned up with a truck and began
trying to cut pieces from the giant slab near the northern town of
Grootfontein.
   The Hoba Meteorite, named for the farm on which it was discovered
in 1920, is a 66-ton boulder of iron, nickel, chrome and other
metals. Although on private property, it has been declared a
national monument and is visited by about 18,000 people a year,
officials say.
   Malaysia has about 900 soldiers in Namibia, one of the two
largest military contingents in the United Nations Transition
Assistance Group supervising the former South African colony's move
toward becoming an independent state.

   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   Ballard said he could only speculate on why the German commander
decided to send his vessel to the bottom in May 1941. He said
perhaps it carried technologically advanced equipment that the
Germans did not want to fall into British hands.
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
said.
   In 1939, after a battle with three smaller British ships, the
German pocket battleship Graf Spee was cornered in the neutral port
of Montevideo, Uruguay. Adolf Hitler ordered it scuttled, possibly
to prevent the British from learning the secrets of its construction
and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's four main guns were quickly
knocked out of action and the attacking British ships were out of
range of the Bismarck's secondary guns, Ballard said. With the ship
helpless and taking hundreds of hits, its sinking was clearly
inevitable, he said.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered the ship to save
lives, Ballard said there was no mast left on which a white flag
could have been hoisted.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire,
Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have
been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the German
fire had ended.
   The British ships did halt their gunfire but continued to send
torpedos, Ballard said. However, he said, the lack of evidence of an
implosion in the remains persuaded him that the ship had been
blasted open by its own crew rather than sunk by British torpedoes.
   He said he would keep secret the exact location of the Bismarck
and let the German people decide its future fate.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
   The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the German Navy when
it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the
Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys
of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when
England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air
power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five
days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss
of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of
World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.
   Ballard said the Bismarck was found ``in a remarkable state of
preservation. There doesn't appear to be as much damage as I had
expected.''
   Ballard is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about
600 miles west of Brest, France.

<HEAD>Priest Charged With Profiteering From Papal Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest appeared in court
Thursday on charges he sold papal souvenir blankets for more than 10
times the legal price.
   The state alleged the Rev. Joseph Musonda, secretary general of
the Catholic Secretariat, and church fund-raiser Valentine Musakanya
engaged in profiteering by selling 220 blankets for about $120
apiece after Pope John Paul II's May 2-4 visit.
   It was also alleged the Catholic Secretariat did not obtain
statutory approval from the trade and commerce ministry to import
the blankets.
   Under government pricing laws, the top price of a blanket was
fixed at about $9.
   Lusaka magistrate Matthew Mukubesa, who recessed the hearing to
June 26, did not ask Musonda to enter a plea on the charges, which
carry the penalty of a fine related to the alleged pricing
infringement.
   Roman Catholic churches in Zambia have said they raised an
undisclosed sum from donations and souvenir sales to finance the
pope's visit.
   Earlier this month, the government's Prices and Incomes
Commission said it was investigating sales of mugs and T-shirts
emblazoned with John Paul's portrait at inflated prices.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Award of Attorneys' Fees in TWA Bias Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside an award of
more than $180,000 in attorneys' fees stemming from a 1970 sex-bias
lawsuit against Trans World Airlines by female flight attendants.
   In a 6-2 decision, the court said people who intervene on the
side of defendants in civil rights cases _ but who themselves are
not found to have violated anyone's rights _ generally cannot be
forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who
successfully sue.
   The complicated case stems from a lawsuit filed 19 years ago that
challenged TWA's policy of firing female flight attendants when they
became mothers.
   The suit was resolved in 1979 when TWA agreed to reinstate fired
women, and grant them seniority from the date of their dismissal.
   The airline, which had abandoned its ``no motherhood'' policy
soon after the suit was filed, also created a $3 million fund for
the fired attendants.
   The settlement was challenged by the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants on behalf of TWA flight attendants who could have
suffered by being laid off before those with the newly won seniority.
   The union acted in the case as an intervenor, a concerned third
party not named as a plaintiff or defendant.
   The union's challenge to the settlement ultimately failed, and
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ordered the union to
pay $180,915 toward the legal fees incurred by the female flight
attendants who sued.
   But the Supreme Court said today that the appeals court wrongly
presumed that the union was liable under a federal law allowing
courts to make such lawyer-fee awards.
   Such intervenors are liable under that law, Justice Antonin
Scalia wrote for the court, only when their intervention is
``frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.''
   The court sent the case back to the 7th Circuit for further study.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented, and
Justice John Paul Stevens did not participate in the case.
   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs.
Zipes, 88-608.

<HEAD>Report Finds Home Ownership Among Young Declining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home ownership is declining among young
Americans but increasing among those 65 and older, according to a
Harvard University study released Thursday.
   Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its annual
report on the state of housing in the United States that the home
ownership rate for those in the 25-34 age group was 45 percent in
1988, down from 52.3 percent in 1980.
   Among households headed by people 65 and older, however, the rate
increased from 72.3 percent in 1980 to 75 percent in 1988. The
report said that many of those people already owned homes before
housing costs increased in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Young people, the study found, are increasingly unable to
accumulate the down payment and other costs involved in buying a
house.
   ``This trend is not easily reversed,'' the report said. ``Left
unchecked, it threatens to produce a permanent underclass of
disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the long-term financial
security of future generations.''
   The study was co-authored by Harvard professors William Apgar and
Denise DiPasquale.
   ``The situation is likely to worsen,'' Ms. DiPasquale said at a
news conference. ``Federal budget cutbacks and expiring use
restrictions threaten the subsidized housing stock.''
   The report said inflation-adjusted rents for poor people living
in unsubsidized units increased 34 percent from 1974 to 1985.
   ``As long as these trends persist, the gap between those who can
afford decent shelter and those who can't will continue to widen,''
Apgar said.
   Single-parent households, which account for an increasing share
of the nation's total population of children, are living in some of
the worst housing, the report said.
   The median income of a single parent under 25 was $6,223 in 1988,
down 15 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from 1974, the report
said. At the same time, 71 percent of all single-parent households
pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent.

<HEAD>Soldier-Spy Had No Plan When He Entered East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULDA, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier who pleaded guilty to
espionage charges says he didn't know what he was going to do when
he crossed the border to communist East Germany, a military
newspaper reported today.
   Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, 22, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., pleaded
guilty to charges he gave defense secrets to East Germany when his
court martial opened Wednesday. Peri could be sentenced to life in
prison on the espionage charges.
   Peri disappeared from his unit, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment
in Fulda, on Feb. 21. He returned voluntarily 11 days later.
   ``I was never really sure what I was going to do at all,'' Peri
told the courtoom after changing his plea from not guilty to guilty,
according to an account in the Stars and Stripes, the Armed Forces
unofficial newspapers.
   ``I really didn't have a plan. My primary reason was to leave
behind all the frustrations and problems at work,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying about his decision to leave his unit.
   ``Everything had been wrong. I wasn't enjoying myself. I wanted
to start over somewhere else,'' the Stars and Stripes quoted his as
telling the court in response to a question from Col. Craig. G.
Jacobsen, the presiding judge.
   Peri disappeared with a lap-top computer from his unit, where he
worked in the military intelligence section as an electronic signal
interceptor.
   ``I was looking at Soviet forces on paper (at work) and I wanted
to see it firsthand,'' the newspaper quoted his as saying.
   ``I took the computer to run the software because I didn't think
the Soviets would have one. It was a bargaining chip to keep them
from doing something to me. It would show them that I wasn't an
American plant,'' the paper quoted him as telling the court.
   Peri said he used a multipurpose military vehicle to drive to the
East German border because it was a headquarters vehicle and would
not arouse suspicion inside the half-mile zone along the border,
which U.S. soldiers cannot enter without authorization.
   After abandoning the vehicle near the border, Peri said he
climbed over the border fence, using angled support posts as a
ladder, according to Stars and Stripes. Peri said he walked to an
East German border command tower and was spotted by soldiers who
took him to a nearby barracks.
   ``They were surprised when I told them how I came over and got so
far before being seen,'' the Stars and Stripes quoted him as saying.
   He was then taken by unidentified civilians to a house in East
Belrin, where he was questioned about the secret documents he
brought on the computer software, Peri told the court, according to
the paper.
   Peri told the judge he didn't realize how extensive the
information was until he returned to Fulda and was questioned by
U.S. intelligence officials, the newspaper said.
   On March 3, Peri told the East Germans he wanted to leave and was
allowed to go back with the computer and the software, the Stars and
Stripes said.
   He was charged with espionage on March 16.
   Peri's parents, Fred and Winnie, and sister, Desiree, from Orange
County, Calif., were at Wednesday' court session, Stars and Stripes
said.

<HEAD>Tourists for Bicentennial Find There's No Room at the Auberge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists coming for the bicentennial of the French
Revolution next month may find out that they picked the worst of
times.
   They will have to stay in a hotel far from the capital. A parking
space in Paris might be just as tough to get.
   Motorcades for the 30 or so presidents and prime ministers will
whiz through streets, and authorities will deploy 30,000 police _
two-thirds from out of town _ during the July 11-17 peak of
festivities.
   Tourists flock to Paris every summer, but officials say the
number of visitors already is considerably larger than last year.
During the bicentennial period, about 3 million tourists are
expected to flood this city of 2.3 million people.
   With a bit of luck, a tourist can still find a room this month.
Next month _ forget it.
   ``Impossible,'' says a woman at the hotel reservations counter of
the Tourist Office on the Champs-Elysees. ``You'll have to go at
least 100 kilometers (60 miles) outside of Paris. Paris is booked
solid.''
   Many VIPs will be attending a July 14-16 summit of the seven
major industrial nations, and their entourages will fill hundreds of
hotel rooms.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is coming to town July 4-6, followed by
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines. Also attending celebrations are
10 African presidents, six North and South American presidents, six
Asian presidents, and six prime ministers or presidents from Western
Europe, with baggage. Among those attending is President Bush.
   The elaborate preparations for the foreign leaders have left many
people grumbling.
   ``Allowing a few dozen privileged people to be lodged and to move
about tranquilly must not in any way be done to the detriment of
hundreds of thousands of other people,'' elected officials from the
Greens Party wrote to President Francois Mitterrand.
   Police have put together a security and traffic strategy worthy
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   For the crucial week of July 10-17, parts of central Paris will
be off- limits to all motor vehicle traffic and no cars allowed to
park on the streets. All vehicles must be removed from those areas.
Permits must be sought for delivery trucks and residents heading for
garages. Taxis may carry passengers into the areas.
   Special parking lots are being set up in the Bois de Vincennes
and Bois de Boulogne, forests on the east and west extremities of
Paris. That could seriously upset the thriving transvestite
prostitution business in the woods.
   Officials have played down the inconvenience.
   ``At least once in our lifetime, we will have seen the heart of
Paris without cars, without trucks, without exhaust fumes, without
backfiring motors,'' said Premier Michel Rocard.
   The Louvre will be shut down July 13-15 for security reasons
while delegations gather at the art museum for sessions.
   And the ``bateaux mouches,'' the tourist boats that ply the
Seine, will drop anchor those three days because they will not be
allowed to use their Alma bridge terminal.
   July 14 is Bastille Day, the 200th anniversary of the storming of
Bastille Prison that started the revolution.
   The Tourist Office said about 100 families have responded so far
to calls for private citizens to rent rooms to visitors.
   ``And we certainly will have more,'' says Florence Quercia,
director of the Champs-Elysees office. ``If you have any problems,
come and see us.''

<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old American nun was
shot in the head and critically wounded by an assailant who fired
into a truck carrying her and two other nuns, the woman's priest and
a co-worker said today.
   Sister Mary MacKey was shot Wednesday night as she was traveling
from the capital to Zaragoza, 10 miles to the south, Father Ken
Myers and Sister Ana Maria Brangan told reporters at the Policlinica
Hospital in San Salvador.
   Sister Brangan was driving the pickup truck carrying Sister
MacKey and another nun of the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate
Word, an order based in Houston, Texas.
   Sister Brangan said a yellow pickup truck carrying at least six
men _ four of them in the back of the truck _ pulled alongside their
vehicle.
   ``They stayed alongside and pulled closer, and I didn't
understand what was going on. Then I heard a noise and thought they
had bumped us. I didn't realize it was a bullet,'' she said.
   The single shot broke the side window and entered Sister MacKey's
skull at the left temple.
   The identities of the attackers were not known.
   Earlier, hospital sources said Sister MacKey was in serious
condition after being operated on Wednesday night. Myers and Sister
Brangan described her condition as critical.
   The nuns work with Myers at a home for war orphans in Zaragoza.
Sister MacKey, a native of Ireland and naturalized U.S. citizen, is
a registered nurse and in charge of the clinic at the Zaragoza
orphanage.
   Some Salvadoran armed forces officers consider nuns, priests and
other church people who work in poor communities sympathizers of
leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government in the
9-year-old civil war.
   In December 1980, four U.S. churchwomen _ three nuns and one lay
worker _ were killed by National Guard troops in El Salvador. The
case led to a temporary suspension of U.S. aid to this country.
   Five National Guardsmen were convicted of the murders in 1984 and
sentenced to 30 years in prison. The men said the church workers
were ``subversives.''
   Myers founded the Zaragoza orphanage, the Oscar Arnulfo Romero
Community, in 1980, and the nuns were headed there when the attack
occurred. The orphanage is named after the Salvadoran archbishop
murdered in March 1980.
   Myers said neither he nor the sisters had received threats, and
he said the crime did not appear to have been politically motivated.
   ``There were at least six men in the truck, and only one
weapon,'' he said. ``They may have been thieves. Maybe they were
drunk.''
   Sister Brangan said she and her two companions had stopped at the
bank before heading for Zaragoza. She said the other nun in their
vehicle, Sister Juana Flores, saw a man standing in the back of the
yellow pickup fire the single shot.
   Sister Brangan said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped and
that the yellow pickup stopped up ahead of her vehicle. When she
began driving again, the assailant's car sped away.
   Myers said Policlinica doctors attending Sister MacKey believe
she will survive. He said if she survives she will lose her left
eye. If she stabilizes enough, she will probably be flown to Houston
for further treatment, he said.

<HEAD>Ex-Hostage Talks of His Imprisonment in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former hostage said Thursday he
sweltered in 111-degree heat in a sealed room during part of his
13-month captivity in Lebanon and kept track of time by reading the
expiration date on yogurt containers.
   When a guard told Jan Cools to leave his tiny cell on June 14, he
thought: ``They are going to shoot me.''
   Despite his ordeal, the 32-year-old Belgian doctor told a news
conference one week after his release that he was ready to return to
Lebanon if his safety was guaranteed.
   ``I have seen so much misery and distress that hundreds of
doctors could work for hundreds of years to help,'' he said of the
conditions in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps, where he worked
before his kidnap.
   Cools, a member of the Marxist relief group Medicine for the
People, read a statement on his ordeal to reporters but declined to
answer questions, saying he was still too tired.
   His statement shed no light on the identity of his kidnappers.
The Soldiers of Justice, a pro-Iran fundamentalist group in Beirut,
claimed it kidnapped him near the southern Lebanon city of Tyre on
May 21, 1988 and held him for 13 months.
   Cools said he never knew for how long he would be held until the
tiny window of his cell swung open on June 14, and a guard told him:
``Get up.''
   Cools said his first reaction was: ``They are going to shoot me.''
   ``But it was soon clear it meant my release. It is a moment I
will never forget in my life.''
   He was freed one day later, after intervention by a Belgian
government minister. He rested several days in Greece and arrived in
Brussels on a Belgian military plane Sunday. Belgian officials have
said no ransom was paid.
   In his statement, Cools spoke of his capture, his insecurity
about his fate and the plight of his parents and friends.
   He was kept in a room so small he could barely stand or stretch,
but for the first six months, guards were friendly and food was good
and plentiful.
   ``I had to watch out that I did not get any fatter,'' Cools said.
   After five days, he was even given a radio. He said temperatures
in his cell reached 111 degrees at times and that guards
occasionally fanned him with a tray to cool him off.
   But in November, the conditions of his imprisonment worsened for
no apparent reason.
   Guards took his radio and watch. All openings in the wall of his
room were sealed in December, making it impossible to tell night
from day.
   ``I started to cry,'' Cools said.
   Cools said he was allowed only 10 showers in eight months. His
hands would get so greasy he could no longer button his shirt, he
said.
   He said he tried to keep time by listening to barking dogs at
night, or looking at the expiration date on the containers of yogurt
he was given.
   He knew it was the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting in the
Moslem year, when guards offered him the traditional sweets.
   ``I sometimes was very desperate, but I never lost confidence in
a happy ending.''
   What kept him going was the belief ``that I came to help
people,'' in Lebanon, Cools said.
   ``I made no mistake. (The abductors), in fact made a mistake.''
   Cools was released after a meeting between Belgian Trade Minister
Robert Urbain and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in Tripoli last week.
   Urbain then left for Syria and Lebanon, where Cools was handed
over to him.
   Urbain said the release was obtained ``without giving back
anything, without compromise.''
   Fourteen foreigners are believed held hostage in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.

   A private research and education organization
urged routine cholesterol testing in children Thursday, saying high
levels go undetected in many youngsters.
   Cholesterol should be checked at some point from ages 2 to 10
``and the sooner the better,'' said Ernst Wynder, president of the
American Health Foundation in New York.
   High cholesterol can lead to disease in the arteries that feed
the heart muscle. That sets the stage for a heart attack in adult
life.
   The American Heart Association recommends childhood cholesterol
testing only if a child's family history suggests he is at risk.
   But that strategy overlooks many children with high cholesterol,
Wynder said in a recent interview. Children are considered at risk
if their fathers have had a heart attack, for example, but a young
father may not have had his heart attack while the child is still
young, Wynder said.
   The health foundation said research shows that some 5 percent to
15 percent of children in industrialized countries have excessive
cholesterol levels, using the adult standard of 200 milligrams per
deciliter or more. Almost a third are above 175 milligrams per
deciliter, which may be a more appropriate marker for children, the
foundation said.
   Wynder said screening all children would be cost-effective
because it would reduce such later costs as those of coronary bypass
operations and time off work from heart attacks.
   The heart association's recommendation was published in 1986.
William Weidman, a member of the committee that developed it, said
it was based on the state of cholesterol-testing technology and
knowledge about childhood cholesterol at that time.
   ``We felt we weren't ready'' for universal childhood screening,
he said in a recent interview.
   Now such screening is being studied by a committee organized by
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Weidman said.
   The heart association is awaiting the committee's conclusions
before deciding on any change in its recommendation, said
association spokesman Howard Lewis.
   The health foundation said a feasible target for children's
cholesterol is 140 milligrams per deciliter. Weidman agreed that is
``a goal to shoot for'' but said diet and exercise will not be
enough to reach it in all children. So medications may be needed, he
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Coast Guard Sailing Ship Arrives in Leningrad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Eagle, the U.S. Coast Guard's three-masted
ship, sailed into Leningrad on Thursday, bringing 300 American
sailors to the former imperial Russian capital at the time of its
``White Nights.''
   It was the first port call of an American warship to a Soviet
city since 1975, said Capt. Peter Huchthausen, the U.S. naval
attache in Moscow.
   The picturesque Eagle doesn't carry any weapons, even though it's
called a warship. Instead, it sails with a crew of 55 and 250 Coast
Guard Academy cadets _ would-be officers learning their seamanship
skills on an annual summer training cruise, Huchthausen said.
   For three days, the cadets will see Leningrad in the midst of the
``White Nights,'' when most of the population spills out onto Nevsky
Prospect and other avenues in a vast street party. It is a time when
the sun just barely sets and the skies never completely darken over
the northern city.
   The Coast Guard Academy band joined the festivities and gave a
concert Wednesday night outside the Kazan Cathedral in downtown
Leningrad, according to the U.S. Consulate. The Eagle, a sailing
barque built in the 1930s, will be open to Soviets for tours Friday
and Saturday.
   Americans will have a similar chance to explore off-limits
territory in July, when a Soviet missile cruiser, destroyer and
tanker sail into Norfork, Va., Huchthausen said.
   Other U.S. warships are scheduled to visit Sevastopol on the
Black Sea in August.

   The Bush administration wants to stress U.S.
outrage over China's crackdown on the democracy movement without
pressing that nation to the point where ``its only real prospect for
reaching out to the world is back toward the Soviet Union,'' Richard
H. Solomon said Thursday.
   Solomon, President Bush's nominee for assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that ``only China can
answer the question whether it can now return to the path of
reform.''
   Solomon, who heads the State Department's policy planning staff,
appeared at an Asian policy conference sponsored by the Heritage
Foundation, a private research organization.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, another speaker, described China
as a ``tragedy of old men holding onto power by executing their own
grandchildren.'' He added that ``I hope I'm wrong but I believe our
relations with China are going to get worse for a long time.''
   Murkowski said that a new leadership in Beijing ``would give
everybody the opportunity for a way out'' of the current situation.
   Solomon said that prospects of continued openness and stability
in China ``are now clouded by repression and possibly turning inward
if not returning to centralized management.''
   He said U.S. policy-makers face a challenge of balancing ``the
totally appropriate outrage our people feel about the violent
massacre inflicted on peaceful Chinese demonstrators'' with the
desirability of not pushing China into Moscow's arms.
   Solomon said that the policy-makers want to express that outrage
without pushing China ``into a situation where its only real
prospect of reaching out to the world is back toward the Soviet
Union.''
   He said another challenge of U.S. Asian policy is to ``better
manage'' relations with Japan, which form ``the keystone of our
dealings in the Pacific,'' and preventing trade and technology
disputes from undermining them.
   Solomon said the administration does not favor a free trade
arrangement with Japan that would exclude other Pacific countries
but seeks a regional consensus on ``some form of appropriate
mutilateral mechanism'' to deal with trade, financial, technological
and environmental issues.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will unveil such proposals
in a New York speech Monday and during an Asian tour, Solomon said.
   He also said the administration is ``gearing up for a major
diplomatic effort'' for a peace process in Cambodia that will spare
the Cambodians from a new civil war and allow them to choose their
own government after the expected end of the Vietnamese occupation
later this year.
   Solomon said the United States also needs to ``reaffirm the
consensus which has been underpinning security'' since World War II
in Asia and the Pacific.
   He said the situation in Korea ``remains highly explosive''
because North Korean leaders are not undertaking the kind of reforms
``we see in much of the communist world.''

   With the minds of engineers and the
spirits of pioneers, 18 teams are gambling their reputations and
their survival in the first human-powered submarine races.
   ``There's both a fun and serious side to the races,'' said Maggie
Linskey Merrill, director of The H.A. Perry Foundation Inc., a
Hingham, Mass.-based undersea research group that, along with
Florida Atlantic University of Boca Raton, organized the three-day
event starting Friday.
   ``We want to see the type of materials used and what shape
performs the best,'' Ms. Merrill said. ``There could be a commercial
and recreational application for human-powered subs.''
   And for the competitors, who will race their two-person craft
1,000 feet offshore in about 20 feet of water, there's the spice of
a $5,000 overall performance prize and several smaller cash awards
for design and efficiency.
   The lightweight subs _ with one person steering and the other in
the ``crankman'' seat providing the pedal power _ will race
head-to-head over a one-kilometer course. The eight winners of
Friday's first rounds will move on to elimination rounds over the
weekend. The subs will tow surface floats to mark their progress,
about the pace of a brisk walk.
   All the subs are ``wet'' designs that fill up with water and
require the crews to wear scuba gear.
   For most entrants, the nearly 18 months of design and
construction was plotted on computers and bankrolled by universities
or corporate sponsors. A few, however, pulled the car out of the
family garage for their work space.
   Ed Leibolt and two co-workers at the David Taylor Research Center
in Bethesda, Md., combed junk yards for parts. The crew seats are
old plastic cafeteria chairs, and an old 10-speed bike was converted
into the sub's gear system.
   They dubbed the 600-pound fiberglass sub ``The Turtle'' after the
first human-powered sub, built in 1775 but abandoned after its first
unsuccessful mission to sink British ships in New York Harbor.
   ``Hope we have better luck,'' said Leibolt. ``We literally funded
this by passing around a hat in the office.''
   In Concord, Calif., an auto shop donated a pink-and-green paint
job for the independent ``Sub-Human.''
   ``We sort of winged it,'' said crankman Chris Reno, who still
shivers when he recalls the first test run in 46-degree Lake Tahoe.
   While most of the subs resemble sleek torpedos, many teams
boasted of subtle differences.
   ``Ours may look like some of the others, but there's one
difference: Ours is fastest,'' said Paul Friedman, a back-up
navigator for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
``Icarus,'' which uses a cable-and-pulley propulsion system rather
than the more common chain-and-gear.
   ``We designed ours in a perfect hydrodynamic shape,'' said
University of Washington mechanical engineering graduate George
Poor. ``It should slice right through the water.''
   The ``Gossamer Albacor,'' built by Lockheed Advanced Marine
Systems in San Diego, was one of two entries using a waving
fish-tail propulsion device rather than propellers.
   ``We're looking at all things: the cleverness of design and the
materials used,'' said engineer Robert Phillips, one of six judges
assigned to award $500 prizes for cost effectiveness and innovation.
``Anyone can build something with a blank check. I'll be looking for
some real imagination.''
   Surely, 73-year-old Calvin Gongwer's ``Knuckle Ball'' will not go
unnoticed.
   Gongwer, president of Innerspace Corp., of Covina, Calif., will
be the navigator inside his 60-inch-diameter plastic sphere.
   ``There are some ideas I want to test out with spheres
underwater,'' said Gongwer. ``Looks aren't everything.''
   On the beach, Perry Foundation President H.A. Perry watched all
the preparations.
   ``The response has been four of five times what we imagined,''
said Perry. ``At first we thought we'd have a few subs, a few races
and a keg of beer. We didn't expect this.''

   A fire burned deep within the nation's biggest
gold mine for a second day today as firefighters prepared to pump in
sand and water.
   No injuries were reported, and the fire posed no danger to the
mine itself, said Homestake Mining Co. spokesman Scott Zieske.
   The fire, burning in old timbers in an isolated area 3,500 feet
down, forced the evacuation of more than 400 miners Wednesday and
the cancellation of the day shift for more than 300 miners today,
Zieske said.
   ``Our job now is to seal off the bottom on the 3,500-foot level
and to pump in sand from the top, a sand and water mix to smother
the flames,'' he said.
   The cause of the fire was not known.
   Homestake, the nation's largest gold producer, has been operating
in South Dakota since 1877. A 1982 fire at the 6,050-foot level of
the 8,000-foot-deep mine caused no injuries but $500,000 in losses.
The cause never was determined.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today called upon all American
citizens and institutions to join a voluntary crusade to fight
poverty, drugs and other societal ills by extending national service
``into every corner of America.''
   Bringing a campaign metaphor to life, he unveiled his blueprint
for a foundation called the ``Points of Light Initiative'' that
would get $25 million a year in taxpayers' funds to spur Americans
to volunteer for social service.
   He made the pitch in a speech for the New York City Partnership,
a civic group, after touring a shelter for runaway youth called
Covenant House.
   Bush also named New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean to head an advisory
committee that will recommend legislation to achieve the
foundation's goals and propose a structure for the organization.
   ``I ask all Americans and all American institutions, large and
small, to make service central to your life and work,'' Bush said.
   ``We know that during the past two decades we have spent more
money, on more social programs, than at any time in our history. And
some problems aren't better. In fact, they're worse.''
   Bush said ``too many Americans still endure a living nightmare of
want and isolation. That must stop.''
   ``The key to constructive change is building relationships, not
bureaucracies,' he said.
   ``Today, more than ever, we need community service to help
drop-outs, pregnant teens and drug abusers; the homeless and AIDS
victim; the hungry and illiterate.''
   Invoking again the guiding metaphor of his campaign, Bush said he
wanted to unleash the energy of every citizen, school, business,
church and synagogue and civic group.
   ``This is what I mean when I talk of `a thousand points of light'
_ that vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to
solve problems in their own back yard,'' he said.
   Bush said he was asking both the public and private sector,
including all branches of government, to ``join this great movement
to extend national service into every corner of America.''
   He urged every church and synagogue to ``become an
around-the-clock community center,'' every restaurant and grocery to
distribute surplus food to soup kitchens and shelters, every
corporation to teach illiterate employees to read, and every college
to start a Big Brother or Big Sister program.
   Bush said that in addition to the Youth Engaged in Service to
America program (YES) announced Wednesday, the new foundation will
include a ``ServNet Project'' that will encourage corporations,
professional firms and other groups to donate the services of their
top talent.
   Bush said the YES program will select annually two college-age
youth from each state to serve as roving service ambassadors and
salespeople. ``We know that volunteerism can help those free-falling
through society,'' Bush said.
   At Covenant House, a shelter near Times Square, Bush and his wife
Barbara heard 11 young residents tell of their lives on the streets.
Mrs. Bush cradled a three-week-old baby of one of the youths as they
spoke.
   Monique, 20, said of her life on the streets, ``You don't want to
be there.'' She said as a child she was beaten at home, ``tied up
and hung over a spiral staircase.''
   Walter, 18, told the president that kids wound up on the streets
because ``It's hard to get good jobs. Working in McDonald's at the
minimum wage _ it just doesn't pay.''
   He said that he could make $100 ``in 15 minutes'' selling drugs.
He said his father was an alcoholic and his mother was dead.
   The White House billed the new community service drive as a
potential panacea for a welter of social problems, from drug abuse
to homelessness, and said it could be `the most comprehensive and
inclusive movement of our time.''
   During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last
Aug. 18 Bush first spoke of what he called the ``brilliant
diversity'' of volunteerism in America, shining ``like a thousand
points of light'' across society.
   The metaphor drew guffaws from Democratic rival Michael Dukakis,
but Bush returned to the theme repeatedly and promised to help spur
volunteerism with a Youth Entering Service to America initiative.

   Margaret Chase Smith was sent 91 dozen
roses in appreciation for her efforts to make the rose America's
national flower.
   The former U.S. senator, who is 91, accepted the gigantic bouquet
Wednesday. Most of the roses will be given to nursing homes and a
hospital.
   Mrs. Smith said she had campaigned ``for 40 years plus'' in
Washington to make the rose the national flower. It became known as
her trademark.
   ``I always got it passed in the House, but never the Senate,''
she said. Finally winning approval in both chambers, the bill was
signed into law in 1987.
   The long-stemmed ``Samantha'' red roses, arranged in a single
vase, took on the appearance of a 7-foot Christmas tree being
transported through the streets of Mrs. Smith's home town of
Skowhegan on an open, flat-bed trailor.
   A radio station and a florists' group presented the giant bouquet.

   The horde of squealing youngsters knew how to
get to Sesame Street on Thursday: Follow the yellow bird, just as
millions of kids have done watching television for the last two
decades.
   The Smithsonian Institution saluted the 20th anniversary of the
popular public television show with lavish oratory at the ceremonial
opening of a ``Sesame Street'' exhibition at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of American History.
   Visiting preschoolers swarmed past grown-up dignitaries and TV
cameramen to jostle happily around Mr. Hooper's storefront.
   At the window ledge was Elmo, their old Muppet friend. The
friendly, red-faced animal, operated by puppeteer Kevin Clash, waved
back and spoke to the youngsters who reached out to grasp his paws.
   The children giggled at Oscar the Grouch, scowling from his trash
can, and peered up at the 8-foot-2-inch yellow majesty of Big Bird.
Along the lower walls of the museum, they twirled clear plastic
wheels to form funny faces and searched a train picture to count the
hidden letter T's.
   ``The one thing kids won't learn on `Sesame Street' is the
difference between education and fun,'' said Ellen Roney Hughes, the
exhibition curator.
   ``Sesame Street,'' created by Joan Ganz Cooney's non-profit
Children's Television Workshop to help disadvantaged children age 3
to 5 make the transition from home to school, made its public
television debut Nov. 10, 1969.
   In the last two decades, the hour-long show has won 36 Emmys and
is seen regularly in more than 11 million households each week. The
English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries.
   Producer David V.B. Britt estimated the show has 40 million
``graduates,'' not counting tens of millions of parents who also
watch.
   Britt was accompanied by Loretta Long, the actress who has played
Susan the nurse on ``Sesame Street'' since it began. Long is a
professional educator with a Ph.D. in urban education.
   Museum director Roger G. Kennedy said the show's creators had
prevailed against ``the greed, heedlessness and irresponsibility of
much of network television'' to produce a program that has ``made an
immense difference in the tone of our culture.''
   ``It is not only a TV program, it's a proclamation that there are
people, even in the TV industry, who aren't going to give up on it,
they're staying with it and producing something that is good,''
Kennedy said. ``That's heroism.''
   The exhibition includes more than 50 photographs recalling two
decades of ``Sesame Street'' programming.
   Besides the show's familiar Muppet characters, objects on display
include the Sesame Street lamp post and sign, original story boards
and a production slate used in filming.
   When the exhibition closes at summer's end, Oscar will join the
museum's permanent history of American entertainment collection,
alongside Judy Garland's ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,''
Larry Hagman's cowboy hat from TV's ``Dallas'' and Archie Bunker's
wing chair from ``All In The Family.''
   For the record, Big Bird likes birdseed sandwiches, while Oscar's
favorite treat is an ice cream sundae topped with pickles and
sardines.

<HEAD>Illinois Congressman Faints on House Floor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., fainted in a chair
on the House floor today, but the lawmaker's press secretary said he
recovered quickly and did not appear to have suffered any serious
illness.
   The 79-year-old, 20-term congressman from Chicago became dizzy
and fainted for about a minute during a House session.
   Six members of the medical staff that serves Congress placed a
blood pressure cuff on his left arm and what appeared to be a heart
monitor on his chest. They talked to him for about 15 minutes before
wheeling him out of the chamber in a wheelchair.
   ``I feel fine,'' Yates said as he left.
   Press secretary Mary Bain said Yates was soon cracking jokes with
the medical staff and was taken to the attending physician's office
in the Capitol for further examination.
   She said they would probably to an electrocardiogram, but ``there
was no indication he had a heart attack.''
   ``He's been overworking like the devil,'' Ms. Bain said, and
probably was just tired. Yates chairs the House Appropriations
subcommittee on Interior and related agencies.
   House members, who were making one-minute speeches on the subject
of their choice, continued their business as the emergency crew
worked on Yates.
   Several dozen members were present, most of them speaking out
against the Supreme Court decision Wednesday that allowed burning of
the American flag as a means of protest.

<HEAD>Dog Lost On Mount McKinley Wanders Into Camp 18 Days Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sled dog lost in poor weather during a
climbing expedition on Mount McKinley has turned up, weak but alive,
after 18 days on the ice-covered mountain.
   Patricia and Jean-Francois Tuveri of Chamonix, France, assumed
the dog had fallen in a crevasse and died after it disappeared May
31.
   The Tuveris had four dogs in harness when they started mushing up
North America's tallest peak. On the sixth day of the journey, while
descending to their camp at the 11,000-foot level after ferrying
supplies higher, they unhitched the dogs because of treacherous ice
conditions.
   By the time they got around Windy Corner at 13,200 feet, only
three dogs were with them. A 15-month-old Siberian husky named
Oukiok was gone.
   A snowstorm forced the Tuveris to hole up for the next four days.
When they climbed to a medical research camp at 14,200 feet, they
asked other climbers if they had seen the dog. None had and they
assumed he had fallen to his death.
   With only three dogs left, the Tuveris abandoned their sled and
simply climbed to the 20,320-foot summit with the dogs. It was only
the second expedition to reach the top with dogs.
   The Tuveris left the mountain for some sightseeing around Alaska,
then returned to Talkeetna, near the mountain, to pick up the
remaining dogs for the trip back to France.
   That's where they learned that, 18 days after he disappeared,
Oukiok had walked into the high basin where the medical camp is
located. Denali National Park rangers said the dog didn't have any
broken bones, but was exhausted.
   ``It would seem pretty spectacular but it's not impossible,''
said Jim Leach, chief veterinarian for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race. Snow and ice could provide enough liquid to prevent death
through dehydration, he said.
   The dog was being nursed back to health by staff members at the
research camp. Rangers said he should soon have enough strength to
make the trip to the Kahiltna Glacier base camp at 7,200 feet. From
there he will be flown to Talkeetna, hopefully in time to accompany
the Tuveris and the other three dogs back to France on Monday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today declared that, while he
would support the Supreme Court decision backing the right of
protesters to burn the American flag, ``flag burning is wrong _ dead
wrong.''
   ``The flag of the United States is very, very special,'' Bush
said, departing from the text of a speech on volunteerism to the New
York Partnership, a civic group.
   The president made the flag a major focus of his 1988
presidential campaign, even giving a stump speech outside a New
Jersey flag factory. He repeatedly attacked Democratic opponent
Michael Dukakis for having vetoed as governor of Massachusetts a
proposed state law requiring recitation of the pledge of allegiance
in schools.
   In a 5-4 ruling Wednesday, the Supreme Court restricted the power
of states to punish those who burn or otherwise desecrate an
American flag.
   ``I understand the legal basis for that decision. And I respect
the Supreme Court and as president of the United States, I will see
that the law of the land is fully supported,'' Bush said.
   ``But I have to give you my personal, emotional response. Flag
burning is wrong _ dead wrong.''
   Bush's comments were greeted by rousing applause from his
audience.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Emergency at Angola Penitentiary Because of Escapes,
Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has declared an emergency
at the state penitentiary at Angola in the wake of 11 escapes, four
fatal stabbings and four suicides in 14 months.
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola, in an order signed Wednesday,
appointed Ross Maggio Jr., a former warden, to oversee an
investigation. Polozola ordered U.S. Attorney Ray Lamonica to
conduct any necessary criminal or civil investigations.
   The judge noted that the 11 prisoners who escaped since April
1988 were serving long-term sentences for serious crimes, including
murder, rape and kidnapping. Ten have been captured.
   ``While the court understands escapes will occur in a prison, it
appears escapes at the Louisiana State Penitentiary are occurring on
a more frequent basis and are beginning to affect the lives and
property of the general public,'' Polozola wrote.
   The judge said some prison deaths apparently resulted from drugs
and weapons being smuggled into the prison, where the weapons were
used to retaliate against those who failed to pay for the drugs.
   Warden Hilton Butler said he has a good record of keeping
violence at Angola to a minimum, noting there have been only three
murders this year.
   ``There were three murders in one night under Maggio,'' Butler
said. ``When everything is dug out, you'll find out my record is
better than the man who's investigating me.''
   ``I think the judge is sincere, but he's getting bad
information,'' Butler said.
   Corrections Secretary Bruce Lynn said Wednesday he and Gov. Buddy
Roemer met with Polozola several weeks ago and again last week to
discuss the prison.
   Roemer approved of the appointment of Maggio, an aide said.
   Maggio, 50, was warden in 1976 and 1977 and from 1981 to 1984. He
said by telephone from his home in Florida that he would resign from
his job with a private security company there and move back to Baton
Rouge.

<TEXT>
   In at least one respect, Paul Schlichtman's
lawsuit is just a token gesture. He'll be happy if it nets him
$20.35.
   The commuter is suing the New Jersey Highway Authority because
its discount toll-booth tokens were always sold out, and when he did
manage to buy some, they sold him a slug. That's what the 35 cents
in the suit is for.
   By the same token, he'll also seek the $11.70 court filing fee.
   ``If you've got a mule, the only way you can get it to do
something is to get its attention first,'' he said Wednesday. ``I'm
filing the suit to get their attention, then I'm going to get them
to do something _ give me the money they owe me.''
   Schlichtman said he tried five times without success to buy rolls
of tokens for the Garden State Parkway. It costs $10 to buy 40
tokens, a savings of $4 over the cash toll.
   ``I spend about $1,000 a year on tolls, counting going into New
York,'' said Schlichtman, a South Orange resident who works in New
York City giving driving lessons to cabbies. ``I spend more time
sitting at toll booths than I do with any other part of my day.
They're ridiculous and obnoxious.''
   Schlichtman said a toll collector refused to reimburse him for
the slug.
   New Jersey Highway Authority spokesman Dennis Ingoglia would not
comment on the case but said if motorists are sold slugs, they can
contact the agency for reimbursement.

<HEAD>Economy Expanded at 4.4 Percent Annual Rate in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy expanded at a 4.4 percent
annual rate in the first three months of the year, but the overall
growth rate masked a significant slowdown in business activity, the
government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
country's total output of goods and services, rose at the fastest
rate in more than a year during the first quarter.
   However, more than half of the increase resulted from a
statistical rebound from last year's drought, a one-time accounting
change necessary to return expected farm production this year to its
pre-drought levels.
   Discounting this change, the non-farm economy grew at a
lackluster annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first quarter, down
from a non-farm growth rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months
of 1988.
   Economists have been predicting for some time that economic
growth will slow markedly this year under the impact of high
interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve in an effort to
cool off inflationary pressures.
   On the inflation front, a price index tied to the GNP rose at an
annual rate of 4.6 percent in the first three months of the year, a
less worrisome figure than a 5 percent increase estimated a month
ago. The improvement came from slower price increases for farm
products and industrial supplies.
   The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion
report that showed the after-tax profits of American corporations
fell by 1.1 percent in the first three months of 1989. The decline,
which was revised from an even larger 1.7 percent estimated drop a
month ago, was the first setback for corporate profits since a 2.5
percent fall in the first quarter of 1987.
   Economists said the new GNP report was a generally favorable sign
that the Fed can engineer a soft-landing with slower growth and less
inflation without pushing the country into a recession.
   ``The Federal Reserve seems to be getting precisely what it asked
for,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co.
of Chicago. ``We have an economy that is continuing to expand but at
a subdued rate.''
   Many analysts believe that the country has now entered what is
termed a growth recession, a period when the economy keeps growing
but at such a sluggish pace that unemployment rises.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., predicted that the unemployment rate, now at 5.2
percent, would climb to 5.9 percent early next year.
   She forecast GNP growth in the second quarter of around 1.8
percent, very much like the non-farm increase in the first three
months of the year. In the second half of 1989, she predicted growth
would slow to around 1 percent, but without a recession.
   ``It is still our bet that we can avoid a recession,'' she said.
``The new GNP report provides further ammunition for those arguing
for a soft landing.''
   The primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall
4.4 percent GNP figure, up from a 4.3 percent estimate a month ago,
was a better performance in trade than previously believed.
   The country's huge trade deficit, which had been getting worse
since last spring, narrowed significantly in the first quarter and
business investment shot up substantially.
   The U.S. trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, narrowed by $19.5
billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and
imports fell by 0.5 percent while business investment advanced by
7.6 percent, rebounding from a 2.9 percent decline in the fourth
quarter.
   The Bush administration is counting on both trade and business
investment to be strong this year to keep the economy moving forward
while consumer spending slackens.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, rose at a sluggish annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first
quarter, reflecting in part weak auto sales. Housing construction,
which also has been hard hit by the Fed's anti-inflation campaign,
dropped by 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the poorest performance
in a year.
   The Federal Reserve signaled last week that it had begun lowering
interest rates slightly amid signs that inflationary pressures are
abating somewhat. That move is expected to revive the fortunes of
interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual level of $4.077 trillion in the first quarter.
   The latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the
Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter put the consensus growth
forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down significantly from GNP
growth of 3.9 percent in 1988, the best performance in four years.
   The Bush administration, which needs significant growth to lower
the budget deficit without the need to resort to a tax increase, is
more optimistically forecasting growth this year of 3.2 percent.
That estimate will be revised by mid-July and administration
officials have indicated that they expect to lower their growth
figure somewhat.

<HEAD>Proposals Sought to Search for Water on Moon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private space research organization said
Thursday it has asked for proposals from satellite manufacturers to
build a probe to look for water on parts of the moon that have never
seen daylight.
   Gregg Maryniak, executive vice president of the Space Studies
Institute, said the probe can be built for $5 million, and sent to
the moon in 1992 with a little bit f help from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   For example, he told a news conference, NASA has in storage an
Apollo-era gamma ray spectrometer that could be dusted off and used
to map the moon's surface and search for water at the poles, areas
of which never face the sun.
   NASA or rocket-launching firms could also carry the probe into
orbit as non-paying cargo, either on the space shuttle or as a
hitchhiker on a rocket taking a satellite to an orbit 22,300 miles
above Earth, Maryniak said.
   He said SSI, a 12-year-old organization supported by 4,000
private members, is looking for financing from aerospace
corporations and organizations.
   The six teams of astronauts who visited the moon in the 1969-1972
period all landed closer to the equator of the moon than to the
poles and the question of whether there is water to be found in the
shadowed area never was answered.
   Finding water, which is composed of hydrogen and oxygen _ the
fuel for chemical rockets _ would be of enormous value to future
space exploration. The National Commission on Space recommended such
a search as its first priority. It takes less than one-twentieth the
energy to lift materials form the moon as it does from Earth.

   Baby, you can drive my car, the Beatles said. But
no one took them up on it.
   A psychedelic 1956 Bentley that supposedly was driven around
London by John Lennon in the 1960s was pulled from the auction block
Wednesday after no one bid.
   Before the auction, Christie's had taken the unusual step of
distributing a note that read, ``Christie's has only third-party
confirmation from people other than the surviving Beatles that John
Lennon personally used the car.''
   The car is owned by Biond Fury, a New York psychic, writer and
composer, and Yulla Lipchitz, a photographer.
   Bidding for the Bentley opened at $300,000 and closed when no one
raised a hand, said a Christie's spokeswoman.
   Items that did sell included Herman Mankiewicz's copy of his
Oscar-winning script for Orson Welles' ``Citizen Kane.'' It brought
$231,000, breaking the previous record for a script _ $143,000 for
Welles' radio production ``War of the Worlds'' last fall.
   A copy of ``Gone With the Wind'' autographed by the entire cast
of the movie sold for $13,200, and a copy of the 1930 book ``The New
Wizard of Oz,'' autographed by everyone on the movie, including
Toto, sold for $20,900.

   The man nominated as commissioner of the
Internal Revenue Service told Congress on Thursday that he won't
tolerate harassment of whistle-blowers who point out agency problems.
   ``Privates often know ... a lot more about fighting wars than the
generals,'' Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told the Senate Finance Committee,
which is considering his nomination. ``If they can't feel free to
communicate their perceptions, we will lose touch.''
   Goldberg, who served two years as chief counsel to the IRS, also
condemned illegal leaks of confidential tax information, such as
apparently occurred in the case of former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   While Wright was the subject of an ethics investigation that
eventually led him to resign, news reports quoted unnamed IRS
sources as saying Wright's taxes were being investigated.
   ``The fastest way to lose faith with the American people is to
have them believe we disclose that (confidential) information,''
Goldberg said.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., questioned Goldberg about recent
allegations of IRS wrongdoing, some of which could involve criminal
activity.
   ``Misconduct will not be tolerated in this institution,''
Goldberg said.
   Goldberg praised the new ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights,'' designed to
help taxpayers who run into trouble with the IRS, as ``essential to
sound tax administration.''
   Goldberg, 41, would succeed Lawrence B. Gibbs, who left earlier
this year to resume a private law practice.

   Newly filed documents detail how Ferdinand
Marcos allegedly looted the Philippines, using kickbacks, dummy
corporations and war reparations with Japan to amass $5 billion, a
newspaper reported today.
   The papers were filed Wednesday in federal court to amend a
3-year-old lawsuit brought by the Philippine government, which seeks
$50 billion in damages against the deposed Philippine president and
his wife, Imelda.
   The documents portray the couple as sophisticated schemers who
ran the Philippines as though it were their own personal enterprise,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   The lawsuit accuses the Marcoses of racketeering from 1965 to
1986, illegally transporting stolen money to the United States and
laundering investments through associates and front companies.
   The two were indicted last year in federal court in New York on
similar allegations.
   Marcos was reported in very critical and unstable condition this
morning at St. Francis Medical Center in Honolulu.
   Attorney John J. Bartko of San Francisco, who represents the
couple, was not in his office this morning, a secretary said.
   The documents provide the most complete public description to
date of how the Marcoses amassed their wealth over two decades, said
Ronald L. Olsen. He and Alan D. Bersin head a team of lawyers
representing the Philippine government.
   Listed are bank accounts allegedly controlled by the Marcoses and
their associates in the Philippines, Switzerland, Hong Kong,
Lichtenstein and Great Britain, the Times said.
   The new filings also list dummy firms allegedly used to launder
money, along with others that allegedly diverted millions of dollars
in Philippine government proceeds from sugar, coconut and other
commodity sales.
   The Customs Service in Honolulu is holding millions of dollars in
jewelry and Filipino pesos, and five handguns that the Marcoses are
trying to recover. A federal court case on that matter is pending.
   The lawsuit by the government of President Corazon Aquino is one
of 40 cases pending against the Marcoses in this country and in the
Philippines.
   Besides the Marcoses, the nine defendants in the Los Angeles case
include Saudi Arabian millionaire Adnan Khashoggi who lives in
Switzerland, and Roberto D. Benedicto, a former Marcos associate who
is a federal fugitive from criminal charges in New York stemming
from many of the same allegations outlined in this suit.
   Other defendants are the California Overseas Bank in Los Angeles
and the Redwood Bank in San Francisco, which were allegedly
controlled by Marcos and his associates; and three companies, Krodos
Properties N.V. of the Netherlands Antilles, Al Djebel Corp. of the
Cayman Islands and Lei Investments Ltd. of the Channel Islands.
   Frederick J. Hoey, chief administrative officer of Redwood Bank,
said he had not been served with papers in the case and therefore
would not comment.
   Among other things, the documents accuse the Marcoses of
embezzling Philippine assets and taking kickbacks from companies
doing business in that country.
   One item states that from July 1965 to February 1986 the Marcoses
received $53 million in kickbacks on government contracts negotiated
with seven Japanese citizens as part of a war reparations treaty,
the Times said.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday made it easier
for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts, a decision
free-speech advocates found disquieting.
   The court, by a 6-3 vote, upheld New York City's effort to avoid
ear-splitting noise levels in Central Park by requiring sponsors of
rock concerts to use a sound system operated by a city-designated
engineer.
   Such requirements don't violate the freedom-of-expression
guarantees of the Constitution's First Amendment, the court said.
   But Dana Beal, political coordinator for a concert-sponsoring
organization called Rock Against Racism, said the ruling strikes at
the heart of rock.
   ``Bit by bit, each municipality in the country will be able to
turn rock 'n' roll into easy listening music,'' Beal said.
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that would
have forced city officials to devise a less restrictive way to deal
with what they deem excessively loud entertainment.
   ``This less-restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a
part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place and manner
regulation'' on expression, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the
court.
   ``The city's sound amplification guideline is narrowly tailored
to serve ... substantial and content-neutral governmental
interests,'' he wrote ``Accordingly, it is valid under the First
Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of
expression.''
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the court
``plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the
damage that it does to our First Amendment rights.''
   Marshall called New York's requirement for a city-run sound
system ``an impermissible prior restraint,'' and said such
government actions should be subjected to the same scrutiny as
regulations based on an expression's content.
   ``Judgments that sounds are too loud, noise-like or discordant
can mask disapproval of the music itself,'' he said.
   Quoting one music critic, the 80-year-old Marshall said, ``New
music always sounds loud to old ears.''
   He was joined in dissent by Justices William J. Brennan and John
Paul Stevens.
   The city's noise-control campaign is aimed at protecting visitors
to Central Park's Sheep Meadow, a 13-acre area decreed a ``quiet
zone'' by Mayor Ed Koch in 1985, and residents of fashionable
Central Park West.
   The city policy was challenged by Rock Against Racism, which
sponsors an annual program of speakers and musical groups in the
park's Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell.
   The losing lawyer in the case was William Kunstler, who a day
earlier found himself on the winning side when the justices ruled
that burning the American flag is a form of constitutionally
protected political protest.
   ``What the court gives with one hand it takes away with the
other,'' Kunstler said. ``Now, art is subject to government control,
something the framers of the Constitution certainly would not have
countenanced.''

<TEXT>
   Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti has
``substantial and heavily corroborated evidence'' that Pete Rose bet
on his own team's games, a lawyer for major league baseball told a
judge today.
   The statement by Louis Hoynes Jr. was baseball's first assertion
that it has evidence that could get the Cincinnati Reds manager
banned from baseball for life.
   The Associated Press has learned the evidence includes an
expert's determination that Rose's handwriting is on betting slips
involving Reds games. In addition, a federal law enforcement
official told The New York Times that Rose's fingerprints are on the
slips.
   Rose's lawyers today asked Common Pleas Judge Norbert Nadel for a
temporary restraining order blocking Giamatti's hearing Monday with
Rose in New York to consider the gambling allegations. The lawyers
charge that Giamatti is biased.
   ``There is evidence, substantial and heavily corroborated
evidence, that Mr. Rose bet large sums of money on major league
baseball games and on games of the Cincinnati Reds,'' Hoynes said in
arguing against the request.
   Rose, who did not attend the hearing, has consistently denied
betting on baseball. One of his lawyers, Robert Stachler, argued
today that Rose had been denied a fair investigation by Giamatti.
   Hoynes today asked Nadel to release to the public a 225-page
report by baseball investigator John M. Dowd on the allegations.
Nadel refused.
   Dowd's report includes three ``Pete Rose Betting Sheets''
supplied to investigators by Paul G. Janszen, who claimed to have
run bets for Rose to bookmaker Ronald Peters. Janszen later became
an FBI informant.
   Rose's lawyers revealed the sheets' existence Monday in their
lawsuit and released correspondence that confirms Rose supplied
writing samples at baseball's request. The lawsuit said nothing
about the analyst's conclusions.
   Janszen, who last week completed a six-month sentence in a
halfway house for failing to report income from the sale of
steroids, gave the betting sheets to federal authorities while he
was investigated, a source said.
   He kept a copy, and later supplied that to baseball's
investigators when they started looking into Rose's alleged
gambling, the source said.
   ``Rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries,'' a federal law
enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the
Times. ``He says he didn't write them, but we're as confident as we
could be that he did.''
   Rose, speaking Wednesday night after the Reds lost a doubleheader
to the Braves at Atlanta, was informed of the reports on the
handwriting and fingerprints.
   ``That's not true,'' he said before declining to comment further.
   Rose also is being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Cincinnati that is examining his taxes.
   Reuven J. Katz, one of Rose's five lawyers, declined to comment
when asked about the betting slips.
   Rich Levin, a spokesman for Giamatti, also declined to comment.
   In the suit, Rose's lawyers allege that Janszen stole three
pieces of paper from the home of the Reds manager.
   Robert A. Pitcairn Jr., another Rose lawyer, suggested in a May
12 letter to Dowd that Janszen might have forged the sheets.
   ``Janszen is quite clever and has access to Mr. Rose's
signature,'' Pitcairn wrote. ``In fact, we understand that Mr. Rose
has signed blank pieces of paper for Janszen to use in connection
with certificates of authenticity for various items. Janszen is not
above transposing writing from one sheet to another or creating
documents that would appear authentic.''

   China executed seven more people Thursday for

   The executions continued despite mounting international
condemnation of the government's crackdown on internal dissent.
   The seven put to death by the state had been convicted of burning
military vehicles when the army marched into Beijing on June 3-4 and
drove thousands of demonstrators out of Tiananmen Square.
   A poster board outside the Beijing high court was filled with
small arrest notices, and those involving the condemned said they
ranged in age from 18 to 33. There was a large red check, indicating
execution, on each of the notices with the word ``proclaimed.''
Soldiers later tore the notices off the board.
   So far, 27 people have been put to death: the seven in Beijing,
and on Wednesday three in Shanghai and 17 in Jinan.
   The Shanghai residents were condemned of leading an angry mob
that burned a train on June 6 after it smashed through a barricade
set up by protesters, killing six people.
   The 17 in the northeastern city of Jinan were among 45 people
convicted at a public rally of 10,000 of ``seriously endangering
public order.'' A local reporter said they were common criminals not
associated with the student movement, but a radio broadcast said
they had taken part in disturbances in Shandong province.
   Jinan, like many other Chinese cities, was rocked by
demonstrations and riots after the military crackdown ended seven
weeks of protests in Beijing.
   Police since have arrested more than 1,600 nationwide for
participating in what the government calls the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Many nations, including the United States, appealed to China for
clemency for the condemned, and denounced the executions when the
government carried them out.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said Thursday it was
``unwise and futile'' for other countries to try to dictate how
China should handle its domestic turmoil.
   China hopes to maintain relations with the United Stats, but ``we
firmly oppose the American government interfering in China's
internal affairs and exerting pressure on China,'' Li said at a
weekly press briefing.
   The Bush administration has cut off military sales and top-level
contacts to protest China's suppression of the pro-democracy
movement.
   In announcing the arrests of the 13 people charged with spying
for Taiwan, national television news showed secretly filmed scenes
of the accused mixing with demonstrators and joining in chants
during rallies in Tiananmen Square. It also showed secret codes and
invisible ink allegedly used by the men, all Chinese citizens.
   China has maintained that the student protesters were manipulated
by outside forces.
   News reports said the 13 were recruited by military intelligence
officers of the Nationalist government on Taiwan, and by local
agents.
   China's Xinhua News Agency quoted the State Security Ministry as
saying that Taiwan ordered the alleged spies to ``exploit the
so-called `democratic movement,' escalate it into an overall
`anti-Communist' movement and collect information for the Taiwan
secret service.''
   National television also gave prominent coverage to a meeting of
State Education Commission head Li Tieying and a delegation from the
World Bank.
   Li has been mentioned frequently in recent news reports,
bolstering theories he is rising in China's political hierarchy and
may be headed for a position on the powerful Communist Party
Politburo Standing Committee.
   Party officials are expected to meet soon and two moderates on
the five-member committee, party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and
party propaganda chief Hu Qili, are expected to be officially ousted
from their posts.
   Qiao Shi, the committee member responsible for security matters,
is expected to succeed Zhao as party boss. Li is a candidate to fill
Hu's position.
   The moderates reportedly were stripped of their authority after
losing a power struggle to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Premier Li
Peng and other political hard-liners who backed the crackdown on the
democracy movement.
   Zhao has not been seen since May 19, when he met with protesting
students in Tiananmen Square and expressed sympathy for their
demands, including an end to official corruption and a free press.
Premier Li imposed martial law on the city the next day.

   A Hawaii woman is trying to accomplish what an
entire Soviet army can't do in the movies: Beat Sylvester Stallone.
   Nancy Sutherland is challenging the ``Rambo'' and ``Rocky'' star
in federal court, saying she should be the owner of 5.5 acres of
Stallone's oceanfront land on Kauai Island.
   Sutherland, contending she made a deal on the property before
Stallone did, wants to get Stallone out or collect damages from the
sellers.
   Stallone will have to testify if the case goes to trial,
according to his attorney, David Dezzani.
   ``He's looked at the land, been to the land a number of times,
and it is a piece uniquely valuable to him because it is remote
enough to allow him the privacy that he needs,'' Dezzani said.
   Sutherland, trustee for the Ralph L. Evans Trust, contends she
offered $1.4 million in 1984 to Boyce Brown, an attorney for a
company called Kaonohi Ohana. She said Brown accepted the offer.
   But before Brown could check with the company's stockholders,
Stallone offered $1.75 million and took control of the land.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel King asked both sides to return to
court next month for a pretrial scheduling hearing.
   Stallone has bought an adjoining 58,000-square-foot beachfront
lot, giving him control of 1,300 feet of oceanfront land.

   Maury Povich has renewed his contract with
television's ``A Current Affair,'' the syndicated quasi-newsmagazine.
   Povich was rumored to be considering other offers, including one
from King World, which has the rival ``Inside Edition.'' But earlier
this week, King World announced that it had renewed anchor Bill
O'Reilly.
   ``We're so happy that Maury has chosen us in view of such a wide
range of tempting offers from other broadcast entities,'' said
Gerald Stone, executive producer of ``A Current Affair.'' Povich,
perhaps best known as the husband of network newswoman Connie Chung,
signed what was described as a ``multiyear'' agreement.
   ``A Current Affair,'' which is distributed by Twentieth Century
Fox Television, is carried by 150 stations nationwide and is just
completing its first year in national syndication.

   This town of 825 wants permission to put
up a bronze statue of its most famous ``future'' son _ the
23rd-century space explorer Capt. James T. Kirk of the Starship
Enterprise.
   ``Star Trek'' fan Steve Miller, who four years ago decided his
hometown was to be Kirk's birthplace, is working with Paramount
Pictures to get permission to build the statue in the town park. The
statue would go along with a 20-foot model of the Enterprise
spaceship that stands in the park.
   A 1968 book about the ``Star Trek'' television show says Kirk was
born in a ``small town in Iowa'' on March 26, 2228. Gene
Roddenberry, creator of ``Star Trek,'' gave his blessing to Miller's
idea of designating Riverside as that town.
   Riverside, about 50 miles west of Davenport, also plays host each
year to Trek Fest. The fifth celebration is set for this weekend.
   The statue would cost about $10,000, and private donations would
pay for it, Miller said. He's aiming to have it put up in time for
the 25th birthday of the television show in September 1991, and have
William Shatner, the actor who plays Kirk, at the dedication.
   Miller has received telephone calls from people as far away as
California, asking for information about the Trek Fest, which
attracted 8,000 people last year. ``It's amazing the people that
come into the state just for this thing,'' he said.

   French President Francois Mitterrand on
Thursday awarded the Alexis de Tocqueville prize to Mexican poet
Octavio Paz, describing him as a ``remarkable author, and a
compelling and luminous poet.''
   The presentation of the award was made in this small town in
Normandy in western France where de Tocqueville lived.
   ``I salute you as a poet, as a free man and as a friend,''
Mitterrand told Paz at the ceremony.
   In his reply, Paz said he had always denied any form of
``totalitarian superstition,'' and declared his concern to ``search
out the reconciliation of the two great modern political currents:
liberalism and socialism.''
   The prize was created 10 years ago in memory of de Tocqueville, a
19th-century French social philosopher who wrote a celebrated study
of democracy in America after visiting the United States. It is
given every two years.
   Previous winners of the prize include French writer and
philosopher Raymond Aron, U.S. social scientist David Riesman and
Soviet philosopher Alexandre Zinoviev.

<TEXT>
   One of Maine's more colorful township
names will soon disappear from the atlas, thanks to new legislation.
   Misery Gore, on the shore of Moosehead Lake in northern Maine,
was created in the early 1800s by mistake, according to legend. Two
sets of township boundary lines established by separate surveying
teams inadvertently left a sliver of land in between.
   What remained was a 17-mile-long, string bean-shaped tract _ only
a half-mile wide at its widest point _ that became known as Misery
Gore. It's not clear how the Misery part of the name came about, but
gores are small, uusually triangular pieces of land.
   The legislation, signed by Gov. John R. McKernan, corrects the
surveying error and gives pieces of the area to adjoining
unorganized townships, a designation for roughly half of rural Maine.
   The bill also frees Scott Paper Co., which owns most of the land
in Misery Gore, from having to maintain two sets of property lines.
   Maine is not left without its gores, however. Still remaining on
the map are Moxie Gore, Hibberts' Gore and Veazie Gore, among others.

   It took John DeZell 25 years, but he's
finally passed the bar exam on his 10th attempt.
   ``It takes persistence and knowledge,'' the 56-year-old insurance
salesman said. ``But I would always tell people I would trade some
of that persistence for more knowledge.''
   Neither the Oregon Bar Association nor the state Supreme Court
keeps track of this kind of effort, but DeZell figures he holds the
state record for most attempts on the bar exam.
   Along the way, DeZell learned a lot about broken dreams. He
received an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was forced
out by a medical problem.
   He earned a law degree from Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland,
but failed the bar exam three straight times, the maximum allowed.
In 1966 he turned to selling insurance to support his family.
   Then the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional to
restrict the number of times someone could take the bar exam.
   So with encouragement from his wife, DeZell decided in 1986 to
try again.
   DeZell didn't do very well in his first comeback bid, but did a
little better the next five times until last July he missed passing
by just one point.
   ``I thought it was within my reach finally,'' he said. ``I was
studying and reading law books most of the time.''
   DeZell said if he hadn't passed February's test on his 10th
attempt, he still would be trying.
   ``I'm very committed to the practice of law, and I'm going to
enjoy it,'' DeZell said.

   Hundreds of civil rights activists
boarded buses Thursday to retrace the trail of the 1960s Freedom
Riders and honor three slain volunteers. Many carried with them a
new attitude about this southern state.
   ``I'm leaving with an improved image of Mississippi,'' said
Minnie Sutton, 65, of New York. ``This state has made strides
forward although it looks like there's still a ways to go.''
   Sutton was among 470 pilgrims who arrived in a caravan of 13
buses from New York and Philadelphia, Pa., to attend ceremonies
Wednesday in Philadelphia, Miss., honoring three civil rights
workers who were slain 25 years ago.
   More than 1,000 people went to a church once burned by the Ku
Klux Klan to hear veteran civil rights activists and state officials
pay tribute to the work of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael
Schwerner during a commemoration of their deaths on June 21, 1964.
   On Thursday, 10 chartered buses left Meridian en route to
Washington and additional ceremonies. The caravan, modeled on the
North-to-South Freedom Rides of the 1960s, will end in New York
later in the week.
   Several of those boarding the buses described thier trip as a
learning experience and several agreed with Sutton that improvements
had occurred in Mississippi in the years since the killings.
   Secretary of State Dick Molpus, a Philadelphia native who was 14
at the time of the slayings, said the ceremony ``was good for
Mississippians and for people acorss this country.
   ``We were able to send the message out very clearly that a new
day has dawned here in our state and at the same time we had the
opportunity to acknowledge a dark corner of our past, said Molpus,
who offered an apology in remarks to Wednesday's ceremony.
   ``Obviously, things aren't perfect in Mississippi but because of
the turmoil of our past, there is a special racial sensitivity and
we hope that sensitivity can serve as a beacon for the rest of the
nation,'' Molpus said.
   ``We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' he said.
``We wish we could undo it. Every decent person in Philadelphia and
Neshoba County feels that way.''
   The observance, in front of the Mount Zion Methodist Church,
where Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner had been conducting a black
voter registration meeting the night they were killed, showed that
``Mississippi and America are far different places than they were 25
years ago,'' Gov. Ray Mabus said.
   After leaving the church, the three men were arrested on a
traffic violation and taken to the Neshoba County Jail in
Philadelphia, 60 miles northeast of Jackson.
   They disappeared after being released and an FBI investigation
concluded they were shot to death by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
Their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam.
   Schwerner, 24, and Goodman, 20, were white volunteers from the
New York City area. Chaney was a 21-year-old black man from Meridian.

   The only son of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini wants a role in Iran's hierarchy following his father's
death but is not sure what to aim for, Tehran Radio reported
Thursday.
   The report, quoting Hojatoleslam Mohammad Ali Ansari, indicates
Ahmad Khomeini won't run in presidential elections scheduled July 28.
   ``When we have been with him (Ahmad) we have never heard a word
which would indicate his participation or his aim of participating
in political issues,'' Ansari said in an interview with Tehran
Radio, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   Ansari is a leading radical clergyman working at the ayatollah's
office and a close friend of Ahmad Khomeini.
   The younger Khomeini allied himself with radicals when his father
unleashed a resurgence of fundamentalism in February, calling on
Moslems to kill British writer Salman Rushdie for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I think that society expects a person who has been trained at
the side of the imam ... like him (Ahmad) to be always on the stage
in the path of the advancement of the imam's aspirations, and this
is also what he intends to do,'' Ansari said.
   However, he stressed, ``no firm decision has been taken by him.''
   Iranians called the revolutionary patriarch who died of a heart
attack June 3 their imam, or supreme leader. Khomeini was 86 years
old.
   Several officials had predicted the younger Khomeini, who was his
father's closest adviser, would exploit the wave of emotion
engulfing Iran after Khomeini's death to advance his political
ambitions.
   Khomeini's daughter, Zahra Mustafavi, said in a recent interview
that Ahmad had aspired to become president since 1981, but that her
father always insisted on keeping his children out of politics.
   She said she expected Ahmad to run for presidency this year. But
he still had not declared any plan six days before the consitutional
period for announcing candidacy ends June 28.
   The powerful Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rasfsanjani, is the only
candidate for the post.
   Rafsanjani, who also is acting commander in chief of the armed
forces, leads the so-called pragmatists who advocate a more open
policy toward the West and an end to the isolation imposed since
Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Rafsanjani, 55, is allied with Ali Khamenei, Iran's president
since 1981 who cannot run for re-election when his second term
expires next month.

   City Councilor Richard Chapman likes to
quote the late Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes as he
fights a recall campaign that began when he successfully sponsored
an anti-smoking ordinance.
   ``He said, `Your right to throw a punch stops where my nose
begins,''' said Chapman. ``I think that's very apropos for the
smoking issue.''
   Elected to the council from a heavily Republican district two
years ago, Democrat Chapman has angered pro-smoking groups so much
that they are seeking his removal in an election Tuesday.
   The ordinance that he sponsored was passed last fall by an 8-1
vote and took effect April 19. Similar laws are in effect in more
than 300 cities. For now, violators are simply receiving a warning,
but beginning July 19 they will face up to a $100 fine for each
offense.
   Smokers Rights of New Mexico contends the council violated the
civil rights of thousands of tobacco users by prohibiting smoking in
such places as offices, art galleries, shopping malls, libraries,
theaters, bingo parlors, taxis and buses.
   ``It's an overregulation of government and discriminatory because
it segregates the smokers from non-smokers,'' said Dorothy Jameson,
one of the recall backers. ``It is making a criminal act out of a
legal act.''
   If the recall is successful, said Jameson, supporters hope it
will be a message to the council to reconsider the ordinance. The
group had no plans to seek removal of other council members, she
said.
   ``We feel the person who wrote it is the one we should go
after,'' said Jameson, 66, who by her estimation averages a pack of
cigarettes a day.
   Only the 20,000 registered voters in Chapman's northeast
Albuquerque district are eligible to vote. For the recall proposal
to pass, it must get not only a majority of the votes cast Tuesday
but also more than half the number of votes cast in the 1987 city
council election.
   Chapman said his campaign against the recall has received more
than $5,600 in contributions, and he he expects the tobacco industry
to make at least a token contribution to the other side.
   ``This is a landmark situation for them and if they were
successful in the recall, then they'd have something going,'' he
said. ``I'd be very surprised if they don't do a computerized
mailing to smokers.''
   ``They are not involved,'' countered Jameson. ``It's just a bunch
of people beginning to stick up for their rights.''
   She and other recall supporters go so far as comparisons to
events in the early days of the Nazis' rise to power.
   ``A friend of mine was raised in Germany during the war, and she
said it started out on a very low key,'' said Gloria Mitchell, also
of Smokers Rights of New Mexico. ``One by one, their rights were
taken away. It's like a mouse eating away at a mound of cheese. A
bite at a time, and pretty soon the whole cheese is gone.''
   On the other side, a letter to the editor from Lindsay McMurray
said, ``Until smokers become responsible for their actions, someone
has to make reasonable and responsible choices for all citizens.''
   Chapman said he was not surprised by the furor created by the
ordinance. But he said the council was merely adopting a policy that
many of the larger private companies and the city's school system
already had in place. He said that he had never heard of another
official facing a recall election because of an anti-smoking
ordinance.
   Chapman also cited a study done last year for the American Lung
Association that showed a far greated number of people than
previously estimated, up to 46,000 a year, die from passive smoking
_ inhaling the smoke from cigarettes of other people.
   ``We're talking large numbers of people that if they were to go
to one place and die at the same time, it would be a national
disaster,'' Chapman said. ``But they all go to their individual
hospitals and homes and die an agonizing, slow and private death
that just doesn't show up.''
   Only about 15 percent of the registered voters in the district _
3,885 _ voted in the city election two years ago. Both Chapman and
his opponents expect a light turnout again Tuesday, although he
endured 100-degree temperatures this week in a door-to-door campaign.
   ``I'm taking it absolutely serious,'' Chapman said. ``A recall
has never happened in Albuquerque, and when people hear the word
they assume you have done something illegal or immoral. My job is to
convince them that I haven't.''

   Four leaders of an athletics camp for
ghetto children were sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison
today for beating to death an 8-year-old girl as other youngsters
were forced to count the blows.
   Circuit Judge John Lowe sentenced the four after rejecting a plea
from the victim's father and founder of the Ecclesia Athletic
Association, Eldridge Broussard Jr., to ``release these people until
such time as an appeal comes.''
   The four _ Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego; Constance Z.
Jackson, 38; Brian J. Brinson, 31, and Frederick P. Doolittle, 28,
all of Los Angeles _ were convicted of manslaughter May 12 in the
death of Dayna Broussard.
   Prosecutors said most of the camp's 53 children ranging from 6
weeks to 16 years were forced to watch Oct. 13 as the girl was hit
hundreds of times for stealing food from another child at their
farmhouse about 30 miles from Portland.
   Several children testified that Dayna was slammed against a wall,
kicked, tripped, slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit
upon and hung out a window.
   Broussard, 35, who said he formed Ecclesia in the Watts area of
Los Angeles to steer children away from crime and drugs and make
them Olympic-caliber athletes, was in Los Angeles at the time of his
daughter's death.
   He previously has denied that the children were beaten or abused,
saying they were only spanked.
   Jackson also was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of
beating five other Ecclesia children with a braided electrical cord.
   Witnesses testified that Chambers did most of the beating, while
Doolittle and Brinson held the girl down. Jackson was accused of
striking and biting the child.

<HEAD>Judge: Yahwehs Must Pay Tenants Hurt By `Terrorist' Eviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the Yahweh sect to pay
$940,000 to tenants who lost their homes in a strong-arm eviction
that ended in the deaths of two residents at a crime-ridden
apartment complex.
   The tenants' attorney called Thursday for a police investigation
of the sect, saying the civil trial testimony demonstrated that the
white-robed Yahwehs engaged in a policy of violence against those
who opposed them.
   ``They fire-bombed an entire block in Delray Beach, and they were
involved in slayings in other cities,'' Thomas Equels said. ``I
think the state and federal government need to carefully examine the
judge's findings here.''
   In Delray Beach, after some residents took offense at the
Yahwehs' door-to-door proseletyzing, someone threw firebombs into
apartments. No one was injured and the crime is unsolved. Witnesses
also mentioned slayings, including the unsolved killing of a former
sect member.
   The Yahwehs' attorney, Ellis Rubin, said he would appeal the
ruling, saying the sect should not be blamed for what a few members
did.
   ``We're appealing as a matter of religious freedom,'' Rubin said.
``If a Catholic commits a crime, you don't punish the pope or the
priests because of his wrongdoing.''
   U.S. District Judge James Kehoe issued his decision Wednesday in
the lawsuit filed by 27 former residents of an Opa-locka apartment
complex against the Temple of Love, the Miami-based mother church
run by the sect's leader Yahweh ben Yahweh.
   The church, which takes a strong stand against drugs, moved to
buy the apartments in 1986 after the previous owner abandoned them,
saying crack dealers and criminals had taken over the complex.
   ``They will go into a distressed area that is overrun by drug
dealers and criminal element and they will clean them up, kick out
all the wrong-doers, and then either sell or make housing available
for poor people,'' Rubin said.
   The Yahwehs, who teach that blacks are the true chosen people of
God, run businesses and property in predominantly black
neighborhoods. The Opa-locka apartment building was eventually
abandoned and now is empty.
   In the Opa-locka case, the Yahwehs, many carrying six-foot wooden
staffs, evicted everyone in the complex, threatening residents and
dumping their belongings on the street, according to the lawsuit,
which called the tactics a ``terrorist occupation strategy.''
   On Oct. 30, 1986, two tenants who publicly opposed the evictions
were shot and killed. Sect member Robert Rozier was later convicted
of murder in the case, and testified in the tenants' lawsuit.
   He said Yahweh ben Yahweh had tortured sect members and taught
them ritual murder techniques, but other witnesses disputed his
account. He also recounted acts of violence allegedly committed by
the sect in other communities.
   The judge did not rule on who was responsible for the deaths of
the two tenants, citing conflicting testimony.
   But he found that the church had engaged in running a criminal
enterprise, extortion and assault, and ordered it to pay $10,000 to
each tenant for emotional distrress, as well as reimburse them for
six times the value of the belongings they lost. An additional
$500,000 in punitive damages also will be divided among the tenants.
   Former tenant Shadell Hamilton, brother-in-law of one of those
killed, said he was pleased by the verdict, recalling his initial
sense of helplessness.
   ``I gave up. I said that there wasn't any justice, that nothing
would be done about it, because there were so many things they got
away with before,'' Hamilton said.

<HEAD>Rock Shift Moves Solstice Phenomenon</HEAD>

   Natural erosion apparently has blunted
a spike of light dubbed the ``sun dagger'' that ancient pueblo
Indians are believed to have used to mark the summer solstice.
   The dagger was formed by light shining between 9-foot-tall
sandstone slabs sitting just below the top of the 500-foot-tall
Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico. On the
solstice, the longest day of the year, the light would shine on a
spiral-shaped petroglyph etched on rock behind the slabs.
   But erosion apparently caused a rock to shift, and on Wednesday
the dagger-shaped pattern of light missed its summer-solstice mark
on the petroglyph for perhaps the first time in 1,000 years,
researchers said. Instead, the light shined above and to the left of
the Indian pattern.
   ``We're used to this thing acting like a clock,'' physicist Rolf
Sinclair said Wednesday.
   The dagger widened and lengthened into ``an overgrown carrot,''
said Anna Sofaer, an artist and archaeo-astronomer who discovered
the dagger in 1977 in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which
contains numerous ancient stone dwellings.
   The rock formation also cast distinctive light patterns at the
winter solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes _ when day and
night are of equal length.
   The petroglyph near the canyon's south entrance was believed to
have been carved between A.D. 950 and 1150, at the peak of the
Anasazi culture that once thrived in Chaco Canyon.
   Sinclair, Sofaer and others contend rocks originally might have
been manipulated to cause the sunlight patterns.
   But on Sunday, a group that included Sinclair discovered that one
of the rock slabs had shifted and had altered the phenomenon.
   ``It's very serious and sad,'' Ms. Sofaer said. ``We knew when we
first saw the site that it had a fragility that was remarkable.''
   Michael Zelik, a physics and astronomy professor at the
University of New Mexico, said the alteration raises questions about
how much or how often rocks have moved previously at the site and
about just how old it really is.
   However, Sinclair said it's clear the rocks have not moved much,
if at all, over the years. He said the erosion which caused the rock
to slip might be due to 10 years of relatively wet weather at Chaco.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria said Thursday that 250,000 ethnic
Turks have applied to emigrate to Turkey and 150,000 already have
their passports for an exodus from the communist country.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ivan Ganev, giving the figures at a news
conference, said about 50,000 ``Bulgarian Moslems'' have crossed the
border into Turkey in the past month.
   In keeping with Bulgarian practice, he refused to speak of ethnic
Turks. The estimated 1 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria, about
one-ninth of the country's population, have been forced to adopt
Bulgarian names since 1984 and had their language and religious
rites banned.
   In Ankara, Turkish officials said Thursday nearly 55,000 people
have crossed into Turkey from Bulgaria since last month, when police
used clubs and dogs to break up demonstrations by the ethnic Turks.
Officials said seven people were killed, but Western diplomats say
up to 30 died.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 5,000
Turks, many of whom openly protesting ethnic and religious
discrimination, have been expelled since then.
   The mass voluntary emigration began May 29, when President Todor
Zhivkov said any Bulgarian citizen could leave the country. Zhivkov
clearly alluded to Bulgarian Turks, who have been receiving
passports under a new law that was passed in Parliament in May.
   An official in Haskovo, a town in southeastern Bulgaria, told The
Associated Press on Wednesday that his office has issued up to 2,000
passports a day since June 4.
   Thousands of ethnic Turks, many of them farmers and construction
workers, were observed this week on their way out of Bulgaria with
every piece of property they could take.
   Government officials at the news conference indicated the labor
drain is already disrupting agriculture and many industries.
   Ivan Angelov, a government adviser, said those departing had
withdrawn up to $260 million from banks, adding the sum might reach
$1 billion if people keep leaving.
   To cope with the sudden loss of manpower, Ganev said the the
government will order longer working hours, relocate workers,
reschedule summer vacations and start a crash retraining program.
   In addition, manpower is to be moved from ``not critical'' to
``critical'' industries or areas, Ganev told the news conference
without elaborating.
   Bulgaria has been short of labor even before the current wave of
emigration, and at least 30,000 Vietnamese are employed in Bulgarian
factories.
   Throughout the news conference, Ganev and five other senior
government officials blamed the huge outflow of Turks on Turkish
propaganda and ``instigation.''
   ``Turkey has whipped up a psychosis among the Moslem
population,'' Ganev said, accusing Turkish Premier Turgut Oezal of
repeatedly issuing military threats against Bulgaria.
   Bulgaria's Christian Slavs and ethnic Turks have been deeply
suspicious of one another since the five-century rule of Turkey's
Ottoman Empire.
   Asked if Bulgaria would accept the assistance of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, he said, ``We have no refugees, so we do
not need him.''

   Twelve Roman Catholic priests say they and their
parishioners will defy orders by Cardinal Edmund C. Szoka to close
their churches by June 30.
   More than 200 Roman Catholics at St. Stanislaus Catholic Church
applauded Wednesday's action by the priests, who said they would
continue to celebrate Masses beyond the closing date.
   ``Take a look at these guys and remember their faces,'' said the
Rev. Norm Thomas, one of the 12 priests. ``Their median age is 50 so
they can only do it for the next 35 years.''
   Archdiocese of Detroit spokesman Jay Berman said priests holding
services past the deadline would be in violation of church policy.
   ``When a bishop establishes a parish, it's established _ when he
closes it, it's closed,'' Berman said. ``You can't go out and erect
(a church) without a bishop establishing a canonical decree, no
matter what Father wants to do.''
   Priests and parishioners also said they would begin a three-day
fast Sunday in hopes of influencing a civil court decision expected
Wednesday.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge James Hathaway will rule on a request
for a temporary restraining order to stop the closings until all
appeals made through the church have been exhausted.
   The threatened parishes have lost an appeal to leaders of the 1.5
million-member Detroit Archdiocese. They also have appealed to
church leaders in the Vatican.
   Szoka ordered 30 churches closed or merged with others, citing
money problems, little active participation by parishioners and a
priest shortage.

   About 30 Girl Scouts suffered minor burns
when a malfunctioning pump on a water theme park slide released too
much muriatic acid, authorities said.
   The girls' injuries ranged from skin irritation to blistering,
according to officials at Riverside Medical Center, where the girls
were examined and treated. Seven required treatment for skin burns
or eye irritation.
   More than 100 Brownie Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 9, went to the
Waupaca Waterthrills Park on Wednesday as part of daylong outing.
   ``The girls started complaining immediately when they got out of
the water,'' said Brownie leader Paulette White. ``Some of the girls
only went down the water slide once and complained that they were
starting to burn and itch.''
   Water park officials said the problem was traced to a
malfunctioning pump that releases acid to maintain a neutral pH
level for the water. The pump was fixed.

   A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests
that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a
celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said
Thursday.
   During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his
ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and
proud'' two weeks ago.
   Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British
background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed
himself to the German people in German.
   ``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said,
translating himself back into English. ``We found no human remains.
We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck
is in the hands of the German people.''
   He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so
Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship,
which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
   Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him
that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
added.
   It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German
pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the
neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the
secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked
out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her
secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking
hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
   Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered
British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
   Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by
ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas
it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized
that the Germans were giving up.
   Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's
technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
   The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of
water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in
remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved.''
   Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit
with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck!''
   Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of
German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might
have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five
more survivors.
   The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut
British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against
combined German sea and air power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within
five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a
three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the
vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
   Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the
property of the German people.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same
remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the
wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912
after striking an iceberg.

<HEAD>State Farm Slapped With $100 Million Discrimination Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Texas women filed a $100 million lawsuit
Thursday against State Farm Insurance Co., one of the nation's
largest insurance firms, alleging its hiring practices for years
have discriminated against women and minorities.
   Their class-action lawsuit accuses State Farm of reserving for
white men the jobs of sales agents, claims adjusters and
underwriters.
   ``This is a very valuable job and is a job that historically was
passed on by nepotism and cronyism in what generally is described as
a good old boys network,'' said Guy Saperstein, an Oakland, Calif.,
attorney who won a similar lawsuit against State Farm in that state
last year.
   ``This case is like that case. It's brought on behalf of all
women. And we think it's representative of what happened to women in
Texas. There were a lot of tactics used to discourage women,'' he
said.
   He alleged women were told they would need a large investment to
become an agent, that night work could be dangerous and that the
long hours could disrupt their family life.
   ``None of those statements is true,'' he said. ``What's amazing
about the Texas case is meeting these women and how it took me back
to California. Their stories are almost identical to what I heard in
California.''
   The Texas case stems from complaints filed by the women in 1980
with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Jim Stahly, a spokesman for State Farm, based in Bloomington,
Ill., said he knew little of the lawsuit but insisted the company
had been cooperating with the EEOC.
   ``In fact, all along the way we've asked the EEOC to identify
those individuals who believed they had been discriminated against
to correct any injustices there may have been, but the EEOC has not
provided us with the names,'' he said.
   He said the company's 895 agents in its Texas region included 126
women and 125 minorities.
   Plaintiff Judith Grube of Austin said she applied for a State
Farm job in 1982 after working as a secretary for a State Farm agent
but was told she did not have a college degree and did not fulfill a
minimum net worth requirement.
   She now works for Farmers Insurance Co. and described herself as
an award-winning agent who has generated more business than any
other female agent in the company.
   ``I want other people who come in to get opportunities that were
ripped away from us,'' said plaintiff Vel Yvette Payad of Dallas.
   Mrs. Payad said she was offered a job as State Farm agent in 1980
and accepted it only to be told a few days later that she was
rejected. She applied again in 1988 and was rejected. She now works
for another insurance company.
   In the California case, State Farm agreed to name women to half
its sales agents jobs and pay millions of dollars to women who
contended they were discriminated against from 1974 to 1987.
   That lawsuit accused State Farm of refusing to recruit women on
the same basis as men for agent jobs and discouraging women from
applying for the lucrative jobs. According to the lawsuit, although
80 percent of all State Farm employees in California were women, 98
percent of the agents were men.

   A chronology compiled by the National
Geographic Society of the fate of the German World War II battleship
Bismarck:
   1936 _ Construction starts in Hamburg of the 820-foot ship with a
displacement, when fully loated, of more than 50,000 tons, carrying
eight 15-inch guns, 12 5.9-inch guns and 16 4.1-inch guns and a crew
of 2,200 and capable of a top speed of 30 knots.
   Feb. 14, 1939 _ On St. Valentine's Day, Adolf Hitler launches the
ship.
   May 19, 1941 _ After more than two years in fitting and shakedown
cruises, the Bismarck sets sail from Gdynia, Poland with orders to
sink Allied merchant ships in the Atlantic while evading engagement
with allied warships.
   May 20, 1941 _ A Swedish cruiser spots the Bismarck and its
escort, the Prinz Eugen, off the coast of neutral Sweden. Later they
are sighted off the coast of Norway.
   May 21, 1941 _ British Spitfires over the Bergen-Korsfjord region
of Norway spot the two German ships. The British send the battle
cruiser Hood to join other British ships on patrol in the Denmark
Strait.
   May 22, 1941 _ More British forces head for the search zone.
   May 23, 1941 _ In the Denmark Strait beteen Greenland and
Iceland, the British cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk sight the German
ship threading through a minefield. The Bismarck opens fire, but the
British retire safely. The British follow the Germans despite rain
and snow storms and dangerous ice floes. The Hood and the Prince of
Wales are closing in from about 250 miles away.
   May 24 _ At 5:35 a.m., the Hood and Prince of Wales sight the
Bismarck and open fire. The Germans return fire. At 6:01 a.m., a
massive explosion sinks the Hood, leaving only three of its 1,419
crewmen alive. The Bismarck suffers a ruptured fuel tank. The
Bismarck engages the British again in the evening. The Prinz Eugen
escapes. The Bismarck's commander decides to make for a French port
for repairs. A British force heads to the area from Gibraltar.
Around midnight, nine British biplanes attack, causing little damage.
   May 25 _ About 3 a.m., the Bismarck evades its chasers and heads
for the safety of U-boat patrols and Luftwaffe air cover, near the
coast of France.
   May 26 _ A British plane spots the Bismarck. In a last-ditch
effort to stop it before it reaches safety, planes from a British
carrier score two torpedo hits that wreck the Bismarck's steering
gear and jam her rudders, only hours from safety. The Bismarck's
fate is sealed.
   May 27 _ At 8:47 a.m., a British force opens up on the limping
Bismarck, putting its main guns out of action. By 10 a.m., the
Bismarck is a battered hulk. By 10:39 a.m. it has capsized and sunk,
coming to rest upright on the ocean floor with only 115 of its crew
of 2,200 rescued.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Thursday strengthened its ties
with Iran, agreeing to exchange delegations of Moslem religious
leaders and indicating it would send weaponry to its Islamic
neighbor.
   The agreement with Iran came as the Soviet Union struggles with a
resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism and conflicts between its
Christians and 50 million Moslems.
   The agreement was part of a broad declaration signed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, whose visit to the Soviet Union has defrosted a decade
of icy relations.
   It implies future Soviet weapons sales to Iran, by promising the
superpower's cooperation in ``strengthening the defense capacity''
of its southern neighbor. At the same time, the document commits
both nations to strive ``to rid the world of aggression.''
   Rafsanjani later sidestepped questions about arms deals. He said
only that Iran was trying to be self-sufficient in arms but has some
``technical requirements that we would like to see met by various
sources.''
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. policy toward Iran would
be guided by developments in the country _ and not by its
relationship with the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's major weapons supplier during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war, but even then, the Soviets arranged for
the sale of arms to Iran through third countries.
   During a state dinner Wednesday, Rafsanjani invited Gorbachev to
visit Iran. If Gorbachev accepts, he would be the first leader of a
major power to visit Tehran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
   The declaration says both nations ``will strive for a broad
acquaintance with each other's life, culture, convictions, customs
and traditions.'' It specifically called for the governments to
exchange delegations of religious leaders.
   The Soviet Union has been troubled in the past 1{ years by unrest
among its more than 100 ethnic groups, especially the 50 million
Moslems on its southern borders.
   Moslem Azerbaijanis fought with Christian Armenians, resulting in
more than 90 deaths last year, and in recent weeks 100 people have
been killed in the primarily Moslem Central Asian republics in
rioting prompted by ethnic and economic problems.
   An official from one of those republics, Uzbekistan, attributed
the violence to a group trying to create a ``pan-Islamic front''
aimed at hysteria and the ouster of the European population. Soviet
reports occasionally mention Iranian flags and photographs of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini being carried by demonstrators.
   Rafsanjani, asked about the Central Asian clashes at a news
conference Thursday, said his country would not interfere with
Soviet internal affairs.
   However, he added, ``we consider Mr. Gorbachev has a long way to
come in providing freedoms and people's participation in the
democratic process.'' He did not elaborate.
   Rafsanjani, originally expected to leave Thursday, traveled to
Leningrad instead and was reportedly planning to stop in Azerbaijan
on his way home. Iran has a consulate in the republic's capital,
which Tehran Radio called ``the Moslem city of Baku'' in announcing
the changed itinerary.
   At the news conference, Rafsanjani emphasized that the talks with
Gorbachev had gone well.
   ``The optimism that we had before the meetings has been totally
justified,'' Rafsanjani said.
   On other issues, Rafsanjani:
   _ accused the United States of unspecified ``plots and
conspiracies'' against Iran when asked about the possibility that
relations would improve after the death of Khomeini, Iran's
spiritual leader.
   _ said Khomeini's order stands for the killing of Salman Rushdie,
the British author of the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many
Moslems consider blasphemous. Khomeini's judgment was based on
Islamic law and ``this is not the kind of prescription that can be
reversed. There is no one in Iran who could reverse it.''
   _ said Afghans must be free to resolve their differences without
outside interference after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from
their country more than four months ago.
   Gorbachev and Rafsanjani agreed to cooperate in several areas,
including atomic energy, space and gas processing.
   Rafsanjani suggested a Soviet-Iranian space voyage, and Gorbachev
ordered his deputies to begin working out the details.
   Rafsanjani emphasized in remarks distributed by Tass on Wednesday
that several months before his death on June 3, Khomeini called for
better relations with the Soviet Union. Tass said Gorbachev and
Khomeini exchanged messages in February, and since then their
foreign ministers have met four times.

   Panicked families crowded the airport in a Central
Asian desert town where four people were killed in ethnic violence,
official media reported Thursday.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said that although the town
of Novy Uzen was quiet on Wednesday, its airport ``is packed with
families'' trying to flee.
   Pravda also said the disturbances had spread to settlements about
40 miles away in the Kazakhstan republic. About 500 people
demonstrated in Zhetibai and two people were hurt in Munaishi, the
newspaper said.
   It said ethnic Kazakhs in Novy Uzen demanded Sunday that all
members of Caucasus ethnic groups be evicted within a week. More
than one-third of Novy Uzen's 56,000 residents are from the Caucasus.
   ``The demand was accompanied by threats,'' Pravda said without
elaborating.
   The government newspaper Izvestia called the demand
``anti-constitutional'' and said it could not be met.
   The violence began Friday during a fight at a dance, and more
than 50 police officers and soldiers were injured in rioting over
the next four days.
   Hundreds of Interior Ministry soldiers were sent to the town and
authorites imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew.
   Officials on Thursday tightened their control over Novy Uzen's
water, sewer and electrical systems, as well as food stores and a
bread factory _ all targets of rioters who want to ``be able to
dictate their own conditions to the authorities,'' Izvestia said.
   Ethnic Kazakhs say the Caucasus settlers dominate the oil
industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential
treatment in housing and other benefits.
   The settlers also have set up private businesses that sell
supplies in the isolated desert town for exorbitant prices, Izvestia
said.
   Corrupt party and government workers in Novy Uzen also
contributed to widespread discontent by ``getting involved in dirty
deals,'' the official news agency Tass quoted top Kazakhstan
officials as saying.
   In Alma Ata, the republic's capital, an ethnic Kazakh was named
the region's new party chief to replace Gennady Kolbin, an ethnic
Russian. He left the post to become chairman of the People's Control
Committee, which monitors government ministries, Tass reported.
   The appointment of Kolbin as party chief in 1986 touched off
widespread rioting in Alma Ata that left hundreds injured and at
least two dead.
   The new party chief, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been premier of
Kazakhstan since 1984. The 49-year-old Nazarbayev was the first
Soviet official to admit the 1986 unrest was ethnically motivated
and not hooliganism as press reports claimed.
   The former metal worker backs greater economic independence for
the republic of more than 16 million, Tass said.
   The unrest in Novy Uzen was the third outbreak of ethnic rioting
in Soviet Central Asia in the past six weeks.
   In the worst of the violence, native Uzbeks attacked the Meskhi
Turk minority in the Fergana Valley of eastern Uzbekistan and about
100 people were killed. Most of the victims were Meskhi Turks, who
were forcibly resettled in the valley in 1944 by the late dictator
Josef Stalin.
   The Fergana region has quieted down, and police there have been
detaining people for ``inciting unlawful actions,'' Tass said
Thursday.

<HEAD>New U.S. African Affairs Official Expects New Proposals from Pretoria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new U.S. official for
African affairs said Thursday he expects Pretoria to make
``interesting proposals'' after the September general elections, and
hopes blacks will be ready to respond.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
said he will talk to South African government officials and leaders
of the outlawed African National Congress during a trip to the
region in July.
   He spoke from Washington in a special U.S. Information Service
hookup with four South African cities.
   Cohen repeatedly mentioned ``the new government of South
Africa,'' apparently referring to the fact that National Party
leader F.W. de Klerk is expected to replace retiring P.W. Botha as
president after September parliamentary elections. They exclude
voting by the 28 million black majority.
   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa for 41 years, is
virtually certain to remain in power.
   Cohen said he will visit Lusaka, Zambia, and tell exiled leaders
of the ANC, South Africa's biggest guerrilla organization: ``I'm
expecting the new South African government to be coming up with some
interesting proposals. If the new government proposed a dialogue,
will you be ready?''
   If Pretoria lifts a four-year state of emergency, Cohen said,
``there has to be a reciprocal element that political activity would
be nonviolent.''
   He said this ``will be one of the major topics'' when Albertina
Sisulu, co-president of the banned United Democratic Front, meets
President Bush next week. Mrs. Sisulu is prohibited from speaking in
public or leaving her home at night without permission. The passport
allowing her to visit Bush is the first granted her and is valid for
only 30 days.
   Cohen said a visit to Washington by de Klerk still is ``the
subject of diplomatic discussions.''
   He gave an overview of the Bush administration's Africa policy,
noting it still is under review.
   ``You will see probably a more activist role of the United States
on the issue of internal constitutional change in South Africa. What
we'd like to do is be more active in promoting a dialogue between
the government and the black leadership. I think we could be a
catalyst.''
   He said the Reagan administration had concentrated on U.N.
Resolution 435 bringing independence to Namibia and the withdrawal
of Cuban troops from Angola _ settled by a transition plan now under
way.
   ``The next priority of our policy is trying to promote settlement
in South Africa itself,'' Cohen said. ``The successful completion of
435 could lead to more peacemaking. Mozambique and Angola (where
rebels are fighting Marxist governments) are ready for peacemaking
efforts.''
   He said the United States helped develop an African summit to
resolve the Angolan civil war that began Thursday in Zaire. ``We may
have a breakthrough,'' Cohen said.
   He also saw a ``greater effort at multilateral diplomacy'' in
southern Africa _ coordinating with former colonizers Portugal, the
United Kingdom and West Germany _ and ``greater cohesion'' in the
U.S. Congress.
   ``We welcome South Africa's new diplomatic effort in Southern
Africa. It has changed from a policy of destabilization to one of
cooperation,'' Cohen said.
   ``Sanctions have had a very major impact on development of new
thinking in South Africa,'' he said, but Bush wants to concentrate
on dialogue.
   ``But you cannot even begin that without the release of black
leaders and the lifting of the emergency so non-violent political
activity can take place.
   ``If progress on these lines is not made within two years of the
new government it would be difficult for the U.S. to hold back
forces demanding increased pressure, and it would be difficult for
Western Europe and Japan as well.''

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Request for Access to Classified Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has rejected a request by
former National Security Adviser John Poindexter for access to
classified documents in the Iran-Contra case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene also said Poindexter must
narrow his other requests for material.
   The ruling follows statements last week by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh that prosecutors would abandon substantial portions
of the indictment against Poindexter.
   Poindexter is charged with four counts of obstructing and making
false statements to Congress in connection with Lt. Col. Oliver
North's activities on behalf of the Contras and a November 1985 arms
shipment to Iran.
   Walsh plans to retain portions of the indictment alleging that
Poindexter conspired with North and others in the obstructions and
false statements. He said he would seek dismissal of theft and wire
fraud charges against Poindexter pertaining to the diversion of Iran
arms sale proceeds.
   Poindexter should ``reformulate and limit his demands,'' Greene
said in a four-page order signed Wednesday and made public Thursday.
   The judge rejected a wide-ranging request for classified
documents that Poindexter filed June 12, four days before Walsh
announced his intention to reduce the scope of the indictment.
   An 64-page request for material filed May 15 demanded that the
government give Poindexter ``all documents created between Dec. 1,
1981, and the present'' referring to U.S. support for the Contras.
   Poindexter also demanded notebooks, diaries and other documents
relating to former President Reagan, Vice President Bush, CIA
Director William Casey and former Secretary of State George Shultz,
as well as all material tending to establish that Reagan or Bush
directed the National Security Council staff to ensure that the
Contras would be supported during a congressional ban on military
aid to the rebels.

   Officials tossed a life preserver Thursday to
Christopher Columbus to mark the beginning of a restoration project
of the crumbling monument.
   ``This sculpture, excellent in its artistry and priceless in its
symbolism, is among our city's most important cultural artifacts,
and it will be saved,'' said Mayor Edward Koch. He helped attach a
plywood life preserver to its base in a ceremony with other city
officials and prominent Italian-Americans.
   Since 1892, the 13-foot-tall Carrara marble statue of Columbus,
maps in hand, has gazed down from atop a 26-foot granite column. On
the pedestal, a winged figure, now virtually faceless, looks at a
globe.
   The city wants the monument, designed by the Italian sculptor
Gaetano Russo, restored for the 500th anniversary in 1992 of
Columbus' discovery of America.
   The monument has been corroded by sulfuric acid in the air. The
Columbus Citizens Foundation raised the money for the restoration,
which is expected to cost $275,000.

<HEAD>Uninsured Patients Who Are Hospitalized Get Less Treatment, Study
Says</HEAD>

   People without medical insurance not only are less
likely to get into hospitals than insured patients, they also get
less treatment once they're there, a new study of Boston hospital
patients has found.
   But the finding doesn't necessarily mean the uninsured get worse
care, because doctors may keep insured patients in the hospital
longer than necessary and may give them more treatment than they
need, researchers said.
   Previous studies have revealed that the poor, minorities and
people without health insurance have less chance of getting medical
care than others.
   But ``there has been a feeling that once you get into the system,
everybody is treated the same,'' said Joel Weissman, a health-policy
specialist at Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the
new study. ``What we're seeing is that even after you get into the
hospital, these patterns persist.''
   Weissman and Dr. Arnold M. Epstein, also of Harvard, examined the
treatment of more than 65,000 patients at 52 hospitals in the Boston
area during 1983.
   They found that uninsured patients, on average, underwent fewer
procedures and were discharged earlier than patients covered by Blue
Cross. The uninsured also were discharged earlier than Medicaid
patients, the study said.
   Though the differences were not great, they should serve as a
``red flag'' to spur further investigation, Weissman said in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   More studies will be necessary to determine if the Boston-area
trends reflect those in the rest of the nation, said Weissman, who
added that Harvard is currently working to update the 1983 findings.
   The study also found that people with different types of medical
problems tended to end up at different types of hospitals, with the
major teaching hospitals and public hospitals taking the brunt of
the tough cases among the uninsured.
   ``Although we lacked data on income and housing situation, the
results are consistent with the popular view of the urban public
hospital as the provider of last resort for persons with multiple
problems at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale,'' the researchers
said.
   After correcting statistically for differences in severity of
illness and other factors, the researchers found that uninsured
patients stayed in the hospital half a day less than Blue Cross
patients _ 5.36 compared with 5.79 days.
   The uninsured underwent about 7 percent fewer procedures _
operations or tests _ per stay than Blue Cross patients, 1.16 vs.
1.25, respectively, the researchers said.
   ``The effects we found occurred in all types of hospitals,
including major teaching and public hospitals _ institutions
commonly considered to be relatively blind to payment source,'' the
researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Though the results suggest that hospitals or physicians tailor
people's medical care according to ability to pay, or that patients
do so themselves to avoid high bills, it doesn't necessarily mean
the uninsured are getting inferior care, the researchers said.
   ``We know, for example, that lengths of stay have been decreasing
nationwide during the last decade, but so far there is little
evidence that the quality of care has been reduced,'' they said.
   Longer stays and more procedures among insured patients in the
Boston area may represent overuse of medical resources, they said.
   ``Further research is warranted to clarify whether lower
utilization represents inadequate care and whether alternative
financial and organization arrangements can remedy the situation,''
the researchers said.

   The crippled Soviet ocean liner Maxim Gorky
reached a remote archipelago for repairs Thursday, two days after
its bow was ripped open when it hit an iceberg while on a cruise.
   The ship reached Coles Bay on Svalbard, the largest of the
Spitzbergen Archipelago, said Jan Klyver, an administrative official
for the Norwegian islands. The secluded bay has no wharf or
facilities but offers shelter from wind and waves, he said.
   The 630-foot Maxim Gorky was kept afloat with pumps after a
20-foot gash was ripped in its bow and it took on 18,000 tons of
water during a midnight sun cruise in the Norwegian Sea.
   All of the 575 passengers and 378 crew were rescued. The
passengers and some crew were brought to shelter at Spitzbergen and
flown home from there.
   Soviet spokesman Andrei Romanov told the Norwegian news agency
NTB the Maxim Gorky anchored in the bay with 184 crew aboard.
Temporary repairs were being made there to allow the ship to sail to
Bremerhaven, West Germany, its port of embarkation.
   He did not estimate how long repairs would take. Soviet news
reports said the ship would be back in service in three weeks.
   The Soviet newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said Thursday the ship
may have rammed a metal object frozen in the ice or that a large old
piece of ice unexpectedly surfaced.
   Norwegian maritime experts said the Maxim Gorky was sailing too
fast for conditions in an area clogged with drifting ice up to 20
feet thick.
   Sigurn Kleiven, commander of the Norwegian coast guard vessel
Senja, which rescued passengers, dimissed claims the Soviet crew was
drunk during the accident or rescue. A Norwegian doctor aboard the
Senja said Wednesday that Soviet sailors were intoxicated.
   ``There was absolutely no drunkenness on the part of the Soviet
crew involved in the rescue,'' Kleiven was quoted as saying in the
daily newspaper Aftenposten. He did say, however, that some waiters,
service personnel and passengers had been drinking.
   Some passengers spent seven hours in open boats among the ice
floes waiting to be taken to safety and were given alcohol by the
crew.
   ``Drinking alcohol during exposure to cold is a bad
combination,'' said Mads Gilbert, the Norwegian doctor.

   A prominent Israeli history professor was
stabbed to death in Jerusalem on Thursday, and police said they were
investigating whether the killing was a terrorist attack.
   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot a Palestinian man
to death and detained 30 others during a raid on the village of
Silwad, an army spokesman said.
   Soldiers also shot and wounded four Palestinian youths in clashes
with stone-throwers in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The body of Hebrew University professor Menachem Stern was found
by schoolchildren in a park near Israel's Parliament building,
police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   Stern, 64, was stabbed several times in the chest, Sandori said.
He said robbery was ruled out as a motive because a watch and money
were found on Stern's body.
   Asked whether investigators believed terrorists were to blame,
Sandori said: ``This direction is also being checked.''
   Israel television reported police have questioned 70 people,
mostly Arabs, and have detained two of the Arabs.
   Army Radio said Israel's Shin Bet secret service was called in to
investigate.
   Stern, a winner of Israel's top prize for academic excellence,
also lectured at Harvard and Oxford universities.
   Jewish academics said he was considered the world's leading
expert on the history of the Jews during the Second Temple period,
166 B.C. to A.D. 70, when Jews in the land of Israel were ruled by
Greek and Roman conquerors.
   During this time, the Jews rebuilt their ancient temple in
Jerusalem for the second time and established their second
independent commonwealth.
   Professor Daniel Schwartz, an associate of Stern's, said he was a
dedicated academician who was ``not involved in anything political.''
   He said Stern ``was aware there were some dangers involved
walking around Jerusalem'' and that his wife was concerned about the
park path he often took to work ``because it was out of sight.''
   The death of the Arab in Silwad raised to 528 the number of
Palestinians killed in the 18{-month uprising against Israeli rule
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-three Israelis also
have died in the violence.
   The army spokesman's office said 22-year-old Abdel Raouf Mohammed
Hamad was fatally shot ``after he refused to obey an order to stop''
when troops raided the community, 12 miles north of Jerusalem.
   It was the latest in a series of search-and-arrest missions to
capture Palestinian activists.
   The Arabs detained during the raid were suspected of stoning or
firebombing cars of Jewish settlers on nearby highways, the army
said.
   Palestinians in nearby villages said Thursday they received
unsigned warning notes from settlers threatening retaliatory action
against any attacks.
   ``We are going to be forced to take harsh measures against all
those who are behind the disturbances,'' said the fliers, printed in
Arabic and strewn on village streets.
   Jewish settlers have been blamed for a series of attacks on
Palestinians in recent weeks. The latest incident occured on Tuesday
after the funeral of an American-born Jewish settler, Frederick
Steven Rosenfeld, who allegedly was stabbed to death by Palestinians.
   After the funeral, a settler opened fire with an Uzi submachine
gun on Arab laborers on a street near Tel Aviv, wounding two. The
settler's name and hometown have been withheld by police.
   A Tel Aviv court extended the settler's detention for 15 days in
a closed-door hearing on Thursday. Police said he also was under
investigation for organizing other attacks on Arabs, Army Radio
reported.
   A court convicted a Palestinian man in the stabbing deaths of two
elderly Jews on a Jerusalem street on May 3. Three others were
injured in the attack.
   The court said Nidal Abdel Razik Zaloum, 25, from the West Bank
town of El-Bireh, confessed to the killings. He is to be sentenced
Friday. The prosecutor has asked for two consecutive life terms.

   So many people are obeying a new recycling
law that newspapers were piled to the ceiling and trucks had to wait
in line to drop trash at the local recycling center. The city
finally closed the center.
   The National Temple Recycling Center, the main one in the city,
was inundated with newspapers, cans and plastics after the city
expanded its mandatory curbside pickup program, which began this
spring, from 49,000 households to 97,000 in northwestern
Philadelphia.
   The response amazed recycling officials, who thought it would
take much longer to educate people about the ordinance requiring
them to sort recyclables and leave them at curbside.
   ``Previous experiences led us to expect about 30 percent
participation,'' said Tom Klein of the Philadelphia Recycling
Office. Instead, unofficial surveys place it at close to 90 percent
in the new recycling zone.
   ``We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation,''
he said. ``We just weren't ready for that response.''
   Neither was the recycling center. Almost within days, the amount
of recycled materials received at the plant jumped from 12 tons a
day to 35 tons.
   Newspapers reached the ceiling. Bottles and cans gathered in
mounds. A fenced-in area outside the plant, once a parking lot,
became a storage area. Lines of recycling trucks waited to drop
their cargo.
   On June 16, the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections
closed the plant because of dangerous, unhealthy conditions.
   Since then the backlog has eased, except for newspapers. They are
a special problem, because there is a newspaper glut on the
recycling market, said Mjenzi Traylor, head of the plant. ``It's
costing us $15 to $17 to bail a ton,'' he said. ``And for the most
part, we're getting $5 or less per ton.''
   A recycling center in nearby Bucks County has volunteered to take
some of the excess, but Traylor said that is only a temporary
solution.
   The officials plan to meet Monday to discuss ways of alleviating
the situation. ``We're in a fortunate position because we have a
number of major users of recycled paper here in the community,''
said Klein.
   Klein said the problems will not affect plans to expand the
mandatory recycling program into the northeastern part of the city
July 24.
   He said the city has contracted with a separate recycling
company, Waste Management, to handle the additional 45,000
households.
   Though the recycling is mandatory, although Klein said his office
will not push the issue for the time being. ``We're having problems
with 90 percent compliance,'' he said. ``Why would we push to get it
to 100 percent?''

<HEAD>Valve Problem Stops Low-Power Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-power testing of the reactor at the
Seabrook nuclear power plant was halted Thursday because of a
problem with a steam valve, operators said.
   The reactor was running at 3 percent of maximum power at the
engineers shut it down, said spokesman Ron Sher.
   ``The valve remained open longer than it should have, drawing too
much steam away from the plant's steam generators,'' Sher said.
``Under our strict operating procedures, control room operators
manually shut down the reactor.''
   He said the engineers went to work to correct the problem so the
reactor could be re-started.
   He said the valve was on the non-nuclear side of the plant. Hot,
pressurized, contaminated water from the reactor flows through a
heat exchanger and back to the reactor. On the non-nuclear side,
water flows into the heat exchanger, picks up heat from the nuclear
side and becomes steam to drive the turbines that spin the plant's
generators.
   Sher said the valve directs steam that normally would drive the
plant's turbines back to a steam condenser instead. He said the
steam bypasses the turbines during low-power testing.
   Because it stayed open, more steam condensed to water, thus
cooling the system too quickly.
   Sher said the problem wasn't considered serious enough to warrant
notifications to state and federal regulatory officials, but Nuclear
Regulatory Commission observers were in the control room at the time.
   Sher said the valve, one of about 6,000 in the plant, is not
associated with three other valves that malfunctioned earlier this
month, delaying the start of the tests.
   ``The reason we do tests is to ensure that all plant systems are
working as designed. The low-power testing of the reactor in the
past nine days has gone very well, and this is the first
interruption we've had in the schedule,'' he said.
   Seabrook officials won regulatory permission to conduct the tests
despite long opposition from Massachusetts and anti-nuclear
activists who argue nearby beaches and communities could never be
safely evacuated in the event of an accident.
   The plant has not yet won a commercial operating license, but
utility officials predict they will be selling Seabrook power by the
end of the year.

<HEAD>U.S.-British Agreement on Developing New Missile for Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain has signed an agreement with the United
States to help develop a new air-launched nuclear missile, a Defense
Ministry spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman, who refused to be identified, said the agreement
for a U.S. feasibility study on updating one of Britain's key
strategic weapons _ a sensitive issue with the Soviet Union _ was
signed Dec. 1 but not announced at the time.
   Officials acknowledged the agreement after Jane's Defense Weekly
reported it. It said the American company Martin Marietta Corp. is
investigating with British Aerospace PLC the possibility of
developing a new tactical air-to-surface missile.
   The missile with a range of 250-370 miles and fired from Tornado
bombers would replace Britain's aging WE177 free-fall nuclear bomb.
   The spokesman said the U.S. agreement did not mean that the
British were abandoning a possible deal with France.
   ``We have not signed a similar memorandum of understanding with
the French, but both American and French systems remain open as
options for consideration,'' he said.
   However, the Anglo-French project appeared virtually certain of
being abandoned. It involved developing a longer-range version of
France's ASMP nuclear air-to-surface missiles.
   Negotiations began about two years ago, there has been no sign of
progress, and Defense Ministry sources have said in recent months
that the French system is unsuitable for British bombers.
   The strategic importance of air-launched nuclear weapons has
increased following the 1987 agreement between the United States and
the Soviet Union to withdraw all their medium-range, land-based
nuclear weapons from Europe.
   The Soviet Union has complained that updating air-launched
missiles violates the spirit of the 1987 agreement.
   Jane's, an authoritative magazine, said a firm decision on
developing with U.S. companies a new weapon for Britain was expected
in 1992.
   ``The plan is likely to attract criticism from the opposition
United Kingdom Labor Party, the Soviet Union and others who consider
its development inopportune in the present East-West climate,''
Jane's said.
   The magazine said Boeing Aerospace Co. was competing with Martin
Marietta for the British contract.
   Boeing has proposed a variation of its Short Range Attack Missile
II being developed for the U.S. Air Force. Martin Marietta has
signed an agreement to investigate adapting its Supersonic
Low-Altitude Target being developed for the U.S. Navy, Jane's said.

   Trying to find the right McKay can be a wee
problem in the Scottish Highlands village of Farr.
   But Ann Allan came up with a solution: a separate telephone book
for the district, complete with first names.
   Of the district's 600 residents, there are about 200 McKays or
Mackays.
   ``This is what they call `Mackay Country,' there are so many of
them,'' the former innkeeper said. ``It's amazing how many Mackays
are here.''
   Previously, Farr and the 12 surrounding villages in its district
on mainland Scotland's most northern coast had to use the British
Telecom's Highlands and Islands directory, which lists more than
2,000 Mackays, mostly only by first initial. British telephone books
usually do not list first names.
   Mrs. Allan has come up with a new, 12-page Farr and District
Directory, which sells for about $2.25, with the proceeds going to
help buy equipment at the local medical practice.
   The directory even lists middle names.
   ``There are a lot of double names up here _ Willie John, Angus
John,'' she said. ``We list names as fully as possible, except for
the ladies of course _ they might get funny phone calls.''

<HEAD>Tehran Radio Hints Relations With Britain May Improve</HEAD>

   Tehran radio indicated Thursday the
British High Court's decision allowing Moslems to challenge
Britain's blasphemy laws may help ease tension between the countries
over ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In the first Iranian reaction to the High Court ruling Monday,
the official radio said the move ``could perhaps be considered as a
step aimed at correcting previous stances.''
   Also on Thursday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
said in Moscow the death sentence imposed on British author Salman
Rushdie for writing ``The Satanic Verses'' still is in force,
despite the death of Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini.
   The sentence, issued by Khomeini, was based on Islamic law, and
``this is not the kind of prescription that can be reversed. There
is no one in Iran who could reverse it,'' Ransanjani told a news
conference after two days of talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The death sentence, issued Feb. 14, sent Rushdie into hiding and
led to a break in relations between Britain and Iran.
   In Britain, the Moslem Action Group had sought to prosecute
Rushdie, but a court refused to issue summonses on grounds Britain's
law of blasphemy applies only to Christians.
   On Monday, Britain's High Court granted Abdal Choudhury, a
spokesman for the Moslem Action Group, permission to challenge the
lower court's decision.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said: ``It seems that in view
of the fact that everyone has conceded that the book is insulting
... and in view of the harm that has been done to that country's
reputation and political standing due to its irrational support for
`The Satanic Verses,' London's conservative government now finds it
appropriate to revise its policies.''
   Many Moslems consider ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemous. British
officials also have conceded that the book contained material that
could be offensive but said this was no excuse for Khomeini to
``incite murder.''

<HEAD>Administration Criticized on Sanctions for Chemical, Biological Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators criticized the Bush administration on
Thursday for failing to advocate harsh sanctions against foreign
companies that spread chemical and biological weapons.
   ``You don't have a policy position,'' Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,
said in response to testimony from Reginald Bartholomew,
undersecretary of State for security assistance. Bartholomew
appeared before the Banking Committee's subcommittee on
international finance.
   Bartholomew told the subcommittee the administration would
support some sanctions, with the president having the authority to
say when they would be used.
   But he said he opposed sanctions for past actions and said the
use of U.S. sanctions outside the United States would violate
international law. Joan McEntee, undersecretary of Commerce for
export administration, said power to impose additional sanctions is
not needed.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa, accused the administration of having a
double standard, pointing out that the actions Bush has taken
against China for the killing of demonstrators are not based on
international law.
   ``What your are saying is that if a commercial party is involved,
they deserve to be treated better than the butchers of Beijing,'' he
said. ``If that's your position, it's very hard for us to accept
it.''
   Heinz is co-author with Sen. Robert Dole,R-Kan, the Senate
minority leader, of a bill that calls for curbing exports to the
United States from companies that help countries get chemical or
biological weapons.
   He insisted on the need for Congress to prod the administration
to take action on trade matters.
   ``The record is that when we've taken strong action, we've gotten
results,'' Heinz said. ``When we've done nothing, nothing happened.
Toshiba is one example.
   ``And I've got to tell you, in my judgment it took the
legislative equivalent of half a dozen atomic bombs to wake the
(west) German government up on the Imhausen sale. First time they
looked at it, what did they say? `Huh, it couldn't happen here'...
   ``Have you got any examples that say keeping this stuff quiet and
doing nothing succeeds?''
   In the Toshiba case a subsidiary of the Japanese company sold the
Soviet Union machines that could have been useful in protecting
Soviet submarines from detection by U.S. forces. A law approved by
former President Reagan curbed sales in this country by both the
subsidiary and the parent company.
   The Imhausen firm is accused of helping Libya build a plant to
make poison gas. The West German government has acted against the
company.
   ``Senator, you may be right in those specific cases,''
Bartholomew replied.
   ``But if we here in the United States pass a law which
automatically, without discretion, mandates sanctions where the
operations of foreign companies are concerned, we are concerned that
the reaction of foreign governments will be that it is their
business to police their companies. It is their cooperation that we
want.''
   Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., called the answers the worst he
had heard in 15 years of experience in Congress.
   ``I get the impression you don't feel the sense of urgency all
over the country,'' he said.
   Bartholomew replied that the question was getting at least the
priority in the Bush administration that it is getting in the Senate.

<HEAD>Journalists Accuse Military of Violating Press Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sudanese Journalists' Union on
Thursday accused security authorities of violating press freedom by
detaining six journalists and shutting down two newspapers, an
independent newspaper reported.
   The daily Al-Usbua also reported that one of the detained
journalists had relayed an offer from Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi for
ousted President Gaafar Nimeiri to end his exile in Egypt and return
home as a civilian.
   Al-Usbua said newspaper editor Sidahmed Khalifa met with Mahdi
before traveling to Egypt to interview Nimeiri, and suggested the
former military dictator be allowed home. It said Mahdi agreed, a
statement the president denies.
   In Cairo, Nimeiri said Khalifa had relayed a verbal offer from
Mahdi to ``return to Sudan and work and talk and criticize the
political situation.'' Nimeiri said he had welcomed Mahdi's
invitation, but would have preferred it in writing.
   Mahdi denied he granted Khalifa permission to invite Nimeiri
back. He told the Constituent Assembly, Sudan's parliament, that he
told Khalifa he would hold the editor responsible if the interview
with Nimeiri was against the national interests of the government.
   The alleged invitation reportedly was delivered several weeks
before the military command disclosed Sunday an abortive coup
attempt by Nimeiri supporters. Nimeiri says the report was
fabricated to distract Sudanese from the country's myriad problems.
   Four journalists have been arrested and one newspaper closed down
in connection with the reported coup attempt.
   Yusuf Shanbali, secretary-general of the Sudanese Journalists'
Union, said the government should use the courts, not detentions and
indefinite bans, to prosecute journalists accused of misconduct.
   ``We appreciate the critical circumstances, but this does not
justify trangressing the freedom of the press,'' Shanbali said.
``The union rejects any breach of the freedom of the press.''
   Press freedom did not exist here during Nimeiri's 16 years in
power. Since his defense minister overthrew him in 1985, however,
the government has rid itself of all media organs except the
national news agency and official radio and TV stations.
   The first significant media restriction under the current
civilian government came in spring when the army banned reports of
military actions in the south, where rebels fighting for more
autonomy had captured key towns.
   One newspaper, the biweekly Al-Rai, apparently was singled out
for ignoring the embargo on military news. It was shut down in
February and its editor, Mohammed Medani Tawfik, was arrested.
   After Sunday's coup plot announcement, security authorities
arrested editor-in-chief Khalifa and closed his triweekly Al-Wattan,
which had published a series of interviews with Nimeiri.
   Also detained this week were Salah Mattar, a journalist with the
independent daily Al-Khartoum and three other reporters from
Al-Wattan and Al-Rai.

<HEAD>Congress Told Out-of-Staters Trashing Ohio, Buckeyes Are ``Truly
Engaged''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress was told Thursday that out-of-staters
are trashing Ohio, leaving Buckeyes ``truly enraged'' about having
tons of garbage heaped on them by their neighboring states.
   An Ohio official, saying ``we could become the next New Jersey in
just a few years,'' urged Congress to slap a $40-a-ton fee on
long-haul garbage to discourage interstate trafficking in trash.
   ``We simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become the
East Coast's dumping ground,'' Richard Sahli, chairman of the Ohio
Solid Waste Management Advisory Council, told a House subcommittee.
   Donald Deieso, assistant commissioner of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection, said ``we understand
completely'' the concerns of states gaining garbage, since New
Jersey had been a dump for New York and Pennsylvania. He suggested
Congress order every state to become self-sufficient.
   Ohio last year took in 2.4 million tons of out-of-state waste,
double what came in the previous year. Nearly 20 percent of the
waste disposed of in Ohio is generated elsewhere and the heap is
growing, Sahli told the transportation and hazardous materials
subcommittee.
   Landfills are filling up or being closed because of pollution
problems, Sahli said.
   ``We in Ohio have a home-grown crisis on our hands,'' he said.
``The importing of wastes has truly enraged the citizens of Ohio.''
   ``We're the dumping ground,'' agreed Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
chairman of the subcommittee.
   Witnesses said Ohio isn't alone.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said 15,000 landfills have
closed over the past 10 years, leaving about 5,000 nationwide. All
of Florida's landfills must close within 10 years because of threats
to groundwater, the environmental group added.
   Paul Templet, secretary of the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality, said that state is down to 40 landfills,
compared with 800 in operation in 1980.
   ``Solid waste management in Louisiana has reached crisis
proportions,'' said Templet, who asked the subcommittee to consider
a national recycling program and strict landfill guidelines.
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said his state has been
``victimized by the lack of federal policy'' on solid waste.
   ``States like mine are virtually unprotected,'' he told the panel.
   Richardson asked the panel to consider his bill giving states the
right to reject the interstate transfer of solid waste.
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said he was introducing legislation
to treat trash the same way the government treats low-level
radioactive waste. His bill would force states to develop regional
compacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively.
   The Ohio official asked the panel to tax garbage sent long
distances and then use the money to encourage recycling and to
increase Environmental Protection Agency funding for developing
better ways of handling solid waste.
   ``Such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care of
their own waste disposal needs and not create devastating economic
dislocation and potential environmental problems in communities
located hundreds of miles away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Jaruzelski Protests Held</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people demonstrated in four
cities on Thursday to protest the expected candidacy of Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski for the new post of president.
   About 3,500 people rallied in Wroclaw in southwestern Poland and
from 100 to 150 in the port of Gdansk, Poznan to the west and
Katowice in the south, organizers and the state-run PAP news agency
said.
   On Wednesday, at least 3,000 demonstrators in Krakow chanted
``Soviets go home!'' and marched by the Soviet Consulate and
Communist Party headquarters, were some protesters hurled coins that
broke windows.
   Organizers said police officers watched the demonstrations and
did not intervene.
   The Wroclaw protest was organized by supporters of the banned
Fighting Solidarity and the Polish Socialist Party, said a
spokeswoman for the groups, Maria Pinior.
   The protesters denounced Jaruzelski and laid wreaths at a
symbolic monument to victims of China's crackdown on dissent.
   In Gdansk, about 150 people chanted ``Jaruzelski must go!'' and
marched to the party headquarters, which they sprayed with slogans,
said a witness.
   PAP said Fighting Solidarity organized the Poznan and Katowice
demonstrations and that protesters shouted slogans ``insulting'' to
Jaruzelski and the Soviet Union.
   Organizers said the protests will continue in various cities
until Poland's new National Assembly votes on the presidency. The
election is expected before President Bush begins a state visit July
9.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Communist Party, is expected
to be nominated by the party.
   The presidency was created as part of the reforms negotiated by
the Solidarity-backed opposition and the government earlier this
year.
   Solidarity was legalized after a seven-year ban and participated
in the parliamentary elections held this month.
   Candidates backed by the trade union won all but one of the seats
available to the opposition. But the party appears to have enough
votes to elect Jaruzelski president.

   A woman accused of ``shopping around'' at
nurseries for a baby to steal was convicted Thursday of killing a
couple she had stalked for days, snatching their 9-day-old son and
trying to pass him off as her own.
   Jurors who found Joyce Lynch guilty on all counts meet Friday to
begin deciding whether she should be executed by lethal injection or
sentenced to life in prison without probation or parole.
   Mrs. Lynch, 36, had accused her husband, Richard, of killing
Beverly and Joseph Gibson Jr. on Christmas Eve 1987, drugging her
and duping her into believing that she had given birth. Lynch, 27,
faces a trial in September.
   Both were charged with two counts of murder, two counts of felony
murder, one count of conspiracy and one count each of possession of
a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, burglary and
unlawful imprisonment.
   The state contends the Lynches shot the Gibsons and took
9-day-old Matthew Gibson because Mrs. Lynch could no longer have
children.
   Prosecutors accused them of ``shopping around'' at nurseries
``until they stumbled upon Matthew Gibson.''
   ``They hunted the Gibsons down, stalked them for at least a week
and murdered them to get that child,'' Deputy Attorney General
William Nicholas said during closing arguments Wednesday in Kent
County Superior Court.
   During 16 days of testimony, the defense portrayed Mrs. Lynch as
a victim of her husband. She claimed Lynch controlled her by
injecting her with overdoses of a prescription pain-killer she
needed for a back ailment.
   Mrs. Lynch, who had two children from a previous marriage, also
claimed her husband duped her into believing she was pregnant, and
told her she had given birth to Matthew while she was asleep.
   She said she was at the crime scene, but because she was heavily
drugged, she thought it was a dream. When she awakened, there was a
baby.
   The state contended she was the mastermind because she knew she
had had a hysterectomy in 1978.
   Gibson, 32, was found in a pool of blood by his then-5-year-old
daughter, Rebecca, and 1-year-old son, John Gregory.
   Mrs. Gibson, 27, was found slumped over the steering wheel of her
car, clutching the cloth diaper she used when burping Matthew.
   The prosecution said one of the Lynches took Matthew from her
arms. Matthew was with the Lynches when they were arrested Jan. 7,
1988. Matthew and his brother and sister have been raised by their
paternal grandparents.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired U.S. Air Force colonel said
Thursday he had made a solo flight over the North Pole in a
single-engine plane.
   Charles Mack said he flew from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Helsinki
in 19 hours, 58 minutes, and claimed a world record for the solo
2,970-mile flight in his Beechcraft Bonanza BE-36. There was no
independent verification.
   Officials at Helsinki's airport said Mack landed about 7 p.m.,
but they did not know were he came from.
   Mack, 68, of Hollywood, Fla., said he planned the trip for
midsummer so he could use the arctic's seasonal 24-hour sunlight to
help him navigate. He said he had to make adjustments to his
gyro-compass every 20 minutes to keep from straying off course.
   He also navigated by sun sightings, a sun dial and radio
direction-finding equipment.
   ``I chose Helsinki from Point Barrow to Helsinki because it's a
straight line over the North Pole,'' he said. ``If I went to Sweden,
then somebody could say I went beside the North Pole.''
   Mack said he flew over ice for most of the trip and said clouds
often blocked his view, but he made some videotapes. He flew near
the west end of Spitzbergen island and over Finland to Helsinki in
the Beechcraft.
   He had planned to fly at 160 mph at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000
feet.
   Mack, a former fighter pilot, said he has more than 14,000 hours
of flight time, including solo flights from Paris to New York and
back.
   He left south Florida on June 13 and plans to return via Paris,
Iceland and New York next month.

<TEXT>
   President Najib on Thursday convened
the first military review meeting since the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and said the goverment needs ``a new tempo and dramatic
steps'' to fight the guerrillas.
   ``It is too early to talk about final victory,'' Najib told
members of the 22-member Supreme Defense Council and military
commanders from Afghanistan's 28 provinces. ``We should think in
terms of how to get rid of the imposed war and put an end to it.''
   Western journalists were invited to attend the inauguration of
the meeting, held a day after Kabul announced it had a broken a
15-week rebel siege of the eastern city of Jalalabad. Guerrillas
based in Pakistan denied the claim.
   The lifting of the siege would represent the biggest military
victory for the government since the last Soviet troops withdrew in
February, ending their nine-year involvement in Afghanistan.
   The military review was the first since the Soviet withdrawal,
and diplomats say it was called to plan a new strategy against the
rebels.
   Najib used the occasion to renew attacks on Pakistan, which
supports the Moslem guerrillas fighting Najib's Soviet-backed
government.
   ``The grave dangers emanating from the satanic plans of Pakistan
... pose a serious threat to peace, security and stability in the
region,'' he said.
   The president also said Washington and other rebel supporters
``did not want to stop the war, they want to continue the
bloodshed.''

<HEAD>Forest Service Chief Say Owl Data Too Skimpy to Reduce Logging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too little is known about the spotted owl to
justify closing off vast portions of the ancient forests of the
Northwest to logging, the head of the U.S. Forest Service said
Thursday.
   ``I don't think we ought to penalize the people of the Northwest,
throw people out of work, close down towns, until a biological
decision can be made properly,'' F. Dale Robertson, chief of the
Forest Service, said as two House subcommittees wrapped up two days
of joint hearings.
   Robertson said his agency has begun a five-year study of the owl,
which is thought to nest only in the old-growth forests of
Washington state, Oregon and northern California.
   He said there was insufficient scientific on the owl to justify a
50 percent reduction in the timber harvest from the national forests
of the Northwest this year.
   A federal judge in Seattle has enjoined the agency from offering
162 timber sales planned during the current fiscal year in those
forests involving 1.4 billion board feet.
   Robertson said that represents roughly 25 percent of the timber
sale program scheduled this year and said the injunction might be
expanded so it would eventually affect sales involving 2.5 billion
board feet or half of the sales planned in the region.
   The injunction was sought by environmentalists who want to have
the owl protected as a threatened or endangered species as part of
their campaign to halt logging in the old-growth forests of the
Northwest. The timber industry has claimed such protection would
create an economic catastrophe for dozens of one-mill towns in the
region.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed the owl for
listing as a threatened species, but it will take between 18 months
and two years before a final decision is made.
   The hearings were held by the national parks and public lands
subcommittee of the House Interior Committee and the forests, family
farms and energy subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee.
   Robertson said that 60 percent of the timber available for
harvest in western Oregon and Washington was old-growth, much of it
prime habitat for the spotted owl.
   Robertson faced harsh criticism from Oregon Democratic Rep. Peter
DeFazio, who charged the Forest Service had done little since the
injunction was issued four months ago to soften its impact on the
region.
   ``Are you trying to precipitate a crisis in the hope that
Congress will bail you out?'' DeFazio asked, adding that the agency
has yet to appeal the injunction and took two months before it
responded to a letter he wrote asking if there were alternative
sales that could be offered quickly.

   Labor representatives at South Korea's
second largest shipyard Thursday rejected a 20 percent pay increase
negotiated by their union leaders, dimming prospects for the
debt-stricken business.
   Managers of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Co. at Okpo,
off the south coast, threatened to shut down the facility if workers
strike.
   Company and labor union leaders had reached a tentative agreement
to give the 13,000 workers an average 20 percent pay rise from Jan.
1 next year.
   But the union's 54-member executive committe turned down the
agreement by a vote of 28-26. Hard-line union leaders demanded an
immediate increase.
   Yard workers earn an average $525 a month and company officials
say large wage increases would put the shipyard out of business.
   Workers demanded a 53 percent pay raise May 9. Management
responded with a wage freeze and threatened to close the yard.
   The shipyard at Koje island was virtually shut down May 29, when
two workers died after setting themselves on fire in protest.
   The trouble started two months after the government deployed
police and used strongarm tactics that left hundreds of people
injured to end a prolonged strike at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the
country's largest shipyard.
   Government officials have urged Daewoo workers and company
officials to continue negotiating and suspended a $600 million
rescue package for the yard, which is about $1.6 billion in debt.
   Daewoo had to raise another $600 million on its own.
   The shipyard opened in 1981 and can build up to 1.2 million tons
of shipping a year _ 30 percent of the country's combined
shipbuilding capacity.
   Daewoo has a backlog of foreign orders worth $1.17 billion.

   The African National Congress said Thursday
three of its officials were wounded in a bomb blast in Lusaka, and
it accused South Africa of starting a new terror campaign.
   Wednesday night's blast in Lusaka was the fourth bombing this
week in the Zambian capital, said ANC spokesman Tom Sebina.
   One official of the guerrrilla organization was seriously injured
in the latest explosion, which destroyed an ANC welfare office, he
said.
   ``A new phase of bombings and assassinations by South African
agents appears to have begun and we are stepping up our security,''
Sebina said.
   In the worst incident, two bombs near the ANC headquarters in
downtown Lusaka damaged a gasoline station and killed one man on
Monday. Police said they believe the victim was carrying the bomb
that killed him.
   No one was killed in the other blasts.
   The ANC, the main guerrilla organization fighting Pretoria's
white-run government, is banned in South Africa and has its
headquarters-in-exile in Lusaka.
   In recent years, ANC facilities in black-governed nations
neighboring South Africa have become regular targets of Pretoria's
military and sabotage attacks.
   Sebina said that after a lull of several months the latest
bombings may have been carried out by a group of agents believed to
have infiltrated Zambia recently.
   One of the aims of South African sabotage is ``to create
conditions whereby our host governments will become jittery about
our presence,'' he said.

<HEAD>American, Delta Drop Reservations System Merger</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial circuits.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   American Airlines and Delta Air Lines on
Thursday dropped plans to merge their computer reservation systems
because the Justice Department threatened to sue to block the $2
billion joint venture.
   ``The likely result of this transaction would be higher fares and
poorer service for airline passengers,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in a statement announcing the department's intention
to file a civil antitrust suit.
   Delta spokesman William Berry announced that the two carriers had
given up trying to merge their computer then said, ``We decided it
would take too much time to fight this in court.
   American operates Sabre, the leading system among the five used
by practically all airlines and travel agents. Delta's system is
Datas II, the smallest of the CRS _ for computer reservation system
_ ventures.
   ``We feel that Justice is wrong,'' Berry said. ``We really were
surprised. We felt that this partnership was giving the government
what it wanted, in terms of taking the (reservation) systems out of
the ownership of individual airlines, making it an autonomous
company.''
   Said Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of American:
``While the decision clearly means that we cannot create a joint
venture with another domestic airline that sponsors a competing CRS,
we will continue to offer partnership interests in Sabre to domestic
airlines which do not sponsor a competing CRS, to foreign airlines
and to other interested companies.''
   The computer systems provide up-to-the minute information on
video screens about schedules, fares, seat availability, hotels, car
rentals and package vacations. They allow users to make reservations
and issue tickets in seconds, and are the primary channel for the
distribution of tickets.
   The systems give airlines the practically instantaneous data on
seat sales that lets the carriers quickly change prices, blackout
dates, advance purchase requirements and other conditions that form
their ``yield management'' strategies.
   American's Sabre had $445 million in fee revenues and
approximately 41 percent of the national market in 1988, the Justice
Department said. Delta's 7-year-old Datas II is the youngest system,
with about $68 million in revenues and approximately 7 percent of
the market.
   The three other systems are joint operations of United and USAir,
TWA and Northwest, and Eastern and Continental.
   In 1986, travel agents paid about $287 million in fees to the
systems and airlines paid $600 million, the department said.
   Thornburgh said the lawsuit would allege that the joint venture
would violate the Clayton and the Sherman acts because it likely
would substantially lessen competition both in the sale of services
to travel agents and in the provision of scheduled airline passenger
service.
   ``Travel agents using a particular CRS tend to sell a
disproportionately high number of tickets on that CRS owner's
airline,'' said Judy L. Whalley, acting assistant attorney general
in the antitrust division.
   Since 1986, airlines have been forbidden to favor their own
flights in the computer display listings.
   Berry said his company and American intended to sell up to 50
percent of the merged system to other airlines and already had
received expressions of interest from Alaska, Southwest, Lufthansa
and more than a dozen other carriers.
   ``Last week, we became aware that Justice felt it had a problem
with this partnership,'' Berry said. ``We attempted to resolve it.
There was really nothing we could do.''

UPDATE with Bush, Fitzwater comments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III appealed
to members of Congress on Thursday to back the measured response of
the Bush administration to abuses of human rights in China, and the
House responded with a unanimous show of support.
   But Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine called
for a more forceful renunciation of the executions being carried out
despite an appeal by President Bush to Chinese leaders to show
clemency.
   Mitchell, in a floor speech, said he understood ``the delicate
situation in which the president finds himself.'' And, the majority
leader said, ``I support the stated desire to maintain, if possible,
some relationship with the Chinese government.''
   But, Mitchell said, ``I ask _ I urge _ the president to condemn
these acts personally and in the strongest possible terms, to give
voice to the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the American
people.''
   Bush, meanwhile, told a luncheon in New York City ``we're all
very concerned'' about developments in China. Later, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the president against Mitchell's
charges.
   ``We feel the administration has spoken out loudly, strongly and
without reservation on this issue,'' Fitzwater said. ``We've spoken
out forcefully, more than any other country in the world. Our words
speak for themselves. There's no need to repeat different words
every day of the week.''
   Asked specifically to react to the latest wave of executions,
Fitzwater said, ``There's a great sense of sadness and
disappointment that world opinion has not had an influence on the
actions of the Chinese.''
   Twenty-seven people reportedly have been executed in China.
Thousands have been arrested as authorities extend their crackdown
on advocates of a more liberal communist system.
   Baker, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
said the United States was first among the countries around the
world to respond to the assault on students June 3-4 in Tiananmen
Square.
   ``What we have done is to take carefully targeted actions without
being inflammatory in our rhetoric and preserving options for the
future,'' he said.
   That approach, Baker said, ``doesn't necessarily extend to
others.''
   But while he recognized Congress might want to take a different
stance, Baker said ``in the past when we have not spoken with one
voice in the conduct of our foreign policy we've almost always
failed.''
   Therefore, Baker urged Congress to bank its fire and recognize
that the U.S. relationship with the People's Republic of China,
carefully cultivated over the past 15 years, had other
considerations besides human rights.
   ``I think we should act and speak in one voice, and act in a
coordinated way to address this very, very difficult foreign policy
problem,'' he said.
   The House later voted 416-0 for a non-binding resolution
condemning the ``murderous crackdown and brutal repression of the
pro-democracy movement'' and supporting Bush's call for clemency for
demonstrators.
   ``This is an issue on which there is no disagreement in this
House or among the American people,'' said the measure's sponsor,
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``It is essential now for us
to tell the Chinese government that there can be no business as
usual as long as they continue brutal repression of their own
people.''
   Before the vote, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told
reporters, ``I would like to see the Congress and the president
stand together on these issues, and I do not favor actions that
aren't taken in consultation with the administration.''
   Foley added that ``the stand that has been taken is very clear''
and said additional sanctions could lead to ``a complete breach'' in
U.S.-China relations while having no positive effect.
   ``That will not accomplish anything that I can see for the
benefit of the democracy movement in China, or for the individual
rights of Chinese students, and I think we ought to keep some
concern about the maintenance of the relationship.''
   Bush's initial response to the shootings in Tiananmen Square was
to suspend U.S. military transactions and contacts with China. Then,
as the suppression continued, he withheld U.S. support for
international loans to Beijing and prohibited visits by senior
adinistration officials.
   ``I believe we have made it abundantly clear, both what we said
and in our actions, that while they may be able to clear the Square
they won't be able to clear their conscience,'' Baker said of the
Chinese leaders.
   Mitchell, citing fresh news reports that seven more ``rioters''
had been put to death, said Bush was more reticent than other world
figures in denouncing the Chinese government.
   The senator said the leaders of Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
France and Japan had made statements more forceful than Bush, who
deplored the attack in Tiananman Square and said he admired the
protesters.
   ``I ask him not to refuse to answer questions about these
matters,'' Mitchell said, ``but to step forward voluntarily to speak
out. ... I urge the president to assume the proper role as the
spokesman for the American people, as the leader of the free world,
to condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms.''
   Baker said his view had been misunderstood as protective only of
U.S. economic and commercial ties with the world's most populous
nation.
   Actually, he said, U.S. policy must consider geopolitical ties.
``There are countervailing considerations,'' he said.
   Baker was confronted by calls from members of the committee for
the administration to go beyond the sanctions imposed against China
to stronger measures and more consistent denunciation of arrests and
executions.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said he and other lawmakers were
planning to propose a package of sanctions against China tougher
than Bush's suspension of military and diplomatic visits and U.S.
arms transactions.
   Solarz, who met this week with Chinese Ambassador Han Xu, did not
elaborate.
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., urged Baker to keep in mind
Neville Chamberlain, the pre-World War II prime minister of Britain
whom many historians accuse of pursuing a failed policy of
appeasement toward Adolf Hitler.
   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said he was exhilarated by the
administration's ``splendid performance.'' But he advised Baker to
denounce the executions with an outrage that `'the Chinese and the
people of the world would hear.''
   Two senior members of the committee, Reps. William S. Broomfield,
R-Mich., and Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., supported the administration's
approach.
   Broomfield said the president was doing his job properly, and
Hamilton told Baker, ``I think you have handled the China problem
very well.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said the United States
``would respond appropriately if China halts repressive actions that
are souring its relations with the West.''
   In a speech to an Asian Policy Conference sponsored by the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, Quayle
said the United States has a duty ``to denounce the brutal
suppression of popular and peaceful demonstrations in China ... to
condemn the Orwellian inversion of truth'' about the slaying of
civilian demonstrators in Beijing.

   The Supreme Court added Thursday to a string of
defeats for civil rights forces with a decision that gives cities
new protection against certain lawsuits accusing them of racial bias
and other violations.
   Voting 5-4, the justices used the case of a former Dallas high
school football coach to narrow the scope of a century-old civil
rights law. The coach said he was transferred to another school
because he is white.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the 1866
law can be used to sue a city only if it can be proved the alleged
violation of civil rights was part of an official municipal policy.
   It is not enough to show that a city employee, acting in an
official capacity, violated someone's rights, she said.
   ``Once those officials who have the power to make official policy
on a particular issue have been identified, it is for the jury to
determine whether their decisions have caused the deprivation of
rights at issue by policies which affirmatively command that it
occur,'' she said.
   The high court previously limited a civil rights law enacted in
1871 _ a statute also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act _ in the same
way.
   Thursday's ruling is particularly significant because of the
potential big-money damages the 1866 law provides for winners of
such suits.
   The ruling is the latest in a series of defeats handed civil
rights plaintiffs this year by a newly solidified conservative
majority on the court.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
latest decision is ``astonishing'' because the court did not allow
pro-civil rights forces to present their side fully.
   ``It is not only unfair to decide the case on this basis,'' he
said. ``It is unwise.''
   The court ruled against Norman Jett, longtime coach and athletic
director at South Oak Cliff High School in Dallas. He sued the
Dallas Independent School District and others.
   A federal jury awarded Jett $850,000 in damages, reduced by a
federal trial judge to about $563,000. A federal appeals court
overturned the award.
   The Supreme Court said Thursday that Jett could get a new trial
to determine whether he can recover any money from the school
district.
   But the decision makes his case considerably more difficult to
prove.
   O'Connor said a federal appeals court could grant Jett a new
trial against the city only if it determines that the school
superintendent who ordered him transferred had policy-making
authority granted by Texas law in the area of employee transfers.
   Jett had coached the South Oak Cliff football team since 1962
when, in the spring of 1983, he was transferred to another city high
school.
   Jett had been named head coach and athletic director at the
school in 1970, the year the racial composition at South Oak Cliff
changed from predominantly white to predominantly black.
   Frederick Todd, South Oak Cliff's black principal who held that
job since 1975, was also sued by Jett for replacing him with a black
coach.
   According to court records, the relationship between Todd and
Jett grew more tense after South Oak Cliff lost to Plano in the
state high school championship in November 1982.
   Jett said Todd believed that the only way for South Oak Cliff to
compete was to hire a black coach who in turn would recruit black
players.
   Jett said that school officials violated his due-process,
free-speech and equal-protection rights.
   Brennan was joined in dissent by Justices Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Joining O'Connor were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.

   Women who once knocked on the doors of
all-male clubs to try to crack the good old boys' network formed
their own informal grapevine Thursday to boost members of their sex.
   Members of the Association of Good Old Girls, AGOG, promise never
to make decisions in a locker room, in a bar or on the golf course.
   ``It's fun and it's serious at the same time,'' said Denise
Elliott, who helped found the group.
   Fifteen women gathered amidst exhibits on feminist history at the
Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame for the first
AGOG meeting.
   They raised their right hands and, shouting ``AGOG,'' they
pledged to function as an informal network of women helping other
women climb to the top in their business or profession, just as men
have done by swapping information over drinks or lunch.
   Rachael E. Moreno, a co-founder of the association, said the
women are trying to copy the good old boy network, rather than
dismantle it, because they know it works.
   Boys begin training to join the network when they are youngsters
by taking part in sports that teach cooperation and teamwork, she
said.
   As adults, men holding top positions socialize with each other
and learn about job openings, business opportunities and promotion
possibilities, she said.
   ``That's the topic of their social interaction and because there
are so few women in similar positions it's very difficult for women
to have access to those same pieces of information,'' she said.
   Any man or woman who is willing to help women get ahead is a
member in good standing of AGOG, said Moreno, who dreamed up the
name because she liked the meaning of ``agog'' _ intense excitement.
   Moreno, an associate superintendent of Genesee Intermediate
School District, said women already are giving each other a helping
hand up the corporate level.
   ``From whatever position I hold or whatever organization I belong
to, I make sure women have the opportunity to participate, to be
promoted, to have some visibility and most of all to learn from real
experiences, learn about leadership,'' she said.
   But she said the good old girls network needs the extra
visibility that a semi-serious organization like AGOG can give it.
   ``I don't believe that we have the numbers yet because it takes
women in almost every organization, agency and industry in order to
establish that kind of comprehensive network,'' she said.
   The group, which includes women in real estate, higher education
and politics, has a copyright on its name and a logo, three female
stick figures with hands joined. They plan to offer information to
women around the country who want to form their own chapters.

   Plans to attempt an override of Gov. Mario
Cuomo's latest veto of legislation to restore the death penalty in
New York state were scrapped Thursday because of a key senator's
illness.
   New York governors have vetoed death penalty bills every year
since 1977.
   State Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino said the override vote,
which had been expected Tuesday, was being postponed indefinitely
because of new cancer surgery for state Sen. James Donovan.
   Donovan issued a statement saying he would enter Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City on Monday for surgery
Wednesday.
   The bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. Dale Volker, had said
earlier that without Donovan's support he had almost no chance of
winning the override test in the Senate.
   Donovan, 65, who underwent surgery in early May for colon cancer,
went to New York City on Wednesday for tests at Sloan-Kettering.
   A consistent death penalty supporter in the past, Donovan stunned
his colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer had
caused him to have second thoughts about the death penalty.
   On Monday, Donovan had returned to Albany for the first time
since his May surgery and Cuomo sent a state helicopter to Donovan's
home to pick him up for a lengthy lunch at the Executive Mansion.
   Emerging from that lunch, Donovan said he still wasn't certain
how he would vote on the override attempt.
   But he added: ``If you were standing where I am and your life was
in danger, you would have some second thoughts.''
   For the past four years, the Republican-controlled state Senate
has successfully voted to override Cuomo's death penalty vetoes but
the effort has repeatedly fallen short in the Democratic-controlled
Assembly.
   This year, death penalty supporters felt they were within one
vote of winning in the Assembly before problems began appearing in
the Senate.
   In February, state Sen. Israel Ruiz was convicted of a federal
felony that eventually cost him his seat. The Democrat had voted for
the death penalty in recent years.
   With Ruiz gone, Volker could only count on 41 votes for an
override, the exact number needed in the 61-member Senate. And that
assumed that Donovan would vote for the death penalty.
   New York's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963.

<TEXT>
   House Democrats filled a vacancy in their new
leadership lineup Thursday by electing Rep. Vic Fazio of California,
an ethics committee member, to serve as the vice chairman of their
party's caucus organization.
   Fazio defeated Reps. Martin Frost of Texas, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio
and Richard Durbin of Illinois to fill the last vacancy remaining
from the party leadership shake-up triggered by the resignations of
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif.
   Fazio won a majority on the second round of balloting with 147
votes to 74 for Frost and 32 for Kaptur. On the first ballot, it was
Fazio 113, Frost 69, Kaptur 37 and Durbin 34. Durbin dropped out for
the second round.
   With the addition of Fazio, the Democratic-elected leadership
contains no women and no Southerners or members of the
more-conservative wing.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday that the leaders
plan to ``consider some additional appointments that might be made
to broaden participation in the leadership.''
   Following Foley, the top Democratic leaders of the House now are
Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader; William H.
Gray III of Pennsylvania, the majority whip; and Steny H. Hoyer of
Maryland, the caucus chairman.
   Fazio is 10-yar House veteran and a member of the ethics
committee, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, that brought the charges that led to Wright's resignation.
Frost, a member of the House Rules Committee, was among Wright's
defenders.
   Coelho resigned from the House June 15 rather than face an
inquiry into his personal finances such as the one that cost Wright
his speakership. On May 31, Wright announced he was quitting as
speaker and said he planned to resign from the House by the end of
June. Foley was elected speaker on June 6.
   Fazio is also co-chairman of a bipartisan task force studying
changes in the House rules of ethical conduct.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it has
approved a permit for Crop Genetics International, Hanover, Md., to
begin immediate field tests of rice plants containing a genetically
engineered organism to ward off insects.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the tests will be conducted in
Queen Anne's County, Md. Last month the agency approved the
company's plan to test the same genetically altered microorganism in
corn.
   A soil organism, Bacillus thuringiensis, contains a gene for a
protein that becomes toxic when eaten by caterpillars. This gene was
added to a second bacterium, Clavibacter xyli (subspecies
cynodontis), which can live within the rice plant.
   By combining the two, scientists hope rice plants can have
built-in protection against insect pests.

   Leading Politburo reformers, saying the
Communist Party is sharply divided, prepared for a crucial meeting
Friday at which some seek the ouster of centrist party chief Karoly
Grosz.
   Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, considered a reformist challenger
to Grosz, told the state news agency MTI on Thursday that the
Central Committee meeting will be advised to keep on Grosz until a
party congress this fall.
   But he said Friday's session ``may not be able to arrive at
lasting solutions'' on personnel or policy.
   ``In these rapidly changing times, there can be unexpected
factors, and questions may arise concerning the party leaders'' and
makeup of the Politburo, Pozsgay said.
   His remarks follow weeks of increasingly open struggle between
reformers and more orthodox Communists. Grosz has been party general
secretary for only 13 months and seems to have lost the center
ground he sought between the two factions.
   Poszgay and other reformers meanwhile have backed new ``reform
circles'' inside the party and, outside, a Movement for a Democratic
Hungary in anticipation of a possible party split.
   Politburo member Reszoe Nyers told Thursday's Nepszabadsag party
daily that he does not expect a formal split Friday.
   But he admitted that ``personal cooperation'' in top party
echelons has sunk to a minimum.
   ``The party is undoubtedly in crisis because of a lack of
clarification in the concepts of internal trends,'' Nyers said.
``There is no determined core in the party capable of integration,''
he added, blaming ``extreme views'' for the lack of unity.
   Three regional reform groups this week openly called for Grosz's
ouster at Friday's meeting.
   Western analysts following Hungary's rapid embrace of democratic
reforms over the past year say that replacing Grosz before President
Bush's visit next month could damage the image of stability Hungary
seeks in the West.
   Budapest is looking to the Bush visit to cement efforts to gain
badly needed Western aid to restructure the stagnating economy and
help pay off a $17-billion foreign debt.
   But a weekly in western Gyoer city this week quotes a local party
reformer as saying Grosz should go now because he is ``a reformer in
word, and not in deed.''
   Influential party reformists in the southern areas of Csongrad
county and Szeged city issued separate calls for Grosz' replacement.
   The power struggle comes as the party is negotiating with
opposition groups over a timetable and regulations for multiparty
elections to be held by next summer.

   A woman who swallowed four stolen rings
and a diamond necklace pleaded guilty Thursday to charges of theft
and possession of stolen property.
   Linda Riddick, 21, also admitted passing one of the rings. Police
Capt. Thomas Russo said an officer was sent to the woman's home to
pick it up.
   Municipal Judge Golden Johnson postponed sentencing until June 27
to allow prosecutors time to seek a grand jury indictment against
Ms. Riddick, said Pherese Fusco, a court clerk.
   Ms. Riddick told police she swallowed the jewelry June 15 after a
friend told police about a theft of $2,500 in jewelry from her
apartment.
   Ms. Riddick agreed to an X-ray, which revealed the rings and a
chain in the lower part of her stomach, police said. She refused to
have surgery to retrieve them.
   Ms. Riddick also pleaded guilty to possession of drug
paraphernalia and was fined $500. She was released on her own
recognizance.

   The Socialist International suspended
Panama's ruling party Thursday on grounds it rigged elections.
   The 81-member congress of Western socialist parties also said it
deplored the ``bloody repression'' in China and called for an
international conference on the Middle East.
   At the end of a three-day congress, delegates unanimously
approved a Latin American proposal to suspend the Democratic
Revolutionary Party of Gen. Manuel Noriega, the de facto leader of
Panama.
   Delegates condemned the ``manipulation of the electoral process
in Panama and demand that the democratic will of the people is
respected.'' Panama's government said its candidate won the May 7
presidential election, but international the observers alleged
widespread fraud and said the opposition won handily.
   Israel's Labor Party, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
boycotted the meeting after the the Socialist International allowed
members of the Palestine Liberation Organization to attend as
observers.
   ``The PLO should take part in the peace process in the region. An
international peace conference under the auspices of the U.N.
Security Council is urgently needed,'' a congress resolution said.
   Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter has reported secret meetings between
unidentified Israeli Labor Party members and PLO delegates during
the conference.
   In addition, Swedish officials sought to mediate at separate
meetings with PLO delegates and members of Israel's Labor Party, the
junior partner in a coalition led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc.
   ``We can express careful optimism after our talks,'' Swedish
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson told a news conference after the
meetings. He refused to elaborate.
   But PLO delegation leader Yasser Abdrabbou said there has been no
shift in official Israeli positions.
   ``They are still saying no to everything _ no to an international
peace conference, no to the PLO, no to withdrawal (from the occupied
territories),'' Abdrabbou told reporters.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt was re-elected
president of the Socialist International, a post he has held since
1976.
   Brandt said the organization is closely following changes in the
Soviet Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The small
republics, which are claiming broad rights of self-determination,
sent ``consultative'' representatives to the congress along with
other Soviet bloc countries.
   ``All of us wish all the best to the people who are working to
improve society'' in the Baltic republics, Brandt told reporters.
   A congress resolution said: ``The Socialist International
supports the struggle in Central and Eastern Europe, including the
Baltic, for self-determination, democracy and economic and
ecological recovery.''

   Two inmates at the J.B. Gates
Correctional Unit used their skills to get out of prison for four
hours Thursday and attend a wine-and-cheese reception.
   Their only tools were pencils and felt-tip pens.
   Inmates Robert DuBois and Dan Simmonds were special guests at the
formal opening of an art gallery's three-week exhibition of 32
drawings and paintings by Connecticut inmates.
   Prison officials, including Gates Warden Dennis T. Guay, and some
of the families of the inmate-artists also attended the reception at
the Vangarde Gallery.
   ``This is just the thing he might need to get him going in the
right direction again,'' said DuBois' mother, Janice Canning of
Wallingford, who greeted her 22-year-old son with a big hug. ``He's
certainly got the talent.''
   Sticking to a vow she had made not to visit her son in prison if
he got in trouble again, Canning had not seen him since he was
sentenced last October to 18 months for robbery.
   The works on display range from an oil painting of a barnyard
scene and a colored pencil drawing of a tearful boy holding a fluffy
white dog to surrealistic portrayals of prison life and frightening
renderings of skulls and bones, blood and death.
   The inmates, who will get to keep all the proceeds, have priced
the paintings and drawings anywhere from $25 to $4,000, for a copy
of a Rembrandt. The show opened Saturday and two drawings had sold
in the first five days.
   One of Simmonds' works _ a stylized drawing of a dog _ was the
second to be sold. The price was $100.
   ``I wasn't too sure on my work. I didn't know I had the artistic
talent. I was content just having my work be good enough to be
entered in an art gallery,'' said Simmonds, 30, who is serving time
for narcotics possession and is due for release this October.
   Simmonds said drawing has become ``a whole new way of relief for
me. it lets me channel my feelings.''
   Inmates like DuBois and Simmonds have been taking art classes as
part of the 5-year-old Arts in Correction program run by the
private, non-profit Connecticut Prison Association, said Allyson
Holtz, the program's coordinator and one of the inmates' art
teachers.
   Nine professional artists hired by the organization have been
going into nine prisons across the state to provide 12-week courses
on such subjects as drawing, creative writing, dance and music.
   ``It gives us a very therapeutic activity that reduces idle time,
which benefits inmates and staff alike,'' said Doug Kulmacz,
director of volunteer services for the Department of Correction,
which helps fund the program.
   This is the second year an exhibition of inmates' work has been
staged at a private gallery, but the first that any inmates
attended, Holtz said.

<HEAD>FAA Tightens Checks On Electronic Devices, Rejects Outright Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday ordered tighter
screening of cassette recorders, lap-top computers and other
electronic devices on some international flights, but rejected calls
to ban all such items from airliners.
   Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the December
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland had called for the ban
after investigators said plastic explosives concealed in a radio
cassette player destroyed the plane.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, announcing the measures,
indicated a ban would unduly inconvenience passengers and would not
likely be imposed by other nations.
   Skinner said the Federal Aviation Administration measures would
take effect immediately and would include ``more than just turning
on and off'' the equipment. He said inspectors would go through a
series of checks, including possibly opening the devices.
   Skinner said he expected several other countries to announce
similar increased screening.
   British authorities are continuing their investigation into who
planted the bomb on the Pan Am flight.
   Plastic explosives cannot be detected by ordinary X-ray
screening, and the Transporation Department has ordered U.S.
airlines to begin installing equipment that can detect plastic
explosives in luggage at airports throughout the world. Officials
acknowledge it could take two years or more to finish the job.
   The new order applies only to U.S. flights originating in Europe
and the Middle East. It will not affect non-U.S. airlines, U.S.
domestic flights, flights from the United States to Europe or the
Middle East or flights to and from other countries.
   Skinner said the step was the result of consultation with top
transportation officials of other countries. Officials agree, he
said, that increased screening is the most ``acceptable and
effective'' method of dealing with the danger.
   ``It is my firm belief that the option we have selected provides
the proper balance between passenger safety and convenience at this
time,'' Skinner said in a speech to an air freight group.
   The FAA said in a news release that additional time may be
required at airport screening points because of the procedures. Some
airlines already conduct such screening.
   ``If electronic devices are not needed on a particular trip,
passengers should consider leaving them behind,'' the FAA said.
   The step is the lastest in several security measures taken by the
FAA since the Pan Am bombing, including X-ray or physical
examination of all checked baggage, random checks of carry-on bags
and mandatory fines for airline passengers who try to carry weapons
past screening points.

   A young man who lives in a homeless shelter told
President Bush on Thursday that it's more profitable to sell drugs
than work for the minimum wage.
   ``$100 a week, that's no money,'' said 18-year-old Walter. ``I
can make $100 in 15 minutes'' selling drugs.
   Another resident agreed.
   ``Working in McDonald's _ at the minimum wage _ it just doesn't
pay,'' Monique, 20, told Bush after he asked why young people ended
up on the street.
   Bush recently vetoed an increase in the minimum wage from $3.35
an hour to $4.55, saying he'll support an increase to $4.25 an hour
with the stipulation of a lower training wage for new employees.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, met for about 30 minutes with 11
residents of Covenant House, a shelter for homeless youths located
three blocks from Times Square.
   Covenant House asked that the residents be identified only by
their first names.
   ``You don't want to be there,'' Monique told Bush when he asked
about the problems of living on the street. She said she had no home
and had been abused as a child.
   Walter, who said his mother was dead and his father an alcoholic,
also said he had no home.
   Bush asked Walter what he wanted to do with his life. Walter said
he hoped to learn electronics, carpentry or plumbing.
   ``I want a good job _ so I can get a house, a dog, a rabbit and
babies,'' Walter said.
   Mrs. Bush cradled a 3-week-old baby, Crystal, whose mother was a
resident of the shelter, as Bush spoke with the youths.

<TEXT>
   Sidney R. Yates, a 20-term Democratic
congressman from Illinois, received emergency medical attention
Thursday after bumping his knee in the House chamber. He later said
he ``almost fainted because the pain was so intense.''
   Six white-coated members of the congressional medical staff
rushed to the aid of the 79-year-old lawmaker from Chicago at about
12:30 p.m. EDT when he fell forward in a seat after voting on the
House floor.
   They put a blood-pressure cuff on his left arm and what appeared
to be a heart monitor on his chest, and talked to him for about 15
minutes before taking him out of the chamber in a wheelchair. He
said he felt fine, though he was pale, when he left for more
examination at the attending physician's office in the Capitol.
   ``I'm feeling very well,'' he said later by telephone from his
office. ``I voted and I was on my way back, turning up the aisle and
bumped my knee. I almost fainted because the pain was so intense.''
   He said there was no permanent damage to his knee, but he was
keeping an ice pack on it to ease the pain.
   Yates had just participated in a parliamentary vote approving
Wednesday's House work. The vote was followed by brief speeches,
which continued while the emergency crew worked on Yates in a chair
toward the rear of the chamber.

   Drought a year ago bit deeply into the 1988
corn crop but didn't do much damage to the grain that was harvested,
an Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   W. Kirk Miller, administrator of the department's Federal Grain
Inspection Service, said the drought had little impact on the
``quality characteristics'' of last year's corn, including test
weights, moisture and kernel damage.
   The annual report did not include statistics for aflatoxin
content of the 1988 corn harvest. Aflatoxin is a cancer-causing
substance that can result from certain kinds of fungus under drought
stress conditions.
   Some corn harvested last fall had been reported as having high
levels of aflatoxin, prompting fears that the tainted grain could
cause harm in the U.S. food chain.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Confident Bomber Will Perform as Anticipated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon official in charge of testing new
weapons said Thursday he is confident the B-2 bomber, set to be
flown in a few weeks, will perform as anticipated.
   ``I don't see any indications the B-2 can't do what it intends to
do,'' John E. Krings, director of the Defense Department's
Operational Test and Evaluation office, told reporters.
   However, Krings, who is leaving at the end of the month, refused
to discuss whether he thought the B-2, the so-called Stealth, was
worth the money, a question raised by some members of Congress.
   Krings said politicians and defense analysts will have to decide
if they're willing to pay for the bomber.
   Each B-2 bomber is expected to cost over $500 million and there
are plans to build 132 of them. Northrop Corp. is building the plane
at its Palmdale, Calif., plant.
   The plane, described as resembling a ``flying wing'' without
conventional fuselage, is designed to penetrate Soviet borders
without being detected by radar.
   The plane has no sharp angles and relies on the use of
radar-absorbing coatings on its surface, officials have said.
   Krings said the B-2 has not been operationally tested in the
field yet, but individual systems were tried out along the way. The
Air Force says the B-2 will not be deployed before 1991.
   Meantime, Krings defended the record of his office, which has
been criticized by some lawmakers who say it has failed to test
weapons adequately and is too cozy with defense contracting firms.
   Krings said his office had succeeded in forcing the services to
improve the weapons before they are deployed.
   ``The list that didn't go into production because of our
arguments, there were many, but they are sometimes hard to find,''
he said. For instance, some contractors have delayed testing in
order not to fail, he said.
   They say, ``We are delaying because we don't want to fail the
test,'' he said. As an example, he cited the testing of cellular
radios that were postponed for about four months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Female veterans often miss out on benefits for
which they qualify because they have a low opinion of their service
records, witnesses told a House subcommittee Thursday.
   ``They don't see themselves as veterans,'' said retired Rear Adm.
Frances Shea-Buckley, chairwoman of the advisory committee on women
veterans for the Department of Veterans Affairs. ``They feel that
only men are veterans. They say things like `I only served two
years. I didn't go overseas.'''
   Women can get all the benefits available to male veterans as long
as they have spent one year in service, said Dr. Susan Mather, chief
of women's programs for the Department of Veterans Affairs. One
estimate says women make up 4 percent of all veterans.
   Among those benefits are extensive health care opportunities,
educational assistance and housing loans.
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., chairman of the Veterans Affairs
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, called the hearing as
a follow-up to the first hearing on the subject two years ago.
   ``We want to learn what progress has been made during the last
two years in realizing the equitable provision of benefits and
services to women veterans,'' said Evans.
   Linda Caldwell, a military nurse who is chairwoman of the
advisory commission on women veterans in New Jersey, told of a
veterans hospital in her state is ill equipped to give women even
basic service.
   Caldwell said Lyons Veterans Hospital had only men's pajamas, no
personal sanitary supplies and no gynecological clinic for
out-patients.
   She said by contrast, the East Orange VA Hospital, provides women
those basic medical needs.
   ``Not all VA hospitals are created equal in terms of facilities,
supplies or services provided veterans,'' said Caldwell.
   Mather said that in the last six or seven years the attitude of
the government toward female veterans has improved, though ``it may
not have filtered down to every level.''
   Caldwell shared Shea-Buckley's opinion about getting women to
come forward as veterans.
   ``In particular, certain Vietnam era women veterans speak of
being ridiculed by family and friends upon their return to the
United States,'' Caldwell said.
   She said they don't act proud of their service or use it to gain
benefits rightfully theirs.
   ``When pressed for details, they often reply, `I'd rather forget
that part of my life,''' she said.
   She said World War II veterans are most vocal about their needs,
primarily nursing care since they are now among the aging population.
   The 1980 Census, the first to ask women if they were veterans,
counted 1.13 million women had served in the armed forces. That was
3.1 percent of the veteran population. Female veterans' now are
believed to comprise about 4 percent of the veteran population, said
Mather.

   President Bush said Thursday he will nominate
businessman John D. Macomber as president of the Export-Import Bank
and Eugene Kristler Lawson as first vice president.
   The White House press office, meanwhile, said it botched an
announcement Wednesday on the nomination of Victor Stello Jr. for a
top Energy Department job.
   Stello, who has been executive director for operations at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 1986, was selected for the post
of assistant secretary for defense programs, replacing Troy Wade.
This is one of the most sensitive jobs in the department because its
holder oversees the nuclear weapons program that currently is
paralyzed by mechanical breakdowns and safety problems.
   The earlier White House announcement said Stello was chosen to be
assistant secretary for nuclear energy, replacing Theodore J.
Garrish. The press office said Thursday it had no explanation for
the mistake.
   No one has been nominated yet to replace Garrish, according to
the Energy Department.
   Macomber, who graduated from Yale in 1950 two years behind Bush,
is chairman of J.D. Macomber and Co., an investment firm, and is
former chairman and chief executive officer of Celanese Corp.
   Lawson is a deputy undersecretary of labor.
   The Ex-Im bank appointments were announced by the press office
during Bush's visit to New York to launch a national service
initiative. The agency helps U.S. manufacturers market goods
overseas.
   The White House said Bush also intends to nominate:
   _Richard Burleson Stewart as assistant attorney general for lands
and natural resources. He is currently a Harvard law professor who
also teaches at the Kennedy School of Government.
   _Lou Gallegos as assistant secretary of the interior for policy,
budget and administration. He is a human services aide to New Mexico
Gov. Carrey E. Carruthers.
   _Thomas    Stephen J. Cannell, the creator and producer of hit TV series
such as ``The A-Team,'' ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Rockford Files,'' and
``Wiseguy,'' said most independent producers would be forced out of
business if the regulation was repealed. Network TV producers make
their money in syndication.
   Cannell said the restraints on the networks encourage
competition, and without them several popular programs such as ``All
in the Family'' and ``The Cosby Show'' may never have been aired.
   ``We are forced to live in an oligopoly with three dominant
corporations,'' he said. ``But at least we can go from one to the
other in our search for a home for our product.''

   A congress of 81 Western socialist parties said
Thursday it deplored the ``bloody repression'' in China. Belgium
protested by banning all official visits and by suspending a loan.
   The Vatican roundly attacked the executions in China, and Spain's
parliament said that death does not block ideas.
   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
urged President Bush to condemn the executions in China more
forcefully. Secretary of State James A. Baker III asked Congress,
however, to mute criticism of administration reaction, saying the
United States must ``speak with one voice.''
   Chinese authorities executed seven more people on Thursday,
bringing to 27 the number reported put to death in two days. Others
have been sentenced to die on charges they led student protests for
democratic reform in April and May.
   Condemnation from the Socialist International came at the end of
its three-day congress in Stockholm, Sweden. China has said it acted
to suppress efforts to overthrow its socialist system.
   Belgium banned all official visits to and from China, barred new
Belgian-Chinese projects and suspended a $7.3 million loan because
of China's ``flagrant violation of human rights,'' Foreign Affairs
Minister Mark Eyskens said.
   Eyskens summoned Chinese Ambassador Liu Shan on Thursday and
``vigorously protested the executions and bloody repression that
continue to spread in China,'' a statement from his ministry said.
   Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand said Thursday that his
nation will lodge a formal complaint in Wellington and Beijing to
make clear its ``revulsion'' over the executions. New Zealand
diplomats in Beijing may be recalled for consultations, he said.
   Vatican Radio said, ``The world witnesses with dismay the
chilling chain of executions carried out by Chinese authorities
against the young protagonists of the demonstrations for democracy.
   ``The horror and indignation expressed by so many governments
testifies to the isolation of a line so brutal in the face of the
civilized community of nations.''
   Spain's lower house of Parliament declared that ``death, blood
and violence have never been able to block the path of ideas.''
   A statement read by Felix Pons, president of the 350-seat
chamber, said: ``There is nothing more valuable than human life.''
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno of Japan said that China's
proceeding with the executions ``amid rising international criticism
is extremely regrettable,'' Kyodo News Service reported.
   Uno told reporters Japan was not planning sanctions against China.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino expressed sadness over
executions in China, but ``conceded that the matter is within the
domestic jurisdiction of China's courts,'' a statement in Manila
said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Thursday she would
not consider economic sanctions against China, adding that to do so
might prove dangerous to Britain's subjects in Hong Kong. On
Wednesday she said she was ``utterly appalled'' by the executions.
   Britain has canceled ministerial visits to China and suspended

<HEAD>Crippled Tanker To Be Moved Friday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly three months after it caused the
nation's worst oil spill, the damaged tanker Exxon Valdez will be
towed out of Prince William Sound on Friday for a $25 million repair
job in San Diego, authorities said.
   The Coast Guard said the 987-foot vessel will leave the shelter
of Outside Bay on the southwest side of Naked Island in the heart of
the sound during the morning, weather permitting.
   The Exxon Valdez has been undergoing temporary repairs at Outside
Bay since about two weeks after it ran aground at Bligh Reef on
March 24, ripping its hull and spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil drawn from wells on Alaska's North Slope.
   Eight of the vessel's 13 tanks were penetrated by the reef and
divers reported finding rocks as large as small cars in the cargo
hold. But the tanks have been cleaned to the point that small
schools of herring and salmon have been reported living in them. The
hull also has been steam-cleaned.
   Divers drilled numerous holes along many cracks in the hull and
plated over them to keep the cracks from spreading. One crack was
said to run through the hull until about midship. The cracks had to
be immobilized with plates out of concern that rough seas could
break the vessel in half.
   Several of the vessel's tanks remain unsealed, Exxon spokesman
Joe Tucker said. Coast Guard and salvage officials said air pressure
in the tanks would keep seawater at maneageable levels.
   The tanker will be towed by two tugs, and accompanied by a
salvage vessel and a third tug. But Tucker said the tanker's engines
are in working order and will be be used at the skipper's discretion.
   Since the spill, oil has soiled more than 700 miles of Alaska's
southern coastline. Some of the oil has flushed out of the sound and
traveled with Gulf of Alaska currents some 400 miles to Kodiak
Island and the Alaska Peninsula.
   Workers have recovered more than 26,000 birds killed by the oil,
although biologists say the figure probably represents 10 percent or
less of the overall toll. Other casualties have included more than
50 eagles and nearly 800 sea otters.
   The spill forced closure of numerous herring and salmon fisheries
and severely curtailed others.
   Exxon has more than 9,000 people, backed up by 800 boats and a
small air force, working to clean up the spill. Exxon said this week
it already has spent more than $200 million on the job, and the
state has billed Exxon more than $12 million for oil-spill expenses.
   Under a procedure established two weeks after the spill, the
state sends its bills to Exxon, which pays most of the suppliers and
contractors directly and reimburses the state for out-of-pocket
costs, said Michael Nizich, administrative services director for
Gov. Steve Cowper's office.
   Batches of invoices have been sent almost daily to Exxon. ``Some
of them were pretty hefty in size,'' Nizich said.
   A Coast Guard officer will be on board the Exxon Valdez until it
leaves Prince William Sound, about 60 miles from Naked Island, and
again when the vessel nears San Diego, where the ship was built.
   Tucker said seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts would
be on board throughout the voyage, expected to take about 20 days,
at about 6 mph.
   One worker was killed during the cleanup, and there have numerous
injuries in boat and plane accidents as well as from falls on
oil-slickened beaches.
   The former captain of the Exxon Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, has
been charged with six criminal counts arising from the spill. Among
other things, the state alleges he was drunk at the time.
   Hazelwood has pleaded innocent to all charges. Court officials
say it is unlikely his trial will take place until fall or early
winter.

<HEAD>Committee Urges U.S. Commitment To Magnetically Levitated Trains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States can regain the lead in
developing magnetically levitated trains with a 300 mph potential,
but if it doesn't act soon Japan or West Germany will dominate the
field, according to a report released Thursday.
   ``Mag-lev'' will be an important transportation mode by the year
2000, and decisions made in the next five years will determine which
country gets the patents and leads the industry, said an advisory
committee to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
   ``Because of the overseas competition evolving in this
technology, America's window of opportunity is already beginning to
close,'' the committee wrote.
   Now is the chance for the United States to leapfrog the
competition by creating the second generation of mag-lev trains
using superconducting electromagnets, according to the committee.
   It did not mean the new high-temperature superconductors, but
rather the well-understood, extremely low temperature technology
used over the past 10 years or so for medical imaging devices,
particle accelerators and other devices in high-tech firms around
the world.
   The advisory group prepared the study at the request of New York
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, second-ranking Democrat on the committee
and sponsor of legislation authorizing the Department of
Transportation to develop such trains.
   The report recommends that the U.S. government allocate $750
million over six years to develop, test and demonstrate several
mag-lev prototypes.
   James Powell and Gordon Danby of the Brookhaven National
Laboratory in New York, co-developers of mag-lev trains, outlined
the pluses at a news conference.
   Among them: they are faster than cars or conventional railroads;
they consume less energy than automobiles or airplanes; they pollute
less; they can run in any weather and they experience little wear.
   Mag-lev trains run on a cushion of air above a guideway,
suspended by magnets on the train and in the guideway whose like
poles repel each other. A moving magnetic field in the guideway
attracts a magnet on the train of opposite polarity, pulling the
train at high speed.
   Current magnets hold the train about three-eighths of an inch off
the rails; superconducting models could offer higher stability with
a six-inch elevation.
   The United States pioneered mag-lev transportation in the 1960s
and 1970s, but went only as far as building prototypes and scale
models, said the report. The effort was abandoned in 1975 for lack
of federal funds, ``but was picked up and carried on in a spirit of
raging incrementalism by the Japanese.''
   ``That America walked away from this effort more than a decade
ago is demonstrative of the commercial technology lapses our country
is prone to stumble into, characterized most visibly by the
forfeiting of billion-dollar markets in consumer electronics and
dynamic random access memory semiconductors _ two American
inventions commercially exploited by Japan,'' the report said.
   ``We see many benefits. We don't see any serious drawbacks,''
Powell said.
   At present, the Japanese are testing a full-scale 325 mph
vehicle. West Germany has tested a similar 256 mph system.

<HEAD>Peruvian Novelist Vargas Llosa Drops Bid For Presidency</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrated Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa
for Europe on Thursday after abandoning his bid for the presidency.
   His decision, announced late Wednesday, sent shock waves through
political circles and strengthened the chances of a Communist Party
victory in next year's election.
   Opinion polls showed the famed writer was a solid favorite to
defeat former Lima mayor Alfonso Barrantes, a Marxist, in the
presidential election.
   Vargas Llosa, candidate for a center-right coalition, said in a
letter released to the press that he was stepping out of the race
because of internal disputes within the coalition.
   Vargas Llosa criticized the ``mediocre and petty'' motives of
some within the coalition who raised their own interests above those
of the nation.
   ``The collapse of the Front could open the door of our country to
totalitarian Marxism or a bloody military adventure,'' Vargas Llosa
warned in the letter.
   The letter was directed to former President Fernando Belaunde
Terry, leader of the centrist Popular Action Party, and Luis Bedoya
Reyes, leader of the conservative Popular Christian Party.
   Along with Vargas Llosa's Liberty Movement, the parties are the
most important components of the Democratic Front, which nominated
the 53-year-old writer June 4.
   Belaunde's party has vowed to present its own candidates in
municipal elections in November. Vargas Llosa has argued instead for
single candidates to avoid political warfare among coalition members.
   The presidential election is expected to be held in March, but an
exact date has not been set. The winner will take office on July 28.
   The writer refused to receive any visitors Wednesday night and
left early Thursday for a month-long tour of Europe, an aide said.
   Vargas Llosa, best-known as the author of ``Aunt Julia and the
Scriptwriter'' among other novels, entered the political arena after
organizing a huge demonstration against President Alan Garcia's plan
to nationalize the banks.

<HEAD>Thurmond Urges Fiske to Bow Out of Consideration for Job at Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assocated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond urged Robert B. Fiske Jr.
to withdraw from consideration as deputy attorney general to avoid a
divisive debate in the Senate, the South Carolina Republican's
office said Thursday.
   Thurmond, top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, made
the appeal to Fiske at a meeting with other senators that was
convened by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas on Wednesday.
   ``Senator Thurmond is very concerned that a divisive, protracted
debate about this nomination would not be in anybody's best
interests,'' said Christopher Simpson, the senator's press
secretary. Thurmond told Fiske that conservative opponents of his
nomination might wage a filibuster to block confirmation.
   Thurmond is among 14 GOP senators who signed a letter last week
urging President Bush not to nominate Fiske. They contend that as a
chairman of the American Bar Association's judicial screening panel,
Fiske used ideological criteria to thwart several of President
Reagan's judicial nominees.
   Eighteen moderate or liberal Republicans, meanwhile, sent letters
to Bush this week urging him to nominate Fiske, a prominent Wall
Street lawyer who was once U.S. attorney in New York.
   The GOP surfaced following a report that Bush inadvertently
plugged Fiske for the position during a gathering of U.S. attorneys
at the White House last Friday.
   Noting that a number of former U.S. attorneys held key jobs in
his administration, Bush said: ``We hope to see yet another _ Bob
Fiske of New York _ joining our ranks here soon.''
   The Washington Post, in Thursday's editions, quoted anonymous
White House sources as accusing someone from the Justice Department
of slipping the remark into Bush's speech.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's chief spokesman, disputed the report
saying: ``I just don't think it happened the way it was described.''
   But a White House source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said presidential aides were ``flabbergasted'' when they heard about
Bush's remarks because the issue of whether to nominate Fiske is
still under debate there.
   The source said that the remark about Fiske was not part of the
speech draft after it had been cleared Thursday night.
   Any change in the speech would have had to be cleared by an
elaborate approval process in the White House, the source said.
   The Post reported that the remark was given for insertion to the
``card writer'' who digests speeches onto index cards for delivery
by the president.
   During the meeting with Fiske, Thurmond did not identify the
senators who might mount a filibuster nor did he threaten himself to
wage one, Simpson said.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., another opponent of Fiske who
attended the meeting, said that he had not heard any word of support
for Fiske from the White House.
   ``Based on our concerns, the White House so far has declined to
make such a nomination,'' Humphrey said. ``It is the Justice
Department which is lobbying for this candidate, I haven't heard boo
from the White House.''
   Humphrey said Fiske was accompanied to the meeting by Carol
Crawford, the new assistant attorney general for legislative affairs.
   Crawford told the senators that Fiske would have no role in
selecting nominees for the federal bench, Humphrey said.
   Others attending the meeting included Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., both supporters of Fiske, Humphrey said.
   Runkel said Fiske ``is replying to the senators' concerns. I
still believe that he is going to be nominated and confirmed.''

<HEAD>Members of Congress Denounce Supreme Court Flag Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans rushed to Old Glory's
defense Thursday as the Senate passed a resolution condemning the
Supreme Court decision giving First Amendment protection to those
who desecrate the American flag.
   In addition to the resolution urging the high court to reconsider
Wednesday's decision, a variety of bills aimed at circumventing the
ruling were tossed into legislative hoppers.
   ``Congress has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is
clearly not `speech' as protected by the First Amendment,'' said the
Senate resolution, co-sponsored by Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The resolution, which passed 97-3, voiced alarm that the ruling
may invalidate federal law and statutes in 48 states prohibiting
destruction of the flag.
   Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio, both Democrats, and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, a
Republican, voted against the resolution.
   Kennedy said the Supreme Court ``has the last word on the meaning
of the Constitution'' and that the Senate shouldn't go on record
criticizing the Supreme Court for carrying out its duty.
   Humphrey said that while he didn't like anyone burning or
defacing the flag, he asked, ``What defines desecration?''
   ``This seems to me to be an exercise in silliness and a little
bit of hypocrisy,'' he said. ``It strikes me as intellectually
dishonest.''
   The high court, in a 5-4 vote, threw out the conviction of
Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, who was sentenced to a year in jail and
fined $2,000 for burning the flag in Texas.
   The court said the flag burning at a demonstration in Dallas
during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of
expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
speech.
   The decision was greeted with virtually universal outrage on
Capitol Hill.
   ``Shame on these judges,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. ``Shame
on you, shame on you!.''
   ``We must stand for America. The flag, the flag. America,
America. For us!'' bellowed Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   ``The First Amendment guarantees everyone the freedom to speak,
but it guarantees no one an audience for his words,'' said Mitchell,
a former federal judge. ``I do not believe that Americans have to
see the flag, that symbolizes their freedom to speak, devalued and
cheapened in the cause of preserving that freedom.''
   ``The act of flag burning is not meant to convey any political
idea,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., who was among those
introducing legislation to amend the Constitution to prohibit
flag-desecration. ``It is an act that is solely meant to provoke and
offend.''
   ``With this decision, the court cloaks the most offensive
behavior as political expression,'' said Rep. Owen Pickett, D-Va.,
who introduced a resolution aimed at nullifying the court decision.
   Rep. Doug Applegate, D-Ohio, shouted on the floor of the House:
   ``I'm mad as hell. We've witnessed the greatest travesty in the
annals of jurisprudence, when the Supreme Court allowed the
destruction of the greatest of American symbols. What in God's name
is going on?''
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said he was ``deeply offended'' by the
ruling.
   ``The Reagan court has given us ... constitutional protection for
the burning of Old Glory,'' he said. ``This liberal Democrat says,
`For shame!'''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he was disappointed with the ruling.
   ``In my view, the American flag represents the pre-eminent symbol
of our republic and all for which it stands,'' he said.

<HEAD>Chemical Industry Now Supports Toxics Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's chemical manufacturers said
Thursday they have abandoned their previous opposition, and now
support new legislation to control airborne toxic chemicals.
   ``We intend to be a constructive player in the legislative
process,'' Robert C. Forney, a Du Pont Co. executive, told the House
Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee on behalf of the
Chemical Manufacturers Association.
   Forney said the chemical industry's trade group previously
believed new legislation was unnecessary, but has now concluded the
Environmental Protection Agency ``cannot adequately regulate air
emissions under the existing law.''
   But Forney and other industry witnesses clashed with Rep. Henry
A. Waxman, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, over the need for
provisions designed to prevent accidental chemical releases.
   Forney said ``a great deal has been done by industry'' to prevent
accidents, and ``we don't believe additional legislation is
required.''
   ``I find it difficult to understand that position,'' Waxman said,
citing Environmental Protection Agency figures showing there were
more than 4,700 accidential releases between 1980 and 1987. The 120
most serious releases killed 145 people, injured more than 5,000,
and caused nearly 250,000 to evacuate their homes, Waxman said.
   Gerald V. Poje of the National Wildlife Federation said it is
essential that any legislation include provisions to deal with
chemical accidents such as the disaster in Bhopal, India in 1984. In
that case, more than 3,000 people died when the rupture of a storage
tank unleased deadly methyl isocyanate.
   Industrial facilities and communities ``are unprepared to
understand and respond to the consequences of chemical accidents,''
he said, testifying for the National Clean Air Coalition,
representing environmental groups.
   One House bill, supported by Waxman and environmental groups,
would require EPA to develop a list of substances most likely to
endanger the public through accidental releases to the air and issue
regulations to prevent such releases.
   The EPA has recently disclosed that some 2.7 billion pounds of
toxic substances go into the air each year, but the agency only
regulates only seven of more than 200 chemicals that are released.
   According to the agency, some 360 million pounds involve
suspected carcinogens, contributing to between 1,500 and 3,000 fatal
cancers each year. Chemical emissions also are factors in
respiratory disease and birth defects.
   A number of legislative proposals, including a clean air package
unveiled this month by President Bush, would force industry to use
the best available technology to reduce emissions. The proposals
would regulate either the chemicals themselves or set limits for
industrial categories such as steel mills or pulp and paper.
   Industry witnesses told the subcommittee, however, many of the
solutions proposed so far would be too harsh and should be changed.
   ``Improvement can be made by adopting provisions ... for
reasonable technology'' instead of the best available, said Terry F.
Yosie, vice president for health and environment of the American
Petroleum Institute, the trade group for the oil industry.
   The controls, he said should be placed only on ``those sources
found to be significant emitters of toxic air pollutants.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Disagree on Permanent Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several witnesses who object to smoking urged
Congress on Thursday to extend and expand a no-smoking policy on
short airline flights, but the tobacco industry insisted that health
research doesn't justify a ban.
   More than two dozen witnesses submitted testimony at a House
Public Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee hearing on
several bills that would either make the temporary ban permanent or
expand it to cover all flights. Smoking is outlawed on domestic
flights of less than two hours, but the rule is to lapse in April
1990 unless Congress acts.
   Witnesses ranged from a flight attendant who said her health was
ruined serving smoking passengers, to an indoor air expert who said
there are worse health hazards _ including infectious disease _ in
an airliner cabin than smoke.
   Opponents, including tobacco interests and some lawmakers, urged
that Congress await the results of a Transportation Department study
of the air aboard airliners before enacting any new law. The study
is expected to be completed before the ban is lifted.
   ``Only a total ban on airline smoking will adequately protect the
health and safety of airline passengers and flight crews,'' said
Rep. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., who is sponsoring legislation that
would give Congress a choice of making the ban permanent or
expanding it to cover all commercial flights.
   ``It is our job to esnure that those especially sensitive to
cigarette smoke are free of having it foisted upon them in the
confines of an airplane cabin,'' said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli,
D-N.J.
   Reps. Lindsay Thomas, R-Ga., and Tom DeLay, R-Texas, however,
echoed the Tobacco industry's stand that no legislation should be
passed before the airliner air quality study is completed.
   ``I hope we will find a solution to this problem which will
protect the rights of both those who choose to smoke and those who
have decided not to do so,'' said Thomas.
   Representatives of several anti-smoking groups, the American
Medical Association, the American Association for Respiratory Care
and, the Association of Flight Attendants called for a permanent ban
of smoking on all flights, saying smoking poses a proven health
hazard to nonsmoking passengers and crew as well as to smokers.
   Flight attendant Cathy Gilbert-Silva said working on flights
where smoking was allowed severely affected her health. She
complained of worsening sinus infections, bronchial problems,
laryngitis, scratchy throat and blocked ears.
   ``A total ban will not cure me but I know I will not get worse
and I can continue in the job I have grown to love without fear for
my health,'' she said.
   Charles O. Whitley of the Tobacco Institute said a permanent ban
would unjustly abandon any effort to accommodate smokers.
   He said studies show that a nonsmoking passenger would have to
make eight continuous New York-to-Tokyo roundtrip flights before
being exposed to the nicotine equivalent of a single cigarette.
   Gray Robinson, president of a company that specializes in
fighting indoor air pollution, ACVA Atlantic Inc., said an airline
passenger is more likely to get sick from bacteria, fungi and
viruses floating in the poorly ventilated air tan from cigarette
smoke.
   He said there is no scientific data to justify a smoking ban but
took no position on the legislation.
   ``Ironically, there has been no evidence of excessive levels of
carbon monoxide, airborne particulates or nicotine, all of which
have been linked to tobacco smoke as a source,'' Robinson said.
   For 60 cents per passenger, ventilation can be increased to
healthy levels on a Boeing 747, Robinson said.
   He recommended that the committee pass legislation requiring
improved ventilation and filtration of air on planes with regular
inspections and monitoring of air quality levels.

   Two Texas women arrested in a Washington motel
room where police found a cache of high-powered weapons pleaded
guilty Thursday to misdemeanor gun possession charges.
   Margaret Arredondo, 29, of Dallas, pleaded guilty to possession
of a machine gun and possession of a silencer, while Diana Joy
McEwen, 28, of Rowlett, Texas, pleaded guilty to two counts of
possession of a machine gun and one count of possession of a
silencer.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Mildred Edwards
sentenced Ms. Arredondo to concurrent 180-day sentences for the two
misdemeanor counts, but ordered the sentences be suspended and that
she serve one year's unsupervised probation.
   Ms. McEwen was sentenced to 90-day concurrent sentences for each
count, to be suspended, and will serve one year's probation, to be
transferred to Texas.
   The two women were among six Texans arrested on 41 misdemeandor
weapons charges stemming from an April raid on the EconoLodge Motel,
where police said they found arms including an M-16 grenade
launcher, machine and handguns, and silencers.
   Ms. Arredondo's attorney, Duff Lewis, said she became involved
with the group when she drove up to Washington from Texas to bring
her brother, Ruben Anzaldua, who is one of the defendants in the
case, his children.
   Lewis said Ms. Arredondo was not allowed to leave once she caught
up with the group, and that the alleged leaders of the group,
Richard McEwen and his wife, Billie Joy McEwen of Rowlett, the
adopted parents of Diana Joy McEwen, would not let her leave.
   Diana McEwen's attorney told the court that her client ``had been
the victim of Mr. McEwen's fetishes, sexual and otherwise.''

<HEAD>Panel Adds Funds To Save V-22 Osprey</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved an amendment in
closed session Thursday seeking to save the V-22 Osprey aircraft by
pumping $351 million of research and development funds into the
program, House members said.
   The amendment was approved 11-7 by the Armed Services research
and development subcommittee, according to Reps. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,
and Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa.
   Sponsored by Weldon and Foglietta, the amendment was backed
despite opposition by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., and by Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., the panel's ranking
Republican, according to Weldon press aide Doug Ritter.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in overseeing cuts in the fiscal
1990 budget promised by President Bush, announced in April that he
was scuttling the V-22 program as too expensive.
   The V-22, described by the Marine Corps as its most important
weapons program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to take off
like a helicopter and fly like a plane.
   Weldon said the amendment would pull $351 million from research
and development money initially earmarked for the B-2 bomber. He
said he would soon introduce an amendment in the full committee to
``switch accounts,'' replenishing the B-2 research funds by taking
the money from B-2 procurement.
   On Tuesday, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, urged Cheney to suspend
production of the B-2 because the aircraft has yet to undergo flight
testing. The radar-evading aircraft is the most expensive plane in
history.
   Weldon made no predictions on whether his amendment would survive
in the full committee.
   ``This is one battle in a continuing series of what is going to
be a prolonged effort. It's the first recorded effort to oppose the
secretary on the V-22,'' Weldon said.
   The two contracting partners developing the V-22 are the Boeing
Helicopter Co. in Pennsylvania and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. in
Texas.

   An assailant in a pickup truck
shot an elderly U.S. nun in the head while she rode in another truck
with two other nuns, a witness and authorities said Thursday.
   Sister Mary MacKey, 73, was in serious condition with a bullet
wound behind the left eye. U.S. Ambassador William Walker said she
was conscious when he visited her at Policlinica Hospital at midday
Thursday.
   The attack brought to mind one of the civil war's most well known
cases of human rights abuses. The 1980 murders of four U.S.
churchwomen by National Guard troops provoked a temporary suspension
of U.S. aid to the Central American nation.
   But the motive in Wednesday evening's attack was not immediately
known, and a robbery attempt was cited as one possibility.
   The shooting occurred 10 miles south of the capital outside
Zaragoza, where Sister MacKey, a registered nurse, worked at a home
for orphans of the 9-year-old war between the government and leftist
guerrillas.
   Extreme rightists and some armed forces officers consider nuns,
priests and other churchpeople who work in poor communities
sympathizers of the guerrillas.
   Walker promised that the embassy will impress upon the Salvadoran
government the need to find those responsible for the attack,
embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said.
   Jacobs said the embassy will provide any assistance requested,
including medical evacuation. He said Sister MacKey probably will be
flown in coming days to Houston, headquarters of her order, the
Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word.
   Corporal Asencio Mejia of the Zaragoza Civil Defense, which is in
charge of the preliminary investigation, said the assailants and
their vehicle had not been found.
   Sister Ana Maria Brangan, who was driving the pickup carrying
Sister MacKey and another nun, said she and her companions were
approaching Zaragoza from the capital when a yellow pickup carrying
at least six men _ four of them in the bed _ pulled alongside.
   ``They stayed alongside and pulled closer, and I didn't
understand what was going on. Then I heard a noise and thought they
had bumped us. I didn't realize it was a bullet,'' she told
reporters at the hospital.
   The single shot broke the Mazda's passenger side window and
entered Sister MacKey's skull.
   The Rev. Ken Myers, founder of the orphanage, said doctors told
him she probably will lose her left eye.
   Myers said the attack probably was not political and could have
been part of a robbery attempt. He said the attackers apparently
were not members of the armed forces.
   ``There were at least six men in the truck and only one weapon,''
he said. ``They may have been thieves. Maybe they were drunk.''
   Sister Brangan said she and her two companions had stopped at the
bank before heading for Zaragoza but did not make a withdrawal. She
said the other nun in the Mazda, Sister Juana Flores, saw a man
standing in the back of the yellow pickup fire the single pistol
shot.
   Sister Brangan said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped, and
the yellow pickup stopped ahead of her vehicle. When she started
again, the attackers took off.
   Myers, 48, said neither he nor the sisters have been directly
threatened but there are frequent insinuations they are leftist
sympathizers.
   ``That kind of thing happens all the time because of the kind of
work we do: the orphanage, bringing in medicine, a clinic for poor
people,'' he said.
   Sister MacKey is a native of County Clare, Ireland, and a
naturalized U.S. citizen who has worked in Central America since
1963 and in El Salvador since 1983, according to Myers.
   Myers founded the orphanage where Sister Mackey works, the Oscar
Arnulfo Romero Community, the same year the four churchwomen were
killed. It is named after the Salvadoran archbishop murdered by an
extreme rightist gunman while saying Mass in March 1980.
   The orphanage is home to about 200 children left without family
by the civil war.
   In the 1980 case, five National Guardsmen were convicted of
murder and sentenced in 1984 to 30 years in prison.
   They had intercepted the vehicle carrying the three nuns and a
lay worker who worked with refugees, taken them to a secluded spot
and killed them with bullets fired into the head. Two of the four
women were raped.

<HEAD>Democrats Urge Phased Troop Withdrawal from South Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic lawmakers Thursday urged Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to reject any agreement with South Korea that
would require the United States to maintain troops in that nation at
current levels.
   ``Some of us on the committee think that no such assurance should
be given,'' Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., told Cheney, who testified
before the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   ``On the contrary, negotiations ought to begin for a phased
withdrawal from South Korea,'' Johnston said.
   Members of the panel cited a recent letter that South Korean
Defense Minister Lee Sang-Hoon sent to Cheney asking the United
States to promise not to withdraw the more than 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed there.
   The minister told South Korea's national assembly defense
committee that he would ask the United States to sign a joint
communique with that commitment when he travels here next month.
   Johnston and three other Democrats _ Dale Bumpers of Arkansas,
Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Patrick Leahy of Vermont _ wrote to
Cheney urging him to reject any preconditions for a U.S. troop
withdrawal.
   The senators said Cheney's meeting next month with the Korean
official would be an ideal opportunity to ``begin discussions on
reducing our military presence in Korea.''
   The United States spends $2.6 billion a year to maintain its
troops in South Korea.
   Bumpers said at the hearing that South Korea's gross national
product is seven times that of North Korea, its population is twice
that of North Korea and it only spends 5 percent of its GNP on
defense.
   ``I have become increasingly convinced that debate ought to begin
about our presence in Korea,'' he said.
   Cheney said the United States has no plans to reduce the U.S.
commitment to Korea, but that cuts in troop levels are possible,
``just as there is a proposal to reduce our troop level in Europe.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee called last month for a reduction of the South Korea-based
forces to 10,000.

<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos stole gold, U.S. aid and
Japanese war reparations, took kickbacks and used an international
network of cronies and banks in looting the Philippines of $5
billion, newly filed documents allege.
   The documents filed in U.S. District Court here contain the most
detailed charges yet against the deposed Philippine leader and his
wife, Imelda, said plaintiff's attorney Ronald L. Olsen.
   But Marcos attorney John Bartko said Thursday the filing, which
amended a 3-year-old lawsuit by the Philippine government seeking
$50 billion in damages from the Marcoses, was just a rehash of old
allegations.
   He characterized Wednesday's action as a publicity stunt at a
time when Marcos is near death. Marcos was in very critical and
unstable condition Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center in
Honolulu.
   ``It doesn't make any sense to include old material at a time
like this,'' Bartko said. ``Everybody knows Marcos is likely to die
in the near future.''
   Marcos, president of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, and his
wife plundered property and money by ``diverting foreign economic
assistance to which the Philippine government was entitled, and
extorting, soliciting and accepting bribes, kickbacks, illicit
gratuities and commissions'' in exchange for favors, the amended
lawsuit said.
   During that time, Marcos claimed average after-tax earnings of
about $50,000 a year.
   Programs tapped by the Marcoses included the U.S. Economic
Support Fund, Japanese war reparations and Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund, the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit also claims the Marcoses:
   _ Received more than $53 million in kickbacks on contracts with
at least seven Japanese companies.
   _ In 1973 diverted to their personal use 800,000 troy ounces of
gold from Philippine Central Bank reserves.
   _ Converted to their personal use more than $27 million from the
Philippine National Bank and bought more than 52 million pesos worth
of items at Philippine duty-free shops, thus avoiding substantial
taxes.
   The lawsuit said that the couple, either by themselves or through
others' help, maintained 58 bank accounts in Los Angeles, Beverly
Hills, Calif.; San Francisco and New York to shelter their gains.
   According to the lawsuit, the accounts were rarely in the name of
the Marcoses, who operated behind ``nominees and surrogates or
through multiple layers of offshore and onshore entities organized
principally in the Netherlands Antilles, Panama, the Cayman Islands,
Hong Kong and the United States.''
   The Marcoses have been hit with more than 40 lawsuits, including
a criminal lawsuit filed by the U.S. government in New York and
several cases in the Philippines.
   Bartko contends there is only one significant lawsuit: the one in
New York. ``And, hopefully, it will be decided on the evidence,'' he
said.
   The nine defendants in the Los Angeles case include the Marcoses,
Saudi Arabian millionaire Adnan Khashoggi, now living in
Switzerland, and Roberto D. Benedicto, a Marcos associate who is a
fugitive from federal charges in New York stemming from many of the
same allegations outlined in this lawsuit.
   Other defendants are the California Overseas Bank in Los Angeles
and the Redwood Bank in San Francisco, which were allegedly
controlled by Marcos and his associates; and three offshore
companies, Krodos Properties, N.V., of the Netherlands Antilles, Al
Djebel Corp. of the Cayman Islands and Lei Investments Ltd. of the
Channel Islands.

<HEAD>Prosecution Reconstructs U.S. Soldier's Activities in East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FULDA, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution said Thursday that a
U.S. soldier who admits giving military secrets to East Germany
handed communist officials information on how the Army would respond
to an attack.
   A court martial is hearing the case of Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri,
22, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., who changed his plea from not guilty
to guilty of espionage in a surprise move at Wednesday's opening
session.
   Peri left the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda late on Feb.
20, taking with him two computer discs containing classified
information and a lap-top computer. He was found to be missing the
next day. He returned voluntarily to his unit on March 4.
   Peri told the court on Wednesday he went to East Germany because
he had problems at work and was frustrated with his job.
   ``I was never really sure what I was going to do at all,'' he was
quoted as saying by the military's unofficial Stars and Stripes
newspaper. ``I really didn't have a plan. ... Everything had been
wrong. I wasn't enjoying myself. I wanted to start over somewhere
else.''
   Peri could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison on the
expionage charge. He faces lesser charges of absent without leave
and wrongfully appropriating government property.
   Chief Prosecutor Maj. Michael Graham on Thursday sketched this
sequence of events in connection with Peri's absence:
   Late on Feb. 20, Peri went to the regiment's intelligence office
where he worked and removed a lap-top computer and two floppy discs
containing classified information on the unit's general defense
plans.
   The plans dealt with how the 11th Armored Cavalry, a front-line
defense unit, would react in case of an attack from the Soviet bloc.
   The same day, Peri drove a military vehicle about 60 miles to a
spot near the East German border. He abandoned the vehicle when it
got stuck in a wooded area, walked to a border fence and climbed
over it, carrying computer and discs.
   Graham said Peri ``wandered around in East Germany for about two
hours,'' then went to a communist border guard tower and turned
himself over to the East Germans, later handing over computer and
discs to unidentified East German officials in East Berlin.
   The prosecutor said analysis later showed the computer ``had been
accessed and set up to print out material'' _ meaning the East
Germans had copied the information.
   Graham then went into detail on exchanges between U.S. and East
German officials after Peri's abandoned vehicle was found on Feb. 24.
   He said the East Germans informed the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin
on March 3 ``that they had released Peri to travel to a country of
his choice,'' and that on the same day, the East Germans returned
the computer and discs to Peri, who traveled by train to Salzburg,
Austria.
   ``He stayed in one of the most expensive hotels in Salzburg,'' on
the night of March 3, and the next day began traveling by train for
his home unit in Fulda, where he was later arrested, the prosecutor
said.
   Peri sat quietly during the session, occasionally whispering to
his chief defense counsel, Maj. William D. Stokes.
   His parents, Fred and Winnie Peri, and sister Desiree, from
Orange County, Calif., were also present and sat listening quietly.
   The court martial proceedings are slated to continue Friday with
testimony from Peri's military associates and medical experts who
have examined him.

<HEAD>Showers And Thunderstorms Scattered Across The East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More rain fell across the already-soaked eastern third of the
nation Thursday as residents coped with flooding from Pennsylvania
to Alabama.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell mainly from the Gulf
Coast to the middle Atlantic Coast and southern sections of the
Great Lakes region.
   Flood or flash flood watches remained in effect for sections of
Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, West
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York state.
   In Tennessee, Gov. Ned McWherter requested federal disaster aid
for Rhea County, where $400,000 in damage to flooded homes and
businesses was reported. Numerous recreation areas in the state were
under water.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority was hindered during the rain
because it did not have its vast reservoir system drawn down, not
surprising since this is the wettest June since TVA was created 56
years ago.
   Average June rainfall across the river valley has been 7.55
inches through Thursday morning, compared to a normal average of
just under 3 inches for the entire month, TVA said. So far this year
the valley has gotten 34.29 inches of rain, about 3 inches below
rainfall for all of 1988 _ compared with an average of 26.58 through
the end of the month in a normal year.
   In Alabama, floods have caused at least $2 million in damage to
crops and homes, officials said Thursday.
   However, the rain has helped replenish Alabama's groundwater
supplies, depleted by two straight years of drought.
   ``Over most of the state, the water levels have completely
recovered from the drought we had last summer,'' said James D.
Moore, director of the water division of the Geological Survey of
Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
   Unofficial reports indicated 6 to nearly 7 inches of rain fell
Thursday morning on eastern Montgomery County in parched
southwestern Iowa.
   ``The old ground sucked that up like you wouldn't believe. It
hadn't seen it in a while, and it took advantage of it,'' said
Montgomery County Sheriff Marvin Meggison.
   Reports of a dousing in western Iowa apparently convinced
commodity traders that severely dry conditions there were easing,
and corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Along the Licking River in central Ohio, two families were
evacuated at Newark when the water reached its 17-foot flood stage.
At Utica, about 10 miles north of Newark, firefighters and
volunteers piled up sandbags on the south side of the city in an
attempt to hold back the river, authorities said.
   Storms also raised several rivers in southeastern Michigan above
flood stage Thursday, authorities said.
   In addition, a number of arriving and departing morning flights
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport were delayed by dense fog, air
traffic manager Jerry Linton said.
   Elsewhere, there were showers over eastern Colorado, the Texas
Panhandle western Oklahoma, and western and central Kansas.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set in Casper, Wyo.,
where it was 34 degrees; Cheyenne, Wyo., 35; Rapid City, S.D., 39;
Scottsbluff, Neb., 38; and Winslow, Ariz., 45.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 105 at Palm Springs,
Calif. Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 27 degrees at
Craig, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
across much of the nation east of the Rockies, with thunderstorms
especially from southern Louisiana to Alabama, over North Carolina,
and in the upper Ohio Valley, and showers most numerous from
northeastern Minnesota to upper Michigan and northern lower
Michigan. Showers also were forecast over the northern Rockies, with
showers most numerous in western Montana.
   Highs only in the 60s were predicted in the northern Rockies; in
the 60s and 70s in southern New England, along much of the Pacific
Coast, and across the northern and central high Plains to upper
Michigan; above 90 across Florida and southern Georgia, and from the
lower Mississippi Valley to southern New Mexico and the valleys and
deserts of California; and above 100 in the desert Southwest.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is continuing to seek
increased aid to non-communist rebels in Cambodia, Vice President
Dan Quayle said Thursday, asking congressional critics not to be
``paralyzed by a memory'' of Vietnam.
   The United States wants a transitional government in Cambodia
with ``a key role'' by opposition leaders Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
the former ruler of the country, and Son Sann, Quayle said in
remarks to the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   State Department officials have acknowledged slim chances of
getting new aid through Congress where some members are concerned
that the aid could fall into the hands of the communist Khmer Rouge.
   But the vice president said that beefing up aid to the
non-communist forces to try to influence what will happen after the
impending departure of the occupying Vietnamese would reduce the
chances of the Khmer Rouge returning top power.
   ``By doing nothing, we would increase the likelihood of continued
civil war and the potential for a return to power by the murderous
Khmer Rouge,'' Quayle said.
   ``The unacknowledged but all-too-tangible presence in the debate
over Cambodia is the ghost of Vietnam. But, my friends, it is now
time to lay this ghost to rest,'' he said.
   ``No great nation can long afford to be paralyzed by a memory. We
must not permit the non-communist resistance in Cambodia to
becoemthe last casualty of the Vietnam war.''
   On the other hand, the vice president said, ``We have learned
that America cannot fight others' battles for them.''
   The Khmer Rouge gained notoriety for the brutality of their
regime from 1973 to 1978 when more than 1 million people died under
leader Pol Pot.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said that it would be a
fact of life that the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the current
insurgent groups, would have a role in a future Cambodian government.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., is pushing an effort in Congress to
boost military aid for the non-communists from the current $7
million a year to as much as $30 million.

   A man who taped his brother's arrest won a
recommendation for disciplinary action against one of the policemen
involved, but faces felony charges of illegally recording the
incident.
   The charges stem from the March 15 arrest of Renee Myles on a
federal drug charge in West Tampa, according to a June 14 report to
Police Chief Austin C. McLane by the police department's internal
affairs division.
   Two of the suspect's brothers began arguing with a policeman.
One, Frank Myles, feared violence and switched on a tape recorder
apparently concealed in a bag he was carrying, the report said.
   After Officer John M. Yaratch asked Renee Myles for
identification, he argued with the other brother, David Myles.
Yaratch then forced Renee Myles down on a car and handcuffed David
Myles.
   Yaratch yelled expletives at the man, then requested
identification from Frank Myles, the report said.
   Frank Myles ``made an aggressive move'' toward the officer, who
grabbed the man's arm and forced him against a car, the report said.
   Frank Myles later played the tape for the officer's superiors.
   The report recommended disciplinary action against Yaratch.
   Frank Myles was arrested March 25 on two felony counts of
illegally recording a conversation, and released from the
Hillsborough County Jail.
   Except in criminal investigations, it generally is illegal in
Florida to tape-record conversations between two people without both
parties' consent. If convicted on both counts, Myles faces up to 10
years in prison and $10,000 in fines.
   The state attorney's office said the matter is still under
investigation. The internal investigation of Yaratch is completed,
but a decision on possible disciplinary action against him is
pending, officials said.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Greece's conservative party
demanded Thursday that Andreas Papandreou resign as the interim
premier because of a new banking scandal, the latest to occur under
Papandreou's socialist government.
   Papandeou later was admitted to a hospital, and doctors said he
had an infection of the respiratory system. Papandreou, 70, who
underwent triple bypass heart surgery in September, was reported in
excellent condition after he entered the General State hospital.
   Doctors said the prime minister would spend the night at the
hospital, but that his illness ``does not prevent execution of his
duties.''
   Constantine Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party has until
Friday to form a coalition, said Papandreou was ``responsible and
guilty'' in the scandal involving the state-owned Greek Mortgage
Bank and the Atlantic Bank of New York, a subsidiary of the
state-controlled National Bank of Greece.
   U.S. officials allege the Mortgage Bank operated illegally in the
United States and helped people avoid taxes and get around bank
reporting laws. It is accused of laundering at least $700 million.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney announced in New York on Wednesday
that 13 employees and executives of the Mortgage Bank had been
arrested. There were no allegations of wrongdoing against U.S. banks.
   ``These usurpers of power who shame Greece and rob the Greek
people must leave immediately ... it's vital that a new government
is formed now,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.
   New Democracy emerged the winner of Sunday's general elections
with 145 seats in the 300-seat unicameral Parliament but fell short
of an absolute majority necessary to form a government.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, won 125
seats, failing to win a third consecutive four-year term.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of the Greek
Communist Party and the small Eurocommunist Left, won 28 seats.
   On Tuesday, President Christos Sartzetakis gave Mitsotakis three
days to form a government. If he fails, the other two major parties
will have a chance to form a coalition.
   If there is no government by July 3, Parliament will be dissolved
and a caretaker government will be formed by the president to
prepare for new elections.
   Mitsotakis said a caretaker government should be formed
immediately and that elections should be held no later than
September, because Papandreou ``will do his utmost to cover up ''
the Mortgage Bank scandal.
   The scandal gave Papandeou's political opponents new ammunition
since it took place during his socialist administration's tenure in
office. Ranking executives in state-controlled institutions are
traditionally appointed by the government in power at the time.
   The new scandal surfaced one day after Parliament was asked to
lift the immunity of two former PASOK ministers accused of
involvement in a scandal involving the Bank of Crete.
   Former Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas allegedly
received $2 million from fugitive banker George Koskotas for passing
a law that blocked an investigation at his troubled bank.
   Former Public Order Minister George Petsos is charged with
receiving gifts and money from the banker.
   Koutsogiorgas' wife, Aliki, was allegedly involved in the payoff
by depositing the $2 million in a joint account with her husband at
a Swiss bank.
   Koskotas, who is held in the United States pending a hearing on
an extradition request, was charged with offering the bribe. His
lawyer, Yannis Mantzouranis, a former secretary to Papandreou's
Cabinet, was charged with complicity for arranging the payoff.

   New regulations to protect the public from
contaminated drinking water may prevent 90,000 cases of water-borne
diseases every year but will mean higher water bills for millions of
Americans, the Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.
   The agency announced final regulations that will require nearly
10,000 providers of drinking water, serving an estimated 150 million
people, to comply with strict filtration requirements to rid the
water of disease-causing germs.
   The regulations, which apply to communities where drinking water
comes from surface sources such as rivers and streams, are aimed at
reducing the risk of illness from a variety of microscopic organisms
such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa.
   The new regulations require that these public water systems use
disinfectants of prescribed performance, and those not meeting
certain strict purity standards must be treated by filtration. If
not, states must devise another way to eliminate the germs, such as
additional chemicals.
   Maximum concentrations are established for some microorganisms
and treatment techniques are required for others.
   The rules also specify that treatment plant operators meet state
qualifications and they set up new monitoring and reporting
requirements.
   The agency has estimated that tens of thousands of people become
ill yearly from such contamination. EPA estimated the more stringent
water purification procedures are likely to prevent annually about
90,000 illnesses, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach
upsets.
   ``These rules are a major step forward in providing maximum
protection for our nation's drinking-water supplies,'' said EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly.
   But EPA said the new requirements also will be expensive with
expected initial capital costs at about $3 billion and operational
costs of about $500 million a year.
   The agency said the additional costs are expected to be passed
onto customers, but the increase in household water bills is likely
to vary widely depending on the size of the public water system and
whether the system already has some filtration equipment.
   According to EPA estimates, in rural areas where water systems
serve fewer than 500 customers and where no filtration is now used,
household water bills could increase from $30 to $50 a month. In
urban areas with more customers to bear the cost, the increase is
likely to be about $6 a month, perhaps much less if some filtration
equipment already is being used.
   About one-third of the nearly 10,000 water systems subject to the
tighter requirements currently have no filtration system, the agency
said.
   Those systems serve more than 21 million people, including
residents of major cities such as Boston, New York City, Newark,
N.J., San Francisco and Seattle.
   Some other cities not filtering their drinking water are
Portland, Maine; Syracuse and Utica, N.Y.; Scranton, Bethlehem, and
Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; Greenville, S.C., Reno and Sparks, Nev.; Tacoma,
Wash., and Portland, Ore.
   Local authorities have four years in which to install new
equipment, said EPA spokesman David Ryan.

<HEAD>Jury Selected For Trial Of Former PTL Aides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury was selected Thursday in the trial
of two former aides to PTL founder Jim Bakker after a day that
included such questions as whether they recognized Jaguar, Cartier
and other luxury brand names.
   David Taggart, 32, and his older brother and housemate, James,
35, are accused of not paying $494,000 in income taxes from 1983 to
1987. They also are charged with using more than $1.1 million of PTL
money to pay personal bills, including $55,000 in purchases from the
Cartier jewelry store in New York.
   A jury of eight women and four men was selected to hear the
Taggarts' trial, which is scheduled to begin July 5 and is expected
to take about a month. Four alternate jurors also were picked.
   The Taggarts' trial will be a prelude to the August trial of
Bakker and Richard Dortch. The two former PTL leaders are accused of
diverting more than $4 million in PTL money for their own benefit.
   David Taggart went to work at PTL in 1978 when he was 21 as an
administrative assistant to the television ministry's music
director. The young piano player soon became Bakker's most trusted
aide, and perhaps PTL's second most powerful executive.
   David Taggart, according to PTL records, drew more than $620,000
in pay in the 15 months ending March 1987 _ the same month Bakker
resigned in a sex and money scandal. James Taggart _ then PTL's
interior decorator _ received nearly $300,000 during that period.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter asked some potential jurors if
they regularly contributed to a church or a religious organization.
He also asked if they were familiar with certain brand names such as
Gucci, Jaguar, Cartier and Mercedes Benz. He then asked if they buy
most of their clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensive
shops and if they normally pay with cash, credit cards or checks.
   It was not known whether any prospective jurors were excluded on
the basis of their answers to the questions.
   The Taggarts' wardrobes included mink coats, designer clothes and
expensive jewelry. They bought a $660,000 condominium on New York's
Fifth Avenue and a $317,000 two-story stucco house in southeast
Charlotte.
   For Christmas in 1986, they gave each other black Jaguar cars
worth $87,765.
   Federal prosecutors are trying to prove the Taggarts conspired to
defraud the IRS by using PTL credit cards to get cash advances,
ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, and then using the money to pay
personal bills.
   The Taggarts also are accused of using blank PTL checks to pay
off their American Express bills. One check was for $50,000, another
for $45,000, the indictment said.

   President Bush told a Republican fund-raiser
Thursday night that his party had a good chance of winning the
city's mayoral election, and then mangled the name of the GOP
frontrunner.
   He intended to praise Rudolph Giuliani, the former top federal
prosecutor in New York whom polls show is leading a field of three
GOP candidates seeking to wrest the seat from Democrats.
   First, Bush told Republicans this year offered a ``great
opportunity'' to win ``the most powerful local office in America.''
   ``And accordingly, I would like to commend our three mayoral
candidates, Rudolph Gi-a _ Gi-a _ ,'' he said.
   Then he continued: ``Gi-o-hani-uh.'' He paused, and exclaimed:
``Rudy.''
   ``Sorry about that,'' he apologized.
   He then went on to praise the other two GOP candidates who will
compete in September's primary: businessman Ron Lauder and educator
Herbert London.
   Giuliani seemed unconcerned.
   ``Well, we're happy. I appreciated the Rudy part,'' he told
reporters. ``Our posters all say Rudy.''
   ``I think we're making progress, when people come up to me on the
street and say: `Hello, Rudy, how are you doing?'
   ``If you haven't taken Latin, sometimes the name Giuliani can be
a little difficult,'' he added.
   It wasn't the only difficulty of the evening.
   The White House put out an official transcript of the president's
remarks, which sanitized his performance through getting the
Giuliani's last name right _ and then the transcript misspelled the
candidate's first name as ``Rudolf.''

   A man whose 10-year-old daughter accused him of
sexually abusing her and whose ex-wife went to prison to keep her
hidden was awarded legal custody of the child, touching off a
protest by angry women Thursday.
   The ruling by a probate judge granted joint physical custody of
Nicole LaLonde to Stephen and Virginia LaLonde, effective July 9.
The girl will be with her father four days a week and with her
mother the rest of the time.
   But Stephen LaLonde won sole legal custody, giving him the power
to determine such matters as where Nicole attends school and her
day-to-day care.
   About 50 women gathered outside the Statehouse on Thursday
afternoon to protest Wednesday's decision. Many work at rape crisis
centers, while others were victims of rape or incest, said Dede
Ketover, a rally organizer.
   ``I'm here because the judge put out a very clear message that
tells kids, `If you've been molested, don't talk about it because no
one's going to believe you,' and that tells mothers that if you're
going to fight for your kids you're going to lose,'' Ketover said.
``The courts can't protect these kids.''
   ``The system has failed Nicole,'' Kim Morrison, a counselor at
the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center said earlier. ``They have left
open the possibility of sexual abuse after all this trauma. Nicole
has gotten nowhere.''
   But Suffolk County Probate Judge Mary Fitzpatrick ruled the
evidence did not prove that LaLonde sexually abused and threatened
Nicole.
   The judge, describing Nicole as intelligent and eager to please
her parents, noted that the child vacillated in her story and
recanted more than once.
   ``Under these circumstances, the court cannot simply take the
child's word as the truth since the court would be in the untenable
position of having to arbitrarily select one of the child's versions
over another,'' Ms. Fitzpatrick said.
   ``At the same time, the fact tha Nicole has wavered in her
allegations does not automatically preclude the veracity of those
allegations,'' she said.
   The judge also ordered that Nicole continue receiving
psychotherapy.
   Ms. LaLonde's attorney, Beth Herr, said the decision would be
appealed. She said her client was ``very concerned about her
daughter's welfare and safety.''
   LaLonde was elated by the ruling, said his attorney, Peter
DiGangi.
   The LaLondes began fighting over their daughter's custody in a
closed trial that began May 1988 in Boston before Fitzpatrick.
   Ms. LaLonde and her daughter claimed the child had been abused by
LaLonde, who denied the accusation.
   The LaLondes divorced in 1983. Three years later, Ms. LaLonde
accused her ex-husband of abusing their child during visits. Another
probate judge ruled the charges were unfounded.
   Rather than see Stephen LaLonde gain custody, mother and child
fled the state in June 1986 and settled in Florida. In March 1987,
Ms. LaLonde returned to Massachusetts alone.
   After Ms. LaLonde refused to say where Nicole was, a judge
ordered her imprisoned until she revealed the child's location. She
spent six months in state prison.
   Ms. LaLonde was freed only after a baby sitter in Durham, N.C.,
tipped police that the child was being sheltered by an underground
network of women.
   Nicole was brought back to the state in October 1987, and was
placed by the state with a foster family.
   Ms. Fitzpatrick said Wednesday that the child still faces
considerable difficulties.
   ``Nicole will, in all likelihood, spend her forseeable future in
therapy attempting to understand her traumatic past and make some
sort of peace with parents who cannot cooperate,'' the judge said.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Thursday formally charged
six Lebanese men with conspiring to assassinate Lebanese Christian
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The six were arrested in the southern port of Larnaca last month
after scuba divers stumbled across two shoulder-fired SA-7
anti-aircraft missiles hidden underwater near the coastal airport.
   The missiles lacked only their firing pins, which were discovered
along with a cache of weapons in a seaside apartment where most of
the men were arrested. The weapons included five Kalashnikov rifles,
17 magazines and 28 hand grenades.
   In addition to the conspiracy charge, they face seven other
charges including illegal weapons possession. Five of the men are
accused of illegally entering Cyprus.
   Police said the seven planned to shoot down a Lebanese helicopter
that was to carry Aoun to Larnaca airport for a flight to Morocco
for an Arab summit in late May. Aoun did not attend the meeting.
   The six are identified as Tawfiq Wadih Ashaar, 27; Idris Jamal
Jaber, 27; Wadih Salim Salamon, 27; Ruston Najib Sirhan, 29; Salal
Khafarsi, 27; and Emil Gharali, 27.
   The preliminary hearing is set for June 30. All six have been in
custody in Nicosia Central prison.

   Andreas Papandreou, the outgoing premier,
was hospitalized Thursday after doctors said he was suffering from a
respiratory infection.
   Papandreou, 70, who underwent triple bypass heart surgery in
September, was reported by his doctors to be in excellent condition
after he entered the General State hospital in the Athens suburb of
Holargos.
   ``His admission was for reasons of a fuller examination and his
condition is excellent. His sickness does not prevent execution of
his duties,'' said a statement signed by doctors Dimitri Kremastinos
and Nicos Gannos.
   Wearing a jacket and tie and accompanied by his mistress, former
airline hostess Dimitra Liani, Papandreou smiled and waved to about
200 supporters gathered at the entrance to the hospital.
   Papandreou's four children, George, Nicholas, Andreas and Sophia,
as well as former ministers in his outgoing socialist
administration, were among the well wishers.
   Hospital administrative director, Giorgos Papastratis, told
journalists that Papandreou would spend the night and that a medical
announcement on his condition would be released Friday.
   Papandereou led Greece for eight years, but his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement failed in elections Sunday to win a third
consecutive four-year term, taking 125 seats in the 300-seat
Parliament.
   The conservative New Democracy emerged the winner with 145 seats.
The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of the Greek
Communist Party and the small Eurocommunist Left, won 28 seats.

<HEAD>Rare Corporate Manslaughter Charge Over Ferry Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court issued manslaughter summonses Thursday for
a shipping company, three of its former directors and four seamen
over the 1987 Zeebrugge ferry disaster in which 193 people died.
   A corporate manslaughter conviction can carry an unlimited fine,
while the seven men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
   The decision to prosecute P and O European Ferries was believed
by experts to be unprecedented. It capped more than two years of
court and police proceedings, a public inquiry that blamed the ship
owners, and an inquest that returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
   There was no immediate comment from the ferry company or the men
summoned.
   The Herald of Free Enterprise, a car-and-passenger ferry,
capsized outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in March 1987.
   Lawyers have disclosed that about two-thirds of the families
affected by the disaster have accepted a compensation package from P
and O, from $7,700 to the six-figure range, depending on the
family's circumstances and the contribution the victim made to the
family's income.
   Published reports have estimated the final payout will be at
least $6 million and as much as $23 million.
   An unidentified family that lost its breadwinner father was
granted $294,000 in a test case compensation settlement in the High
Court in January 1988.
   Facing prosecution are the ship's captain, David Lewry; First
Officer Leslie Sabel; Senior Master John Kirby, and Boatswain Mark
Stanley.
   Also summoned were Jeffrey Develine, Wallace Ayres and John
Alcindore, directors of owner Townsend Car Ferries Ltd., which is
now called P and O European Ferries. The corporate manslaughter
charge is against P and O European Ferries.
   The men summoned must appear before magistrates Aug. 1. The trial
is expected to begin next year.
   ``It's a pretty untested part of the law,'' said a spokeswoman
for the Crown Prosecution Service, which obtained the summonses at
Bow Street Magistrates Court in London.
   The spokeswoman, commenting on condition of anonymity, said that
except for a couple of cases in the 1920s, the state had never
brought a charge of this sort against a company.
   ``It's a complicated question because it is absolutely
unprecedented for this sort of case to go ahead,'' said Michael
Zander, professor of law at the London School of Economics.
   Maurice de Rohan, head of an association of families of the
disaster victims, welcomed the move, as did the opposition Labor
Party's transport spokesman John Prescott.
   ``It makes clear to all directors of companies that they have
corporate responsibility to see that the highest levels of safety
pertain in their areas of operation and they don't just blame the
workers,'' he said.
   The ship with an estimated 543 people aboard capsized because its
bow doors were open, letting in water that destabilized it, a public
inquiry concluded.
   Stanley, who allegedly left the doors open, was directly blamed,
while Lewry and Sabel were accused of serious negligence.
   Of Townsend Car Ferries Ltd., the inquiry report said: ``From top
to bottom, the body corporate was affected by the disease of
sloppiness,'' and guilt rested with ``all concerned in management.''
   An inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, and
police conducted a lengthy investigation.
   Last year, in an action brought by the families, a court ruled
that companies could be prosecuted for manslaughter.

<HEAD>18 Percent of Doctors Deny Some Care Due to Malpractice Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fear of malpractice lawsuits is leading some
doctors to turn away high-risk patients, a new Gallup poll shows.
   Fourteen percent of the 1,004 doctors surveyed nationwide said
they had denied service to as many as 10 high-risk patients in the
past year because of such fears, while 4 percent said they'd refused
to treat more than 10.
   More than three-fourths of the doctors polled _ 76 percent _ said
they didn't turn away any patients for fear of litigation.
   However, 35 percent said there are forms of medicine they don't
practice, despite being qualified, because of high liability
insurance costs.
   Thirty-nine percent of those surveyed said they believe indigent
patients are more likely than other patients to sue for malpractice,
but 22 percent said poor patients are less likely to sue.
   In a separate survey of public opinion, 48 percent of 1,500
adults polled said they believe ``people who sue physicians for
malpractice are just looking for an easy way to make money.''
   The results of the two surveys are published in Friday's American
Medical News, the weekly newspaper of the Chicago-based American
Medical Association.
   Dr. James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president, said the
results were troubling.
   ``I believe it is a critical comment on the state of our legal
system that even one patient would not receive care because
physicians feared being sued,'' Sammons told the publication.
   ``All of these factors _ declining high-risk patients, limiting
their type of practice, and believing indigent patients are more
likely to sue'' affect the public's ability to receive medical care,
he said.
   ``An even more damning indictment of our legal system is that
almost half of the public surveyed believe that people are just
looking for an easy way to make money,'' he said.
   The Gallup Organization conducted both polls.
   In the physicians' poll, the 1,004 U.S. doctors were chosen at
random and contacted by telephone from Jan. 19 through Feb. 8. The
margin of error was 3.5 percentage points, meaning answers could
vary by 3.5 percentage points either way.
   The public poll involved telephone interviews of 1,500 randomly
selected U.S. residents aged 18 and above during the last week of
January and the first week of February. The margin of error was 2.5
percentage points.
   The question about denying service to high-risk patients did not
define ``high-risk.''
   Dr. Kathleen Nolan of The Hastings Center, a medical-ethics think
tank near New York City, said some doctors might consider the term
to mean ``likely to sue,'' but most would probably define it as
medically risky, such as a case of a diabetic pregnant woman with
high blood pressure.
   In many such cases, it may be best for the patient if the doctor
refers the case to another physician because of possible
complications, the pediatrician and ethicist said.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Marxist Angola and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi shook hands Thursday
and agreed to end 14 years of civil war, reports said.
   The accord came at the end of an African summit on Angola
attended by 14 African heads of state.
   It provides for a cease-fire in Angola to start at midnight
Friday (7 p.m. Friday EDT), according to Zairian officials quoted by
the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   The meeting between dos Santos and Savimbi was their first since
the civil war began in 1975. Savimbi heads the U.S.-backed National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA.
   The reconciliation follows a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord
signed in New York in December under which South Africa agreed to
grant independence to Namibia and halt aid to Savimbi's rebels in
exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops backing dos
Santos' government.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the accord. The rebels are
not party to the agreement.
   Thursday's peace announcement was called the Declaration of
Gbadolite, after the town in northern Zaire where the summit was
held. It is the hometown of President Mobutu Sese Soko of Zaire and
lies 700 miles northeast of Kinshasa, the capital.
   A commission headed by Mobutu is to be established to bring about
national reconciliation in Angola.
   The historic handshake followed five hours of delay during which
hard talks took place, Zairian officials were quoted as saying.
   President Moussa Traore of Mali, head of the Organization of
African Unity, which held the summit, was quoted as saying in a
closing speech that a new page had been turned in African history:
   ``This brotherly handshake between Dr. Jonas Savimbi and
President dos Santos symbolizes the end of civil war in Angola,
which will open up a new era ... devoted to economic and social
development.''
   Reports said a snag developed until Savimbi agreed to remain in
his bush headquarters until elections, expected to be held in two
years.
   Earlier, he had refused to go into exile in the United States.
   ``We can now give Angola hope for peace, unity and development,''
Zambia's President Kenneth Kaunda said, according to the official
Portuguese news agency LUSA.
   In Washington, 19 members of Congress on Wednesday urged dos
Santos to negotiate wtih the rebels ``as the only means to end the
tragic civil war in Angola.''
   Kaunda said Savimbi promised at the meeting to abide by a
previous agreement to remain out of peace negotiations, according to
LUSA.
   That agreement broke a deadlock and brought Angola's government
to the conference table.
   Savimbi agreed in May he would not demand a role in any
transitional government on condition democratic elections are held
within two years.
   Major obstacles included dos Santos' insistence on maintaining
one-party rule while offering the rebels some positions in his
administration.
   The government offered rebels an amnesty and clemency, but the
guerrillas replied that the offer suggested their war was criminal
and so was unacceptable.
   Savimbi garners most of his support from the rural southern area
toward Namibia _ the Ovimbundu tribe, the biggest in Angola, and the
Ovambo. Dos Santos' power base is around northern Luanda, but his
followers are more diverse, coming from several smaller tribes.
   Dos Santos arrived ready to reconcile. Before leaving Luanda
earlier Thursday, he commuted death sentences of 50 rebels condemned
for high treason and terrorism between 1981-87, Angola's official
ANGOP news agency reported. On Wednesday, it said, the government
released 700 rebel prisoners who accepted an amnesty.
   Savimbi's guerrillas, armed by South Africa and the United
States, have been fighting to share power with Luanda's Cuban-backed
government since Angolan independence.
   Washington continues to arm the rebels and may have encouraged
the rebels to negotiate.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
said from Washington on Thursday that the United States ``helped
develop'' the Zaire summit.
   ``We may have a breakthrough,'' Cohen forecast earlier Thursday.
   Angola is twice the size of Texas, with 481,354 square miles, but
has only 8 million people. Most of them live in tribal villages and
rural areas. Nearly all the Portuguese fled in 1975, leaving Angola
more than 90 percent illiterate and badly in need of capital and
skilled workers.
   Oil fields in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda supply more than 90
percent of the nation's export earnings. Angola also has diamonds,
minerals and rich agricultural land, but the civil war has seriously
disrupted the economy.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says More Than 100 May Face Torture, Execution in Chad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Thursday more than 100
people in Chad have been arrested since an attempted coup in April
and may face torture and illegal execution.
   The human rights group said the detainees ``seem to have been
arrested arbitrarily because of their ethnic origin and their family
connections with other government opponents.''
   An Amnesty statement said all detainees were of the Zaghawa
ethnic group, which comes from the northeast portion of the former
French colony, and that the Chad government has disclosed nothing
about them.
   ``Amnesty International has received reports of both torture and
extra-judicial executions of suspected government opponents at
secret detention centers in N'djamena (the capital),'' the statement
said.
   Amnesty said it is ``therefore concerned, both that these
detainees may be subjected to torture and that their lives may be in
danger.''
   It named six of them, all brothers of Sidik Fadoul, former head
of military police in a coalition that governed Chad from 1979 to
1982.
   It said Fadoul was arrested in 1988 when he returned voluntarily
to Chad, having been personally assured by President Hissene Habre
that he would not be persecuted.
   It identified the brothers as Professor Zakaria Fadoul, head of
the linguistics department at the University of Chad; Saleh Fadoul,
a bank employee; Mahamat Fadoul, a Radio Chad journalist; Mahamat
Den Fadoul, a driver; and Ali and Yacoub Fadoul, both merchants.
   The coup leaders reportedly plotted a takeover after the Habre's
Anakaza tribe attempted to secure key government administrative and
military posts. The coup plotters hoped to maintain the Hadjarai and
Zakawa tribes in the government, sources said.
   According to Chad authorities, the coup attempt was made on April
1 and was led by Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat Itno, armed
forces chief Hassan Djamous and his predecessor, Idriss Debi.
   France and the United States consider Chad strategic because of
its position between Libya and Zaire and between Nigeria and Sudan.
France has sent troops to Chad twice since 1983 to head off Libyan
incursions.
   Habre has been president since 1982, when he ousted a
Libyan-backed government led by Goukouni Oueddei.
   Chad gained its independence from France in 1960.

<TEXT>
   The Wall Street Journal, the nation's first
national newspaper and a fixture in corporate America, began life
100 years ago as a 2-cent broadsheet hand-delivered in lower
Manhattan's business district to a few hundred readers.
   As it celebrates its centennial with a special edition Friday,
the Journal can boast a readership of 2 million, making it the
nation's largest newspaper, and a reputation as the daily diary of
capitalism.
   ``It's given us a common language with regard to how we look at
everything from markets to international trade,'' observed Everette
Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in New York.
   But even as the paper has grown and adjusted to the modern world
_ adding graphics and extra feature sections _ its virtual monopoly
on financial news eroded in recent years.
   A series of birthday bashes held this week cannot obscure the
challenges the paper faces as it heads into its second century:
Circulation has slipped, advertising revenue is down and new
competition has emerged for both readers and ad dollars.
   ``It still is by far the strongest and most profitable newspaper
franchise in the country,'' said John Morton, a media industry
analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan in Washington. ``But it's not as
strong and not as profitable as it used to be.''
   Advertising linage peaked in 1983 and has fallen by 7.5 percent
since, according to the Journal's figures. Circulation hit a high of
2.1 million at the end of 1983, but since then dropped to about 1.95
million.
   Also in the last few years, The New York Times launched a
national edition, USA Today had its nationwide rollout and most
metropolitan newspapers beefed up their business coverage, as did
the broadcast networks and cable television.
   Most of the ad decline stemmed from advertising cutbacks by banks
and financial institutions _ the Journal's biggest source of ads,
said Kenneth Burenga, general manager of the Journal and its parent,
Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc.
   Financial advertising began to slip long before the stock market
crash of October 1987, due to Wall Street mergers that reduced the
number of investment houses, Burenga said.
   Circulation was crimped by a reduction in the number of middle
managers and executives _ the paper's prime readers _ in the wave of
mergers, takeovers and corporate restructurings of the 1980s,
Burenga said.
   The Journal struck back by adding a third section last fall and
starting special columns on real estate, media, marketing, law,
technology and other topics. It also upgraded its coverage of the
arts.
   Some have questioned whether this expansion has weakened the
Journal's focus. Norman Pearlstine, the Journal's managing editor,
disagrees.
   ``We've always felt that while we are a business newspaper, that
our readers have interests in more than just business,'' he said.
   Pearlstine views the broader coverage as another step in the
Journal's evolution from a paper serving Wall Street traders to a
national daily.
   The Journal began on July 8, 1889, as a four-page afternoon
paper. The first edition included brief reports on the New York,
Boston and Philadelphia stock exchanges and numerous items on
railroad companies, then a major force in American business.
   Much of the shape of today's Journal is the work of the late
Bernard ``Barney'' Kilgore, the newspaper's legendary former
managing editor who began his 38-year Journal career in 1929.
   Under Kilgore, the paper launched its trademark front-page
feature stories _ called leaders _ and its in-depth reports, along
with stories about trends and issues shaping the business world and
society.
   Kilgore stressed that business stories need not be written in the
arcane language of business. ``Don't write banking stories for
bankers,'' he told reporters. ``Write for the banks' customers.''
   The Journal is unusual in many ways: Although it has run an
occasional photograph, it prefers to illustrate stories with
drawings, and it is one of the few big papers to eschew the color
explosion.
   Its front-page design of six vertical columns is virtually cast
in stone. Notable exceptions were on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after
the Black Monday stock market crash, and the day after the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor.
   Pearlstine says highlights of his 20 years at the paper include
the two Pulitzer Prizes the Journal won last year, increasing to 13
the number of Pulitzers it has been awarded.
   The nadir, he said, was the scandal involving former Journal
reporter R. Foster Winans, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison
in 1985 for securities fraud.
   Winans was convicted of tipping stock traders to the contents of
the Wall Street column he wrote for the paper before it appeared in
print. In exchange, Winans received a share of any profit they made
from market-affecting news.
   Pearlstine credited the Journal's thorough coverage of the
scandal for restoring the paper's credibility.
   Journal executives and industry analysts say the Journal's
circulation and advertising setbacks are temporary.
   ``They've had these kinds of problems before, and once the
advertising economy gets through these things, the Journal will once
more prosper,'' said Morton.

   A plane carrying 60 people slammed into a
mountain in the Andes, reportedly splitting in half, and all aboard
were killed, the air force said Thursday.
   The aircraft, an air force plane, crashed near the town of Tarma
100 miles east of Lima Wednesday, according to a communique.
   Earlier Thursday, Gen. Edgar Sullca Flores, police chief of
Huancayo city in the central highlands, said the plane was carrying
42 people, including crew and passengers.
   Peasants from Uyubamba village said they watched the aircraft
break into two from the eastern mountain slopes, Flores said.
   The communique said 42 of the victims had been identified. An air
force spokesman said no foreigners were among the passengers.
   The air force did not say how many of the dead were civilians and
how many were military personnel. The communique did not indicate
what might have caused the crash.
   The aircraft, a Canadian-made Buffalo bimotor cargo plane
converted to passenger service, left the jungle town of San Ramon,
126 miles northeast of Lima.
   The air force provides passenger service on its planes to remote
towns in Peru's eastern Amazon jungle because the routes are not
profitable for civilian airlines.
   Also Wednesday, an Aeroperu jetliner made an emergency landing at
Lima's international airport on a flight from Cuzco.
   Airport officials said the landing gear on the plane, a DC-8,
would not come down. The aircraft circled the airport for more than
an hour, consuming its remaining fuel to reduce the chances of fire
during the emergency landing.
   The aircraft finally was able to land without any of the 148
passengers suffering injuries.
   Aeroperu is a government-owned airline.
   Six civilian and military planes have crashed in Peru in the past
two years.
   Critics blame most accidents on poor maintenance because of a
shortage of spare parts.
   Peru is suffering its worst recession in history, weighed down by
annual inflation of more than 5,000 percent.

<HEAD>Solidarity Citizens Committee To Focus on Building Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity Citizens Committee, which
ran the union's campaign for the new parliament, decided Thursday
not to disband now that elections are over, patching a dispute that
threated to split the opposition.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the union's National Executive
Commission advocated closing the local Citizens Committee so that
activists nationwide could concentrate on rebuilding the Solidarity
trade union itself.
   But activists strongly disagreed, and after a daylong debtate
passed two vaguely worded resolutions that Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said meant local groups could continue
to exist for now.
   About 120 members of the national Citizens Committee _ set up in
December by Walesa to advise the union on political, social and
economic issues _ gathered in a Warsaw University auditorium for the
debate.
   During the debate, Walesa defended a weekend resolution by the
union's Executive Commission to concentrate efforts on rebuilding
the East bloc's first independent trade union, which regained legal
status April 17.
   Union organizing took a back seat during the election campaign.
   But the final resolution thanked the local Citizens Committees,
which helped Solidarity to its overwhelming election victory, and
said they should help prepare for free municipal elections, a
Solidarity goal.
   The executive's resolution to dissolve the local committees
``should not be treated as something that should be implemented
immediately,'' Onyszkiewicz said. ``Today's resolution ... says one
should approach their transformation with flexibility,'' he said.
   ``The Citizens Committee is of the opinion that the main task at
the present moment is expanding and strengthening the Solidarity
trade union and Farmers Solidarity as guarantors of democratic
reforms in our country,'' it said.
   A 14-member commission was appointed to present proposals on the
future of the national Citizens Committee by Sept. 10.
   Walesa appeared concerned the continued existence of the
committees would drain strength from rebuilding the union.
   ``Today if we get divided into two ... we weaken the most
important stream and the most important stream today is the broad
stream of working people,'' he said.
   A top adviser to Walesa who opposed disbanding the committees
tried to downplay conflict.
   ``First of all we want to say in the current situation that we
maintain unity, that we are able to maintain it and that there is no
conflict between the Citizens Committee and the bodies of the
union,'' said Bronislaw Geremek.
   The weekend decision was greeted with anger from members of the
local committees, flush with their electoral triumph, which saw
Solidarity win 99 of of 100 seats in the freely contested Senate in
June 4 and June 18 elections. Solidarity also won all seats
available to it in the lower house, the Sejm.
   Critics said the decision was to prevent the committees in each
of Poland's 49 provinces from becoming parallel, possibly rival
organizations to Solidarity.
   The dispute reflected contradictions within Solidarity over
whether it is ultimately a trade union or a political movement and
whether it will be led by workers or intellectuals.
   Walesa has said Solidarity should be mainly a union, with
politics eventually shifted to newly emerging political groups.
   But Solidarity nevertheless has a broad following among
non-workers _ students, intellectuals and professionals _ who are
more interested in pressing communist authorities for democratic
political changes.

<TEXT>
   Four workers in a disciplinary program
for ghetto children received maximum 20-year sentences Thursday for
beating their leader's 8-year-old daughter to death.
   Ecclesia Athletic Association leader Eldridge Broussard Jr.,
making his first appearance in court during the trial, pleaded
unsuccessfully for the release of the four pending an appeal.
   Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego and Brian J. Brinson, 31,
Frederick P. Doolittle, 28, and Constance Z. Jackson, 38, all of Los
Angeles, were convicted of first-degree manslaughter May 12 in the
death of Dayna Broussard.
   Dayna endured hundreds of blows for stealing food from another
child Oct. 13, according to testimony.
   Several children forced to witness the discipline session
testified that Dayna was slammed against a wall, kicked, tripped,
slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit upon and hung
out a window.
   Jackson, who beat five other Ecclesia children with an electrical
cord, was convicted June 5 of five counts each of second-degree
assault and first-degree criminal mistreatment.
   Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe sentenced Jackson to 10
years in prison, to be served after the manslaughter sentence, on
that conviction. She will be eligible for parole in seven years.
   Defense lawyers asked that their clients receive light sentences
since none had criminal records. But prosecutor Alfred J. French III
urged the maximum penalty for all four.
   Chambers, who got the stiffest penalty of the four, will be
eligible for parole in 10 years.
   The 50 or more blows dealt by Chambers were mainly to blame for
the girl's death, Lowe said.
   Chambers described Dayna during the trial as ``a strong-willed,
strong-bodied world-class athlete,'' Lowe recalled. ``But she was
not yet a world-class athlete. She was an 8-year-old girl.''
   Jackson was convicted of striking and biting Dayna.
   ``It took more guts for Dayna Broussard to bite you in the leg
than for a prisoner of war to spit in the face of her captors,''
Lowe told her.
   Brinson and Doolittle, who held the girl down, will each have to
serve 40 months before being eligible for parole.
   ``No human being could have participated without asking, `Hasn't
this gone far enough?''' Lowe said of the two.
   Defense attorney Ron Thom said the sentences will be appealed.
   Broussard, who testified under a 1987 law that allows crime
victims or their families to speak at sentencing, broke down once
during his rambling, 20-minute testimony.
   ``I'm walking a tightrope,'' he explained to the court.
   ``When I don't show any emotion, I'm inhuman,'' Broussard said.
``(When I do express my feelings), people think I'm faking. I would
like to assure you my daughter's loss is serious to me.''
   He declined to comment after the sentencing.
   Broussard, 35, formed Ecclesia in Los Angeles' tough Watts area
to steer ghetto children away from drugs and crime and toward
rigorous athletic training.
   He criticized the news media Thursday for calling his
organization a cult, and portraying him as ``a madman or someone who
doesn't have any sense.''
   Broussard was in Los Angeles at the time of the beating at a
farmhouse east of Portland. He has denied all along that Dayna was
beaten, saying that children in the group were spanked as part of
the group's strict disciplinary policy.
   Fifty-three children 6 weeks to 16 years old were taken into
state protective custody after Dayna's death. They are living with
foster parents or with relatives.

   President Bush issued a strong personal dissent
Thursday to the Supreme Court decision overturning flag-desecration
laws, declaring that ``flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.''
   Bush, who made the flag a major issue in his 1988 campaign,
commented as he unveiled a nationwide volunteer program and asked
Congress to appropriate $100 million for it over the next four years.
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
administration's response to the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in China.
   ``We feel the administration has spoken out loudly, strongly and
without reservation on this issue,'' Fitzwater said. ``We've spoken
out forcefully, more than any other country in the world.''
   The president also met with homeless youths in a center near
Times Square, where one young woman told him the minimum wage was so
low that it was more profitable to sell drugs.
   ``It's hard to get good jobs,'' a 20-year-old Covenant House
resident identified only as Monique said, suggesting that it was
more profitable to sell drugs. ``Working in McDonald's _ at the
minimum wage _ it just doesn't pay.''
   Bush vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage from
$3.35 an hour to $4.55, saying that figure was too high.
   In a speech to New York business and community leaders, Bush
departed from his prepared text on the volunteerism program to
comment on Wednesday's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling.
   He stopped short of directly criticizing the court, saying he
understood the legal basis of the decision.
   ``But, I have to give you my personal, emotional response,'' Bush
said. ``Flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.''
   He was applauded vigorously by the luncheon crowd of about 1,000
when he concluded: ``The flag of the United States is very, very
special.''
   Bush frequently symbolically wrapped himself in the flag during
last year's campaign, even giving a speech outside a New Jersey flag
factory.
   He repeatedly attacked his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, for having vetoed a school pledge of
allegiance law.
   The court's decision restricts the power of states to punish
those who burn or otherwise desecrate an American flag.
   Bush borrowed from another campaign theme, his ``thousand points
of light,'' in continuing to trumpet the theme of volunteerism he
has heralded all week.
   He announced that he would serve as honorary chairman of a
``Points of Light Foundation'' to oversee volunteer efforts, and
that New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean would head the foundation's advisory
committee.
   Bush said he would ask Congress for $25 million a year over the
next four years to support the non-profit independent organization,
which will solicit matching funds from the private sector.
   Kean, who said Bush had asked him to head the committee Wednesday
night, said specific uses for the funding had not been decided.
   ``This is what I mean when I talk of a thousand points of light:
That vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to
solve problems in their own back yard,'' Bush said.
   He first used the ``points of light'' phrase at last summer's
Republican convention.
   The president called on all individuals, businesses and
institutions to join in the volunteer effort, saying corporations
should set up literacy programs to make sure each employee can read
and that restaurants and grocery stores should distribute surplus
food to soup kitchens and local shelters.
   In remarks at a New York State Republican dinner, Bush turned to
politics, saying that New York voters, ``in particular minority and
ethnic voters, are shifting from automatic loyalty to the other
party and voting Republican more and more often.''
   ``We are justly proud of how far we've come as a party _ so far
that we now have a good chance of winning the mayor's office in New
York City, the most powerful local office in America.''
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani is a leading candidate in
the Republican effort to oust incumbent Democratic Mayor Ed Koch.
   At a 100th anniversary celebration for the Wall Street Journal,
Bush praised the publication.
   ``In a changing world that offers 64 channels of cable
television, the six columns of the Wall Street Journal are as
familiar as the morning coffee at our breakfast tables,'' he said.
   He called the Journal ``one of America's most trusted
publications,'' but joked that ``not every article was a Pulitzer
Prize winner. In 1967, a front page story on China predicted the
communist government wouldn't last the year.''
   The president said he actually likes ``because you don't carry
Doonesbury,'' the comic strip that frequently lampoons Bush. The
Journal carries no comic strips.
   He also returned to his main theme of the day of volunteerism,
noting that some of the nation's top corporate executives were in
the audience.
   ``It is my request _ I believe, your obligation _ to donate the
services of the talented and the enterprising within your ranks.
Many are doing this now. Everyone should do this.''

   A fuel truck spill forced President Bush to
change his route out of New York City Thursday night.
   Air Force One flew from Newark International Airport in New
Jersey to John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens borough of New York
because of concerns by security officials about the accident near
the Newark airport, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters.
   Bush delayed the departure of his motorcade from a banquet in
downtown Manhattan to let Secret Service escorts and New York City
police chart a new course to the Kennedy Airport.
   ``There has been an accident involving two fuel trucks near the
Newark airport,`` Fitzwater told reporters outside the building
where the president and Mrs. Bush had attended the 100th anniversary
dinner of the Wall Street Journal.
   Fitzwater said he was not sure what the trucks carried but
``whatever they are they are considered toxic, especially when
considered mixed.''
   ``For those reasons we have been advised to move Air Force One
and the press plane to another location,'' he added.
   Bush had flown to Newark on Air Force One Thursday morning to
visit a shelter for runaway youth and to call for a crusade to spur
volunteerism in a speech before a civic group.

   Members of a radical group set an
American flag afire Thursday, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court
affirmed their right to do so.
   Outside the University of California at Berkeley, members of a
group called the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade called the
burning of the national banner ``a celebration'' and referred to the
flag and the United States in profane terms.
   Elsewhere, however, congressmen and New York's mayor decried the
high court's ruling that burning the flag was protected by the right
to free speech. In Alabama, military veterans reacted with shock and
dismay.
   The high court on Wednesday ruled 5-4 in favor of Gregory
``Joey'' Johnson, who torched the flag during a protest at the 1984
Republican Convention in Dallas. He appealed a one-year sentence and
a $2,000 fine.
   The decision of the Supreme Court knocked down anti-flag
desecration laws in 48 states.
   In Washington, D.C., Sen. Pete Wilson, introduced a joint
resolution that proposed a constitutional amendment ``to protect the
dignity of the U.S. flag.''
   The Bill of Rights, whose first article protects freedom of
speech, ``should not imply the right to desecrate the flag,'' said
Wilson, a Republican from California.
   New York's Mayor Edward Koch also said that the Constitution
should be amended to prohibit such political expression.
   ``We were shocked that the law of the country now is that you can
burn a flag with impunity,'' he said.
   In Montgomery, Ala., Gordon Shewmake, state adjutant
quartermaster of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he didn't
understand why anyone would want to burn the flag.
   ``People have died for that piece of cloth,'' he said. ``If they
don't like our flag, they can go live under another flag and I don't
think they'd like that at all.''
   Shewmake, a 23-year Air Force veteran, said he was proud to see
the American flag while serving overseas during the occupation of
Japan after World War II and in Korea and Vietnam.
   But a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama
said the decision correctly interpreted the First Amendment
guarantee of free speech.
   Martin McCaffrey, vice president of the state Civil Liberties
Union board of directors, said the decision was not an issue of
patriotism but of civil rights.
   ``The same First Amendment that protects your right to wave the
flag protects your right to burn the flag,'' McCaffrey said.

   The Solidarity Citizens Committee, which
ran the union's campaign for the new parliament, decided Thursday
not to disband now that elections are over, patching a dispute that
threated to split the opposition.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the union's National Executive
Commission advocated closing the local Citizens Committee so that
activists nationwide could concentrate on rebuilding the Solidarity
trade union itself.
   But activists strongly disagreed, and after a daylong debtate
passed two vaguely worded resolutions that Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said meant local groups could continue
to exist for now.
   About 120 members of the national Citizens Committee _ set up in
December by Walesa to advise the union on political, social and
economic issues _ gathered in a Warsaw University auditorium for the
debate.
   During the debate, Walesa defended a weekend resolution by the
union's Executive Commission to concentrate efforts on rebuilding
the East bloc's first independent trade union, which regained legal
status April 17.
   Union organizing took a back seat during the election campaign.
   But the final resolution thanked the local Citizens Committees,
which helped Solidarity to its overwhelming election victory, and
said they should help prepare for free municipal elections, a
Solidarity goal.
   The executive's resolution to dissolve the local committees
``should not be treated as something that should be implemented
immediately,'' Onyszkiewicz said. ``Today's resolution ... says one
should approach their transformation with flexibility,'' he said.
   ``The Citizens Committee is of the opinion that the main task at
the present moment is expanding and strengthening the Solidarity
trade union and Farmers Solidarity as guarantors of democratic
reforms in our country,'' it said.
   A 14-member commission was appointed to present proposals on the
future of the national Citizens Committee by Sept. 10.
   Walesa appeared concerned the continued existence of the
committees would drain strength from rebuilding the union.
   ``Today if we get divided into two ... we weaken the most
important stream and the most important stream today is the broad
stream of working people,'' he said.
   A top adviser to Walesa who opposed disbanding the committees
tried to downplay conflict.
   ``First of all we want to say in the current situation that we
maintain unity, that we are able to maintain it and that there is no
conflict between the Citizens Committee and the bodies of the
union,'' said Bronislaw Geremek.
   The weekend decision was greeted with anger from members of the
local committees, flush with their electoral triumph, which saw
Solidarity win 99 of of 100 seats in the freely contested Senate in
June 4 and June 18 elections. Solidarity also won all seats
available to it in the lower house, the Sejm.
   Critics said the decision was to prevent the committees in each
of Poland's 49 provinces from becoming parallel, possibly rival
organizations to Solidarity.
   The dispute reflected contradictions within Solidarity over
whether it is ultimately a trade union or a political movement and
whether it will be led by workers or intellectuals.
   Walesa has said Solidarity should be mainly a union, with
politics eventually shifted to newly emerging political groups.
   But Solidarity nevertheless has a broad following among
non-workers _ students, intellectuals and professionals _ who are
more interested in pressing communist authorities for democratic
political changes.

   Hurricane Cosme roared into Mexico's Pacific
coast with 87 mph winds and heavy rains, then lost its punch and was
downgraded to a tropical storm, officials said Thursday.
   Officials reported no serious damage or injuries.
   Cosme, the season's second hurricane, hit land Wednesday night,
Mexico's National Weather Service said. The areas hardest hit were
along the coast between Puerto Escondido, about 300 miles southwest
of Mexico City, and Acapulco, about 250 miles south of the capital,
it said.
   The storm moved inland Thursday morning and became a tropical
storm, the weather reports said.
   Leandro Hernaandez, weather service spokesman for Oaxaca state,
where Puerto Escondido is located, said heavy rains continued in the
area through Thursday morning.
   Authorities evacuated 260 families from their homes Wednesday
night in a low-lying Acapulco slum near the Perro River as a
precaution against flooding, the government news agency Notimex said.
   Port officials said the ports of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido
were closed Wednesday afternoon as a precautionary measure and
remained closed Thursday afternoon.
   The first hurricane of the season was Barbara off northwestern
Baja California earlier this week, the weather service said. It
caused no serious damage.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Thursday night approved a compromise
bill to remove the remaining wellhead price controls from natural
gas.
   The House-Senate compromise was cleared in the Senate by a voice
vote. The House must take final action on the bill before it can be
sent to President Bush, who is expected to sign it.
   The legislation is designed to remove all federal price controls
on natural gas by Jan. 1, 1993. It is not expected to affect retail
prices much because most gas under controls already is selling below
the official ceilings.
   The Senate's action came two days after House and Senate
negotiators agreed that gas from wells drilled after the date of
enactment of the bil would be deregulated on May 15, 1991. All other
gas not already decontrolled would be freed from the federal
ceilings when sales contracts are renegotiated or Jan. 1, 1993,
whichever comes first.
   About two-thirds of the nation's natural gas was freed from
controls in 1978.

   A congressman said Thursday that death
squads, possibly hired by drug traffickers, are hunting down members
of the governing Liberal Party.
   Rep. Jorge Infante Leal said in a communique sent to Liberal
leaders that more than 100 members were killed in the eastern plains
in the last year.
   The Defense Ministry confirmed his statements. The ministry said
previously that guerrillas of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed
Forces are targeting Liberal Party members.
   The guerrillas may be taking revenge for right-wing death squads
killing more than 800 members of Colombia's biggest leftist party,
the Patriotic Union, in four years.
   But El Tiempo newspaper quoted the congressman as saying he is
not entirely convinced that guerrillas are behind the killings of
Liberal Party members.
   Infante Leal said the gunmen could be hired by drug traffickers
who are killing Liberals because a Liberal faction has sought an
alliance with the Patriotic Union.
   Drug runners have been at war with guerrillas here for years
because of rebel attempts to kidnap drug traffickers or members of
their families and hold them for ransom.
   Also, drug traffickers resent guerrilla demands of payment of a
so-called revolution tax in areas where traffickers raise coca
plants for producing cocaine or where the traffickers have ranches,
national police have said.
   The Liberal Party members have been killed in Guaviare, Meta and
Vichada states, areas where coca bushes are grown in abundance and
where the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces have an estimated
5,000 guerrillas.

   A woman desperate for money to buy
crack cocaine stole $5 from a 7-year-old boy who was on his way to
the supermarket to pick up sausage and a loaf of bread, police said.
   Barbara Jean Malone, 29, of Delray Beach was being held Thursday

   Malone was caught by police Tuesday a few moments after she
allegedly shoved Christopher Moore against a wall and robbed him of
the $5 his mother gave him to buy food.
   ``That never happened to me before,'' Christopher, a first-grader
at Banyan Creek Elementary School, said Wednesday. ``I was crying. I
don't want to go up there anymore.''
   The sobbing boy ran to a police car at a nearby gas station, then
he and the officers drove around the neighborhood looking for the
robber. Police said Malone's actions were caused by her addiction to
crack cocaine.

<HEAD>Leader Defends China's Version Of Crackdown, Criticizes Hungarian
Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of East Germany's Communist Party, one of
the most rigid in the Soviet bloc, on Thursday defended China's
official version of the crackdown on pro-democracy activists.
   Joachim Herrmann, a member of the party's policy-making
Politburo, also denounced democratic reform in Hungary and backed
the Berlin Wall.
   Herrmann, who also serves as secretary of the party's Central
Committee, made his comments in a Politburo report he read to a
Central Committee meeting on foreign policy.
   Speaking about the violent suppression of student demonstrators
in China, Herrmann said East Germany has published all official
Chinese statements with the purpose of denying ``Western horror
stories'' and to present ``objective information.''
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the death
toll in the June 3-4 crackdown may have been as high as 3,000. The
Chinese government's most recent report says 100 soldiers and 100
civilians died. Most East Germans are able to watch West German
television.
   Herrmann, whose speech was distributed by the government-run news
agency ADN, said the ``peaceful student demonstrations'' in Beijing
were intended to be used for a ``counter-revolutionary overthrow of
people's power in China.''
   The Politburo makes all key decisions in East Germany and its
report expresses the views of the country's aging leaders, led by
Erich Honecker, head of the party.
   The party has strongly resisted Soviet-style economic and
political reforms, and Herrmann's speech reaffirmed the country's
leading hard-line position in the Soviet bloc.
   The Politburo report said East Germany will remain true to its
own policies and made no hints at any reforms.
   Hungary's Communist Party and opposition groups have agreed to
hold multi-party elections by next summer. Last week, hundreds of
thousands of Hungarians turned out for an emotional reburial of Imre
Nagy, the communist leader executed after leading a revolt crushed
by Soviet troops in 1956.
   ``Under the flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work that
strive for the removal of socialism. In this connection, the
developments in Hungary fill us with great concern,'' Herrmann said.
   He accused Western leaders whom he did not identify of stepping
up ideological and economic pressure on communist countries in an
attempt to make them reject communism and turn to capitalism.
   Herrmann said the Berlin Wall will continue to protect East
Germany from ``economic plundering, from the penetration of criminal
elements ... and from drug smuggling.''
   He said the Berlin Wall will remain as long as the ``reasons that
led to its construction remain.'' East Germany claims it built the
wall to prevent a possible attack or infiltration from the West.
   However, Western governments agree that East Germany built the
wall at Soviet insistence to stop the massive flow of refugees from
East to West.
   President Bush, in a speech during a visit to West Germany this
month, challenged East Germany to tear down the Berlin Wall.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev noted that ``nothing is
eternal'' and that the wall was not ``a great problem'' in East-West
relations, but he did not call for its removal when he visited West
Germany last week.

   A 23-year-old suspect in the slayings of
his parents and two other relatives was shot and killed by state
police Thursday after he opened fire, ending a six-hour standoff,
authorities said.
   Eben McDowell, 23, of Stamford was killed around 5 p.m. at a
Schoharie County farm, where he'd fled after his father, mother,
brother and grandfather were killed Wednesday in neighboring
Delaware County, officials said.
   The four were shot to death at the grandfather's cabin in woods
just outside Stamford, about 50 miles southwest of Albany, said
Delaware County Sheriff Paul Peterson.
   The grandfather, Charles Klepetar, 78, was found shot in his bed.
Attorney Robert H. McDowell, 59, and his 22-year-old son Daniel were
found at the edge of a pond near the cabin, and his wife, Elizabeth,
48, was found in the pond, Peterson said. She had apparently been
trying to flee.
   The bodies were discovered Thursday morning by a social worker
who'd found a note Eben McDowell left on the front door of his
father's Stamford law office, said Peterson.
   ``The note on the office door of the law office was written in
third person to make it look like his father did it,'' Peterson said.
   A police helicopter tracked Eben McDowell to a pond a few miles
north of the crime scene and a half-mile away from the family's home.
   Police cornered McDowell there around 11 a.m., and had been
trying to persuade him to surrender when he started shooting,
Peterson said.
   People who knew the suspect said he had a history of getting into
trouble.
   ``He got into his share of trouble as a kid, just as any kid
would, but in the last few years he really went bad,'' said Fred
Hyatt, who employed McDowell three years ago at a Stamford lumber
yard.
   The slayings shocked residents of this town of less than 2,000
people.
   ``I couldn't believe it when I heard about it. I was just sick,''
said diner owner John DeLeo. ``I just can't figure it out. They were
beautiful people.''
   Robert McDowell was involved in many community affairs, while
Elizabeth McDowell volunteered to tend flowers along Stamford's main
street, residents said.
   ``They were a very respected family,'' said Stamford resident
Donna Williams.

   Children across the country have put up
allowances and revenues from Kool-Aid stands to raise more than
$2,000 for a crippled cub named Billy the Bear, who needs an
operation.
   ``Never have we had this kind of attention with an animal,'' said
Dave Siddon, whose Wildlife Images rehabilitation center cares for
wild animals ranging from pygmy owls to cougars.
   Weighing just 10 pounds, the black bear was found as an orphan a
month ago west of Redding, Calif.
   ``He was caught by a dog,'' Siddon said. ``His legs were
dislocated. He needs an operation to put them back in place.''
   Rushell Ritualo of Renton, Wash., wrote after seeing a story on
television about Billy's plight that she had planned to buy art
supplies with her allowance, ``but I heard about you and I wanted to
give it to you for your operation.''
   Letters also came from around Oregon, California, Colorado, South
Dakota, North Dakota, Kansas, Idaho, Florida and Nevada.
   A boy named Ryan from Denver sent $1. ``It's only a buck but we
care,'' he wrote.
   Locally, a girl contributed $2.85 she raised at her Kool-Aid
stand.
   Siddon said a little more than $2,000 in donations, mostly from
children, have come in for Billy, who drinks from a baby bottle and
wears a pair of toddler's footed pajamas.
   Siddon has contacted a number of veterinarians and physicians
about performing the operation and hopes to have a CAT scan of the
injury. He said he did not know how much the surgery would cost but
expected it would run into thousands of dollars.
   Siddon did not know how soon the operation could be performed,
but he said if all goes well, Billy will be returned to the wild.

<HEAD>Babysitter Says Hurt Referred to Jennings as His Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former babysitter testified Thursday that actor
William Hurt referred to the mother of his son as his wife while
having lunch with the child in a pizza parlor in the summer of 1985.
   Linda Patrick, who said she had met Hurt for the first time,
testified on the fourth day of a trial to determine whether the
actor had a common-law marriage in South Carolina with former
ballerina Sandra Jennings.
   ``How do you like working with my wife?'' she quoted Hurt as
asking about Jennings, mother of Hurt's son, Alexander, now 6.
   The babysitter said that occasionally when she went for walks
with the boy, people would come up and say, ``How is Mrs. Hurt?''
That comment was stricken from the record because it was not given
in response to a question.
   Jennings, 32, bases her claim of a common-law marriage on four
weeks she spent with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., from Dec. 9, 1982, when
he learned he was divorced from actress Mary Beth Hurt, to Jan. 10,
1983, when Hurt and Jennings left the state. Hurt was filming ``The
Big Chill'' there at the time.
   Jennings now seeks to have the court declare that she and Hurt
are married so she can get a ``divorce'' and a share of his assets,
estimated by her lawyer, A. Richard Golub, to be about $10 million.
   Patrick was another of several witnesses who have testified that
Hurt called Jennings his wife, but no one has said he made such a
reference during the four-week period in South Carolina on which
Jennings' claim is based.
   South Carolina recognizes common-law marriages; New York does not.
   The trial continues on Monday, when it is expected to conclude.

   Free speech advocates are hailing a Supreme
Court ruling in a Texas flag-burning case they say fortifies and
expands constitutional protection for political dissent.
   But conservatives and veterans groups expressed anger and sadness.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote Wednesday, said burning the American
flag as a form of political protest is protected by the
Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   The court said Texas authorities violated a protester's rights
when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or
destruction of the flag. The justices upheld a lower court ruling
that overturned the protester's conviction, one-year prison term and
$2,000 fine.
   Professor Martin Redish of Northwestern University said the
ruling means ``the government cannot censor a viewpoint based on its
offensiveness.''
   But H.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, national commander of the American
Legion, said, ``As a veteran my first reaction to the decision is
one of anger. Then my anger turns to extreme sadness. This is a sad
day for the United States of America.''

<HEAD>State Tries To Shut Down Hazardous Waste Handler</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A little company on a steamy bayou, Marine
Shale Processors, raked in millions using what it said was a
revolutionary process to turn toxic waste into glassy black rubble
it sold for construction projects.
   Last year, it handled wastes from more than 2,500 companies in 48
states.
   Meanwhile, residents of St. Mary Parish accuse the company of
cancer-causing pollution. State environmental officials have levied
over $5 million in fines and last month halted sale of its black
``aggregate.'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., held hearings on Marine
Shale last year and two federal grand juries reportedly have studied
it.
   This month, the company laid off nearly a fourth of its 400
employees.
   Competitors, who call the process a sham, say the end is near.
   But Jack Kent, Marine Shale's fiery-tempered president, vows he
won't shut down without a long and costly fight. ``Anybody with
half-way brains would know this is a much better process to handle
this material than any other method in the country today ... or in
the world today,'' he said.
   ``As far as we're concerned, Marine Shale is on death row. It's
just a matter of hooking up the juice,'' said Richard Fortuna of the
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, a Washington-based lobbying group
for Rollins Environmental Services and other waste handlers whose
prices were undercut.
   Marine Shale began burning hazardous waste in its 275-foot long
kiln in 1985, charging up to $300 per 55-gallon drum to take toxic
materials from those who produce them. Kent says that's about half
what others charged. It sold its aggregate, as fill for roadbeds and
boat slips, for $1 a ton.
   ``MSP gross revenues for the first quarter 1989 are the highest
ever!'' boasts a flier in the office. Kent said that translates to
roughly $22 million.
   Profit ordinarily would run 15 percent, he said, but millions in
legal fees are making a healthy dent. And business has dropped off
50 percent, he said, since the May 26 order banning sale of Marine
Shale aggregate.
   The Hazardous Waste Treatment Council says the huge,
computer-monitored kiln is nothing more than a glorified
incinerator. Fortuna said Marine Shale skirted environmental laws by
calling itself a recycler instead of a disposer.
   Marine Shale countered that it was operating under some of the
nation's strictest air and water permits _ stricter than those for a
Rollins incinerator at Baton Rouge. Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality officials backed that claim, though the agency
has accused the company of frequently violating the permits and is
trying to have them revoked.
   The state has complained of sloppy storage, violation of air
quality standards and refusal to move an allegedly dangerous storage
barge off Bayou Bouef alongside the plant. Marine Shale has complied
with some DEQ orders and has appealed others, including one revoking
its permits because it allegedly treated waste from a foreign
country, Canada, in violation of state law.
   Company vice president and general counsel George Eldredge has
repeatedly accused DEQ of delaying administrative hearings on
orders, some dating to 1986. Kent is eager to get DEQ hearings over
with so he can take matters to court. Miriam Price of St. Mary
Parish is just as eager as Kent, but for different reasons. ``I see
a long road ahead for those of us who would like to see Marine Shale
closed. And we're looking to DEQ to do the job.''
   Mrs. Price claims a personal stake. Her granddaughter, Nicole
Price, is one of six children afflicted with a rare form of cancer,
malignant neuroblastoma.
   The mother of one child who died from the disease has filed suit
against Marine Shale, blaming it for the cancer. Mrs. Price points
out that all six were diagnosed after the company began operations.
   Nonetheless, she said, ``I cannot accuse them _ I have no proof.''
   A Louisiana State University study of the neuroblastoma cases
notes that the cancer is usually thought to originate before birth
and that three of the stricken children were born before Marine
Shale began operating.
   In almost four years of study, the Environmental Protection
Agency has yet to say whether Marine Shale has done anything wrong
or if it should be allowed to keep operating. ``We really can't make
additional comments on Marine Shale, because of the legal
complexities of the case,'' said spokesman Roger Meacham.
   More than a year ago, the EPA did say Marine Shale's aggregate
posed no ``imminent or substantial endangerment to the public health
or environment.''
   The state halted sales because of evidence that rain, especially
acid rain, could cause lead and other metals to dissolve out of the
material in higher amounts than the EPA allows, said DEQ attorney
Elizabeth Megginson.
   Megginson cited tests revealing lead levels of .55 parts per
million to 1.5 ppm vs. an EPA standard of .5 ppm. Eldredge, however,
said standards that apply to Marine Shale's product allow up to 5
ppm.
   Kent said he would not immediately fight the DEQ order in court,
but would hold up shipments of the aggregate and try to work out an
agreement with state officials to test the product and ensure its
safety.
   As Marine Shale's appeals drag on, its giant kiln, resembling an
elongated cement mixer, continues to turn and aggregate continues to
tumble out.
   Wastes poured into the kiln are heated to 2,000 degrees for 2{
hours while vapors from the process run through two giant buildings
lined with scores of filters and rise into the air through a
smokestack 140 feet high.
   What's left is a brownish-gray powder. If tests show toxic
materials were eliminated, the process is over; the powder also can
be used in road-building, and has been used to soak up liquid waste.
If toxic metals like lead or barium are found in the powder _ they
don't burn _ it is blown into furnaces, melted and cooled to form
the gem-like chunks Kent calls ``Black Gold.''
   Meanwhile, Marine Shale continues negotiating with DEQ over the
complicated issues surrounding its process. If that fails, Eldredge
said, ``It won't be decided until it gets to the Louisiana Supreme
Court.''

<HEAD>Maybe We Consumers Aren't So Deep In Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<UNK>AP Business Analyst</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have learned to use debt like never
before, but it doesn't necessarily follow that they are creating an
economic problem in doing so.
   That assumption _ that consumer debt is dangerously high _ is
often made after a casual glance at lending figures that, among
other things, show the debt-to-income ratio at sky-high levels
compared to a few years ago.
   A decade ago, for example, analysts worried when the ratio
reached 15.5, meaning that consumer debt was 15.5 percent of
disposable income. When it topped 16 percent a few years later they
warned that a recession was due.
   True to the forecast, the economy fell into the brief recession
of 1980, and then into a much deeper recession that lasted from July
1981 to November 1982. That brought the ratio back under 15.
   Now, and for the past several years, the ratio is back over 15 _
and 16 and 17 and 18, numbers that had never been seen before and
which weren't even foreseen a decade ago.
   Theories abound: Lenders have lowered their standards,
deregulation has made lenders more aggressive in seeking customers,
prices have risen faster than many incomes, and stable employment
has created a sense of security.
   Some critics believe that the sense of security from stable jobs
is a false one. Credit evaluation systems, they point out, rarely
deal explicitly with the question of how long employment might last.
They judge by the past, not future.
   Other observers, however, suggest the explanation is in the
credit figures themselves rather than in consumer behavior. What
seems to be a problem of too much borrowing, they say, may be
statistical rather than economic.
   Here are some numbers to digest:
   _Revolving credit accounts for about 30 percent of consumer
installment credit, rising from $14 billion in 1975 to $185 billion
now, a gain of 1,200 percent.
   _Total installment credit grew from $160 billion in 1975 to $666
billion over the same period.
   _Much of this credit is in the form of money owed to retailers.
But a growing amount of it is in bank credit card balances. In 10
years, the latter have risen from less than 50 percent of revolving
credit to almost two-thirds.
   However, the story told by these figures, provided by economist
William Dunkelberg, is not what it appears to be.
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's School of Business and
Management, calls attention to a fact often overlooked, that more
than half these bank balances _ 25 percent for retail cards _ are
repaid each month at no interest.
   In effect, these balances _ which keep the ratios at record high
levels _ are not ``debt'' in the minds of consumers, but convenient
substitutes for the use of cash and checks in making transactions.
   Dunkelberg estimates, conservatively he says, that $75 billion of
these cash and check substitute balances are not debt in the
traditional sense. Remove them, he says, and the debt-to-income
ratio drops all the way down to 16.5.
   While that percentage is nearly three points lower than the
latest official figures, it still appears high. In fact, it is about
as high as the rate that prevailed just before the 1981-1982
recession.
   Still, Dunkelberg suggests, the ratio might not have the same
significance now as it had back then. Several lending and borrowing
changes tend to put a new and different interpretation on the
figures.
   Important among these changes is a sharp rise in the share of
consumer credit accounted for by consumers in the top 20 percent of
the income tables, many of whom have sufficient assets to support
debt.
   The behavior of these upper-income folks may have changed,
Dunkelberg suggests, because of such things as tax-deductible,
second mortgage lines of credit and the proliferation of credit
cards.
   As he analyzes the scene, the high debt-to-income ratio may not
be evidence of individuals taking on greater risk as much as it is a
sign that more people are using debt, for convenience or other
reasons.

<HEAD>Joanne Woodward Is Host of Homage to Modern Theater Pioneers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joanne Woodward, herself a beneficiary of the
teachings of The Group Theatre, narrates a homage to the handful of
pioneers who changed the face of modern American theater in the
season opener of PBS' ``American Masters'' on Monday.
   Theatergoers take innovation and risk-taking for granted
nowadays. But when Cheryl Crawford, Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman
founded The Group Theatre in 1931, Broadway was awash in polite
drawing-room comedies and stodgy, mainstream drama.
   All three had worked at the Theatre Guild, Crawford as a casting
director, Clurman as a play reader and Strasberg as a stage manager
and sometime actor. But they felt no emotional connection to the
works there. Amid the troubled times following the crash on Wall
Street, they joined together in a common belief that the theater
should be more of an outlet for societal reflection and formed a
repertory company that would produce American plays on Broadway.
   The 90-minute documentary, ``Broadway Dreamers: The Legacy of the
Group Theatre,'' includes Woodward's interviews, over a five-year
period, with as many of the original members and associates as
possible, including Crawford. Also included are archival interviews
with the late Clurman and Strasberg.
   The Group Theatre lasted only a decade, but its impact is still
felt in American theater and film today. The teachers it launched
handed down a then ground-breaking philosophy of craft combined with
creativity. Group members Stella Adler, Strasberg, Sanford Meisner
(Woodward's teacher) and Robert Lewis numbered among their students
Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep,
Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, Gregory Peck, Ellen Burstyn, Shelley
Winters, playwright David Mamet and directors Sydney Pollack and
Peter Bogdanovich.
   Woodward also talks to many actors, playwrights and directors who
began their careers with The Group Theatre. Interspersed with the
interviews is footage from a 1987 Williamstown, Mass., stage tribute
to The Group Theatre. Appearing to perform readings are Woodward,
Newman, Winters, Burstyn and James Naughton, among others.
   Two other actors pay homage to former teachers who were part of
The Group Theatre in subsequent ``American Masters'' programs.
   On July 3, Meryl Streep narrates ``Harold Clurman: A Life of
Theatre.'' The documentary includes never-before-seen footage of
stage performances and interviews with students and associates of
Clurman, including Julie Harris, Arthur Miller, Strasberg, Elia
Kazan, Karl Malden and Roy Scheider, who reads from Clurman's
lectures.
   Then on July 10, Frank Langella narrates ``Stella Adler: Awake
and Dream!'' It includes a lengthy interview with Adler, whose
students included Brando, De Niro, Beatty and Candice Bergen.

   Elsewhere in television:
   CASTING CALL _ Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creator-writer of
``Designing Women,'' is looking for an actress, preferably with a
country-western background and an authentic Southern accent, to play
Hal Holbrook's wife in her new series, ``Arkansas,'' which is
scheduled to premiere as a midseason replacement next season on CBS.
Holbrook will play a judge married to a woman some 20 years younger.
Bloodworth-Thomason said she is looking for a ``name'' actress.
Dolly Parton had sprung to mind, but she wasn't available. ``I want
them (Holbrook character and his wife) to have a really high-voltage
relationship,'' Bloodworth-Thomason said. ``They will already have
five children when the show begins, and I may write it so that the
wife is pregnant again in the first episode.'' Bloodworth-Thomason
says ``Arkansas'' ``will have some of the flavor of `The Andy
Griffith Show,' but with a little more sophistication.''
Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband, producer-director Harry
Thomason, have a home in Little Rock, Ark. Harry Thomason's brother,
Danny, a Little Rock optometrist, will likely have a supporting role
as a bailiff in the new show. He did a guest shot on last season's
``Designing Women,'' which his brother also produces. Speaking of
family ties, Holbrook plays the romantic interest of his real-life
wife, Dixie Carter, on ``Designing Women.'' ...
   O'REILLY GETS `INSIDE EDITION' NOD _ Bill O'Reilly has re-upped
for a new season as anchor of King World's syndicated newsmagazine,
``Inside Edition,'' quashing rumors that King World was courting
Maury Povich, the anchor of the show's competitor, Fox's ``A Current
Affair.'' King World Chairman Michael King said O'Reilly's
``commitment to the show, combined with his intellect and humor adds
the right ingredient that makes `Inside Edition' the successful show
it has become.'' O'Reilly took over the anchor spot earlier this
year from David Frost, who left shortly after the show premiered,
reportedly because station programmers didn't like his gushy style.

<HEAD>Past Is No Burden to Guitarist's Creativity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guitarist Steve Morse can't escape his past, but
he says the devotion fans have to his old band, the Dregs, hasn't
stifled his creativity or kept him from looking to the future.
   Wherever Morse plays these days, people want to hear the old
songs he wrote and performed with the Dregs, an eclectic
instrumental group that never had anything approaching a hit record
but garnered an intensely loyal _ though relatively small _
following.
   The band, originally called the Dixie Dregs, was formed in 1977
and broke up in 1983, leaving behind six albums and memories of
frenzied, stimulating concerts. The continuing interest in the old
material is no problem for the 35-year-old Morse.
   ``What allows me and my family to eat is the fact that people do
come back,'' he said in an interview during a short break from a
month-long club tour to promote his latest solo album, ``High
Tension Wires'' for MCA records.
   ``It's like one guy, a baker, in a neighborhood of a big city
doing his job the best he can. He gets a following and, as long as
he does the job, people will come back.
   ``I'm more like that neighborhood baker than Nabisco, but the
repeat business gives me confidence there will be a tomorrow.''
   Morse's latest music is, like the Dregs, a wide mix of styles. He
incorporates rock, jazz, classical, Celtic and country and fuses
them into a sound that somehow manages to be both manic and sweetly
lyrical.
   There's also a bit more acoustic guitar than before from the
five-time winner of Guitar Player magazine's ``Best Overall''
readers poll category.
   Though Morse is joined by some of his former bandmates on the
album, which contains a remake of the Dregs' ``Leprechaun
Promenade'' recorded during a brief 1988 reunion, his touring trio
includes new sidemen Van Romaine on drums and Dave Larou on bass.
   Morse said he was excited about the new band, which hit the road
after only three days of rehearsal. He likes the freedom of playing
in front of an audience, and relishes the contrast from the more
methodical approach he takes in the studio.
   ``Playing live is the ultimate expression. When you improvise,
it's stream of consciousness,'' he said. ``Playing live is like
driving a race car. You have to react quickly, and hope you're
right.''
   The live show includes songs from the Dregs days, numbers from
his two previous Steve Morse Band albums and about three selections
from the new record.
   The band does not play many of the quieter songs on stage. ``We
try to keep the energy level up,'' Morse said.
   Since the break-up of the Dregs, Morse also has played with the
group Kansas and sat in with the reformed Lynyrd Skynyrd. Those
projects gave him another outlet for his guitar playing _ that of
sideman instead of bandleader.
   ``Part of the reason I did the thing with Kansas was to
completely experience the opposite (of leading a band),'' he said.
``In manageable doses it's fun, it's less pressure. Just playing
guitar parts and showing up for gigs alive _ that's a lot less
pressure.''
   Morse also is an accomplished pilot who flies his group's
airplane from date to date. He also holds clinics for young
guitarists in almost every town in which he performs.
   He said the guitarists coming up now are approaching the
instrument differently than when he started out, but their goals
have not changed.
   ``The emphasis now is more on technique _ and I don't mean
moronic technique _ than on writing,'' he said. ``There's more
emphasis on two-handed playing and on whammy-bar playing.
   ``But I guess the motivating factor is the same as 10, 20 years
ago. The kids want to play and make good music come out of their
guitars.''
   Morse also sees a resurgence in interest in instrumental rock
music, and he finds that gratifying.
   ``But it would make me feel better if it had happened when we
were doing it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Will an economically integrated Europe, scheduled
for 1992, cooperate in world trade for the benefit of everyone or
fight to maintain a privileged position for itself?
   On either side of the Atlantic the almost automatic answer varies
little: Why of course Europe will pursue an open trade policy.
Doesn't everyone know that free trade _ trade without artificial
barriers _ benefits everyone?
   The automatic response and the eagerness to assure, however, may
be only a veneer covering vast uncertainties. An economically
unified Europe could be an amiable giant or, if provoked, a muscled
bully protecting his turf.
   In the abstract, every important trading nation professes an
almost theological belief in free trade. But each also is aware of
the benefits, however temporary, of limiting the flow of foreign
goods into its markets.
   Which course will Europe take?
   By the end of 1992, members of the European Economic Community
plan to remove almost all barriers to each other's trade, investment
and movement of labor, creating a common market of 320 million
people.
   Obviously, they wouldn't do so if they didn't believe in mutual
benefits for each other. Instead of a dozen relatively weak markets
for goods, the united market would be an economic entity comparable
to the United States.
   Having achieved that, will they then seek to protect their
``free'' market from others? Will they restrict Japanese and
American access, or will they express their faith in open
competition by leaving their market doors ajar?
   While the latter seems the most likely route, the underlying
uncertainty is aroused again and again by incidents that, isolated
from the bigger picture, seem of far less importance.
   This week in Geneva, for example, some European trade negotiators
felt the United States had violated the spirit of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by threatening trade sanctions
against Brazil, India and Japan.
   Those sanctions have not been imposed, and there is some question
about whether Uncle Sam really intends to do anything at all about
what he perceives to be unfair trade practices by these nations.
   The mere threat, however, was sufficient to raise tempers _ and
in trade talks, whenever tempers rise the threat of retaliation soon
follows.
   A simple French television commercial, now two years old but
still replayed in the minds of wary Americans and Japanese, also
demonstrates how close those uncertainties are to the surface.
   The commercial, sponsored by the French government, showed a
skinny boxer faced down by a huge American football player and a
massive and menacing Japanese sumo wrester.
   The fate of the skinny French boxer seemed bleak, but he did not
run. No need to, because soon he was surrounded by 11 other boxers
who helped rout the huge American football player and the massive
Japanese wrestler.
   In short, scratch a free-trader on either side of the Atlantic or
anywhere else in the world and you might find a protectionist.
   The latter might bury their sympathies for the sake of public
decorum, but seldom do they bury them so deep that they cannot be
aroused and resurrected immediately.

<HEAD>Sexual Harassment Troubles Churches As Women Clergy Increase</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shocked at its extent, churches are grappling
with a newly recognized problem in their own domain _ sexual
harassment of women, particularly female clergy.
   Concern about it has risen as increasing numbers of women have
entered the ordained ministry, traditionally a profession of males
and largely limited to them until modern times.
   The trouble, however, has surfaced among lay women as well as
clergywomen.
   It has turned up in ``every setting of the church,'' declared the
board of directors of the United Church of Christ's Coordinating
Center for Women in Church and Society, after reviewing reports
about it.
   One of the center's research projects found that of 138 women
clergy surveyed, 45 percent of them said they had been sexually
harassed in the workplace, that is, in church precincts.
   ``It's a startling figure,'' said Marilyn Breitling of St. Louis,
the center's executive director. ``The harassment was not identified
by type, but no matter how you define it, that's an inordinately
high number.
   ``We were shocked.''
   However, there has been little or no awareness of the problem
until recently, she said, but it now is drawing increased attention
in major Protestant denominations, most of which now ordain women.
   ``It was very, very hidden and people did not talk about it, but
now they're beginning to talk about it in a straightforward way, and
seek ways to deal with it,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Especially in church, ``you expect to be treated with respect and
dignity,'' she said. For church colleagues ``to intimidate, take
advantage, harass or molest is just unconscionable.
   ``Unfortunately, those kind of things are happening. Harassment
is occuring even in the church. The church needs to speak to that
problem in its own life, just as it speaks to things in the culture
at large.''
   Among lay women, the center's survey found 20 percent of them
reported incidents of sexual harassment within the church, less than
half the proportion of women clergy doing so.
   The 1.7-million-member United Church through its antecedant
Congregationalism (merged in 1957 with the Evangelical and Reformed
Church) pioneered women's ordination, beginning in the l850's.
   Sixteen percent of the denomination's 10,000 clergy are women.
   Other Protestant bodies, including Presbyterians, Lutherans,
United Methodists, Episcopalians and others, have begun ordaining
women only since the 1950's. More than 20,000 women now are among
U.S. clergy.
   Sexual harassment has aroused concern in several denominations.
The Presbyterian Church (USA) last week called for development of a
church-wide policy on sexual misbehavior in the church household.
   In most denominations, ``all of us are very much concerned about
the issue,'' said Ann Dubois, a Louisville, Ky., Presbyterian
specialist on women in church employment.
   A special study about it is under way in the Northeast.
   ``It's no respecter of denominations,'' Mrs. Breitling said.
``It's a very common experience. It's also one we've avoided dealing
with. But the issue is coming to the fore in most every
denomination.''
   The United Methodist Church at its l986 governing conference said
sexual harassment has been documented in congregations, agencies,
seminaries and other institutions. One limited survey found one in
eight United Methodist women reported being sexually harassed in
church environs.
   The denomination called for grievance procedures for victims and
penalties for offenders. It also launched a denomination-wide study
on the extent of church sexual harassment.
   The United Church's women's center proposes a resolution for the
denomination's General Synod June 29-July 4, saying women
volunteers, seminarians, pastors and lay employees report ``varied
experiences of sexual harassment.''
   That is a ``disappointing fact in an institution that is based on
values of equality and respect for all persons,'' the measure says.
It calls for gathering of more data and developing guidelines about
the matter.
   The resolution identifies two types of sexual harassment, one
being the ``imposition of unwelcome sexual activity, suggestion or
behavior in a relationship of unequal power.''
   That refers to such situations as between pastor and associate
minister or intern, or between clergywomen and members of the church
board of trustees when superiors manipulate women into demoralizing
affairs.
   A second type of harassment cited is the creation of a ``hostile,
intimidating atmosphere in the workplace'' that offends or disturbs
women personnel, even if there is ``no direct damage to victims.''
   ``Even if it's seemingly harmless inuendo, it can be offensive
and create an unpleasant work situation,'' Ms. Breitling said.
``There are a lot of variations and complex relationship questions.''
   While open, friendly hugs or pats between mutually respecting
associates are not considered in the harassment category, she said
objectionable activity generally is distinguishable by victims.
   As one woman put it, ``I've been hugged, and I've been `groped'
and I know the difference.''

   Eastern Orthodoxy's objections to ordaining
women and a British clergywoman's reactions produced a strained
moment here at the recent interdenominational World Conference on
Mission and Evangelism.
   On behalf of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox participants, Bishop
Antonius Markos of Egypt said they supported a study by the World
Council of Churches of full participation of women in church life,
but not in the priesthood.
   To admit women to the priesthood is ``not, for us, subject to
debate, since it is contrary to Christology, ecclesiology, tradition
and practices'' of the church through the ages.
   Later, in discussing a proposal expressing joy at growing unity
among Christians, the Rev. Elizabeth Jane Nash of the United
Reformed Church in Great Britain said she was ``deeply hurt'' by the
Orthodox statement and added:
   ``How can I as a woman, an ordained woman ... express joy when I
experience rejection and hurt?''
   Markos replied that the Orthodox did not intend to hurt anybody
but ``in love, we have to express our faith.'' He added: ``Any woman
ordained by her own church, if her church accepts her, we will give
her all respect.''

<TEXT>
   When it comes to Shakespeare, ``Hamlet'' is still
very much the thing.
   In recent months, Britain's two large government-subsidized
theaters have tackled the Prince of Denmark, and two other London
plays are now on using Hamlet as a central character.
   It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and Hamlet's
celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese (``si
hai shi huo''), Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'') or English
(``To be or not to be'').
   In Paris, Patrice Chereau's production recently swept the Moliere
Awards, the French equivalent of Broadway's Tony. Britain has
averaged eight major ``Hamlet'' productions every year for the past
three years. New York's Public Theater presented it in 1986 with
Kevin Kline as the prince.
   Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress
Sarah Bernhardt a century ago, Dame Judith Andersonand more recently
Diane Venora at the Public in 1982.
   Laurence Olivier called it ``the best play ever written,'' and
his 1948 film portrayal was the only Shakespeare work ever to win
Academy Awards for best film and best actor.
   Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great
18th-century actor David Garrick hated the graveyard scene. ``I
swore,'' he said, ``that I would not leave the stage 'till I had
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.''
   The Victorians left out Hamlet's lapses into vernacular, along
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect
prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot
involving the agents and friends of Hamlet's Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole,
much-applauded play by British dramatist Tom Stoppard about two
characters who find they do not exist outside the play.
   In 1987, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed production
with his Royal Dramatic Theater of Stockholm had a week-long run in
Britain, and in September Russian director Yuri Lyubimov will stage
``Hamlet'' with a British company at the Leicester Haymarket Theater.
   Drawn from Scandinavian legend, ``Hamlet'' is about a prince who
comes home from university to discover that his father has been
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the
queen he has widowed.
   Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of Denmark, Hamlet
plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched
poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by
dying in a sword fight.
   At its most basic, Hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be
reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over
the ages have seen Hamlet as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist,
militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of
action.
   This troubles some actors including Jonathan Pryce, who derides
what he calls the ``Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the
play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to
everything and everyone, ``Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in
particular.
   ``Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks
Lynne Truss in The Listener magazine. ``The answer seems to be that,
on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any
interpretation seems to be valid.''
   In recent years Londoners have been treated to Roger Rees' dry,
intensely cerebral Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company; Peter
Stormare's manic, military Hamlet for Ingmar Bergman; and now Daniel
Day-Lewis' highly emotional and impetuous Hamlet at the National.
   Richard Eyre's production continues the National's tradition of
doing a ``Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's
tenure. Day-Lewis, best known for the films ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``A Room With
a View,'' has inherited a part played in 1963 by Peter O'Toole and
in 1976 by Albert Finney.
   Also on show are Iris Murdoch's ``The Black Prince,'' adapted
from her 1973 novel, and the revival of Anton Chekhov's 1887
``Ivanov,'' with Alan Bates as a penniless landowner who sees
himself as a failed Hamlet figure.
   Murdoch, 69, first encountered Hamlet as a school text when she
was 15. She ``an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of
Bradley Pearson, the sardonic tax inspector of ``The Black Prince''
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of Hamlet.
   ``I became absolutely entranced by it and by Shakespeare
generally,'' she recalled in an interview. ``He's very good on
politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.''
   From Garrick and Henry Irving through John Barrymore, Olivier and
John Gielgud to today's acting generation, Hamlet remains the hurdle
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And
they rarely agree on whether Hamlet is an easy role or a difficult
one.
   ``It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which
adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues Michael
Pennington, who played the role in 1980 at Stratford.
   But Mark Rylance, who plays ``Hamlet'' in the Royal Shakespeare
Company's current Stratford production, disagrees.
   ``I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role,
it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. ``The
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot
of people cop out of that.''
   Eyre, 46, first directed ``Hamlet'' in an acclaimed London
production in 1980, then returned to the play intrigued by its
elasticity.
   ``I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing
up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over
the novel and films, too,'' he said.
   ``It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with,
a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off,
Hamlet is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince.
   ``This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of
Realpolitik.''

   In Act III, scene 1 of Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,''
the tormented prince contemplates life and death. Brooding over his
uncle's usurpation of the throne and hasty marriage with his widowed
mother, he ponders whether or not he should kill the usurper _ or
himself.
   Hamlet reveals his thoughts to the audience, but not to the other
characters, in what is regarded as one of the most important
passages in drama.
   Just about every school child has at one point or another
memorized Hamlet's soliloquy, and actors throughout the world
explore its meaning in almost every language, including Chinese
(``si hai shi huo'') and Swedish (``Att vara eller icke vara'').

<HEAD>A Bangladesh Success Story: The Garment Industry ^LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quiet revolution is taking root behind
the soft whir of sewing machines where Bangladeshi women are finding
alternatives to poverty, early marriage and frequent childbirth.
   In this underfed, overpopulated, disaster-prone nation, the
garment industry has established itself as a success story both
economically and socially.
   Nahar was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a
bicycle-rickshaw puller who, she said, beat her. By the age of 16,
she was a deserted wife with an infant son.
   Traditionally, the only respectable options for a poor village
girl like Nahar would have been remarriage or becoming a maid. The
other possibilities in Bangladesh's limited female labor market were
husking rice, pounding bricks and stones into gravel at construction
sites, or prostitution.
   Instead, a few months after Nahar's husband cast her out in 1985,
a relative offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry.
   Today, at the age of 20, she is a sewing machine operator at Y.K.
Garments on Elephant Road in the center of Dhaka and sends half her
monthly salary of 900 takas (about $28) home to her mother in the
village to take care of her 5-year-old son. Her annual salary of
$336 is more than double the country's per capita annual income of
$160.
   ``I feel I'm the happiest woman on earth,'' she said. ``No one
beats me anymore almost every night. I'm independent and I earn my
own money.''
   Like many Bangladeshis, she goes only by her first name, Nahar,
and does not use her last.
   Such independence is still rare for most Bangladeshi women, but
it is a beginning and it is growing.
   About 300,000 women work in Bangladesh's clothing factories,
making up 90 percent of the industry's work force. The number of
export-oriented clothing factories swelled from four in 1979 to 722
in 1988, according to government statistics.
   Export earnings shot up from $500,000 in 1979 to $450 million in
1988 and now bring in 35 percent of the nation's foreign exchange.
   Today Bangladesh is the fifth-largest exporter of ready-made
clothing to the United States, after Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan
and China, according to the U.S. Embassy.
   But the garment industry could help in another problem area _
population growth _ if more women choose to work and marry later,
thereby reducing their child-bearing years.
   Bangladesh is the world's most densely populated land after the
city-states of Hong Kong and Singapore. If its birth rate is not
checked, its population of 110 million will double within 35 years.
According to UNICEF, 86 percent of the population already lives
below the poverty level.
   Ayesha Khatoon, daughter of a landless peasant in Bangladesh's
northern Rangpur district, was 11 when she fled to Dhaka in 1984
because her parents planned to marry her off to a 16-year-old boy.
   ``I did not want the marriage,'' she said. ``The job at the
garment factory has saved my life. Otherwise I would have ended up
either being a maid at a rich man's house or, who knows, in a
brothel.''
   Ayesha and three of her co-workers at Meghna Garments Industry
Ltd. share a one-room, tin-roofed apartment. That in itself is a
social breakthrough in a country where single women are expected to
live with their families.
   One of her roommates, 25-year-old Khodeza, said she left her
husband two years ago because he insisted they have a fifth child.
The first four were girls, and he wanted a son.
   ``One night I thought and thought. Suddenly I decided that I
can't take it anymore. I must leave for a life of my own,'' Khodeza
said.
   ``The garment women have achieved a great social revolution in
our conservative Moslem society,'' said Sufia Kamal, a women's
rights activist and leading poet. ``They have done what many of us
educated women have failed to achieve so far. Although the women are
taking the jobs out of necessity, they are also silently fighting
against the social taboos.''

   Eastern Orthodoxy's objections to ordaining
women and a British clergywoman's reactions produced a strained
moment here at the recent interdenominational World Conference on
Mission and Evangelism.
   On behalf of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox participants, Bishop
Antonius Markos of Egypt said they supported a study by the World
Council of Churches of full participation of women in church life,
but not in the priesthood.
   To admit women to the priesthood is ``not, for us, subject to
debate, since it is contrary to Christology, ecclesiology, tradition
and practices'' of the church through the ages.
   Later, in discussing a proposal expressing joy at growing unity
among Christians, the Rev. Elizabeth Jane Nash of the United
Reformed Church in Great Britain said she was ``deeply hurt'' by the
Orthodox statement and added:
   ``How can I as a woman, an ordained woman ... express joy when I
experience rejection and hurt?''
   Markos replied that the Orthodox did not intend to hurt anybody
but ``in love, we have to express our faith.'' He added: ``Any woman
ordained by her own church, if her church accepts her, we will give
her all respect.''

   David Maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his
country. His country, until now, has disagreed.
   The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the
shoulder seven years after Maier's discharge from the Navy.
   But the Vietnam veteran, now 46 and living in Bay Village, Ohio,
puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide
U.S. troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast Asia. He is
convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored Mekong River water
pumped aboard his ship for showers.
   Like more than 34,000 other Vietnam veterans who believe they
have become ill because of Agent Orange, Maier applied for
government disability benefits. And like all but five of those
applicants, he was denied.
   Now Maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a
federal judge's ruling in San Francisco last month that found the
government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the
doubt.
   To the surprise of many veterans, the Bush administration decided
not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary Edward Derwinski
announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for
the Veterans Administration, would rewrite its rules for granting
disability.
   Derwinski's decision could open the door to claims from hundreds
of thousands of Vietnam veterans.
   Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent
Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never
applied because they believed they didn't stand a chance of getting
disability.
   Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously
optimistic that the VA has changed its attitude along with its name.
   ``It is our feeling at this point that Secretary Derwinski really
does want to see some change,'' said Barry Kasinitz, a spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, the group that brought the lawsuit in
San Francisco.
   Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep
bitterness that many Vietnam veterans feel toward a government that
they believe used and abandoned them.
   ``We'll believe it when we see it,'' said James Sparrow, the
executive director of Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Victims, an
advocacy group based in Stamford, Conn.
   ``It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they
can,'' said Sandra Hosty, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a
San Francisco group that provides counseling and representation for
veterans seeking benefits.
   Still, Ms. Hosty added, ``I would love to be surprised. I would
love to be wrong.''
   Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was
stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a
50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
   In Vietnam, U.S. troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to
strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked
devastatingly well.
   The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is
present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance
ever tested on laboratory animals.
   Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the
herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT.
   The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe
skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that
they got the rash from Agent Orange, a burden that has been
impossible for most to meet.
   However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of
responsibility, the VA has provided free medical care to anyone who
believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange.
   Under Derwinski's new orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits,
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a
``significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange
and a disease.
   A scientific advisory committee is to review the proposed changes
at a June 26 meeting, after which they will be published in the
Federal Register. Derwinski will make a final decision on the
changes, probably in October.
   Once new guidelines are in place, the VA's advisory committee
will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and
diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final
decision will be up to Derwinski.
   The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest.
After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical
companies settled out of court for $180 million in 1984.
   Derwinski has said cost is irrelevant to the VA's stance.
Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or
Social Security, currently range from $73 a month for a veteran who
is 10 percent disabled to $1,468 a month for a veteran who is 100
percent disabled.
   If just 30,000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled, the
cost to the government would be more than $26 million a year.
   For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt
the VA will adopt sweeping changes.
   ``The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of
thousands of claims,'' said Sparrow. ``I just don't see how they
could do it.''
   Fred Juarbe, director of the National Veterans Service program
for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, commended Derwinski for taking ``a
step in the right direction.''
   Still, Juarbe said, ``I think the bottom line is, we're still
going to require legislation. ... Given the way the VA has ruled in
the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the Department of
Veterans Affairs to carry out this policy.''
   One such piece of legislation was introduced in Congress earlier
this month. A bill by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., would provide disability benefits
for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma,
two of the diseases associated with Agent Orange.
   ``It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most
connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to
begin helping Vietnam veterans,'' said Kerry, a former Navy
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the Mekong Delta.
   George Claxton, a former Army sergeant who was, along with Maier,
one of the original plaintiffs in the San Francisco lawsuit against
the VA, said he is optimistic about prospects for change.
   ``I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated
with justice and compassion,'' said Claxton, 46, of Lansing, Mich.,
who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis
and a nervous disorder.
   However, he added: ``Personally, I don't ever expect to be paid
back for what Agent Orange did to me. You pay a heavy price for
war.''

<HEAD>Actress Breaks Male Barrier in Turkey by Becoming a Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leading actress has broken one barrier
for women on Turkey's male-dominated political stage by getting
elected mayor of Sisli, a borough of Istanbul where fancy
residential and shopping areas are ringed by slums.
   Fatma Girik, 46, believes in personal contact her 550,000-member
constituency and in daily personal inspection of public works rather
than relying on reports of her staff.
   Women make better mayors, she recently told a Turkish newspaper.
   ``I see Sisli as my own home and I can communicate much better
with women who deal with day-to-day problems,'' she was quoted as
saying.
   Once a month she opens up city hall to constituents who have
problems.
   White-bearded men clutching worry beads, young mothers carrying
wailing babies, widows without pensions _ people from the underclass
_ come to share their problems with Miss Girik.
   At one recent meeting a young woman, just graduated from high
school, said she was looking for a job.
   ``Don't we have anything, at the switchboard or someplace?'' Miss
Girik asked her staff.
   Not at the moment, she was told. That angered her.
   ``Why did she go to school if she cannot even earn a living? Do
something,'' she ordered the staff.
   ``Grandad,'' she pleaded with another supplicant, ``don't keep
coming here everyday. I promise you your water will be connected
soon.''
   Political experts say it is too early to tell whether Miss
Girik's way of doing things _ putting pressure on bureaucracy and
stretching rules in favor of common people _ will succeed in
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with an overall population of 7
million.
   She won the mayoralty in March when her Social Democrat Populist
Party swept Turkey's urban centers.
   During the campaign the ruling Motherland Party candidates
attacked her as unsuitable on grounds that she lacked experience and
because of her 25-year-old common-law marriage to film director
Memduh Un.
   ``I am running for mayor of Sisli, not for the imam of the Sisli
mosque,'' she shot back at opponents, referring to the Moslem
religious leader.
   Born in Istanbul to a middle-class family in which the father was
a seaman, she quit school after the eighth grade and a few years
later made her way into the movie world in Istanbul's Yesilcam
district, mainly on the strength of her looks.
   She turned out to be a good actress, ``a natural born one,'' says
movie critic Erman Sener.
   She has made 300 movies since starting her film career in 1958
and many are pot-boilers typical of the Turkish movie industry. But,
in the past two decades she has specialized in the portrayal of
Anatolian peasant women. Heroines played by Miss Girik fight for
their rights and their families against difficult odds and often
prevail.
   Attempting to overcome Turkey's social and economic problems may
be more difficult in real life.
   ``I have no time for books, for movies anymore.,'' she said. ``I
am on my feet all day long and hit the bed exhausted.''

   The chairman of the Democratic National
Committee has invited the chairman of the Republican National
Committee to negotiate a truce on negative campaigning.
   Nobody should hold their breath waiting.
   Each side is too busy calling the other names for there to be
real bargaining about campaign standards.
   Democrat Ronald H. Brown said he wants to talk about it.
Republican Lee Atwater says maybe, if the Democrats will deal on
some other topics, too.
   Atwater said the Democrats should approve campaign reforms
President Bush is proposing, and also should make a fair play
agreement on congressional redistricting that will follow the 1990
census. He has said the Republicans were ``ruthlessly
gerrymandered'' by Democrats in the last reapportionment and can't
let it happen again.
   Brown wants a good behavior meeting before anything else is put
on the table. The national parties have agreed on campaign standards
before. And Brown says he is willing to take up other topics,
including reapportionment, in separate meetings later.
   But this feud is likely to go on, between two strong, active
first-year national party chairmen.
   Atwater's tough guy tactics have just received a vote of
confidence plus from his natioal committee members. Some seemed to
want him tougher. The committee adopted a resolution commending
Atwater for the aggressive tactics it said have made him ``the
target of unremitting attacks'' by Democrats.
   President Bush, the boss who counts, repudiated a national
committee slur against House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, but absolved
Atwater.
   Brown insists that Bush himself should be held responsible for
Republican excesses, and says Atwater should resign or be fired. He
thinks GOP tactics and perhaps Atwater personally will become issues
among voters, working to Democratic advantage.
   But the signs so far point the other way.
   Whatever resentment there may be, it isn't rubbing off on Bush.
His job approval rating is up to 73 percent in a Washington Post-ABC
News June poll, matching Ronald Reagan's top rating. Atwater is
willing and happy to serve as a political target, diverting fire
away from the White House, despite the demands of Brown and other
Democrats that Bush be held accountable.
   So far, to the frustration of the Democrats, the two-track GOP
course is succeeding. Brown said the president can't take the
bipartisan high road while others ``do the dirty work'' of political
infighting.
   But that is what's happening.
   The flash point in all of this was a Republican National
Committee memo comparing Foley's voting record with that of Rep.
Barney Frank, who is gay. The GOP memo said Foley had come out of
the liberal closet. Bush said it was disgusting, Atwater apologized,
and a committee publicist resigned.
   Foley is willing to let it go at that. He says that Republicans
who want a return to the war path of ``abusive politics'' are not a
majority, and should not be an obstacle to bipartisanship.
   ``... The most partisan aspects of any party are probably its
national committee, in this case the Republican National
Committee,'' he said on NBC's Meet the Press. ``The president of the
United States is the leader of the Republican Party. He's spoken out
time and time again in support of a bipartisan effort. He's wanting,
actually working, to get that kind of bipartisanship in the
Congress, and we're reciprocating.''
   Brown, meanwhile, was contending that Bush's political troops
``are out of control.'' He said Atwater has ``taken politics to the
lowest level of my lifetime.''
   ``Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is
looking more and more like the coastline of Valdez, Alaska,'' Brown
said. ``Make no mistake, they want the political oil spill of
negative campaigning to spread across America.''
   The Democratic chairman demanded that Bush step out front and
take the Republican political lead.
   Not likely. That's Atwater's assignment.

   Back when television was in diapers, Milton Berle
was in a dress. It was a kinder world then; despite his wardrobe, he
became known as ``Mr. Television.''
   Forty-one years after the debut of ``Texaco Star Theater,'' Berle
wears suits for his rare TV appearances. He smokes big cigars _
Cuban jobs the size of cucumbers. And he has a million memories and
monologues gleaned from a career stretching from vaudeville to video.
   Berle didn't anticipate such success when he moved from the
movies (remember ``Sun Valley Serenade''?) to the small screen on
June 8, 1948.
   ``The power? Nobody knew the power of television. I didn't. I
swear I didn't,'' said the man known to millions as Uncle Miltie
when he was television's undisputed king, holding millions of
Americans hostage in their living rooms each Tuesday night.
   ``The Texaco show of 40 years ago, there were no laugh machines.
If the joke bombed, you died,'' recalled Berle, in town to pitch
``Milton Berle: The Second Time Around,'' a three-tape video
collection of ``Texaco'' clips.
   ``That's why I used to say, `Leave a 9 o'clock wakeup call for
the audience.' Or, `Here's another one you may not care for.' But
that's all gone. Unfortunate.''
   While Berle was television's first major star _ Time called him
``a strange new phenomenon'' _ modesty (and the chance for a cheap
joke) prevents him from claiming he was the one behind its creation.
   ``I didn't start it all,'' Berle said in an interview.
   Pause. Remove cigar. Punchline.
   ``It had to be invented first.''
   Da-dum-dum.
   Uncle Miltie at 80 may wear thick pancake makeup and pitch
underwear on television, but he still has a keen mind and an
incredible recall of names, dates and places.
   An hour-long chat with Berle includes tales of his days and
nights in the Havana Madrid (``51st between Seventh and Broadway''),
Dave's Blue Room (``right on 52nd Street'') and The 500 Club (``in
Atlantic City _ owned by a guy named D'Amato'').
   And he can drop some names: Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Jerry
Lewis, Danny Thomas, Walter Huston, Tallulah Bankhead, Basil
Rathbone. Berle's worked with them all; he also remembers working
with a guy named Dino Crosetti from Steubenville, Ohio.
   ``I said, `Dino's a good name, but there's got to be an easier
name. Something like Dean Kramer or Dean Morton or Dean Martin,'''
said Berle. ``That's how he got the name.''
   Martin and Lewis were later guests on ``Texaco Star Theater,''
which dominated all competition in the late 1940s and early '50s. An
estimated 90 percent of America's sets were tuned to Uncle Miltie
when he was on.
   Berle began his career at age 5, starting out in a silent movie
dubbed ``Tillie's Punctured Romance.'' Even then, he worked with the
big names; the film starred Charlie Chaplin.
   By age 12, Berle was on Broadway. He appeared in more than 50
silent films. He did vaudeville, he played the Catskills. And then,
after 35 years in the business, Berle went video.
   He later went on to other variety shows, appearing on ``The Kraft
Music Hall'' in the late '50s and serving as host for ``The Milton
Berle Show'' in the '60s. He never gave up live performing; after
years of playing in Las Vegas, he now plays twice a year in Atlantic
City and Lake Tahoe.
   Last year, he starred with fellow veterans Danny Thomas and Sid
Caesar in a made-for-television flick called ``Side by Side.'' His
current TV spots are as a pitchman for underwear in which he
confesses, ``At my age, I've done just about everything in my BVDs.''
   He's also written a couple of books: a self-titled 1974
autobiography and ``B.S. I Love You,'' a collection of jokes and
gags picked up during his long association with the Friars Club.
   ``I get interviews where people say, `Milton, that's a helluva
risk you took.' I said, `It was, but it wasn't. Not with the acts I
had.' I used to book the best acts available,'' Berle recalled.
``And I told 'em, `Don't worry about the cameras. They'll catch
you.'''
   Today, Berle doesn't watch much TV: ``Debates, sports, `20-20'
and `60 Minutes.' And O'Neil _ what's that? _ `McNeil-Lehrer.' So I
don't watch.''
   But with television marking its 50th anniversary, Berle's role in
the medium has again been spolighted. Along with his dress-wearing
antics, the Berle legacy includes a reputation as a joke-snatcher _
``The Thief of Bad Gags,'' the great columnist Walter Winchell once
called him. Berle maintains he started this himself as a publicity
scam.
   And the dresses?
   ``Too long a story on that,'' said Berle, glancing quickly at two
female publicists in the room. ``I'll tell you alone.''
   Berle is winding down when he's asked about the first night of
``Texaco'' _ who was on the show? He pauses, removes his well-chewed
stogie and looks straight ahead, going back 41 years in 15 seconds.
   ``June 8, 1948,'' said Uncle Miltie, pausing again. ``Sophie
Tucker. And a dance team, they were wonderful. Don't know if you
ever saw them: the Zoneys. A brother-sister team. Didn't speak to
each other; fought like cats and dogs. A great harmonica artist,
Stan Fisher. And (bandleader _ `Is Everybody Happy?') Ted Lewis.''
   Berle remembers all the guests; he also remembers the immediate,
overwhelming reaction his show produced.
   ``The next day I walked out of my house on 88th Street, took a
cab to the Friars for lunch. I decided to walk the last few blocks.
I walked a couple of blocks, and the people were all following me,''
the great entertainer said.
   ``I never knew so many people saw the show that night. It was the
next day. That's how quickly. ... The instantaneous value of that
was very remarkable.
   ``One show.''

   Nearly 13 years ago, the sinister cackle of young
Johnny Rotten kicked off ``Anarchy in the U.K.'' and the brief,
remarkable history of The Sex Pistols.
   ``All we're trying to do is destroy everything,'' the singer
boasted at the time, and the punk band made music that lived up to
his words.
   Such songs as ``Holidays in the Sun,'' ``Pretty Vacant'' and
``God Save the Queen'' were an enraged response to the complacent,
mainstream rock of the mid-1970s and opened the way for The Clash,
Gang of Four and Elvis Costello.
   The Sex Pistols made just one album before breaking up. Rotten
quickly distanced himself from his old band, reverting to his
original name, John Lydon, and forming Public Image Ltd., which had
a danceable sound that drew upon a wide variety of music.
   Public Image Ltd. has been more durable, if less exciting, than
The Sex Pistols, and has just released ``9,'' its ninth album. The
current lineup consists of Lydon, guitarist ish
folk culture. Irish folk music does relate very much to Bulgarian,
which relates to Turkey, which relates to the Arab, all the way
around, going into Morocco, back up through Spain again. Marvelous.''
   The Sex Pistols:
   ``It got very, very stale and I had to call it quits. It was the
Pistols then, it's Public Image now. I always offer an alternative.''
   The film ``Sid and Nancy,'' which depicted the life of Sex
Pistols bassist Sid Vicious:
   ``To be misrepresented so badly was a great disappointment.
(Director) Alex Cox never communicated with any of the Pistols, not
even the manager at that time, none of us. So how on earth can you
present that film as a semi-documentary?
   ``It was like `Fantasy Island' gone wrong. How can you use
someone like Joe Strummer and Iggy Pop as research. What do they
know about the workings of the Pistols? Nothing. You might as well
have asked ... Liberace and probably would have achieved better
results.''
   Performing drunk:
   ``I put that down to inexperience. Not having respect for myself.
Going on stage drunk is a tragedy. I did do that a few times because
I was so bloody nervous. The end result was a shambles.
   ``Apologies, folks, for those bad old days but there weren't too
many of them.''
   Non-violence:
   ``If you want to destroy a government, it's very easy. Just lay
down your tools, all at once. The country will collapse overnight.
   ``The minute you have to kill people for a cause, you have no
cause. You immediately show you have no respect for human life.
There's no real need for it. We can change this planet, Gandhi
proved that.''
   Failure:
   ``Before every gig, I'm absolutely terrified, completely. I want
every show to be the ultimate. Once I'm on, then I'm fine, you know,
home run. But that buildup _ bloody dreadful.''
   Music video:
   ``I've had some wonderful fantasies in my life. I envisioned
myself as operating this video company. I realized after three weeks
I loathed video. I cannot stand it. I don't like watching it. These
are Polaroids, they're trivial. I don't like fiddling about with
cameras.''
   Lyrics:
   ``People don't actually listen to the songs they're dancing to.
... I had to listen to every single word used. I just liked
language. It's our major achievement as a species.''
   Songwriting:
   ``On a lot of my songs, I just sit down and write it, line after
line after line. I keep running the ideas through my head and
finally the best way of doing it just occurs to me quite naturally.''
   His Public Image bandmates:
   ``If you can't get on with people, there's no point. I don't care
about looks, I care about personality, some sense of musical
innovation. I'm not interested in some sort of manufactured pop or
set, organized musical things, that bores me.''
   Phil Donahue's hair:
   ``You can't tell me that's not a wig! You can see it on the back
of his head. Most wig manufacturers are pretty sophisticated, but
Phil isn't!''
   Imitators:
   ``Don't imitate me. Don't ever imitate me. That would not be a
form of flattery at all. That would be worse than being in a heavy
metal band.''

<HEAD>Woman Starts National Campaign for Bittering Compound in Poisons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB BAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What Lynn Tylczak wants to put in household
products would make you gag.
   Literally.
   The 33-year-old mother of two has launched a campaign to add the
world's bitterest substance _ the Guinness Book of World Records
says it is _ to garden sprays, antifreeze, window cleaner and other
poisons. The goal is to make them so bitter children will
immediately spit them out.
   ``I figured I should taste it to tell people how bad it is,''
Tylczak said. ``It really made my mouth feel like a place where old
spiders go to die. I went around for weeks spitting. I looked like I
played major league baseball. My mom thought I'd taken up chewing
tobacco.''
   Her crusade began Feb. 6 when she heard on the radio that the
compound known as denatonium benzoate, generally sold under the
trademark Bitrex, is put into poisonous materials in Great Britain.
Bittering compounds also are used in West Germany and are required
by law in antifreeze in Australia and pesticide in Japan. In the
United States, a few products, such as Bold and Solo liquid
detergents and Sterno fuel, contain it.
   The free-lance writer took her 5-year-old son and 3-month-old
daughter to the Oregon State University library to find out more. It
was three weeks before she found an article on the substance
discovered 30 years ago by McFarlan-Smith Ltd. of Britain and used
generally to denature alcohol.
   ``I tried writing manufacturers and got no good response, and I
got nothing from the politicians,'' she said. ``They sent me form
letters saying `Thank you for the input. Don't forget to vote for me
in the next election.' I thought, `I'm going to have to demonstrate
that people care about this...'
   ``I wrote to about 20 of the big newspapers, then I wrote to
consumer groups, magazines, health magazines, insurance magazines,
the people I thought would pick it up.''
   Tylczak and about 20 Albany-area women formed Project Poison
Proof, which has gotten thousands of letters of support. ``I call it
a leverage blackmail opportunity. I can take pictures of me with the
letters and send them to the manufacturers. Now I'm not just Lynn
Tylczak causing trouble, I'm Lynn Tylczak with the force of X-number
of people causing trouble.''
   The National Safety Council has called on manufacturers to use
Bitrex in all appropriate products. U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., called Tylczak to say he would introduce a bill to require a
bittering compound in all poisonous liquid consumer products.
   ``It is really kicking interest up to a new level,'' said
Mitchell Tracy of Henley Chemicals Inc. in Montvale, N.J., the U.S.
distributor of Bitrex.
   Tylczak said the bittering compound would cost less than a
half-cent per pint and would augment the use of child-proof
containers. Sixty-five percent of child-proof containers sent to the
American Association of Poison Control Centers failed to withstand
children's attempts to open them, she said.
   But most manufacturers don't want to draw attention to the
dangerousness of their products, and say there's no demand for the
bittering agent, she said.
   Bitrex has been used in Solo since 1981 and in Bold since 1985
because for some unknown reason children seem more susceptible to
drnking those products, said Procter &amp; Gamble Inc. spokeswoman
Jennifer Bailey.
   It isn't used in other products because there has been no serious
problem, Bailey said. ``Our safety record with our detergents is
pristine.''
   If consumer demand is strong enough, Procter &amp; Gamble will study
the matter further, she said. ``On the other hand, we don't want
people to let down their guard about proper storage and usage of
these products just because we put a Bitrex-safe concept across the
front of them.''
   Detergents include substances that make people who swallow them
vomit, she said, adding that such household goods aren't as big a
danger as poisons such as antifreeze and herbicides.
   Chevron Corp., which manufactures the Ortho line of herbicides
and pesticides, does not use the bittering agent. ``The primary
reason that we didn't end up using it is that all of our lawn and
garden products are already in child-resistant containers,'' said
spokeswoman Sherri Zippay.
   The company considered using Bitrex in snail and slug bait to
protect pets, Zippay said. ``But snails wouldn't eat it then,
either.''
   Tylczak doesn't want this to be a personal crusade. She's
uncomfortable, with the individual attention she's been getting.
   ``I didn't do anything any other mother wouldn't have done. I was
just the first person that saw it. It takes one spark to start a
forest fire. I was just the spark. Once the fire started, it doesn't
matter who got the thing going.''
   Each year, ``I take up one cause because every year there's at
least one thing that aggravates me and I follow it through until
it's taken care of. Last year, it was property taxes. The tax judge
did agree with me, finally.''
   Still, Tylczak doesn't accept the title of consumer activist.
   ``I'm just an angry mother.''

<HEAD>Spider Silk Studied as Source of Strong Fibers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In research that could provide new materials for
high-strength cables, bulletproof vests and sutures, scientists have
turned to one of the most delicate-looking fibers in nature: silk
spun by spiders.
   Researchers want to learn more about the gossamer threads because
they offer an apparently unique combination of great stretchability
and strength.
   Some day, scientists hope, spider genes will be customized to
produce silks with characteristics most needed for various uses,
maybe even clothing.
   Spiders themselves customize their silk. A spider may produce
half a dozen kinds for a variety of jobs, each silk coming from a
different gland. Several kinds are used in webs. Another, called
dragline silk, is what spiders use to dangle from the ceiling. Still
another is used to make a cocoon for eggs.
   In contrast, silkworms spin only one kind of silk, said David
Kaplan of the U.S. Army Natick Research, Development and Engineering
Center in Natick, Mass.
   Some spider silk is nearly as strong as Kevlar, a synthetic fiber
used in bulletproof vests, said Randy Lewis, head of the molecular
biology department at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. To snap
a dangling 12-inch piece of dragline silk, for example, it is
estimated that one would have to hang another piece of silk from it
approximately 10,000 miles long.
   Much of the work so far has focused on the dragline silk of the
golden orb-weaver. Found in Florida and Central and South America,
the spider is named for its yellowish webs, which can be up to six
feet wide.
   Kaplan, Stephen Lombardi and Wayne Muller have determined the
detailed chemical makeup of the dragline silk, and are using that
information to seek the gene that directs production of the silk.
   Lewis, whose work is supported by the federal Office of Naval
Research, believes he has found the gene. He is now determining its
chemical details.
   Finding a silk gene is important because researchers can then
insert it in bacteria or some other organism that can churn out the
protein that makes up the silk far faster than spiders do. That will
allow further study of the protein, to find out why it is so
stretchable and why it has other properties of interest.
   Knowing the gene should also allow scientists to alter it someday
so that the resulting silk will perform better in particular
applications.
   One possibility is lightweight but strong fiberglass-like
materials, which might be useful for aircraft skin, helmets and
other applications, Kaplan said.
   Another potential use is sutures, Lewis said. Spider silk appears
not to provoke an immune-system reaction from the body, and it
contracts when moist, which could keep stitches snug during the
healing process.
   Still another possibility, if it can be produced cheaply enough,
is clothing. Apart from being as supple as regular silk and more
elastic, spider silk has an ``incredible sheen to it, almost a
metallic sheen'' that suggests mother-of-pearl, Lewis said.

<HEAD>How To Deal With Dental Emergencies During Your Vacation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broken filling, loose crown, or painful,
chipped or fractured tooth sends most people running to their
dentist. But what do you do if you're on vacation without nearby
dental care?
   ``No homemade remedy can ever substitute for the professional
attention of a qualified dentist,'' said dentist Brooks Morgan. ``In
a pinch, though, when you have no alternative, these helpful hints
might come in handy.''
   _For a broken filling, rub the cavity with clove oil. Don't fill
it with candle wax or chewing gum.
   _A bonding compound able to hold a loose crown in place for a day
can be made by mixing petroleum jelly and flour.
   _Take aspirin, acetaminophen or another aspirin substitute for
toothaches. If you have swelling as well as pain, rinse your mouth
regularly with salt water. Apply an ice pack, or even a cold can of
soda. Don't apply aspirin directly to the tooth because it can
permanently damage the nerve.
   _Rinse your mouth with warm water if you chip or break a tooth.
Don't try to file the tooth, and don't use glue to try to save it.
   _Use wet gauze immediately to wrap a tooth that has been knocked
out. Get to a dentist quickly and it might be saved.

<HEAD>Body's Attempt to Fend Off Malaria Apparently Triggers Symptoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anemia, the loss of red blood cells that
can kill people who suffer malaria, is largely caused by the body's
attempt to defend itself against the infectious disease, research on
mice suggests.
   The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory study indicates overstimulation
of part of the immune system also is partly responsible for other
malaria symptoms, like death of kidney tissue, clogging of blood
vessels in the brain, and eventual suppression of the immune system.
   The discovery could lead to better understanding of malaria and a
new treatment against it: use of antibodies against the ``tumor
necrosis factor,'' or TNF, that helps cause the anemia and other
symptoms, researchers said.
   At least 100 million new cases of malaria are reported annually,
and about 1.5 million victims die each year. The disease, which
destroys vital red blood cells, is caused by a parasite called
Plasmodium. The female Anopheles mosquito carries the parasite in
its saliva.
   TNF is produced in the body to hel defend against disease and
promote healing, and is being used as an experimental anti-cancer
therapy. But Paul Silverman, Kathleen Miller and other Lawrence
Berkeley scientists showed that anemia in malaria can be mostly
reversed by giving infected mice an antibody against TNF.
   The study also suggests TNF may play a role in causing chronic
anemia seen in patients with other infectious diseases and certain
cancers, Silverman said.
   Malaria-causing parasites also destroy red blood cells, but
previous studies found that such destruction alone fails to explain
the severity and extent of anemia in malaria patients. Earlier
studies also found that another immune system chemical,
interleukin-1, plays a role in causing anemia in those patients.
   The studies may explain why giving infected mice antibodies
against TNF failed to completely reverse the loss of red blood
cells.

<HEAD>NASA Will Use Jet To Simulate Shuttle Landings On A Flat Tire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA plans to help crews prepare for flat
tires and other problems landing the space shuttle by having an
astronaut fly an armor-plated aircraft to test shuttle landing gear.
   During next year's tests, the Convair CV-990 jet will touch down
on its own landing gear at 225 mph, then lower shuttle landing gear
mounted between its main tires, said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato
at Edwards Air Force Base.
   ``We intend to do a whole series of tests and use different
pressures in the shuttle tire, taking the pressure down to where we
actually destroy the tire,'' Lovato said. Because the Convair's
landing gear will support the plane, there is no danger to veteran
shuttle astronaut C. Gordon Fullerton, who will fly it, she added.
   The test landings will be conducted on paved and dry lakebed
runways at Edwards, on paved runways at Kennedy Space Center, Fla.,
and on unpaved landing strips at White Sands Space Harbor, N.M.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a
statement that the tests ``will give engineers information on what
to expect should an orbiter experience a flat tire or other
anomalies on landing, and will provide data to help in developing
crew procedures for various landing conditions and situations.''
   The agency required all space shuttles to land at Edwards since
April 1985, when Discovery blew a tire and sustained brake damage
landing on a paved runway at Kennedy Space Center. The shuttle
swerved down the runway, but was never out of control and the
astronauts emerged safely. Landing gear and brakes have been
modified, and NASA continues to test them during shuttle landings at
Edwards.
   To prepare the CV-990 for the 1990 test landings, ``we'll armor
plate the belly of the airplane so that if there's debris kicked up,
it won't damage the bottom of the aircraft,'' Lovato said.
   NASA will test brakes and nose gear steering, along with the main
and nose landing gear, wheel and tire assemblies.

<TEXT>
   The National Black Women's Health Project is no
clinic. It's a place where women tell what ails them and hugs are
the order of the day.
   From a rambling, tree-shaded mansion in southwest Atlanta, dozens
of ladies set about healing bodies by healing attitudes, heightening
health awareness for a nation of women who often pay a heavy
physical price just living every day.
   ``If you are living in a house where you are being abused
sexually, physically, emotionally, that is what's on the front of
your mind. You couldn't get too excited about your health,'' said
executive director Byllye Avery.
   Black women are twice as likely as whites to die of diabetes,
three times as likely to die of cervical cancer and 18 times as
likely to have organ damage due to hypertension, the project says.
In addition, 75 percent of female AIDS victims are black, and nearly
half of all black women are mothers by age 20.
   Black women also are three times as likely to be molested or
raped and four times as likely to be murdered, Avery said. The
project's main goal is to ``break the conspiracy of silence''
surrounding women's health.
   With shared experiences, newsletters and films, the project works
in the hope that education will pull black women away from social
evils that inhibit efforts to seek birth control and better
nutrition.
   Every month, the project stages programs on topics such as
``Mothers Too Early Too Long,'' which gathered four generations of
teen mothers to discuss how pregnancy affected their lives; ``Black
&amp; Female: What Is The Reality?'' about social issues that affect
black women; and ``SisterReach,'' which dealt with women's health
issues in Belize, a tiny Central American nation.
   The project also operates a Wellness Center, providing tutorial
and literacy programs, out of an Atlanta housing project.
   ``We create a safe space where sisters can say whatever they need
to say,'' Avery said. ``Where sisters have someone listen to them,
and also have someone struggle with them.''
   And the women come. They laugh and talk. They bring their
daughters.
   The teen-agers deal with such topics as ``Growing Up Is Scary''
and ``What Is A Real Man?'' putting their thoughts in a newsletter.
   ``What we stress is coming together and taking the risk to start
talking openly with each other about the realities of our lives,''
Avery said. ``It's through that analysis that women then learn what
to do about certain parts of their health. It helps break down the
alienation and isolation that black women feel.''
   The project was launched at Spelman College in June 1983, during
a conference on black women's health issues. Planners expected 200
to 300 women; nearly 2,000 showed up.
   ``We knew then there was a need among the sisters to organize
around health,'' Avery said. ``Before us, nobody even knew the words
`black women's health issues.' We coined the term and put it out
there.''
   Now, the project functions in 22 states, from Pennsylvania to
California, with about 2,000 active members. Its annual meeting is
slated this month in Dahlonega. Regional retreats already have been
held in New York and Marin County, Calif., and another is in the
works for September in Atlanta.
   ``What we ask each woman to do is not try to change the world,''
Avery said. ``Just try to change herself.''

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Criticism of Trade Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official has rejected criticism from
negotiators in world trade talks that U.S. policy undermined efforts
to liberalize international trade.
   Delegates at a special meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade condemned provisions in the 1988 U.S. trade act
which call for penalties against countries deemed to be especially
protectionist.
   Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the 96-nation organization,
issued an appeal Wednesday that governments should not take action
outside GATT's international trade rules as unilateral measures had
been tried before and failed, the spokesman said.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Rufus Yerxa told the special
closed session of the GATT council that the United States ``would
not apologize for actions taken in trying to pursue its trade
objectives,'' and said the Bush administration was committed to the
current four-year round of global trade-freeing talks, according to
a partial text of his speech released to journalists.
   But EEC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh warned in the closed meeting of
the possible ``sinking of the GATT because of an error of U.S.
judgment,'' a GATT spokesman said.
   Last month the U.S. administration singled out Japan, Brazil and
India for priority action under the so-called 301 section of its
trade act because of alleged serious violations against fair trade.
   The three countries face 100 percent tariffs on selected exports
to the United States if they do not remove the offending barriers to
U.S. goods within 18 months.
   Yerxa told the meeting Wednesday that the United States had taken
no action under the new procedure other than ``to identify trade
liberalizing priorities'' in areas which are ``significant barriers
to world trade.''
   Arguing that the United States was ``remarkably open'' in the
face of a huge trade deficit, he said that 60 percent of all Third
World exports of manufactured goods go to the United States, twice
as many as the European Economic Community and five times as many as
Japan received.
   Brazilian ambassador Rubens Ricupero said the U.S. action
``undermines and puts in jeopardy the whole Uruguay Round,'' and
``has already wasted and ruined the precious capital of goodwill''
built up during the talks.
   Indian representative Bal Krishan Zutshi said the implementation
of the 301 provisions would ``emasculate the multilateral trading
system.''
   Japanese ambassador Joshio Hatano cited U.S. disregard of the
system within the GATT for settling trade disputes.
   ``To be judge, jury and executioner at the same time is not
acceptable,'' he told the meeting.
   Copies of the texts from the Brazilian, Japanese and Indian were
made available to journalists.
   The GATT spokesman said that Dunkel told the meeting that GATT
had been established in 1948 after ``unilateralism and bilateralism
had been tried and failed.''
   Dunkel told the meeting if the drafters of the founding agreement
were still alive, ``they would have asked in despair, do world
economic relations have to go through the same cycle again? Can the
present generation of trade policy makers not learn from the
experiences of a previous one?'' the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Government Allows Boeing 737-400 Jets To Fly With Power Curb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Civil Aviation Authority has lifted its
grounding order on 12 Boeing 737-400 jets operated by British
airlines as long as modifications are made to cut the engines' power.
   The planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in
which 737-400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan
blades broke in their CFM 56-3C engines.
   The engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint
venture between SNECMA of France and General Electric Co. of the
United States.
   Britain's CAA said Wednesday it was imposing power cuts that
effectively lower the engines' thrust to that of a previous
generation of the make.
   Airlines were also ordered to replace the engines' fan blades and
discs. Regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face
of the engine discs will also be required, the CAA said.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously, said airlines were already
making the modifications and some 737-400s could be back in
operation on Thursday.
   The grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a DanAir
jet at Gatwick Airport on June 9 and on a British Midland Airways
aircraft at Heathrow Airport on June 11.
   Fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the
engine failure which led to the crash in January of a British
Midland 737-400 near East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire,
killing 47.
   The Civil Aviation Authority had originally said it did not
believe that lowering the engines' power would solve the problem.
But a CAA spokesman said the agency had been convinced by tests
showing the fan blade failure occurred at a certain level of thrust.
   ``We are putting the clock back to the previous standard and we
are satisfied that restores the necessary safety margin,'' he said.
   British airlines using 737-400s said they had managed to keep
flying on schedule by using spare aircraft or borrowing
replacements. In addition to British Midland and DanAir, 737-400s
are operated by Novair, Air Europe and Air UK-Leisure.

   Toronto Sun Publishing Corp. has acquired
seven Central Florida weekly shopping guides and newspapers, along
with their printing plant, from Westminster Florida Inc. for $14.5
million.
   Included in the deal were the News-Gazette in Kissimmee and
shopping guides in Orlando, Kissimmee, Bradenton, Longboat Key,
Sarasota and Venice, along with the Bradenton plant that prints all
of them.
   Sun publisher Douglas Creighton said Tuesday he didn't plan any

<TEXT>
   Brunswick Corp. says it will sell its
1,300-employee industrial-products division as part of its strategy
to concentrate on recreational, defense and aerospace products.
   The division manufactures Vapor brand door-operating systems for
buses and trains at plants in Niles, Ill., and Montreal, as well as
Vapor air-conditioning systems in Montgomery, Ala.
   The unit also supplies the energy industry with oilfield valves
and controls manufactured by its TXT-Cooper operation in Houston.
   The industrial-products division had sales of about $150 million
in 1988 but suffered a decline in operating earnings.
   ``It's not a highly profitable business, but they definitely make
money,'' Brunswick spokesman Ross Stemer said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   Stemer would not reveal the unit's operating income for 1988.
   Brunswick as a whole reported sales of $3.28 billion last year
and net income of $193 million.
   Stemer said Brunswick was already holding discussions with
prospective buyers, but had not set a deadline for selling the
division. He said the unit might be sold as a whole or in pieces.
   Brunwick, based in this north Chicago suburb, is an international
leader in marine power, pleasure boating, recreational, defense and
aerospace products.
   Its brands include Mercury and Mariner outboard motors, Bayliner
and Sea Ray pleasure boats, Zebco fishing gear, Brunswick bowling
equipment and Circle Seal controls.

<HEAD>FDIC Chairman: More Institutions Will Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the savings and loan bailout bill now in
Congress will go far toward eliminating the likelihood of another
S&amp;L debacle, dozens more thrifts will fail before the measure become
law, says the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``Institutions will have to be closed. People will lose their
jobs. Defaulting borrowers will be sued,'' L. William Seidman said
Wednesday in a speech to financial journalists in New York.
   ``Large amounts of property will be sold in difficult markets.
And, of course, the taxpayers will bear the burden through future
taxes,'' he said.
   The FDIC has taken control of 223 savings and loans in the last
few months at the request of the Bush administration.
   ``We expect that number to increase to almost 300 by the time the
president signs the S&amp;L bill,'' Seidman said.
   Seidman said he expects President Bush will sign the new bailout
bill by August. The measure is aimed at correcting the mistakes of
the last decade, he said.
   However, one thing that has yet to be addressed is the industry's
interest-rate mismatching, where S&amp;Ls essentially borrow short but
lend long in fixed-rate mortgages, and where the cost of loaning
money is higher than the interest paid on savings.
   Bills already passed in the House and Senate require stronger
capital for S&amp;Ls based on standards used for banks. They also call
for factual accounting, ``rather than the ill-fated `smoke and
mirrors' of the past,'' Seidman said.
   In addition, they call for double supervision of S&amp;Ls, with the
FDIC serving as the backup supervisor for the industry, and for
creation of a comprehensive vehicle called the Resolution Trust
Corp. to handle insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   He said the FDIC may play a role in operating the RTC, which he
said may have to handle about $400 billion in assets from failed
institutions.
   ``To give you a view of the size of the job, the FDIC in its
entire existence has dealt with about $160 billion in assets,'' he
said.
   Seidman also said that banks are continuing to fail at a high
rate. So far this year, 96 banks have failed or required government
assistance, about the same number as in 1988.
   The FDIC expects 150 to 180 bank failures in 1989, down from last
year's post-Depression record of 221, Seidman said. The prediction,
he said, was based on a decline in the number of ``problem banks''
to 1,282 now compared with a high of 1,624 in June 1987.
   But Seidman predicted there would be a dramatic drop in the
amount of bank assets and deposits handled by the FDIC.
   ``We anticipate handling about $10 billion of assets in 1989, or
about 12 percent of what we handled last year,'' he said.
   Seidman reiterated that the S&amp;L rescue will be the costliest
financial bailout in U.S. history _ more than the ``Marshall Plan,
Chrysler, New York City and Penn Central bailouts all combined, and
by a mile.''
   ``In fact, it will probably cost every man, woman and child in
the U.S. about $1,000 each,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fed Seeks to Erode Barrier Between Banks and Securities Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board has taken took a step
that could result in the further erosion of the 56-year-old barrier
between commercial banking and the securities business.
   The Fed asked Wednesday for public comment on a proposal to
permit subsidiaries of bank holding companies to double the amount
of securities business they conduct.
   Since the 1933 passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which was
enacted after the 1929 stock market crash rippled into a banking
crisis, banks have been prohibited from being ``principally
engaged'' in underwriting securities.
   The Fed has interpreted that clause as allowing holding company
subsidiaries to engage in securities underwriting up to 5 percent of
their revenue. The agency is considering doubling the loophole to 10
percent and asked for comment on that by July 20.
   Both moves are likely to displease leaders of the House and
Senate Banking committees, which view changes in the Glass-Steagall
Act as requiring congressional, not regulatory, action.
Congressional banking leaders have promised to begin considering
Glass-Steagall reform soon after Congress enacts President Bush's
savings and loan bailout.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, strongly protested a Fed decision in January that added
corporate bond underwriting to the list of securities activities
open to banks.
   This week, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. became the first bank given final
permission to start exercising that power.
   The Fed also has said that early next year it will begin
considering opening corporate stock underwriting to banks.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Governor Heller Quits, Citing Salary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H. Robert Heller, citing financial hardships in
living on his $82,500-a-year government salary, says he will resign
as one of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board.
   An expert in international economics, Heller said Wednesday he
would return to California to become an executive vice president of
Visa International, the giant credit card company.
   In a meeting with reporters, he refused to disclose his exact
salary at Visa, saying only that it would be a ``pretty sizable''
increase that would represent a multiple of his government pay.
   Heller specifically cited Congress' rejection earlier this year
of a proposed federal pay raise as one factor in his decision to
leave. Under the proposal, which would have boosted congressional
salaries as well as those of top officials, the pay of a Federal
Reserve governor would have risen to $125,000.
   His resignation will give President Bush his first opportunity to
appoint someone to the Federal Reserve Board. The other six members,
including Chairman Alan Greenspan, were appointed by former
President Reagan.
   Economists said it was unlikely Heller's surprise departure would
affect policy at the central bank.
   Heller generally espoused supply-side monetary views emphasizing
economic growth, appearing at times to be at odds with the tough
anti-inflation leanings of former Chairman Paul Volcker.
   Bush, who early in the year complained that the central bank was
risking a recession by a too-tight money policy, was likely to
appoint a replacement very close to Heller's philosophy, analysts
predicted.
   ``I would expect the appointment will be someone who is at least
as dovish on inflation as Heller was,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   The replacement by law must come from a Federal Reserve regional
bank district not now represented on the board. Heller came from the
San Francisco region, which will now be vacant. Other regions not
now represented on the board are Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta,
St. Louis and Minneapolis.
   Heller joined the board in August 1986 and his replacement will
fill a term that lasts until Jan. 31, 1996.
   In his resignation letter, Heller said he was leaving for
``personal considerations.'' He told reporters he had taken a
significant pay cut to join the government and that with two
children approaching college age he found that ``financially, it
gets tougher and tougher.''
   Before joining the Federal Reserve, Heller served as a senior
vice president and director of international economic research for
Bank of America in San Francisco.
   Heller, who was born in Germany and is a naturalized American
citizen, said the Visa job offered him the chance to return to San
Francisco and to use his international experience in dealing with
Visa's operations in 185 countries.
   Heller, 49, was generally recognized as the international expert
on the board and several economists said they expected that Bush
would take that and ideological considerations into consideration
when choosing a replacement.
   ``I think the White House would want somebody ... willing to
ensure that economic growth is maintained at some expense on the
inflation front,'' said Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago.

<HEAD>House Democrat Offers Alternative Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Democrat has proposed raising the
minimum wage to $4.25 by next year, but his attempt at breaking an
impasse between Congress and President Bush contains provisions the
White House has insisted it won't accept.
   Rep. Austin J. Murphy, D-Pa., introduced a revised minimum-wage
bill Wednesday, a week after Bush vetoed legislation that would have
raised the wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by 1991.
   The House last week was unable to override the veto, Bush's first.
   Murphy, chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over
the minimum wage, proposed raising the hourly minimum wage to $3.80
on Oct. 1 and to $4.25 a year later.
   His final target matches that of Bush, although the minimum wage
would not reach $4.25 an hour until January 1992 under the
president's proposal.
   Murphy's proposal gave no ground on the issue on which the
majority Democrats in Congress and Bush have their greatest
difference _ whether employers should be allowed to pay newly hired
workers a subminimum wage for an initial training period.
   Bush has said he will not support any increase in the minimum
wage unless Congress also establishes a new subminimum wage
employers could pay all new workers for up to six months.
   Democrats intially resisted any attempts to establish a
subminimum wage, but eventually included in the measure Bush vetoed
a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to workers with fewer
than 60 days' work experience.
   Murphy included the same 60-day provision in his bill.
   ``I reject the president's call for a six-month training wage,
mainly because it is excessive and unfair,'' Murphy said in a
statement.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has re-introduced legislation in
the Senate identical to the measure Bush vetoed, but has indicated a
willingness to discuss a compromise with the White House.
   Administration officials have said Bush's proposal is the only
acceptable one.

<HEAD>Eastern Asks Court to Cut Pilot Pay, Increase Work Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines attorney says the carrier's move
to end its contract with striking pilots and cut wages is a matter
of economics, but the pilots union says it reflects management's
anti-labor attitude.
   ``The albatross around Eastern's neck is not labor costs, but an
inept and rapacious management,'' the Air Line Pilots Association
said in a statement late Wednesday.
   Eastern on Wednesday asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York
to terminate the contract its pilots had been working under before
the Machinists union in March led a massive work stoppage that
crippled the airline.
   The Miami-based carrier also is seeking approval for a permanent
increase in the number of hours a pilot may work each month and
about $50 million in temporary wage and benefit concessions.
   ``This is not a union-busting tactic,'' said Eastern attorney
Harvey Miller. ``This is an economic problem.''
   Eastern officials said the new conditions are supported by pilots
who have continued to fly during the strike and are similar to cuts
taken by management and other non-union employees during the
3-month-old strike.
   The pilots union said Eastern's actions came as no surprise.
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo ``is following basically
the same pattern of harsh treatment for workers that he established
when he took Continental Airlines into bankruptcy and abrogated its
labor contracts there in 1983,'' ALPA's statement said.
   Lorenzo abrogated union contracts with employees of Continental,
like Eastern a Texas Air subsidiary, after he put Continental into
bankruptcy protection. The carrier, based in Houston, is now
non-union.
   But the pilots union said Wednesday it expects Lorenzo to have a
``much more difficult time'' doing the same with Eastern because
Congress tightened the bankruptcy laws after the Continental episode
to make it harder for companies to cancel contracts through
bankruptcy reorganization. Now a company must show it is negotiating
in good faith.
   Miller said Eastern sought termination of the pilots' contract,
which expired a year ago, in order to move ahead with rebuilding
plans because the union had balked at negotiating a new contract.
Eastern had about 3,600 pilots before the strike, but plans to
rebuild into a smaller carrier with about 1,700 pilots.
   Under Section 1113 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the court has 14
to 21 days to schedule a hearing and 30 days to rule on Eastern's
request.
   Eastern is seeking to cut the pilots' pay by 10 percent for six
months, 5 percent for the next six months and to delay vacations
until next year. Wage and pension-plan concessions would be restored
by half on Jan. 31, 1990, and in full by August 1990.
   The airline also is asking for permanent work rule changes. The
airline wants to be able to schedule pilots to fly 68 hours a month
in 1990 and 60 hours a month thereafter, compared with the
pre-strike 46 hours. Federal regulations allow a pilot to fly an
average of 85 hours a month, with a maximum of 100 hours.
   The Machinists went on strike March 4 after federal mediation
failed. The pilots' contract is still open to negotiation and
normally would have to go through federal mediation, but Miller said
the airline can seek to end the contract because the company is in
Chapter 11.

   The strongest United Auto Workers
dissident movement in 40 years has lost a seat on the union's
executive board, but the UAW's leadership may be hearing more from
the New Directions group.
   Jerry Tucker of St. Louis was defeated for re-election Wednesday
as director of UAW Region 5 in eight south-central states, losing to
Roy Wyse of the Kansas City area.
   Tucker and New Directions have criticized UAW President Owen
Bieber for allegedly stifling dissent within the UAW and losing
sight of the 1 million-member union's roots by making to cooperative
labor agreements with automakers.
   Bieber and members of his Administration Caucus have denied the
charges. But the New Directions effort has gained widespread
rank-and-file support and is the most serious challenge to the UAW's
leadership since the mid-1940s, when Walter Reuther was solidifying
control of the then-fledgling union.
   After the regional director election, one New Directions member
asked Bieber to set aside the entire vote and hold another election
within two months.
   That brought catcalls and mild obscenities from Wyse supporters.
Bieber ruled the motion out of order.
   On his way out of the caucus, Victor Reuther, brother of Walter
Reuther and a backer of Tucker's efforts, said a similar motion
could be brought before the convention today.
   Tucker had little to say immediately after the loss, other than
that he had not decided about whether he would take the election
challenge to court. Tucker was chosen director of Region 5 in a
federally supervised election Sept. 1, 1988, after he challenged an
earlier election in court. He lost that contest by an extremely
narrow margin.
   Wyse, appointed by Bieber as an assistant director in Region 5
three years ago, said after his election that union members ``saw
through the New Directions movement. They saw they had questions but
no answers.
   ``I think it's the beginning of the end for the New Directions
movement,'' he said.
   Wyse said he would try to reconcile the two camps in his huge
region. But, he added: ``It will take a while. There are some scars
out there that need to be healed.''
   That was evident in the packed hotel room where the caucus was
held. Both sides wore jackets with their candidates' names on the
back _ Tucker's forces in blue and Wyse's in white.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Administration Caucus's slate of top union
officers was elected to three-year terms without opposition.
   Bieber won his third term as the union's president. Incumbent
Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens was elected to a full term after
succeeding the late Raymond Majerus, who died Jan. 14, 1988.
   Delegates also elected four vice presidents _ two incumbents and
two to succeed the retiring Donald Ephlin and Marc Stepp.
   Bieber will assign responsibilities to his new vice presidents.
It's expected that Stephen Yokich will move from the union's Ford
Department to head the General Motors Department, succeeding Ephlin;
newly elected vice president Ernie Lofton will succeed Yokich; and
Stan Marshall, also elected as vice president Wednesday, will follow
Stepp as director of the Chrysler Department.
   Vice President Odessa Kommer, the union's most senior vice
president having been elected first in 1974, probably will keep many
of her responsibilities, including oversight of the union's
relations with a number of automotive supplier companies.

   Paramount Communications Inc. has gone to court
to block Time Inc.'s proposed $14 billion buyout of Warner
Communications Inc.
   But a cable operator that is 82 percent-owned by Time said
Paramount is running into opposition from local officials over its
own plans to acquire the operator's cable franchises in connection
with a hostile $10.7 billion bid for Time.
   Meanwhile, Paramount asked the New York Stock Exchange to
investigate Time's bid for Warner on the ground that the companies
may have violated exchange rules. The exchange said it would comply
with the request.
   Those were among the developments Wednesday in what is shaping up
as a fiercely contested takeover battle that could produce one of
the world's largest communications companies no matter who wins.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time rose
$4.75 a share to $157.25 on Wednesday after losing $19 in the
previous three sessions.
   Warner fell $1 a share to $58.50 while Paramount lost 12{ cents a
share to $59.25.
   Paramount filed a 49-page amendment to an earlier suit in
Delaware Chancery Court on Wednesday in which it said Time acted
improperly in rejecting Paramount's buyout offer and launching its
own takeover bid for Warner.
   The complaint said the offer for Warner ``amounts to a
multibillion dollar abuse of Time's stockholders for the purpose of
protecting the secure and prosperous future of Time and Warner
management.''
   Paramount also asked that the court nullify results of the
upcoming election of four Time board members. Time's chairman and
chief executive, J. Richard Munro, and its president, Nicholas J.
Nicholas Jr., are nominees.
   Paramount said the pending election is a sham because no opposing
candidates have been nominated.
   In response to the amended complaint, Time said in a statement
that Paramount's allegations were without merit.
   Time said it would ``respond to the complaint in the proper forum
_ Delaware Chancery Court _ and demonstrate clearly its position and
the merits of its case.''
   In its amendment to the suit, Paramount also claimed that a stock
swap recently completed between Time and Warner violated NYSE rules
that require shareholder approval for such a transaction.
   If the Big Board finds that Time or Warner had violated its
rules, it could bar the merged company from trading its shares on
the exchange.
   A hearing on Paramount's suit is set for July 11.
   Paramount, an entertainment and publishing concern, launched a
$175 a share tender offer for Time's stock on June 6, only 2{ weeks
before Time and Warner shareholders originally were to vote on a
merger of the companies.
   Time, a leading magazine and book publisher and cable programmer
and operator, rejected Paramount's offer Friday, saying it was
inadequate and highly conditional and that securing regulatory
approvals for cable system transfers alone would take a year or more.
   Time also said it had revised its merger agreement with Warner to
provide a $70-a-share buyout of the movie, record and cable concern.
   While shareholder approval was needed for the original merger,
Time's shareholders are not being asked to vote on the acquisition
of Warner's stock.
   Meanwhile, the cable operator American Television and
Communications Corp. said Wednesday local opposition is growing to
Paramount's plans for acquiring cable franchises associated with
Time.
   ATC, based in Stamford, Conn., has said Paramount's acquisition
of Time is illegal because the change in control would place ATC in
violation of many of its cable franchise agreements.
   It said officials from the states of Kansas and Hawaii and 16
cities including Indianapolis, Denver, Kansas City, Mo., and
Charlotte, N.C. have complained to federal officials that
Paramount's takeover plan abrogates the local right of prior
approval for cable franchise ownership in their areas.
   ATC also said that Paramount has indicated in a court filing in
Connecticut that it won't meet the July 5 deadline set in its tender
offer for Time.
   Asked for a response, Paramount said it intends to extend the
expiration date of its tender offer until after the Delaware court
decision.
   Paramount also said it expects to get cable franchise approval
``where required by state and local law in an orderly and
expeditious way.''
   In its amended complaint in the Delaware court , Paramount argues
that Time's management ``launched a massive campaign to block the
Paramount offer'' before Time's board made its public statement on
the merits of the offer.
   The complaint said that before the board acted, Time wrote to at
least 22 state attorneys general, urging them to oppose any action
by Paramount to get quick approval of its offer.
   Paramount said Time failed in moving the date of its annual
meeting to June 30 from June 23 to adjust the May 1 record date for
eligibility to vote, even though the company acknowledged that a
large number of shares have since changed hands. It also noted the
meeting will not deal with any aspect of the Time-Warner merger plan
but only election of directors, who are unopposed.
   ``The board's action make one thing clear: Time is being run
solely for the benefit of its management,'' the suit said.

   The U.S. dollar fell in early trading today against
all European currencies and the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices were higher, moving up on the dollar's weakness.
   Traders said they were puzzled by the dollar's direction.
   ``We're all trying to determine what kind of consolidation phase
this is. It doesn't fit any of the patterns,'' said one analyst in
Milan, Italy.
   ``Frequent reversals and sharp rallies are both possible,'' said
another analyst in Milan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before the European markets open,
the dollar closed at 141.40, down 3.55 yen from Wednesday's close.
Later in London, it was trading at 140.75 yen.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.9525 West German marks, down
from 1.9680; 1.6830 Swiss francs, down from 1.7005; 6.6250 French
francs, down from 6.6795; 2.2002 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2375;
1,418.55 Italian lire, down from 1.439.50; and 1.1920 Canadian

   In London, one British pound cost $1.5615, compared with $1.54675
late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at $370.70 an ounce, up from $366.75 late
Wednesday. At mid-morning, the city's five major gold dealers fixed
a recommended price of $370.40.
   In Zurich, gold was selling at $370 this morning, up from $366.40
late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $370.49, up from $366.57 late
Wednesday.
   Gold moved up $5.75 in New York trading on Wednesday following a
late rally on the New York Commodity Exchange that pushed the price
as high as $372.40. Dealers said gold was reacting to a weaker

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell slightly.
   The dollar closed at 141.40 yen, down 3.55 yen from Wednesday's
close of 144.95 yen. It opened at 141.75 yen, its high for the day,
and fell as low as 140.35 yen.
   It was the dollar's lowest close since 140.65 yen on June 5. It
had climbed to 151.30 a week ago.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 20.31
points, or 0.06 percent, ending at 33,324.97. The index, a
111.81-point gainer the previous day, inched up in early trading
today, then turned downward.
   Kenji Ishizuka, a dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the
market lost energy and became directionless after its early gains.
   ``Following last week's large losses, the market's energy has not
come back yet,'' he said. Affected by large swings in the dollar-yen
exchange rate, the Nikkei lost more than 1,100 points last week.
   Most investors retreated to the sidelines in the afternoon
session, making trading thin, Ishizuka said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 550 million
shares, down from Wednesday's 600 million.
   On the foreign exchange market, traders said expectations for a
higher dollar had disappeared after its sharp downswing in New York
overnight, triggered by reports of new government efforts to hold it
below 140 yen.
   Masafumi Koyama, an analyst with the Bank of Tokyo, said any
rumors or remarks suggesting a lower dollar could be a strong
dollar-selling incentive now.
   ``A majority of Japanese investors sold the dollar, trying to see
how far they could push it down to reach an appropriate dollar-yen
rate,'' he said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold dollars to help push the U.S.
currency down, but neither the amount nor the intervention itself
had been confirmed, Koyama said.
   ``The market took the central bank action as showing its
intention to eventually push the dollar below the 140 yen mark,'' he
said.
   Koyama said it still was too early to determine the market trend.
   ``That's why many investors have been avoiding major moves, and
just making position adjustments,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   President Bush may not have envisioned such a
summit, but his clean-air proposals have the Big Three automakers
talking to each other.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have been
discussing ways to beat Japanese and European competitors to market
with cleaner-running cars, but have not decided whether to
collaborate in their efforts.
   ``I don't know if that's possible or not,'' Ford spokesman Dick
Judy said Wednesday.
   Ward's Automotive Reports said Wednesday it would report in its
upcoming edition that the big U.S. automakers might seek an
antitrust waiver for research on emissions controls, alternate fuels
and fuel economy steps to meet new regulations proposed by Congress
and the Bush administration.
   Congress granted an antitrust exemption under the National
Cooperative Research Act for joint research begun by the Big Three
in 1988 on composite materials, Ward's said in a news release.
   Judy confirmed that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler executives
met to talk about environmental and energy questions.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen and Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling
hosted the June 6 meeting in Dearborn, Judy said. GM Chairman Roger
Smith and Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald attended, he said.
   ``It was a discussion of everyone's points of view on subjects
which have been made public in recent congressional testimony,'' the
spokesman said.
   He cited testimony by Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for
environmental and safety engineering, that the company could support
pooling of industry and government research efforts on
anti-pollution and fuel-saving technologies.
   Judy said he did not know of any further meetings among the
automakers.
   U.S. Department of Transportation, National Transportation Safety
Board and Environmental Protection Agency spokesmen said the
agencies were not involved in the automakers' discussions.
   GM spokesman Jim Crellin said the executives met to discuss
mutual clean-air and energy policy concerns. ``It was a private
meeting, and we are not discussing the subjects,'' he said.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said the discussion involved
non-competitive environmental and energy issues. She also would not
elaborate.

<HEAD>Air Bags Standard On Chrysler 1990 Cars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As automakers adopt inflatable air bags as a means
of meeting tighter requirements for safety restraints, Chrysler
Corp. says it will install driver's-side air bags on all its 1990
cars.
   About 1 million Chrysler cars will have the devices in the coming
model year, the No. 3 automaker said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp. said driver's-side air bags will be standard
on 15 of its 1990 car lines, or about 500,000 cars. Ford Motor Co.
said it will install them on nine major lines, an expected 1 million
cars.
   ``Part of it is meeting the passive restraint requirements,''
Chrysler spokesman Ben Dunn said, adding that company surveys show
safety is a top concern among customers.
   In addition to air bags, Dunn said Chrysler is equipping 17 of
its U.S.-built 1990 models with rear-seat lap and shoulder belts
rather than just lap belts. The automaker also will offer antilock
braking systems on 26 of its more than 30 car and truck lines in
1990, he said.
   Starting in 1990, federal regulations require front-seat passive
restraints in cars, comprising either manual safety belts
supplemented by driver's-side air bags or passive belt systems, GM
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said.
   Passive restraints don't require an action such as buckling a
seat belt. Passive belt systems are partly anchored to the car door
so the belt wraps around the occupant when the door is closed.
   By 1993, air bag protection or passive belts will be required for
front seat passengers as well as drivers, Simonetti said.
   Passenger-side air bags are in the works but are harder to
design, she and Dunn said.
   ``The driver is in a fixed position, plus you have a natural home
for the air bag in the steering wheel assembly,'' Dunn said. ``On
the passenger side you have to engineer it to travel a greater
distance, and you don't know what position the passenger might be
in.''

<HEAD>Anti-Takeover Plan Enacted at Disney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. has adopted a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover defense but says it does not know of any
prospective bids for the company.
   The plan adopted by Disney's board of directors and announced
Wednesday would entitle present stockholders to buy new stock at
half price in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. Such plans
dilute the holdings of a potential buyer, making a buyout without
management consent prohibitively expensive.
   The plan is similar to those adopted at many American
corporations in recent years, and has been under consideration at
Disney for several months, said spokesman Tom Deegan.
   ``It was not as a result of anything that has happened in the
last several weeks,'' Deegan said. He was referring to the three-way
buyout battle among Paramount Communications, Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc., and to a trend toward consolidation of media
giants.
   ``While we are not aware of any effort to acquire control of the
company, the stockholder rights plan represents a sound and
reasonable means of safeguarding the interests of all
stockholders,'' Disney said in a news release.

<HEAD>Economy Grew at 4.4 Percent Pace in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs files; trims at bottom to shorten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.4
percent in the first three months of the year, slightly better than
previously believed, the government reported today.
   However, the Commerce Department said more than half the growth
in the gross national product came from a rebound from last summer's
drought, a one-time boost that is more of a reflection of the
government's accounting methods than a measurement of the real
economy.
   Discounting the bookkeeping entry to return expected farm
production this year to its pre-drought levels, growth actually
slowed dramatically in the January-March quarter.
   The non-farm economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9
percent, compared with a 3.5 percent rate in the final three months
of 1988.
   This slowdown is in line with many economists' expectations.
Private analysts predict the U.S. economy will slow dramatically
this year under the impact of an anti-inflation campaign waged by
the Federal Reserve. The central bank in March 1988 began to drive
interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand.
   The new GNP report contained some good news on the inflation
front as a GNP price index rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent,
down from a preliminary estimate of 5 percent a month ago.
   The increase in the GNP price index that measures a fixed
marketbasket of goods was up only slightly from a 4.2 percent
increase in the fourth quarter of 1988. The government said the
downward revision came from slower price increases for farm products
and industrial supplies than earlier estimated.
   Many analysts are predicting that overall growth will slow this
year to what is known as a growth recession, a period when the
economy keeps expanding but at such a sluggish pace that
unemployment rises.
   Some economists believe that is already occurring. After falling
to a 15-year low in March, the unemployment rate has risen to 5.2
percent, with job growth dropping in May to its slowest pace in
three years.
   While the expectation of slower growth this year is virtually
universal, there is still a hot debate over whether the slowdown
will worsen into a recession, ending the record six-year peacetime
economic recovery.
   The Federal Reserve sent signals last week that it has begun
lowering interest rates slightly. Optimists are hoping that move
will occur in time to revive important sectors of the economy, such
as housing and auto sales, that have been hurt by rising interest
rates.
   The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion
report released today that showed the after-tax profits of American
corporations fell by 1.1 percent in the first three months of 1989.
   It was the first setback for corporate profits since a 2.5
percent decline in the first quarter of 1987.
   The primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall
4.4 percent GNP figure was a better performance in trade than
previously believed.
   The U.S. trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, narrowed by $19.5
billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and
imports fell by 0.5 percent. It was the first quarterly trade
improvement since the spring of 1988.
   In other areas of the economy, consumer spending rose at a
lackluster annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter,
reflecting sluggish auto sales and weak demand in many other retail
areas.
   Housing construction, which has been hard hit by the Fed's
anti-inflation campaign, dropped by 4.6 percent in the first
quarter, the poorest performance in a year.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual level of $4.077 trillion in the first quarter.
   The latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the
Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter put the consensus growth
forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down slightly from the previous
month and significantly below the administration's projection of 3.2
percent.
   If the private economists are proven correct, that would spell
bad news for the administration's hopes of meeting the Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction target of $100 billion next year without a tax
increase.
   Even with the effects of the drought last year, the GNP expanded
at a four-year high of 3.9 percent. That rapid pace helped to drive
unemployment down sharply.
   Many economists believe the unemployment rate will rise steadily
this year and into 1990, hitting 5.7 percent a year from now.
   ``We are looking for the slowdown that started in the first
quarter of the year to continue for the rest of 1989,'' said Cynthia
Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc.
   In its own assessment of the economy, the Fed on Wednesday said
there were indications that growth was slowing and inflationary
pressures were easing in response to the anti-inflation campaign
launched by the central bank in March 1988.
   ``Economic growth for most of the nation continues to advance,
but a number of Federal Reserve districts note ebbing rates of
expansion,'' the Fed said in a survey conducted by the Fed's 12
regional banks.

   A picket was shot and slightly wounded
at a non-union coal mine today, and some of the 42,000 miners off
the job in 10 states say they were theatened with violence if they
returned to work under court order.
   Judges in at least four states have ordered the miners back to
work. Today was the 10th day of wildcat walkouts in support of 1,900
miners on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. since April 5.
   Jamie Blankenship, 18, the son of a disabled miner, was grazed in
the head as he picketed at Hampden Coal Co., a strike-closed mine in
West Virginia. Blankenship, who is not a miner, was treated at a
hospital and released.
   Blankenship was believed to be the first person wounded by
gunfire since the unauthorized walkouts began. Previously, others
had been hurt by rocks.
   State Police said no arrests were made. Officials at Hampden Coal
did not immediately return calls.
   A UMW official said Wednesday that he sees no quick end to the
unauthorized walkouts, citing millions of dollars in fines that
courts have levied against the union.
   ``Our members feel like they're fighting for our whole
organization,'' said Howard Green, a UMW international executive
board member from Charleston. ``They feel the courts are being used
as a means for destroying our organization.''
   Green said miners have shown up for work but have encountered
pickets and refused to cross the line.
   ``I've been warned by pickets, `We'll find out where you live,'''
miner Ted Sanson said. ``The judge didn't understand this part _ the
fear. Are those marshals going to be there when I get off work?''
   Consolidation Coal Co. is seeking back-to-work orders in
north-central West Virginia and said it planned to take similar
action in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
   The company told a federal judge Wednesday that it was losing
$500,000 a day at its north-central operations alone.
   Tazewell County, Va., Circuit Judge N.E. Persin on Wednesday
fined the union $300,000, saying it was responsible for picket line
misconduct that resulted in coal trucks being hit by objects.
   One Alabama company has asked the courts to order miners back to
work, and two others have filed complaints with the National Labor
Relations Board. One company, Jim Walters Resources, said it is
losing $600,000 a day.
   The union already has been assessed fines of $3 million in
Virginia, and a federal judge Wednesday fined six West Virginia
union locals $2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order.
   West Virginia police said shots were fired Wednesday afternoon at
a security guard shack at the Logan-Mingo Mine Co. office near
Gilbert. Guards were in the shack at the time but no one was injured
and no arrests were made.
   In a separate strike, a Raleigh County, W.Va., judge on Wednesday
ordered county and state law enforcement officers to begin
round-the-clock patrols at a New Beckley Mining Corp. operation near
Glen Daniel to prevent violence.
   About 130 miners who have been on strike there since January in a
contract dispute have joined with Pittston miners in several rallies.
   According to union and industry officials, the estimated number
of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts Wednesday are: West
Virginia, 16,000; Illinois, 8,000; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio, 2,660;
Pennsylvania, 6,600; Indiana 1,750; Kentucky, 1,500; Virginia, 755;
Missouri, 350; and Tennessee, 200.

   Rain in the western Corn Belt prompted early

   A slow-moving cold front triggered scattered showers that dropped

<HEAD>Union Announces Accord With Inland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Steelworkers said it reached a
tentative contract settlement early today with Inland Steel
Industries Inc.
   The agreement would cover four years beginning Aug. 1, according
to Jack Parton, the union's chief negotiator with Inland.
   Parton said details would be withheld until the union can explain
the contract to its 12,000 members at the nation's fourth-largest
steel producer.
   The accord was announced as other union bargainers and officials
at National Steel Corp. recoiled from the rank-and-file's surprise
rejection of a tentative, 50-month contract agreement.
   USW members at Bethlehem Steel Corp. overwhelmingly accepted
terms similar to the National settlement.
   National told its 7,000 employees in a letter sent Wednesday the
offer is the best they can expect from a company that trails the
major producers in profits per ton. Customers are already pulling
orders, the company said.
   National's contract expires July 31, and no further bargaining
sessions are scheduled. United Steelworkers negotiator Buddy Davis,
who continues to recommend the offer, said strike plans are being
prepared.
   ``The agreement you turned down would have increased your hourly
compensation, counting inflation, by $6.57 per hour by 1993,''
National Vice President Richard P. Coffee said in an open letter to
USW members.
   ``It would have cost National Steel $95.3 million more a year for
represented employees alone by the end of the contract. That's $7.5
million more than we made in 1988, and 1988 was the most profitable
year for National Steel since 1979,'' he said.
   National rebutted complaints that USW members got more money in
the early stages of their 50-month contract with Bethelehem Steel
Corp.
   ``They gave up more in 1986, and they are catching up to you
now,'' Coffee said.
   Like the Bethlehem agreement ratified recently by union members,
the National offer would have restored past concessions and raised
hourly wages by $1.50 over the contract term.

<HEAD>Pizza Chain Says No Drivers Under 18</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc., the subject of
criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents involving its
delivery drivers, has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers
who are under the age of 18, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said federal law prohibited the
comapny from hiring drivers younger than 18, but in some cases
people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering pizzas.
   Company-owned stores were being told that employees under 18 who
drive should be fired or given other jobs, Hingst said. The move
will affect about 300 employees at Domino's company-owned stores,
about one-third of the Domino's 5,000 stores nationally, he said.
   The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises, which were
being urged to make the same move, Hingst said.
   The company's directive led to confusion at a Miami, Fla.,
Domino's store that gave pink slips to all its under-18 employees on
Wednesday. Those under 18 who don't drive were rehired later that
day, the company stated.
   ``There was some miscommunication on our part,'' Hingst said.
   Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatal accidents in the last year
involving its drivers, but denies the company's 29-year-old promise
to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a telephone order encourages
employees' reckless driving.
   A 17-year-old Domino's driver, Jesse Colson, was killed earlier
this month when his small pickup truck skidded on a rain-slicked
Indiana road and hit a utility pole.
   His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's
guarantee was ``an invitation to break the law.''
   Domino's has stated it knows of 20 fatalities involving Domino's
drivers, pedestrians and others last year, but that accidents were
bound to happen with such a large fleet, believed to be about 75,000
to 80,000 drivers.
   Hingst said the directive on drivers under 18 was ``a reminder to
follow the guidelines.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today defeated a White House-backed
child-care plan offered by Republicans as an alternative to a
broader program sponsored by the chamber's Democratic leadership.
   The GOP plan, defeated on a 56-44 vote, relied almost exclusively
on tax credits, an approach Democrats said would not address the
need for more child-care openings and improved quality of services.
   The Senate then immediately took up the Democratic leadership
plan, which combines direct subsidies to help parents and states pay
for child care with a tax-relief package similar to that proposed by
the Republicans.
   The leadership plan was expected to win approval but, under an
agreement between the parties, would still be subject to amendments.
A final vote was not expected until Friday.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said President
Bush had refused to discuss a compromise on child care, forcing the
partisan showdown.
   ``We've expressed an interest in talking to the White House all
along,'' Mitchell told reporters before the Senate convened. ``The
president and his aides have adamantly refused.''
   Today's votes came a week after the start of debate dominated by
floor speeches by co-authors of the revised Act for Better Child
Care, Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
defending it against Republican attack.
   The Dodd-Hatch bill would authorize $1.75 billion for fiscal 1990
to help parents and states pay for child care.
   Seventy percent of the money would help parents pay for child
care, while the remaining 30 percent would be available to the
states for programs designed to improve the availability and quality
of care.
   The revised ABC bill, in the form of an amendment offered by
Mitchell, includes two tax changes. One would provide up to a $500
credit to low-income families to pay for children's health insurance.
   The other would make the existing dependent care tax credit
refundable to low-income families, some of whom otherwise do not
benefit from the provision because they have no federal tax
liability to which to apply the credit.
   In promoting their alternative, Republican senators have argued
that the ABC bill's subsidy provisions would result in state
bureaucracies that would limit parental choice in child care, a
position Dodd and Hatch have vigorously contested.
   ``We have a decidedly different approach to what is a real
problem,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``The word `choice' is the
critical distinction.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said the Dodd-Hatch plan would ``give
to government the decision as to what kind of child care shall be
provided.''
   The GOP package would also make the dependent care credit
refundable. Its other major provision would expand the existing
Earned Income Tax Credit to provide addition tax relief to
low-income families with children under age 5.
   Hatch, calling that inadequate, said Wednesday the expanded
credit would provide $750 to a poor family with two eligible
children while child care for the two would cost about $6,000 a year.
   Also, he said, using the GOP tax credits alone likely will not
solve child-care problems because parents would not be required to
spend the money on child care.
   Democrats have also attacked the GOP plan for cutting off
eligibility for the expanded credits at age 4, saying children twice
that age and more need child care. The Dodd-Hatch bill allows
payments for children up to age 13.

<HEAD>Battle for British Supermarket Group Heats Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The takeover battle for British supermarket group
Gateway Corp. PLC intensified Thursday as a sweetened offer from
Isosceles PLC was quickly countered by a competing bidder.
   The New York investment firm Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and the
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. raised their bid for Gateway to the
equivalent of about $3.26 billion after Isosceles, a group of
dissatisfied Gateway shareholders, increased their's to about $3.19
billion.
   The U.S. group is trying to rescue Britain's third largest food
retailer from its two-month old takeover fight against Isosceles.
   Gateway, which controls about 11 percent of the $54.6 billion
U.K. grocery market, has supported the Americans.
   Wasserstein Perella and A&amp;P, collectively bidding as Newgateway,
have indicated that if their takeover succeeds they would keep much
of Gateway intact, except for Herman's sporting goods, which would
be sold.
   Isosceles had planned a more radical reorganization and intended
to sell off Gateway food stores.
   The latest Wasserstein Perella and A&amp;P bid is 235 pence ($3.66
dollars) a share, which values Gateway at 2.01 billion pounds ($3.26
billion).
   The Isosceles offer was raised to 230 pence ($3.586) a share from
210 pence ($3.274) a share. Isosceles' total offer for Gateway's
approximately 890 million shares would come to 2.05 billion pounds
($3.19 billion).
   Isosceles said Associated British Foods PLC had agreed to sell
its 15.1 percent holding of Gateway shares at the new price. This
raises Isosceles' stake in Gateway to 41.9 percent.

<HEAD>Bass Makes Offer to Integrated Resources, Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas investor Robert Bass has talked with
Integrated Resources Inc. about investing in the financially
troubled real estate and insurance concern in exchange for a
controlling stake, a source said Thursday.
   Integrated is meeting with several interested parties, including
Bass, about receiving a large capital infusion after the company
last week announced plans to refinance $955 million in short-term
debt, the source, who asked not be identified, said.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a Bass-led group
could be willing to pump as much as $200 million into Integrated
conditional on Integrated stock and bond holders accepting a
restructuring..
   Integrated had announced it would put up almost all of its $7.8
billion in assets and sharply cut back operations after defaulting
on oustanding bonds and commercial paper because of a cash shortage.
   The Bass group would emerge with much of the equity while the
company's common stock would be diluted, the Journal said.
Bondholders would have the security of of a new investor.
   An Integrated spokesman, David Caouette, declined to comment on
the newspaper report.
   After a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange,
Integrated was up 75 cents a share at $4.75 in mid-afternoon
trading. The company's stock has plunged from $15 last week and $40
in 1986.
   Bass, whose widespread holdings include the American Savings
Bank, Bell &amp; Howell and various media, cable television and real
estate properties, is believed to be interested in Integrated's
network of financial consultants who sell a wide variety of
investments ranging from insurance to real estate.
   The New York-based concern has 35 subsidiaries and 750,000
investor accounts.
   The Journal said Bass believes he would be able to calm the
concerns of Integrated Resources' bankers long enough to allow the
company to develop its financial products.
   Bass does not think the company's real estate problems are so
great, and he also believes the company's newer products like
insurance and leveraged buyout fund investments are sound, the paper
reported.
   Under its proposed restructuring, Integrated would replace $955
million in short-term debt with secured borrowings. The company also
said it would cut back its operations substantially.
   The company, which has $1.1 billion in capital, also said it
would concentrate on its core businesses of money management and
mutual funds, variable insurance products and limited partnerships.
   Its debt to be restructured includes outstanding short-term bank
debt, domestic and European commercial paper and notes outstanding
under loan-sale programs.
   About 50 banks are providing short-term loans to Integrated and
the company said it has about 50 to 75 holders of commercial paper
and notes under loan-sale programs.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators took control of three
savings and loans in Georgia on Thursday, bringing the total under
government management to 226 in 32 states.
   The three are First Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Americus; Habersham Federal Savings Bank, Atlanta, and Great
Southern Federal Savings Bank in Savannah. They have combined assets
of about $1.03 billion.
   In a legal maneuver to protect the institutions' assets from the
claims of subordinated debt holders, the government seized the
assets and transferred them to newly created entities, called First
Savings of Americus, Habersham Federal Savings and Loan Association
and Great Southern Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   Since early February, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has
been taking over the most deeply insolvent S&amp;Ls in preparation for
congressional passage of President Bush's S&amp;L bailout. The goal is
to uncover fraud and conserve assets until regulators have the money
to close the institutions or subsidize their sale to new owners.

<TEXT>
   Toshiba Corp. said Thursday it welcomes a planned
U.S. joint venture to produce computer memory chips, a project that
is aimed at competing with Japanese companies such as Toshiba.
   ``We would welcome the comeback of U.S. manufacturers to the DRAM
business, since it would encourage vigorous competition in the
worldwide semiconductor industry and this would lead to the healthy
expansion of the industry,'' a company statement read.
   Seven U.S. chip makers announced Wednesday they intend to recruit
other companies and raise $1 billion for a company, U.S. Memories
Inc., that would produce dynamic random access memory chips, or
DRAMs.
   International Business Machines Corp., which makes DRAMs for its
own use, has agreed to provide the design and manufacturing
technology for the new chips.
   Japanese companies such as Toshiba, NEC Corp., Mitsubishi Ltd.
and Hitachi Ltd. dominate the world market for DRAMs, which are used
in products ranging from computers to military gear and consumer
electronics.
   ``DRAMs are the largest and an ever-growing sector of the
semiconductor business and play the role of technology driver for
all other categories of microchips,'' read a statement from Toshiba
headquarters that was released by Toshiba America Inc. in New York.
   ``It is fully expected therefore that major U.S. companies would
re-enter this market. If IBM, a powerful producer of DRAMs, will be
providing key support for the venture, the new venture could become
a major manufacturing base in the future,'' Toshiba said.

   Avon Products Inc. Thursday said it has
permanently stopped using animals in its product safety tests,
becoming the first major cosmetics maker to do so.
   Animal rights activists praised Avon and said they hoped Avon's
decision would encourage other companies to completely halt animal
testing.
   The beauty products company said it will rely on alternative
non-animal methods, harmless tests on people and an extensive
computerized data base containing information on the safety of
ingredients that previously have been examined.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company has been working since the early 1980s to reduce
the number of animals used in evaluating its beauty products and to
find other means.
   ``This marks the successful conclusion of that program,'' Preston
said. He had said months ago that the company intended to make the
temporary ban permanent.
   Susan Rich, coordinator of a campaign to abolish animal testing
organized by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, welcomed
Avon's decision.
   ``It's wonderful news. It's historic news,'' said Rich. ``Avon
made a compassionate and progressive decision. We hope it encourages
other companies to follow suit.''
   PETA, which had made Avon the focus of an international campaign,
said that it now will target Revlon Inc., Gillette Co. and Cosmair
Inc.
   Before deciding to permanently stop animal testing, a practice
Avon had temporarily discontinued earlier this year, Avon had its
new procedures reviewed by private scientists specializing in eye
care, skin care and poisons.
   The Food and Drug Administration was told of Avon's new
procedures. The federal agency is responsible for monitoring the
safety of cosmetics but its approval is not required for testing
procedures.
   No U.S. law specifically requires cosmetics to be tested on
animals. FDA officials have said in the past that as a matter of
practicality companies wouldn't use tests that government
authorities considered inadequate.
   Preston said in a news release that until a broader range of
non-animal tests are available, some suppliers to the cosmetics
industry might have to continue to do some animal testing as
formulas containing new raw ingredients are developed.
   Last year, Preston said, Avon approved 95 percent of its formulas
through analysis using its data base, which is the foundation of its
new evaluation procedures.
   Numerous companies in the cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical
industries for years have been exploring ways that don't involve
animals to ensure that new products work as intended and that
consumers aren't harmed by them.
   Avon is among many companies that donate money to fund research
into possible replacements for traditional animal tests. Avon said
Thursday that the company will continue to fund research.
   Researchers around the country have been experimenting with cell
cultures, bacteria, living tissue in test tubes and computer
simulations, plus other potential testing methods.
   In February, Avon announced it was no longer using the Draize eye
irritation test, which has been widely used by industries for more
than 50 years. The company replaced the Draize test, which uses
rabbits, with a test-tube evaluation process developed by the
National Testing Corp. of Palm Springs, Calif.
   Avon, one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of cosmetics
in the world, disbanded its own animal-testing operation last summer
and has said it hasn't asked independent laboratories to conduct
tests on animals since mid-March of this year.
   Other beauty products companies also have announced temporary
suspensions or reductions in the use of animal tests.

<HEAD>Former Trader Pleads Innocent In Securities Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Wall Street trader John A. Mulheren Jr.
pleaded innocent Thursday to charges he assisted the securities
fraud schemes of Ivan F. Boesky, the jailed stock speculator he is
accused of plotting to kill.
   Mulheren, 39, of Rumson, N.J., was arraigned before a federal
magistrate in Manhattan on a 42-count indictment handed up last week.
   Mulheren was charged with manipulating the price of Gulf &amp;
Western Inc. common stock at Boesky's request and arranging a series
of sham stock transactions to help Boesky companies evade taxes and
circumvent securities laws.
   Last month, Mulheren pleaded innocent in New Jersey to state
weapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot on
Boesky's life. Mulheren was arrested in February 1988 near his home
with a loaded semiautomatic rifle that local authorities alleged he
planned to use against Boesky.
   He previously had been charged in federal court with threatening
a witness stemming from the New Jersey case and was freed on $20
million bond. Federal officials have never identified the alleged
target, but New Jersey police have said it was Boesky.
   Prosecutors said the federal charge of threatening a witness
would be dropped in favor of the state weapons possession charges.
   At a bail hearing on the securities case, U.S. District Judge
Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum denied defense attorney Thomas Puccio's
request to reduce his bond.
   Puccio argued that Mulheren poses no danger to the community and
that the bond was unreasonably high.
   But because the defense had not shown the bond caused Mulheren
hardship, Cedarbaum said: ``I am not persuaded that I should reduce
the bail that is in place today.''
   Mulheren was charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and keeping fraudulent records. If convicted, he faces a
maximum five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count.
   Mulheren was a general partner and chief trader at Jamie
Securities, a now-defunct Manhattan investment and arbitrage firm.
   Also arraigned with Mulheren Thursday was Leonard DeStefano, 32,
a former trader at Jamie. He was named on three counts of
conspiracy, mail fraud and fraudulent record keeping.
   DeStefano also pleaded innocent and was released on $125,000 bond.
   Boesky, whose guilty plea led to a series of Wall Street
investigations, is serving a three-year sentence at a minimum
security prison in California. He also paid $100 million in fines
and restitution to settle civil insider trading charges in late 1986.

   Stock prices bounced out of a three-session slump
today with encouragement from declining interest rates.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged to see interest rates
decline slightly in the government securities market in spite of a
mixed dollar in foreign exchange.
   But many Wall Streeters were still treading cautiously as they
awaited indications of the Federal Reserve's next move in its credit
policy.
   The Commerce Department today revised its figure for growth of
the gross national product in the first quarter to an annual rate of
4.4 percent, after adjustment for inflation. Previously the
department had estimated it at 4.3 percent.
   Analysts said such a small adjustment wasn't enough to stir the
market out of its recent lethargy.

   The United States came in for renewed criticism at
world trade talks Thursday for threatening unilateral action against
countries accused of blocking U.S. exports.
   At a closed meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the United States was also criticized for refusing to accept
a ruling against U.S. patent law, but won praise for agreeing to
ease restrictions on imports of sugar, a GATT official said on
condition of anonymity.
   At the meeting the European Economic Community and Norway both
accepted GATT rulings that they should allow freer access to imports
of fruit, the official said.
   The GATT council meeting also received a formal bid for
membership from Venezuela, the only sizable Latin American country
not in the 96-nation trade group, and heard an announcement by
Austria that it would slash import taxes on nearly 2,000 products,
the official said.
   Brazilian ambassador Rubens Ricupero told the closed session that
the U.S. threat to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on some
Brazilian goods ``places under threat the entire Brazilian export
sector,'' according to a text of his speech released to journalists.
   Indian delegate Bal Krishan Zutshi said it would be ``extremely
difficult'' to yield to U.S. demands for direct talks about the
trade barriers under ``threat of unilateral retaliation.''
   A U.S. deputy trade representative, Rufus Yerxa, told the meeting
U.S. action was justified and added the Bush administration was
prepared to pursue its grievances within the GATT multilateral
system of rules, according to the GATT official who was present at
the meeting.
   Under a controversial section of its 1988 trade act, the United
States last month announced priority action against Brazil for
import quotas, against India for restrictions on foreign investment
and against Japan for refusing to buy U.S. superconductors and
satellites.
   It has said the three countries must agree to negotiations and
remove the offending barriers within 18 months or face retaliatory
tariffs.
   More than 20 countries have criticized U.S. policy at GATT
meetings Wednesday and Thursday, the official said.
   The United States was also criticized by several negotiators for
refusing to accept a GATT dispute panel ruling against U.S. patent
law, the official said.
   In a case raised by the EEC, the panel found that the United
States dealt more harshly with foreign products challenged with
infringing U.S. patents than with home-produced goods similarly
challenged.
   Yerxa said he saw ``no existing means of reconciling the adoption
of the report with U.S. political and commercial interests,''
according to the GATT official.
   The United States has now blocked adoption of the report at five
council meetings.
   However, Yerxa said the United States accepted the findings of a
report that its quota on sugar imports violated free trade rules and
said the Bush administration would be considering how to ease the
restrictions.
   The EEC for its part said it accepted a dispute panel ruling that
it must reform its controls on imports of dessert apples following
complaints from both the United States and Chile.
   Norway agreed to adopt a judgment that it should not restrict
imports of apples and pears into the country, the official said.
   Venezuela's application to join the GATT is significant because
it also belongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
cartel, which has the opposite aims of GATT in that it seeks to
control oil trade and prices.
   There are now 10 countries, including China, waiting to join GATT.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $4.01 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $4.01 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high
of $321.26 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the eighth straight weekly increase and the
eighth-straight record amount in fund assets, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group reported.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $2.79
billion increase in fund assets the previous week, revised down
slightly from the $2.80 billion rise originally reported.
   ``Assets in all fund categories continued to surge even though
short-term interest rates kept easing,'' said Jacob Dreyer,
institute vice president and chief economist.
   ``Past experience suggests, however, that the upward trend in
money market fund assets is likely to coninue past the short-term
interest rates peak and well into their decline,'' Dreyer said.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 231 general
purpose funds rose $780.8 million to $102.92 billion, assets of 95
broker-dealer funds increased $1.45 billion to $135.64 billion, and
assets of 142 institutional funds rose $1.79 billion to $82.70
billion.
   In another report, the seven-day average yield on money market
mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.89 percent from
8.94 percent the previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund
Report, a trade journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 9.01 percent from 9.08 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 39
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.56 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.57 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.93 the
previous week. Yields were 8.94 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.00 percent; 8.77 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.82 percent;
and 8.70 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.78 percent.

<HEAD>54-Story Denver Building For Sale For $300 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 54-story former Mountain Bell Center in
downtown Denver _ one of the largest in the city and 91 percent
occupied _ is on the sale block for $300 million, officials said.
   BetaWest Properties Inc., the real estate arm of U S West Inc.,
has hired the New York investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. to sell the six-year-old building. The building was renamed 1801
California when Mountain Bell changed its name to U S West last year.
   The Rocky Mountain News reported Thursday that real estate
officials said BetaWest's asking price, at about $250 per square
foot, is too high, and they believe the building likely would sell
for $250 million to $270 million.
   BetaWest bought the building in September 1987 from Prudential
Insurance Co. for $196 million in the largest-ever single-property
transaction in the Rocky Mountain region. About 60 percent of the
building's occupied space now is leased by U S West.
   Ray D'Ardenne, senior vice president for Equitable Real Estate
Management Inc., said Morgan Stanley earlier this year offered the
building to his firm, but the price was too high.
   He said it is not unusual for a building the size of 1801
California to be sold through a Wall Street firm.
   ``With a deal that size, you have to have access to capital
markets, and those guys have access,'' D'Ardenne said.

   The stock market pulled out of a three-session
slide Thursday, encouraged by lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 21.47 points in the
week's first three sessions, recovered 17.26 to 2,482.17.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
813 up, 626 down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.51 million
shares, up from 168.83 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 207 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged to see interest rates
decline slightly in the government securities market in spite of a

<TEXT>
   A Georgia official has asked strikebound Eastern
Airlines to think about moving its headquarters from Miami to
Atlanta, home of Eastern's chief rival, Delta Air Lines.
   Georgia Industry and Trade Commissioner George Berry said he sent
a proposal to Eastern President Phil Bakes several weeks ago, but
hasn't received a response.
   ``I'm sure there would be all kinds of options for them to
consider if they showed an interest'' in moving to Atlanta, Berry
said.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., has
done little to refute speculation recently that the airline may move.
   ``There's a good physical facility here,'' he said earlier this
week. ``Miami is important to Eastern.''
   Lorenzo did not rule out a move, however, saying, ``We're going
to have to see what makes sense as we go along.''
   Atlanta was Eastern's first operations base and has long been its
largest flight hub. It is at the forefront of Eastern's proposed
plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell around $1.8 billion in
assets to pay debts.
   The plan calls for the Atlanta hub to be fully rebuilt to more
than 300 daily flights. Atlanta would be the center of operations
for the airline, which would be about 65 percent of its pre-strike
size.
   Before the strike that started March 4, about 6,700 of Eastern's
30,000 employees were based in Atlanta.
   The walkout by the Machinists union, joined by pilots and flight
attendants, nearly grounded Eastern and forced it to seek bankruptcy
protection from creditors on March 9.

   The winners of a national competition
designed to introduce high school students to supercomputers were
announced Thursday by the Cornell National Supercomputing Facility
at Cornell University.
   The winning teams in the 1989 Superquest competition were Clear
Lake High School of Houston; Illinois Mathematics and Science
Academy, Aurora, Ill., Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring,
Md.; and North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham,
N.C., said CNSF Director Lawrence Lee.
   The winners will conduct supercomputer studies of airplane wings,
eye surgery, traffic lights, black holes, robots, medical X-rays,
brain-like computers, colliding galaxies, advanced maps, concert
halls and island ecology, among other things, Lee said.
   The winners will receive about $200,000 in workstations and
equipment from International Business Machines Corp., which along
with the National Science Foundation sponsors the one-of-a-kind
competition.
   The winners also will attend a 2{-week, expense-paid training
course at the Cornell supercomputing center in July. The winning
teams of a teacher-coach and three or four students will return to
their schools to carry out their projects but will continue to have
access to Cornell's supercomputer, one of five in the nation.
   The winning teams will deliver presentations on their projects to
an audience of scientists and engineers at Cornell on July 21.
   Supercomputers are powerful computers able to handle billions of
bits of information simultaneously. The Cornell supercomputer
facility provides supercomputing to more than 1,900 researchers at
more than 100 universities around the nation.
   The proposed projects range from the fanciful to the
mind-bending. Emily Meng-pae Wu of City High in Iowa City, Iowa, won
individual recognition for her proposal to study the biomechanics of
basketball shooting.
   Christopher Alan Adler of Thomas Jefferson High School for

<HEAD>Hanson Trust Bids $4.8 Billion For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC made a $4.8
billion buyout offer Thursday for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC,
going after the mining giant that two months ago escaped a hostile
takeover attempt by another suitor.
   Gold Fields quickly advised shareholders not to accept the bid
but indicated it was willing to talk with Hanson, which owns
businesses operations ranging from brewing to brickmaking in Britain
and the United States.
   Hanson offered 14.30 pounds a share, about $22.29 at current
exchange rates, for Gold Fields, one of the world's biggest gold
mining companies and owner of a 49.3 percent stake in Newmont Mining
Corp., the biggest U.S. gold miner.
   Hanson also said it had agreed to acquire the 29.9 percent stake
in Gold Fields held by Minorco SA, the investment group that failed
in a $5.46 billion hostile takeover attempt of the company.
   Gold Fields shares jumped 1.70 pounds, about $2.63, to 14.23
pounds a share, about $22.05, on the London Stock Exchange following
news of the offer.
   Lord Hanson, chairman of the conglomerate, called the offer a
``full and fair price.''
   But Rudolph Agnew, chairman and chief executive of Gold Fields,
advised his stockholders not to sell yet, saying the offer
undervalued the company's assets. However, Agnew also said he would
meet with Hanson ``to impress upon him the true worth of Gold
Fields,'' an indication he might seek a sweetened bid.
   Gold Fields shares had fallen after a U.S. court in April refused
to lift an injunction blocking on antitrust grounds the takeover
attempt by Minorco, which is controlled by South Africa's powerful
Oppenheimer mining family.
   Minorco had argued it would sell Gold Fields' stakes in Newmont
and a number of other major mining operations if its takeover
succeeded, but the court sided with government concerns that the
acquisition of Gold Fields sizable holdings could lessen competition
in gold and strategic metals markets.
   Minorco had received acceptances of its offer from about 25
percent of Gold Fields' shareholders which, combined with the 29.9
percent it already owned, would have given Minorco control of Gold
Fields.
   ``Unlike Minorco, Hanson is a serious company and any approach
from it has to be carefully considered,'' said Agnew. ``However,
Hanson's opening offer completely fails to reflect the value of Gold
Fields. It would benefit Hanson's shareholders but it does not
sufficiently benefit ours.''
   Minorco Chief Executive Michael Edwardes said his company viewed
the sale of its Gold Fields shares to Hanson as ``a very
satisfactory outcome.'' Minorco would receive 915.2 million pounds,
$1.43 billion, from the sale of its 64 million shares.
   Hanson is involved in tobacco, bricks, electricals, cement, tools
and other basic industries and made pretax profits last year of
$1.37 billion. In the United States its subsidiaries include Kidde
Inc., the diversified manufacturer; Smith Corona Inc., the
typewriter maker; Durkee Foods Corp.; Hygrade Food Products Corp.;
and SCM Chemicals Inc.
   Gold Fields, besides its mining interests, manufactures a range
of products that analysts say complement many Hanson business lines,
with little overlap.
   Robert Haville, an analyst at brokerage Morgan Stanley
International in London, said Hanson's bid for Gold Fields was ``a
reasonably pitched, intelligent offer.''
   Gold Fields shareholders would find Hanson's cash offer far more
appealing than the cash-and-share proposal Minorco made.
   ``Institutions will consider it very attractive indeed,'' said
Haville.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. partners of the accounting giants Arthur
Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney have voted overwhelmingly in favor
of a previously-announced proposal to merge the firms, it was
announced Thursday.
   The merger plan, which will be submitted to partnerships abroad
over the next few months, would create the world's largest
professional services firm, to be known as Ernst &amp; Young.
   The new firm, which will be based in New York, is expected to
begin merged operations by Oct. 1.
   A spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young said partners in each firm voted
separately on the merger and that about 99 percent favored the
combination.
   Top executives of the companies said in proposing the merger May
19 that it would enhance each firms' professional capabilities and
provide better service to clients. It will provide accounting and
auditing, tax, management and informations systems consulting.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney, based in Cleveland, is the fourth-largest
accounting and consulting firm in the world while New York-based
Arthur Young ranks fifth in terms of revenue, the firms said.
   The new firm would have revenue of $4.3 billion, putting it ahead
of the current world leader, KPMG Peat Marwick, with revenue of $3.9
billion.
   The combined U.S. firm would be the largest single firm within
the new multinational operation. It would account for 25,000 of the
new concern's 70,000 employees, 2,105 of its 6,100 worldwide
partners and $2 billion of its $4.3 billion in worldwide revenue.
   In the United States, Ernst &amp; Young will be led by co-chief
executives, Arthur Young Chairman William L. Gladstone and Ernst &amp;
Whinney Chairman Ray J. Groves. Its co-chairmen will be William A.
Grant and Jesse M. Miles of Arthur Young and Robert J. Kelly and
Robert D. Neary of Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   The U.S. approval was the first in a series of votes expected by
partnerships of the two firms over the next few months. But the
merger of the U.S. operations can proceed regardless of how other
partnerships vote.

<HEAD>Dollar Hit by Rumor and Lack of Buying Interest; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar sank against major foreign currencies
Thursday in a slide deepened by a rumor, quickly denied by the White
House, that President Bush had been shot.
   The dollar managed to recover some lost ground after the White
House denial. Currency dealers said the rumor circulated in foreign
exchange markets for 45 minutes to an hour.
   But a lack of buying interest in the dollar plus dollar sales by
central banks to prop up the sagging British pound contributed to a
generally weak day for the dollar, dealers said.
   William Mikus, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., said
the Bush rumor ``probably pushed the dollar through 140 yen,
triggering a lot of stop-loss sales,'' which were aimed at limiting
losses by unloading dollars in case the currency declined further.
   Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New York
office, said trading was thin and choppy with the market on guard
for possible central bank intervention.
   A report by a Washington-based consulting group that Japan, the
United States and West Germany were determined to bring the dollar
lower by selling the American currency has been denied by central
banks but has left traders extra wary, Morrissey said.
   The British pound was hammered during the day by reports of more
railway strikes following Wednesday's 24-hour shutdown of the
national rail network over a pay claim.
   The pound recovered a bit in European trading when the Bank of
England, Britain's central bank, intervened in the market by buying
pounds to hold up the exchange rate. Late Thursday in London, one
British pound cost $1.5525, more expensive for buyers than late
Wednesday's $1.54675.
   Sterling was weighed down by renewed selling later in New York.
The Federal Reserve, possibly acting on behalf of the Bank of
England, was believed to have sold dollars and bought pounds,
currency dealers said.
   A pound was quoted at $1.5585 late in New York compared to
$1.5553 Wednesday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 141.40 Japanese yen from
144.95 late Wednesday. In London late Thursday the dollar was
trading higher at 140.90 yen, but it slid to 139.30 yen later in New
York, down from 142.55.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.9515 West German marks, down from 1.9610; 1.6820
Swiss francs, down from 1.6905; 1.19135 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19325; 6.6215 French francs, down from 6.6565; and 1,417.75
Italian lire, down from 1,423.50.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with levels late
Wednesday were: 1.9590 West German marks, down from 1.9680; 1.6860
Swiss francs, down from 1.7005; 6.6325 French francs, down from
6.6795; 2.2005 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2375; 1,418.50 Italian
lire, down from 1.439.50; and, 1.1925 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19675.
   Gold prices pulled back slightly in the United States after
rising on markets abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a bid of $370.25 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, down $1
from Wednesday's late bid.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $371 a troy ounce, down $1.40 from Wednesday's
settlement price.
   Gold bullion closed at a bid of $369.75 a troy ounce in London,
the major European market, up from $366.75 late Wednesday. The
closing price in Zurich was $370.60 bid, up from $366.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $370.35, up from
$365.95.
   Silver bullion prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.292 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $5.285. Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of
$5.34 a troy ounce, up from $5.28.

<HEAD>Signs Of Soviet Buying Send Sugar Futures To 11-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of sugar purchases by the Soviet Union whipped the sugar
futures market into a bullish frenzy Thursday, with prices reaching
an 11-month high on speculation that the surprise transactions
implied further buying down the road.
   On other markets, corn and soybean futures wilted as rain arrived
in Iowa; coffee futures rallied; and energy, precious-metals and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Sugar futures settled .50 cent to .94 cent higher on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery in
July at $1.399 a pound, the market's highest level since July 25.
   The rally was fueled by trade reports that the Soviets had bought
2 cargoes of refined white sugar and one cargo of raw sugar on the
open market. One cargo equals 10,000 to 12,000 metric tons.
   The Soviet Union usually does its sugar buying in the fall and
winter, and had stated repeatedly earlier this year that it
completed its sugar buying for all of 1989.
   ``A lot of people in the business view this as the tip of the
proverbial iceberg, meaning the Soviets will come in and do even
more shopping,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst who follows the
sugar, coffee and cocoa markets for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Analysts predicted new Soviet purchases would total at least
100,000 metric tons and could run as high as 300,000 metric tons.
   Some speculated the Soviets were forced to enter the world market
because of slow shipments from Poland or because the Russian
sugar-beet crop was smaller than expected.
   Or they may simply have observed the market's sharp upward move
over the past several weeks and decided to lay in supplies before
prices go higher.
   ``They look at supply-and-demand figures as much as everyone
else,'' said analyst Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York.
   Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade as showers drenched some of the driest croplands in Iowa.
   Rainfall amounts varied widely in the western Corn Belt, but one
report of a four-inch dousing in western Iowa apparently convinced
traders that the severely dry conditions there were finally easing.
   Wheat settled { cent to 3{ cents lower with July at $3.98} a
bushel; corn was 4{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at
$2.62\ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6{ cents lower with July at
$1.57 a bushel; soybeans were 14 cents to 22\ cents lower with July
at $7.23{ a bushel.
   Coffee futures rallied strongly on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on buying supported by indications of tight near-term
supplies and by the International Coffee Organization's announcement
of a 1.5-million-bag cut in export quotas of high-quality mild
arabica coffees. A bag of coffee equals 60 kilograms or about 132
pounds.
   The export cut was triggered by a drop in coffee prices.
   Coffee settled 1 cent to 2.72 cents higher with July at $1.1899 a
pound.
   Unleaded gasoline futures climbed sharply on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following an Energy Department report that
refuted Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute report showing a
substantial rise in U.S. stocks of gasoline. The rally spilled over
to the crude-oil and heating-oil markets.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 10
cents higher with August at $19.30 a barrel; heating oil was .64
cent to 1.02 cents higher with July at 48.62 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .56 cent to 1.89 cents higher with July at
60.99 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures set back a bit on New York's Commodity Exchange
following the strong gains of the previous session. Silver inched up.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.60 higher with August at $374.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.7 cent higher with July at $5.303 a
troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished little changed in listless
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .33 cent lower with August at 69.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent higher with
August at 81.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .13
cent higher with July at 49.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .05 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at 33.67 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   A representative of the major oil companies on
Thursday attacked President Bush's clean-air proposal involving
methanol-powered cars, saying it could add to public health risks
without significantly improving air quality.
   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,
told a House panel the oil industry was unhappy with Bush's proposal
for requiring the use of cars powered by methanol to reduce certain
smog-causing pollutants.
   ``Methanol fuel use is unlikely to result in significant air
quality improvements, raises serious public health concerns because
of methanol's high toxicity, and will not enhance national energy
security significantly,'' DiBona said.
   The oil industry produces about 110 billion gallons of gasoline a
year. It currently does not have the capacity to produce large
quantities of alternative fuels.
   Bush said his proposals, announced June 12 as part of a broad
package of measures aimed at making the air cleaner, would combat
smog in urban areas by reducing emissions of carbon monoxide, while
also limiting toxic pollutants such as benzene. It would require
that 500,000 alternative-fuel cars be built by 1995.
   DiBona told a subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and
Urban Affairs Committee that consumers will pay more per mile for
methanol than gasoline, will need to fill up more frequently because
methanol burns less efficiently, and may have more problems starting
their cars in cold weather because methanol needs more heat to start
burning.
   ``Under a methanol mandate, consumers would have to bear these
costs and yet not receive a significant overall improvement in air
quality,'' DiBona said.
   DiBona also said limited domestic supplies of natural gas _ the
cheapest source for methanol _ meant Bush's proposal could undermine
national security. This is because the extra supplies of natural gas
would come, at least in part, from the Middle East, thus adding to
American dependence on an unstable region, he said.
   DiBona also criticized Bush's proposals for reducing gasoline's
volatility, or its ability to evaporate into the atmosphere, and for
requiring gasoline pump controls aimed at reducing the amount of
vapors escaping into the air.

   Energy futures prices finished mostly higher
Thursday, led by gasoline futures after a government report showed a
drop in gasoline supplies, contradicting an earlier industry figure.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, slipped a
penny to close at $19.30 a barrel, after gaining 43 cents on
Wednesday. Other crude contracts closed narrowly higher.
   Among refined products, the July contract for unleaded gasoline
rose 1.89 cents to close at 60.99 cents a gallon, after a 0.7 cent
decline on Wednesday. August unleaded gasoline gained 1.61 cents to
58.30 cents a gallon and September closed at 55.79 cents, up 1.43
cents.
   Heating oil also advanced, with the July contract settling 0.64
cent higher at 48.62 cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery later in
the year posted higher gains.
   Traders said crude prices started out strong amid news of an oil
production slowdown in the North Sea due to pipeline problems.
   But the market's attention turned to gasoline futures after a
Department of Energy report showed that gasoline inventories
declined last week. The report contradicted an American Petroleum
Institute report released on Tuesday showing a rise in gasoline
inventories.
   Gasoline futures prices dipped on Wednesday after the API, which
represents major oil producers and refiners, reported that gasoline
stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels to 221.1 million barrels last
week despite an increase in demand as the summer driving season
picks up.
   But the DOE report released late Wednesday showed that total
gasoline supplies were down 1.3 million barrels to 218.7 million
barrels.
   ``The new numbers were surprising because usually the two reports
are pretty close,'' said Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``It was a factor that affected prices.''
   Both reports showed a decline in crude and heating oil
inventories for the week and a drop of some 30 million barrels in
total oil supplies, including crude and products, from last year.

   The New Directions dissident movement in
the United Auto Workers union, stung by defeats here, will expand
its scope and hold a convention this fall, the group's leader said
Thursday.
   Jerry Tucker, who on Wednesday lost a re-election bid to the
union's 21-member International Executive Board, said a steering
committee would be formed to guide the movement's efforts.
   He also said a convention would be held this fall at a time and
place yet to be set and that a limited organizing effort, calling
for $30-a-year membership fee, would be expanded nationwide.
   However, Tucker said the New Directions had no immediate plans to
form a formal dissident group within the UAW, such as the Teamsters
for a Democratic Union did within the Teamsters in 1976. The TDU and
New Directions share some goals, such as increasing individual
member participation in union affairs, and have the same attorney,
Chip Yablonski of Washington.
   ``It's an accelerating and a broadening of what's been going
on,'' Tucker said after the New Directions forces held a caucus at a
hotel near the convention.
   Roy Wyse, who defeated Tucker in an election for director of
Region 5, said Wednesday that his election was the ``beginning of
the end for New Directions.''
   But, Tucker countered Thursday, ``I think Brother Wyse will soon
find that New Directions is accelerating ...''
   New Directions has suffered a defeat on the convention floor
every day since the UAW's triennial constitutional convention opened
Sunday. It made challenges to delegation members being seated, then
a resolution calling for direct election of top national officers
and a move to restrict joint labor-management programs on plant
floors.
   All those efforts failed. But Tucker and his backers remained
optimistic about the future of their organization and its effect on
UAW administration.
   ``They know they have to deal with us for the next three years,''
said New Directions member Ed Tweed of Local 596 in Lake Orion,
Mich. ``We know they will go in (to factories) and pay more
attention in each local. If they do that we have to get the credit
for it.''

<HEAD>Pickers Turn Backs on Strawberries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Oregon's strawberry harvest is in
slow motion as pickers leave the fields for the more lucrative
cherry crop east of the Cascade Range.
   ``We could use 1,500 people, but the berries are turning soft,
and it's getting late,'' said Sue Brewer, agricultural field
representative for the state Employment Division in Hillsboro.
   ``The crop is only half of usual, and we don't even have enough
pickers for that,'' Brewer said Wednesday of the situation in
Washington County.
   Growers had worried earlier that too few pickers would arrive
from Mexico and elsewhere this year because of confusion over the
new immigration law. Plenty of pickers showed up, but many are
leaving mid-harvest.
   In East Multnomah County, grower John Sester waited anxiously for
labor for a third picking of his 30 acres of berries. ``The first
two pickings pay our expenses. It's the third picking that puts us
into the profit side,'' Sester said.
   ``We've been in pretty good shape up to this point. We have about
70 percent of our crop picked,'' he said.
   At the nearby Scenic Fruit Co. packing plant in Gresham, owner
Dean Bredenkamp watched his new quick-freeze line idled for lack of
berries. The plant usually employs 350 people on two shifts during
the seasonal peak, but only one shift was working four or five hours.
   Randy McAllister, administrative assistant at Oregon Cherry
Growers in The Dalles, said he was not surprised by the exodus of
pickers from berry fields to the cherry orchards.
   ``We have a big, beautiful crop to pick for two or three weeks,
and the growers up in the Yakima Valley do, too. I think we're doing
OK on supply of pickers,'' McAllister said.
   Besides the lure of higher earnings for workers, ``we have some
awfully nice housing. We've spent money on it for 20 years,'' he
said. The 7,000 acres of orchards in Wasco County have some of the
largest concentrations of cherry farms in the world, McAllister
pointed out.
   Brewer said workers found the first picking of Washington County
strawberries worthwhile earlier this month. But the unusual winter
kill of plants resulted in poor yields in many of the second and
third pickings, discouraging pickers, she explained.
   Some of the foreign workers who qualified for work permits under
immigration law reform have abandoned all types of farms, leaving a
smaller labor pool, she added.
   ``People who got work permits want to get into factories or
something else with benefits and stability. You can't blame them,''
she said.
   Immigration law allows farmers to recruit foreigners without work
permits, but there are many restrictions and a 60-day lead time.

<HEAD>Newmont Mining Selling Half Of Peabody Holding Co. Inc.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newmont Mining Corp. announced Thursday it has
signed a definitive agreement to sell 50.03 percent of Peabody
Holding Co. Inc. to Salomon Brothers and Shearson Lehman Hutton for
$75 million cash.
   The agreement is part of the Denver-based gold company's
previously announced plan to recapitalize Peabody, a major coal firm.
   The sale, expected to occur in the third quarter of this year,
will be complete when Peabody has redeemed shares held by others for
a total redemption price of $575 million and has paid a $425 million
dividend to Newmont.
   The agreement gives Newmont the option to reacquire the 50.03
percent interest from Salomon and Shearson after four years, and it
allows Newmont to name a majority of the Peabody board.
   Newmont, which will retain a 49.97 percent interest in Peabody,
will use its $500 million in aggregate proceeds from the Peabody
recapitalization and sale to reduce its debt, said Gordon R. Parker,
Newmont chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Parker said Peabody will refinance most of its own existing
indebtedness as part of the recapitalization.
   Besides its interest in Peabody, Newmont also owns 90 percent of
Newmont Gold Co. and 75 percent of Newmont Australia Ltd.
   Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold miner, is 49.3 percent owned by
Britain's Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. On Thursday British
conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC made a $4.8 billion buyout offer for
Gold Fields. The developments were not directly related.

   The United Steelworkers union said it reached a
tentative four-year contract settlement Thursday with Inland Steel
Co. that raises wages in each of the first three years, improves
pensions and avoids any worker concessions.
   ``We're going to recommend it, and it does meet all the goals our
members helped formulate. I think they'll accept it,'' said Jack
Parton, director of USW District 31 and chief negotiator with the
nation's fourth-largest steel producer.
   Inland originally wanted concessions, including the right to
schedule workers for a 12-hour work day, Parton said. The company
also wanted the employees to help pay medical insurance premiums.
Both demands were withdrawn by company negotiators.
   Incentive pay will be increased in the fourth year, and the
agreement also improves pension benefits and resolves differences
over the status of maintenance jobs, he said.
   Inland's workers gave no wage concessions in the 1986
negotiations, so there was no restoration of past sacrifices.
   The talks began March 7, earliest among four major producers who
shared July 31 contract expirations. By a self-imposed settlement
deadline of March 31, Inland still was demanding concessions and had
offered no wage increase, Parton said.
   ``We hadn't had a raise in about eight years, when inflation was
22 percent. The company made a big buck. Management got raises. They
deserve raises, but so do we,'' Parton said.
   By late May ``we still couldn't convince our counterparts that
our members were entitled to share in those profits,'' he said. ``We
started preparing for a strike.''
   The 12,000 USW members at Inland were hearing late in the
bargaining that a sticking point remained over wage increases in the
first year, and their fellow union members at National Steel Corp.
this week surprised negotiators by rejecting a 50-month offer in
part because it offered less money up front than workers accepted
from Bethlehem Steel Corp.
   The Inland settlement came around 4 a.m. in Chicago, where the
company is based.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilot Flew with Broken Foot, Paper Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into a charge that
an Eastern Airlines pilot with a broken foot and two newly hired
co-pilots flew into a difficult South American airport, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   Eastern union sources said the captain, Ron Neville, suffered a
broken foot in a car accident June 15 on his way to the airport in
Asuncion, Paraguay. Despite the injury, Neville continued flying
even though a broken foot could make him unqualified for duty, the
sources told The Post of West Palm Beach, Fla., for an article
published Thursday.
   One stop on the flight was in La Paz, Bolivia, an airport
Eastern's operations manual designates as one at which only the
captain can make takeoffs and landings. The airport is in the
mountains, and nearby terrain rises 8,000 feet above the airport.
   Flying an airliner with such an injury is dangerous because foot
pedals help steer the plane and heavy pressure is required in some
wind conditions or if an engine fails, the union sources said.
   Eastern officials said the claim was an effort by its striking
unions to hurt the airline by raising doubts about its safety.
   ``This type of manufactured, alleged incident is typical of the
safety-related scare tactics that (the pilots union) is using at
this point,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.
   Matell said Neville didn't feel he had been incapacitated after
the auto accident. After returning to Miami, the captain was checked
out by Eastern's medical department and his private physician and
was cleared to continue flying with a hairline fracture in his foot,
Matell said.
   ``This is not the type of thing you would even put a cast on,''
Matell said.
   Neville, a resident of Davie, near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has an
unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment.
   ``The (pilots union) called it to our attention last weekend, and
we're looking into it,'' said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta.
   The medical report is being sent to the FAA but has not yet
arrived, Barker said.
   Besides the captain, the cockpit crew reportedly included two
recent graduates of Eastern's pilot training program.
   Pilots union spokesman Hank Weber called La Paz ``the most
dangerous'' airport in Eastern's system because of the mountains. He
also said Eastern has scaled back training aimed at helping new
pilots handle South American flights because of its need to train
them quickly.
   Eastern suffered a fatal crash into a Bolivian mountainside five
years ago.
   The union has charged that the company, moving ahead with a
rebuilding plan relying mainly on newly hired pilots, is risking
safety by using so many inexperienced pilots.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in mid-June but a narrower money measure fell, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $4.8 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,084.8 billion in the week ended June 12 from
$3,080.0 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $7.5 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,970.8 billion from $3,963.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, slipped $6.6
billion to a seasonally adjusted $769.5 billion from $776.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,078.0 billion, a 1.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,957.0 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1 fell
4.5 percent to an average of $778.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said bank borrowings from
the Federal Reserve System at the discount window, excluding
extended credit, averaged $546 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $471 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.9 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$289.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>World Coffee Export Quota Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Coffee Organization on Thursday
slashed the quota for exports after a sharp fall in world prices.
   The association of producers and consumers, which regulates the
$10 billion annual world trade in coffee beans, cut 1.53 million
bags, reducing the global allocation for the current year to 55.34
million bags.
   ``No further cut is possible,'' a statement said.
   One bag contains 60 kilos or 132 pounds.
   Most of the reduction will be borne by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
El Salvador and the other producers of the prized arabica type of
bean, most of them Latin American.
   The cut became inevitable when the price of coffee fell below the
organization's $1.30-a-pound indicator price for arabica coffee.
   The organization of 74 countries tries to keep the average price
of the two basic coffee types, arabica and robusta, within a band of
$1.10 to $1.40 a pound by balancing supply with demand through quota
adjustments at fixed prices.
   Despite previous quota reductions that affected only robusta
producers, the average price of both types last week dropped below
$1.10 a pound.
   Robusta coffee is the poorer and less popular type produced
throughout most of Africa and in Indonesia.

<HEAD>Pizza Chain Says No Drivers Under 18</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc., under fire for a
series of fatal traffic accidents involving delivery people, plans
to stop hiring employees under 18 although current workers can stay,
a spokesman said Thursday.
   The decision came after Florida parents complained about layoffs
following an earlier directive to re-assign or fire drivers under 18.
   But Domino's will recommend that its stores not hire people under
18 for driving or non-driving jobs in the future, spokesman Ron
Hingst said.
   The earlier move led to confusion when at least one Domino's
outlet in Miami gave pink slips to all employees under 18 on
Wednesday.
   Domino's Florida division gave instructions to discharge all
workers under 18, but modified them later Wednesday after parents
complained to the company's regional office in Pompano Beach, Hingst
said.
   ``Some of our people jumped the gun,'' he said. ``There was some
miscommunication on our part.''
   Hingst said it was Domino's policy to comply with federal law
prohibiting the hiring of drivers younger than 18. In some cases,
however, people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering
pizzas, he said.
   Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatalities in the last year in
accidents involving its drivers, but denies the company's
29-year-old promise to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a
telephone order encourages employees' reckless driving.
   Federal child labor laws forbid hiring people under 18 for
several hazardous occupations, including drivers. The law doesn't
rule out occasional driving for younger workers, however.
   Domino's re-examined its hiring practices after June 3, when
deliveryman Jesse Colson, 17, died in a one-vehicle accident in
Indianapolis.
   His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's
guarantee was ``an invitation to break the law.''
   But Hingst said the hiring directive was ``a reminder to follow
the guidelines. We decided to have everybody review their employees
on individual basis.''
   The U.S. Labor Department examined the Indianapolis accident and
would have directed regional officials to talk to Domino's if a
wider problem was suspected, said a department spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
   The department's assistant district director for Michigan,
Valeria Sobecki, said she hadn't been told to take up the question
with Domino's.
   Hingst said Domino's has talked with the Labor Department about
driver age requirements before. ``We had all our paperwork in
order,'' he said.
   The review will affect about 300 employees at company-owned
Domino's stores who are under 18, he said. Company-owned stores
comprise about one-third of Domino's 5,000 stores nationwide.
   The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises. Hingst
said franchise owners were being urged to make the same move.
   ``It is highly recommended to the franchises, but it isn't
contractually binding,'' he said.
   Domino's company-owned stores and franchises combined have about
150,000 employees, including 70,000 to 80,000 delivery drivers,
Hingst said.

<TEXT>
   Canadian real estate giant Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. confirmed Thursday it has made a bid for Sears
Tower, after the Wall Street Journal reported the company was among
four finalists vying for the world's tallest building.
   Three other parties named by the newspaper as finalists for
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s 110-story building said they could not
comment on the report.
   The bids are said to range from $800 million to $1 billion, which
would be the highest price paid for an American building, the Wall
Street Journal said, citing ``individuals familiar with the
process.'' However, the bids are probably below Sears' expectations,
a source told the newspaper.
   ``We have submitted a bid,'' said Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman in
New York for Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York, the largest private
commercial real estate developer in North America. He would not
disclose the size of the bid and declined further comment.
   The three other bidders named by the Journal are Chicago pension
manager JMB Realty Corp. with developer Trammell Crow Co. of Dallas;
Chicago developer LaSalle Partners Inc. with Prudential Insurance
Co. of America; and Boston pension adviser Aldrich, Eastman &amp; Waltch
Inc.
   LaSalle Partners Vice President Gretchen Needham said her firm
``looks at every significant real estate opportunity in the
country'' but would not confirm a bid for Sears Tower.
   All the other companies named in the Journal story referred
telephone calls to senior executives or corporate spokespersons, all
of whom were said to be unavailable and did not return calls.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the Journal did not get
its information from Sears.
   ``We're not commenting on the process of the sale. It's been
going on for a while and we expect it will go on for a while,'' he
said. ``When we have a deal we'll announce it.''
   Even the lowest of the reported bids would top the highest price
ever paid for a U.S. building, $660 million paid by Walter
Shorenstein in 1985 for the Bank of America building in San
Francisco.
   But all the reported bids are below the $1.2 billion to $2
billion that real-estate experts expected the building would fetch
when Sears announced last October it would sell the downtown Chicago
landmark as part of a corporate restructuring.
   The Japanese government has discouraged Japanese bids on Sears
Tower, fearing an anti-Japan backlash if they were to be successful
in acquiring such a prominent piece of America, said John Oharenko,
a managing partner in the Chicago office of Cushman &amp; Wakefield
Inc., a New York real estate firm that has represented Japanese
buyers in other property deals.
   The Sears Tower sale has been overshadowed lately by the
company's plan to move its 6,000-employee merchandise group out of
the tower to a location that the company expects to announce within
a week.
   Illinois hopes to retain the retail arm of Sears, but several
states, including North Carolina and Texas, also are in the running.
   The merchandise group occupies most of the 50 lower floors of the
tower. The problem of finding tenants for those floors, which are
considered less desirable than the upper levels, is one of the
factors holding down the price tag for the building, Oharenko said.

<TEXT>
   A 3 percent raise for United Auto Workers
union President Owen Bieber and the union's other top officers was
approved Thursday by delegates to the union's constitutional
convention.
   The raise, retroactive to June 1, boosted Bieber's annual salary
as head of the 1 million-member union to $91,469.42.
   Bieber and the other officers also will receive quarterly
cost-of-living adjustments and 3 percent lump-sum payments on June
1, 1990 and on the same day in 1991. For Bieber, each lump-sum
payment works out to at least $2,744.08.
   The formula of a 3 percent raise, COLA adjustments and lump-sum
payments for the union's 21 top officers is the same as that
negotiated for UAW members in 1987 at General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. Last year, the UAW negotiated a contract with Chrysler
Corp. calling for two 3 percent lump sum payments that brought wages
for all Big Three workers into balance.
   UAW Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens' salary went to
$83,078.35 with two annual lump-sum payments of at least $2,492.35.
   Salaries for vice presidents Stephen Yokich, Ernie Lofton, Stan
Marshall and Odessa Kommer rose to $79,800.56 a year, plus two
annual payments of at least $2,394.02. Pay for the union's 15
regional directors rose to $71,409.48 with lump sum payments of at
least $2,142.28.
   The salary increases came as delegates to the convention, which
concludes Friday, approved a report from the constitution committee.

   Valley National Corp. of Phoenix announced
Thursday it will add $181 million to its loan-loss reserves and
expects a $90 million loss in the second quarter as a result.
   Valley National Bank of Arizona and Valley Utah Bancorporation
are chief subsidiaries.
   Valley National Chairman James P. Simmons attributed the action
to a deterioration in Arizona's real estate market with no immediate
sign of recovery.
   ``Given that current market conditions make the estimation
process difficult, we believe we have taken a conservative view in
determining the amount to be added to our reserves,'' Simmons said.
   Banks take such steps to protect themselves against the
possibility that loans won't be repaid. The weak property market in
the economically depressed Southwest has raised the risk of mortgage
defaults.
   Valley National stressed that the corporation's core earnings and
financial base remain strong. It projected that a substantial amount
of the second quarter loss should be regained by the end of the 1989.
