   A man who fled the shooting of his wife
crashed his car, took over two other vehicles at gunpoint and left
an abducted family beside a New York highway before surrendering
Friday, police said.
   Victor Otero, 39, was wanted for the Thursday night shooting of
his estranged wife, Evelyn Diaz Otero, 34. She was in critical
condition Friday night at St. Joseph's Medical Center, said a
nursing superviser.
   Otero turned himself in to Paterson police about 5 p.m. Friday
and was arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, armed
robbery and unlawful possession of a weapon, said police Sgt. Craig
Perrone.
   Otero was held in the city jail pending arraignment Saturday.
   Police said the shooting began an interstate trek across the
Hudson River and a manhunt that involved police from Paterson, New
York City and Nassau County.
   Otero shot his wife several times about 10:15 p.m. Thursday and
fled in his own car only to get into an accident with other cars a
few blocks away.
   Witnesses told police Otero pulled a revolver and forced Nelson
Vazquez of Paterson to drive him to New York City. Vazquez dropped
Otero off near the New York end of the Lincoln Tunnel in Manhattan,
police said.
   There, Otero approached a car stopped at a pay phone and forced
five members of a North Carolina family to drive him to Long Island,
said Officer Janice Swinney, a New York City police spokeswoman.
   A male family member was at a pay phone when Otero allegedly
forced him back into the car and made them drive to Long Island.
   ``I thought he was going to kill us for sure,'' said Bobby Gee,
whose husband, daughter, son, and grandson were held at gunpoint
during the two-hour ordeal.
   ``We started to pray out loud as soon as he got into the car,''
Mrs. Gee said. ``He told us to shut up.''
   The gunman forced the family, which was in New York to attend a
funeral service, out of the car on the Long Island Expressway near
Old Westbury, police said. Perrone said there were no reports of
injuries to the family or Vazquez.
   Otero then fled on foot. He contacted his relatives while on the
run and was talked into giving himself up, Perrone said.

<HEAD>EPA Urges Conservation Measures for Cars, Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation techniques that were urged during
the energy shortages of the 70s should be adopted to combat global
warming caused by pollution, the EPA says.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, in a report Friday, outlined
actions such as development of fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving
homes and solar technology, needed by the end of the century to
curtail global warming. They say such warming will occur unless air
pollution is reduced.
   In its report to the Senate subcommittee on environmental
protection, the EPA said most scientists agree that without action
to reduce pollution, the Earth can be expected to warm by 4 to 11
degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years.
   ``There's no doubt there is a consensus that the greenhouse
phenomenon is very real,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the
subcommittee chairman after hearing EPA Administrator William K.
Reilly summarize the EPA report.
   Scientists believe that a variety of pollutants are causing a
``greenhouse effect'' that traps the sun's infrared radiation,
instead of allowing it to go back into space, resulting in increased
warming. The gases most responsible for the warming are carbon
dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides.
   The EPA report said ``no single technology or policy can have
significant impact in mitigating the accumulation of greenhouse
gases'' because of their wide use. Instead, it said, that only by
dealing with the problem broadly can there be significant reductions.
   The recommendations outlined in the EPA report will be used by
both the administration and Congress to assess what kinds of
regulatory action or legislation might be needed on global warming.
   One focus, the agency said, must be aimed at reducing the use of
fossil fuels, which produce carbon dioxide, by far the largest
single contributor to global warming. Last decade, the high cost of
such fuels and the easy shutoff of foreign sources prompted
conservation moves.
   To curtail energy use, the report proposed:
   _Increasing average automobile fuel economy levels to 40 miles
per gallon by the year 2000. This is in sharp contrast to the Reagan
administration, which in recent years has urged elimination of
federal fuel economy standards and accommodated auto industry
requests not to set fleetwide standards above 26.5 mpg.
   _Taking measures to make new single family homes more energy
efficient so that on average they will use 50 percent less fuel heat
in the year 2000 than the average in 1980.
   _Setting fees of 7 percent to 20 percent on carbon emissions from
natural gas, oil and coal to encourage less use of those fossil
fuels.
   The EPA also suggested increasing research into solar technology
so it competes with oil and gas and pushing to get all industrial
countries to require catalytic converters similar to those required
in U.S. automobiles.
   But the report emphasized that increased energy efficiency will
not in itself provide the total answer. It said efforts must be made
to:
   _Stop the loss of forests around the world by beginning in 1990 a
program aimed at planting at least as many trees as are cut down or
destroyed. Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, keeping the gas
from getting into the atmosphere.
   _End the use of chlorofluorocarbons by all industrialized
countries over the next 14 years and take action to sharply curtail
the chemical's use by developing countries.
   The Bush administration and the Western European countries
recently agreed to phase out use of such gases, which contribute to
depletion of the world's ozone layer and are believed to be a major
contributor to global warming.

   The National Rifle Association is denying an
accusation that it indirectly sent messages to national drug
director William J. Bennett threatening his political future.
   ``The allegations are absolutely ridiculous,'' said Wayne
LaPierre, executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative
Action.
   An administration source said Friday that the warnings to Bennett
through third parties threaten that ``if he has thoughts of a
political future, he can forget them if he doesn't respect the power
of the NRA.''
   Bennett has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for elected
office.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bennett is
``very angry at the NRA'' and that while he's ``not looking for a
fight with the NRA, he won't walk away from it'' and may battle them
in public if need be.
   Bennett said Friday through spokesman Don Hamilton: ``There have
been a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.''
   The issue arose Tuesday when, at Bennett's urging, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady immediately suspended import permits for
more than 110,000 assault-style rifles such as the semiautomatic
versions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines. Colt Industries Inc
subsequently decided on its own to suspend sales of its AR-15, the
most popular U.S.-made semiautomatic assault rifle.
   President Bush had told Bennett a week earlier to develop a
policy on the rifles. Calls for a ban have been prompted by scores
of drug-related shootings and the recent killing of five California
schoolchildren by a man wielding such a weapon.
   Publicly, the NRA has reacted calmly to the decision, saying it
would relieve the ``media hysteria'' over the guns and ``should
provide an atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this
issue.''
   But privately, the source alleged, the NRA has been relaying
warnings via ``private people'' who are not in government.
   During an interview earlier in the day, Bennett said he believed
most members of the NRA do not support an ``anything goes'' attitude
toward gun ownership and said he had spoken with friends of his who
are hunters. ``These people have no use or interest in assault
rifles,'' he said.
   ``The `anything goes' idea _ let's just get our hands on any kind
of weapon _ I think that's a view of the world that's not shared by
most Americans, by most members of the National Rifle Association,
and I think an awful lot of people out there are concerned about the
kind of firepower that we're seeing used in our streets,'' he said.
   Bennett said he was not surprised that sales of semiautomatic
assault rifles have taken off since the import suspension and Colt's
action this week, but, he said: ``If people are doing this because
they think that this could mean the end of guns, that no more guns
would be available, then they're mistaken.
   ``The tradition in this country of a law-abiding citizen having
guns, using them for lawful purposes, teaching their kids how to
hunt, target shooting, is as old as this republic itself, and it's
not something anybody wants to disturb.''
   Echoing the NRA's words, Bennett said: ``Everybody knows
ultimately the problem isn't the gun, the problem is the gun in the
wrong hands.
   ``But it seems to me reasonable measures can be found and taken
in this effort which don't deprive or interfere with that good and
decent practice of people enjoying their firearms in lawful ways and
yet respond and speak appropriately to this escalation, this arms
race in the cities that police have spoken about so eloquently.
Clearly there's a large middle ground there.''

<HEAD>Cheney Goes to Work as Defense Secretary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Wyoming congressman Dick Cheney was
sworn in as the nation's 17th secretary of defense after a unanimous
Senate endorsement that one Republican complained may have been too
swift.
   Cheney won Senate confirmation Friday on a 92-0 vote, just one
day after the Senate Armed Services Committee gave him its unanimous
blessing.
   Shortly after Friday's vote, Cheney resigned as Wyoming's sole
congressmen and then was sworn in as defense chief during a private
ceremony in his Capitol Hill office. A large, formal oath-taking
ceremony was scheduled for next Tuesday.
   Later in the afternoon Friday, Cheney traveled to his new
Pentagon office where he met with Donald Atwood, the GM executive
who has been nominated to become deputy defense secretary, and with
several Reagan administration holdovers for briefings.
   Officials said Cheney would probably work at least part of the
weekend trying to get settled in.
   Cheney's elevation to the defense post finally completed
formation of President Bush's Cabinet, a process slowed by the
bruising fight over the president's first choice for defense
secretary, former Texas Sen. John Tower.
   Tower was rejected by the Senate, 53-47, on March 9 after weeks
of controversy over his personal life, drinking habits and
consulting work for large defense contractors.
   Cheney was sworn into office by David Cooke, director of
administration and management in the office of defense secretary.
Present were his wife, Lynne, their two daughters, Elizabeth and
Mary, and his parents, Richard and Marge.
   ``I am proud to have the opportunity to serve the president of
the United States and the nation as secretary of defense,'' Cheney
said. ``But at the same time, I will miss the House. And more than
anything, I regret that I must step down after representing the
state of Wyoming for 10 years.''
   The rancor surrounding the Tower nomination was largely absent
when the Senate moved quickly this week on Cheney, although some
bitterness remained. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., complained the
Senate had ``rushed to judgment'' on Cheney after the dispute over
Tower and with a two-week recess looming.
   ``There's hardly been a chance for people to find out about
Congressman Cheney's nomination in the press, media, to sit down and
write a letter and have it delivered,'' Specter said. ``I think
we're correct and I'm prepared to vote for Congressman Cheney, but I
do think this timetable ought not set a precedent.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, top Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, denied Cheney was put on a fast track, noting
that because he was a congressman, his financial records were
already on file. In addition, Warner said, the FBI expedited its
background check.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, later responded
more pointedly, saying: ``I gather what he (Specter) wanted us to do
was to wait for the rumor and innuendo to come in.''
   Nunn led the fight to kill the Tower nomination and came under
harsh criticism for his handling of the proceedings. The Georgia
Democrat used his time on the Senate floor to defend the committee's
process.
   Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson said he and Sen. Malcom Wallop, both
Republicans, felt a mixture of pride and sadness because their
state's congressional delegation was losing a man of ``distinction
and honor and rare political savvy.''
   A special election will be held in Wyoming to fill the House seat
vacated by Cheney.
   Senators not present for the vote on Cheney were William
Armstrong, R-Colo.; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Phil
Gramm, R-Texas; John Heinz, R-Pa.; James Jeffords, R-Vt.; Terry
Sanford, D-N.C., and James McClure, R-Idaho.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Confesses To Killing Baby Brother, Resented Caring For
Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl who confessed
killing her 2-year-old half-brother and trying to kill her
15-month-old half-sister apparently resented caring for them, police
said.
   ``Apparently the mother had to work a lot of double shifts and
(the 11-year-old) was in charge of feeding the baby, clothing them,
taking care of them as an adult would and she's only 11 years old,''
said police Sgt. Rick Wierzbicki.
   ``We worked with a lot of investigators on this case, and no one
can remember a person that young committing such a crime,'' he added.
   The girl, whose name was not disclosed because of her age, was
being held at the Broward Juvenile Detention Center on one count of
first-degree murder and one of attempted first-degree murder, police
said.
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement figures show three children
younger than 10 were arrested in 1986 for murder. In 1987, one child
that age was arrested.
   The children's mother, Sally Butterfield, discovered Andrew
Caesar dead and Tiffany Caesar unconscious in their beds Tuesday
morning.
   Police said there were no signs of abuse, and tests were done to
see if the children had been poisoned.
   But after the medical examiner determined Thursday night that
Andrew had been strangled, his half-sister admitted killing the boy
and choking Tiffany and hitting her on the head, Wierzbicki said.
   Tiffany was listed in critical condition Friday at Hollywood
Memorial Hospital.
   Wierzbicki said the case will be turned over the the Broward
state attorney's office next week.

   Twenty-one senators have lined up against their
steel-state colleagues and called on President Bush to end steel
import quotas covering 19 nations and the European Community.
   The senators said in a letter Friday to Bush that the restraints
have driven up steel prices and caused product shortages. They said
the United States needed ``a sensible steel policy'' that considered
not just steelmakers, but other producers, too.
   The senators, 18 of them Republican, face stiff opposition.
Fifty-five other senators, many of them from steel-producing states,
have signed onto a bill empowering the Bush administration to extend
the import curbs beyond their Sept. 30 expiration.
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with
Japan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa, the European Community and
other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the United
States.
   Three days before last November's election, Bush pledged to
continue the restraints in some form. But with the steel industry
newly profitable, opponents of the curbs _ led by a coalition of
U.S. manufacturers _ believe they can make a case for ending the
program, or at least narrowing its scope.
   Manufacturers of home appliances, construction and farm
machinery, industrial equipment, auto parts and other products all
rely on steel as a raw material, said the letter to Bush.
   ``In the experience of many of these manufacturers, steel
voluntary restraint agreements have caused higher prices and
shortages of some steel products, and are undermining their ability
to compete in international markets,'' the letter said.
   ``It is important that steel trade be considered from the
perspective of all U.S. manufacturers, not just the steel industry
alone,'' it said. The senators invited Bush to work with Congress to
end the ``burden'' of the quotas.
   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., a leading advocate of continued
restraints, said through a spokesman Friday that the conditions that
compelled steel firms to seek government aid in 1984 remain.
   ``There are still some senators who keep their heads in the sand
when it comes to the fact that countries have not discontinued their
unfair trading practices of dumping and subsidies,'' said Richard
Bryers, legislative director for Heinz.
   Signing the letter to Bush were Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; Thad
Cochran, R-Miss.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Slade Gorton, R-Wash.;
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; Robert Kasten, R-Wis.; Herbert Kohl, D-Wis.; Trent Lott,
R-Miss.; Connie Mack, R-Fla.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bob Packwood,
R-Ore.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo.; John Warner, R-Va.; and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.

<HEAD>Bills Aiding Striking Eastern Workers Bogged Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of Eastern Airline's striking unions
are shrugging off their inability to prompt Congress to quickly
produce legislation aimed at helping the thousands of picketers.
   The two bills that the carrier's workers are pinning their hopes
on both bogged down on Friday _ at least temporarily _ as the Senate
began its two-week Easter recess.
   Union leaders said the delay would not be overly harmful to
strikers, who began their third week of picketing today. Labor
leaders said they are relying more heavily on two other strategies:
working in the bankruptcy courts, and seeking a buyer for the
grounded airline.
   ``We never indicated to any of our members that these bills were
a panacea, they would be passed quickly, or anything like that,''
William Winpisinger, president of the International Association of
Machinists, said in an interview.
   ``We told our pilots up front that things in the House would go
quickly but the Senate would be an uphill fight,'' said Henry A.
Duffy, president of The Air Line Pilots Association.
   The Eastern strike began when the airline's 8,500 machinists
walked off their jobs in a wage and benefit dispute and were
followed by the carrier's pilots and flight attendants.
   Senate Democrats scheduled a vote for April 5 _ the chamber's
second post-Easter day of business _ on whether to allow
consideration of a bill that would hand the government a role in
ending the walkout. Republicans have so far blocked action on the
measure, which would compel President Bush to name a special board
to recommend a way to end the strike.
   At the Senate Judiciary Committee, officials of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp., voiced opposition to a measure that would
up the ante for management. The bill, introduced by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, would allow Eastern's creditors access to the
assets of Texas Air, which also owns Continental Airlines. Eastern
filed for protection from its creditors under the federal bankruptcy
code on March 9.
   Texas Air's associate general counsel, Elliott M. Seiden, told
the panel that the bill would be ``unfair, oppressive and
unconstitutional'' and would have dangerous repercussions throughout
the airline industry.
   ``In the future, no corporation could or would consider acquiring
a troubled airline, or starting a new airline ... because the risk
of failing could not be confined to the new venture itself,'' Seiden
told the senators.
   Both bills are considered long shots for enactment into law.
Administration officials have threatened a veto of the emergency
board bill.
   The bankruptcy revision measure has been questioned by several
lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the
judiciary panel, who said Friday that he wants to study how the
proposal would effect other airlines.
   Union leaders and their Democratic supporters have sought action
on the bills anyway, arguing that their efforts would at the very
least be good for strikers' morale.

<HEAD>Study Says Loss of Oil Imports Would Cause no Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. energy system could handling a sudden
and sustained loss of oil imports without suffering shortages of
gasoline and other refined oil products, although prices might jump,
a government-sponsored study has concluded.
   The study by the National Petroleum Council, an advisory group to
the Energy Department, said the key to managing an import cutoff is
quick action by the government to tap into the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve's underground oil stocks.
   In the event of a loss of oil imports equal to 3 million barrels
a day _ representing about 40 percent of last year's average import
rate _ the strategic reserves in Louisiana and Texas could be used
to meet most of the shortfall, according to a draft of the study
provided Friday to The Associated Press. The study assumed the
imported oil would be cut off for three months.
   The strategic reserves currently hold about 555 million barrels
of crude oil. The system was created by Congress in 1975 in response
to the Arab oil embargo that year.
   The study made no firm predictions about price increases
resulting from a supply emergency, but John Lichtblau, a private
energy expert who helped compile the draft report, said in an
interview that prices would be expected to rise sharply even if the
oil transport system succeeded in averting shortages.
   ``The possibility of a price explosion as an instant reaction in
such a volatile situation is highly likely,'' said Lichtblau,
president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. He said it was
impossible to predict how high prices would go.
   Energy industry officials and many on Capitol Hill have voiced
increasing alarm in recent weeks at a trend toward rapidly growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Imports last year equaled 42 percent
of supply, up from 31 percent in 1985. This trend is linked to a
drop in U.S. oil output and rising consumption.
   The concern has fueled an oil industry drive to win congressional
approval to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refugee in
northern Alaska and off the shores of California and Florida, where
prospects for discoveries are considered good.
   Some energy executives also have cited the import trend as a
reason for Congress to approve an import fee on oil and for
providing new tax breaks for oil drillers.
   The study on how the nation's oil transportation system would
respond to supply emergencies was requested by John Herrington in
February 1987 while he was energy secretary. Final conclusions are
to be presented to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins in mid-April,
said Carla Byrd, a petroleum council spokeswoman.
   The draft report cites three main reasons why even a severe
disruption of oil supplies would not cause a shortage of petroleum
products: the large amounts of oil in transit on ocean tankers,
barges and in pipelines; a more flexible and efficient oil refining
and transport system; and the availability of strategic reserves.
   The study also said the energy system could cope with a shutdown
of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System for 30 days without causing
shortages of gasoline or other products. The pipeline carries oil
from the North Slope of Alaska to the port of Valdez for shipment to
the lower 48 states, Hawaii and the Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>Senators Keep PAC Money They Claim is Tainted</HEAD>

   Two Democratic senators say they'll keep $8,000
in campaign contributions from an imported-car dealers' group, even
though both complained the organization is a foreign agent forbidden
to make such payments.
   Although the Auto Dealers and Drivers Free Trade PAC gave $5,000
to Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and $3,000 to Sen. Harry Reid of
Nevada last year, it also spent nearly $1 million to defeat them and
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
   Those three senators, along with Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
signed a letter to the Justice Department asking it to investigate
whether the PAC ought to be registered as a foreign agent.
   If the organization were found to be a foreign agent operating
with foreign funds, spending that money to influence an American
election would be illegal.
   Nevertheless, neither Graham nor Reid plan to give the money back
unless the Justice Department tells them to do so, their spokesmen
said.
   ``I mean these guys are hypocrites,'' Tom Nemet, chairman of the
PAC, said Friday. ``They asked us for money to support them.''
   Nemet and Frank Glacken, the imported-auto dealer PAC's executive
director, deny they're working for foreigners.
   The PAC spent nearly $2.6 million last year on House and Senate
elections. Of that total, about 83 percent was spent to help
Republican candidates, according to figures compiled by the Federal
Election Commission.
   Nemet and Glacken said in a telephone interview from their office
in New York City that Reid, Bryan and Graham are trying to get even
because the group spent large amounts of money against them.
   Nemet and Glacken said the organization's funding comes entirely
from American citizens.
   Jean Neal, a spokeswoman for Bryan, acknowledged that Bryan was
``not thrilled'' that the PAC spent more than half a million dollars
against him. Ken Klein, a spokesman for Graham, said the Senator
would wait to see what the Justice Department decides. Craig Varoga,
spokesman for Reid, said only that the senator does not plan to give
back any money.
   Boren, who has neither been opposed by nor accepted money from
the group, signed the letter because his colleagues asked him to and
because he is opposed to the role political action committees in
general are playing in American politics, said spokesman John Deeken.
   Under federal law, individuals or firms representing foreign
governments, people or companies have to register with the Justice
Department as foreign agents and report what activities they have
carried out for their clients.
   While foreign agents could still give money to political
campaigns as individual American citizens, the law does not permit
them to make such contributions in their role as foreign agents.
   The PAC also paid out big money to help Trent Lott in
Mississippi, Connie Mack in Florida and Malcolm Wallop in Wyoming.
All three of those Republicans won their Senate elections.
   Lott had $319,126 spent on his behalf by the PAC, Mack received a

   The Pavia tower toppled, the Tower of Pisa is leaning
further than ever and dozens of other artworks have been shrouded in
scaffolding or turned over to restorers.
   Modern day damage from traffic and pollution and simple old age
are exacting a heavy toll on some of Italy's most famous monuments.
   The collapse on Friday of the 255-foot medieval tower in the
northern city of Pavia was one of the most dramatic blows to Italy's
historic patrimony since a bell tower in Venice toppled 87 years ago.
   But experts say is it symptomatic of the problems afflicting art
works in Italy.
   ``There has been inadequate regular maintenance and we have
reached the absurd, where if an (art) superintendent wants to send a
letter he's forced to pay for the stamps,'' Franco Piacenti, head of
the art section of the government's National Research Committee,
told a convention on protecting artworks in Florence Friday. He
commented after word of the Pavia collapse reached the experts.
   Two people were killed and 15 injured when the tower collapsed in
Pavia, a city founded in 568 by the Longobards, a Germanic tribe,
and later home of the Lombard rulers.
   The tower was 900 years old and possibly suffered damage from
heavy rains last August. The architect in charge of monument
preservation, however, said the cause was probably the natural decay
of the mortar cementing the bricks.
   ``It's something due to age, which cannot be predicted. It's
typical of ancient towers,'' said Maria Antonietta Abrate. ``It also
happened to the bell tower of Venice.''
   In 1902, the 1,000-year-old St. Mark's Bell Tower in Venice
toppled without warning. A worldwide subscription raised money to
build an exact reproduction, which was completed in 1912.
   Italy's most famous tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, has been
judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate future.
   The 800-year-old tower continued to increase its lean last year,
according to the annual report recently issued by the group charged
with preservation of the marble monument. But Giuseppe Toniolo, head
of the group, said he expected it to stand for as long as another
two centuries at its current rate of lean.
   ``The tower is closely watched, very closely watched,'' said
Toniolo in a telephone interview. ``Just because one tower falls
doesn't mean another will.''
   The 180-foot marble monument, begun in 1173, began to lean when
it was only 34 feet high when the soil underneath it began to give
way. Experts have been studying projects to support the tower, while
keeping its famous tilt, but no work has begun yet.
   Rome is the depository of some of the world's greatest artworks
but has also had to battle some of the biggest problems caused by
the exhaust fumes and the rumbles from the 1.8 million cars in the
Italian capital.
   Experts recently reunited Marcus Aurelius with his horse after an
8-year-long restoration project but haven't decided yet whether to
risk new damage by returning it to its place on the Campidoglio
Square.
   The Trevi Fountain sits behind plexiglass, with its waters turned
off, as it undergoes cleaning and restoration. But over the past
year, other monuments and columns have been reappearing from behind
scaffolding as restoration work is completed.

<HEAD>Chilean Fruit to Return to Market under Tougher Inspections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chilean fruit could be back in U.S. stores next
week under an intensified inspection plan designed to assure the
safety of the produce after traces of cyanide were found in two
grapes last week.
   The Bush administration cleared the way Friday for new shipments
of Chilean fruit with announcement of an inspection plan that
officials said will provide ``maximum feasible safety'' of the fruit
and end a week-long health scare.
   Under the plan, fruit held by importers, wholesalers and
retailers in the United States ``that cannot be practically
inspected'' will be destroyed, while fruit at the docks, on ships or
awaiting export in Chile will be subjected to heightened
inspections, officials said.
   ``This is a plan that deals with safety and what is maximumly
feasible,'' said Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration.
   Responsibility to see that fruit already in the United States is
destroyed lies with state health departments, Young said.
   Neither FDA nor representatives of Chilean exporters could give
figures on the value of the fruit to be destroyed.
   Young said questions about who would bear the cost of the lost
fruit are also not his to consider.
   ``I've got to look at safety, I've got to look at the scientific
data and I can't allow economics or politics to move into those
decisions,'' the FDA commissioner said.
   A third poisoning threat was telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago on Friday, sometime before the plan was announced in the
early afternoon Friday, Young said.
   Young said officials believe the caller may have been the same
Spanish-speaking man who made the two earlier threats that prompted
the inspections that found the tainted grapes. But, he said, the
latest threat raises no more or less concern than the first two.
   ``We designed this thing with (the probability of more) threats
in mind,'' he said.
   About 5 percent of Chilean fruit at U.S. docks or in transit to
the United States will be visually inspected, and all
suspicious-looking fruit will be subjected to laboratory tests
before it is released for sale.
   In Chile, fruit to be exported will be subject to increased
security, inspections and lab tests. The Chilean government and
exporters will be responsible for the program there, but an FDA team
will be sent to Chile soon to assist and observe their procedures,
Young said.
   He said the plan is ``based on the assumptions of the type of
sampling that would be required to have a high confidence of
detecting anything if something is there.''
   ``It is impossible to assure 100 percent safety,'' without
checking every piece of fruit, he said.
   Chilean grapes, which make up the bulk of grapes on sale this
time of year, and other fruit could be back on the shelves of U.S.
stores in five to nine days, he said.
   Young said grapes _ which constitute about 70 percent of Chile's
sales in the United States _ raspberries, blueberries, blackberries
and strawberries will be the first fruit released because cyanide
contamination of them is the easiest to spot since the fruit
discolors quickly and becomes mushy.
   But, he cautioned, that ``consumers should inspect all products,
regardless of country of origin.''
   He said buyers should look for needle marks, any unusual
appearance or discoloration or a chemical or `burned almond' smell.
   Young said he could not estimate the time for return of the other
Chilean fruit exports, including melons, cantaloupes, pears, apples,
nectarines, plums and peaches. These larger fruits, if injected with
cyanide, could carry higher levels of the poison than the smaller
fruits can.
   Young said the inspections of 13,000 crates of fruit since small
amounts of cyanide were found in two seedless red grapes last
weekend turned up no additional evidence of contamination.
   After the FDA plan was unveiled, the military government in
Santiago announced a package of economic measures to counter the
extensive damage to the Chilean fruit industry.
   Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, who met in
Washington Friday with Vice President Quayle, called the plan a
``workable solution.''

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says he
is sending top aides to Europe this weekend to look into the safety
of U.S. airlines and new allegations about warnings of terrorist
attack before the bombing of Flight 103.
   Skinner said Friday his action was prompted by a meeting with
relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21 disaster
over Scotland and by the controversy erupting in England over
specific threats before the bombing.
   In addition to dispatching members of his personal staff, Skinner
said he planned to visit England, France and West Germany himself
next month in an effort to get a united approach to the threat of
sky terrorism and find out more about the bombing and the warnings.
   The secretary said in a speech that his meeting with relatives of
some of the people killed in the Pan Am explosion convinced him he
must get directly involved in issues surrounding the bombing.
   Skinner said the relatives introduced themselves one by one,
using the names of loved ones killed in the crash.
   ``It was one of the most moving meetings I think I have ever had
... You were literally speechless,'' he said.
   Bert Ammerman, a victim's relative who attended the meeting,
praised Skinner for meeting with about 20 families but said he is
angry that the government has done so little to prevent further
terrorist attacks or warn passengers.
   He said neither former President Reagan nor President Bush has
sent even a note of condolence to any of the families, while at
least two U.S. victims' families received sympathy notes from
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``If we'd won the Super Bowl, we'd have been in the Rose Garden.
But if you get people blown out of the air, that's not important
enough,'' said Ammerman, whose brother was killed in the bombing.
   A group of Flight 103 victims' relatives proposes that the
government set up a telephone number passengers can call to see if
there are threats against a flight they are planning to take.
   Officials in England disclosed that a bomb warning, including a
photograph of a radio-cassette bomb of the type investigators
believe was used, was dated two days before the Pan Am 747 was
destroyed but did not reach the airlines until several days later.
   Both British authorities and the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration had described such a bomb in security warnings a
month earlier, airline and government officials said. The West
German intelligence agency said it sent a memo about the possibility
of such a bomb to U.S. airlines even earlier, on Nov. 10.
   Skinner said he was trying to get more details on the warning and
how they were handled.
   ``Let me tell you I don't know everything,'' he said. ``Yesterday
I learned some things for the first time, and I think the FAA did,
about some disclosures in West Germany as well as some possible
disclosures to United Kingdom airlines.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of a Senate
transportation subcommittee, introduced a resolution urging Bush to
appoint a commission to investigate the bombing.
   ``The FAA specifically warned that the explosive device might
evade detection by X-ray machines,'' Lautenberg said in a Senate
speech. ``We need to know what Pan Am and other airlines did, if
anything, in response to these warnings.''
   Lautenberg attempted to get floor passage of his resolution, but
Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader, said it
should go through the committee hearing process first.

<HEAD>Barry Says ACLU ``Out of Touch'' in Curfew Opposition</HEAD>

   A lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union
challenging an emergency curfew for teen-agers in the nation's
capital shows the organization has lost touch with the reality of
drugs and violence, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. says.
   Barry commented Friday after the local ACLU chapter asked a
federal court to declare the District of Columbia's 90-day law
unconstitutional and issue an injunction blocking enforcement.
   Backers say the law is intended to help fight drugs in the
nation's capital by keeping people under 18 off city streets late at
night and early in the morning and thus away from the often violent
open-air drug markets.
   The class-action suit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of
the parents of five teen-agers, a 12-year-old boy and three other
people, says the curfew violates constitutional protection of
freedom of speech and association. The law also is flawed because it
forces young adults to carry adequate identification and display it
to police on request, and discriminates ``irrationally'' between
people under and over age 18.
   But Barry countered: ``The ACLU lawyers don't live in these
neighborhoods where you can't sleep at night because gunshots,
killings are going on. They don't live in communities where drugs
are being used or sold. They're out of touch with reality.''
   The emergency law went into effect Thursday. Enforcement will
start on Monday, the mayor said. The measure generally requires
people under age 18 to be off the streets by 11 p.m. during the week
and by midnight on weekends. The curfew ends daily at 6 a.m.
   The suit said one of the plaintiffs is a 17-year-old girl, Simbi
Waters, an actress attending art school who would need to be out
after midnight if she gets the part in a play for which she is now
auditioning.
   Another plaintiff, 17-year-old David Dranitzke, is a student
council president who attends senior class dinners at night about
twice a month and who says the senior prom this spring will last
well past midnight.

<HEAD>Commissioner Rebuked Over Visit to Indian Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission demanded Friday
that its chairman apologize for his actions on an Indian reservation
in Arizona last month, according to a published report.
   The chairman, William B. Allen, went to the White Mountain Apache
Reservation on Feb. 7 to look into a custody dispute involving a
14-year-old girl. Allen, a psychologist and a television crew
interviewed the girl, outraging tribal authorities who called the
incident an invasion of sovereignty.
   The New York Times reported in its Saturday editions that the
commission rebuked Allen during a closed meeting Friday, and ordered
him to write letters of apology to all involved.
   One member of the commission who attended the meeting said Allen
acknowledged he had exercised bad judgment, The Times reported.
   Allen has said he went to the reservation because he wanted
first-hand knowledge of whether the girl, Lalita Altaha, had had a
chance to express her own wishes in the custody dispute.
   The girl was adopted as an infant by a white couple, Nadine and
Normand Desrochers, but last year a court ordered that she be
returned to her natural mother, Thurza Altaha, who lives on the
White Mountain reservation.
   According to The Times' account, Allen learned of the case from
psychologist Barry Goodfield, who is a consultant to the commission
and who also had advised the Desrochers family. Allen told the
commission he went to the reservation with Goodfield, two U.S.
marshals and a camera crew which was making a documentary on Indian
adoption cases.
   Allen told the commissioners that they approached a school bus on
which Lalita was riding and asked for her, and that she agreed to
speak with them. They spoke with the girl for about 30 minutes, then
drove her in Goodfield's car to her home, where they had a ``tense''
exchange with Mrs. Altaha, Allen said.
   As Allen, Goodfield and the others were driving away from the
reservation, they were stopped by Gila County sheriff's deputies at
the request of tribal police and deteined for questioning. They were
released four or five hours later, said Sheriff Joe Rodriguez.
   Tribal chairman Reno Johnson later called the incident ``an
incursion that ... clearly violates the sovereignity'' of the tribe.
   At the commission's meeting Friday, Allen defended his actions as
an attempt to determine how tribal courts handle custody cases. The
commission then went into private session and demanded he write
letters of apology indicating that his activities were not approved
by the commission or condoned by its members, The Times reported.

   Actor Roger Moore, who is pulling out of Andrew
Lloyd Webber's new musical ``Aspects of Love,'' will be replaced by
his understudy for the part.
   Kevin Colson, an Australian who recently starred in the musical
``Chess,'' will take over Moore's role and the show will open as
planned April 12 at the Prince of Wales theater, said a spokesman
for the production.
   Colson had been scheduled to take over the Moore part _ the
dashing George Dillingham _ in October. The part of Dillingham is
the third-largest in the musical after those of two young romantic
leads.
   But Moore, 61, who's probably most famous for his James Bond role
in the movies, said earlier this week he was having ``terrible
nightmares'' about it and felt he lacked musical expertise.
   His departure came six weeks into rehearsals for the show, which
is sold out through December.
   Lloyd Webber's most recent musical was ``Phantom of the Opera.''

   Actor Bernie Kopell, who played wise and
winsome ``Doc'' Bricker on ABC's ``The Love Boat,'' suffered minor
injuries in a hit-and-run freeway crash.
   Kopell, 55, and his wife were heading east on Interstate 10,
about 25 miles west of Palm Springs, when their car tangled with
another vehicle, California Highway Patrol Officer J. Welch said.
   Kopell's car struck the center divider and flipped. The other car
kept going, she said.
   The actor was taken to Desert Hospital in Palm Springs where he
was treated and released, a spokeswoman said. Kopell's wife refused
treatment at the crash site, Ms. Welch said.
   Kopell started his acting career with a two-line part in the
movie ``The Oregon Trail.'' In 1963, he was signed for the role of
Siegfried in ``Get Smart.'' He became Marlo Thomas' neighbor on
``That Girl'' and spent three years on ``The Doris Day Show.''
   In 1977, Kopell caught ``The Love Boat'' for a television cruise
that lasted about a decade.

   Patrick J. Kennedy, who followed family
tradition by entering politics, did it again with a St. Patrick's
Day speech to Rhode Island's Friendly Sons of St. Patrick dinner.
   Kennedy, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy's 21-year-old son who
won a seat in the Rhode Island House last year, invoked his ancestry
in both joking and serious ways Friday.
   He reminded the crowd that his great-grandfather, the legendary
Boston Mayor John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald, had addressed them
in 1910 and that his uncle, John F. Kennedy, then a Massachusetts
senator, had done so in 1959.
   ``So some of you have probably heard this speech before. Perhaps
even twice before,'' Kennedy said.
   Kennedy said that by starting his own career in politics he hoped
to rededicate his generation to the ideals of his uncle and
great-grandfather.
   He said he is ``tired of hearing that my generation is the `me'
generation. I do not accept that serving others is out of fashion,
or that the problems confronting the government are too great.''

   Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the 80-year-old
filmmaker who won four Academy Awards by 1950, is disillusioned with
today's Hollywood.
   ``And I know _ and I'm very sad _ that American film has become,
in my opinion, the major motivation for the American being as
detested as he is throughout the world,'' Mankiewicz said.
   ``All they see in American movies is variations on obscenity,
boozing and (sex),'' Mankiewicz told reporters Wednesday.
   On Thursday, Mankiewicz received the 1989 Akira Kurosawa Award
for Lifetime Achievement from the San Francisco International Film
Festival. He was the fourth recipient, and the first American.
   Mankiewicz produced ``The Philadelphia Story'' and ``Woman of the

screenplay _ in 1949 for ``A Letter To Three Wives.'' In 1950, he
won the same two Oscars for ``All About Eve.''

   A Washington businessman who had been asked by
Marilyn Quayle to design renovations for the vice presidential
residence was arrested on felony charges of misrepresenting himself
as a certified architect.
   Charles Scott Hughes, 36, was charged after he allegedly
fabricated the architect's seal on blueprints for renovation of
restrooms in Arlington County, Va., parks, said county police
detective William Cowell.
   Police said Hughes, who was arrested Tuesday, was not a licensed
architect but that he allegedly had fake District of Columbia and
Maryland architect's seals.
   Hughes, owner of Charles Scott Hughes and Associated Architects,
refused to comment on Friday, according to The Washington Post. His
attorney, Amy Berman, told the Post she would not comment on Hughes'
arrest or his business dealings.
   Hughes has not yet entered a plea in court.
   David Beckwith, a spokesman for Vice President Dan Quayle, said
Hughes and a former employee met with Quayle twice in the weeks
before Quayle moved into the official vice president's residence.
   Hughes toured the mansion and later submitted applications for
the $200,000 remodeling plan, said Beckwith. But he was never paid
the $5,000 fee he was due after submitting blueprints and plans
because the Secret Service found ``problems'' in his security
application and seized the plans.

   Brian Wilson, Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr and
Belinda Carlisle have joined a dozen rock stars in recording a song
to benefit the world's rain forests, organizers said.
   The song ``Spirit of the Forest'' is to be released in May and
proceeds from its sales will go to rain forest preservation groups,
said a statement Friday from K.A. Publicity of London.
   ``A palpable sense of urgency surrounds the `Spirit of the
Forest' campaign,'' said the statement.
   ``As Third World nations like Brazil continue to burn, harvest
and plow under the forests for short-term human and corporate gain,
the Earth faces increasing danger from global greenhouse warming and
desertification,'' it said.
   The global warming trend called the ``greenhouse effect'' is
thought to be caused in part by a surfeit of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere. Rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
   The statement said the song was originally written by an
environmentalist English band, Gentlemen Without Weapons, for a
fund-raising gala last autumn organized by Friends of the Earth, U.K.
   Two recording sessions _ in Los Angeles and in London _ have been
completed and three others _ in New York, Rio de Janeiro and in an
Amazon rain forest _ are scheduled in April, the statement said.
   Joining Wilson of the Beach Boys, ex-Beatle Starr, Ms. Carlisle
and Ms. Mitchell will be Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, David
Gilmour of Pink Floyd, Was Not Was and Thomas Dolby.
   As well, Amazon Indians from the Tukano tribe, North American
Indians from the United States, and Japanese and Soviet musicians
would join in the singing. It did not name the Japanese or Soviet

costly treatment, virtually assuring that the program will expire
March 31.
   A bill sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., sought to

   But three senators objected to Kennedy's request on Friday that
the measure be acted on without debate or consideration of

are Models 9100 and 9101 manufactured from 1985 to 1989.
   The company discovered the foam seat pad used in the two models
burns faster than federal standards permit, NHTSA said. Since the
pad cover does meet standards, motorists should continue to use the
seats until they get replacement pads, and should not return them to
stores, the agency said.
   Owners of the affected seats may call a Fisher-Price hotline,
800-334-5439, for instructions.

   The Senate has confirmed President Bush's
selection of Lawrence Eagleburger for deputy secretary of state.
   Bush's nomination of Eagleburger for the No. 2 post at the State
Department was approved by voice vote on Friday shortly after the
senators confirmed Dick Cheney for secretary of defense.
   The choice of Eagleburger had been approved a day earlier by the
Foreign Relations Committee, 19-0. That tally even included the vote
of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who spent two days questioning the
nominee's business relations with former Secretary of State Henry

   The Agriculture Department is imposing a
federal quarantine affecting 19 states and other areas to help stop
the spread of tiny parasitic mites that threaten the honeybee
industry.
   Officials said the proposed quarantine would also be effective in
the District of Columbia and 15 U.S. territories or other
possessions known or believed to be infested with the Varroa mite.
   ``We are proposing to quarantine all `states' where Varroa mites
are known to occur,'' Al Strating, acting administrator of the
department's Animal and Health Inspection Service, said Friday.
   States listed in the proposal, which was announced on Thursday,
include: Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.
   Other areas include: American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland

   The Enola Gay, the steel-gray bomber that
effectively ended World War II, today sits in a warehouse without
wings or engines, belying its fame as the B-29 that carried the
first atomic weapon.
   Restoration experts are taking the plane apart bolt by bolt in a
nine-year project to turn the grimy aircraft into a shiny relic for
the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum.
   When the plane is displayed in 1994, the exhibit likely will
renew debate about America's use of the atomic bomb.
   It was early in the morning on Aug. 6, 1945, when the first
atomic bomb was released over Hiroshima, Japan, killing and injuring
160,000 people. A second bomb was later dropped over Nagasaki.
   ``Any time you even bring up the name Enola Gay it rekindles
debate,'' said Theodore Van Kirk, a navigator on the historic
mission. ``I guess the discussion is always going to be around. It's
been 40 some years and there still isn't any conclusion.''
   Van Kirk, now 68, saw the plane in 1985 when rehabilitation work
began at the Smithsonian's Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration
and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, just outside Washington. He
retired three years ago from DuPont and lives in Novato, Calif.
   The Enola Gay's 98-foot-long body sits severed in half at the
warehouse. The two pieces sit side by side with various other
historical planes and spacecraft.
   ``We have some (visitors) who tell us that this plane saved their
life or their uncle's life because it ended the war,'' shop foreman
Richard Horigan said recently.
   It took nearly three years for Horigan and Dave Peterson to
restore the front section. Earlier this year, technicians began work
on the rear section and wings of the plane, which Cmdr. Paul W.
Tibbets named after his mother.
   Each part is dipped, sprayed or painted with preservatives and
waxes, Horigan said.
   Using photographs, old technical manuals and history books as
their guides, the restoration experts plan to remove all markings
and decals that were not on the plane the day after the mission. The
names and dates of scores of unknown people will be buffed from the
plane's aluminum exterior.
   ``There's lots of graffiti,'' Horigan said. ``Most of it was `Joe
Blow 1950' _ that kind of thing.''
   Tibbets' name will be repainted in stenciled military lettering
instead of the script-style print added sometime after the flight.
   ``Enola Gay'' was painted in black, block letters under a cockpit
window just hours before the mission. The name will remain, but
extra brush strokes on the ``E'' and ``G,'' from a touch-up paint
job done later, will be removed, Horigan said.
   During the restoration work, Horigan and Peterson found a chisel
that had been lost inside the plane when it was being manufactured.
   They also found an atomic bomb arming pin behind the radio
operator's table. The pin apparently was an extra not used on the
weapon. A replica of the Hiroshima bomb sits in front of the plane.
   ``There's no evidence of the blast whatsoever (on the plane),''
Horigan said. ``I think they were 10 to 15 miles away when the blast
went off.''
   After the war, in November 1945, the plane was modified. It
returned to the United States in 1946 and went into storage for
three years in Arizona, then was ferried by Tibbets to Park Ridge,
Ill., a storage site for the Smithsonian.
   It made its last flight Dec. 2, 1953, when it was flown to
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.

   Customs officials today seized

Westheimer, saying they may be pornographic.
   Customs Department spokesman Robin Dare said the copies of
``Guide To Sex'' were being held in Auckland until the Indecent

   Dr. Westheimer, host of a U.S. television show and frequent guest
on radio programs, is due to visit New Zealand next week to promote
the book, which has sold well in neighboring Australia.
   Known more commonly as ``Dr. Ruth,'' she was stunned by the
seizure of the book, said her publicity manager, Jacqui Dimes said.
   ``She is a really nice person and really cares about what she
does,'' Ms. Dimes said, adding that the book is ``far from being
pornographic.''
   She said publicity about the seizure would help sales if the book
is approved.
   It was not known when the tribunal would make a decision.

   Reginald Fennell and his fuzzy companion sat in the front row at
St. John Arena Friday, flanked by 1,269 other graduates.
   ``Today I feel like a little kid,'' said Fennell, an associate
professor of health education at Miami University of Ohio as well as
a doctoral candidate. Fennell said he never tells anybody his age.
   He said he carries the bear with him when he teaches.
   ``My philosophy is to show people how to have a good time without

   Fennell credited his former professors with teaching him the
importance of combining education with levity.

   He left the bear on the seat, however, when he went to the podium

   When police got a call that an
otter had been sighted on First Street, they were surprised to find
just how weaselly the critter could be.
   Officer Tom Pomeroy and two other officers quickly cornered the
furry, bucktoothed animal near City Hall Thursday night and began
trying to herd it toward the police garage.
   But the 3-foot-long, 25-pound otter had a mind of its own.
   ``He saw the fountain (at City Hall) and was in it in no time,''
Pomeroy said.
   That's when the Police Department called David Brimm, a wildlife
officer with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   Brimm and Pomeroy took off their shoes and splashed around in the
fountain until they caught the otter.
   ``They're actually very playful animals,'' Brimm said, ``but they
have good-sized teeth.''
   The officers put the otter in the Police Department's pet carrier
and Brimm took it to the Intracoastal Waterway and set it free.

   The parents of five people killed when
a bomb exploded aboard a Pan Am flight over Scotland are demanding
that the U.S. government investigate the bombing.
   ``There is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the way
we've been treated by this country's government,'' said Barbara
Primeau of Greenwich, N.Y., mother of 20-year-old twins, Jason and
Eric Coker, who were among the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21
crash of Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Ms. Primeau joined two families of victims from upstate New York
and another family from North Adams at a news conference on Friday.
   The petition drive was launched in this northwest Massachusetts
city because residents have shown concern at the slow progress of
the crash investigation, the families said.
   ``Terrorism and tragedy such as this have never touched this
community before,'' said Mayor John Barrett III, the first to sign
the petition.
   The drive was organized by Joyce Wrend, who was among the 1,000
mourners at the church service for Wendy Lincoln, a Syracuse
University student on her way home from London for Christmas when
the plane blew up.
   ``I'd like to see an outcry from the people so loud that the
government can't forget this,'' said Charles Lincoln in his first
statement since the death of his 23-year-old daughter.
   The petitions will be distributed throughout the Northeast.
Organizers said they hope to get 20,000 signatures by the time they
stage a vigil outside the White House on April 3.
   Ms. Primeau and other family members said they suspect the State
Department knew about the bomb threats but that it remained on the
sidelines before and after the crash.
   ``We're not an investigatory agency,'' Francis Jones, spokeswoman
for the State Department's Office of Consular Affairs in Washington,
said Friday. ``British authorities are investigating the crash and
the FBI is assisting them.''
   ``The investigation is a very lengthy, complicated process. And
it's frustrating, which is very difficult for the families. It's
understandable,'' she added. ``I wish there was something we could
do to make things come together more quickly.''
   Ms. Primeau said the anger of the families was heightened Friday
by a British newspaper report that authorities knew who had bombed
the flight. The report from the Times of London, dismissed by
investigators, has increased their suspicion that the U.S.
government is withholding information about the bombing, she said.
   Pan Am confirmed it had been warned by the West German government
Nov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette player bomb involved.
   Politicians of the opposition Labor Party in London accused
Transport Secretary Paul Channon with bungling a warning dated two
days before the disaster but not mailed until several days later.

<TEXT>
   Yale University Press has sold its
one-millionth copy of its all-time bestseller, Eugene O'Neill's
``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' the publisher announced.
   Written in 1940, O'Neill's masterpiece was first performed on
Broadway and published by Yale in 1956, three years after the
playwright's death. It was O'Neill's fourth play to win a Pulitzer
Prize.
   The first paperback version of the work appeared in 1962.
   Sale of the millionth copy of the play, which happened last
month, came shortly after the conclusion of the 1988 centennial
celebration of O'Neill's birth.
   This fall, Yale University Press will publish a corrected version
of the play restoring previously missing lines of dialogue and stage
direction.
   Recent scholarship on the play uncovered several errors of
omission that occurred when the playwright's wife, Carlotta O'Neill,
retyped a heavily edited version of his manuscript.
   The changes in the 61st reprinting are ``meaningful, if not
plentiful,'' said Martha Schutz, a Yale press publicist.

   Nearly 2 million people cheered the first woman grand marshal of
the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York City, while in Connecticut
the ``Ladies of the Knights'' protested their exclusion from an
all-male affair.
   The wearin' of the green was prevalent throughout the country as
the Chicago River, the Empire State Building and the palms,
fountains and grits in Savannah, Ga., all shone with the color of
the day.
   The celebrations in honor of Ireland's patron saint continued
today, with parades in Los Angeles and Syracuse, N.Y.
   ``We've got to stop meeting like this,'' Dorothy Hayden Cudahy
told New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch as she kissed him before
taking the historic first step that kicked off the nation's oldest
and largest parade.
   ``I'm the grand marshal and I'm walking on air,'' said Mrs.
Cudahy, 66. She was followed by regiments of police and firefighters
in tam-o'-shanters and marching bands in busbies playing bagpipes,
fifes and drums.
   In New Haven, Conn., four members of the National Organization
for Women staged a satirical protest outside the annual all-male
dinner held by the Knights of St. Patrick.
   Wearing horn-rimmed glasses and outdated clothes, the women waved
handkerchiefs and yelled ``Oh Boys, Boys'' in mock high-pitched
voices as they acted as a tongue-in-cheek welcoming committee for
the Knights, who said the traditional event was just an evening of
camaraderie.
   An estimated 400,000 people lined the downtown Chicago parade
route in a light rain that began shortly after the march began.
Forty thousand marchers and more than 200 floats and marching units
moved down Dearborn Street.
   ``I say I'm Irish,'' said Daniel McQuinn, 25, of Chicago, whose
parents came from Ireland. ``If a cat had a kitten in an oven, would
you call them biscuits? I was born here, but I still say I'm Irish.''
   In Savannah, police estimated 300,000 people watched 265 units
participating in the nation's second-largest St. Patrick's
celebration. The city's 165th parade also honors Irish immigrants
who entered the United States through the East Coast port.
   Los Angeles' Irish had a choice today of two parades: the sixth
annual downtown St. Patrick's Day Parade or the fourth annual St.
Patrick's Day Parade in Hollywood.
   Boston delays its official wearing of the green until Sunday.
Other cities saving their St. Patrick's Day observances until Sunday
included Bayonne and Newark, N.J.; and Buffalo, N.Y.
   At a Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral that preceded the New York
parade, Cardinal John O'Connor preached a politically charged sermon
chiding the United States for a lack of concern ``with the problems
of Northern Ireland because we believe the Irish love to fight, that
they're a violent people.'' He added the belief the Irish desire
violence was a fallacy in need of correction.
   In Washington, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan and a bipartisan group of
senators and congressmen issued their ``ninth annual friends of
Ireland'' statement calling for peace, justice, fair employment and
an end to discrimination in Northern Ireland.
   President Bush, sporting a green tie, met in the White House with
Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and called on Americans in a
St. Patrick's Day statement to support ``all those who seek justice
and peaceful settlements to disputes in Northern Ireland.''

<DATELINE>SANTA MARTA, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   None of the voting-age residents
in this village of 2,500 plans to cast a ballot in Sunday's
presidential election.
   ``No one here believes in this election,'' said Rodrigo Lainez, a
local leader of this town, which was repopulated in 1987 after being
abandoned for seven years.
   ``This election is to prolong the war,'' said a man who
identified himself only as Victor. His comment echoed a refrain
broadcast daily on two clandestine guerrilla radio stations of the
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   No love is lost between Santa Marta and the U.S.-backed
government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. His administration and
its army consider the town, like others revived by people who
returned from refugee camps in Honduras, as hostile territory.
   Santa Marta's sympathies clearly lie with the FMLN, the rebel
army waging a nine-year war against the government. The rebels have
called for an election boycott to prove that a political solution is
impossible without their participation.
   Every day from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., battery-powered radios in Santa
Marta are tuned to Radio Farabundo Marti and Radio Venceremos. Like
many rural communities in El Salvador, this one lacks electricity.
   Women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before
heading to the fields. On one morning this week, all listened to a
radio account of overnight attacks on ``the puppet army'' and
admonishments that every Salvadoran do his part to prepare for
insurrection.
   Guerrillas wander through this town in north central El Salvador.
They are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice.
   Government soldiers, on their rare appearances, are shunned.
   ``The soldiers three times set fire to the cornfield around
here,'' said Lainez. ``The last time they came through, a few went
up to people and told them, `Just wait until Arena is in power.
We'll be back with a bomb for every house.'''
   Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, is expected to win Sunday's election. In its
campaign, Arena has taken a hard line on the war, threatening a
military solution.
   Col. Jose Herrarte, the provincial military commander, said in an
interview that he hopes to improve relations with Santa Marta
through more personal contact. But he acknowledges the difficulties.
   ``The subversives count on them for supplies, recruitment and
rest,'' he said. ``They portray us only as murderers, violators of
human rights, ogres.''
   An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans _ mostly from Chalatenango,
Cabanas and Morazan provinces _ were driven from their homes by the
war, aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s. Since
October 1987, about 6,500 have returned to rebuild their lives.
   ``When we came back, this was just woods and brush,'' said
Lainez. ``Every house had been burned, and the fields were
overgrown.''
   He said most residents never lost hope of going home. ``Our
umbilical cords are buried here,'' he said, using a Salvadoran
expression conveying the importance of one's roots.
   For their part, the guerrillas refer to the local residents as
``the heroic resettlers of Santa Marta.''
   ``They came back to confront the army without weapons,'' said a
local guerrilla commander who identified himself only as Antolin.
   During its first year of reconstruction, the town depended on
charity from the International Red Cross, the United Nations and
church groups. But last year yielded a good harvest, and the village
is nearly self-sufficient in corn and beans, the daily staples.
   A walk through the settlement showed residents building latrines,
making adobe blocks, working on a chicken coop and pounding dried
stalks of millet to separate the kernels from the chaff. Many are
enlarging their homes of adobe, mud-and-wattle and corrugated metal
roofs.
   The social arrangement is largely cooperative, with familes
permitted small private plots to augment their communal ration.
   ``Because of the war, there are lots of widows and orphans
here,'' said Lainez. ``If we weren't a cooperative, those people
would die.''
   He said soldiers in the provincial capital of Sensuntepeque often
stop trucks headed for Santa Marta loaded with donated food,
clothing or construction materials.
   ``They think everything we bring up here is for the guerrillas.
But we barely have enough for ourselves and aren't in a position to
give things away,'' Lainez said.

   Passengers aboard a Continental Airlines
jetliner sat in stunned silence when a fire on the plane's tail
created severe vibrations so severe the pilot made an emergency
landing. No one was injured.
   The Boeing 737 en route from Oakland, Calif., to Denver with 69
people aboard landed safely Friday at San Francisco International
Airport, officials said.
   The vibrations, which began over the Sierra Nevada about 200
miles east of San Francisco, lasted several minutes and were
followed by several minutes of silence on the airliner.
   ``There was no panic as far as people screaming. It's just that
people were quite concerned,'' said R.E. ``Griff'' Greffenius, a
business traveler from Walnut Creek, Calif.
   Officials discovered a charred area about 10 feet in diameter at
the rear of the tail. There also appeared to be damage to the
stabilizer, the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control
the plane's altitude.
   An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board's
Los Angeles office examined the plane Friday night, and two more
investigators were to arrive today, said Ron Schleede, chief of the
Aviation Accident Division of the safety board.
   Continental officials in Houston said they believed the plane's
auxiliary power unit, or APU, overheated. An aviation source who had
a chance to inspect the plane said a fire had damaged the stabilizer
on the tail section near the APU, but he said the power unit itself
was not charred.
   ``It (the stabilizer) is burned on the outside. The paint is
burned off. But they don't know how it occurred,'' said the source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a possibile cause could
have had something to do with one of the plane's strobe lights.
   David Messing, a spokesman for Continental in Houston, said there
was no indication of sabotage on the twin-engine jet, which carried
64 passengers and a crew of five.

   A plan to clean up the worst air in the
country by restricting everything from industry smokestacks to
household aerosols has set the stage for a political battle royal in
Southern California.
   The plan, approved Friday by two regional authorities, is
intended to bring air quality in the four-county Los Angeles basin
up to federal clean air standards by 2007.
   The debate over the plan is being followed by smoggy cities
across the country, as well as Congress, which is preparing to renew
the Clean Air Act.
   By 1994, Southern California officials plan to have phased in 120
rules in a detailed attack against pollutants arising from nearly
every type of combustion _ from patio barbecues to coal-fired power
plants.
   Eventually, the plan will require Southern Californians to drive
cars powered by methanol, compressed gas or electricity; mow their
lawns with electric lawnmowers and use reformulated paints, solvents
and aerosols.
   ``The magnitude of the planning effort is without parallel
anywhere in the country for a region of this size,'' said Mark
Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Association of
Governments.
   The air quality plan was adopted by the association on a 16-1
vote, and by the South Coast Air Quality Management District board
of directors by a 10-2 vote.
   The votes capped a contentious, eight-hour session that drew
hundreds of people from environmental and citizens' groups, industry
and government.
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who sits as a
member of both boards, vowed to seek a referendum, which he
contended would stifle economic growth.
   Union leaders also opposed tight restrictions on industrial
pollutants, which they said could close factories and cost of
thousands of jobs.
   ``They're talking about doing without gasoline,'' said an
indignant Jack Foley, west coast director of the Oil, Chemical &amp;
Atomic Workers International Union.
   An industry study by National Economic Research Associates, Inc.
concluded the plan would cost $12.8 billion a year, a figure that
contrasts sharply with the district's estimate of $3.9 billion
annually.
   Altogether, the plan proposes 160 rules to be enforced over the
next 18 years, reaching into unexpected corners of everyday life to
attack smog sources both large and small:
   _The suburban backyard scene would change forever with bans on
charcoal lighter fluid for barbecues and requirements that lawn
mowers and other tools run on either electricity or fuel that burns
more cleanly than gasoline.
   _The number of drive-through burger stands might be limited to
cut down on smog-generating engine idling while motorists wait for
their orders.
   _State-required checks of auto pollution-control equipment would
be more stringent, and new emission limits would be imposed on
diesel trucks and buses.
   The plan would cover a district of 13,350 square miles, covering
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and part of San Bernardino counties.

<HEAD>Government, Guerrillas To Begin Peace Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and the country's most
feared guerrilla group have signed an accord to begin talks toward
ending nearly two decades of bloody insurgency.
   President Virgilio Barco in a nationwide television address
Friday night asked the other Colombian rebel groups to follow suit.
   ``I urge all guerrillas to integrate themselves in civilian life.
The road is always open,'' Barco said.
   An estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas operate in Colombia. They
are blamed for more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings in
1988 alone.
   The accord was signed Friday in the mountain town of Santo
Domingo, 180 miles south of Bogota, by the minister of interior,
Raul Orejuela Bueno, and Carlos Pizarro, commander of the M-19, or
the April 19 Movement.
   The April 19 Movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential
election that the guerrillas say was fraudulent.
   Once the nation's most notorious group, M-19's bloodiest
operation was seizing the Supreme Court building in Bogota in 1985.
The army retook the building, but 11 Supreme Court justices and 85
other people were killed.
   A joint declaration said four meetings that led to the accord
were held in Colombia and Mexico after the leftist guerrillas
declared a unilateral cease-fire eight months ago.
   The declaration said both sides agreed on talks beginning April 1
that would ``lead to full democracy'' and reintegrate the insurgents
into society.
   The talks are to finish before legislative elections set for
March 1990, in which M-19 probably will participate as a legal
political party, officials said.
   The agreement did not say when the guerrillas would have to give
up their arms.
   Barco said the accord ``opens a time of hope for the fate of the
country,'' but he said there large obstacles to overcome before
attaining peace.
   He signaled that the government is ready to begin talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a communist rebel group that
declared a unilateral cease-fire Feb. 28 in an effort to join the
peace process.
   However, Barco said the cease-fire must hold for a certain period
of time to determine if the FARC has ``a genuine spirit of
reconciliation.''
   The joint declaration also said the guerrillas will no longer
operate underground and will base themselves in Santo Domingo, where
they receive state protection and will not be subject to harassment
by the army.
   During the signing ceremony, Orejuela said all sides must stay
vigilant because ``there are people interested in seeing that a
process like this one fails.''
   The declaration said 13 guerrilla delegates who had no criminal
record participated in the talks and had government protection.

<HEAD>Plans Canceled For Cable Car Up China's Great Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Beijing has halted plans to build a
cable car up the side of the Great Wall, yielding to
preservationists who said it would desecrate China's most famous
landmark, official newspapers said today.
   The battle over the cable car had been fought for two years, with
the main support coming from the Chinese builder and an army unit
stationed near the Great Wall that was to supply engineers for the
project.
   The China Daily newspaper said Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong listened
to both sides at a meeting this month before deciding. He convened
the meeting after opponents publicly accused his office of pushing
the project through in violation of a 1988 law protecting cultural
relics.
   The cable car was to have been built at Badaling, about 43 miles
north of Beijing, where for a few dollars tourists can walk along a
small restored section of the Great Wall.
   Under the cultural relics law, no construction is allowed within
600 feet of the wall at Badaling.
   The Great Wall, a dramatic symbol of China's historic fear of
foreign contact, actually began as a series of short walls built by
independent kingdoms and principalities to keep out invaders.
Efforts to build one unified wall began about 200 B.C. under China's
first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi.
   The completed wall finally stretched 3,700 miles from the desert
plains of north-central China to the sea. Large portions are now in
ruins.
   The Badaling Tourism Service Co. and Golden Glory International
Co. of Hong Kong signed a contract to build the cable car a year
before the cultural relics law was passed. Golden Glory agreed to
invest $5 million in the project, with a $1.5 million guarantee if
it was canceled, the China Daily said.
   China Youth News said more than 20 architects and officials from
the Beijing and national cultural relics bureaus led the battle
against the cable car. They even took the rare step of writing a
letter to Premier Li Peng.
   Several engineers concluded after a study that the project would
lose money.
   Officials who backed the cable car said it would ease crowding on
the wall and thereby prevent damage. Thousands of people visit the
wall each day during the tourism season, from about April to October.
   Tourists currently reach the top via one central set of stairs,
then can walk along the wall in both directions for several hundred
feet. The wall is about 30 feet high at Badaling.

<HEAD>Japan Lifts Sanctions On Chilean Grapes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Fruit-Cyanide, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan today lifted a four-day suspension on
importing Chilean grapes after Chile pledged to step up safety
precautions as a result of a cyanide scare, Japanese officials said.
   The Japanese government ordered the suspension Tuesday after
traces of cyanide were discovered Monday in two Chilean grapes
shipped to Philadelphia. The discovery followed anonymous threats to
the Japanese and U.S. embassies in Santiago that Chilean fruit would
be poisoned.
   The Chile government has reassured Tokyo it will step up safety
precautions to guarantee that grape shipments are safe, leading
Japan to lift its ban on imports, said Health and Welfare Ministry
official Katsumi Itoi.
   The decision comes on the heels of an announcement Friday by
Washington that Chilean fruit exports were once again welcome in the
United States.
   It also comes after the detention Thursday in southern Chile by
naval authorities of five Japanese fishing boats ``for safety
inspection.''
   Chilean navy commander Adm. Jose Merino initially said the ships
were being held until Japan lifted its ban.
   But Friday in a telephone interview, Chilean navy Lt. Jose Araya
said, ``The boats are retained and being subject to a mandatory
thorough inspection.
   ``This is necessary for the safety of all people on board those
vessels. Once inspectors are satisfied with the safety standards of
the boats, they will let them sail off.''
   Itoi, asked if the decision to lift Japan's ban on Chilean grapes
was diplomatically motivated, said: ``The health of the Japanese
people is our primary concern.''
   There was no immediate word today from Chile on Japan's lifting
of the ban.
   Japan has imported 1,775 tons of grapes from Chile so far this
year, representing about 20 percent of Japan's total imported grapes
for the period, according to government figures.

<HEAD>Ambassador: Hostage Freedom Hopes May Not Have Been Hurt By Rushdie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's ambassador in Lebanon said today the
prospect of freedom for Western hostages in Beirut may not have been
hurt by the controversy over Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   ``The general assumption is, I think, that the Rushdie affair has
put back prospects of release. I am not sure that is correct,'' the
ambassador, Allan Ramsay, said in a radio interview from Beirut on
the British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by some
leading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms
that there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is very
much a crime against Islam,'' he said.
   But, Ramsay warned, ``I do not want to raise release hopes and I
do not want to sound over-optimistic.''
   The Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on
Feb. 14 called for Rushdie's execution for writing ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which Moslems say blasphemes Islam. The Indian-born
author, now a British citizen, has been in hiding under police guard
since then.
   The 46-member Organization of Islamic Conference this week called
Rushdie an apostate, which under Islamic law is punishable by death,
and demanded that the book be banned.
   Asked about the release hopes for British hostages, Ramsay said:
``We have been at great pains to stress that one need not affect the
other _ that the hostage issue is essentially a humanitarian issue.''
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists, including Anglican
church envoy Terry Waite, British journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan, who has dual British and Irish citizenship.
   American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held of the 15 hostages. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Ramsay also played down suggestions that a car bomb blast Friday
about 50 yards from the British Embassy in east Beirut was intended
for the embassy. ``We had some windows blown out and one or two
other bits knocked off _ nothing very serious,'' he said.
   The explosion, which killed 15 people, was the worst in the area
of the embassy for some time, he said. He said he was unaware of any
increased hostility to Britons in Beirut since the Rushdie affair.

<HEAD>ACLU Plans Appeal Of Judge's Ruling To Uphold Ban On Medicaid Abortions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a 15-year-old allegedly impregnated
in a gang rape plan to appeal a court ruling upholding a law that
bans Medicaid funding for abortions.
   Circuit Judge John H. Hausner said in a 26-page opinion issued
Friday that there are no constitutional provisions entitling the
teen-ager to state money for an abortion.
   An appeal will be filed Monday with the state Court of Appeals,
said Elizabeth Gleicher, an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union, which brought the lawsuit on the girl's behalf.
   The ACLU contends the Medicaid ban is unconstitutional because it
discriminates against poor women.
   The lawsuit is the first challenge of the state's Medicaid-funded
abortion ban, which took effect Dec. 12 after voters approved it in
the Nov. 8 general election.
   The ACLU also will file a motion Monday asking the state Supreme
Court to hear the case immediately, bypassing the appellate court,
Gleicher said. The appeals process will continue even if the
teen-ager has an abortion, she added.
   ``Obviously we're unhappy and displeased with the judge's
decision,'' Gleicher said. ``But we always knew from the very start
that this case would have to be decided in the state Supreme Court.''
   Lawyers for the state and groups opposed to abortion were pleased
with the ruling.
   ``The will of the people has been vindicated. The ACLU's attempt
to impose its will on the will of the people has been rejected,''
said John Curcio, an attorney for Right to Life of Michigan.
   According to the ACLU, the teen, identified only as ``Jane Doe,''
became pregnant during a Jan. 15 rape and can't afford abortion
costs of between $250 and $1,000.
   ``If Jane Doe wants an abortion it cannot be funded by the state
Medicaid program but that does not mean that an abortion is not
available,'' Hausner said.
   Hausner cited the testimony of doctors who said they sometimes
perform abortions for free.
   Two of the teen-ager's alleged attackers, Aaron Wallace, 20, and
Edward Costnar, 17, both of Detroit, face trial on first-degree
criminal sexual assault charges on April 7.

<HEAD>Portuguese Diplomat Ordered To Leave Maputo As Dispute Deepens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today ordered a
Portuguese diplomat to leave the country within four days,
apparently in retaliation for Portugal's expulsion of a Mozambican
diplomat suspected of involvement in an assassination.
   Mozambique's Foreign Ministry said Jose da Silva Pereira,
commercial consul at the Portuguese Embassy in Maputo, has been
declared persona non grata and must leave by midnight Tuesday.
   The ministry accused the consul of engaging in unspecified
activities ``incompatible with his diplomatic status.'' The ministry
statement did not mention Portugal's expulsion Friday of Rafael
Custodio Marques, third secretary at the Mozambican Embassy in
Lisbon.
   Portugal accused Marques of involvement in the killing of former
Mozambican rebel leader Evo Fernandes. The expulsion order was
issued after Mozambique refused to waive Marques' diplomatic
immunity so he could be questioned about the case.
   The dispute has strained relations between Portugal and its
former colony at a time when links between them were growing.
   Portuguese newspapers have said a man held in connection with the
murder of Fernandes, former general-secretary of the Mozambican
National Resistance rebels, accused Marques of helping plan the
killing.
   According to the reports, Alexandre Chagas confessed to the
murder and said he was acting for the Mozambican government.
   Mozambique denies all involvement in Fernandes' death, claiming
he was killed as a result of infighting among the rebels.
   Portuguese police found Fernandes' body last April on a hillside
near Lisbon. He had been shot in the head and chest.
   Chagas and Joaquim Messias were arrested in Morocco and
extradited to Portugal to face charges in connection with the
killing.
   Fernandes, a Portuguese citizen, was a founder member of the
rebel movement and was its general secretary from 1983-1986.
   He was demoted to head of the rebels' research department but
observers said he remained an influential figure within the
organization.
   The rebels have waged a hit-and-run insurgency against
Mozambique's Marxist-oriented government since 1977, two years after
independence. Portugal does not support the the rebels, but allows
them to maintain an office in Lisbon.

<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea today accused the
United States of staging simulated nuclear attacks with B-52 bombers
on the Korean peninsula and demanded a halt to U.S.-South Korean
military exercises.
   U.S. officials rejected the North Korean charge. American forces
based in South Korea are believed to have nuclear weapons, though
Washington refuses to address the issue.
   North Korean officials said the U.S. Air Force was using up to
nine B-52 bombers from bases in Guam to stage daily nuclear attack
exercises over parts of South Korea that resemble targets in the
North. The officials said the exercise was preparation for a nuclear
attack on the North.
   Also today, radical students with firebombs battled riot police
in Seoul and Kwangju after rallies to demand withdrawal of U.S.
forces from South Korea. Riot police fired tear gas to drive back
about 400 protesters at Dongguk University in Seoul and about 800
protesters at Chonnam University in Kwangju.
   ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Withdraw U.S. forces!'' protesters
shouted.
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in the
annual exercises, which began Tuesday and end next week. The ``Team
Spirit'' exercises practice bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the
event of a North Korean attack.
   About 42,000 American soldiers are normally stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   North Korean delegates to the Military Armistice Commission
meeting at the border site of Panmunjom demanded U.S. and South
Korean forces immediately halt the annual exercises. The North once
again said the exercises are a grave threat to peace on the divided
peninsula and a barrier to peace talks.
   ``You should desist from attempting to justify your aggressive
acts and discontinue at once the criminal war exercise ... blocking
the way to detente and dialogue by leading the situation to the
brink of war,'' said North Korean Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung.
   The Armistice Commission polices the armistice that ended the
Korean War in 1953.
   U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Larry Vogt, head of the U.N. Command, and
other U.S. officials said no nuclear attacks were being practiced.
Vogt dismissed the North Korean charges as meaningless propaganda.
   The U.N. Command represents the 16 nations that sent troops to
aid capitalist South Korea against the 1950 North Korean invasion.
   Vogt charged North Korea was building up its military as part of
possible plans to attack South Korea. A North Korean attack launched
the Korean war in 1950.
   ``Your side's continued military buildup, forward deployment of
forces and secret military maneuvers _ all directed against the
Republic of (South) Korea _cause serious concern that your side may
be preparing for another act of aggression,'' Vogt said.
   Vogt repeated the U.S. position that the ``Team Spirit''
exercises are purely defensive.
   North Korea in the past has denounced the maneuvers and charged
they are part of preparations for a U.S. attack. But the exercises
this year stalled North-South talks on easing tensions. North Korea
said last month that progress in government talks was impossible if
the South went ahead with the exercises.

<HEAD>North Carolina Family Tells Of Abduction By Man Fleeing Shooting
Scene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PATERSON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family in New York for a funeral was
abducted by a man fleeing the scene of his wife's shooting and
forced to drive him in their car while he loaded a pistol and licked
the tip of each bullet.
   ``I thought he was going to kill us for sure,'' said Bobby Gee,
54, of Rocky Mount, N.C. ``We started to pray out loud as soon as he
got into the car. He told us to shut up.''
   The family was released uninjured after a harrowing two-hour
odyssey on the side of a highway on New York's Long Island and the
man turned himself in to Paterson police hours later.
   Victor Otero, 39, turned himself in Friday afternoon, and was
arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery
and unlawful possession of a weapon, Police Sgt. Craig Perrone said.
Otero was being held pending arraignment this morning.
   Police said Otero was wanted for the Thursday night shooting of
his estranged wife, 34-year-old Evelyn Diaz Otero. She was in
critical condition late Friday at St. Joseph's Medical Center, said
a nursing supervisor.
   The shooting began an interstate trek across the Hudson River and
a manhunt that involved police from Paterson, New York City and
Nassau County.
   Otero shot his wife several times about 10:15 p.m. Thursday in
this northern New Jersey city and fled in his own car only to get
into an accident a few blocks away, police said.
   Witnesses told police Otero pulled a revolver and ordered Nelson
Vazquez of Paterson to drive him to New York City. Vazquez dropped
Otero off near the New York end of the Lincoln Tunnel, police said.
   Otero then spotted Mrs. Gee and her family at a pay phone calling
a cousin for directions, The New York Times reported in today's
editions.
   The family _ Mrs. Gee's husband, Allious, 74; her grandson
Cedrick, 4, and her children from a previous marriage, Joel Hardy,
29, an Army staff sergeant stationed in Germany, and Barbi Hardy, 18
_ had left North Carolina early Thursday afternoon for the funeral
of Mrs. Gee's uncle in New York City.
   The gunman forced the family to drive him to Long Island.
   For a while, the Times said, Otero had the pistol aimed at Joel
Hardy's head as Hardy tried to find a way to Long Island. Part of
the time, he methodically loaded the gun and licked the tip of each
bullet before shoving it into the pistol chamber, the Times quoted
Barbi Hardy as saying.
   ``Now, I can shoot you all,'' Miss Hardy recalled the gunman
saying. ``One mistake and I'll shoot the boy in the head.''
   The gunman forced the family out of the car on the Long Island
Expressway, police said. Perrone said there were no reports of
injuries to the family or Vazquez.
   Otero then fled on foot. He contacted his relatives while on the

   The bat-wielding principal portrayed in the
movie ``Lean on Me'' is taking a leave of absence and considering a
post in the Bush administration.
   Eastside High School Principal Joe Clark said Friday that he is
in preliminary negotiations with drug czar William Bennett
concerning a job in Washington.
   ``Regardless of the outcome, I have decided to take a sabbatical
beginning in September 1989,'' Clark said in a statement.
   Clark also said his future plans include promoting his book,
``Laying Down The Law,'' writing a second book, developing
educational videos and increasing his lecture schedule.
   Clark was recently suspended for five days from Eastside over a
school assembly last month featuring a sequined dancer who stripped
her male partners down to G-strings. He said he was out of town
promoting ``Lean On Me'' on the day of the assembly and never
expected the dance group to perform as it did.
   Clark did not return telephone messages late Friday.

   Gunmen driving through a working-class
neighborhood in Pakistan's largest city today sprayed the streets
with gunfire, killing 12 people and wounding one in apparently
random attacks.
   Witnesses said the gunmen cruising in a car opened fire in five
locations in the Malir district in western Karachi.
   Police and soldiers in vehicles mounted with machine guns swiftly
converged on the district, which is near the international airport,
but the unidentified gunmen escaped, police said.
   The violence brought to 18 the number of people killed by
marauding gunmen in cars or on motorcycles in this seaport since
March 9. Police officials said they don't know who is responsible or
what motivates them.

   Authorities have issued new security orders to all
major British airports as a result of the December bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, a Manchester Airport spokesman said today.
   The reported orders came amid criticism by opposition Parliament
members, who say the government mishandled a warning of a terrorist
attack before the disaster, which killed 259 people on board and 11
on the ground in Scotland.
   The Department of Transport refused to confirm any new orders,
saying it would not discuss security arrangements.
   The Manchester Airport spokesman, who in keeping with British
practice refused to be identified, said the orders were received
Friday night. He gave no details because they dealt with security
matters.
   British new reports said the directive is believed to require
that all passengers be ordered to remove electrical and electronic
equipment from suitcases when they check in.
   They would then carry the items as hand luggage to be examined at
boarding gates, the British Broadcasting Corp. and other news
organizations said.
   Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 on Dec.
21 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was concealed in a radio-cassette
player. The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt, West
Germany, and passengers and luggage changed to a Boeing 747 in
London's Heathrow Airport.
   On Feb. 18, the Department of Transport advised all airlines
using British airports to begin asking travelers if their baggage
contained radios, computers or other electronic equipment and then
to examine the items for explosives.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon was criticized after admitting
this week in the wake of newspaper disclosures that authorities were
warned terrorists might bomb an aircraft with explosives hidden in a
radio-cassette player.
   In New York, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed Friday
that the airline had received a warning from the West German
government on Nov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette bomb that
caused the disaster. Pan Am has also acknowledged receiving a
warning from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
   But it said it received the British warning by mail weeks after
the air disaster. Channon said this week the British warning
contained ``unimportant'' information that supplemented what was in
the earlier warnings.
   A legislator in the governing Conservative Party on Friday
accused ``hysterical Americans'' of a witch hunt, while party
members rallied to fend off opposition charges over the airport
security controversy.
   ``If every government and every airline broadcast every warning
from every source _ crank or terrorist _ international air travel
would grind to a halt,'' the legislator, Robert Adley, said Friday.
``The culprit ... is the person who planted the bomb. It is not the
(British) Secretary of State for Transport.''
   Adley in his statement said ``malicious (opposition) Labor Party
politicians, hysterical Americans and news-hungry media'' had united
in a ``witch hunt aimed at the Conservative government'' and Channon.
   Adley, a senior member in the party of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, is an officer of the Conservative legislators' committee
on transport.
   Another Tory legislator, David Wilshire, said Friday that some
relatives of victims have been ``blaming the British government,
blaming Heathrow (airport), blaming anybody except the people I
think they ought to be complaining about: namely the American
government and Pan Am.''
   In Massachusetts, however, the parents of five American people
who died aboard the flight opened a petition drive Friday demanding
a U.S. inquiry and accusing Washington of treating them in a shoddy
manner.
   ``There is an enormous amount of anger and outrage at the way
we've been treated by this country's government,'' said Barbara
Primeau of Greenwich, N.Y. She spoke at a news conference in North
Adams, Mass.
   Her 20-year-old twins, Jason and Eric Coker, who were among the
victims.

   China's official Xinhua News Agency today
condemned recent petitions for the release of political prisoners
and sought to discredit the requests as invitations for foreign
pressure on China.
   The Xinhua commentary was the latest in a series of official
statements seeking to quell a growing clamor by Chinese
intellectuals for an amnesty for prisoners of conscience and greater
freedom of expression.
   China's leading dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, first
suggested an amnesty in an open letter to senior leader Deng
Xiaoping in January.
   Since then, 118 other intellectuals have signed three similar
letters, and hundreds of Chinese studying in the United States,
Chinese-Americans, Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese have signed
petitions of support.
   Several delegates are expected to push the idea at the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, which begins its annual
session Monday.
   The strongly worded Xinhua commentary, with its warning of
``foreign interference,'' appeared to be an effort to head off any
public statement at the congress that could embarrass the government.
   Xinhua accused the letter writers of ``using foreign public
opinion to exercise pressure on the Chinese government,'' although
no foreign government has officially commented on the amnesty drive.
   It noted that several of the letters appealed for the release of
Wei Jingsheng, a former Beijing electrician who was sentenced in
1979 to 15 years in jail for ``counterrevolutionary crimes.''
   Xinhua said Wei's case was raised ``not because he is important
but because his case aroused much discussion in the foreign press
when it became public in 1979.'' The London-based human rights group
Amnesty International has championed Wei.
   ``The Chinese people suffered enough from foreign invasions
before the liberation of the country,'' the commentary said. ``Many
problems and difficulties do exist, but these are China's own
affairs which the Chinese people will overcome by themselves.''

   President Bush says the national debate over
rapid-fire assault weapons has ``gotten pretty hot'' and any
decision about new restrictions will be made in ``a cool way based
on facts.''
   Bush hinted Friday he may be willing to take some steps beyond
the newly announced federal ban on imports of five popular types of
semiautomatic weapons. Law enforcement officials are pressing for a
prohibition covering weapons made in America as well.
   ``The police have been very concerned about this and we've got to
find an accommodation between the police and the sporting
interest,'' the president said.
   ``In my view there can be an accommodation, there must be an
accommodation,'' said Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association and outspoken foe of gun control.
   Asked if the new ban on imports represented a change in position
on gun control, Bush said, ``It represents certainly a heightened
concern on my part about AK-47s. It's a pulse change,'' he added,
grabbing his wrist.
   The debate over assault weapons has ``gotten pretty hot,'' he
said, ``but we'll make our decisions from the administration in a
cool _ you know, a cool way, based on facts and not swayed one way
or another by the temper of the debate.
   ``But I can understand when kids are shot down by an automated
weapon _ semiautomated weapon or automated, whichever it was _ why,
I can certainly understand the public outcry.'' Five children were
killed and more than two dozen others were wounded earlier this year
in Stockton, Calif., by a deranged gunman with a semiautomatic AK-47.
   The president discussed guns and other issues in a 30-minute chat
with reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from an
overnight speechmaking trip to Houston and Colorado Springs, Colo.
   Instead of their customary weekend at Camp David, Bush and his
wife Barbara were remaining at the White House because their
springer spaniel, Millie, was giving birth to puppies.
   ``It's changed my life, seriously,'' Bush said in mock horror.
``You think I'm kidding about that? It's awful.''
   The dog gave birth to six puppies over a five-hour period ending
at about 2 a.m. this morning, said White House spokeswoman Anna
Perez.
   Bush explained that the first lady had banished him from their
room to the Lincoln Bedroom because of Millie, who sleeps on their
bed.
   Bush said his wife explained that ``Millie had a very bad night
last night, thrashing around and you would be irritable.'' He added,
``So I'm being sent down the hall, which just suits the heck out of
me.''
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _No decision has been made on a proposed joint venture with the
Japanese for production in Japan of a new version of the F-16 jet
fighter. He sought to play down earlier suggestions that a basic
commitment had been made to the project, with only details remaining
to be worked out.
   _He was saddened that hostage Terry Anderson, Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was beginning his fifth year
of captivity in Lebanon, but said that wouldn't lead to any change
or reformulation in U.S. policy on hostages. The fact that Anderson
and other remain held against their will ``is with me every single
waking hour.''
   _He was concerned about the 1 percent increase in wholesale
prices in February reported Friday, claiming ``you always have to be
vigilant'' against inflation. He said the best way to fight
inflation was to reach agreement with Congress on reducing the
budget deficit.
   _Gave a thumbs-up sign on word that Rep. Richard Cheney had won
92-0 Senate confirmation as defense secretary. A Tuesday swearing-in
is planned, but Bush said ``he'll go to work right away'' at the
Pentagon.
   _Signed a proclamation designating May 4 as a National Day of
Prayer. It has been an annual event since 1952.

   A cargo plane carrying explosives
crashed after takeoff from Carswell Air Force Base early today,
killing the two people on board and igniting numerous grass fires,
authorities said.
   Air Force Lt. Brad Schudt said the two people killed likely were
civilians because the DC-9 was a private aircraft under contract to
the Air Force. The victims' identities were not immediately
available.
   ``All of the pastures were on fire,'' said Glen Youngblood, a
rancher who lives near the ranch where the plane crashed. ``I could
see the plane's tires and they were on fire. I told my wife it was a
plane crash, then I went to look to see if I could help.''
   He drove through burning pastures in his truck but found no
survivors.
   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist said the plane was
operated by Evergreen Air, a private contractor based in Oregon. The
plane that crashed was based in Marana, Ariz.
   The plane was en route to Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma when
the crash occurred about 2:30 a.m., said Air Force Senior Airman
Mark Webb. A military board will investigate the crash, officials
said.
   He said the cargo included 32 explosive fuses, which weigh a
total of about 11 pounds.
   The plane crashed into a field about seven miles north of the
base, which is about seven miles west of downtown Fort Worth.
   Robert Parkey, an investigator for the Tarrant County Medical
Examiner's Office, said he had been unable to go to the scene
because the area was cordoned off until daylight.
   Youngblood said the wreckage was scattered over five acres.
   ``If it had been in a populated area, there would have been more
lives lost than two,'' he said. ``It would have destroyed a lot of
people and homes.''
   The wreckage was almost unrecognizable in predawn light as an
airplane except for its large landing wheels and its instrument
panels, Youngblood said.

   To haunting strains of a newly composed
hymn, Polish farmers gathered with a sense of vindication today for
the first national congress in eight years of their banned union,
Rural Solidarity.
   ``We meet here in a dramatic situation,'' Rural Solidarity
chairman Jozef Slisz said. ``The national economy is destroyed.
People in towns and villages live on the edge of poverty. But this
is our country. We have to save it for ourselves and our children.''
   The congress brought together farmers from every region of the
country, plus foreign guests and a visit from Lech Walesa, chairman
of the allied independent workers' union, Solidarity.
   It took place even before the end of talks between the opposition
and communist authorities, which have yielded agreement in principle
to legalize Solidarity, Rural Solidarity and the Independent
Students' Association.
   All three were banned after martial law was introduced December
1981. On Tuesday, Parliament will consider draft legislation to
legalize them again.
   ``During those eight years, which we spent in prison or in
hiding, we did not forget the ideals of Solidarity. Some of our
colleagues paid with their lives,'' Slisz said.
   ``We can meet again after eight years thanks to Mr. Walesa,
thanks to his persistence and determination. He is the symbol of
Solidarity for cities and villages.'' The hall erupted into chants
of ``Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!'' when Walesa appeared.
   ``My role has been to lead you to this point, so that you can
meet and decide about your own activities,'' Walesa told them.
   Many farmers had traveled on overnight trains or slept in cars to
be on hand for the opening Mass at a modern church on Warsaw's
northern outskirts.
   Artur Balazs, a member of Rural Solidarity's national council,
said 450 delegates were attending, with 50 invited guests and
advisers.
   They met in a basement hall of the church dominated by a banner
proclaiming the National Congress of Rural Solidarity, 1981-89.
   Slisz said the congress must ensure that Rural Solidarity is
legalized and prepare for national elections of the union in
December.
   The Rev. Jan Bijak told farmers to draw inspiration for their
reborn organization from traditional values that made peasant
farmers the backbone of the nation. In a new hymn composed for the
congress, an altar assistant then sang, ``Mother lead us to your
Son, through our beloved soil.''

   Here is a look at El Salvador, a
nation nestled in the soft Pacific curve of Central America, a land
with a history of violence that is named for Jesus:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The country covers 8,260 square miles, about the size
of Massachusetts. It is rugged, a land of volcanoes and lakes and
rich soil. It is about 950 miles southwest of Miami, 950 miles
southeast of Brownsville, Texas.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ Its more than 5 million people are mainly Roman
Catholic and mestizo _ people of both Indian and Spanish heritage.
More than 500,000 of its residents have fled its 9-year-old civil
war, most of them to the United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ It was conquered in 1525 by the Spanish. It became
independent on Sept. 15, 1821 and joined the Central American
Federation, which later split into the nations that now make up
Central America.
   It was ruled for most of this century by a land-owning oligarchy
in alliance with the military.
   In 1932 a peasant rebellion organized by Farabundo Marti was
crushed by a military regime that killed 30,000 people; the leader
of that rebellion inspired the present guerrillas, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ It is mostly agricultural, with coffee the main cash
crop. In the 1960s and 1970s it became a manufacturing center for
the Central American market. Its largest input is U.S. military and
civil aid, which comes to $1.5 million a day.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE WAR _ The conflict began in 1979 when a group of young
officers overthrew then-president Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero. A
junta tried to impose agrarian and social reforms, but dissatisfied
leftists began a rebellion in late 1979.
   The conflict has led to more than 70,000 deaths, most of them
civilian, many of them suspected leftists killed by right-wing death
squads in the early 1980s.
   In 1984, Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, became the
first popularly elected president in 50 years. Sunday's election
marks the first time Salvadorans have had a chance to replace an
incumbent civilian government with a different party.

   Leftist guerrillas trying to
sabotage Sunday's elections with a boycott and transportation ban
have assured voters they won't be attacked if they go to the polls.
   However, some election workers in the capital and eastern areas
resigned Friday, saying they had been threatened. Two mayors also
quit after similar warnings.
   Despite the resignations, soldiers were ready to distribute
presidential ballots today to 236 of the nation's 260
municipalities. The exceptions are 24 municipalities under the
control of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Attorney General Roberto Garcia on Friday asked radio stations to
censor rebel dispatches and not broadcast appeals from the
guerrillas for an election boycott. Some statements were broadcast
anyway.
   The Christian Democrat party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte is
trying to retain power with candidate Fidel Chavez Mena, a former
foreign minister who says he represents new leadership and dismisses
charges of corruption and incompetence. Duarte has liver cancer and
by law cannot run for re-election.
   The front-runner, according to the polls, is businessman Alfredo
Cristiani, leader of the rightist and free market Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. That party, which in the past has
been linked to rightist death squads, already holds a slim edge in
the Salvadoran congress.
   Running third in the polls after Chavez Mena is Guillermo Ungo, a
left-wing Social Democrat who returned from exile in 1987. Four
other candidates are not given much chance in the polls of affecting
the outcome.
   Accurate polling is difficult in El Salvador, where nine years of
civil war and 70,000 deaths have made many people reluctant to
express their real preferences.
   The winner will replace Duarte, whose has been supported by the
United States in its efforts to reinforce a Democratic middle ground
against rightist and leftist extremes.
   The leading parties squabbled over placement of polling booths in
the capital, San Salvador. The Christian Democrats and Democratic
Convergence said Arena is trying to make the booths hard to reach.
   Election officials have put the booths in central locations, but
Arena wants them moved to the suburbs and other residential areas.
   Arena ``wants to locate the booths in areas that are hard to get
to because that's where the Salvadoran bourgeoisie lives,'' said
Ungo.
   Francisco Merino, Arena vice-presidential candidate, countered
that the booths must be put in secure areas to prevent rebel
disruptions.
   The mayors of Chalatenango, the northern provincial capital, and
Metapan, a northwestern city, resigned Friday under rebel warnings.
More than half the country's municipalities are without mayors, and
nine mayors have been assassinated.
   A number of poll workers in San Salvador and others in three
precincts near the city of San Miguel resigned Friday. They said
they had been threatened by guerrillas.
   However, voting is still expected to take place in those areas
with substitute officials.
   The guerrillas, however, said the death threats issued in their
name were forgeries.
   Moreover, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel political leader, said
Friday in an interview in Mexico City: ``We will not act against
those who are voting. Voters have that guarantee.''
   She said the rebels called for a boycott to show that no
political solution is possible without them. She said after the
election the rebels may renew their proposal to join the political
process under conditions that guarantee a fair vote.
   The rebels had asked for a postponement of the elections to let
them take part, but the government rejected their proposal.
   A rebel commander told The Associated Press on Friday that any
attacks on voters would be the work of rightist death squads trying
to discredit the guerrillas.
   There were no attacks on military garrisons during the day and
only scattered reports of attacks on private vans transporting
passengers in defiance of the rebels' traffic ban.
   Hector Oqueli, a leader of the Democratic Convergence, lauded the
rebels' decision not to harass voters.
   ``This reassures our people can now go to vote without worrying.''

   Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians and
wounded at least 17 today in clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip,
Arab reports said.
   The army command confirmed that several Palestinians were killed
and some wounded in riots in Gaza City, but it could not provide
exact figures.
   Also today, the army and Israel radio said a guerrilla squad
sneaked into Israel from Jordan and ambushed an Israeli army patrol
late Friday, killing a soldier and wounding another before escaping
back across the border.
   An Arab reporter in Gaza City said demonstrations occurred today
after Israeli policemen in jeeps and a gravel-firing machine arrived
in the Sheikh Rajwan neighborhood and glued placards to house walls
calling on the residents to maintain quiet. ``What's the benefit of
a demolished house, a killed son?'' the reporter quoted the placards
as saying. The reporter requested anonymity.
   Palestinians angered by the posters gathered at the local mosque
where loudspeakers called for a ``fight against the army,'' he said.
   Protesters took to the streets, pelting the soldiers with rocks,
he said. Youths erected roadblocks and burned tires in other areas
of Gaza City and the refugee camps of Rafah and Jabaliya, Arab
accounts said.
   On a central Gaza City street, an Arab wearing a shirt in the
colors of the banned Palestinian flag was forced to take it off and
then was beaten by soldiers as a crowd of Palestinians hurled stones
from afar, the reporter said.
   Merchants quickly shut down their stores and transportation came
to a halt. Only army vehicles, ambulances and U.N. cars were seen in
the streets, and thick columns of black smoke rose to the sky.
   ``There are burning tires and barricades everywhere,'' one Arab
witness said. ``It looks just like the beginning of the intefadeh,''
or the Palestinian uprising, with mass demonstrations of its early
months.
   In Sheikh Radjwan, where troops opened fire to quell the riots,
three Palestinians were killed, and at least 10 were wounded,
officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said. The army clamped a curfew
on the neighborhood.
   Arab doctors identified the fatalities as Fawsi Mohammed Bahid,
20, and Abdel Nasser Sherif, 16, who were both shot in the chest,
and Majdi Kourani, 19, who was shot in the neck.
   Seven other Palestinians were wounded elsewhere in Gaza City and
the seaside Gaza Strip, said doctors at Shifa and Ahli Arab
hospitals in Gaza City.
   About 200 youths surrounded Shifa Hospital, where the slain Arabs
were brought, and clashed with soldiers, an Arab reporter said.
   The deaths brought to 399 the number of Palestinians killed since
the rebellion began on Dec. 8, 1987, to demand an end to the Israeli
occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Seventeen Israelis
have also died.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas trying to
sabotage Sunday's elections by disrupting electrical power in the
capital and traffic on the nation's highways assured voters today
they won't attack people who vote.
   A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said
guerrilla military actions might be intense Sunday but that voters
will not be targeted.
   Today's warning about military activity followed two days of
relative calm in El Salvador. There were no new reports of rebel
attacks overnight.
   Earlier in the week, attacks by rebels knocked out much of the
electrical power in the capital, and their threat to kill people who
drove on the nation's highways drastically reduced traffic
nationwide.
   On Friday, two mayors and some election workers in the capital
and eastern areas resigned, saying they had been threatened by the
rebels.
   Soldiers prepared to distribute presidential ballots today to 236
of the nation's 260 municipalities. The exceptions are 24
municipalities under the control of the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   Attorney General Roberto Garcia on Friday asked radio stations to
censor rebel dispatches and not broadcast appeals from the
guerrillas for an election boycott. Some statements were broadcast
anyway.
   The Christian Democrat Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte is
trying to retain power with candidate Fidel Chavez Mena, a former
foreign minister who says he represents new leadership and dismisses
charges of corruption and incompetence. Duarte has liver cancer and
by law cannot run for re-election.
   The front-runner, according to the polls, is businessman Alfredo
Cristiani, leader of the rightist and free market Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. That party, which in the past has
been linked to rightist death squads, already holds a slim edge in
the Salvadoran congress.
   Running third in the polls after Chavez Mena is Guillermo Ungo, a
left-wing Social Democrat who returned from exile in 1987. Four
other candidates are not given much chance in the polls of affecting
the outcome.
   Accurate polling is difficult in El Salvador, where nine years of
civil war and 70,000 deaths have made many people reluctant to
express their real preferences.
   The winner will replace Duarte, whose has been supported by the
United States in its efforts to reinforce a Democratic middle ground
against rightist and leftist extremes.
   The leading parties squabbled over placement of polling booths in
the capital, San Salvador. The Christian Democrats and Democratic
Convergence said Arena is trying to make the booths hard to reach.
   Election officials have put the booths in central locations, but
Arena wants them moved to the suburbs and other residential areas.
   Arena ``wants to locate the booths in areas that are hard to get
to because that's where the Salvadoran bourgeoisie lives,'' said
Ungo.
   Francisco Merino, Arena vice-presidential candidate, countered
that the booths must be put in secure areas to prevent rebel
disruptions.
   The mayors of Chalatenango, the northern provincial capital, and
Metapan, a northwestern city, resigned Friday under rebel warnings.
   More than half the country's municipalities are without mayors,
and nine mayors have been assassinated.
   A number of poll workers in San Salvador and others in three
precincts near the city of San Miguel resigned Friday under threats
from guerrillas. The rebels said the death threats issued in their
names were forgeries, and voting was still expected to take place in
those areas with substitute officials.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel political leader, said Friday in
an interview in Mexico City: ``We will not act against those who are
voting. Voters have that guarantee.''
   She said the rebels called for a boycott to show that no
political solution is possible without them. She said after the
election the rebels may renew their proposal to join the political
process under conditions that guarantee a fair vote. The rebels had
asked for a postponement of the elections to let them take part, but
the government rejected their proposal.
   A rebel commander said in an interview Friday that any attacks on
voters would be the work of rightist death squads trying to
discredit the guerrillas.
   There were no attacks on military garrisons during the day and
only scattered reports of attacks on private vans transporting
passengers in defiance of the rebels' traffic ban.
   Hector Oqueli, a leader of the Democratic Convergence, lauded the
rebels' decision not to harass voters.
   ``This reassures our people can now go to vote without worrying.''

<TEXT>
   Shuttle watchers who
arrived in a parade of flag-bedecked motorhomes cheered, sang and
cried with pride today as the winged spacecraft Discovery returned
home.
   As the shuttle touched down the flag-waving crowd estimated at
450,000 broke into applause and spontaneously sang the national
anthem.
   Tears streamed from the eyes of some, while others among the
crowd hugged their children. Most snapped pictures furiously,
marveling at the shuttle's steep angle of descent.
   ``I'm just fascinated by it,'' said Bob Dube, 34, of Canyon
Country, Calif.
   Dube was one of hundreds poised for a quick getaway, and was on
the road right after the shuttle landed at 6:36 a.m. to avoid a
massive jam that soon stacked up on the Mojave Desert by the Rogers
Dry Lake public viewing site. Authorities estimated 138,000 vehicles
were on hand.
   ``It's Saturday, if it was a work day I'd hang around a little
longer,'' he said.
   As many as 300 motorists who arrived after roads to the base were
closed simply pulled their vehicles off the highway and drove onto
the desert to watch the landing.
   Several motorists ran into trouble, however, damaging their
vehicles' axles when they drove into large desert potholes.
   Today's crowd of 450,000 was the second-largest to witness a
shuttle landing. The record number was 500,000 for the shuttle
Columbia's July 4, 1982, landing.
   Many of the motor homes jamming the two-lane road leading toward
Rogers Dry Lake, where crowds began gathering earlier this week,
sported huge American flags.
   ``The patriotic spirit here is really something,'' said Ernie
Weiss, 70, of Garden Grove. ``I even bought a new flag for this.''
   Throngs of people, some arriving by motorcycle, others in cars
pulling travel trailers, arrived several days early to claim the
best viewing spots.
   On Friday, the strains of country music blared over loudspeakers
at the makeshift campground as military helicopters buzzed overhead
and skateboarders rattled across the hardened lake bed. Dune buggies
and other off-road vehicles filled the area five miles from the
Edwards Air Force Base landing site with clouds of dust.
   Weiss, who arrived Wednesday, said he was on hand when the
shuttle Atlantis landed last year.
   ``It was really worth it. It raises the hair on your back when
you hear those sonic booms. Teardrops fall and the whole thing,'' he
said.
   Many of the early arrivals were so-called ``snowbirds,'' retired
couples who spend their winters in warm climates.
   ``We winter in the South every year and we just had to see the
shuttle land,'' said 74-year-old Bill Henderson of Sunnyside, Wash.,
who arrived with his wife, Evelyn.
   ``I'm sure we'd see it better on TV, but we just had to be
here,'' he said.
   Pat Tolner, 35, a nurse from Annapolis, Md., witnessed the
shuttle lift off Monday in Florida.
   ``My husband wanted to know what I wanted for Christmas and I
told him I wanted to see the shuttle take off,'' she said. ``I spent
the night in the car and watched it take off, and when I got home I
told him I wanted to see it land. I flew to California Wednesday. I
rented a car and here I am.''
   Mrs. Tolner was quickly adopted by a family in a motorhome and
was celebrating with the rest of the crowd.
   ``Everyone has such a sense of pride and respect,'' she said.

<HEAD>Woman Jailed After Restroom Stop Made Her 10 Minutes Late For Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was 10 minutes late for a court
appearance because she stopped in a restroom was thrown in jail by a
judge upset by the delay.
   ``It was a complete abuse of discretion, an abuse of the bail
system,'' said attorney Mark Keenheel, representing Karen McCutchen.
   Ms. McCutchen, 23, was late for her preliminary hearing Wednesday
in connection with a robbery but needed to use a restroom, said her
sister, Deborah McCutchen, adding that she went on to the courtroom
to tell officials her sister would be there shortly.
   When Karen McCutchen reached the courtroom, Municipal Court Judge
Edward Mekel demanded to know why she was late, revoked her $10,000
bail, ordered her to jail and raised her bail to $25,000.
   Keenheel said he planned to file a complaint with the Judicial
Inquiry and Review Board. ``It was the most crazy, absurd,
outrageous thing I've ever seen,'' he said.
   A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday for reconsideration of the
increased bail.
   Ms. McCutchen is charged in the robbery of a store whose clerk
picked her photograph out of an array of eight pictures. Keenheel
said he planned to request a lineup during Wednesday's hearing to
see if the clerk could identify Ms. McCutchen in person.
   Deborah McCutchen said the judge accused her sister of staying
out of the courtroom so the clerk wouldn't see her before a lineup
could be arranged.
   Mekel could not be reached for comment Saturday; he was not in
his chambers and his home number is unlisted.

<TEXT>
   ABC is restoring the television series
``Moonlighting'' to its schedule after a four-week hiatus, but the
program is moving to Sunday, according to a network statement.
   The next episode of ``Moonlighting'' is scheduled for broadcast
at 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 2, said the statement issued Friday by
Capital Cities-ABC Television Network Group.
   The comedy was suspended Feb. 28 because last summer's strike by
Hollywood script writers led to a shortage of scripts and left the
argumentative characters, Maddie Hayes and David Addison, without a
word to say, executive producer Jay Daniel said.
   ``The rumor of our death is greatly exaggerated,'' Daniels said
at the time.
   However, ``Moonlighting'' had fallen in the ratings in its fourth
season and was being beaten regularly on Tuesday night's by NBC's
``In the Heat of the Night.''

   A guerrilla squad sneaked into Israel from
Jordan and opened fire on troops, killing an Israeli soldier and
wounding another before escaping back across the border, the army
said today.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack late Friday night,
the fourth guerrilla raid against Israel in a week.
   Jordan today said it arrested men who infiltrated Jordan from
Israel, apparently referring to the guerrillas who ambushed the
Israeli army patrol.
   The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, did not say how many
men were arrested, but it said they were captured at 7 a.m. in Wadi
Araba, the same region where the attack on the Israeli soldiers took
place.
   Petra said the incident was under investigation, but it gave no
other details and did not explicitly link the arrests to the Israeli
attack.
   The guerrillas ambushed the Israeli army patrol in the southern
Hatzeva area 70 miles south of Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman
said on condition of anonymity. He said the troops responded with
gunfire.
   Reserve Sgt. Oren Lior, 22, the commander of the unit, was killed
in the gunbattle and another soldier was wounded in the arm, the
spokesman said.
   The spokesman said a military unit discovered the tracks of two
men, showing they had crossed into Israel from Jordan and then
returned.
   According to Israel radio, the ambush occurred when the army
patrol followed tracks in the dirt and heard a man shout in English:
``Stop!'' from behind a bush. The guerrillas then opened fire from
two directions.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin blamed Palestinian guerrillas for
the attack. ``The Egyptian border, the Lebanese border and the
Jordanian one are different. If there is something in common it's
the wish of the Palestinian terror groups to attack us from all the
directions,'' he said on Israel radio.
   ``We hold Jordan responsible for preventing any infiltrations
from its territory. Moreover, we demand the Jordanian government do
everything to find who committed this vile murder and to make
certain this will not happen in the future,'' Rabin said.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, chief of the army's southern
command, described the incident as ``serious'' and said on Israel
radio the attack ``makes it necessary to take efficient steps on the
other side of the border to prevent any infiltrations into our
territory and attacks on our soldiers.''
   In Jordan, Information Minister Hani Khasawneh said, ``It is not
necessary that we comment on every story Israel broadcasts.''
   Two other raids this week were in southern Lebanon and the third
across the border with Egypt.

   A 48-hour strike for higher pay by state
railroad workers forced tens of thousands of vacationers and
commuters to change travel plans and aggravated Easter holiday
traffic problems, officials said Saturday.
   Railway unions arranged the strike to pressure management before
negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement. It was timed
to coincide with the start of Easter holidays and end midnight
Sunday.
   Company officials said the strike forced them to cut half the
scheduled trains, leaving 300,000 fewer seats on routes.
   The cutbacks contributed to traffic jams as commuters competed on
highways with holiday travelers flocking to the coasts and native
regions.
   The General Traffic Division said 19 people died on Spanish
highways over 19 hours Friday and Saturday.

<HEAD>Congress Becoming Restive over Salvador Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador has been receiving a huge slice of
the U.S. foreign aid program for years but now, as Salvadorans
prepare to elect a new president, many in Congress feel U.S.
taxpayers have not been getting their money's worth.
   The Salvadoran war still rages, having claimed an estimated
70,000 lives, the economy is stagnant and politically-motivated
killings are up, prompting some lawmakers to argue for a major
policy shift regardless of who the next Salvadoran president is.
   The pressure for a new approach is expected to accelerate if, as
expected, the candidate of the rightist ARENA party, Alfredo
Cristiani, wins the election outright on Sunday or the subsequent
runoff.
   His principal opponent is Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena.
   Despite Cristiani's denials, the perception among many who count
in Congress is that ARENA is tied to the death squads _ shadowy
groups who target both real and suspected leftists, sometimes in
cooperation with the military.
   Perception plays a key role in forming opinions on administration
policy. Democrats tend to be outraged by figures that show an
average of 20 political killings a month recently while Republicans
note that such incidents once averaged 800 a month.
   Still, the situation was serious enough to warrant a forceful
appeal last month by Vice President Dan Quayle to the Salvadoran
military ``to work toward the elimination of human rights
violations.''
   The administration also is worried that El Salvador might become
a strategic headache for the United States if the FMLN rebels
triumph. The State Department said Friday that Cuba has been the
source of large quantities of arms shipments to the guerrillas in
recent months.
   The United States has lavished $3.55 billion on El Salvador since
1980 _ the largest program in Latin America _ in a bid to help the
Salvadoran Army defeat the insurrection and to help the country
establish stable democratic rule.
   The strong support for El Salvador reflects in large measure
congressional affection for outgoing President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
whose commitment to democracy is unquestioned but whose legacy,
after almost five years in office, is regarded as mixed at best. Ill
with cancer since last year, Duarte will step down on June 1.
   A congressional report completed recently suggests U.S. policy
has actually made the situation worse in El Salvador.
   Critics, such as Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, contend the benefits have been meager
considering the size of the investment.
   ``For the past five years, El Salvador has enjoyed a free ride
with the American taxpayers footing the bill,'' he said Friday. ``By
most standards, U.S. policy has failed the test.''
   Harkin has introduced legislation requiring that half of
Salvador's military aid for 1990 be withheld pending a presidential
report on progress toward prosecution of human rights offenders and
toward ending the war and death squad activity.
   The program for the current year calls for $292.5 in economic aid
and $96.5 in military aid.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, told Secretary of State James A.
Baker III on Wednesday he believes the administration should
emphasize political and diplomatic measures to end Salvador's civil
war.
   ``I think up till now we've tried to implement primarily a
military track and it's failed,'' he said. ``I can't support more
aid with no strings attached without significant changes in our
whole approach to that country.''
   Baker strongly defended the Salvadoran government's approach to
the conflict, pointing out that the army has unilaterally declared a
cease-fire to last through June 1. In addition, five relatively free
elections have been held since 1982 and Duarte has made a number of
efforts to negotiate an end to the war, Baker said.
   Meanwhile, the rebels ``are doing whatever they can to disrupt
the election'' despite their stated desire for peace, Baker said.
   On Friday, State Department spokesman Charles Redman predicted
the rebel tactics will fail.
   ``We condemn FMLN violence and applaud the efforts of ordinary
Salvadorans to establish firmly democratic rule in their troubled
country. The elections on Sunday will be the next step to achieving
that goal,'' he said.

   Two men were sentenced to death Saturday for
killing one visiting Japanese businessman and robbing another, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Shanghai Intermediate People's Court convicted unemployed actor
Zhu Wenbo of smothering Koji Kobayashi in July in the victim's hotel
room, Xinhua said. Earlier reports said Zhu, 43, stole $545 worth of
Chinese currency from Kobayashi to cover gambling debts.
   The court also convicted 23-year-old Wu Guilong of robbing Yasuo
Kishiyo at knifepoint in October and taking nearly $1,000, Xinhua
said.
   Both attacks occurred in the Jinjiang Hotel, one of Shanghai's
best-known for foreigners.
   In the few previous cases of foreigners being slain in China,
those convicted also have been given the death penalty of a bullet
to the back of the head.

   Two months into his presidency, George Bush is
struggling with perceptions that he hit the ground walking and chose
a style of governance constrained by worry about policy stumbles.
   Bush has gone out of his way, in recent speeches and exchanges
with reporters, to drive home the message that the only treadmill
he's on is the exercising machine he uses in the White House
residence.
   He chafed at suggestions by critics that his go-slow strategy on
East-West relations gives Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev the
upper hand in world public opinion, saying ``I am not going to be
pushed into speedy action because Mr. Gorbachev gives a compelling
speech at the United Nations.''
   He undertook an almost painstaking explanation of why he ordered
time-consuming reviews of both foreign and defense strategy, saying
``we've got to map a strategy.'' But administration officials
acknowledge that Bush's pre-inaugural decision to conduct such
reassessments contributed to an image problem once he settled into
office.
   Bush said Thursday that he moved quickly to defuse such ``ticking
time bombs'' as America's endangered savings and loan industry. But
he also said getting the nation ready for the 1990s and beyond is
``what my (long-term) agenda is all about.''
   Speaking in this same context earlier in the week, he told
insurance executives that ``I want to be a president who is
remembered for preparing our country for the next century.''
   The administration has been beset in recent weeks with a spate of
news reports, often quoting both Democratic and Republican political
experts, saying Bush has adopted a too-cautious leadership style.
Because of this, the notion went, he missed the opportunity history
has afford new presidents get to establish an agenda in their first
100 days in the White House.
   Bush confronted such talk head-on during a question-and-answer
session with reporters on March 14 in which he denied the
administration was ``adrift.'' The president also argued that he had
moved as quickly as Ronald Reagan, in 1981, to choose people for
top-level jobs.
   What followed was an unmistakable White House campaign to blunt
any continuing talk of an aimless presidency.
   ``I'm particularly amused by the notion that the Bush
administration must do all kinds of things in our first hundred
days,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told the National Press Club.
``We're succeeding an administration of our own party at a time when
the country is in good shape. ...
   ``The notion of the `100 days' came in with Franklin Roosevelt,
who took over a country in the depths of a depression,'' he said.
   James David Barber, a presidential scholar at Duke University,
disagreed.
   When Bush talks about vision, he asked, ``Does that mean
anything? When he says something, hang loose until he does it. Drug
war? Where is it? Education president? When?''
   Thomas Edmonds, a Republican political consultant, said Bush
``has got to satisfy the public's need to see accomplishments taking
place.''
   ``It's not enough to be just a statesman. You have to be a
politician as well,'' he said. Edmonds noted that Reagan
successfully used television frequently to ``visually demonstrate
forward motion'' _ even if little was being done.
   Stephen Studdert, a special assistant to Bush who helps plan the
president's activities and concerns himself with the president's
image, said: ``I think the 60-day report card is probably going to
be pretty tough. But I think the 365-day report card is going to be
a better barometer.''
   White House officials say Bush has moved forthrightly with his
domestic policy agenda, noting that in addition to proposing a
rescue plan for the troubled S&amp;Ls, he has continued to seek a budget
compromise with Congress and sent lawmakers his legislative
proposals on such issues as child care and the minimum wage.
   One official, discussing Bush's strategy on grounds of anonymity,
acknowledged, however, that presidential aides recently scrapped the
``theme-a-week'' strategy used early on _ ethics one week, budget
the next, drugs the next, and so forth.
   The official said the unpredictable flow of news events, and the
extent to which a president's visibility is often dictated by these
occurrences, made it impractical to try to sustain a single theme
through a week's time.
   Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant, said Bush had ``a good
inaugural'' and had set a constructive tone in his statements about
seeking bipartisan consensus on major issues.
   But he said the Bush White House ``wasted tremendous political
capital'' on the enervating battle to win confirmation of former
Sen. John Tower as secretary of defense.
   ``History has shown that the first 100 days will prove the tone
and the effectiveness of a new administration, and he's wasted
two-thirds of it,'' Greer said. ``And I think what you're headed for
is a weak presidency.''

   More than 200 Tibetan monks and nuns
marched silently to a war memorial Saturday to protest Chinese rule
in their homeland, a Tibetan spokesman said.
   The maroon-robed clerics marched nearly three miles from Yamuna
River to India Gate, the country's momument to soldiers killed in
World War I, said Soepa Gyatso.
   Religious leaders addressed demonstrators to condemn the
imposition 11 days ago of martial law in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa,
he said.
   Four monks later delivered a memorandum at the Chinese Embassy
demanding China withdraw from Tibet, he said.
   Clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and Chinese police
in Lhasa early this month left 16 people dead and more than 100
wounded by official count. Western travelers said the death toll may
be 20 or 30.
   ``Many monks and nuns were shot and beaten to death and (many)
are being tortured in prison,'' Gyatso said. It was impossible to
confirm his charges independently.

   For one night at the Subs Club bar, everything was
on the house _ even much of the house itself.
   A brash manager, without the owner's permission, apparently gave
away $2,000 worth of liquor, beer and wine, police reported. He also
gave away or sold tables, chairs, glasses, a television set and 15
neon beer signs.
   The cash register also went. The manager apparently pocketed any
money made on the sales, police said.
   ``Apparently their liquor license was expiring and they were
going to close shop,'' police investigator Michael Falls told the
Dallas Times Herald. ``The manager may have just taken advantage of
the situation. He apparently decided to just go ahead and give
everything away.''
   The bar's owner, Jimmy Fields of Garland, discovered the loss
when he arrived about 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Several patrons told him
that the manager told people in the bar at 5 p.m. that they could
have anything they wanted on the house.
   Falls said he tracked down one woman who got in on the windfall
happy hour.
   ``She said he was handing things away right and left and that she
had got a bottle of liquor,'' Falls said.
   Falls said the manager could be arrested and charged with theft
once police make certain that he held no ownership stake in the club.

   Discovery's astronauts
swooped out of orbit to a desert landing and the cheers of 450,000
spectators today after a nearly flawless journey that completed a
vital space communications network and mapped a fragile Earth.
   Commander Michael Coats guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a
touchdown on a concrete runway at this flight test base at 6:36
a.m., concluding a flight that covered 1.9 million miles in 4 days,
23 hours, 39 minutes.
   The shuttle landed on the runway's center line.
   ``Well done Discovery. That's one to be proud of,'' capsule
communicator Frank Culbertson said as the craft rolled to a stop.
   Forty-five minutes after touchdown, the five astronauts, all
looking fit and smiling, left the spacecraft and were met by several
NASA officials.
   They took the traditional walkaround inspection of Discovery, and
closeup television pictures showed the fuselage in very good
condition. There was no evidence of the severe tile damage that
Atlantis suffered in December when it was hit by insulation falling
off a booster rocket and fuel tank during the launch.
   The crew was driven to a medical facility for brief examiniations
and later were to meet with their families before flying back to
their training base in Houston.
   ``There is no significant damage to the tiles,'' shuttle chief
Richard Truly told a news conference. ``This is the cleanest orbiter
of any orbiter I've ever seen.''
   Truly said the astronauts were very healthy and said the flight
``shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is.''
   Two loud sonic booms cracked over the California desert as
Discovery glided powerless through clear skies, with the huge crowd,
some waving American flags, shouting its approval from viewing sites
on parched Rogers Dry Lake.
   The Air Force estimated the crowd, which streamed in overnight in
more than 138,000 vehicles, at 450,000.
   An hour before landing, Coats fired braking rockets 196 miles
above the Indian Ocean to drop Discovery out of orbit and start it
on a fiery dive through the atmosphere on a course over the
mid-Pacific, across the California coast south of Santa Barbara and
into this Mojave Desert base.
   ``Discovery's coming home,'' Coats radioed after the firing.
   The spaceship was traveling more than 200 mph when it touched the
runway, but slowed quickly as Coats operated new brake systems
designed to improve performance.
   As the flight neared an end, the crew tidied up the cabin,
checked all reentry systems, closed the payload bay doors and donned
bulky spacesuits for use in case of an emergency bailout.
   The astronauts were awakened today by a recording of their
children saying such things as, ``Get up, dad, get out of bed, get
to work,'' and ``Hi, daddy, this is your darling daughter telling
you to wake up.''
   That was followed by a recording of Louis Armstrong's ``What a
Wonderful World.'' The crew responded with a recording of Simon and
Garfunkle's ``Homeward Bound.''
   It was the 28th shuttle mission and the third since the
Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years
ago. NASA hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by
1992.
   ``It's about the cleanest flight we've had from a failure
standpoint,'' flight director Charles Shaw said Friday night. ``I've
been involved in every shuttle flight and I've never seen so few
failures.''
   The only problem came early in the mission from an erratic
pressure reading on a hydrogen tank that helps provide electricity
to the orbiter. The astronauts conserved energy by turning off
unnecessary lights and computers for a day until ground controllers
corrected the difficulty.
   The shuttle is commanded by Coats. The pilot is John Blaha and
the mission specialists are James Buchli, James Bagian and Bob
Springer.
   The five completed their primary mission just six hours after
liftoff from Cape Canaveral on Monday, the deployment of a $100
million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite that completes a
constellation of three such spacecraft. The new satellite, which
will be operational in a few weeks, will enable NASA to have nearly
constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites.
   At that point, the space agency will begin closing six ground
stations at a savings of $13 million a month.
   With the satellite deployed, the astronauts turned their
attention to photographing the Earth and conducting several
experiments.
   They shot nearly three miles of film with a 70mm IMAX camera,
capturing views of pollution patterns in oceans, floods in Africa,
burned areas of the Florida Everglades and western United States,
deforestation in Brazil and erupting volcanoes in South America and
Southeast Asia.
   During an interview from space Friday morning on NBC's ``Today''
show, Buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution ``is much
more dramatic'' as seen from orbit.
   ``What we're trying to do is get some evidence and documentation
to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into this
atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future
generations,'' Buchli said.
   The IMAX film will be edited into a movie called ``The Planet
Earth,'' which will document environmental damage by man and nature.
   Some of the experiments aboard Discovery included the use of four
rats and 32 fertilized chicken eggs.
   The end of the mission also marked the end for the rats, which
were to be killed soon after touchdown so researchers can determine
how their intentionally cut legs healed in the weightlessness of
space.
   Most of the eggs, housed in an incubator, will be allowed to
hatch to see if embryos can develop normally in space.

<HEAD>Trendy Designer To Revamp Young Soviet Fashion Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Soviet women will soon be able to discard
their unstylish clothes and for the first time buy the same trendy
fashions as their European and American counterparts.
   Three European companies are finalizing joint-ventures they
believe will revolutionize Soviet fashion by offering Soviet women
the Western styles they can now get only from friends traveling
abroad, foreign currency stores or the black market.
   The deals will put branches of Britain's Coppernob chain and
Italy's Stefanel and Benetton chains _ which all cater to the youth
market _ in cities across the Soviet Union.
   Soviet women will get their first chance to buy Western clothes
by the end of March when Stefanel expects to open two stores in
Leningrad, Federico Steiner, an account executive for Stefanel's
public relations firm, said Friday in Rome.
   Under a joint venture contract with the city of Leningrad signed
in September, he said, one store will accept the Soviet ruble and
the other dollars, which tourists and limited numbers of Soviets
have access to.
   American-born designer Gifi Fields, whose Coppernob clothes are
sold in more than 50 British stores, said Friday he expects to open
four or five stores in Leningrad this fall _ all accepting rubles.
   He also expects to open a Leningrad factory by the end of the
year to assemble partly made clothes imported from Britain.
   A Benetton spokesman, Marino Verengo, said the company has been
negotiating an agreement with the Soviet government that would allow
them to open about 50 stores in Soviet cities and build two or three
factories to produce Benetton clothes for the Soviet market. He said
the agreement was likely to be signed this year.
   Fields credited Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's desire to
reform the Soviet economy and meet the growing demand for consumer
goods for the decision to allow Western clothing firms into the
country for the first time.
   The joint ventures, he said, offer ``a historic opportunity'' to
bring the Soviet people closer to their European neighbors with whom
they share a similar culture and taste in clothes.
   ``Obviously there's a great potential in a market which is
basically dealing in total functional clothing with no flair,'' said
Fields, 37, in an interview.
   He said London-based Coppernob has reached agreement in principle
with two Leningrad cooperatives, Nevski Zori and Lilia, to open the
factory and branches throughout the Soviet Union. Details of the
accord, reached during a trip to Leningrad in February, were being
finalized.
   Under the deal, he said, Coppernob will invest any profits in the
Soviet Union. He did not say how much Coppernob would invest in the
project.
   ``Initially we're starting the operation off as small,'' he said.
``I can see us in 10 years time producing mega-amounts of fashion
clothing in the Soviet Union not only for the marketplace in the
Soviet Union but to service the rest of Western Europe and possibly
even the United States.''
   The clothes going on sale in Leningrad this fall will be
virtually the same as the clothes he'll be selling in London or
Washington _ lots of wool tweed jackets with short skirts or jeans,
rich corduroys and stylish but simple velvet dresses.
   ``Good young fashion is like music, it transcends all
boundaries,'' Fields said.

<HEAD>North Defense Focuses On Reagan Iran-Contra Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North's lawyers are defending their
client by trying to show President Reagan personally directed a
strategy of secretly assisting the Contras without informing
Congress.
   The approach by North's lawyers has featured two significant
disclosures so far at his trial:
   _Reagan signed off on a deal to slip $110 million in extra aid to
Honduras in exchange for that country's government help to the
guerrillas.
   _The president apparently gave the go-ahead for airdropping
intelligence and recoilless rifles for the sinking of arms-bearing
ships, this at a time when Congress had banned military aid to the
Contras.
   North's lawyers have been able to focus much attention on
Reagan's role in secretly supporting the Contras, with more
disclosures to come.
   Part of North's defense is built around previously unpublicized
quid pro quo arrangements the Reagan administration had with
Honduras and other countries.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan is hoping, through the discussion
of Reagan's role, to convince the jury that North's actions in
secretly helping the Contras were taken at the behest of the
president.
   ``We don't comment on pending legal matters,'' Mark Weinberg, a
spokesman for the former president, said when asked about the
testimony concerning Reagan's actions.
   The apparent weak point in Sullivan's approach is that it relies
on blurring the line between lying to Congress and avoiding Congress.
   Before Reagan initialed the secret quid pro quo arrangement with
Honduras in 1985, North recommended that a special emissary unlikely
to be questioned by Congress be entrusted with details of the
proposed deal.
   The normal course would have been to communicate the arrangement
through the U.S. ambassador to Honduras, who could expect to be
called to Capitol Hill for questioning.
   Former-national security adviser Robert McFarlane testified at
North's trial that Reagan agreed Congress shouldn't be told about
third-country support for the Contras.
   The president's inner circle of advisers kept information on
Contra aid secret, even from each other. What they didn't know, they
wouldn't be able to communicate if asked by Congress.
   Members of the National Security Planning Group, including the
president and vice president and several Cabinet officers, discussed
the possibility of pressing third countries for Contra aid at a 1984
meeting in the White House Situation Room.
   Unbeknownst to some of them, Saudi Arabia had already agreed to
give $1 million a month. McFarlane, who moderated the meeting,
remained silent about the Saudi arrangements, which he had helped
set up.
   When a State Department official was questioned by Congress, he
responded that he had heard there was third-country support for the
Contras, but that he knew nothing about it.
   McFarlane, who did know, wasn't asked.
   But a strategy of silence was no longer possible in September
1985. By that time, the news media were linking North to
fund-raising efforts and tactical advice being offered the Contras.
   Letters came in from Congress. Answers were demanded. McFarlane
was on the spot.
   In testimony last Thursday, the former national security adviser
said he discussed the congressional queries with Reagan.
   There was no indication from McFarlane's testimony that Reagan
recognized the complexion of the problem had changed completely;
that in order to retain secrecy, answers would have to be hedged or
falsified.
   McFarlane said he simply told the president that ``we were bound
to be criticized in any event,'' no matter what the responses to
letters from Congress.
   Reagan ``accepted it,'' saying, ``OK,'' McFarlane recalled.
   Prosecutor John Keker, in his questioning of McFarlane,
repeatedly elicited testimony that Reagan never suggested lying to
Congress, part of the prosecution's effort to show it was North's
idea.
   Four of the 12 criminal charges against North are that he
obstructed Congress or made false statements by preparing written
denials in 1985 that National Security Council staffers were
involved in assisting the Contras.
   McFarlane, who signed the letters, pleaded guilty to three
misdemeanors and was fined $20,000. McFarlane also pleaded guilty to
a fourth misdemeanor in connection with congressional testimony he
gave denying knowledge of Saudi government support for the Contras.

<HEAD>Deliberations Begin in Wright Ethics Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright appears to be bracing
for bad news from the 12 members of an ethics committee who convene
this week to deliberate a series of charges against him in a process
not unlike that of a grand jury.
   Wright has suggested in recent days he would be willing to admit
to bad judgment in handling his finances if the panel draws such
conclusions. He also has enlisted lieutenants to defend him on the
House floor and sought advice on how to handle his situation from
close House colleagues.
   At the same time, nervousness is rising among House Democrats and
there are murmurs of severe political trouble for the speaker even
if the panel recommends mild sanctions for any rules violations.
   The committee, after a lengthy investigation, heard three weeks
of arguments from its investigator, Chicago attorney Richard Phelan,
and Wright's lawyer, William Oldaker.
   Wright is accused of misusing his office for financial gain,
including using staff to prepare a book on which he earned $55,000
in royalties, accepting free use of a Fort Worth condominium and
improperly lobbying federal savings and loan regulators.
   The ethics panel was to resume deliberations on Monday and
planned to meet most of the week. Members said it increasingly
appeared that no result would be reached until after Congress
returns from its Easter break in early April.
   The committee could recommend sanctions ranging from censure to
expulsion if it finds the Texas Democrat violated House rules. Such
a recommendation is akin to a grand jury indictment and would be
subject to a disciplinary hearing and ultimately a vote of the
House. If it finds no merit to the charges, it could simply drop the
case.
   As the committee met behind closed doors last week, Wright was
sending intriguing public signals. At an impromptu lunch with
reporters on Tuesday, he grew contemplative and said he might not
run for a third term as speaker if the ethics report eroded his
backing among Democrats.
   ``I wouldn't want to be speaker unless my colleagues want me to
be speaker,'' he said.
   At the same session, he seemed to be preparing for a harsh report.
   ``If the committee should say, ... `We think this is bad
judgment,' well, I'll accept that. I have confidence in them. I'm
not going to quarrel with that. I probably have done things which in
hindsight were poor judgment.''
   But he continued to deny any violation of House rules and
suggested that any lapses were the result of inattention to his
personal finances rather than intentional wrongdoing. And he said
his support remains strong.
   ``After this is resolved, I'll be stronger than ever,'' Wright
said. ``My colleagues have confidence in me, or they tell me they
do.''
   Wright's comments came after his attorney had heard Phelan
present his findings to the ethics panel. The tone was markedly
different from last June, when Wright defiantly asserted: ``It
should be abundantly clear that the charges against me hold no water
whatsoever.''
   Both the chairman of the ethics committee, Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., and the senior Republican, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana,
say they believe a polarized, partisan outcome to the probe is
unlikely.
   ``I have no reason now not to believe it will be bipartisan,''
Dixon told the Wall Street Journal.
   That raised the possibility that some counts against Wright have
enough weight that Democrats will feel compelled to vote for a
statement of alleged violation, the panel's equivalent of an
indictment.
   According to many House members interviewed last week, such a
move would put the speaker's job in serious jeopardy.
   ``I think concern is rising,'' said one senior Democrat, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``It's a very serious matter.''
   ``The guy has problems,'' said another Democratic lawmaker,
saying Wright's alleged misdeeds would become a difficult election
issue for the party. ``Members don't want to be defending their
leaders. They want leaders they can be proud of, and who help them.''
   Added another: ``We are weary of having this color our whole
existence. People back home keep reading and hearing about it. I'm
trying to do important work here, but they don't see that. I'm
concerned about the perception.''
   While Democrats generally would not speak on the record,
Republicans weren't so reticent. Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.,
chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said his party was
being careful not to make the speaker's problems appear the result
of a partisan vendetta.
   ``I hear it's going to be very tough, a lot of different counts,
sufficient to indicate a pattern of misjudgment or ethical lapses,''
Edwards said. He said that in some ways the Republicans would be
better off with a wounded Wright as speaker than with a
squeaky-clean replacement.
   ``I'd much rather have Jim Wright as speaker with half the United
States wondering, `What's going on with this guy?''' Edwards said.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 400 years ago a young man about London
apparently tried to start what would now be called a punk fashion:
he took to wearing his blonde hair long over his left shoulder but
short on the other side.
   The fashion failed to catch on but the young man, Henry
Wriothesly, Third Earl of Southampton, is remembered anyhow. Many
authorities believe William Shakespeare was writing his sonnets at
the time _ 1594 _ in support of a family effort to make the
20-year-old earl get married and produce an heir.
   Shakespeare wrote two longer poems for him, one with a dedication
evidencing as much friendship as was socially acceptable at that
period between a mere playwright and a nobleman.
   A tiny oval portrait of Southampton, showing the unsuccessful
``lovelock,'' is a feature of a show of ``Treasures from the
Fitzwilliam,'' the museum of Cambridge University in England,
opening Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   ``The Fitzwilliam is perhaps Britain's pre-eminent small
museum,'' said J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery.
   The painting is by Nicholas Hilliard, the most famous miniaturist
of the period. Only about an inch and a half in height, it was done
on the back of a calfskin playing card. Three hearts can still be
seen on the other side.
   Southampton did get marrieda few years later, after a scandalous
affair with a lady in waiting to Queen Elizabeth. He had been a
favorite of the queen and later she commuted a death sentence
against him for taking part in a conspiracy against her. He died on
a military expedition to the Netherlands in 1624.
   The exhibition includes more than 160 objects from the
Fitzwilliam. They range from a bit of soft-core pornography by the
18th century British satirist William Hogarth to a portrait by Sir
Anthony Van Dyck of Arhcbishop William Laud _ a strict and highly
dignified churchman who helped get King Charles I into a lot of
political trouble 100 years before. Both Laud and the king were
beheaded.
   There are also a little water spaniel in painted porcelain and
assorted coins, drawings, furniture, manuscripts and bronzes.
   The most famous painting is one by Titian that by coincidence
deals with the same subject as Shakespeare's poem to Southampton
with the friendly dedication, ``The Rape of Lucrece.'' The picture
was painted in Italy, about 25 years before Shakespeare wrote the
poem.
   The exhibition will be at the gallery's East Building through
June 18. Then it goes to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth,
Texas, July 15 to Oct. 8; the National Academy of Design in New
York, Nov. 5 to Jan. 28, 1990; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta,
Georgia, Feb. 20 to May 6, 1990 and the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, June 21 to Sept. 9, 1990.

   Millie, the first dog, was nursing her litter
of six pups today after giving birth at the White House with first
lady Barbara Bush serving as midwife, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush
said.
   ``Mom and babies and midwife are doing fine,'' said spokeswoman
Anna Perez, who said the puppies were born over a five-hour period
ending at about 2 a.m. this morning.
   ``It was a wonderfully uneventful birth,'' Ms. Perez said, adding
that the litter contained five females and one male.
   Today the puppies were ``nursing vigorously,'' and Millie had
eaten as well, she said.
   Mrs. Bush took Millie out for a walk twice today.
   Word that Millie was about to deliver came about 9 p.m. Friday as
the Bushes were entertaining a group of guests for a movie, ``New
York Stories,'' in the White House theater following dinner.
   Mrs. Bush slipped quietly out, and, according to Ms. Perez, ``At
the end of the movie, the president announced we had two puppies and
more on the way.''
   Subsequently, ``the president was in on one birth, lending moral
support,'' and he brought Mrs. Bush a folding mattress in the remade
White House beauty salon where the birthing room had been set up.
   Ms. Perez said she was talking on the phone to the first lady
when, ``She said `Here comes George with a bed. Isn't that sweet?'''
   According to Ms. Perez, the sire of the litter was another
springer spaniel, Tug III, owned by a family friend, William Farish,
who also gave them Millie. Tug III lives at Lane's End Farm in
Versailles, Ky.
   ``The puppies are all promised, but for the next four to six
weeks they will live upstairs at the White House,'' the spokeswoman
said.
   Millie's pregnancy had already caused an upheaval in sleeping
arrangements at the highest level of the nation's government.
   Earlier Friday, President Bush disclosed that although the
puppies were born in a whelping box in the beauty parlor, the dog
had been spending her nights in the first family's bedroom.
   Bush said he'd been spending the nights by himself.
   ``The dog refuses to go to the doghouse is the problem,'' Bush
told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One.
   He said the dog adamantly refused to use ``a beautiful pen made
for her to have this blessed event in,'' and insisted on remaining
in the White House master bedroom.
   On Friday, Bush had a bed moved into the beauty parlor for the
first lady, Ms. Perez said. He then went to bed by himself in
another room, she said.

<TEXT>
   Prices are on the upswing even as signs of an
economic slowdown emerge, suggesting Americans may have to pay now
for earlier robust growth in the economy and wait until later for
inflation relief.
   Concern about inflation heightened last week after the Labor
Department reported that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February for the second straight month, representing a 12.6 percent
annual rate of inflation so far this year.
   Consumer prices, meanwhile, rose 0.6 percent in January, a pace
that would translate into a 7.2 percent annual inflation rate at the
retail level if sustained all year. Financial markets will be
anxiously awaiting February's readout on consumer prices, due to be
released Tuesday.
   A booming economy can generate inflation if tight labor markets
and strong demand for goods and services create shortages that drive
up wages and prices, which then chase one another upward.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been nudging interest
rates higher in order to cool the red-hot economy and restrain
inflation, but the latest reports show that prices were accelerating
nonetheless.
   The troubling news came just as economists were starting to take
some cheer from indications that economic growth may be moderating
to a more sustainable level. Retail sales, factory operating rates
and housing starts all were down last month.
   So why did prices rise?
   ``It reflects mainly strong growth in the economy in the past
couple of years and full employment and high operating rates,'' said
Robert Ortner, outgoing Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
   He cautioned that given the lag time between an economic slowdown
and the resulting downward pressure on prices, ``the worst of both
worlds is not impossible.''
   ``The risk is that we will get both slower economic growth and
continued inflation and that certainly is what we hope to avoid,''
Ortner said.
   The concern was echoed by Michael Evans, head of a Washington
consulting firm. ``To find out that inflation is almost out of
control here, just as we see evidence the economy is slowing, is
clearly the worst possible scenario,'' he said. ``We could have a
rough couple months ahead. The old nemesis stagflation could come
back to haunt us.''
   The term ``stagflation'' was coined in the 1970s, when America
experienced the unprecedented combination of slower economic growth
and rising prices.
   Initial forecasts for this year were that inflation would
increase somewhat from the 4.4 percent pace of the last two years,
but many estimates are being revised upward based on the surprising
price increases in January and February.
   Meanwhile, growth in the economy is expected to slow this year as
the record peacetime expansion extends through its seventh year.
Indeed, some critics of the Federal Reserve say the central bank's
tight grip on the money supply could dampen the economy so much that
the country topples into a recession.
   ``The Fed must be patient because it takes a long time for
changes in monetary policy to have an impact on prices,'' said
Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``The immediate focus must be on the signs of economic contraction
which indicate that Fed policies have become too severe.''
   Some analysts, however, believe a recession may be the only way
to reduce inflation once it starts spiraling.
   ``Unless we have a recession, we don't think inflation is going
to come down that much,'' said economist John Hagens of the Wefa
Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``It shows the cost of reducing inflation.
It also shows the cost of not keeping inflation from accelerating.''
   Americans paid that price in the last economic downturn, when
then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker pushed the prime rate up
to a high of 21.5 percent to combat the nation's worst case of
inflation since the Civil War.
   Volcker won the war, but not without plunging the country into
the 1981-82 recession, the worst downturn since the Great Depression.

<HEAD>Four Years of Captivity for Terry Anderson</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freshmen have become graduates. Ronald Reagan
has served a second term in the White House and retired. President
Bush has come to office with an inaugural call for those who hold
Americans captive to free them and beget an era of good will.
   And Terry Anderson, prisoner of Beirut, has seen none of it.
   Incredibly, it has been four years since the Saturday morning the
telephone rang with word that Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, had been kidnapped by gunmen
on the way home from a game of tennis.
   At the time, it seemed to his editors and others among his
colleagues that the kidnapping probably was an outrageous scare
tactic aimed at reporters, and that Anderson would be held for a
day, perhaps a few days.
   That had happened before, to other journalists, in the chaos
among the factions still battling in Beirut.
   But the days stretched into a sentence that has passed its fourth
year with no sign of a way out.
   The signal dates that might be chosen for release _ a birthday,
then another and another; the presidential election; the Bush
inauguration _ have passed with no respite for Anderson. The first
and only declared demand of the captors was for the release of
radical Moslems imprisoned in Kuwait for terrorist activities.
   In his inaugural address, Bush spoke of the hostages, Anderson
and eight other Americans seized after he was taken. Reagan seldom
had spoken of their captivity since the scandal that embroiled his
administration over the sale of arms to Iran. Three American
hostages were freed in Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985
and 1986.
   ``There are today Americans who are held against their will in
foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' Bush said.
``Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good
will begets good will.''
   In an interview, Bush was more explicit, saying that he looked to
a day of better U.S. relations with Iran and saw the hostage issue
as one that could help lead to such a thaw. He said that while
Tehran clearly has influence over the captors, he is not certain the
Iranian government has clear control of the hostage situation.
   At the same time, Bush said there would be no change in the U.S.
policy against concessions or ransom to free hostages, a policy
Reagan declared but abridged during the arms sales. ``We are not
going to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostages,'' he
said.
   One gesture that could be made within that framework remains
pending but stalled. It is the standing U.S. offer of compensation
to the families of 290 people killed when a U.S. warship mistakenly
shot down an Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988.
   The State Department said the United States remains committed to
compensation payments, but that Iran has not provided information
about the families, data needed to determine payment levels and set
up a distribution system. The U.S. offer was to make payments
directly to families, not through the Iranian government.
   While the administration has barred concessions for hostage
release, it has said it is willing to talk with the captors.
   But there has been no direct contact, official or for hostage
families. That silence intensifies the frustration for Anderson's
colleagues who are, after all, communicators, accustomed to asking
questions, gaining information, getting answers.
   So when they gather, as at Thursday's fourth anniversary, they
deliver to one another their message to the captors, words that may
find a way to the faction holding Anderson in Beirut.
   They say that holding Anderson and the other hostages is no way
to tell a story but is, instead, damaging the Moslem image. They say
that kidnappers keep out reporters who would otherwise come to learn
and tell others about Lebanon.
   They say that what is happening to Anderson and the others is so
unjust as to be unthinkable.
   ``This cannot continue,'' said Peggy Say, Anderson's sister.
``Enough, for God's sake. Enough.''

Sunday's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Chavez Mena, 49, a Christian Democrat. A youthful-looking
but uncharismatic lawyer and former foreign minister whose campaign
motto is, ``To live in peace is to live better.''
   The technocratic Chavez Mena represents th conservative wing of
his party and generally is accepted as the ``U.S. candidate,'' a man
who will continue the programs of outgoing President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, a U.S. ally.
   He answers charges of party corruption by saying he represents a
cleansing new leadership.
   He says he will seek a negotiated settlement with leftist
guerrillas, privatization of some state companies, and a free-market
economy. Also proposes new social programs to improve medical care
and housing for the needy.
   Polls show him running second, but it may be a strong enough
second to force a runoff.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
      Alfredo Cristiani, 41, of the conservative Republican Nationalist
Alliance, known as Arena. He is a Georgetown University graduate in
business administration.
   This political newcomer is a a millionaire coffee grower who
opponents say is a front man for Roberto D'Aubuisson, the man often
accused of organizing right wing death squads. D'Aubuisson denies
the charge.
   Cristiani says he will offer the guerrillas a chance to join the
political process or face a ``professional, efficient army.''
   He wants an open economy to generate jobs. He says he will reduce
public spending and help women and children.
   He often expresses resentment of economic and social programs he
says were imposed by the United States.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
      Guillermo Ungo, 57, of the leftist Democratic Convergence. A
Social Democrat who spent seven years in exile leading a party
closely allied to the leftist guerrillas.
   He returned in late 1987. Despite the rebel call for an election
boycott, they say his participation is valid.
   Ungo considers peace the main issue and supports a negotiated
settlement with the guerrillas.
   He wants a non-aligned foreign policy, redistribution of income
and an economy geared to solving social problems.
   He is running third in the polls and acknowledges Arena probably
will lead the first round of voting. But he says his party will be
pivotal in a runoff and hopes to use its leverage to force political
change.

<HEAD>Tourism, Convention Industry Threatened by ``Murder Capital'' Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Muneer Deen in 2nd graph is correct.</HEAD>

   Travel industry leaders are worried that
visitors who bring an estimated $2 billion a year in tourism and
convention spending to Washington may start shunning shun the city
because its distinction as the nation's capital is being
overshadowed by its image as the nation's ``murder capital.''
   ``We're very concerned about it,'' said Muneer Deen, president of
the Washington Hotel Association. ``Some of the associations are
calling us and saying, `What's going to happen to your city? Do we
have to cancel?' Another thing it might affect is the family traffic
in the summertime.''
   Deen said the hotel association is embarking on a major public
relations and advertising effort to assure potential tourists the
District of Columbia is a safe place to visit.
   As of midday Friday, 113 people had been killed in the city so
far this year _ many the victims of drug turf wars.
   The American Bankers Association, which is sponsoring two major
meetings here this year, has contacted the Washington Convention and
Visitors Association to urge that action be taken to counter
negative national publicity.
   ``ABA is just trying to anticipate a potential problem and
prevent it,'' said association spokesman Mark Serepca. ``The problem
would be a decline in our conference attendance. We haven't seen any
yet.''
   Leaders of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, a regional
chamber of commerce, have begun studying the problem, a spokeswoman
said.
   Federal drug czar William J. Bennett announced this week that the
district may be a laboratory for testing ways to attack the nation's
drug problem.
   ``We're very encouraged with Mr. Bennett's announcement that
he'll make the city a model for his program,'' said Deen. ``That's a
very positive thing he did.''
   But some people in the travel business believe tourists will keep
coming to the District of Columbia despite its flagging image.
   ``Thus far, there's been no impact on the tourism industry,''
said Marie Tibor, director of tourism at the convention and visitors
association. She said tourism went up 3 percent in 1988, a year in
which a record 372 homicides were committed.
   ``Washington is not going to get hurt as far as the tourism
business, even though its PR (public relations) is at the lowest ebb
it's ever been,'' said Dan Bohan, owner of Omega World Travel, which
has 120 agencies nationwide.
   ``Most visitors are coming to the capital for some specific
reason _ they're either politically motivated, or they're bringing
school groups, or something,'' he explained. ``It's a destination
city versus just a convention city.''
   Other cities' problems _ gang wars in Los Angeles, riots in Miami
and the high crime rate in Los Angeles _ have been more damaging,
but the District of Columbia, with its monuments and the federal
government's presence, has unique appeal, Bohan said.
   ``I think they realize the victims of the murder rate are not
visitors to the district,'' he said.
   However, Bohan said he does see a trend in which many tourists
are choosing to stay in hotels in the adjacent suburbs of Virginia
and Maryland rather than downtown.
   Charles Tampio, vice president of the Crystal City, Va.-based
Close Up Foundation, which organizes high school trips to
Washington, said the city's problems haven't changed the group's
plans but have aroused parents' fears.
   ``Parents are concerned. That's what we have to deal with,'' he
said. Close Up brought 25,000 young people here last year.
   ``We show them all of Washington. We don't try to hide
Washington's warts,'' said Tampio. ``We want to show them that
Washington, besides being the home to the federal government, is a
real American city with all of its problems and possibilities.''

<HEAD>Prison Furlough Programs Provide Some Rewards and Considerable Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The case of an Indiana inmate charged
with murdering his former wife during a brief prison furlough
reflects rising concern in many states for striking the right
balance between rehabilitation and public safety.
   Gov. Evan Bayh suspended the furlough program that released Alan
L. Matheney hours before Lisa M. Bianco, 29, was beaten to death
March 4 outside her northern Indiana home.
   Bayh says the program may never be restored and directed seven
prison officials to face disciplinary hearings.
   Most state prisons allow limited inmate furloughs, brief periods
of freedom ranging from a few hours to a week when prisoners can
look for a job, visit a relative, get a medical exam or attend a
funeral. Thousands of other prisoners work day jobs and return to
prison at night.
   ``These people are going to get out eventually,'' says
Pennsylvania prisons spokeswoman Iris Crumbly. ``We're preparing
them, easing them out, getting them re-acclimated to living in the
community.''
   A furlough can be a payoff, too, for an inmate who doesn't make
trouble. ``It's a reward for good behavior and adherence to
discipline,'' says Francis Archibald, a spokesman for South
Carolina's prison department.
   A few states, such as Illinois and Nevada, don't allow furloughs
or work release. Other states, including Oregon and Georgia, have
turned to extended furloughs and early release to relieve prison
overcrowding.
   The system appears to work smoothly, most of the time.
   Florida runs an extensive furlough program, granting 5,658
work-release permits and 14 compassionate furloughs last September
alone. Only one inmate failed to return. Missouri reports 99.9
percent of inmates furloughed in 1988 obeyed the rules and committed
no new crimes.
   Indiana has become only the latest in a growing number of states,
however, that are tightening the rules on furloughs, or eliminating
some programs entirely. Even the very few failures may shatter
public confidence, threaten political careers and end lives.
   Willie Horton, the furloughed Massachusetts inmate who terrorized
a Maryland couple and became a political battering ram in George
Bush's presidential campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, is merely the best-known of those failures. There are
others:
   _In the Indiana case, Matheney, 38, had been sentenced to eight
years for beating Ms. Bianco in 1987, two years after their divorce,
and she had become a counselor and advocate for battered women.
Prison officials knew of Matheney's continued hostility toward her,
but failed to warn Ms. Bianco, as promised, of his release.
   In an interview videotaped by prosecutors two years ago, a badly
bruised Ms. Bianco said Matheney had threatened to ``make my life so
miserable that I would wish daily that I was dead.''
   ``I bartered for my life yesterday and told him that I would not
prosecute,'' she continued. ``I'm afraid if he does get ahold of me
again that I'm not going to be able to talk about it.''
   Matheney will face the death sentence if convicted.
   _In Louisiana, prison trusty Wesley Dyson Jr. was charged with
shooting to death his girlfriend during a weekend release in August
1988. Dyson was serving a life sentence for killing his wife in 1982.
   _In Seattle, businesswoman Diane Ballasiotes was slain last
September by work-release inmate Gene Raymond Kane Jr. Kane, whom
psychiatrists had described years earlier as a sexual psychopath,
was sentenced to life without parole.
   _In Las Vegas, a judge gave Edward Beets, 29, a 48-hour furlough
from a trespass and battery jail sentence to attend the funeral of
an aunt. Beets now is charged in the March 10 hammering death of
Oretha Hames, 71, and the attempted murder of her daughter _ Beets'
girlfriend _ Vanita Hames, 28.
   ``Should I punish everyone in the future because this man did
something horrible?'' asked Las Vegas Municipal Judge Gary Davis,
who granted the furlough. ``It was a kindness to (Beets') family
that turned into a nightmare.''
   Prison officials say inmates are carefully screened before
furloughs are granted. But murderers are eligible in several states,
including Missouri. A Utah rapist won work release and was charged
again with rape. A Delaware murderer was granted weekend passes,
although rules forbade it.
   Even inmates with clean prison records can be unpredictable.
``After all, they are prisoners,'' says Oklahoma prison spokesman
Jerry Massie. ``They have been convicted of crimes against society.''
   Some states have clamped down on furloughs and early releases
after well-publicized crimes, while others have taken similar steps
to avoid borrowing trouble.
   Dukakis tightened furlough rules after the 1987 Horton case,
choosing not to eliminate either that program or work release.
   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer implemented tougher policies since
Dyson was charged. The new standards would have kept Dyson, who won
an exception because he was assigned to the governor's mansion,
under guard. The old policy treated furloughs ``as some kind of
reward for service within the institution,'' Roemer said. ``To me,
that's not valid.''
   Maryland's Patuxent Institution, a psychiatric center, came under
criticism when it was revealed one triple murderer had regular
furloughs, and a convicted rapist was charged with rape while on
work release. Patuxent suspended all furlough and work-release
programs in November.
   Five years ago, Missouri sharply cut furloughs after two
furloughed inmates were charged with a series of rapes in St. Louis.
St. Louis Circuit Attorney George Peach, a critic of the program,
says he still worries, despite more stringent regulations.
   ``All I can say is that we haven't recently had a front-page
story of a furlough guy committing a crime,'' Peach says. ``I think
that's probably luck.''

<HEAD>Shamir Looks to Jewish Solidarity Show for Backing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, hoping to
strengthen his hand before an upcoming trip to Washington, is
bringing together Jewish leaders from 30 countries Monday in a show
of Jewish solidarity.
   Critics say the meeting of 1,100 Jewish leaders will boost
Shamir's hard-line views at a time when many Jews are criticizing
Israel's harsh treatment of rioting Palestinians.
   The three-day meeting in Jerusalem is to close at the Western
Wall, Judaism's holiest shrine, with an expected declaration of
support for a strong, peace-seeking Israel.
   It is billed as a non-partisan show of support for the Jewish
state rather than for any specific foreign policy line, including
Shamir's refusal to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The Israeli leader plans to visit Washington in April and is
expected to come under increasing pressure from U.S. officials to
produce new ideas for a peace initiative.
   Washington recently launched a dialogue with the PLO, and
Secretary of State James Baker III said Tuesday that Israel may have
no alternative but to reverse its policy and negotiate with the
guerrillas it calls terrorists.
   Shamir, 73, reiterated in an interview published Friday in
Jerusalem that he will never talk to the PLO, and rejects giving up
the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank in exchange for peace _ a
concept at the heart of U.S. Middle East policy.
   Cabinet Minister Mordechai Gur, a Labor Party leader helping to
organize the conference, said the meeting will not be used to
legitimize or boost Shamir's right-wing positions. Gur's
left-of-center party is a partner in the national unity government
headed by Shamir of the Likud bloc.
   ``It is not going to be a Shamir conference; it is not going to
be a Likud conference. It is going to be a Jewish conference in
support of the state of Israel, of the government of the state of
Israel,'' said Gur, who has no portfolio.
   Like a small number of other Labor ministers, Gur has publicly
supported talks with the PLO under certain conditions.
   Ehud Olmert, the Cabinet minister in charge of Arab affairs who
is from Likud, said the conference was called precisely because
there are divisions among Israelis and Jews outside the country
about the peace process.
   ``We believe it is important at this particular time to reaffirm
solidarity for the state of Israel. There will not be any specific
resolution calling for support for a particular policy line,'' he
said.
   Israel has faced mounting international criticism because of
harsh methods the army uses to suppress the Palestinian revolt
against Israeli occupation, now in its 16th month.
   At least 395 Palestinians have been killed during the uprising,
most from Israeli army gunfire. Seventeen Israelis also have died.
   Some Jewish circles also are critical. A recent poll conducted by
the American Jewish Committee showed American Jews still support
Israel but they are embarrassed by its actions against Palestinian
rioters.
   A spokesman for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, a New
York-based Jewish service organization, said the conference is
designed to counter the impression that criticism of Israel by Jews
means they have abandoned support for the state.
   ``We believe that too many enemies of Israel ... have mistaken
the open communal discussion of Israel's current difficulties and
the legitimate differences within our own community as a withdrawal
of our general support for Israel,'' it says in a statement to be
published in Sunday's Jerusalem Post.
   Among leaders expected at the conference are Morris Abrams,
former head of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations, and Rabbi Alexander Schindler, a leader of America's
Reform Jews.
   Among critics are Michael Lerner, editor of the American liberal
Jewish magazine ``Tikkun,'' who charged those gathering in Jerusalem
will be ``dancing to Shamir's tune,'' and Colin Schindler, editor of
the London-based ``Jewish Quarterly,'' who voiced similar criticism.
   ``History will judge that the Americans coming to Israel next
week betrayed the Jewish people when it needed to hear sober words
of truth,'' Lerner wrote in the Jerusalem Post.

<HEAD>Taking Harlem Kids Out To The Old Ballgame</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It has been a two-decade off-season for Little
League baseball in Harlem, where the crack of the bat has given way
to crack cocaine and gun shots.
   But that is to change April 8, with an Opening Day parade to a
city park for four games.
   ``We're not out trying to grow big-league ballplayers. We're
trying to grow big-league citizens,'' says W. Dwight Raiford, who
along with his wife, Iris, is the guiding light behind the
renaissance of Harlem Little League.
   Raiford's organization already has its charter from the
Williamsport, Pa.-based Little League Baseball Inc., which is
celebrating its 50th anniversary this year with 7,000 leagues
worldwide and 2.5 million youths.
   The community on the north end of Manhattan is so starved for
recreation for its children that Harlem Hospital, which treats
growing numbers of youths for stab and gunshot wounds, is lending
financial and medical support.
   ``You can walk out of the hospital at night and hear the `pop pop
pop' of guns,'' said Dr. Barbara Barlow, the hospital's chief of
pediatric surgery.
   ``A lot of the street-selling of crack is done by youngsters and
they're armed. Kids shoot at each other if they get angry or in a
fight. With so many violent episodes, it's like war in the
streets,'' she said.
   In Harlem, one of every 100 children is hospitalized with a
serious injury each year, 10 times the national average, the doctor
said.
   And 12 percent of the major injuries to children last year were
gunshot wounds, compared with the two children treated for gunshot
wounds at the hospital in the 1960s, she said.
   Frustrated, hospital officials began recreation programs. They
considered starting a Little League program themselves but the
Raifords did it first.
   Jack Laughlin, administrator of Little League's New York District
23, said a Harlem-Hudson Little League started in 1958 but disbanded
by about 1970. The reasons are unclear.
   Mrs. Raiford said she began planning the new league last fall
after striking a deal with her 8-year-old son, Joshua. She would
start a league if Joshua practiced piano with minimal complaints.
   She prepared an $8,000 budget so as many as 120 boys and girls
could play, and recruited sponsors to pay for the teams and
equipment for at least one year.
   Half the kids cannot afford a $25 fee and others lack gloves,
Raiford said, but ``thanks to our sponsors and a strong financial
aid program, any kid who can't afford the registration fee still
plays baseball.''
   Formation of the Harlem League, one of seven leagues in
Manhattan, has brought dozens of letters to the Raifords and nearly
100 phone calls.
   ``Harlem has its image,'' Mrs. Raiford said. ``When you think of
New York City, you think of it as very cold and people uncaring. But
we have seen the best side of New York City. You read letters and
tears come to your eyes.''
   One 77-year-old woman on Social Security wrote a letter praising
the effort, ``especially with so much drugs and crime out there,''
and promising to send a check, Raiford said.
   ``I told her to send us her prayers,'' he said. ``I think she did
because other people have come through.''
   Among the most interested have been the children, including
11-year-old George Salter. He said he's excited about wearing
uniforms ``because you'll be playing and knowing you're playing for
fun and you're appreciated.''
   Akhnaten Spencer-El, 9, said the ball fields will be a nice
alternative to the streets, where ``some people are a little crazy.''

   A woman being held hostage in her apartment by
her ex-boyfriend, who was armed with a gun and a grenade, sent her
6-year-old son to school with a note asking his teacher for help.
   Police rescued Sandra Lewis and arrested the gunman with their
own ruse: a detective posing as the school principal called the
house saying the first-grader was sick and needed to be picked up.
   When Ms. Lewis and Charles Scott walked out of the apartment
Friday, 25 police officers arrested Scott without a struggle. Inside
the apartment, police found a 9mm gun, ammunition and marijuana.
   Scott was charged with unlawful imprisonment, menacing and
possession of the weapons and drugs, Capt. Joseph Hardiman said.
Police said Scott entered Ms. Lewis' apartment Thursday afternoon,
apparently angry over an assalt charge she had filed against him on
Feb. 11.

   Syrian soldiers set up mortars and rocket
launchers on rooftops in the Moslem sector Saturday after the
commander of the Christian army vowed to drive the Syrian army out
of Lebanon.
   Sporadic artillery fire resounded across Beirut on Saturday as
Syrian-backed Druse gunners fired into the state-run Beirut Port and
Christian residential neigborhoods near the city's dividing Green
Line.
   Police said three people were wounded.
   The hostilities violated a cease-fire called Thursday to give
mediators a chance to end fighting that began 10 days ago, killing
49 people and wounding 164, by police count. The truce was to expire
at midnight Saturday.
   The fighting between Moslem and Christian forces began after Gen.
Michel Aoun, the commander of the Christian army, blockaded illegal
ports used by Moslem militias to import supplies.
   The Syrians on Saturday deployed mortars and rocket launchers
atop high-rise apartment buildings in outlying residential districts
of west Beirut and the Shiite Moslem southern slums. They apparently
were preparing for a resumption of the fighting when the truce ends.
   The Syrians maintain a 12,000-strong contingent in west and south
Beirut, part of 40,000 troops stationed in north, east and central
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Reliable witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Syrians also were digging artillery gun pits and foxholes and
erecting new sandbag positions in and around the southern suburbs.
   ``You should not panic,'' one Syrian officer told a visibly
worried resident while the reinforcements were being brought in.
``We're not going to start any fighting. We are here to protect
you.''
   However, hundreds of Shiite residents were seen packing luggage,
beds and mattresses, and leaving the slums on the outskirts of the
capital in cars heading for south Lebanon.
   U.N. officials, who requested anonymity, said more than 8,000
Shiites from Beirut have taken refuge with relatives living in areas
policed by the United Nations peacekeeping forces.
   ``We do not need a guardian who claims he is protecting us ...
while in reality he is killing us, sponging away our wealth and
usurping our sovereignty,'' Aoun said Friday.
   ``Our option is liberation. We shall fight and use every other
means to bring about the Syrian withdrawal,'' said Aoun, 53, a
Maronite Catholic who commands 20,000 mostly Christian troops in
Lebanon's fractured army.
   His remark was criticized by acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
pro-Syrian official who heads the mainly Moslem cabinet competing
for legitimacy with the Christian military cabinet under Aoun.
   ``You are planting war but you are not going to reap any
liberation,'' said Hoss, a Sunni Moslem. ``The Syrians are here at
the request of legitimate authorities, and their departure can be
decided only by a united cabinet.''
   Their remarks appeared to dim the chances of an agreement to
resolve the latest round of fighting in the 14-year-old civil war.

<TEXT>
   Bulldozers and rescue workers searched
through rubble Saturday for two teen-age girls feared buried in the
collapse of a 900-year-old tower.
   Two people were killed and 15 injured when the 255-foot tower
crumbled onto a square in this northern Italian town Friday morning.
   The search for the two girls began after they were reported
missing by their parents. They had failed to show up for work or
return home Friday.
   Throughout the night, bulldozers, firefighters and volunteer
rescue workers dug through the tons of bricks and dirt. Authorities
said the clean-up operation would last through the weekend.
   The tower destroyed a newspaper stand, buried several parked cars
and damaged adjoining shops and parts of the adjacent 501-year-old
cathedral.
   Experts said natural decay of the mortar cementing the bricks
likely caused the collapse. However, heavy August rains that damaged
the church and a recent three-month dry spell that may have weakened
ground around the tower are also being considered as possible causes
for the collapse.
   A magistrate was investigating whether negligence was involved.
   Culture Ministry officials and other departments dealing with
preservation of monuments will meet in Pavia next week to examine
the causes of the collapse and determine measures for preventing
similar incidents.

   With Discovery safely back on Earth,
NASA will move forward on its ambitious launch schedule by taking
Atlantis to the launch pad Wednesday for an April 28 liftoff with
the first space shuttle planetary payload.
   Magellan, a 7,600-pound spacecraft that resembles a giant insect,
will be dispatched by Atlantis' crew for a 466-day outward journey
to Venus. The probe is to orbit the cloud-shrouded planet and map
its surface with high-resolution radar.
   Discovery's successful launch last Monday with a communications
satellite was the first of seven shuttle flights planned this year
as the space agency continues its recovery from the 1986 Challenger
explosion, working toward a flight rate of 12 a year by 1992.
   Shuttle boss Richard Truly said after Discovery's return from
space on Saturday that ``our goal is to fly again and again,'' with
safety always a prime consideration.
   He said Discovery returned in better condition than any other
shuttle and that bodes well for maintaining a vigorous launch
schedule.
   ``It shows again what a marvelous and capable vehicle this is,''
Truly said.
   It also demonstrates, he said, that NASA has the capability of
flying a busy and safe launch rate.
   One stumbling block in the shuttle schedule may be the extensive
modifications being made to Columbia, the first shuttle in the
fleet, Truly said. That shuttle's July 1 target launch date with a
classified military payload already has slipped about two weeks.
   Any additional delay could push back another military shuttle
flight planned in August, and that could begin impacting the
high-priority October launch of Atlantis with the Galileo probe to
Jupiter.
   ``We want very much to launch Columbia in July,'' Truly said.
``If not, we'll delay it to meet the Galileo window.''
   Magellan and Galileo are high-priority missions because there is
only a month or so every two years when their planetary targets are
in the proper alignment for a launch.
   The space agency also is conscious that no American spacecraft
has been launched toward the planets since 1978.
   Here's the present launch schedule for this year:
   April 28 _ Atlantis, with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft.
   Mid-July _ Columbia, with a Defense Department payload.
   Mid-August _ Discovery with a Defense Department payload.
   Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, with the Galileo-Jupiter spacecraft.
   Nov. 13 _ Columbia, whose crew is to deploy a communications
satellite and retrieve for return to Earth a scientific satellite
orbiting since 1984.
   Dec. 11 _ Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Ten flights are scheduled in 1990.

   A twin-engine plane crashed and
exploded at an airport when it tried to avoid another aircraft while
landing, an official said. All three people aboard the plane were
reported killed.
   The private King-Air plane was landing at an airport in
southeastern Brazil when the pilot saw the second aircraft taxiing
on the same runway, airport spokesman Pulcimar Agusta said in a
telephone interview.
   Pilot Roberto Goncalves radioed the second pilot and tried to
take off again, but the plane flipped over, Agusta said. The
accident occurred in Juiz de Fora, 135 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   ``The plane burst into flames and exploded moments after it
crashed,'' Agusta said. ``All that was left was ashes.''
   In addition to the pilot, the crash killed Ronaldo Carneiro da
Rocha and his wife Elizabeth, both Brazilians, the spokesman said.
   The plane was arriving on a flight from Rio.

   Discovery's astronauts generally toed
the line on a new NASA edict to cut the comedy, at least for public
viewing, but they showed some flashes of fun in space, mainly in the
battle of wakeup songs.
   When Discovery made the first post-Challenger flight last
September, the five astronauts awoke to Beach Boys music parodies
and clowned for television cameras in bright Hawaiian shirts.
   And even though the December flight of Atlantis was a classified
military mission, word leaked of special wakeup music not
particularly flattering to the Pentagon.
   And both crews videotaped themselves playing in the
weightlessness of orbit, turning somersaults, throwing a football
and feeding each other candy. The tapes were shown at public
gatherings.
   The astronauts' wacky wakeup calls and zany acrobatics got
attention, which upset NASA because it felt the reports made the
flights look like all play and no work.
   ``We've learned that if you crack a joke or show somebody doing
something funny, that's the 10 seconds that gets on the evening
news, and not the two hours worth of work you just showed,''
Discovery commander Michael Coats said in a pre-launch interview.
   So space agency officials told Discovery's crew to cool it when
the cameras or microphones were on.
   ``NASA has no officia sense of humor anymore,'' said Bob
Springer, one of Coats' crewmates. ``So we're somewhat restricted
now on what we can do.''
   Discovery's flight started out strictly following the policy,
with wakeup calls played by Mission Control limited to presentations
like the Marine hymn, for the two crewmen who are Marines.
   But on Day 3, things loosened up.
   The astronauts pre-empted Mission Control by playing their own
wakeup music first _ the theme music from ``Star Trek.''
   They followed that with a tape recorded for them by actor William
Shatner, who gave a brief performance in his character of Capt.
James T. Kirk in the ``Star Trek'' movies and television series.
   ``Discovery, tell Scotty to beam me up,'' replied capsule
communicator David Low in Houston.
   Mission Control then responded with its planned wakeup _ a medley
of school songs from the alma maters of the crew members.
   The next day, the astronauts again were first in the wakeup
battle _ broadcasting a recording of ``Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It's Off To
Work We Go,'' the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated
movie classic ``Snow White.''
   Mission Control regained the upper hand on the final day,
Saturday, hitting the airwaves first with a raucus recording of the
astronauts' children shouting such things as, ``Get up, dad, get out
of bed and get to work,'' and ``Hi, daddy, this is your darling
daughter telling you to wake up.''

<TEXT>
   Few residents of this city in northeast Ohio
remember a fair-haired boy named Terry Anderson, who played at his
parents' home while his father worked at a local steel mill.
   But 30 years later, many in the city of 75,000 claim Anderson as
one of their own as they work to free him from captivity in Lebanon.
   ``The city of Lorain has a soft spot in its heart for any Lorain
native,'' said Jack LaVriha, chairman of the Free Terry Anderson
Committee. ``The Andersons are a deep-rooted family here. Terry's
grandfather had a grocery store in south Lorain, and his dad worked
in the steel mills.''
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of nine American hostages in Lebanon. He
began his fifth year in captivity Thursday.
   Anderson's parents are dead, but he still has relatives in
Lorain, an industrial city 30 miles east of Cleveland on Lake Erie.
   The house where Anderson lived until he was 6 or 7 years old has
been torn down, as has the school where he went to first grade, said
Gwen Jones, 78, Anderson's aunt.
   The family left that house when Anderson's father, Glenn, left
the steel mills to work as a truck driver and moved the family to
Batavia, N.Y.
   While LaVriha said he is unaware of any Lorain resident other
than Mrs. Jones who has seen Anderson in the past 30 years, that
hasn't stopped Lorain residents from working on Anderson's behalf.
   Last Christmas, the committee gathered 28,000 Christmas cards for
Anderson that were sent to the State Department with the hope that
the greetings might reach Lebanon. Some of them were published in a
Beirut newspaper.
   Every Oct. 28, residents hold a party in honor of Anderson's
birthday. On March 16 they gather in remembrance of the day he was
captured in 1985, LaVriha said.
   ``The committee has done a lot of work to keep his name alive,''
said a cousin of Anderson's, Leila Arden, 45, who said she hasn't
seen him since he moved from Lorain. ``They've done a lot of work in
making him one of our own.''
   About 500 people wore yellow ribbons, heard music written in
Anderson's honor and released hundreds of balloons Thursday at City
Hall to symbolize their hope that Anderson will be released. More
than 100 of those attending were members of six veterans'
organizations, said another of Anderson's cousins, James Anderson,
vice commander of a local Veterans of Foreign Wars post.
   ``If you are a native of Lorain, whether a veteran or not, we
would have been there,'' he said. ``But Terry's being a Marine and a
veteran of Vietnam makes him kind of special.''
   Lorain native Richard Bacher, who has never met Anderson, wrote a
song called ``We Want You Home Again'' in Anderson's honor last
December. The song, recorded by the Lorain High School Choir,
implores Anderson's captors to ``listen to our plea and send him
home.''
   LaVriha said it has been broadcast by more than 80 U.S. radio
stations and by the Voice of America overseas.
   He said the committee will continue to work to free Anderson.
   ``The main thing is to keep this thing alive. Once we forget the
hostages, they'll be gone,'' LaVriha said.

   A judge has ruled that a $25 million palimony
lawsuit filed against Jerry Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers,
will go to trial.
   Puppi Buss, also known as Marsha Lee Osborne, claims a monetary
interest in the Lakers; the Lakers' arena, the Great Western Forum;
and Los Angeles Kings, the hockey team once owned by Buss, accrued
during the 16 years or more she spent as Buss' companion,
confidante, homemaker and business partner.
   Superior Court Judge Vernon Foster ruled Friday that ``a triable
issue is created by her declaration that for certain services,''
Buss agreed to share property and to provide her with lifetime
support. The trial was set for July 31.
   Buss' contends that he had never lived with Ms. Buss or promised
to take care of her, that they never owned property jointly, that
they did not travel together regularly and that he did not agree
that she could use his name.

   Singer Bruce Hornsby has reached an
agreement to purchase a 33-acre tract from Colonial Williamsburg, a
foundation dedicated to preserving the colonial capital.
   Hornsby, who is from Williamsburg, and his wife, Kathy, will
build a home on the undeveloped site, which they are purchasing for
$1.2 million, said foundation spokesman Albert O. Louer.
   ``There's no way we could use it for educational purposes,''
Louer said. Archaeological surveys have found some evidence of past
use by humans, but nothing significant, he said.
   The sales contract carries several restrictions on how the wooded
site may be developed, in order to preserve its character, said
Charles Longworth, the foundation's president. The site is a couple
of miles south of the restored village that is a popular tourist
attraction.
   Hornsby, who weaves Virginia imagery into many of his songs, won
a Grammy award in 1987 for best new artist. He and his band, the
Range, are known for the albums ``The Way It Is'' and ``Scenes from

   Joe Clark, whose tough-love brand of
leadership at an inner-city high school made headlines and inspired
a Hollywood movie, is taking a leave of absence from his job and
says he might not return after it's done.
   Clark said Friday that he is in preliminary negotiations with
federal drug czar William Bennett concerning a job in Washington.
   ``Regardless of the outcome, I have decided to take a sabbatical
beginning in September 1989,'' Clark said. His plans include writing
a second book, developing educational videos and increasing his
lecture schedule.
   In an interview with the New York Daily News, he said that ``I
could come back after the year respite, but I would say it's
extremely unlikely.''
   ``My soul is tired and fatigued from fighting an educational
system that's rotten to the core.''
   Clark, who is portrayed in the current hit movie ``Lean on Me,''
has battled with the Paterson school board over his work at Eastside
High School. He was accused of ousting many low-performing students
without following board rules and of creating a safety hazard by
locking doors to keep out drug dealers.
   Earlier this month, he was suspended for five days over a school
assembly featuring a dancer who stripped her male partners down to
G-strings. He was not present and said the performance was done
without his knowledge.
   Bennett, who was secretary of education in the Reagan
administration before becoming head of President Bush's anti-drug
efforts, helped draw attention to Clark last year when he praised
his get-tough theories of school discipline.

   Rebels say they will not stop
Salvadorans from voting in Sunday's presidential election, but none
of the voting-age residents in this village of 2,500 plans to cast a
ballot.
   ``No one here believes in this election,'' said Rodrigo Lainez, a
local leader of this town, which was repopulated in 1987 after being
abandoned for seven years.
   ``This election is to prolong the war,'' said a man who
identified himself only as Victor.
   No love is lost between this town in north central Salvador and
the government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. His administration
and its army consider this, like others revived by people returning
from refugee camps in Honduras, as hostile territory.
   In an interview, a local rebel commander known only as
``Antolin'' said under no circumstances would voters be targets in
the guerrilla campaign to discredit the elections.
   But no election was scheduled in Santa Marta, where sympathies
clearly lie with the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation
front, which has waged a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed
government.
   The rebels have called for an election boycott to prove that a
political solution is impossible without their participation.
   Every day from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., radios in Santa Marta are tuned
to the rebels' Radio Farabundo Marti and Radio Venceremos.
   Women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee before
heading to the fields. On one morning this week, all listened to a
radio account of overnight attacks on ``the puppet army'' and
admonishments that every Salvadoran do his part to prepare for
insurrection.
   Guerrillas are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice.
   Government soldiers, on their rare appearances, are shunned.
   ``The soldiers three times set fire to the cornfields around
here,'' said Lainez. ``The last time they came through, a few went
up to people and told them, `Just wait until Arena is in power.
We'll be back with a bomb for every house.'''
   Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, is expected to win Sunday's election. In its
campaign, Arena has taken a hard line on the war, threatening a
military solution.
   In an attempt to disrupt voting on Sunday, rebels announced a
transportation strike that government officials said paralyzed more
than 90 percent of the nation's transport services. Rebels also
sabotaged utilities leaving much of the nation without power or
water for the past five days.
   The government has said soldiers will be stationed at polls to
guarantee voter safety.
   ``We will attack military objectives in the countryside, in the
cities and on the roads. But the people will never become a military
target,'' Antolin said from his mountain stronghold.
   ``If civilians are killed or wounded, they will be victims of
rightist terrorists trying to make us look bad,'' he said.
   But Santa Marta and at least 23 other rebel-controlled towns
residents were to follow the rebel lead and boycott polls Sunday.
Col. Jose Herrarte, provincial military commander, said support for
the guerrillas was firmly entrenched in Santa Marta.
   ``The subversives count on them for supplies, recruitment and
rest,'' he said. ``They portray us only as murderers, violators of
human rights, ogres.''
   An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans were driven from their homes by
the war, aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s.
Since October 1987, about 6,500 have returned.
   ``When we came back, this was just woods and brush,'' said
Lainez. ``Every house had been burned, and the fields were
overgrown.''
   Now many people are enlarging their homes and working cooperative
farms.
   ``Because of the war, there are lots of widows and orphans
here,'' said Lainez. ``If we weren't a cooperative, those people
would die.''

<HEAD>The Surgeon General Has Determined That Apples Are Good For You</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release 6:30 p.m. EST; time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has joined
other federal health officials in trying to assure the public it is
safe for children to eat apples.
   ``I wish to send a message to mothers across the country: `It's
OK Mom, apples are good for your kids!''' Koop said in a statement
released by his office over the weekend.
   Last week, officials of the Food and Drug Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture
went to Capitol Hill in an effort to calm public fears over the
chemical Alar, used by some apple growers to retain the crispness of
their fruit.
   Many apple growers say they don't use Alar, which has been linked
to cancer in animal tests. But the industry is reeling from reaction
to a recent a private environmental group's report that youngsters
are at especially high risk from Alar because they eat so many more
apples than adults.
   Many parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to their
children and some school districts are no longer serving apples in
their cafeterias.
   Trying to allay their fears, Koop said that ``in 1988, only 5
percent of the apple crop was treated with Alar.''
   ``As Surgeon General, I support my colleagues in the federal
government and scientific community in the belief that it is safe to
eat apples,'' he said.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young has said that, even in those apples
containing Alar, the level is no more than 10 percent the level
found acceptable under EPA regulations.
   Public furor over the Alar controversy was intensified last week
by the unrelated ban of fruit from Chile because two grapes were
found to have been injected with cyanide.

<TEXT>
   China's legislature opens its annual meeting
Monday, and some observers expect a tough fight between delegates
calling for democratic change and government officials stressing
stability.
   The government argues that it needs stability to solve China's
pressing economic problems. Many intellectuals say the economic
problems will persist unless the government relaxes tight political
controls.
   Pro-democratic forces are expected to continue an open-letter
campaign, urging an amnesty for political prisoners and respect for
human rights.
   Since January, four such letters have been sent, signed by more
than 100 leading intellectuals. The last letter was sent last week,
despite threats of punishment by government officials.
   Delegates also said they expected the issue of human rights to be
raised at the congress itself, an unprecedented act of defiance.
   ``It will be a lively time,'' said one Communist Party member.
``Intellectuals will push as far as they can go.''
   Government officials have ordered the state-run media to censor
reports of disagreements at the 2,796-member National People's
Congress and portray the delegates as united, Communist Party
sources said.
   And the restrictions are apparently not limited to the domestic
press.
   On Friday night, Chinese authorites interrogated two Taiwanese
journalists after they had interviewed a delegate. Two teams of Hong
Kong reporters were also stopped from talking with delegates.
   Lu Zhichao, a government spokesman, apologized for the incidents,
but he said he could not assure it would not happen again.
   ``It will be a step back from last year,'' said one delegate.
   During last year's congress, the Chinese news media was allowed
to report some disagreements between delegates as part of the
state's attempt at openness.
   The government has been emphasizing that it needs stability to
solve China's weighty economic problems.
   By doing so, party sources said, China hopes to persuade wavering
delegates that it's best to remain quiet and follow the government
line.
   In an attempt at conciliation, the government has announced it
will appoint more members of democratic parties to government
positions. The first appointments were made Friday when
non-Communist Party members were appointed vice-minister of labor
and vice-minister of agriculture.
   Delegates said the appointments will be made to present an image
of democracy and to take some of the blame off the Communist Party
for failed policies.
   ``But it will fail,'' said one party member. ``All the delegates
know that the `democratic' parties are even more communist than the
Communist Party.''
   The congress is also expected to pass some laws, two of which are
critical to the reform of China's political system.
   One law gives civilians the right to sue the government. It has
been criticized by liberal thinkers because it does not acknowledge
that the government can break the law. But moderates have hailed it
as a step in the right direction.
   Another law delineates the powers of the congress, an important
step in reforms designed to separate the functions of the Communist
Party from the government.
   The congress opens against a backdrop of serious political and
economic problems.
   Inflation is running at a record 36 percent. Grain harvests have
been below target for the past five years. Electricity is in scarce
supply. Steel production has dropped. Salt and cotton are hard to
buy.
   Corruption among government officials and party members appears
at an all time high. Newspapers are filled with reports of official
malfeasance.

<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Tibetans, this is a place of crushed
hopes and cherished dreams, a sanctuary far from the Chinese who now
rule their homeland and close to their spiritual leader, the Dalai
Lama, himself an exile for 30 years.
   High in the Himalayan foothills of north India, with big brown
monkeys scampering across slate roofs and shaggy little terriers
yapping in muddy streets, Dharmsala is a way station for Tibetan
activists who fled from the Chinese, a storehouse of Tibetan
culture, a shrine for Buddhist pilgrims and a center for plotting
political strategies.
   Sonam Tobgyal, a 47-year-old man with hard eyes and a network of
scars across his thumbs and knuckles, left Tibet six weeks ago
because he thought the Chinese were on the verge of arresting him
for pro-independence activities.
   It was not fear of prison that made him leave, he said, but fear
of torture that might cause him to betray others who were not yet
under suspicion for organizing demonstrations or slipping
information to foreign travelers.
   ``I was getting known by the Chinese. One of my friends was
arrested,'' he said, seated in the sunshine on a rooftop terrace.
``I had to escape.''
   Tobgyal said he knew about torture from the 11 years he had
already spent in Chinese prisons in Tibet. Speaking through an
interpreter, he said the scars on his hands were the result of
beatings with wooden clubs and iron bars and being suspended by his
thumbs from the ceiling for 15 minutes to an hour at a time.
   He said he was released from prison in 1979 and started peddling
clothing from village to village, a job that enabled him to spread
news of upcoming anti-Chinese demonstrations.
   Dekey is a rosy-cheeked, angelic-faced 2-year-old who hugs
strangers exuberantly and demands to be cuddled.
   She was brought to Dharmsala from Lhoka, a town in southern
Tibet, a year ago by a mother who returned home to the rest of her
family and may never see Dekey again.
   Dekey is one of 1,449 children between the ages of 5 months and
18 years who live in the stone bungalows at the Tibetan Children's
Village on a ridge above Dharmsala. Some are orphans. Others have
parents, either in India who for reasons of health or poverty are
unable to care for their children, or in Tibet who smuggled them out
so that they might be brought up in the Tibetan culture they say is
being stifled by China.
   The children's village, like so many things in Dharmsala from the
Tibet Memory Restaurant to the Dalai Lama's Namgyal Monastery, is
dedicated to preserving Tibetan identity and _ above all _ the
struggle for a Tibetan nation.
   The Tibetans say they were never part of China, which invaded the
Himalayan feudal theocracy in 1950 and annexed it a year later.
China maintains Tibet has been an integral part of its territory for
centuries.
   Three decades ago a Tibetan uprising failed. The Dalai Lama,
fearing he would be killed or captured and his people left
leaderless, slipped out of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on March 17,
1959, and fled across the Himalayas to India, where 100,000 Tibetans
now live.
   He formed a government-in-exile in Dharmsala, home to about 7,000
of his fellow refugees.
   In June, he offered China control over Tibet's foreign policy and
the right to keep troops on Tibetan soil in exchange for allowing
Tibet to become ``a self-governing democratic political entity ...
in association with China.''
   The Chinese rejected the proposal but said they were willing to
talk to the Dalai Lama, although formal negotiations have not begun.
   It is a measure of Tibetans' faith in the Dalai Lama that many
people still believe he will win total freedom for Tibet, although
the Buddhist leader has said repeatedly, as he did again in an
interview last Thursday: ``I am trying to find a middle way. We are
not insisting on complete independence.''
   Nima Assae, a 51-year-old former resistance fighter who was
captured by the Chinese in 1961 and imprisoned for nearly two
decades, is one of the believers.
   ``I have full faith that the Dalai Lama will gain our
independence. The Chinese will not be able to terminate the
Tibetans,'' he said.

   A singing telegram entertainer getting out
of a helicopter to greet guests at a party lost two fingers to the
chopper's blade when she raised her hands to wave, a sheriff's
deputy said.
   Chanel Price, 31, of Venice was in stable condition Saturday at
UCLA Medical Center, recovering from the accident Friday night in
this ritzy, oceanfront colony, said Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner.
   Ms. Price was hired to entertain guests at a private St.
Patrick's party.
   ``After landing at the location, Price got out of the helicopter
and raised both hands in celebration,'' Wehner said. ``She had two
fingers on her left hand severed by the moving rotor blade.''
   The pilot put Ms. Price back into the helicopter and flew to a
gas station parking lot across the street from a medical clinic,
where she was treated before being taken to UCLA Medical Center. Her
severed fingers could not be found.

   Dana T. Myers showed up for his appointment Wednesday and was

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III favors
sending a special envoy to the Afghan rebels battling the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime as a means of broadening U.S. influence
among the long-feuding rebel factions, administration officials said
Saturday.
   ``It is under consideration,'' a White House official said of the
proposal.
   The official, who spoke on condition his name not be used, said
the proposal ``is still on Baker's desk'' and has not reached
President Bush.
   But Baker ``may be close to a decision point'' on the matter, the
official said.
   One State Department official, who also spoke privately, said the
proposal has been ``under consideration for a long time,'' but said
he was uncertain of the potential timing for a decision.
   The first official emphasized that the move would not imply U.S.
recognition of any interim government established by the rebels,
also known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   He confirmed the move is aimed at limiting Pakistan's influence
among the Afghan guerrillas, in particular it's backing of radical
Moslem fundamentalist rebels over more moderate factions.
   Throughout the war, the United States has funneled aid to the
rebels through Pakistan.
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help fight an
insurgency that began after a communist coup in 1978. The Red Army
withdrew under an agreement mediated by the United Nations.
   In recent weeks, the Soviet-backed Afghan government has been
battling a renewed offensive by the Moslem rebels in the wake of the
mid-February withdrawal of the Soviet Union's 115,000 soldiers.
   But last week the Soviets renewed arms shipments to Kabul, saying
they will continue to supply equipment to President Najib's troops
as long as Pakistan and the United States supply the guerrillas.
   Civil war has ravaged Afghanistan for more than 11 years and
divisions among the rebel units could prolong the fighting. The
seven main guerrilla groups are members of an alliance based in
Pakistan, but have been deeply divided as their leaders struggle for
power as they attempt to form a transitional regime leading to a
postwar Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Last year, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., pushed a law through
Congress that required the appointment of a special ambassador, but
former Secretary of State George Shultz only named a lower-ranking
envoy to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan to fill the post.
   On Friday, the Senate renewed the call for a higher-level
appointment in a bipartisan resolution.
   The resolution, which was referred to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, also said the United States should not cut the
amount of military equipment it gives the Afghan guerrillas until it
is ``absolutely clear'' that the Soviet Union has ended its
assistance to its proxies.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., authored the resolution, which was
signed by Senate majority leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
Senate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., among others.

<TEXT>
   Bringing philosophers, writers and psychologists
together to ponder the roots of hatred is not naive, it's a
necessity in this era of plastic explosives, skinheads and the furor
over ``The Satanic Verses,'' organizers of a new program say.
   ``Anatomy of Hate,'' a three-day seminar scheduled to begin
Sunday at Boston University, will tackle some tough questions and
diverse subjects _ from the threats against author Salman Rushdie
for his novel to the January riots in Miami.
   ``That's a very strong word _ hatred,'' said Nobel Prize-winning
humanitarian Elie Wiesel, whose foundation organized the event.
``Usually, all the conferences are for love and for compassion, and
I wanted to name the disease.
   ``And the disease is simple, concrete and conjugal, and it's
here, all around us. That's why I begin with the anatomy of hatred,
to explore it, to analyze it, to dissect it.''
   The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity has tentative plans to
hold other ``Beyond Hate'' gatherings this year and next year in
Israel, the Soviet Union, Paris and San Francisco. A PBS series with
Bill Moyers as host is also in the works.
   The foundation cites several positive events last year, the
cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran War, dialogue between the United States
and the Soviets, the Palestinian Liberation Organization's
recognition of Israel's right to exist, international cooperation in
rushing aid to earthquake-torn Armenia.
   But it also gives an example of violent hatred for every one of a
good event:
   _The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, four
days before Christmas.
   _Ethnic violence in Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   _The escalation of assaults and vandalism by racist ``skinhead''
groups in the United States.
   _Continuing strife between Roman Catholics and Protestants in
Northern Ireland.
   ``To ask why hate continues in the face of humanitarian
cooperation and political understanding is neither naive nor
utopian,'' the foundation said in a statement. ``It is a necessity.''
   ``In a world where global annihilation lies seconds away and the
technology of destruction, whether plastic explosives or nerve gas,
is readily available to a handful of extremists, the costs of hatred
are too high for the subject of hate not to be a topic of the
highest concern.''
   More than 25 professors, writers, psychologists and peace
advocates are scheduled to participate in the forum, including
Boston University President John Silber and Camelia Sadat, the
daughter of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   One of the participants, Krister Stendahl of the Harvard Divinity
School, said the religious aspect of hatred is a particularly
delicate issue.
   ``Religion is a very dangerous thing,'' Stendahl said. ``These
are enormous powers we are dealing with. My tasks are to ask why
there has been this dark side.''
   People who tend to see the world ``in a strongly adverse,
antagonistic form,'' Stendahl said, can ``easily play into the hands
of the patterns of hatred. The Arabic-Hebrew word `shalom' doesn't
actually mean `peace,' it means `harmony.' That's a non-hateful
image.''
   Wiesel, born in Romania 60 years ago, was deported along with his
family to the Auschwitz concentration camp when he was 15. His
mother and sister died there. He and his father were transferred to
Buchenwald, where his father died before the camp was liberated in
1945.
   Weisel won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for his international
work to foster human rights. He is the author of more than 30 books
and is a professor at Boston University.
   He said he hopes the seminars will explore the conditions that
transform negative attitudes into destructive behavior.
   ``How do you start to educate people? Without the education, the
hatred in the world has produced more hatred,'' he said.
   ``We will try to explore all aspects (of hatred),'' Wiesel said.
``With the Rushdie affair, it is very topical. The fanaticism
mounting, with the head of a world religion hiring hitmen, it's just
unheard-of. It's what hate can do.''

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops stood guard Saturday as Chile
resumed fruit exports after a poisoning scare caused a five-day
stoppage that idled thousands of workers and may cost the nation up
to $1 billion, officials said.
   Navy Capt. Patricio Urbina, head of the Valparaiso port, said two
ships were being loaded with 700,000 crates of grapes, apples, pears
and kiwis. He said navy troops were deployed around the clock to
watch over the shipments and access to the port was tightly
controlled.
   Twelve more ships were to be loaded over the weekend, the officer
said.
   The shipments ended a public health scare that began Monday when
U.S. health officials said they found traces of cyanide on two
Chilean grapes in the port of Philadelphia.
   But on Friday, President Bush lifted consumer warnings on Chilean
produce, announcing tougher security measures. Japan and Canada,
which had issued similar warnings, followed suit.
   Chilean authorities said economic effects of the virtual embargo
would be felt for years to come.
   The industry, which employs 500,000 workers and accounts for 10
percent of the nation's exports, may lose up to $1 billion,
government officials said.
   Manuel Feliu, president of the nation's largest business
association, said Chile had already lost $200 million, while
authorities said 200,000 fruit industry workers were laid off.
   The government on Friday announced economic measures to combat
the crisis, including a subsidized advertising campaign in the
United States designed to regain consumer confidence.
   Other measures included a $12 million emergency job program,
emergency credit lines to fruit exporters and producers and the
purchase of 1 million crates of stocked fruit.
   Under new security measures taking effect Monday, army patrols
were to be posted in fruit fields and at packing houses and police
were to step up security checks on trucks carrying produce to ports,
Urbina said.
   Officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also were to
join Chilean colleagues in reinforcing sanitary controls in ports
and fruit packing plants.
   In the United States, Japan and Canada, health officials were to
step up spot checks of Chilean produce. Initial checks of Chilean
fruit were made after embassies in Santiago received anonymous
threats that fruit from the South American nation would be poisoned.
The government attributed the calls to leftist terrorists.

   Two weeks into a strike against Eastern
Airlines, organized labor has succeeded beyond expectations in
crippling the carrier but has not, for a number of reasons, carried
out pre-strike threats to disrupt the rest of the nation's
transportation system.
   Support from the airline's pilots gave striking Machinists an
early and impressive boost in their bitter war with Eastern
management, and other unions have been equally impressive in their
support of the strikers, principally through attendance at rallies
and donations to strike funds.
   But as the strike enters its third week _ with Eastern all but
grounded and mired in bankruptcy court _ even many labor leaders
agree that their nemesis, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, is
the early winner because he is losing less money per day now on
Eastern than he was before the strike.
   But they say the lasting verdict is not yet in, and that the
strike has given labor's morale a much-needed boost.
   ``The strike is holding firm and I think it's a great show of
solidarity,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in an interview
Friday. ``The future of this airline under bankruptcy proceedings is
largely uncharted waters. But this man had this company on the
rocks, and when you're on the rocks, uncharted waters look much
better.''
   Unions representing Eastern workers marked the two week point of
the walkout Saturday with a rally across the street from the White
House, chiding President Bush for not intervening to block the
strike and promising continued solidarity.
   ``Our resolve is rock solid and so are our picket lines,'' said
Randy Babbitt of the Airline Pilot Association, which along with
Eastern's flight attendants union has been honoring pickets of
striking Machinists.
   As labor prepared for the strike, which began when 8,500 members
of the International Association of Machinists walked off the job
March 4, its plans included major disruptions of other airlines and
railroads through secondary pickets it believed would be honored by
union workers.
   But those efforts have been stymied by court injunctions in New
York and Washington prohibiting other unions from honoring pickets
of Eastern workers. They are appealing those rulings, but labor
leaders have not pressed further boycotts because they do not want
to endanger the public support the strikers have garnered.
   ``Everything we've done to date is legal, and I think the public
appreciates that and has been on our side,'' said IAM spokesman Jim
Conley.
   David Bensman, director of the Labor Studies Program at Rutgers
University, concurred with that view.
   ``If the unions had immediately succeeded in getting sympathy
strikes going and disrupting things I think the public might have
turned against the unions,'' Bensman said. ``Labor now has made its
case and painted Lorenzo as an irresponsible employer. I think that
has left labor in a strong position with the public if the strike is
expanded in the future.''
   For now, labor's goal is to keep Eastern virtually grounded _ the
airline has been able to fly roughly 10 percent of its pre-strike
schedule of 1,040 daily flights _ while pursuing a possible
employee-led buyout of the company and drafting a union
reorganization plan to counter any proposal Lorenzo submits to the
bankruptcy court.
   Labor's efforts so far have won praise from outsiders who follow
the movement, particularly iteling more powerful leads you to
act more powerfully,'' said Bensman. ``It seems to me what has
happened so far has been about as good as the unions could have
expected.''
   Lorenzo has been aided by the bankruptcy filing, the unions
concede, because it has stopped a financial drain on cash-poor
Eastern that was $1 million a day before the strike and several
times that in the days immediately following the walkout.
   ``In many ways he's already won,'' said Conley. ``He's taken
hundreds of million in assets from this airline and transferred them
to Continental and Texas Air.''
   But union leaders are encouraged by indications Lorenzo is trying
to sell the airline and by polls and other indications public
support is with the striking workers, who hope anti-Lorenzo
sentiment will affect non-union Continental, which has been losing
money nearly as fast as Eastern.
   Bensman said labor also has sent a powerful message throughout
the airline industry, where workers at several carriers have been
forced to accept wage concessions in recent years.
   ``If Lorenzo had succeeded here in splitting the Machinists from
the pilots and then imposing harsh concessions, it would have sent
the green light to management at other airlines,'' he said. ``Labor
has strengthened its position in the industry as a whole.''
   Peripheral to the strike itself has been a related political
debate and, much like Eastern's ultimate fate, the ramifications of
the strike in that context remain unclear.
   By refusing to block the walkout by naming an emergency mediation
board, Bush has soured his relations with labor. Congressional
Democrats, who benefit heavily from labor's political warchest, are
pushing legislation that would force Bush to intervene but do not
appear to have the votes to override a veto.
   Kirkland accused Bush of ``siding with a pirate'' by refusing to
intervene but said it was too soon to discuss the long-term impact
the strike would have on labor's relations with the new
administration. ``I'm still hopeful better judgment will prevail.''

   China on Saturday welcomed President Bush's
selection of James R. Lilley as ambassador to Beijing.
   Lilley, born in China to American parents, was a former
intelligence officer in Beijing and worked in U.S. missions in
Taiwan and Hong Kong. He was ambassador to South Korea from 1986
until January.
   The White House announced Lilley's appointment Wednesday to
replace Winston Lord, who has been ambassador since 1985.
   ``We welcome the appointment by the U.S. President of Mr. James
Lilley as the U.S. Ambassador to China,'' China's Foreign Ministry
said in a one-sentence statement Saturday.
   Lilley's previous stint in Beijing came while Bush was U.S.
liaison officer in the Chinese capital in 1974-75, before the two
countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979.

   Communist North Korea Saturday demanded
the United States and South Korea halt joint military exercises and
accused the U.S. Air Force of staging simulated nuclear attacks with
B-52 bombers on the Korean peninsula.
   U.S. officials denied North Korean charges as propaganda. U.S.
forces in South Korea are believed to have nuclear weapons, but
Washington has declined to confirm or deny such reports.
   Students in the South Korean capital Seoul and the southern city
of Kwangju battled police with firebombs and rocks Saturday to
demand an end to the ``Team Spirit'' exercises and an immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   Riot police fired tear gas to drive back about 800 protesters at
Chonnam University in Kwangju and about 400 students at Dongguk
University in the South Korean capital. Protesters in Seoul burned
an U.S. flag, shouting ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive out U.S.
forces!''
   Also Saturday, millions of Seoul commuters were stranded for a
third day as many subway workers remained on strike.
   North Korean delegates to the Military Armistice Commission said
the U.S. Air Force was using nine B-52 bombers from bases in Guam to
stage practice nuclear attacks in South Korean areas that resemble
potential targets in the communist North.
   The Armistice Commission, which meets at the border site of
Panmunjom, polices the truce that ended the Korean war in 1953.
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in the
14th annual exercises, which began Tuesday and end next week. ``Team
Spirit'' practices bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the event of a
North Korean attack.
   About 42,000 American soldiers are normally stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   North Korean officials said the exercises were a threat to peace
on the divided peninsula and barrier to peace talks.
   ``You should desist from attempting to justify your aggressive
acts and discontinue at once the criminal war exercise ... blocking
the way to detent and dialogue by leading the situation to the brink
of war,'' said North Korean Maj. Gen. Choe Ui Ung.
   U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Larry Vogt, head of the U.N. Command, said
the military exercises were purely defensive and vital to Seoul's
security.
   ``Your side's continued military build up, forward deployment of
forces and secret military maneuvers, all directed against South
Korea, cause serious concern that your side may be preparing for
another act of aggression,'' he said.
   North Korea has charged that Team Spirit is part of preparations
for a U.S. attack on its territory and demanded the exercises be
stopped. The exercises this year stalled talks between the two
Koreas on improving relations.
   North Korea has not said if it would be willing to resume the
talks after the exercises end.
   The U.N. Command represents the 16 nations that sent troops to
defend South Korea against a 1950 North Korean attack.
   Seoul Subway Corp. officials said about 80 percent of the
subway's 7,732 workers reported to work Saturday, but many refused
to do anything, ignoring a warning that they faced disciplinary
action.
   The subway workers walked out Thursday to demand the resignation
of their chief manager, Kim Myong-nong, even though an agreement was
reached on more pay and other conditions. They also demanded the
withdrawal of lawsuits against labor leaders who organized protests
last week.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam urged President Roh Tae-woo
Saturday to step down for failing to address abuses committed by his
authoritarian predecessor.
   Kim, speaking at a rally in the central city of Onyang, charged
that Roh lacked the ability to carry out reforms because of his ties
to former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chun, a former general who seized power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile in November after making an public
apology for misdeeds during his seven-year rule.

   An crowded boat sank off Sulawesi

Saturday.
   Rescuers saved nine people and were searching for 23 others, the

   Suara Pembaruan did not name the boat or give its size.
   The accident occurred when rough waves rocked the boat as its

<TEXT>
   The supersecret National Security Agency has
ordered the construction of its own computer chip manufacturing
plant, defense officials said Saturday.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said that ``in
September 1988 National Semiconductor Corp. received an $85 million
contract to construct and operate a microelectronics facility for
the U.S. government over a period of 45 months.''
   A Defense Department official, who spoke on condition that he not
be identified, confirmed that the plant was to be built at the NSA's
headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., located about halfway between
Washington and Baltimore.
   The NSA is the nation's biggest intelligence agency, with a work
force topping 60,000 employees _ more than all other U.S. spy
agencies combined _ and a budget said to be upwards of $10 billion a
year.
   Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the
globe, encrypting U.S. communications and cracking foreign codes, as
well as safeguarding the security of U.S. computers and
communications systems.
   James Bamford, an authority on the NSA, has reported that
computers cover more than 5{ acres at the agency's headquarters
complex.
   The NSA's basement, which stretches for city blocks,
``undoubtedly holds the largest and most advanced computer operation
in the world,'' Bamford wrote in his 1982 book, ``The Puzzle
Palace.''
   The Baltimore Sun quoted Mary Coady, a spokeswoman for National
Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., as saying that in
addition to building the computer chip plant ``we will also train
government personnel in the operation of the facility.''
   She declined to say when construction might start or how many
people were expected to work at the plant.
   The Sun also quoted George Heilmeier, senior vice president and
chief technical officer of Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc., as
saying that the new plant would be ``a unique facility with a unique
purpose.''
   By making its own chips at Fort Meade, he said, the government
gains more direct control, circumvents the bidding process on
essential microchips and increases plant security.

<HEAD>Thousands March Against Basque Separatist Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people marched
through this northern city in the Spanish Basque region Saturday,
demanding an end to Basque separatist violence, news reports said.
   Spanish National Radio said the crowd stretched out more than 1{
miles along the march route through the center of Bilbao.
   The independent SER network estimated the throng of marchers at
``nearly 300,000.'' Police declined to give crowd estimates.
   Representatives of the six major political parties representing
83 percent of the Basque electorate headed the demonstration,
carrying a banner reading ``Peace Now and Forever,'' calling on the
Basque separatist group ETA to lay down its arms.
   On Friday Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the autonomous Basque
regional government, called on the Basque separatist group to extend
indefinitely a cease-fire the separatists first declared Jan. 8 and
renewed 15 days later to extend through March 26, Easter Sunday.
   ETA, an acronym for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language,
has killed more than 600 people in its 20-year violent campaign to
secure independence for the three-province Spanish Basque country
known as Euskadi.
   ``We have come here today also to make clear our clear desire for
reconciliation,'' Ardanza said. ``We don't want a divided,
conflictive society. We don't want victors or vanquished.''
   There were no reports of incidents during the march that was
supported by organizations ranging from leftist trade unions to the
Red Cross.
   On Jan. 15, the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez resumed talks in Algeria with exiled ETA leader Eugenio
``Antxon'' Etxeveste in Algeria in an attempt to get ETA to give up
its weapons.
   It was not immediately clear what impact the march might have on
the cease-fire or the talks.
   Political observers interpreted wide support shown for the march
as a symbol of the growing public rejection of separatist terrorism
since the major Basque parties in the Basque regional parliament
signed a pact against terrorism on Jan. 19, 1988.

   Calling himself ``The Love Chef,'' Francis
Anthony set up shop on a restaurant balcony and proceeded to tell
and show people how to prepare romantic fare.
   Anthony, from New York City, was one of more than 60 author-chefs
who converged on Philadelphia this weekend to show off their special
dishes and the books they've written about them.
   ``You have to have a lot of love when you cook,'' Anthony told
his dining audience Thursday, stressing the added touches, such as
cloth napkins and flowers, which he said are just as important as
the food.
   It's all part of The Book and The Cook, an annual promotion
sponsored by the city and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors
Bureau. The city is alone in its approach, but backers say others
are planning their own versions.
   The promotion is a chance to spotlight the city's restaurant
scene, which has grown considerably in the past 10 years.
   The show began in 1985 with 22 author-cooks and restaurants
participating.
   A visiting chef collaborates with a restaurants to come up with a
dish not normally found on the menu.
   ``They were skeptical, both the authors and the restaurants,''
said Judy Faye of the city representatives office. Not to mention
the patrons.
   But the tradition was started and now, each March, diners can go
to their favorite restaurant for something out of the ordinary for
breakfast, lunch or dinner.
   It has been a success each year since the first one, Ms. Faye
said.
   ``We do have to turn down authors and also restaurants,'' she
said.
   The prices for the special meals range from $5 to over $100.
Literature listing locations and chefs rates the menus with dollar
signs. One $ means the cost will range from $5 to $15, two calls for
a range of $15 to $25, etc, on up to five dollar signs, which is
more than $100 per person.
   Anthony, who in addition to writing has appeared on television in
New York City and on radio around the country, appeared at Babe's
Steakhouse in northeast Philadelphia. His approach to cooking was
the element matched him to Babe's, which bills itself as the place
to ``Come back to romance.''
   Patrons found not only a book and a cook, but music as well. In
between adding ingredients, he sang ``Isn't it romantic?'' In the
background, the George Mesterhazy Trio played romantic music.
   Diner Carolyn Evans, who quickly wrote down recipes during the
show, said later she planned to cook the Veal Madeline and Banana
D'Amore that he demonstrated.
   ``It'll be a matter of experimenting,'' she said.
   Ms. Evans said she had been wanting to try the restaurant, which
opened six months ago, and The Book and The Cook gave her an added
incentive.
   Faye said she knows of no other city that has anything similar to
The Book and The Cook. ``We do have the mix,'' she said.
   The range is not only according to price, but in foods. Choices
include baked goods, wines, pastas, seafood and food prepared in a
microwave.
   Besides restaurants, other weekend locations include three of the
city's museums and a marina at Penn's Landing.

<TEXT>
   A year before Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg were executed for spying, Pablo Picasso did a lithograph
of the couple to raise money for their legal defense.
   Dozens of artists since then have been moved by the life and
death of the Rosenbergs, who in 1953 became the only Americans ever
executed for espionage after they refused to confess to helping the
Soviets get atomic bomb secrets and were convicted of conspiracy.
   A collection of 59 works by Picasso and other artists, from the
1950s to the 1980s, is touring the country in an exhibition titled,
``Unknown Secrets: Art and the Rosenberg Era.''
   ``There's still an ongoing controversy. There are still
questions,'' said Randy Ploog, assistant curator at Pennsylvania
State University's Palmer Museum of Art, where the show was
scheduled to open Sunday in the fourth of its nine stops.
   Rob A. Okun, who organized the exhibit, said that even though the
Rosenbergs were arrested nearly 40 years ago, a number of galleries
and museums balked at showing the controversial works. ``I did have
more difficulty placing the show than I thought,'' he said.
   In a telephone interview from his home in Montague, Mass., Okun
said he began looking for art relating to the Rosenbergs in 1985,
with a half-dozen names supplied by Robert Meeropol, one of the
Rosenbergs' two sons who is a friend of Okun's.
   ``The artwork of the Rosenberg era serves as a visual diary of
one of the most horrific political events of the 1950s,'' Okun wrote
in a book that accompanies the exhibit.
   ``I wanted to raise the issue that artists can effectively
address social and political issues in their art and have it be good
art,'' he said.
   Okun found art relating to the Rosenbergs from the United States,
Mexico, Sweden, Holland, Germany, Italy and France _ all of it
sympathetic to the couple. He also asked contemporary artists to do
new works about the couple.
   Picasso's lithograph is a simple, flattering dual portrait of the
Rosenbergs. But most of the other works in the exhibition are more
directly political, portraying the couple as scapegoats or martyrs,
or as an example of an unjust government.
   French artist Fernand Leger's 1952 silkscreen ``Liberty, Peace,
Solidarity,'' shows the Rosenbergs with a dove between them.
   In Alex Gray's 1987 work ``In Memory of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg,'' two goat skulls hang on a canvas shaped in the Star of
David. An American flag fills the canvas and covers the goat heads.
   In Karen Atkinson's 1987 ``Era After Era'' pictures of events
such as a Ku Klux Klan rally and an atomic bomb explosion are placed
on a map of the world where they occurred. A picture of the
Rosenbergs is placed above New York state.
   Okun said he could not find any art that was not sympathetic to
the couple.
   ``My personal opinion is that they were framed, that they were
the most severely treated victims of a dark time in our history,''
he said.
   Meeropol, who was 6 when his parents were executed and is now an
attorney in Springfield, Mass., said they continue to evoke strong
images because they never confessed.
   ``Their refusal is what made them powerful,'' he said.
   After the exhibit closes here, it will travel to the University
of Colorado Art Gallery in Boulder, opening June 8; Installation
Gallery in San Diego, Sept. 8; San Francisco Jewish Community
Museum, Jan. 7, 1990; Spertus Museum of Judaica in Chicago, May 21,
1990; and Aspen Art Museum, Sept. 20, 1990.

   Brazil Saturday unveiled Latin America's
largest cultural center, a complex of libraries, lecture halls and
galleries to bring together the region's artists, writers and
scientists.
   The eight futuristic, white concrete buildings _ known as the
Latin American Memorial _ were created by Brazilian architect Oscar
Niemeyer, who also designed the modernistic capital of Brasilia.
   Politicians and cultural figures from around Latin America
attended the inauguration, including Cuban Vice President Carlos
Rafael Rodriguez and former Chilean foreign minister Gabriel Valdez.
   In an interview with the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, Niemeyer
said the memorial was ``a call for the unity of the people of Latin
America so that together they can defend their rights and walk
together in the direction of social revolution.''
   The 100,000-square-yard memorial, which bears Niemeyer's
characteristic bold curves, archs and huge beams, cost the state of
Sao Paulo $37 million. It was built by Gov. Orestes Quercia.
   Anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro, the memorial's cultural affairs
adviser, said the complex will include the first library dedicated
exclusively to Latin America, with an initial collection of 30,000
books.

the act.
   Some released detainees have said they were tortured while
imprisoned, but Megat denies the charges.

<HEAD>Butterball Firm Tells Turkey Bowler To Take His Sport And Split</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former supermarket clerk trying to
rise to fame with a sport called ``Turkey Bowling'' that he says he
invented has ruffled some feathers at the company that sells
Butterball brand turkeys.
   Executives at Chicago-based Swift-Eckrich are mad because every
time Derrick Johnson of Santa Ana shows up on television to ``bowl''
a frozen turkey at 2-liter plastic soda bottles, his bird of choice
is a 12-pound Butterball.
   Johnson, who thought up the pastime one night while stocking
turkeys at a supermarket, has demonstrated turkey bowling on
national television, including the syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show''
and CBS's ``Sunday Morning.''
   But Swift-Eckrich told Johnson in a terse, four-paragraph letter
last month to stop using its turkeys because it ``damages the
Butterball quality image that we have spent millions of dollars to
develop.''
   The company threatened Johnson with a lawsuit and said it may
seek a court order to force him to quit using Butterballs and may
also seek damages.
   But Johnson, 29, a former Los Angeles Rams cheerleader and
Chippendales' nightclub dancer, refuses to abandon turkey bowling.
   ``No way!'' Johnson said Friday. ``This is my ticket into the big
time. If Swift-Eckrich wants me to stop, all they have to do is
write me a check. Better yet, why don't they hire me as their West
Coast spokesman. Apparently, I've done more to spread their name and
reputation than all their high-priced PR guys.''
   ``People ask why I don't use another turkey,'' Johnson said.
``Listen, I love Butterballs. That's all we had when I was growing
up. Let's just say I am a loyal customer.''
   He said he is too busy promoting his sport and himself to worry
about a lawsuit. He said he already has endorsements from a
sportswear and shoe company.
   He also is working with a local market to put on ``Grocery
Games,'' to raise money to buy food for the homeless.
   ``This is the sport of the '90s,'' Johnson said. ``I can see it
now. The party invitation will read: `BYOB _ Bring Your Own Bird.' ''

<TEXT>
   The White House family has six new members,
after a ``beautiful'' delivery by first dog Millie that brought a
tear to the eyes of President Bush and his wife, first lady Barbara
Bush said Saturday.
   The president, who joined his wife to watch one of the six
puppies delivered, described the experience Saturday as ``really
beautiful, it was unbelievable.''
   Asked if it was the first delivery he had witnessed, he replied,
``Yes, first dog delivery.'' Mrs. Bush, putting her arm around the
president's waist, indicated he had not seen any children born
either.
   The president made the comments when he was walking from the Oval
Office and happened upon a small group of reporters who were
chatting with his wife, accompanied by Millie, in a corridor of the
White House.
   ``The president and I cried when we saw one of them being born
... We had a tear. It was really sweet,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``It was
so beautiful to see her.''
   All of the puppies were described as ``nursing vigorously'' from
Millie, and the first dog appeared in good spirits, padding around
at her masters' feet.
   ``They're wonderful. They're really cute,'' Mrs. Bush said,
adding that it had been an easy delivery. While Mrs. Bush played
midwife, Millie ``did all the work,'' she said. ``She was wonderful.
She knew exactly what to do.''
   Bush said the first couple would not keep a puppy, but that one
had already been promised to grandchild Marshall Bush, 2, who was at
the White House with her parents Marvin and Margaret Bush on
Saturday.
   When prompted, Marshall imitated the squeaking noise made by the
puppies.
   Another pup was promised to the twin daughters of Bush's son
George who lives in Texas.
   ``They're really lovely looking puppies,'' Mrs. Bush said.
``They're all really beautiful.''
   The litter included a ``big white girl'' and a female runt that
has a little triangle on her back.
   The Bushes' English springer spaniel gave birth to her six-puppy
litter over a five-hour period Friday night and early Saturday
morning.
   Mrs. Bush helped Millie deliver the puppies, while President
Bush, who had jokingly complained on Friday about being forced out
of his bedroom to make room for Millie, lent ``moral support,'' said
Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez. However, Bush wound up not
having to sleep down the hall because all the puppies were delivered
by early Saturday morning.
   Mrs. Bush walked Millie several times Saturday, and spent time
with the puppies during the day. Bush who spent the day meeting
Cabinet members and advisers, and playing tennis, also visited their
nursery, the former White House beauty salon which was remade for
the new family.
   Mrs. Bush, who the president said had been increasingly nervous
about the coming birth, ``feels more comfortable now,'' said Ms.
Perez.
   ``Millie is apparently a very good mother,'' Ms. Perez added.
``The puppies started nursing immediately. Mom and babies and
midwife are doing fine.''
   The puppies will live in the White House residential quarters for
up to six weeks, and are all promised to new owners after that.
   The word of impending delivery came about 9 p.m. Friday as the
Bushes entertained a group of guests for a movie, ``New York
Stories,'' in the White House theater following dinner.
   Mrs. Bush slipped out and, ``At the end of the movie, the
president announced we had two puppies and more on the way,'' Ms.
Perez said.
   Bush himself ``was in on one birth, lending moral support,'' and
he brought a folding mattress to the delivery room for Mrs. Bush,
she said.
   The puppies were born in a wooden whelping box decorated with the
presidential seal.
   Millie's mate was Tug III, a springer spaniel owned by Bush's
friend, William Farish, who also gave them Millie. Tug III lives at
Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Ky.
   On Friday Bush disclosed that the first lady had informed him he
would be sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom, alone, to make way for
Millie who would rather sleep in the master bedroom than the beauty
salon, which had been converted into a nursery for her.
   Mrs. Bush told him that Millie ``had a very bad night last night,
thrashing around.''

   Claude Montana gave the starring role to enormous
soft collars and corolla shapes in his winter ready-to-wear show
Saturday that was an exercise in restrained beauty.
   This influential designer switches gears regularly, moving from
football shoulders to pyramid shapes but switching to soft lines in
winter collections.
   The clothes were not very feminine. But in just a few perfect
shades and fabrics, they were so well constructed that the fashion
world took notice.
   For the early 1990s, futuristic Montana kicked off with a line of
every imaginable subtle shade of blue, pairing slim ``petrol'' blue
cuffed pants with glacier or deep blue belted peignoir tulip-wrapped
coats.
   The collars were outsized and oval or flounced in waves down the
front. Sleeves were often flared like bluebells.
   The most amazing toppers here _ also in everything from sky or
ice blue to aqua or spotted like ocelot _ were in dyed sheared mink.
It looked like iridescent plush, and appeared in handsome hooded
boleros, ponchos or puffy shrugs.
   Besides the important collar styles, Montana also went in for a
tiny-busted silhouette with a swelling around the hips, which he
dubbed a ``peanut'' shape, a sort of weird variation on the
redingote coat or jacket.
   Skirts didn't appear often, but when they did they were long and
straight, worn with tights in matching shades.
   Browns from mahogany to peanut and charcoal or black with
suggestions of other shades like green or rust completed the
low-keyed color palette.
   Japanese designer Issey Miyake as usual was interested in
sculpting or shaping his fabrics in outfits that ended up looking
more like art than clothes.
   His ``zig-zag'' line of brown or blue knits turned out with
pleated and pointed effects.
   He gave stiffened square outlines and collars to some of his long
raincoats, and the hats were folded into points to look like paper
gliders.
   This time his synthetic silk, Chinese lantern-pleated fabric was
molded so that the models moved along jerkily like automatons.
   Guy Paulin turned to the past for his inspiration, but it was
nothing baroque or fancy, choosing rather the sleek vein of Greta
Garbo. He began with a nice line of clothes inspired by Garbo's film
``Queen Christina.''
   In heather and misty blue plaids, knickers and long pants were
topped by loose and long vests or short coats with natural
shoulders. Full and long tweed skirts under full double-caped short
coats had a nice easy trapeze style.
   The low-key but wearable day clothes also featured good
cable-knit twin sets with sandy tweed pants, off-white jackets with
paisley linings, soft jersey pants suits in teal, taupe and rust.
   Things were a lot more feminine at Balenciaga, as the designer
Michel Goma featured a lot of dressy evening wear.
   He offset the autumnal shades and androgynous tendencies seen in
the rest of the day's shows with a screaming-hot line of red taffeta
lace and chiffon.

<HEAD>Protesters Say Hunters Slaughtering Even More Seals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hundred animal lovers demonstrated Saturday
against the slaughter of baby seals off Newfoundland's north coast,
saying it is worse now than when it was made illegal in 1982.
   Hunters have shifted their sights to pups older than nine days
since the 1982 legislation prohibited killing of ``white coats'' _
seals under that age, said a spokesman for demonstrators from
Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto, who marched peacefully around
Parliament building.
   ``That makes it even worse,'' said Stephen Best of Toronto, vice
president of the International Wildlife Coalition that organized the
protest.
   ``Where the `white coats' were taken on the pan ice around the
north shore of Newfoundland and just about all that were killed were
harvested, the hunt now is mainly at sea where it's estimated three
pups have to be killed for every one got into the boats.
   ``Now it's on the open seas where it is almost impossible to
regulate. There aren't any inspectors or scientists out there.
Nobody knows what's going on,'' he said.
   The harvest, which bottomed out at 20,000 seals a year right
after the legislation was enacted, since has risen to 80,000, Best
said.
   He also said the government issues 9,000 licenses a season to
hunt seals, compared to 5,000 before the legislation. The government
quota for this season is 186,000 harp seals and 2,340 hooded seals,
he said.
   ``We thought we had won in 1982, and so did everyone else,'' Best
recalls. ``But we didn't win; we lost. Now we've got to start all
over again.''

   President Bush met with key Cabinet members
Saturday to consider whether to enter a joint agreement with Japan
to produce a new generation of fighter plane, and a decision is
expected early in the week, his press secretary said.
   Among those summoned to the White House for an unusual Saturday
working session were Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Chief
of Staff John Sununu, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and
newly confirmed Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.
   Bush is considering a proposed joint venture with the Japanese
for production in Japan of a new version of the F-16 jet fighter,
called the FSX.
   Bush on Saturday laughed and waved off a question on whether he
had made a decision about the project when he happened upon a small
group of reporters who were chatting with first lady Barbara Bush at
the White House.
   In remarks to reporters on Friday he sought to play down earlier
suggestions that a basic commitment had been made to the project,
with only details remaining to be worked out.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called his team to the
White House Saturday because ``he wanted to review some of the
technical issues.''
   He said Bush's decision probably would come ``early next week.''
   Bush has been studying data on the controversial proposal, which
critics say would give the Japanese advanced U.S. technical data, a
move that would undercut the U.S. industrial and trade base.
   Bush's advisers are known to be divided on the merits of the
deal. Mosbacher has taken the lead in raising concerns over
commercial and technological implications of the agreement, which
was negotiated by the Pentagon and State Department.
   Under the U.S.-Japan deal initialed late last year, St.
Louis-based General Dynamics would join forces with Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and co-produce the
next-generation fighter.
   Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the
United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to
buying F-16s directly from the United States. They say the deal
would serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both
directions while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.
   But critics contend the tentative arrangement amounts to a
giveaway of advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel
its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with
the United States in the world market. They say Tokyo should
purchase American-made planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   While the president worked and played tennis and horseshoes on a
balmy afternoon, first lady Barbara Bush was preoccupied with her
dog Millie's new litter, born Friday night and early Saturday.
   By the time Mrs. Bush was ready to play tennis with Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor at mid-afternoon, the sky had clouded
and a blustery rain was falling.
   But Mrs. Bush said the family had lunch at poolside earlier.
   Bush had said Friday that he was eager to ``unleash all the
athletic events'' for the weekend at the White House.
   His new horseshoe pit was to be formally opened in a couple of
weeks with what Bush called a ``very big gala opening'' featuring
horseshoe pitchers from across the country.
   Bush said he was also expecting to pick up his outdoor running
again. He has been using an indoor treadmill. He said he had a
``hiatus'' from his usual two-mile jog in recent weeks because he
had the flu.

   Rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation
Army on Saturday claimed they had taken the southern provincial
capital of Mongalla.
   The government did not confirm the reports, but Prime Minister
Sadek Mahdi on Saturday met with senior military and security
officials to review the situation in the province, Equatoria.
   The rebels, in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Liberation,
said they took Mongalla from government troops on Friday. The
broadcast, monitored in Khartoum, did not give details of the
reported capture.
   The southern rebels, mostly Christians and animists, oppose the
government, which is deominated by the north's Moslem Arab majority.
They initiated the country's civil war in 1983 to push for greater
autonomy.
   Mahdi has been under pressure from the military and opposition
parties to include the rebels in a broad-based government coalition
and end the civil war. Mongalla was the capital of southern Sudan
under British rule, which ended in 1956.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a U.N. office in
Afghanistan said Saturday that the pact that ended the Soviet
military involvement in the nation has been breached, but he would
not say who committed them or what they were.
   The comments came on the same day as at least four Soviet IL-76
military transports arrived in Kabul. The Soviets, which completed
its troop withdrawal last month, resumed military aid to the
government last week.
   The U.N. official, Maj. Gen. Rauli Helminen, said Pakistan and
Afghanistan have repeatedly charged each other with violating the
accord, but their complaints have often proved inaccurate. Others
are difficult to check, he told a news conference.
   Helminen heads the U.N. Good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and
Pakistan. It was set up to investigate alleged violations of the
Geneva Accord that cleared the way for the Red Army's departure
after nine years in Afghanistan.
   The mission is made up of about 40 officers from Austria, Canada,
Denmark, Fiji, Finland, Ghana, Iceland, Nepal, Poland and Sweden.
   ``There are problems. After 11 months, more than half of our
mandate remains unfulfilled,'' said Helminen, who is from Finland.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed under the accord to stay out of
each other's internal affairs. But since then, he said, the Kabul
government has filed 3,000 complaints accusing Pakistan of violating
the accord by continuing to arm the Moslem insurgents and sending
hundreds of its soldiers into Afghanistan.
   Pakistan, which supports the Moslem guerrillas trying to
overthrow Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government, has lodged at
least 800 complaints against Afghanistan. Pakistan says Afghan
planes have bombed its territory in attacks on Moslem guerrilla
camps.
   The Kabul government has called on the United Nations to set up
checkpoints along the border. But Helminen said that will not happen
until warring Afghans call a cease-fire.
   The Soviets have said they will continue to supply equipment to
President Najib's troops as long as Pakistan and the United States
supply the guerrillas.
   The military supplies Moscow is supplying to Kabul include
medium-range Scud B missiles and other defensive arms.
   The Soviets resumed the military supplies after guerrillas
launched an offensive against Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan.
After nearly two weeks, heavy fighting around the strategic city
appears to have reached a stalemate.

   Thousands
of Moslems paraded through Salman Rushdie's hometown Saturday
demanding a judicial inquiry into the police killings of 13 people
during a protest against Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In France, authorities in Lyon banned a demonstration planned
Saturday afternoon to protest the novel, saying the march threatened
public order.
   Iran's state-run media on Saturday said Moslem leaders'
condemnation of Rushdie last week was a victory for Iran, even
though the leaders stopped short of supporting Iran's call for
Rushdie's death as punishment for the book, which many Moslems find
blasphemous.
   Also Saturday, Britain's ambassador to Lebanon said the
controversy over ``The Satanic Verses'' may not have hurt prospects
for the release of 15 foreign hostages there.
   In the 10-mile-long Bombay march, young Moslems waving black
banners and shouting ``down with Bombay police'' tried to surge
ahead, but older men held them back while steel-helmeted policemen
stood along the road, watching silently.
   All shops had closed along the procession's route and traffic had
thinned. Thousands of armed policemen in riot gear followed the
procession.
   During a demonstration Feb. 24, police opened fire to stop
defiant Moslems from marching to the British consulate, killing 13
people. The crowd was demanding a ban in Britain on Rushdie's book.
   Nineteen people in India and Pakistan have died in violence
related to the novel.
   Bombay-born Rushdie is a British citizen who maintains that his
book is neither against Islam nor its holy book, the Koran. Iranian
clerics last month offered a $5.2 million reward for Rushdie's
murder and he has been in hiding since.
   ``The Satanic Verses,'' banned in India and several other
nations, includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of
Mohammed's wives and the suggestion that the prophet wrote the Koran
rather than receiving it fromn Allah.
   Iran's official Tehran radio said Saturday hailed the ``decisive
stance'' taken by leaders at the meeting of the 45-nation
Organization of Islamic Conference. At the meeting, which ended
Thursday in Saudi Arabia, the members voted to declare Rushdie an
apostate.
   The conference did not confirm Khomeini's death sentence as Iran
hoped, but Iranian news commentaries played down that fact and said
declaring Rushdie an apostate was tantamount to confirming
Khomeini's death sentence.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said
that the conference decision made headlines in all the Iranian
papers, each callin the organization's declaration a victory for
Iran and Islam.
   Iran severed ties with Britain earlier this month over what it
saw as London's role for protecting Rushdie and leading the European
reaction against Iran.
   The 12 members of the European Economic Community recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran to protest Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's execution order against Rushdie.
   The British ambassador in Beirut, Allan Ramsay, said in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that although many
felt the Rushdie affair set back prospects for release of the
foreign hostages, ``I am not sure that is correct.
   ``I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by some
leading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms
that there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is very
much a crime against Islam,'' Ramsay said.
   But he warned: ``I do not want to raise release hopes and I do
not want to sound over-optimistic.''
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists. American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
is the longest-held. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Farmers were urged to save their faltering
nation Saturday as they gathered for the first congress in eight
years of their banned union, Rural Solidarity.
   ``The national economy is destroyed. People in towns and villages
live on the edge of poverty. But this is our country. We have to
save it for ourselves and our children,'' union chairman Jozef Slisz
told 450 farmers from every region of the country.
   Slisz said the congress must ensure authorities keep a promise to
legalize Rural Solidarity and that the union must prepare for
national elections of the union in December.
   The meeting took place before the end of talks between
authorities and the opposition which have yielded agreement in
principle to legalize Solidarity, Rural Solidarity and the
Independent Students' Association.
   All three were banned after martial law was introduced December
1981. Parliament will consider draft legislation Tuesday to legalize
them again.
   ``During those eight years, which we spent in prison or in
hiding, we did not forget the ideals of Solidarity. Some of our
colleagues paid with their lives,'' Slisz reminded members and some
50 invited foreigners and advisers.
   ``We can meet again after eight years thanks to Mr. Walesa,
thanks to his persistence and determination. He is the symbol of
Solidarity for cities and villages,'' he said of Lech Walesa, leader
of the allied workers' union, Solidarity.
   The hall erupted into chants of ``Solidarnosc! Solidarnosc!''
when Walesa appeared.
   ``My role has been to lead you to this point, so that you can
meet and decide about your own activities,'' he told cheering
farmers.
   Later Saturday, Solidarity's national executive commission met to
assess the state of talks with authorities.
   ``I am satisfied. The meeting was full of arguments, but it
helped clarify things,'' Walesa told reporters afterward.
   The meeting came as the talks near their final phase, and a day
after the union declared a crisis over the authorities' decision to
submit an electoral reform bill to Parliament without consulting the
opposition.
   Solidarity has said the bill did not reflect agreements reached
for what would be the communist bloc's first democratic elections.
   The government late Friday said it only wanted Parliament to
discuss the bill, not prejudge any agreement.
   Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the powerful Solidarity leader from Silesia,
said Saturday he did not think the conflict would derail final
agreement on political and economic reforms.
   ``I cannot see such a possibility in which this accord would not
take place,'' he said.

   Disclosures of detailed warnings in Europe
before the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland have prompted
calls for new investigations and appeals for more government
openness about terrorist threats.
   A congressional subcommittee analysis of Federal Aviation
Administration security warnings, due for release Sunday, will show
that many FAA warnings are ``woefully inadequate,'' according to a
committee staff member.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner dispatched top aides to
Europe this weekend to examine the growing controversy over the
warnings and to determine the safety of U.S. airlines from terrorist
attack.
   And, some of the relatives of the 270 people killed in the Dec.
21 disaster planned a White House protest April 3, the 103rd day
after the bombing.
   Bert Ammerman, the brother of one of those killed, pleaded: ``I'd
like the opportunity to make my own decison on whether I die on a
plane or not.''
   The latest actions follow revelations and discussions in London
and Washington about very specific warnings that airlines and
government officials were sharing in Europe and the United States in
the weeks before the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   None of the information got to passengers.
   Pan Am, after it did warn passengers of a bomb threat against a
New York-Paris flight last week, said it has a long-standing policy
of advising travelers and giving them the option of taking other
flights when there is a specific threat against an individual flight.
   The Lockerbie disaster was not preceded by any reported threat
that named a specific plane.
   But disclosures over the past several weeks indicate that
authorities had several other warnings, including what airline and
flights might be endangered, in what month the bombing could occur,
what type of explosive and triggering device might be used and even
how the bomb might be concealed in a radio-cassette.
   Investigators concluded that a radio-cassette containing plastic
explosives set to go off at a certain altitude blew up Pan Am Flight
103.
   Both British aviation authorities and the Federal Aviation
Administration had described a radio-cassette bomb in security
warnings a month earlier, after one was confiscated in a raid in
West Germany on the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command.
   Pan Am acknowledges that it received a warning about such a
device from the West German government on Nov. 10.
   Various other warnings that have elements similar to what
occurred in the Pan Am bombing also were issued Dec. 5 to all
airlines, Dec. 13 to U.S. embassies, Nov. 17 to U.S. airlines, Nov.
22 to British airlines and Dec. 19 to British airports and several
airlines. Some of the warnings, including the final one two days
before the bombing, were not received for several days.
   Although investigators apparently have focused much of their
attention on the Palestinian guerrilla group which was the subject
of some of the warnings, British officials said Friday that contrary
to London press reports, they had not captured or identified any
suspected bomber.
   On Capitol Hill, where several committees have been examining
issues raised by the destruction of Flight 103, House Government
Operations subcommittee staff members were compiling 27 FAA security
warnings issued in 1988 and another four this year, most of them not
made public.
   The subcommittee planned to look into how each one was handled,
who was warned, when they were warned, and how the government and
airlines dealt with the threats, a subcommitee source said,
discussing the report on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are looking at their accuracy, timeliness and usefulness,''
the source said.
   The report is to focus particularly on the Nov. 17 warning
dealing with a radio-cassette bomb. The source said subcommittee
chairwoman Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., decided to conduct the
analysis because there of confusion about the warnings and a host of
complaints from victims' relatives and others.
   Ammerman, a New Jersey high school administrator who was one of
about 20 victims' relatives who met with Skinner, said the families
are calling for a ban on all batteries on airliners, because plastic
explosives cannot be set off without a battery.
   The group also wants a system set up so passengers can call a
number and find out about any threats, more efforts to match luggage
with passengers and routine questioning of passengers as they board
flights.
   ``At best, this has been handled in a chaotic way,'' said
Ammerman, whose brother Tom was killed in the bombing. ``At worst,
there's been a coverup.''

   Maryland has a state fish, a state bird, a
state dog, a state butterfly. It even has a state fossil shell.
   But what is arguably Maryland's most popular member of the animal
kingdom _ at least among diners _ is nowhere to be found in the list
of official state symbols.
   The House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee voted
Saturday to correct that oversight, approving a bill by Democratic
Delegate Dana Dembrow designating the Maryland blue crab as the
official state crustacean.
   Now, only the approval of the House, the Senate and Gov. William
Donald Schaefer are needed to allow the crab to take its rightful
place alongside the rockfish, the Baltimore Oriole, the Chesapeake
Bay retriever, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly and the ecphora
quadricostata on the list of state symbols.
   Incidentally, the ecphora quadricostata inhabitated the
Chesapeake Bay and other East Coast tidal waters 5 million or more
years ago and lives on as the state fossil.

   A 36-step pencil sharpener devised by
the home team won the Rube Goldberg Machine Contest on Saturday by
making a simple task hard.
   Goldberg, who died in 1970, was a cartoonist famous for his
humorously complicated machines to perform simple tasks. In keeping
with his spirit, student teams from three universities invented
machines designed to sharpen a wooden pencil in less than five
minutes, with at least 25 steps.
   Purdue University engineering students won with a contraption
called ``Watch-N-Ponder,'' in part because, unlike the entries from
the University of Detroit and the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, no one had to nudge and prod their machine to the finish
line.
   The Watch-N-Ponder was set in motion by placing a test paper in
the hand of a doll dressed like a student, which activated a panic
sign. Thirty-some-odd steps later, a newly sharpened pencil fell
through a series of guides into the arms of the doll, who then
exclaimed with a cartoon-style caption, ``Whew, Thanks!''
   A $100 second-place prize went to the University of Wisconsin
team for ``Bucky Badger's Hydro-Electro-Mechanical All-Purpose
Pencil Sharpener.'' The badger is the Wisconsin school symbol.
   The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest originated at Purdue in 1949 as
a competition between two engineering fraternities. It died out in
the mid-'50s but was revived six years ago and opened to all Purdue
students.
   This year was the first ``national'' competition, which drew the
entries from Detroit and Wisconsin. Some other schools held local
contests but didn't send teams here, organizers said.

   A U.S. Postal Service official invoked
Pogo's most famous words at the introduction of a postcard honoring
the cartoon character's home, the Okefenokee Swamp.
   ``We have met the enemy, and he is us,'' said Regional Postmaster
General William A. Campbell Jr. on Friday, using the fictional
possum's comic comment to describe the environmental threat to the
swamp and other wetlands.
   At the ceremony at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge,
Campbell was joined by Selby Kelly, widow of cartoonist Walt Kelly,
who picked the Okefenokee Swamp at random from a library book in the
1940s when Pogo was created. Kelly died in 1973.
   The 15-cent postcard depicts a scene from deep inside the
450,000-acre Okefenokee refuge, with a great blue heron poised for
flight in the foreground.
   It will go on sale nationwide Monday, but a special first-day
Okefenokee, Ga., postmark was available Friday to guests at the
dedication and at the main post office in downtown Waycross.

<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Develop In The East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms broke out Saturday in the East, ice coated highways
and powerlines in Michigan, and up to a foot of snow fell in the
mountains of northern California.
   Temperatures rose to record highs along the East Coast,
including: 82 in Baltimore; 70 in Hartford, Conn.; 78 in Newark,
N.J.; 77 in New York City; 78 in Philadelphia; and 77 in Wilmington,
Del.
   The collision of that moist, warm air with cold air from the
north set the stage for thunderstorms that developed along a cold
front extending from southern New England through much of the
Appalachian region and the Tennessee Valley.
   A thunderstorm in eastern Pennsylvania produced strong wind that
downed trees at Pottsville, and a thunderstorm in eastern West
Virginia produced wind gusts to 58 mph at Martinsburg, the National
Weather Service said.
   Behind the cold front, heavy snow blanketed parts of the
Northeast overnight, with snowfall totals by Saturday in Vermont
ranging up to 8 inches at Derby and 7 inches at Canaan.
   Freezing temperatures followed rain or snow across Michigan's
Lower Peninsula, glazing roads and downing power lines that cut
electrical service to up to 109,000 households, officials said.
Between 8 and 12 inches of snow fell Friday and early Saturday
across parts of the area.
   ``It's been awful, awful,'' said Michigan State Police Sgt. Chris
Ignaczak in Detroit, where at least 100 traffic accidents, one a
20-car chain collision, were reported between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m.
Saturday. No serious injuries were reported.
   In the West, a cold front spread rain over northern California
and the northern Pacific Coast region and snow fell at higher
elevations of northern California and western Nevada.
   Up to 10 inches of snow blanketed the Lake Tahoe area of Nevada
overnight, with 12 inches reported at Chester, Calif. Up to two feet
of snow was expected in the Lake Tahoe area by Sunday morning, along
with up to 3 feet of snow in the neighboring Sierra Nevada range.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees above zero at Warroad, Minn., to 89 at McAllen, Texas.
Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 below zero at Warroad.
   For Sunday, scattered showers were forecast from the northern and
central Pacific Coast across Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, with snow
over northwestern Wyoming and western and central Montana. Widely
scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast across Louisiana
and southern and central Texas. Widely scattered rain and snow
showers were forecast over the upper Great Lakes region and the
upper Mississippi Valley.
   Highs in the 20s and low 30s were predicted from Montana through
Minnesota to northern New England; in the 40s from the central
rockies through Minnesota and Iowa to the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast; above 70 from southern California through southern
and central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia; in the 80s across
the Florida Peninsula, in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and
in the desert Southwest.

   A Teamsters official threatened on Saturday to
expand the Eastern Airlines strike to rival Pan American, while
union leaders discussed ways for employees to buy both carriers in
``the opportunity of a lifetime.''
   Eastern employees rallied in Washington, New Jersey and New York,
where Gov. Mario Cuomo threw his support behind the workers and
challenged President Bush to intervene in the labor war with Eastern
boss Frank Lorenzo.
   Eastern's 8,500 Machinists entered their third week on strike,
which has crippled the nation's seventh-largest airline and forced
it to seek bankruptcy protection. The workers have refused to give
wage concessions.
   And a top Teamsters official warned that the strike could be
expanded to struggling Pan Am, which competes with Eastern on the
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle route.
   ``One of the (strike) targets would be the shuttle of Pan
American ... where Eastern Airlines is now being picketed,'' said
William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters Air Division.
``Therefore we could tie up the Northeast corridor of the United
States.
   ``The strike at Eastern Airlines is a fight for every working
person in the United States.''
   Federal judges have restrained other unions from sympathy strikes
that could have extended to the nation's railways and other
airlines. But Genoese said a Pan Am strike would be legal because
its 4,200 Teamsters employees have an open contract and other unions
could honor their picket lines as pilots and flight attendants have
done at Eastern.
   Pan American has beefed up its shuttle service since Eastern's
strike began March 4 while Eastern dropped fares to attract
passengers to its shuttle flights.
   Genoese said he didn't want to discuss strike timing or strategy
further.
   Meanwhile, rallies in Washington, New York and Newark launched
the third week of the walkout.
   A crowd estimated by police at more than 1,000 turned out for a
rousing, flag-waving rally at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Gov.
Mario Cuomo, wearing a black satin pilot's jacket and a pilot's cap,
challenged President Bush to intervene in the labor war with Lorenzo.
   ``Focus your thousand points of light on this situation. It's
time to lead, Mr. President,'' he said.
   In Washington, about 300 people gathered across the street from
the White House to hear similar remarks aimed at Bush, who was
reported to be relaxing on the White House grounds playing
horseshoes and tennis.
   ``C'mon George, get with it,'' said Interntional Association of
Machinists President William Winpisinger, pointing at the White
House. He called for Bush to intervene by naming an emergency board
to mediate the dispute.
   Bush declined to impose a cooling-off period that would have
delayed the strike by 60 days, and has remained opposed to
government intervention in the walkout that began March 3.
   Jesse Jackson, who has been walking picket lines with the
strikers in the past two weeks, said he was making ``an appeal to
presidential leadership, an appeal for mercy and justice.''
   In Newark, a crowd estimated at about 700 people attended a rally
in front of the Continental Airlines terminal that was cut short by
torrential rains.
   Genoese made his comments after having breakfast Saturday with
Charles E. Bryan, head of Eastern's Machinists union, and local
Teamsters and Machinists officials to discuss strategy, including a
proposed joint employee buyout that would combine the two struggling
airlines.
   ``This is the opportunity of a lifetime,'' Genoese said. ``They
can save two airlines.''
   Bryan has been pushing several years for employee control of
Eastern as a solution to its problems, and Genoese said Eastern's
situation provides an opening to combine that goal with a similar
effort he has pushed for years at Pan Am.
   Bryan said the employees had ample financial backing, but
declined to give details.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company wouldn't comment
on the Bryan-Genoese remarks. There was no answer Saturday at Pan Am
corporate headquarters.
   Although Eastern and Pan Am are two of the weakest major
carriers, Bryan and Genoese said their route structures and
personnel combined could create a strong, stable airline.
   Bryan added that other possibilities are still being explored,
such as a buyout of Lorenzo by financier Carl Icahn, owner and
chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc. Lorenzo has expressed renewed
interest in selling Eastern.
   Pan Am, like Eastern, has been racked by financial losses and
labor tensions. Pan Am Chairman Tom Plaskett recently said the
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure
its survival.
   In a memo circulated Friday, Eastern said it could no longer wait
for its pilots to return to work.
   ``New pilots are our only viable option,'' the message said. ``In
summary, total pilot capacity will determine whether Eastern lives
or dies.''
   However, the pilots union says few experienced pilots are
available for Eastern to hire.
   Eastern, with only 200 pilots crossing picket lines, has been
able to operate about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1,040
daily flights.
   Bryan said the Eastern unions will fight in bankruptcy court
against all sales and transfers of Eastern assets, including the
airline's notice late last week that it was putting narrow-body
planes in its 250-aircraft fleet up for sale.
   He said transfers of assets such as Eastern landing slots in New
York and Washington to Texas Air's predominantly non-union
Continental are part of ``an enormous psychological war'' against
Eastern employees.

   Israeli troops opened fire on hundreds of
Palestinian protesters in Gaza City on Saturday, killing three
Arabs. At least 20 people were reported wounded in clashes in the
Gaza Strip.
   Also Saturday, a breakaway faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization said two of its fighters sneaked into Israel from
Jordan and started a gunfight Friday that left one Israeli soldier
dead and another wounded. Jordan said it arrested the infiltrators.
   Arab reports said Gaza protests began after Israeli riot police
plastered posters on walls in a neighborhood calling on residents to
keep the peace.
   ``What's the benefit of a demolished house, a killed son?'' an
Arab reporter quoted the placards as saying. The army said it knew
nothing about the posters.
   Enraged Arabs gathered at a nearby mosque, calling for a ``fight
against the army,'' the reporter said on condition of anonymity.
   Protesters took to the streets, pelting soldiers with rocks,
blocking roads and burning tires, he said. Demonstrations quickly
spread to other Gaza City areas and refugee camps, said Arab
accounts.
   Merchants shut down stores and transportation came to a halt, and
one witness said ``there are burning tires and barricades
everywhere.''
   An army spokeswoman said hundreds of Palestinian rioters in the
Gaza neighborhood attacked a patrol with stones, concrete blocks and
metal bars.
   ``The soldiers felt that their lives were in danger and fired
tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets,'' she said on condition of
anonymity.
   The attack continued until reinforcements arrived, helping the
soldiers escape, she said.
   ``As a result, three people were killed and 10 others wounded,''
the spokeswoman said.
   The army later clamped a curfew on the neighborhood, but
residents defied it to hold a funeral procession, Arab reports said.
The procession was dispersed with tear gas, the reports said.
   Arab doctors identified the victims as Fawsi Mohammed Bahid, 20,
and Abdel Nasser Sherif, 19, who were both shot in the chest, and
Majdi Kourani, 19, who was shot in the neck.
   An Arab witness said Sherif hurled stones at soldiers 150 feet
away, refusing to stop when friends begged him. He said a soldier
threatened Sherif by pointing his gun, ``but he continued to throw
stones.''
   ``Then one soldier fired,'' the witness said.
   At least another 10 Arabs were wounded elsewhere on the seaside
Gaza Strip, said doctors at two Gaza City hospitals.
   Protests continued into the night.
   Saturday's deaths bring to 399 the number of Arabs killed since
in the 15-month uprising against Israeli rule in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank _ areas Israel captured in 1967 from Egypt and Jordan.
Seventeen Israelis also have died.
   The official Jordan news agency Petra said authorities arrested
the two infiltrators Saturday inside Jordan.
   In Damascus, Syria, Fatah-Uprising claimed the two men were
members of its breakaway Palestinian group. The group, which earlier
said the two men returned safely, later confirmed its fighters were
caught and warned Jordan not to harm them.
   The two guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in southern Hatzeva
area, 70 miles south of Jerusalem.
   Israel radio said just before the 10 p.m. clash, soldiers heard a
man shout ``Stop!'' from behind a bush in English. The guerrillas
fired assault rifles, then fled.
   It was the fourth Palestinian guerrilla raid against Israel in a
week. Two other raids were in southern Lebanon and the third across
the border with Egypt. Five guerrillas were killed in Lebanon, and
two who infiltrated from Egypt were captured.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat, visiting Budapest Friday, denied that
Palestinian attacks against the Israeli army in south Lebanon were
acts of terrorism.
   ``Those who are defending themselves cannot be named
terrorists,'' Arafat said, referring to Israeli attacks against
Palestinian strongholds in Lebanon.
   In December Arafat said he renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist. His remarks led Washington to open a
dialogue with the PLO.
   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as a terrorist
group.
   In northern Israel Saturday, about 100 Israeli high school
students threw stones and firebombs at police as they participated
in a mock battle to prepare riot police for Arab demonstrations
later this month.
   Israeli officials are worried that a planned strike by Israeli
Arabs on so-called Land Day March 30 will turn into a violent show
of support for the Palestinian rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Each year, Israeli Arabs mark Land Day to commemorate the bloody
day of March 30, 1976, when Israeli troops and police killed six
Arabs during a strike protesting government confiscation of Arab
land in the Galilee.

   The military and police intensified
the search Saturday for a gunman who killed a Filipino congressman
moments after the lawmaker arrived in the island province of
Masbate, police said.
   Special investigating teams from Manila and regional headquarters
were sent to the area and checkpoints were placed across the island
235 miles south of Manila, said Col. Marino Filart, regional
Philippine Constabulary commander.
   Rep. Moises Espinosa was the first member of Congress to be slain
since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986.
   Police said Espinosa, 55, was walking across the airport tarmac
to his car Friday when the gunman dressed in fatigues and sunglasses
opened fire with an AK-47 rifle and fled on a motorcycle with a
companion.
   Amado Gaspar, an Espinosa aide who was wounded in the ambush,
died early Saturday, police said. A provincial guard and an airport
employee also were killed and a student was wounded.
   Espinosa ran as an independent but later joined the Struggle of
the Democratic Filipino, which supports Mrs. Aquino. He was a member
of former President Ferdinand Marcos' New Society Movement party
until Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising three years ago.

   Flags waved, tears of pride
flowed and a spontaneous rendition of the national anthem broke out
in the desert dawn Saturday among the 450,000 people who watched the
return of the space shuttle Discovery.
   ``I'm just fascinated by it,'' said Bob Dube, 34, of Canyon
Country, Calif., a veteran of the temporary encampments that spring
up on Rogers Dry Lake here for landings of the winged spacecraft.
   The crowd, many of whom arrived earlier in the week, burst out in
whistles and cheers at the thump of two sonic booms that preceded
Discovery's arrival over this Mojave Desert base 60 miles north of
Los Angeles.
   About two minutes later the ship appeared, seemingly straight
overhead, as a speck glinting in the dawn sunlight. Most lapsed into
surprised silence at the shuttle's steep descent, but the
celebration resumed as Discovery landed on a strip about five miles
distant at 6:35 a.m. PST.
   Spectators clapped, whooped, snapped pictures and waved American
flags. Many spontaneously began singing the national anthem. Some
cried; others hugged their children.
   ``The patriotic spirit here is really something,'' said Ernie
Weiss, 70, of Garden Grove, who flew a flag atop a telescoping
60-foot pole. ``I even bought a new flag for this.''
   NASA officials estimated the crowd at the public viewing area at
450,000, and said an additional 10,000 watched at the NASA facility.
That was second only to the 500,000 who joined President Reagan to
watch shuttle Columbia's July 4, 1982, landing.
   Shortly after landing, the estimated 138,000 motorhomes, cars and
trucks jammed the two narrow, one-lane blacktop roads that led to
the nearest highway, 30 miles from the vewing site.
   Remembering the five-hour traffic jam that followed the last
landing, Dube was one of hundreds poised for a quick getaway, and
was on the road right after the shuttle touched down.
   ``It's Saturday. If it was a work day I'd hang around a little
longer,'' he said.
   Spectators began gathering earlier in the week to stake out prime
viewing spots. The came in flag-bedecked motorhomes, aboard
motorcycles, and in cars pulling travel trailers.
   As many as 300 people who arrived after roads to the base were
closed simply pulled off the highway and drove onto the desert to
watch the landing. Several got stuck or damaged their axles when
they accidentally drove into holes in the desert hardpan.
   On Friday, the strains of country music blared over loudspeakers
at the makeshift campground as military helicopters buzzed overhead
and skateboarders rattled across the hardened lake bed.
   Pat Tolner, 35, a nurse from Annapolis, Md., witnessed the
shuttle lift off Monday in Florida.
   ``My husband wanted to know what I wanted for Christmas and I
told him I wanted to see the shuttle take off,'' she said. ``I spent
the night in the car and watched it take off, and when I got home I
told him I wanted to see it land. I flew to California Wednesday. I
rented a car and here I am.''
   Many of the early arrivals were so-called ``snowbirds,'' retired
couples who spend their winters in warm climates.
   ``We winter in the South every year and we just had to see the
shuttle land,'' said 74-year-old Bill Henderson of Sunnyside, Wash.,
who arrived with his wife, Evelyn.
   ``I'm sure we'd see it better on TV, but we just had to be
here,'' he said.

   A civilian cargo plane carrying military
explosives crashed in a field after takeoff from Carswell Air Force
Base early Saturday, killing the two crewmen aboard and igniting
numerous fires, authorities said.
   The crew notified Carswell of an in-flight emergency moments
before the plane went down, authorities said.
   The 21-year-old DC-9 owned by Oregon-based Evergreen
International Aviation crashed 20 minutes after takeoff. The crew
was attempting to turn back to Carswell when it crashed, said Tommy
McFall of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Investigators retrieved the flight data recorder from the
wreckage and were searching for the cockpit voice recorder.
   The plane was en route from Carswell, on the west side of Fort
Worth, to Tinker Air Force Base near Midwest City, Okla., on a
routine cargo flight, a company spokeswoman said. The crash site was
about seven miles north of Carswell.
   The plane was carrying 12,000 pounds of general cargo, including
military maintenance parts and 32 fuses used to detonate
conventional bombs, said Capt. Claudia Ziebis of the Air Force
Logistics Command.
   Senior Airman Mark Webb of Carswell said the fuses totaled the
equivalent of 11.52 pounds of explosives, ``which in relative terms
is a very, very small amount.''
   Lt. Brad Schuldt, deputy chief of public affairs at Carswell,
said some classified materials also were aboard.
   An ordnance team was sent from Dyess Air Force Base to dispose of
any fuses that survived the fire, Webb said.
   Schuldt said the NTSB would control the investigation and the
military would cooperate.
   Glen Youngblood, a rancher who lives next to the 4,000-acre ranch
where the DC-9 crashed, said debris was scattered over five acres.
   ``If it had been in a populated area, there would have been more
lives lost than two,'' said Youngblood, who drove his truck through
burning pastures searching for survivors. ``It would have destroyed
a lot of people and homes.''
   Donna Nelson, senior vice president of Evergreen, said the plane
made regular four-hour contract runs for the military among Kelly
Air Force Base, Carswell and Tinker. The company acquired the DC-9
in 1987 and had recorded no major maintenance problems, she said.
   Evergreen runs 125 bases worldwide and has operated military
contracts for 12 to 13 years, Ms. Nelson said.
   ``Only 10 percent of our work is military,'' Ms. Nelson said.
``We operate contracts for many major airlines, industries and the
American government worldwide.''
   ``Until today, we had the best safety record in the business,''
she said.
   The victims were identified as Capt. Gerald Jack McCall, 41, of
Del City, Okla., and Thomas Bill Johnston, 39, of Reno, Nev. McCall
was married and had four children. Ms. Nelson said Johnston was
engaged to be married.
   It was the third military-related crash in Texas in five months.
A B-1B bomber crashed Nov. 8 near Dyess and a KC-135 tanker crashed,
killing 19, near Dyess in February.

   Soldiers began distributing
ballots Saturday on the eve of national elections, but guerrillas
disrupted electrical power and transportation in an attempt to
discredit the balloting.
   The leftist guerrillas, however, assured the nation's nearly 1.8
million voters they will not be attacked if they go to the polls.
   The incumbent Christian Democrats hope to keep control of the
presidency, but they face a serious challenge by the right-wing
Republican National Alliance, known as Arena.
   A leftist political alliance on Saturday accused the military of
taking part in a smear campaign against it, but the military denied
the charge.
   Ruben Zamora, coordinator of the Democratic Convergence, said
about 100 posters condemning convergence members as ``communist
executioners'' were plastered Friday night along one of the
capital's main avenues.
   Col. Galileo Torres said ``no armed forces unit put them up'' and
that the military was ``keeping strictly to the sidelines in the
political process.''
   A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said
guerrilla military actions might be intense Sunday but that voters
will not be attacked.
   Broadcasts resumed of paid announcements by leftist organizations
the government considers guerrilla front groups, but the media
heeded an order from Attorney General Roberto Garcia not to air any
call to boycott the election.
   There were no new reports of rebel attacks overnight, but the
guerrillas maintained a ban on public transportation and sabotaged
electrical power, affecting the water supply in some places.
   Voters who defy a rebel boycott will have a chance to replace an
incumbent government with a different philosophy for the first time
in their history.
   They will be looking for someone who can bring an end to nine
years of civil war that left 70,000 dead and who can right a
crippled economy that has an unemployment and underemployment rate
of 60 percent.
   The three leading candidates offer options from right-wing
Arena's free market economics and tough stance against the
guerrillas to the left-wing alliance, which is linked to the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Another political choice is to observe the guerrilla boycott. The
rebels say they wants to discredit the election to show no solution
to the nation's political crisis is possible without their
participation.
   Troops began delivering ballots to polling places, but
authorities did not plan to distribute ballots to 24 of nation's 260
municipalities because they are under rebel control.
   Twenty-one U.S. election observers arrived Saturday. The group,
named by the White House, includes congressmen, state politicians
and private citizens.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democrats are trying
to retain power with attorney Fidel Chavez Mena, 49. He has had to
fight off accusations of corruption and incompetence against his
party, which has been unable to end the war or improve the economy.
   Duarte is dying of liver cancer. Under the constitution, a
president cannot seek re-election.
   Chavez Mena's major challenger is businessman Alfredo Cristiani
of Arena. The party was created in 1981 by Roberto d'Aubuisson, a
man accused of organizing death squads, links he denies. Many fear
he would be the power behind Cristiani's throne; his party already
controls the National Assembly.
   The new political factor is Guillermo Ungo, a former university
professor who spent seven years in exile as head of the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, which is allied with the guerrillas.
   Four minor candidates are not expected to be significant factors.
Cristiani has been leading the latest polls, but the large number of
voters who express no preference has led many to expect a runoff in
April between Cristiani and Chavez Mena.
   The new president will take office June 1 for a five-year term.
   The director of one of El Salvador's most respected polling
organizations denied a newspaper report that it predicted victory
for Cristiani.
   The Rev. Ignacio Martin Baro, head of the Public Opinion
Institute at Central American University, said its March 1 to 15
poll did not suggest a winner because too many people refused to
respond to questions due to ``Fear _ fear to express a preference.''
   Polltakers contacted 1,599 people, he said, but 41.5 percent
refused to indicate who they would vote for and 13 percent did not
plan to vote. He said 26.2 percent supported Cristiani, 12.9 percent
were for Chavez Mena and 4.2 percent preferred Ungo.
   In 1982 and 1984 elections, Salvadorans voters went to the polls
in large numbers despite the threat of violence by the left.
   In New York City, more than 1,200 sign-waving protesters marched
Saturday into Times Square to protest U.S. involvement in El
Salvador.
   ``The Bush administration (must) choose between negotiations or
an escalation of U.S. military involvement,'' said coordinator
Miguel Ramirez of the New Cork Coalition to Stop the U.S. War in El
Salvador.
   The guerrilla traffic ban started at midnight Wednesday, when
campaigning ended by law, and has halted highway traffic in most of
the country. Guerrillas launched sporadic attacks and called on
election workers to quit.
   More than 50 percent of the country was without electricity
because the guerrillas have destroyed light poles, transformers and
power lines. Phone lines also were down in many parts of the country.
   The guerrillas had offered to participate in the election if it
were postponed until September.

<HEAD>Ex-Prisoners Destroy Swimming Pool Where They Were Tortured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEDRO SERVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former political prisoners and a Roman
Catholic bishop used sledgehammers to demolish a swimming pool where
the prisoners said they had been tortured by being forced underwater
for long periods.
   In another development two opposition parties that had indicated
they might boycott national elections set for May 1 opened
conventions Saturday to select candidates.
   The public swimming pool, located in a city formerly named after
deposed President Stroessner, was destroyed Friday on orders of the
provisional president, Gen. Andres Rodriguez. The city, 235 miles
east of the capital of Asuncion, has been renamed the City of the
East.
   ``A black era in which human rights and respect for human and
Christian dignity were gravely wounded is ending,'' said the Rev.
Agustin Van Aaken, the bishop of Upper Parana who struck the second
blow to shatter the pool.
   Charles Casco, president of the city's appeals court, said ``they
are giving the final blows to something that symbolized the weeping
and pain of many people _ the torture pool.''
   Rodriguez came to power in a Feb. 3 coup, ousting Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner who ruled Paraguay for nearly 35 years. Stroessner fled
to Brazil.
   Rodriguez has promised to respect human rights. His interior
minister, Orlando Machuca Vargas, pledged to abolish police torture
facilities and to prosecute officials accused of participating in
human rights abuses.
   Reporters were invited to the city to watch the demolition of the
pool.
   A local government official, Juan Flores Gonzalez, lifted a
hammer to deliver the first strike.``The practice of torture has
ended forever,'' he said.
   Stroessner ruled this South America nation of about 4 million
people by relying on the military, militants in the governing
Colorado Party and police to crush dissent. Many political opponents
were harassed, jailed, tortured and exiled.
   Last week two police officers charged with torturing prisoners
were suspended and three municipal magistrates were arrested.
   In an anti-corruption campaign, five former Cabinet ministers and
seven people who served as aides to Stroessner have been charged
with crimes including fraud, bribery and embezzlement.
   The Revolutionary Febrerista and Christian Democratic parties
opened two-day nominating conventions Saturday.
   Fernando Vera, a possible presidential nominee for the
Febreristas, said his party ``could hardly expect to win'' but felt
it should challenge the Colorado Party, in power since 1947.
   Vera, 69, directed the Geneva, Switzerland, office of the
International Monetary Fund until his retirement in 1982.
   Christian Democrats are expected to nominate Secundino Numez as
their presidential candidate. Numez is a former Catholic priest and
a professor of theology and anthropology at the Catholic University.
   The Christian Democrats, Febreristas, Authentic Radical Liberal
Party and Popular Colorado Movement had formed the National Accord
coalition that opposed Stroessner's government.
   Gen. Rodriguez is the Colorado Party's presidential candidate and
is expected to win the election with the party retaining control of
Congress.
   The Authentic Radical Liberal Party is the largest single
opposition group and is to decide at a March 25-26 convention if it
will participate in the elections. Party President Domingo Laino has
indicated it probably will not.
   Laino has asked that the election be delayed for at least two
months, that voter registration be expanded and that coalitions such
as the National Accord be allowed to endorse candidates. The
government rejected or ignored those demands.

   The space shuttle Discovery
plunged out of space to a desert landing at dawn Saturday, ending an
almost flawless mission that included completion of NASA's satellite
communication system.
   ``Well done, Discovery. That's one to be proud of,'' capsule
communicator Frank Culbertson said.
   The shuttle, bearing a five-man crew, four crippled rats, 32
fertilized chicken eggs and other experiments, landed on schedule at
6:36 a.m. on a paved runway on Rogers Dry Lake, watched by a
near-record 460,000 spectators.
   ``NASA and the country's happy this morning. It's a beautiful day
in California,'' Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly, the space agency's
associate administrator, said after Discovery touched down.
   ``It's marvelous people can come out on such a pretty morning and
watch it,'' Truly added. ``I think the country realizes we're back.''
   The landing looked perfect, as promised from orbit when shuttle
commander Michael L. Coats, a veteran Navy aircraft carrier pilot,
radioed ``3 wire'' to mission control. He referred to the best
arresting cable for a plane to snag when landing on the deck of a
carrier.
   NASA television close-ups of the shuttle after its
1.9-million-mile trip showed numerous white marks on the black
thermal tiles that protect the shuttle's underside from the heat of
re-entry.
   But Truly described the damage as ``a few minor chips.''
   ``The vehicle is just as clean as it can be,'' Truly said at a
post-landing news conference.
   In December, the shuttle Atlantis suffered severe tile damage
when it was hit by insulation falling off a booster rocket and fuel
tank during the launch.
   About seven hours after Discovery landed, the astronauts and
their wives arrived in Houston, where they were greeted by their
children and a cheering crowd of about 500 people.
   Coats told the crowd of friends, fellow NASA workers and space
program fans that he ``had an awful lot to be thankful for and an
awful lot to be proud of.''
   All the crew members praised NASA employees for getting the
shuttle program back on track and for Discovery's performance.
   ``It was an awful lot of fun being out in space,'' said astronaut
Robert C. Springer, who added that all the crew members had waited a
long time to fly.
   The five-day mission's main objective, deployment of NASA's third
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, was accomplished Monday, the day
Discovery was launched from Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral,
Fla. Results of a variety of experiments carried out by the crew
awaited scientific analysis.
   The four rats with intentionally injured leg bones were killed
about four hours after landing, as were four others in a control
group kept on the ground, NASA spokeswoman Terri Sindelar said. The
dead rodents were sent to Orthopaedic Hospital in Los Angeles for
analysis, she said.
   The eggs were destined for an analysis of weightlessness on
embryo development. The student experiment was sponsored by Kentucky
Fried Chicken.
   ``The eggs are in wonderful shape. None are cracked. None are
broken,'' said company spokesman Richard Detwiler. He said half the
eggs were opened for study immediately while the remainder were
being flown to company headquarters in Louisville, Ky. One of the 16
allowed to hatch will go to the Louisville Zoo, while Purdue
University scientists will study the others.
   The crew of Coats, pilot John E. Blaha and mission specialists
James F. Buchli, James P. Bagian and Springer also shot miles of
film with a 70mm IMAX camera to document environmental damage on
Earth.
   Their last day began with a wake-up call from ground controllers
that included recordings of their children saying such things as
``Get up, dad, get out of bed, get to work.'' The astronauts
responded with a recording of Simon and Garfunkel's ``Homeward
Bound.''
   Other experiments included growing plants in microgravity, plus
growing protein crystals in a project aimed at developing new drugs.
   Discovery's flight was the 28th shuttle mission and the third
since the shuttle Challenger exploded after launch on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing its seven astronauts.
   The crowd that watched the landing was second in size only to the
500,000 who joined then-President Reagan in watching Columbia touch
down on July 4, 1982. Good weather, a weekend landing and the start
of spring vacation combined to more than double the anticipated
crowd, said NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   The $100-million TDRS, the third satellite placed in orbit,
completed the space agency's vital shuttle communications system,
which allows near-constant communication between shuttles and ground
controllers. The relay system also shortens what used to be a
15-minute blackout during the heat of re-entry to about three
minutes.
   The system also will allow NASA to shut down six ground stations
at an annual savings of $13 million.
   The only major hitch of the flight occurred Tuesday when one of
three hydrogen tanks feeding the fuel cells that generate
electricity for the shuttle developed erratic pressure. Unnecessary
lights and computers were shut off and controllers considered ending
the flight a day early. But by Wednesday the problem had been
corrected.
   The several miles of film shot with the IMAX camera will be made
into a movie documenting ocean pollution, flooding in Africa, burned
areas of the Florida Everglades and Western United States,
deforestation in Brazil, and erupting volcanoes in Southeast Asia
and South America.
   NASA had several options for landing, depending on the weather.
   If there had been a good cross wind, Discovery would have landed
on the hard clay lake bed runway to test crosswind handling.
   But wind died so the base's 15,000-foot-long, 300-foot-wide paved
runway was used so that tests of moderate brake pressure could be
conducted.
   The landing tests are intended to enable a resumption of landings
on the concrete runway at Kennedy Space Center, eliminating the need
to ferry shuttles back from Edwards atop a Boeing 747.

<HEAD>Communist Party to Form Shadow Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's large Communist Party announced Saturday it
will form a shadow government to convince voters it could
effectively govern the country.
   Achille Occhetto, party secretary, said the shadow government
will be composed of both Communist Party officials and intellectuals
or other specialists, and it will put forth ``policy and
governmental proposals.''
   Occhetto outlined the proposal in a speech opening the 18th
congress of the Italian Communist Party, or PCI, which is the
country's second-largest party but has suffered a steady slide in
votes.
   Occhetto, who took the party reins last summer, called for a
change in the composition of Italy's government, which for four
decades has been dominated by the conservative Christian Democrats
while the Communists have been kept out of governing coalitions.
   He appealed for new alliances with Roman Catholic groups and with
lay parties, particularly the four parties in the current governing
coalition led by the Christian Democrats.
   He also said the increasingly popular Green Party should look
beyond ecological issues and team with parties committed to
widespread reform.
   Turning to foreign affairs, Occhetto said the Communists had a
clear commitment to Italy's alliances with the West, particularly
NATO.
   At the same time, he said, ``we want to develop in a more open
and rich way a policy of dialogue and collaboration ... with the
party of (Soviet President) Mikhail Gorbachev, and with other
Communist parties committed to the democratization of the countries
they govern.''
   The Italian Communist Party broke with the Soviet Union in the
1970s and has since pursued its own course, which included an effort
to rule with the Christian Democrats in the mid-70s. Occhetto
suggested Saturday that that effort _ known as the ``historic
compromise'' _ was mistaken.
   The party has declined steadily in the polls over the past
decade, winning just 26.6 percent of the vote in parliamentary
elections in 1987 after nearly overtaking the Christian Democrats in
1976.
   Communist party members gathered in a Rome convention hall
applauded Occhetto when he called for the political rehabilitation
of Alexander Dubcek, the former Czechoslovak Communist Party leader
who introduced the ill-fated ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Dubcek was invited to the congress but Czechoslovak authorities
did not grant him a visa.

<HEAD>Report: DOE Renegotiating With Incoming SRP Operator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Energy is
renegotiating its contract with the next operator of the Savannah
River Plant in an attempt to better influence how the nuclear
weapons facility is run, according to a report published Saturday.
   Westinghouse Electric Co. will assume operation of the plant from
Du Pont on April 1. Last year, Westinghouse won a five-year, $6.7
billion contract from the Energy Department to run SRP.
   DOE sources and U.S. Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins wants to make the company more
accountable for its operations at the complex, The State newspaper
of Columbia reported Saturday.
   Officials said Watkins' goal is to ``restructure the
relationship'' between Westinghouse and the Energy Department, the
newspaper reported.
   Watkins reportedly wants to give the agency a more dominant role
and prevent a recurrence of operational problems that have plagued
Du Pont, which designed and built the 300-square-mile facility and
has operated it since 1950.
   All three reactors at the plant have been shut down since last
summer for safety upgrades, maintenance and establishment of new
operative procedures.
   The reactors are the nation's sole source of weapons-grade
tritium, a perishable gas vital to the production of nuclear
warheads.
   James Moore, president of Westinghouse Savannah River Co.,
acknowledged that the contract between the government and
Westinghouse is being renegotiated. He characterized the discussions
as amicable and said he saw no obstacle to completing them before
April 1.
   DOE officials and others have been alarmed by Westinghouse's
decision to bring in only 40 new managers at SRP after the company
had pledged to bring in ``several hundred,'' according to the
newspaper report.
   SRP has a total work force of about 17,000.
   ``My personal opinion is that 40 is not enough,'' said John
Ahearne, chairman of DOE's independent safety panel and former
chairman of the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   But Troy Wade, acting assistant secretary for the Energy
Department's defense program, said Friday he is satisfied that
Westinghouse will fulfill its commitments.

   A Lebanese Palestinian went on trial in absentia
Saturday on charges of organizing the 1982 attack on Rome's main
synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy and wounded 37 people.
   Abdel Osama Zomar was to be extradited from Greece to stand
trial, but the Greek government decided last December to deport him
to the country of his choice, saying he had been ``acting in the
struggle for the reacquisition of his country.'' He went to Libya.
   Police have not identified the gunmen who hurled grenades and
fired submachine guns at the synagogue on Oct. 9, 1982.
   Judges at Rome's criminal court questioned witnesses Saturday and
accepted a petition from Italy's Jewish community to be considered a
civil plaintiff in the case.
   Zomar, an alleged member of the terrorist faction led by Abu
Nidal, was arrested on the Greek-Turkish border in November 1982
while driving a car loaded with explosives.
   He was sentenced to 20 months for arms smuggling but remained
jailed during the long extradition process.
   The Greek supreme court approved an Italian extradition request
in November 1984 but it was never carried out. The extradition was
later overturned by the Greek justice minister, a decision protested
by Italy, the United States and Israel.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Banna, split with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in the early 1970s and heads a
group called the Fatah Revolutionary Council. His group is
responsible for attacks on Rome and Vienna airport in December 1985
that left a total of 20 people dead.

   The shooting at Southwest Middle School occurred Friday night as
about 500 people, mostly children, were leaving the school's talent
show.
   Police said they were looking for two cars that had been seen in
the area recently.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Seek To Unify Soweto and Johannesburg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders in
Soweto say a prolonged rent boycott is likely to continue until the
vast black township is unified economically and politically with
neighboring Johannesburg.
   A committee of activists, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, concluded in a new report that Soweto will never be able to
pay off a $300 million debt accumulated since most families stopped
paying rent and service charges in 1986.
   The committee is urging the white-controlled government to write
off the debt and create a single tax base for Johannesburg and
Soweto so money spent by blacks in Johannesburg can be returned to
their own community for development and services.
   ``No development policy for Soweto will succeed until
Johannesburg and Soweto are treated as one urban economy,'' said the
Rev. Frank Chikane, chairman of the seven-member committee, at a
news conference Thursday.
   Chikane, general-secretary of the South African Council of
Churches, said the proposal represents a fundamental challenge to
apartheid because a unified economy would entail a unified political
entity.
   ``The demand is actually for a normal country with normal
cities,'' he said. ``The system must be deracialized.''
   An estimated 2.5 million blacks live in Soweto, the country's
largest municipality. The white population of Johannesburg and its
adjacent suburbs is about 600,000.
   The rent boycott, launched to press grievances against the
government, has evolved into one of the most effective forms of
protest available to blacks under the 33-month-old state of
emergency.
   Authorites have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to break
the boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one in
August 1986 that led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a clash
with police.
   Chikane's committee said the Soweto town council should write off
rental arrears owed by householders, implement affordable service
charges, and establish a formula for transferring ownership of
rented homes to long-term occupants.
   A study released by the committee said Sowetans spend $400
million annually in Johannesburg, generating tax revenue that
benefits white residents without returning to Soweto.
   According to the study, businesses provide about 70 percent of
Johannesburg's tax revenue, enabling white homeowners to pay lower
service fees than Sowetans yet get better services.
   Compared to Johannesburg, Soweto has only a handful of licensed
businesses. The most common businesses in the township are
unlicensed grocery stores and pubs which pay no taxes.
   Chikane's committee already has met with the Soweto town council
and hopes to arrange a further meeting. The activists also want to
confer with the Johannesburg City Council.
   Soweto mayor, Sam Mkhwanazi has surprised the activists by
acknowledging their influence in the community. The committee
includes the general-secretary of the black miners' union, Cyril
Ramaphosa, and Albertina Sisulu, wife of jailed African National
Congress leader Walter Sisulu.

<TEXT>
   Police detained seven executives of
the Stari Trg lead mine in Kosovo province where ethnic Albanian
workers have been on strike for more than three weeks, Belgrade
television reported Saturday.
   The miners have ignored a federal order to return to work. They
went on strike Feb. 21 to protest planned constitutional changes
they say would limit the province's autonomy.
   Kosovo, where 85 percent of the people are ethnic Albanians, is
an administrative part of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic.
   The television report said the seven detained executives are
ethnic Albanians accused of counterrevolutionary activities and they
would be held for a month while an investigation continues.
   Two other directors of the Stari Trg mine were detained earlier
his month in what was seen as an effort to get the strikers to
return to work.
   Reports from Kosovo said that on Friday only ten maintenance
employees were on duty at the Stari Trg mine that has a normal work
force of 1,300.
   Hundreds of workers at the nearby Goles and Kisnica mines have
joined the strike.
   A compulsory work order was issued by Yugoslavia's federal
government on Feb. 27.
   The Tanjug news agency reported that Albanian students in Kosovo
were attending classes but refusing to speak.
   It also said Friday three students were sentenced to prison by a
court in Prizren, Kosovo's capital, for disseminating hostile
propaganda to ``destroy unity.'' It said the students of Albanian
descent were given sentences ranging from three to four years.
   The Kosovo Parliament is scheduled to meet on March 24 to approve
changes in the provincial constitution that would give Serbia much
greater control over the region.

<HEAD>Britain Issues New Security Orders to its Carriers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New security orders have been issued to all of
Britain's major airports, a Manchester airport spokesman said
Saturday. The orders came amid controversy over warnings received
before the December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The British news media said it was believed the new directive
requires passengers to remove all electric and electronic equipment
from luggage before check-in and to pack such items in hand luggage
to be examined at boarding gates.
   Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 on Dec.
21 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on the plane and
11 on the ground, was concealed in a radio-cassette player.
   A Manchester airport spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping
with British practice, said the orders were received Friday night
but he could not give details because it was a security matter.
   The Department of Transport would not say if a new directive had
been sent. But it reaffirmed a Feb. 18 message that advised all
airlines using British airports to begin asking travelers if their
baggage contained radios, computers or such equipment and then to
examine the items for possible explosives.
   The message did not say if examined items should be carried as
hand baggage or be checked through with other luggage.
   The Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher came under renewed attack Saturday for its handling of a
bomb warning before Flight 103 blew up.
   It was disclosed Friday that the Transport Department had
prepared a warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb
disguised in a radio-cassette player, but it did not mail the
advisory until after Christmas.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said the advice was of little
importance because similar information had been disseminated a month
earlier by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and by West
Germany.
   Flight 103 originated in West Germany and changed planes at
London's Heathrow airport before departing for New York.
   Early editions of two Sunday newspapers, The Observer and The
Sunday Telegraph, said the Dec. 19 warning carried several details
that would have helped security people spot a rigged radio-cassette
player.
   The Sunday Telegraph quoted Channon as saying, ``Yes, maybe the
security information contained in the December 19 letter should have
been sent out by telex. The reason this was not done was because the
crucial element of the message consisted of a color photograph of a
possible explosive device.''
   The opposition Labor Party on Saturday repeated its request for
an independent inquiry into the Flight 103 disaster. John Prescott,
Labor's transport spokesman, said Channon had caused ``muddle and
confusion'' over the issue of warnings.
   ``The relatives of those who died in the Lockerbie disaster have
the right to expect a full and open account of how the government
responded from the moment it received the warnings of a possible
terrorist attack,'' he said.
   Channon responded by saying Prescott was using the situation ``to
try and make party political points of the worst possible kind,
preying on the grief of bereaved people.
   ``We're trying to get to the bottom of this,'' Channon said on a
British Broadcasting Corp. broadcast.
   Conservative legislator Robert Adley on Friday replied to
criticism from the opposition and from families of the victims. He
said ``malicious Labor politicians, hysterical Americans and
news-hungry media'' had united in a ``witch hunt aimed at the
Conservative government in general and the secretary of state for
transport in particular.''

   Searchers who followed
directions given by executed killer Ted Bundy have found bones and
the tattered remnant of a blouse near a site where Bundy said he
buried a 17-year-old girl he killed in 1974.
   Wayne County Sheriff Kerry Ekker Wayne said Saturday the bones
were recovered from three separate sites just outside the boundaries
of this park 200 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   At one site, searchers found widely scattered bones and what
appeared to be a piece of a tan blouse with lace, Ekker said.
   ``We have our suspicions that the bones from the two locations
are not human, but there will have to be a positive identification
on all three,'' Ekker said. ``In one location we did find some
teeth, so we're sure it's an animal.''
   Sheriff's Chief Deputy Leeon Brinkerhoff said the remains would
be turned over to the Utah State Crime Laboratory for analysis.
   If any are found to be human, the sites will be carefully
excavated to preserve evidence. However, Ekker said a positive
identification would be possible only if a skull and teeth are found
so they can be compared with Wilcox's dental records.
   The bones were in a general area described by Bundy to detectives
who interviewed him at Florida State Prison in the days before his
Jan. 24 execution in the electric chair.
   Bundy was convicted of only three murders in Florida, but before
his execution he confessed to more than 20 killings and is
considered a suspect in more deaths and disappearances. Eight of
those he confessed killing were in Utah, but he gave descriptions of
only two of their burial sites.
   If the bones found are not human, Ekker said his office will make
only one more effort to recover the remains of Nancy Wilcox, who
disappeared from her Salt Lake City neighborhood on Oct. 2, 1974.
The sweep on Friday was the fourth since Bundy's death.
   Bundy confessed that he killed the girl and buried her between
Torrey and Fruita just outside the national park boundaries.
   Brinkerhoff said 28 members of the Wayne and Sevier County search
and rescue squads combed the area, marking any mound which might be
a grave. Of five mounds marked, three produced bones.

   More than 60 people were arrested Saturday when protesters
gathered in several cities and at a New Jersey military base to
protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador.
   Police arrested 28 people in Chicago, where about 250
demonstrators turned out in front of the Chicago Tribune offices,
and 40 people in New Jersey, where more than 300 demonstrators
marched on McGuire Air Force Base.
   In New York, more than 1,200 sign-waving protesters marched on
Times Square. No arrests were reported. Smaller demonstrations were
held in San Francisco and Providence, R.I.
   Leslie Schuld, an organizer of the Chicago demonstration, said
there were 60 such rallies being held across the country, but that
figure could not be independently confirmed. The actions were timed
to coincide with the presidential elections in El Salvador,
scheduled for Sunday.
   In New York, demonstrators gathered in Union Square, where they
heard a speech from Arnoldo Ramos of the FMLN-FDR, the Salvadoran
rebel alliance. U.S. Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., addressed the group
when it arrived in Times Square.
   ``It's going quite well. The feelings here are quite strong,''
said Michael D'Elia, spokesman for the New York Coalition to Stop
the U.S. War in El Salvador.
   The rally was to be followed by civil disobedience on Monday,
with protesters blockading a federal building in lower Manhattan.
   ``The Bush administration (must) choose between negotiations or
an escalation of U.S. military involvement,'' said coalition
coordinator Miguel Ramirez. ``Many fear a Vietnam-like disaster if
the administration chooses the latter course.''
   The rally in New Jersey was orderly at first, with 300 to 400
people gathering outside the front gate of the Air Force base in
southern New Jersey, base spokesman Ken Bogdan said.
   However, he said some protesters began climbing over gates and
fences to get into the base, and then sat down and refused to move.
Some were carried away, Bogdan said. No injuries were reported.
   ``The point of the demonstration was to be arrested to show we
are resisting the war with our bodies and feel so strongly against
this U.S.-financed war in El Salvador,'' said coalition spokeswoman
Kate Woods.
   Of the 28 people arrested in Chicago, three were charged with
disorderly conduct and the rest were charged with obstructing
traffic on Michigan Avenue, said police Sgt. Robert McCracken.
   Ms. Schuld said the demonstrators hoped to ``send a strong
message to the Bush administration and Congress to support peace in
El Salvador.''
   ``We're just not going to let business go on as usual,'' she
said, adding ``$3.6 billion has been sent to El Salvador over the
last eight years to support death squads.''
   The rally was held at the Tribune Tower to underline what Ms.
Schuld called ``very weak'' press coverage of events in the Central
American nation.
   In San Francisco, about 150 protesters marched in the rain from
the largely Hispanic Mission District to the Federal Building. No
one was arrested.
   About 100 people gathered in Providence to hear speakers at a
morning meeting at The First Baptist Church before a march to the
Providence Journal-Bulletin building.

   The first criminal trial stemming from Wall
Street's insider trading scandals faced the prospect of a second
mistrial when a jury on Saturday reported an 11-1 deadlock after
eight days of deliberations.
   A federal judge asked jurors in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation
case to reconsider all evidence after they reported the split
following more than 65 hours of deliberations.
   The GAF case is the first trial based on the confessions of
insider trader Ivan Boesky, which led to the indictment, and is
considered a test of the government's ability to try Wall Street
corruption.
   ``Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come to
a unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror who
does not agree,'' the jury reported in a note read in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
   The panel reported that the juror said ``under no circumstances''
could he agree with the other jurors' decision.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin are
charged with allegedly trying to boost the stock price of Union
Carbide Corp. in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of
shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy among the eight counts.
   Under an instruction known as the Allen charge, U.S. District
Judge Mary Johnson Lowe asked the jurors to reconsider their
positions in the securities fraud case and sent them back to
deliberate.
   ``Before I declare a mistrial and discharge you I want to point
out a few things to you,'' Lowe said. ``It is desirable that if a
verdict can be reached that this be done.''
   But Lowe told the jury that they should not reverse positions
solely to reach a verdict and left resolution to the ``conscientious
judgment of each juror.''
   After hearing the judge's statement, the jury said it wanted to
continue deliberating Sunday afternoon.
   The point of conflict among the jurors and whether the 11
supported acquittal or conviction were not known.
   A mistrial would be the second in the case. Lowe declared a
mistrial Jan. 10 after ruling that the prosecution unintentionally
withheld a key piece of evidence. The second trial lasted six weeks.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer, faces a maximum fine of $12 million, or $500,000 on
each of the eight counts. Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., faces 40
years in prison and a fine of up to $2 million.
   The GAF case is being closely followed by Wall Street defense
attorneys as a key indication of prosecutors' ability to convince
juries of Wall Street crimes, and of the reliability of information
supplied by Boesky, who is serving a three-year term on insider
trading charges.
   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize
GAF's profits from the planned sale of a large block of Union
Carbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical
concern earlier in 1986.
   GAF denied the charges in what became the first case to reach the
trial phase in a wave of Wall Street corruption investigations by
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   The U.S. attorney's office has brought charges in more than 50
securities fraud cases since 1983. Nearly all the claims, however,
have involved civil charges. Criminal frauds to date, including
pending charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., have been
settled through plea bargains.
   The government based its case on the testimony of Los Angeles
broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted felon expected to play a key
role in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea arrangement
with the government.

   President Bush on Saturday night joined in a
dinner where U.S. Lebanese and Syrian charities honored John Sununu,
and praised his feisty chief of staff as `` a class act.''
   In a quick trip out of the White House and back, Bush dropped by
the black-tie dinner where Sununu was feted by a ballroom full of
guests, including another American of Lebanese descent, entertainer
Danny Thomas.
   The dinner was hosted by a favorite charity of Thomas', the St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the American-Lebanese-Syrian
Associated Charities.
   In brief remarks, Bush told the group that he has ``deep
affection for Lebanon,'' and mentioned the country's longstanding
political turmoil.
   ``I have been there many times as a private citizen before I got
involved in public life. And I expect every American looks at
Lebanon today with agony in his heart and concern hoping that he or
she in some way can find a way to make a difference. And I just
wanted you to know that as president, I want to find a way,'' Bush
said.
   As for Sununu, who has taken some lumps for a few rough spots
early in the Bush administration, Bush said he has learned a lot
about his top aide.
   ``He is a class act,'' Bush said.
   He congratulated the gathering for honoring Sununu.
   Joining Thomas and Sununu on the dais was United Press
International White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who is also of
Lebanese descent.
   Bush plucked the 49-year-old Sununu from the governor's chair in
New Hampshire to be his chief of staff at the White House. Sununu
was a top campaign adviser to Bush last year.
   A former engineer, he served as governor from 1983 until joining
the Bush administration.

   Iran's prime minister on Saturday
denounced the International Civil Aviation Organization's refusal to
condemn the United States for downing an Iranian airliner last July,
killing all 290 people aboard.
   Official Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Mir Hussein
Musavi as saying that ``if anywhere in the world an American had
lost a little blood, these same international organizations and
global communities would not let go of the matter.
   ``But the killing of 290 people ... is shirked away by a simple
apology,'' the radio quoted Musavi as saying.
   The U.N. agency made its declaration in Montreal Friday after an
eight-month examination of the incident, in which the USS Vincennes
shot down the airliner after mistaking it for an attacking Iranian
warplane.
   The agency rejected the request for censure by the Soviet Union
and Czechoslovakia. Without blaming any country, it adopted a
resolution that reaffirmed its policy of condemning the use of
weapons against civil aircraft.
   The agency deplored ``the tragic incident which occurred as a
consequence of events and errors in identification of the aircraft.''
   Edmund Stohr, the U.S. representative to ICAO, applauded the
decision, calling it ``a judgment that is balanced and treats the
truth fairly.''
   Musavi was quoted as saying the agency's refusal to denounce the
United States showed that ``the law of the jungle rules in the
international organizations, and our nation rejects this domination
(of) strength.''

   The Soviet Council of Ministers decided in January to close the

   Local environmentalists had fought to close the plant for years.

<HEAD>Records of Historic Forum On Eurocommunism to Be Published</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The records of a historic 1956 forum of
Hungarian intellectuals who espoused views later known as
Eurocommunism will be published this year, speakers at an academic
meeting said Saturday.
   In 1956, before the uprising against Communist rule that same
year, a circle of university students and other intellectuals
organized seven gatherings to discuss a variety of political,
economic and cultural themes.
   Texts of the lectures and debates of the Petoefi Circle, named
after the 19th century poet Sandor Petoefi, have never been
published.
   The forum proposed reforms adopted by the Eurocommunists more
than 10 years later. Eurocommunism advocated independence from the
Soviet Union and democratic elections.
   Speakers at Saturday's meeting of about 500 people, including
many Petoefi Circle supporters, said the full minutes of the forum
would be published between June and September.
   The meeting, called to discuss the importance of the Petoefi
Circle in Hungary's contemporary history, was announced in the
Hungarian press, which has recently become increasingly open.
   One of the organizers was Andras Hegedues, a sociologist who was
prominently involved in the 1956 forum and kept records of the
debates for eventual publication.
   ``We wanted reforms, we certainly did not want a
counterrevolution, but it should also be admitted that we did not
want a revolution either,'' Hegedues told participants.
   The 1956 uprising has officially been described as a
counterrevolution designed to break Communist rule. But Politburo
member Imre Pozsgay and other reformers have called it a popular
uprising, setting off a fierce debate in the party on the sensitive
issue.
   A recent party Central Committee session issued a statement
saying the 1956 revolt began as a popular uprising but later turned
into a counterrevolution.

   A convicted robber held a judge
hostage for four hours after she gave him an eight-year prison
sentence, news reports said Saturday.
   Police later overpowered the man and freed the judge.
   Luka Bosnjak, 29, serving a five-year term for previous offenses,
was being tried by judge Vesna Benjak for hostage-taking while in
prison, the news reports said. The trial was in the northern town of
Varazdin.
   When the judge announced her verdict, lengthening Bosnjak's
remaining term from four to 12 years, the convict apparently went
beserk, the reports said. He broke away from his guards, grabbed the
judge, held a knife to her throat, ordered the courtroom emptied and
demanded a getaway car with a driver, a rifle with 10 bullets and
$1,250.
   After four hours, special police units managed to overpower the
man and free the judge, the reports said. The judge suffered minor
cuts on her palms.
   Other details of the courtroom drama were not reported.

   When Philip B. Petersen was convicted in
1986 of stealing more than $200,000 worth of historical documents
from the Thomas A. Edison National Historic Site, he promised to
give all the artifacts back.
   Petersen, 68, admitted Friday that he hadn't kept his word.
   The former Stanford University professor pleaded guilty to
selling more artifacts from the museum, admitting that he had hidden
some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three
years ago.
   Petersen, of Redwood City, Calif., faces up to 20 years in prison
after entering the plea in U.S. Federal District Court.
   Federal officials said Petersen visited the museum in West
Orange, N.J., about 30 times between 1974 and 1976 on the pretense
that he was conducting historical research on Edison's invention of
the phonograph.
   In 1985, officials seized $200,000 worth of letters, artifiacts,
sketches and equipment from Petersen's home after being tipped by a
North Carolina collector who had bought several documents from him.
   Petersen pleaded guilty to stealing the documents, and was
sentenced to two months in prison and five years probation. He is
currently in the third year of that probation, officials said.
   The plea agreement required Petersen to turn over all of the
stolen artifacts to federal officials. But officials recently were
tipped by a California collector that Petersen had asked to be put
in touch with Japanese customers who might be interested in Edison
artifacts.
   In a raid last October, federal agents recovered more than 180
Edison-related items from Petersen's house.
   ``The first time around, because there was such a large amount of
items recovered, it was impossible to tell if there was anything
left,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McCarthy. ``We believe
this is it, though.''
   Fahy Whitaker, superintendent of the West Orange historic site,
said many of the items recovered in the two FBI raids were ``one of
a kind things.''
   ``They all add to our understanding of Edison and how he
worked,'' Ms. Whitaker said. ``We're happy we've gotten these back,
but we know there is more out there. He sold a lot of it.''

<HEAD>Polls Find Vast Majority Support Ban On Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of Americans favor a ban on
semiautomatic assault weapons, although there is no consensus on how
such a ban should work, according to two polls released Saturday.
   A nationwide survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times found that
80 percent of Americans favored banning such weapons. A Newsweek
poll showed that 72 percent favor a permanent ban on selling them,
while 21 percent opposed such a ban.
   The Times poll found opposition to the sale and possession of the
rapid-firing weapons across political, ethnic, gender, geographical
and educational lines, said survey director I.A. Lewis.
   However, given several suggestions for how to remove the guns
from society, respondents split three ways. Twenty-four percent said
the guns should be confiscated from present owners, 30 percent
supported buying the guns back and 30 percent would allow present
owners to keep their guns but ban new sales.
   More than half of the 1,158 people polled in the Times' telephone
survey said only law-abiding citizens would obey the ban, leaving
the weapons mainly in the hands of criminals.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage
points, Lewis said.
   According to the Newsweek poll, 58 percent of Americans believe a
ban would reduce the number of killings by unstable people, the
magazine said. However, half of those polled said they did not
believe such a ban would reduce drug- or crime-related killings,
while 45 percent said they believe it would help.
   Seventy-eight percent of those surveyed said they believe people
should be required to provide more information to police before they
are allowed to buy any kind of firearm, while 15 percent said they
believe current laws are adequate.
   The telephone pole of 756 adults was conducted March 16-17 and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.
   The issue gained national prominence in January after a suicidal
gunman killed five children and wounded 30 other people in a
Stockton schoolyard.
   The California Assembly has approved a bill banning 40 types of
assault weapons and the Bush Administration has imposed a temporary
ban on the import of foreign-made assault weapons.

<HEAD>Report: Thornburgh To Dismantle Anti-Mafia Strike Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh tentatively has
decided to abolish most or all of the government's special strike
forces established decades ago to fight the Mafia, according to a
published report.
   In its Sunday editions, The New York Times reported that
Thornburgh is planning to dismantle the 24 regional Organized Crime
Strike Forces because he believes the job can best be done by local
U.S. attorneys.
   Thornburgh told the Times in an interview that the problem with
strike forces ``is that they are an independent field office of the
Department of Justice that competes with the U.S. attorneys.''
   The proposal is supported by most of the nation's 94 U.S.
attorneys but is meeting resistance from about 130 strike force
attorneys, the Times said.
   The strike force lawyers argue that U.S. attorneys have limited
resources for combating organized crime and that they lack personnel
familiar with or experienced with dealing with such activity, the
newspaper reported.
   The proposal, which is under study by Edward S.G. Dennis, head of
the Justice Department's criminal division, already has the
tentative approval of Thornburgh, the paper reported.
   Dennis strongly advocates abolishing the strike forces, the paper
said.
   The local U.S. attorneys are pressing for a system similar to one
already in use in the Southern District of New York, where the
strike force attorneys were merged into the local office and no
longer reported directly to Washington D.C.
   Supporters of the New York system credit it for allowing former
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani to successfully prosecute several
Mafia cases.
   In the interview, Thornburgh said he would prefer to replace the
strike forces with a ``cadre of experienced prosecutors'' who could
be dispatched to work with local U.S. attorneys when needed.
   The Times said Thornburgh will decide the future of the strike
forces in a few weeks.
   The strike forces originated in the 1960s under then-U.S.
Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The strike forces were to marshal
the resources of the FBI, other federal agencies, local law
enforcement agencies in ridding Mafia influence in a region.
   The strike forces operated out of Washington D.C. because most
organized crime activity extends beyond state borders.
   Thornburgh's proposal is not new. Former Attorney General Edwin
Meese unsuccessfully tried to dismantle the strike forces.
   Thornburgh was a U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh from 1969 to 1974.
As a prosecutor there, he gained attention by jailing many
middle-level members of the Mafia.

   A woman who was left severely brain damaged and a

has been awarded $10 million in a medical malpractice suit.
   The award to Blanca Lilliana Naranjo, 21, was handed down this

Her suit alleged negligence on the part of South Miami Hospital and
its doctors and nurses.
   Ms. Naranjo, then 18, was riding her bicycle when she was struck
by a hit-and-run driver on April 22, 1986. She was admitted to the
hospital's intensive care unit for treatment of her leg fracture and
developed a complication known as fat embolism syndrome.
   The condition causes a buildup of fluid in the lungs, interfering
with breathing.
   Her lawyer, Michael Mullen, said the condition is not an uncommon
reaction to a broken leg and can be corrected with oxygenation and
ventilation if recognized in time. But he said the hospital's
doctors failed to identify the condition until she had gone into
cardiac arrest.
   ``She was in a coma for 2{ months,'' Mullen said, and ``left a
permanent, total 100 percent disabled spastic quadriplegic with
brain damage.''
   The Colombian native, who had been an honor student fluent in
three languages, was hospitalized more than eight months and now can
only speak a few words, Mullen said. Ms. Naranjo has $1.1 million in
hospital bills and will need complete care the rest of her life,
Mullen said.

   The Indian air force on Saturday
displayed its firepower and tactical skills with some of the Soviet
Union's most sophisticated combat aircraft.
   About 200 guests, including representatives from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, were at
the training field for the two-hour demonstration. Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, a former pilot, watched through binoculars.
   Defense Ministry officials said the demonstration was to show the
capabilities of the country's combat planes and to encourage young
men to consider a military career. The air show was televised
nationally.
   India has 115,000 men and more than 700 aircraft in its air
force. Most of the planes were acquired from the Soviets.
   Foreign military experts have rated the skills of Indian air
force pilots as among the world's best, but they give the service
low marks for aircraft maintenance, citing the lack of engineers and
delays in obtaining spare parts.
   Flying 124 planes from 10 bases in the states of Uttar Pradesh,
Haryana and Punjab, the air force opened the show with supersonic
runs by European-made Jaguar and Soviet-made MiG-27 jet fighters and
a flyover by MiGs and French-made Mirage 2000s.
   In New Delhi, 17 miles away, windows and walls in some houses
rattled from the sound waves.
   The pilots demonstrated an array of ground-attack weapons,
including cluster bombs and 57mm rockets, but smoke forced officials
to scratch at least two of the 12 events and parts of others because
pilots could not see the targets.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Majority See Abortion As Immoral But Often Necessary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Americans think abortion is
immoral, but they also firmly believe that each woman should be free
to make her own decision about abortion, according to a nationwide
poll.
   The survey published in Sunday's editions of the Los Angeles
Times also showed overwhelming opposition to any Constitutional
amendment outlawing abortion, with 62 percent against such a move
and 28 percent for it, said poll director, I.A. Lewis.
   The poll was taken as anti-abortion groups prepare for a series
of protests this week, with pro-abortion groups planning counter
demonstrations.
   The poll noted, however, that American public opinion has been
largely unswayed by the intense and often unruly debate over
abortion, showing opinion is about the same as a decade ago.
   Sixty-one percent of 3,583 people surveyed by the Times poll said
they believe abortion to be ``morally wrong,'' while 22 percent said
it is ``morally right.'' Another 24 percent were unsure.
   Fifty-seven percent said they felt ``abortion is murder,'' while
35 percent disagreed with that judgement.
   But 74 percent agreed with a key statement: ``I personally feel
that abortion is morally wrong, but I also feel that whether or not
to have an abortion is a decision that has to be made by every woman
for herself.'' The poll showed 21 percent disagreed with the
statement and 5 percent were unsure.
   Overwhelming majorities favored abortion when a woman's life was
threatened by her pregnancy (88 percent), when the pregnancy
resulted from incest (84 percent), and when a serious birth defect
was detected (74 percent).
   But most opposed abortion as a means of birth control (80
percent), and when an unmarried woman doesn't want to marry the
father (51 percent). Only 49 percent opposed abortion when the
family is poor and can't afford more children.
   Compounding the conflicting findings was lukewarm support, 46
percent against 35 percent opposed, for the Supreme Court's
16-year-old ruling making abortion legal.
   The telephone poll surveyed 2,406 adults of both sexes in a
cross-section sample and another 1,177 women, Lewis said. The second
sample was added because of abortion's special significance to
women, but was adjusted to fit properly into a normal percentage mix
of men and women, he said.
   The survey's margin of error was 3 percent.

   Donna Rice says she has ``basically lost
everything'' since her notorious liaison with former Sen. Gary Hart,
and now wears false buck teeth and sunglasses so people won't
recognize her.
   ``It's just been real hard,'' the model said Saturday in a speech
at the 15th annual Institute on the Ethics of Journalism at
Washington and Lee University. ``I do live in a state of having to
watch my every move. ... Imagine the kind of person you most dislike
and think of people thinking of you as that kind of person.''
   Ms. Rice blamed her predicament on irresponsible reporters,
although she noted that some journalists maintained professional
conduct. She said she agreed to appear at the seminar only because
she hoped to help others avoid similar experiences.
   ``I basically lost everything I had worked for all of my life,''
she said _ her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood.
   Ms. Rice said she has tried to stay out of the public spotlight
after being ``basically a fugitive for months. ... a prisoner of
perception.''
   She said she is recognized frequently in public, and has tried to
hide her appearance by pulling her hair back.
   In addition, she added. ``I have a disguise. I have buck teeth
that I put on. They cost me 80 bucks. You guys want to see?''
   When the audience said yes, Ms. Rice donned a pair of glasses,
bent over and inserted the false teeth. She stood upright, looking
like quite a different person.
   ``I hope,'' she said, ``time will eventually take care of all of
this.''
   Ms. Rice's liaison with Hart destroyed Hart's bid for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination. Hart withdrew from the race in
May 1987.

<TEXT>
   A chiropractor has agreed to stop
advising patients their health problems are caused by demons, evil
spirits or other supernatural creatures, a state official said.
   Lee Walden, owner of a chiropractic clinic that bears his name,
also was placed on six months probation and agreed to stop
advertising and performing a sinus treatment in which a balloon is
inserted into the nose and inflated until it bursts, said Jim
Gallagher, a deputy attorney general for consumer protection.
   The agreement between Walden, the State Board of Chiropractic
Examiners and the state Attorney General's Office was signed March
10, Gallagher said Friday. It culminated a three-year investigation
in which Walden was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination, he
added.
   The attorney general's office first sought an emergency
suspension of Walden's license in January 1986 after a woman filed a
complaint alleging that the chiropractor had blamed a patient's
overeating on possession by demons, according to state records.
Walden also told the woman her husband and her mother were
possessed, records show.
   The chiropractic board blocked that suspension. However, a
follow-up investigation revealed Walden had used the balloon
treatment and advertised it in the Yellow Pages between 1983 and
1987. He also had told patients their health problems were caused by
demonic possessions, the investigation found.

<TEXT>
   Seven Anglican church officials led by
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu backed the Sandinista
government's recent reform measures Saturday and called on
Washington to help resettle the rebels.
   The clerics, who arrived in Nicaragua Tuesday, issued a statement
that was read by the Rev. Edmond Browning, primate of the Episcopal
Church of the United States.
   The statement asked that funds provided by the U.S. government to
help Honduras-based Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, ``be used
to repatriate or relocate (the rebels) in other countries.''
   It said, ``We reject using this aid to maintain the Contras in
Honduras.''
   The Central American presidents signed a peace proposal Feb. 14
that seeks ways to disband the Contras and promote democratic
reforms by Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Washington has supported the rebels since 1981 and the U.S.
Congress is set to vote next month on additional humanitarian aid to
the estimated 11,000 Contras in Honduras. President Bush is asking
about $4 million a month for the rebels.
   Browning said he will carry a message back to Bush based on his
observations.
   ``I hope that I will be able to do it in a manner that he will
understand,'' Browning said.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his active
opposition against South Africa's policy of segregation, headed the
delegation that came to Nicaragua at the invitation of the Rev.
Sturdie Downs, bishop of Nicaragua's Episcopal Church.
   The delegation's statement praised recent measures taken by the
government as contributing to ``reconciliation and peace.''
   Among those measure was the release last week of nearly 1,900
former national guardsmen and the decision to allow 10 clergymen to
return to Nicaragua. Most of the guardsmen had been in prison since
the Sandinistas won a civil war and ousted the conservative
government of President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   Browning said his visit to Nicaragua ``will cause certain
conflicts among members of the Episcopal Church'' in the United
States but he added he would be willing to return to Nicaragua ``to
help the people in the reconstruction of their faith as well as
social justice.''
   Members of the Anglican group met with President Daniel Ortega,
leaders of the political opposition, religious officials and
newspaper editors. They also visited the Caribbean coastal city of
Bluefields to see the damage cause by Hurricane Joan last October.
   They travel to Panama on Sunday.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Plans Strike Force to Combat Drugs in Washington DC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug director William J. Bennett is
making plans for a federal-local strike force to give ``shock
treatment'' to drug-infested areas of Washington D.C., according to
a published report.
   Bennett, who was sworn in Monday as the nation's first director
of national drug control policy, had said he may make the District
of Columbia a ``test case'' in the war against drugs. The district
has had 114 murders so far this year as Saturday, and most were
drug-related.
   The Washington Post, in Sunday's editions, quoted aides to
Bennett as saying that the strike force would target repeat drug
offenders and try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets.
   Also, abandoned military facilities could be converted into
temporary prisons to provide more space to house the large number of
drug offenders officials expect to arrest during the anticipated
crackdown, the newspaper said.
   The paper quoted a source as saying that the strike force, which
could be created as soon as next month, would perform simultaneous
drug busts in specific neighborhoods. ``These are going to be
targeted operations . . . We're not just going to commit 5,000
people to the streets of D.C.,'' the source said.
   The Antidrug Abuse Act of 1988 authorizes Bennett to declare
certain cities ``high intensity drug trafficking areas'' and to
temporarily reassign federal personnel to those areas to work with
state and local officials.
   Some local law enforcement officials have questioned if the
district qualifies as a ``high intensity'' drug area.
   However, District Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr. said the
plan was ``encouraging news... We arrest them but they don't go to
jail, they don't fear jail. If the federal government assists us by
sending them to jail, it certainly will help.''
   Bennett had said Friday he did not plan to displace the local
police department, but that the federal government would seek to aid
local efforts.
   The strike force will include agents borrowed from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Marshals Service, as well
as district and county police departments, the paper said.
   Bennett appointed Sherwood ``Chuck'' Wexler to serve as a liaison
for the agencies and a draft of the plan is expected within three
weeks, with a formal announcement to come later.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 people marched through
downtown Saturday to protest the recent slaying of a 12-year-old
girl, which demonstrators blamed on an increase in crack cocaine use.
   Felisha Smith, a resident of Pascagoula's Carver Village
neighborhood, was found stabbed to death Tuesday in an abandoned
building on U.S. Highway 90. Her neighbors believe the death is
somehow linked to drug dealing and a local hotel they say has become
a haven for crack dealers.
   Police say they are still investigating the death and have not
determined whether drugs played a role.
   Paul Whiteurs, Pastor of the Asbury Chapel of the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, helped organize Saturday's
demonstration. He said the marchers were protesting inaction by the
police and other authorities.
   ``We're protesting status quo,'' he said. ``If children can
identify the crack houses, the police should be able to.''
   There were protests and picketing in Carver Village on Thursday
and Friday, centered around the King William Hotel. A group of local
residents had sought to close the hotel months before the girl's
death, although its insist the hotel isn't a crack house.
   Police tried to close the hotel by getting it declared a public
nuisance. However, the hotel countersued, and the case is pending in
Chancery Court, a police spokesman said Saturday.

<TEXT>
   A Circuit Court jury ruled Saturday that John
R. Weber was sane during the torture-murder of his sister-in-law in
1986 and an attempt to murder his wife two years later.
   The jury's rejection of Weber's insanity plea means he faces a
mandatory sentence of life in prison for first-degree murder rather
than commitment to a mental institution.
   Weber, 25, of Phillips, could also get up to 300 years in prison
for other crimes related to the attacks on the two women.
   Weber, who worked as a maker of Christmas wreaths, mutilated and
killed his wife's sister, Carla Lenz, 17, in 1986, and eventually
described the slaying in a tape recording with which to intimidate
his wife, police testified.
   The missing girl's grave was not discovered until police began
investigating a beating that sent his wife to a hospital last
September.
   His 22-year-old wife and his mother were in the courtroom during
Saturday's psychiatric testimony and closing arguments.
   The psychiatric testimony marked the trial's second phase. In the
first phase, the jury found Weber guilty of mutilating and sexually
assaulting Miss Lenz. Saturday it ruled him sane on the same charges
after deliberating 1{ hours.
   Weber had pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murdering Miss Lenz
and attempting to murder his wife on Sept. 3, 1988, near her
sister's grave. He later pleaded innocent by reason or mental
disease or defect to all charges.
   Judge Gary Carlson set no date for sentencing. Defense attorney
John Reid said he intended to appeal the verdicts in both trial
phases.

   A ride that simulates the effects
of a massive earthquake on a San Francisco subway station opened
Saturday on the Universal Studios tour.
   The $13 million attraction, called the ``Big One,'' is designed
to mimic a quake of magnitude 8.3 on the Richter scale, estimated by
seismologists to equal the magnitude of the devastating 1906 San
Francisco shock.
   Universal Studios tram riders are treated to fears of unstable
earth, live burial, electrocution, fire, drowning, darkness and
abandonment in just two minutes, 25 seconds.
   ``We outlined seven basic terrors we wanted to scare up in the
tourists,'' said ride designer Larry Lester, who did the set for the
1974 movie ``Earthquake.'' ``We want people to run the gamut from
uncertainty about what's happening to them, to disbelief to absolute
fright.''
   Attendance at the amusement park was estimated at 22,000,
according to Universal spokesman Jim Yeager.
   That was about double the previous Saturday's attendance, but
Yeager said it wasn't possible to tell how many were attracted to
the jolting ride. Saturday also was the beginning of Easter Vacation
for many youths, he added.

   Millie, the first dog, is expecting pups any
day and doesn't like her new digs, so Barbara Bush has banished the
president to Abe Lincoln's bedroom.
   So, President Bush said Friday, he's spending the night alone.
   ``The dog refuses to go to the doghouse is the problem,'' Bush
told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One.
   Bush, who spent Thursday night in a hotel room in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said he has been banished by his wife, Barbara, from
sleeping in their usual bed in the White House.
   He said, instead, he would sleep in the historic Lincoln Bedroom
several doors away.
   He told reporters that, when he called the first lady, ``Barbara
told me `Tonight, you're in the Lincoln bed _ alone.' I said `why?'
She said, `well, Millie had a very bad night last night thrashing
around. And you would be irritable.'''
   ``So I'm being sent down the hall _ which just suits me fine.''
   Millie, an English spaniel, is due to have her pups at any
moment. Bush said, judging from her size, he guesses that the dog
will have about six puppies _ and he'll be glad when it's all over.
   He said that the dog adamantly refuses to use ``a beautiful pen
made for her to have this blessed event in,'' and insists on
remaining in the White House master bedroom.
   ``I never thought we'd go through something like this again _
after six kids and 11 grandchildren. But it's a whole new thing.''
   Bush said that the upcoming event is complicated by the
attachment that exists between the first lady and the first dog.
   ``She can't move without the dog being 10 feet way from her,''
Bush grumbled.
   But, he added, ``it's exciting.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Satisfied With Israeli Assurances On Indicted Spy Handler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is satisfied with
assurances that an Israeli air force officer indicted in the
espionage case of Jonathan J. Pollard is not employed by an Israeli
firm which supplies the U.S. military, a Pentagon official said
Friday.
   The Pentagon had sought clarifications from Israel after a news
report that the officer, Col. Aviem Sella, joined Electro Optics
Industries, which manufactures sophisticated optical devices,
including night vision equipment for pilots.
   The inquiry was undertaken because under Pentagon policy, the
U.S. government might have had to cancel its contracts with the
Israeli firm because of a ban on dealings with an indicted
individual, like Sella.
   The Pentagon has seen a letter from the chief executive officer
of Electro Optics saying Sella was not employed by the company, said
the official, who spoke on condition he not be named.
   ``We have no information to contradict that letter,'' he said.
``As far as we're concerned, that closes the issue.''
   Sella was indicted on charges he acted as the handler for
Pollard, a civilian Navy intelligence analyst convicted in 1987 of
selling thousands of secrets to Israel. Pollard is serving a life
sentence.
   Sella is one of several Israelis involved in the affair whom the
United States is seeking to prosecute. Israeli officials have held
periodic talks with the Justice Department on clearing up the
lingering controversy but have failed to reach agreement.
   Sella returned to Israel before his indictment and was appointed
commander of a large air force base, despite U.S. objections. In
keeping with Pentagon policy, U.S. officials and contractors acting
on government business were banned from any dealings with Sella.
   That fact, combined with his inability to come to the United
States on business, reportedly hindered Sella in his job.
   The weekly Defense News reported last week that Sella left the
military earlier this year and joined Electro Optics on March 1. The
company, one of Israel's leading exporters, has a $10 million
contract with Martin Marietta Aerospace to supply night vision
equipment for the Apache attack helicopters. ElOp also supplies
sight displays for jet pilots' visors which allows them to fly at
night.
   In response to the Defense News report, ElOp director Nathan
Sharoni wrote a letter to the weekly denying that Sella was employed
by the company ``in any capacity.'' That same letter was brought to
the attention of the Pentagon, said the defense official.
   ``It is true we did intend to employ him as a consultant,''
Sharoni wrote, ``but this intention did not materialize.'' Israeli
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision not
to employ Sella appeared to stem from strong indications that the
United States would object.

   Former Democratic Rep. Bill Chappell
Jr. announced Friday that he is being treated for bone cancer but
intends to resume his law career.
   ``I want all my friends to know I'm feeling fine and plan to see
them back in the district soon,'' Chappell said in a news release
from the law offices of Coble and Barkin in Daytona Beach.
   Irene Haske, a spokeswoman for the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical
Center in Bethesda, Md., said Chappell, 67, was admitted to the
hospital Feb. 23 by the National Cancer Institute and was in stable
condition.
   Chappell's stepson Charles McBurney, an assistant state attorney
in Jacksonville, said the former congressman has had bone cancer for
several years and is primarily in the hospital because he is
receiving new medication.
   McBurney, whose mother is Chappell's second wife Jeane, said
knowledge of Chappell's cancer has been kept in the family.
   ``He doesn't want anyone to treat him any differently,'' McBurney
said. ``He's very upbeat and so is my mother. They are very
optimistic.''
   Chappell, who served in Congress for 20 years, was defeated in
his bid for and 11th term in November by Republican Craig James.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Drug Fight Doesn't Mean Federal Police for Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug-control director William J.
Bennett, who says he may make the District of Columbia a ``test
case'' in the war against drugs, said Friday his plans don't include
federal control of the local police.
   The city's soaring number of murders _ 114 as of Friday, with
many of them drug-related _ has prompted talk on Capitol Hill by two
senators that perhaps the local police department should be replaced
with a federally controlled police force. District officials have
expressed fear that they may lose control over their city.
   But Bennett said in an interview, ``We have no plan to displace
the Washington, D.C., Police Department, which I actually think has
done pretty well. I think Chief (Maurice) Turner's made valiant
efforts here.''
   On Monday, the day Bennett was sworn in as the nation's first
director of national drug control policy, he told a news conference
that in the next few weeks he may declare Washington, recently
becoming known as the nation's murder capital, a ``high intensity
drug trafficking area.'' Such a designation would allow him to
allocate federal personnel and cash to combat the problem.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., on Thursday blamed the city's crime
wave on ``inept local government that doesn't understand what it's
doing'' and said that if the killing continues he will consider
taking ``a look at home rule, at least the law enforcement aspect.''
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., supported Rudman's remarks.
   City officials worried aloud that home rule, the right to
self-governance that city residents obtained in 1973, may be more
vulnerable now than ever before.
   ``If the federal government thinks it can do a better job of
stopping drugs from coming into the city, why can't they do a better
job of stopping drugs from entering the country?'' asked Mayor
Marion Barry Jr.
   Bennett said Friday, ``I certainly don't think we're going to
solve this problem by taking over from the city.''
   ``Our effort ... will not be to say D.C. is no more and we're
taking it over,'' he said. ``It will be to say, `We're going to
help. We'd like to get in and help and get out.'''
   In the long run, Bennett said, ``what's going to sustain
Washington is not going to be federal agencies or drug czars. It's
going to be its own people, their neighborhoods, their communities,
their governments. They've got to stand on their own feet, run their
own community. They have to take back the streets. ... We might be
able to help in the interim.''

<HEAD>Rock 'n' Roll Pioneer Bobby Mitchell Dead at 53</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bobby Mitchell, who as a young musician helped
introduce rock 'n' roll into American pop culture, died early Friday
of kidney failure. He was 53.
   ``He was the godfather of rock and roll in New Orleans,'' said
the Duke-a-Paducah, Vernon C. Dugas, Mitchell's manager and a disc
jockey on a local public radio station.
   Mitchell, performing with his band The Toppers, had more than a
dozen hits on the Billboard Top 100 from 1952-62.
   His first record was ``I'm Crying,'' and his recording of ``Try
Rock and Roll'' was one of the first nationally released songs to
use the expression rock 'n' roll.
   ``He was one of the pioneers of rhythm and blues, and he should
be remembered as that,'' said Robert Vernon, a local music producer.
   Mitchell was probably best known for his hit, ``I'm Going to Be a
Wheel Someday,'' which was later covered by Fats Domino, another New
Orleans rhythm and blues man.
   Mitchell had been on a kidney dialysis machine for 10 years and
died at JoEllen Smith Hospital.
   A re-release of his early hits in 1979 brought him back into
performing. His last live show was at the New Orleans Jazz Fest last
year when friends carried him on to the stage.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Takeshita's Popularity Dives To 15 Per Cent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll released Saturday indicated support of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita has plunged to 15 percent with his
government embroiled in a stock trading scandal and planned sales
tax.
   The poll was published by a leading newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun,
which said in an editorial: ``Taking account of Takeshita's support
rate, no one would be surprised if his Cabinet should resign at any
time.''
   It said 3,000 adults throughout the nation were polled March 15
and 16 and support of Takeshita's government dropped to 15 percent
from 28 percent in January. The newspaper did not list a margin of
error in the poll.
   The editorial said it is ``indispensable to reconstruct politics
from the beginning'' by dissolving Parliament and holding general
elections.
   Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party government passed an
unpopular 3 percent consumption tax that will go into effect April 1
and proscutors have arrested 12 people in the stock profiteering
scandal.
   The scandal centers around an information conglomerate, Recruit
Co., which offered hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in its
real estate subsidiary to more than 150 people, including political
and business leaders.
   Takeshita's former finance minister was among three government
officials who resigned in the scandal.
   The Asahi Shimbun poll gave Takeshita the third lowest rating in
Japan's post-World War II history. Public support was polled at only
12 percent for prime ministers Nobusuke Kishi in 1960 and Kakuei
Tanaka in 1974. Kishi had pushed through Parliament a revision of
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and Tanaka was connected to a bribery
case involving the U.S.-based Lockheed Corp.
   The opposition on Friday demanded again that Takeshita and his
Cabinet resign and even the prime minister's advisory panel urged
him to apologize to the public.
   Takashi Ishihara, a member of the Wisemen's Club on Political
Reform that Takeshita formed in January, said, ``It is important for
him (the prime minister) to apologize and make his responsibility
clear'' in the Recruit case.
   ``The very idea of a politician making money through stock
transaction is wrong,'' said Ishihara, chairman of Nissan Motor Co.
   The panel also urged Takeshita to accept opposition demands to
summon his predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, to Parliament to testify
about his role in the affair.
   Takeshita said Friday, ``Since this problem surfaced during my
term in office I cannot turn my back on it. We must work to restore
the public trust by initiating political reforms.''
   Opposition parties have stalled parliamentary debate on the
country's budget since Wednesday when the LDP rejected their demands
that Takeshita resign or summon Nakasone to Parliament for
questioning.

<TEXT>
   State Treasurer A. James Manchin
testified at his impeachment hearing Friday that he received
documents showing massive losses in the state's consolidated
investment fund but didn't pay attention to them.
   Stating repeatedly ``I'm not a financial expert,'' the two-term
Democrat said he did not understand investment reports that crossed
his desk and had no idea the fund lost $279 million until late
November or early December 1988.
   The House Judiciary Committee, which has heard more than 50 hours
of testimony in the past two weeks, is to vote next week on whether
the House of Delegates should impeach Manchin.
   If the House does so, the treasurer would be tried by the state
Senate.
   Manchin, the last witness scheduled to appear before the
committee, said he depended on his staff to handle the investment
division in his office and that then-Associate Treasurer Arnold
Margolin and then-investment director Kathy Lester kept the losses
from him.
   ``The system failed,'' Manchin said. ``The checks didn't check.
The balances didn't balance.''
   Since the losses became public, Manchin said, he has been keeping
a close eye on the investment division. But when Delegate Rod Berry
asked Manchin how much the investment division made or lost last
week, Manchin would not answer.
   ``We can get you a report on that,'' the treasurer said.
   The losses occurred when the bond market took a nosedive in April
1987, and the treasurer's office traded extensively to keep the
losses at a minimum, other witnesses have testified. Instead, the
losses continued to mount.
   Manchin also was questioned Friday about a report he said was
sent to his office that showed the investment fund losing millions
of dollars in June 1987. Manchin expressed some confusion about the
meaning of the document and why some figures were shown in
parentheses _ a common method of showing losses on financial
documents.
   Manchin said he paid no attention to the report when he received
it, even though 87 of 90 figures on it indicated losses.
   ``All these reports look alike,'' Manchin said. ``I am not a
financial expert. I hired the best management team available.''

   Nineteen mushers continued pressing toward Nome after Adkins
arrived. Richard Self of Sterling, Diana Dronenburg of Willow; Jerry
Austin of St. Michael, Mitch Brazin of St. Michael; and Jamie Nelson
of Togo, Minn., were within 22 miles of Nome. The last musher,
Carolyn Muegge-Vaughan of Trapper Creek, was at Unalakleet, 267

have assured voters they won't be attacked if they go to the polls.
   However, some election workers in the capital and eastern areas
resigned Friday, saying they had been threatened. Two mayors also
quit after similar warnings.
   Despite the resignations, soldiers were ready to distribute
presidential ballots today to 236 of the nation's 260

   President Bush says the national debate over
rapid-fire assault weapons has ``gotten pretty hot'' and any
decision about new restrictions will be made in ``a cool way based
on facts.''
   Bush hinted Friday he may be willing to take some steps beyond
the newly announced federal ban on imports of five popular types of
semiautomatic weapons. Law enforcement officials are pressing for a
prohibition covering weapons made in America as well.
   ``The police have been very concerned about this and we've got to
find an accommodation between the police and the sporting interest.
In my view there can be an accommodation, there must be an
accommodation,'' said Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association and outspoken foe of gun control.

week under an intensified inspection plan designed to assure the
safety of the produce after traces of cyanide were found in two
grapes last week.
   The Bush administration cleared the way Friday for new shipments
of Chilean fruit with announcement of an inspection plan that
officials said will provide ``maximum feasible safety'' of the fruit
and end a weeklong health scare.
   Under the plan, fruit held by importers, wholesalers and

<HEAD>Foreign Language: A Complicated and Controversial Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of all the nomination processes that lead to
Academy Awards, none is more complicated _ or controversial _ than
the foreign language film award.
   It's commonly called the ``foreign film'' award. Not so. Nominees
must be in a language other than English, hence films from England,
Australia and Canada (except for Canadian films in French such as
the recent ``The Decline of the American Empire'') are not eligible
in this category.
   The controversial part of the foreign language award stems from
the fact that the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences and its voters have no control over the nominations. The
countries themselves can nominate one film per year. The system has
been criticized for its inequities.
   Critics claim that governments, especially military or communist
dictatorships, sometimes refuse to nominate films showing those
countries in a bad light. Politics in the selection committee can
also eliminate likely choices.
   Three years ago Akira Kurosawa's widely acclaimed ``Ran'' was not
submitted because of wrangling among Japanese committee members. The
directors branch of the Academy rallied to the great filmmaker and
nominated him for best director.
   This year's nominations for the foreign language Oscar managed to
dodge controversy. Two of the entries stand out: Spain's ``Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' which has attracted rave
reviews; and Denmark's ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' winner of the Cannes
Film Festival prize for best picture.
   ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' written and
directed by Pedro Almodovar, concerns two Madrid women whose
personal and professional lives are in chaos. The comedy has been a
big success in the United States ($4.4 million in 17 weeks of
limited release), and critics have compared it to the screwball
comedies of Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey and George Stevens.
   The star, Carmen Maura, is not surprised by the American
response. Her friendship with Almodovar goes back to when he worked
for the Madrid telephone company and she was a television talk-show
hostess.
   ``When I began to work with Pedro 10 years ago and we had a very
special situation together,'' she said during a visit here, ``I said
to him: `Hey, Pedro, don't worry, because in one time the Americans
will understand you.'
   ``I am very proud of Pedro Almodovar. I think he's very genuine.
His sense of humor is very American sometimes, and mine also. So I
understand why you Americans like `Women on the Verge.'''
   Max Von Sydow, who stars in ``Pelle the Conqueror'' along with
young Pelle Hvenegaard as his son, also has high praise for his
director, Danish Bille August.
   ``He's very, very sensitive and has a great hand with people,
especially children. Very soft-spoken, he seems almost shy. But he's
a brilliant man, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what he'll
do in the future.''
   ``Pelle'' ($1.1 million during 11 weeks of limited domestic
release) concerns a Swedish peasant who brings his son to a Danish
farm, where the father endures a series of indignities as a lowly
worker. The film was shot on the bleak landscape during one of the
coldest winters in decades.
   ``It looks more rugged than it really was,'' Von Sydow said. ``We
had to spend a few cold days and nights out in the open, but thank
God, we had warmth nearby.''
   ``Hanussen,'' the entry from Hungary, is the third of three
impressive films by Istvan Szabo on themes of human folly and free
will. The first, ``Mephisto,'' won the Oscar for foreign language
film of 1981. The second was nominated in 1985. All three star Klaus
Maria Brandauer, known to American audiences as Meryl Streep's
husband in ``Out of Africa.''
   Brandauer plays Erik Jan Hanussen, whose apparent genius for
telepathy makes him a theatrical star in Germany. His fame leads him
into the inner circles of Nazi power, with unexpected results.
   ``Salaam Bombay,'' directed by Mira Nair, is the nominee from
India, earning $1.8 million during 22 weeks of limited U.S. release.
Filmed with grim realism, the story concerns a young boy who is
abandoned by his family to the streets of Bombay, where he consorts
with thieves, drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps.
   The Belgian entry is ``The Music Teacher,'' directed by Gerard
Corbiau. The story concerns a vocal coach imposes his strict
discipline on two singers, entering them into a competition
sponsored by a wealthy patron who hates him.

   If the Academy Award race for supporting actor
goes according to form, the winner would be Alec Guinness for
``Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say.
   After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work:
Don Ameche, ``Cocoon,'' 1985; Michael Caine, ``Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' 1986; Sean Connery, ``The Untouchables,'' 1987.
   The trouble is that Academy Award voters don't always follow
tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the
six hours of ``Little Dorrit.''
   The British-made film is based on Charles Dickens' last, often
overlooked novel. Guinness, Oscar winner as best actor for ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as William Dorrit,
longtime resident of debtors' prison.
   ``The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the
74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, ``because in many ways
it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to
kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him
because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into
prison for 20-odd years for debt.''
   But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's
Martin Landau, nominated for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' For
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such
as ``North by Northwest, ``Cleopatra'' and ``Nevada Smith,'' though
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.''
   Francis Coppola gave Landau the role of his life as Abe Karatz,
financial adviser to car builder Preston Tucker. Of Coppola, Landau,
54, remarks: ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you,
that's a vote of confidence. Francis really creates a background for
you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Landau is a director of the Actors Studio in Hollywood, and he
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News, he drew portraits of Abe
and analyzed him as ``a lonely New York businessman who really has
no family, no friends and no life outside work.''
   Then there's Dean Stockwell, nominated as the outrageous Mafia
don in ``Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52
years. The son of singer Harry Stockwell, Dean was a child actor in
such films as ``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``The Boy With the Green Hair.''
   His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after
his child-star days; success as a young man in ``Compulsion,''
``Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during
the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act,
but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, Joy,
moved to Santa Fe, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him.
   Stockwell credits director Jonathan Demme for taking a chance on
him in ``Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: ``No one had ever
thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid
of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and
neurotics and sensitive people.''
   Kevin Kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious
underworld type in ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Known for his flamboyant
roles in the theater, Kline, 41, has created a series of indelible
performances on the screen: as Meryl Streep's erratic lover in
``Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in ``The Big Chill'';
the swashbuckling buccaneer in ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   The actor believes that his screen potential hasn't been reached:
``I've done tons of roles on the stage that I haven't even
approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd
like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures,
comedies. No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that
way.''
   The youngest nominee is 18-year-old River Phoenix, named for his
``Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the
run from the FBI. Phoenix has established himself as one of the
screen's best young actors in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Mosquito Coast'' and ``Little Nikita.''
   As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the
move, Phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in
``Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing
was good training for acting.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''

<HEAD>Caterpillar, Steel Industry At Odds Over Quotas</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bill Feuchter lovingly taps the bright yellow
bulldozer awaiting finishing touches on the Caterpillar Inc.
production line. ``You can hardly point to a part on there that
isn't steel,'' he says.
   Steel is the backbone of Caterpillar's business, and nobody knows
it more intimately than Feuchter, who buys 500,000 tons a year of
the metal that winds up in the formidable earth-moving machines
under the CAT name.
   As it searches for the cheapest materials available, Caterpillar
finds itself at odds with its major supplier, the U.S. steel
industry, over quotas that limit imports of foreign steel.
   Twenty percent of the half-million tons of the steel Caterpillar
uses annually comes from Europe, Canada and other countries
overseas. The company joined, by a coalition of about 250 mostly
small manufacturers, is fighting efforts to extend the quotas.
   It is a fight not just about trade but about politics.
   President Bush made a campaign promise to renew the so-called
Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) when they expire Sept. 30, and
54 senators are co-sponsoring legislation to extend for five years
the VRAs, which limit the European Community and 19 other countries
to a 20 percent share of the U.S. market. Despite complaints from
the steel industry, the United States refused to subject Canada to
the VRAs in 1984.
   Bush, however, is an ardent champion of free trade and a foe of
what he calls the ``fool's gold'' of protectionism.
   Indeed, in the same letter to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., pledging to
support continuation of the VRAs, Bush also vowed to press for an
international consensus on fair trade that would eliminate the need
for the U.S. barrier.
   Even now, top-level Bush trade and economic officials are
debating internally just how long the extended VRAs should last and
what types of steel they should cover. U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills has echoed Bush's sentiments that the VRAs are a stopgap
and the real goal is to end the subsidies, dumping and closed
markets that distort the price of steel.
   It is the first major test of trade policy for the Bush
administration. If the United States insists on some protective
barrier to shelter its steel industry, how much force will it carry
when it insists on dismantling the barriers that protect farmers in
Europe or Japan?
   Political realities at home may force Bush, like Ronald Reagan
before him, to temper disdain for protectionism against the pressing
need to rein in the $137 billion trade deficit and bolster a vital
U.S. industry that saw 290,000 jobs disappear in the past decade.
   The U.S. steel industry is operating today at 89 percent of
capacity, rolling up profits of $3 billion in the past two years
after being staggered by losses of $12 billion in the previous five.
   Caterpillar and its allies charge the VRAs will force U.S.
companies to pay artificially high prices for the next five years,
impairing their ability to sell goods here and abroad.
   The VRAs ``cost us dearly,'' said Patrick A. Thompson, president
of Trans-Matic Inc. of Holland, Mich., and chairman of the Precision
Metalforming Association. ``If we are ever going to get the trade
deficit down, people in manufacturing are going to have to start
shipping product out of this country. But before we can do that,
we've got to have the material.''
   But the steel industry counters vehemently that what is at stake
is the survival of the American mills, still struggling to regroup
and modernize after the calamitous downturn in the first half of the
1980s.
   ``The VRAs are in the long-run interests of (American) consumers
as well as producers,'' said Alan W. Wolff, a former deputy U.S.
trade representative leading the industry fight.
   ``Obviously in the United States everyone wants to buy everything
at the lowest possible price now,'' said Wolff. But no other
industrialized country ``has considered it acceptable to lose its
self-sufficiency in steel.''
   Thomas C. Graham, president of the USS Division of USX Corp., the
biggest U.S. steel maker, put it more bluntly at a recent Washington
debate on VRAs.
   ``If we keep putzing around with this VRA question ... more of
the industry (will) liquidate, and there will be all this
handwringing about allocation,'' Graham said.
   Caterpillar and its coalition notwithstanding, Graham claimed
that ``95 percent of our customers are with us'' in support of the
import quotas.
   ``They've seen a third of the domestic steel industry liquidate
(and) they know that process can continue. It's in their enlightened
self-interest,'' said Graham, the chairman of the American Iron &amp;
Steel Institute.

   A few years ago, Peoria-based Caterpillar, like the U.S. steel
industry, was on the industrial critical list. The company lost $953
million in 1982-84 and saw Japan's Komatsu pose a stiff challenge to
its world leadership in the heavy construction field.
   Big Cat battled back by restructuring factory floors, forging a
new relationship with workers, and looking for every possible way to
lower costs and stay competitive in the world marketplace. Last year
it posted profits of $616 million on record sales of $10.4 billion,
half of them abroad.
   The weaker dollar helped revive Caterpillar's fortunes, but
company officials say the recovery was also sped by radically
altering their production methods to emphasize quality and minimize
costs. Stacks of empty parts bins outside one of the Caterpillar
plants straddling the Illinois River testify to the company's
success in eliminating the need for huge stockpiles of parts.
   Feuchter, manager of central purchasing for Caterpillar's steel
division, said, ``Our chief needs are high quality materials on time
and at the right price. VRAs don't help any of that. They inhibit
our ability to shop the best way we know how.''
   While steel prices fell during the first two years under VRAs,
Timothy L. Elder, Caterpillar's manager of governmental affairs,
said, ``They were overpriced to begin with.''
   He cited a study done for the anti-VRA coalition by the Stern
Group, a trade advisory group headed by former International Trade
Commissioner Paula Stern, that concluded U.S. manufacturers paid an
average of $5 billion, or 25 percent, more for steel each year from
1969 through 1985 than their counterparts in Japan and West Germany.
   Strong worldwide demand has pushed steel prices up since 1986.
Caterpillar blames the quotas for helping push up its prices for
plate steel 17 percent a year ago, and for inducing shortages of
large tractor track shoes that are only made overseas.
   The Commerce Department allowed Caterpillar last summer to import
an extra 13,000 tons of the steel track shoes because of the short
supply.

   ``I don't have any sympathy for the mills,'' said steel buyer
Feuchter. ``I understand what they're going through. It's the same
thing Caterpillar went through, and we didn't have protection. We
had to bite the bullet. That's what modernization is all about.''

   At LTV Steel's Indiana Harbor Works in East Chicago, Ind., one of
the mammoth mills that line the lakeshore between Chicago and Gary,
Ind., general manager Richard A. Veitch finds it inconceivable that
anyone could accuse the steel industry of not modernizing.
   ``We're high tech. We're a far more sophisticated industry than
people realize,'' said Veitch.
   LTV, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, invested more
than $325 million to modernize its operations last year. A sizable
chunk went to Indiana Harbor, which recently opened a $76 million
ladle metallurgy facility to produce high quality, ultra-low carbon
steel.
   In 1987 LTV spent $130 million rebuilding a huge blast furnace at
Indiana Harbor and relined a second major furnace last year at a
cost of $70 million.
   Five years ago, said Veitch, ``blast furnaces didn't have
computers and all these CRT screens with all this stuff flashing on
them. But today one guy sits in a room and knows what's going on in
the whole furnace.''
   Behind other weathered, hulking steel facades, small crews sit in
computer-lined ``pulpits'' running fiery steel-making operations
that once required twice as many workers.
   The Indiana Harbor Works has a continuous casting facility that
set a world production record in 1987. Instead of pouring the molten
steel into ingots, the caster allows steel to be molded into slabs
and sent hurtling down the line like a glowing tobaggan, stretched
to thousandths of an inch by rollers and cooled with torrents of
water. The steel emerges in hot, rolled coils produced in a fraction
of the time and cost of old methods.
   Indiana Harbor is LTV's front-line plant that gets the first
orders and the first improvements. A sister plant in Cleveland still
makes half its steel in ingots and lacks a ladle metallurgy facility.
   ``We have just begun to scratch the surface of trying to climb
back up and become economically viable,'' said Veitch. As an
industry, ``we've got to get to 100 percent continuous cast''
instead of the current 65 percent.
   ``Just from this plant's perspective, I've got a lot more that
needs to be done to be truly, consistently world competitive,'' said
Veitch, who speaks enviously of advances the Japanese and Europeans
have made on hot-strip rolling mills.
   Veitch is nonplused by the complaints from Caterpillar.
   ``If you look at the whole world market situation, we're not out
of line in terms of prices,'' the plant manager said. ``We're just
approaching levels price-wise that we were at in 1982.''
   In Chicago, at the top of the Inland Steel building, Inland
Director of Corporate Communications Sam H. Saran grumbled, ``What
do they want us to do? Give our steel away like we did for four
years?''
   The U.S. mills boast they are now producing a ton of steel at a
lower average cost than any country in the world. Costs are down 35
percent since 1982, productivity is up 40 percent, and quality is
greatly improved, they say.
   The steelmakers say they reinvested $9 billion in modernizing
plants and equipment between 1982-87, a third more than their cash
flow from steel. The VRA legislation requires such reinvestment.
   Graham, the president of the USX steel division, said, ``When you
see (Chrysler's) Lee Iacocca on television announcing a new
seven-year (car) guarantee, you want to recall that that's made
possible by technological innovation in the domestic steel
industry.''
   ``Nowhere in the world is steel sold at prices as low as it is
currently in the U.S.,'' Graham said at a recent VRA debate
sponsored by the Economic Policy Institute.
   ``American auto makers are paying about $100 per ton less for
their domestic steel than Toyota is paying in Japan,'' said Heinz,
the Pennsylvania senator.

   The rise of the yen and mark have narrowed the once formidable
wage gap between U.S. steel workers and their foreign counterparts.
U.S. steel workers' wages have risen only 2.5 percent since 1982 to
$14.78 per hour, according to the WEFA group _ a fact that the
United Steelworkers Union will emphasize in negotiations to renew
labor contracts that expire this July 31 at four of the big six U.S.
steelmakers. Fringes add almost $10 an hour to the steel workers'
compensation.
   Steel imports, which claimed 26 percent of the U.S. market in
1984, dropped to 21 percent in 1988, just above the VRA target
level. Some countries did not ship their full quotas to the United
States, presumably because they could fetch higher prices elsewhere.
While 20 million tons were imported last year, U.S. steel makers
exported 2 million tons.
   In the event that the VRAs are not extended, steel companies are
keeping trade law specialists like Alan Wolff busy preparing
hundreds of unfair trade cases to bring before the International
Trade Commission against foreign producers.
   It was in part the difficulty of trying to resolve a myriad of
such disputes through the ITC that prompted the Reagan
administration to embrace VRAs in 1984.
   Gary Hufbauer, a Georgetown University professor of international
finance who favors a phaseout of the VRAs, said the steelmakers want
``insurance against a cyclical downturn or an overvalued dollar in
the 1990s.''
   But Wolff countered that, ``The international conditions that
gave rise to the VRAs have not changed significantly.''
   ``Steel and the State,'' a 580-page book co-authored by Wolff,
charges the steel industry in Europe was kept alive only by
``repeated, massive injuections of state aid,'' including $35
billion between 1980 and 1985 alone. Currently, Italy's state-owned
Finsider Group is getting almost $6 billion in new subsidies, said
Wolff.
   ``Getting plant and equipment at zero cost is an unbeatable
competitive advantage,'' he said.
   USX's Graham has a ready answer when asked why the renascent
steel industry is putting so much vigor into the fight for VRAs.
   ``We're at the top of the cycle. This is a cyclical business. And
we know it will turn down someday. That's when VRAs are important.
They are a soft-market mechanism,'' Graham said. ``But they're a
political device so you've got to get them in place.''
   Heinz isn't ready to declare victory.
   ``It isn't over 'til it's over,'' said the co-chairman of the
Senate Steel Caucus. ``Trade disputes are always very chancy.''
   Several major newspapers have railed against extension of the
VRAs, saying it's time for big steel to stand on its own.
   Inland's Saran replies, ``We're getting the same kind of
misguided editorials from all the newspapers, all of whom are free
traders, except when it comes to their own business.''
   ``If there was some way tomorrow for the Japanese to set up a
competitive newspaper in Chicago and give the Tribune a run for
their money, and they were subsidized by the (Japanese) government,
guess who's side they'd be on?'' asked Saran. ``They'd probably be
on the side of having the laws observed.''

   Bargain prices for coveted airport gates and
computer reservation systems. Millions in loans from a debt-swamped
airline to its growing sister. Money-losing deals to buy fuel from
the parent.
   In court papers, Eastern Airlines' recalcitrant pilots make a
strong case that Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo has plotted
to suck Eastern's blood to buoy non-union Continental Airlines, a
key issue as the saga of the strike-decimated carrier moves through
bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``Either a sophisticated asset stripping scheme is under way or
management is incompetent,'' the pilots state in documents filed in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court last week.
   The pilots cite alleged bargain sales, no-gain loans and
money-losing arrangements they say have undermined parent Texas
Air's claim that its affiliated airlines are separate entities. They
say Lorenzo's management clearly benefited Continental and Texas Air
at Eastern's detriment.
   Eastern, which was losing money long before Lorenzo arrived in
1986, says it transacted above-board, fair-market deals among
subsidiaries, with no illicit intermingling of Eastern and
Continental blood.
   Nonetheless, a 59-page court brief filed last week by the Air
Line Pilots Association provides illuminating details that at least
raise major questions about Eastern management's behavior.
   The brief culls information from Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, federal court testimony, a Transportation
Department report and company financial records to make the case
that Eastern and Continental are deeply interwoven.
   The most striking deal _ ``the red flag on the bull in the
bullring'' in the words of one aviation analyst _ was the 1987
transfer of Eastern's coveted computerized reservation system to
Continental for $100 million.
   At the time, the system was worth at least triple that amount.
Moreover, debt-swamped Eastern didn't get a $100 million cash
infusion from the deal, which it badly needed to support day-to-day
operations. Instead it got $100 million in notes bearing 6 percent
interest _ payable in full in the year 2012.
   Analysts have questioned the financial wisdom of transferring the
computerized reservation system to its new sister. Similar networks
soon after fetched $280 million, $500 million and $650 million.
   Eastern maintains it couldn't afford to upgrade its network in a
highly competitive battle for travel agents, who book tickets
through airline-run computers. Eastern says it was paying $130
million a year to operate the network, money it now pays to Texas
Air for a better product.
   The question of whether Eastern and Continental have been kept
separate is central to the bankruptcy proceedings.
   A judge ultimately could decide whether Lorenzo allowed Eastern
to languish and refused to merge the two subsidiaries in an attempt
to destroy Eastern's unions. Texas Air wants to avoid placing its
assets on the line to cover Eastern's more than $3 billion in
liabilities.
   ``By keeping the companies separate, Lorenzo doesn't get the two
groups together to be unionized,'' said a New York aviation lawyer
who asked not to be identified. ``If he put the two together he
would face a situation where if he allowed enough parity of
employees that would force an election.
   ``Then Lorenzo has a completely unionized property, which is what
he got out of five years ago.''
   The pilots' court brief also alleges the following action damaged
Eastern:
   _Eastern loaned $40 million to Continental last spring at the
same time it was seeking an Internal Revenue Service waiver on a
$105 million contribution to its pension fund. Eastern says the loan
was repaid.
   _For almost two years Eastern failed to demand a non-interest
bearing $16 million payment due for merger-related expenses from
Texas Air. The inaction cost the airline about $2.8 million a year
in lost interest earnings. Eastern called it a ``bookkeeping
transaction'' that has since been paid.
   _In March 1987, Eastern paid Texas Air $25 million for a note
worth $30 million owned by nearly bankrupt People Express, which
Texas Air had previously acquired. Texas Air made $4.4 million on
the deal. The pilots called it a senseless investment since People
Express had no creditworthiness and Eastern needed to conserve cash.
   _Eastern paid $22 million to Continental for strike-related
services in December 1987 and another $19 million last fall for
similar services that have not been used. Eastern maintains the
money was well-spent.
   _Continental, the pilots claim, disproportionate gained from a
merger of sales offices with Eastern in January 1987. Eastern
brought in 166 offices while Continental contributed 27. The
arrangement was dissolved last December.
   _Continental paid $11 million to Eastern for 11 Newark
International Airport gates allegedly worth twice as much. The court
papers compare the deal with Eastern's 1986 sale of eight Charlotte,
N.C., gates to Piedmont Airlines for $25 million. Eastern says it
got the market price.
   _A fuel purchase agreement with Texas Air costs Eastern about $18
million annually but provides no apparent savings, the papers state.
Eastern claims it saves $6 million a year. Texas Air claims the
arrangement merges purchases of Eastern and Continental, giving them
greater clout with suppliers.
   _The pending sale of the Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump for
$365 million will reduce Eastern's cash flow by $30 million to $40
million, the pilots say. The airline says sale of the shuttle,
despite its profitability, is necessary for the airline's survival.
   The pilots claim downsizing Eastern last year by closing its
Kansas City. Mo., hub and selling planes, routes and airport gates
as part of $130 million in asset sales has hurt profitability while
benefiting Continental. They also say most of Eastern's directors
and managers used to work at Texas Air, Continental or both _ and
don't have Eastern's best interests in mind.
   Another key issue involves Eastern's pension obligations _ put at
$320 million by the company but $750 million by the federal Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation. Under federal law, Texas Air and
Continental could be held liable for the total underfunding of
Eastern's pension plans.
   If Eastern fails to make a $100 million payment due in September,
lawyers said, the government could tap money from elsewhere in the
Texas Air structure. To guarantee payment, Eastern may sell more
assets.
   The pilots' court papers ask Judge Burton R. Lifland to appoint a
trustee to run Eastern during bankruptcy proceedings, charging that
Lorenzo would continue dismantling Eastern and try to break its
unions, as he did after taking Continental into bankruptcy in 1983.
   ``It may not win over the long run but it certainly puts a lot of
flies in the ointment in terms of trying to get the assets sold
piecemeal,'' said Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   But lawyers said obtaining a trustee is difficult and may be
viewed by Lifland as unnecessary. Moreover, the judge may not view
Eastern management's sale of assets and other actions as
irresponsible.
   ``These asset sales have kept Eastern in business,'' Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said. ``Without these sales, this company
would have gone belly-up a long time ago.''

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A benign winter for stock market investors is
approaching its end with some increasingly chilling worries about
inflation.
   In their strongest sustained performance since the great bull
market of 1982-87, stock prices began to rally late in November,
gathered strength in January and established new post-crash highs in
early February.
   After a modest pullback, they came on strong again and nearly
equaled their February highs this past week.
   But the upbeat mood in the financial world suddenly took an
anxious turn on Friday, when the Labor Department reported that the
producer price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point
in February for the second straight month.
   Two months' figures don't make a trend. But anyone who projected
the figures out over a full year was bound to stir memories of the
dread phenomenon of a decade ago, double-digit inflation.
   Few economists on Wall Street had considered that as even a
remote possibility. Even after the data were in, forecasters believe
there is very little chance of an economic replay of the soaring
prices seen in the late 1970s.
   But the widely held belief that the Federal Reserve would succeed
in its effort to keep inflation in check without much economic pain
has suffered a serious challenge.
   And some nagging questions took on a new urgency: In a
deregulated economy that operates on huge international flows of
money, how much power does the Fed have to achieve its
anti-inflationary goals?
   Assuming that the mission can be accomplished, what degree of
credit-tightening will be needed, and how high will that drive
interest rates?
   Lastly, will the central bank have to squeeze the economy to the
point of recession before it sees any evidence that it is getting
inflation under control?
   As traders faced those issues, stocks fell sharply on Friday,
giving up nearly all of a strong gain they had amassed earlier in
the week, when it looked as though the strains on the economy might
be easing.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 48.57 on Friday,
finished the week with a net gain of 10.00 at 2,292.14.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped .19 to
164.66; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 3.71 to 402.19, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 4.16 at 328.36.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 177.28 million shares a day, up
from 159.80 million the week before.
   ``The core inflation rate (excluding food and energy), which is
now almost 5 percent, has been inching up consistently since
mid-1988,'' observed Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``Any further increases, either in food commodity prices or crude
oil prices, would only worsen inflationary fears. The fact that
inventories have been consistently low will only result in further
inflationary pressure as reordering may prove to be costly for most
businesses.
   ``It may no longer be an easy task to slow down the economy or
reduce inflationary pressures.''
   Hopes still persist in many minds on Wall Street, however, that
the Fed's efforts will soon start to yield some tangible results.
   Inflation scares have hit the markets numerous times in recent
years, they point out, and all to date have proved unwarranted.
   Said Michael Sherman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
``we believe the time is fast approaching when interest rates start
to slow the economy.''

   The government's latest news on inflation has
sent investors scurrying for cover like targets of a semiautomatic
assault-rifle attack and left stunned economists wondering how high
interest rates will go.
   ``I think of it as the St. Patty's Day massacre,'' said Robert
Brusca, a senior vice president at Nikko Securities International
Inc., after the Labor Department said wholesale prices surged 1.0
percent in February. ``If this shocks you into thinking we have an
inflation problem, that's right.''
   The report this past Friday matched a jump in January and
translated into an annual wholesale inflation rate exceeding 12
percent, more than triple the level of last year.
   It incited one of the biggest setbacks of the year for the stock
and bond markets, where prices tumbled on fear that inflation is
eroding the value of these investments and will require a stiff
curative dose of higher interest rates orchestrated by the Federal
Reserve, the nation's central bank.
   The prospect of sharply tighter credit, in turn, signaled a range
of potential consequences that included higher mortgage rates, more
loan defaults and rising unemployment _ possible elements of a
recession.
   ``If you hold debt that's based on an adjustrable rate, it will
raise your monthly expenses,'' said Michael Moran, a strategist at
Daiwa Securities America in New York. ``As for big ticket items like
housing, the higher cost of credit will slow demand for these
things.''
   On a broader scale, the higher cost of borrowing could derail the
Bush administration's plan for reducing the national debt and budget
deficit, which is largely based on economic growth and no tax
increases.
   Rising rates also could intensify problems faced by hundreds of
sickly thrifts by driving up their own business expenses and the
cost of a federal bailout program already estimated at more than
$100 billion.
   The wholesale inflation number deeply disturbed economists not
only because it exceeded expectations but affected every major area,
from clothing to food to energy expenses.
   ``The sense here is that the acceleration in inflation has been
steady, and the forces keeping inflation going are still in place,''
Brusca said. ``Everything that's going on here is negative.''
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Inflation fears were further aggravated by rising oil prices,
which surged to the highest level in nearly two years. As of Friday,
April contracts for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude cost
$20.33 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   _Despite the inflation news, other government figures indicated
the economy is slowing down. For February, industrial output
remained largely unchanged; factory use fell to 84.3 percent from
84.5 percent a month earlier; housing starts fell 11.4 percent;
retail sales fell 0.4 percent; imports and exports declined in
January.
   _New twists complicated a bitter strike at Eastern Airlines, with
no sign of resolution. In bankruptcy proceedings, pilots and
machinists accused management of deliberate negligence and sought a
court-appointed trustee to run the airline. Management won an
emergency court order directing other carriers to honor pre-strike
business agreements. Union officials talked of a possible
employee-led buyout.
   _RJR Nabisco Inc., target of the biggest successful takeover in
history, got a new chief, Louis Gerstner, a former American Express
Co. executive. On a smaller scale, a partnership including actor Tim
Matheson, who portrayed a sophomoric philanderer in ``Animal
House,'' acquired control of the company that produced the hit film,
National Lampoon Inc.

<HEAD>Bondholders Rights May Be Emerging Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``BondReview,'' one word, is cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's been much talk in the last few years of
shareholder rights. Now the financial markets may be seeing the
emergence of a new movement: bondholder rights.
   The recent experience of GAF Corp. when it redeemed several bond
issues as part of its plan to go private shows that some bondholders
no longer will sit by passively while a corporation restructures.
   When GAF announced it would redeem the bond issues before
maturity as part of its $1.46 billion, management-led buyout, major
institutional holders of the securities banded together, hired an
adviser and went to battle with the Wayne, N.J., chemical and
building-products company until it raised the bond-redemption prices
several times.
   ``The bondholders were able to receive a reasonable premium and
not have to suffer any losses,'' said Jack Ackerman, president of
BondReview Inc., the adviser to the GAF bondholder group.
   In order to undertake the buyout, GAF needed the approval of the
holders of three issues of its high-yield, or ``junk,'' bonds.
Covenants written into the bond issues required the approval of the
bondholders before the company could restructure, Ackerman said.
Such covenants typically restrict a company from incurring
additional debt without bondholder approval.
   GAF offered to pay the bondholders a fee for their consent to
disregard the covenants, and at the same time buy back their bonds.
   But some institutional holders of the bonds, primarily insurance
companies, believed the bonds were worth more than GAF was offering,
Ackerman said. With his help, they formed a group and decided not to
tender their bonds right away.
   GAF responded by raising its tender offer, but not by much,
Ackerman said.
   ``They were testing to find out if a group had been formed,'' he
said. ``Nobody tendered.''
   The bondholder group then negotiated with GAF, and reached
agreement on the price GAF offered for the bonds and for the consent
fee, or the amount it paid for bondholders to relinquish their right
to reject GAF's restructuring.
   ``By forming these groups and staying together and by a
reasonable negotiation position with the company, bondholders
increased their payment by about $20 million'' overall for the three
bond issues involved, Ackerman said.
   He said the sweetened offers represented improvements ranging
from 5 percent to 8 percent for each of the bond issues compared
with the first GAF offers.
   GAF refused to comment on the bond redemption. An unidentified
GAF official told Bondweek, a weekly trade newsletter, that the
final GAF offer for one of the bond issues ``wound up being more
expensive than we planned.''
   Ackerman said one important reason for bondholders to negotiate
as a group is that if the company receives approval from holders of
51 percent of its bonds, it can undertake the changes barred by the
bond covenants.
   For example, he said, if holders of 51 percent of the GAF bonds
agreed to give up their covenant rights, holders of the other 49
percent would face the prospect that their bonds would be worth less
as the company incurred more debt during a buyout.
   ``You've got a potential tyranny of the majority over the
minority,'' he said.
   Some bond market analysts believe more bondholders will become
more active in protecting their interests because of corporate
restructurings. In addition to enforcing covenants in existing
bonds, investors increasingly are demanding that new issues contain
covenants protecting them from managements that load up on debt.
   ``Institutional investors are looking at the way things are going
these days and are deciding not to take a passive attitude,'' said
David Blitzer, chief economist for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the
security-rating company.
   Several industry watchers pointed to the recent leveraged buyout
of RJR Nabisco Inc. as a turning point in bondholder awareness.
   ``A lot of big investors in R.J. Reynolds thought they had been
unfairly treated,'' Blitzer said. He said RJR had completed a debt
issue shortly before the leveraged buyout was announced. ``People
thought they were given the short end of the stick.''
   The rating of some RJR debt fell after the company's
debt-financed buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Two major RJR
bondholders, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and ITT Corp.'s
insurance subsidiary, sued the company for alleged damage to the
value of their investment.
   ``Clearly, bondholders are becoming more active in standing up
for their rights, and that has been especially true since the RJR
Nabisco LBO,'' said Lewis Knox, an executive editor of Bondweek.
   ``I don't mean to say that RJR treated its bondholders badly,''
he added. ``It was just that people though RJR was a safe bet
because it was so big.''

   As veteran Fire Department paramedics working some
of Chicago's meanest streets, Kevin Roche and Joe Guzzardo thought
they'd seen just about everything. Then they they took part-time
jobs staffing the medical office at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``The one I'll never forget,'' said Guzzardo, ``is the time a guy
came in here with part of a pencil sticking out of his chest. I
mean, it gets rough in the (trading) pits every so often, and we get
lots of guys stabbed with pencils.
   ``Hands are pretty common and every once in a while, a guy will
get stuck in the face. But this guy got it in the chest and the poor
guy was panicking so much, we pulled it out ourselves instead of
sending him over to the hospital.
   ``And as soon as we finished bandaging him up,'' Guzzardo said,
``he puts his jacket back on and went back to trade.''
   Roche nods, then adds, ``Thank God they're making pencils out of
graphite.
   ``Because if they were still using lead, we'd have lost a few
guys.''
   To be truthful, a typical day at the Board of Trade's medical
office, located just a few stops down the marble-paneled hallway
from the coat room of the sprawling futures market, is less like an
episode of the television series ``M.A.S.H'' than a commercial for
Maytag appliances.
   An average of 10 to 15 traders find their way into the office
each day, about half for what amounts to regularly scheduled
maintenance and the other half for ``cuts and bruises, flu, your
normal stuff,'' said Roche.
   ``We monitor about 200 guys on a regular basis...blood pressure,
headaches and dizziness, the occasional diabetic. The funny thing,''
he said, ``is that people probably guess with all the pressure and
high stakes around this place, we'd get lots of guys coming
in...hyperventilating and such.
   ``But I've been here since they opened the office and never once
has a guy come in here, sweating or bug-eyed or anything and said,
`Jeez, I just lost my shirt.'
   ``Most of the guys with a history of high blood pressure or heart
troubles are under the regular care of the doctor. We see them at
the beginning of the day or the end,'' he said. ``You can never get
a feel for what's going on in the pits by what happens in here.''
   The medical office was created in 1978 in case of health
emergencies at the fast-growing exchange, a leading U.S. center for
trading futures contracts in items that range from grains to
soybeans to Treasury bonds.
   Today if offers a range of services and equipment far beyond its
humble origins. In the beginning, Roche notes, pointing to a small
photo on the wall, the ``office'' was a cabinet with a single oxygen
tank inside.
   Today, it boasts emergency life-support and state-of-the-art
heart and respiratory monitoring systems and is staffed by six
Chicago Fire Department paramedics working on a revolving basis
during their 36 hours between shifts.
   Despite having worked at the Board of Trade for 10 years, Roche
said he does little other than keeping abreast of how some of the
commodities traded there might be doing _ strictly for the sake of
conversation _ and ``doesn't dabble.''
   ``No way,'' he said. ``You might hear somebody say something
about this or that or the other, but it's something I'd never get
into.
   ``Look,'' he added, ``I've got more than enough stress in my
regular job.''

<HEAD>Sears First: Outside Designer to Develop Three New Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail giant Sears, Roebuck and Co., in the midst
of an overhaul of its operation, has for the first time signed up an
outside designer to develop three new lines of house-brand women's
wear.
   The move is ``limited in scope,'' said Sears spokeswoman Kathy
Gucfa, but has ``tremendous potential.
   Sears occasionally had used outside consultants in the past, she
said, but never to the extent of having them handle the entire
project.
   ``It's an indication we're more open to some fresh outside
ideas,'' Ms. Gucfa said. ``We're looking at difference approaches to
our business.''
   Sears tends to be better known for its durable goods than for
fashions.
   The company's recent restructuring moves _ ranging from the
marketing of its landmark Sears Tower, the world's tallest building,
to everyday low prices systemwide _ include a move toward increased
use of outside name brands.
   But that move was not so strong in clothing departments, Ms.
Gucfa said.
   ``The whole store still has more private that national brands,
but in apparel even more so,'' she said.
   The new lines will be private-label merchandise from Associated
Merchandising Co. of New York, owned by a group of the nation's
largest department stores.
   Ms. Gucfa said the new sportswear lines from AMC are to include
Premises, fashionable separates at ``better prices''; Middlebrook
Park, offering more traditional styles; and a third line, not yet
named more, of larger apparel.
   While Premises is a little more upscale than the clothing
traditionally offered Sears' women customers, ``none of it is a
departure for us,'' she said. ``It's still Sears.''

   Oil prices zoomed past the $20 a barrel mark for
the first time in 19 months, capping a five-day rally on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark grade of crude oil, hit $20.33 a barrel on Friday, the
highest level since Aug. 14, 1987 when crude prices closed at
$20.57. The contract closed at $19.84 in the previous session.
   On Monday, crude prices crossed a resistance level of $19 after
fluctuating in the $18 range the previous two weeks. Since Friday
when the contract stood at $18.50, prices have risen $1.83, driven
by several reports pointing to a decline in available raw petroleum,
traders said.
   ``This week had one piece of bullish news after another in a
market that is technically strong,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice
president in charge of energy brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   The reports indicated: falling U.S. inventories; a tightening of
crude oil supplies in the Gulf of Mexico, a major U.S. oil-producing
region; problems in the North Sea that temporarily disrupted
production at a large Norwegian oil complex; and sharp cutbacks by
Saudi Arabia to Japan, Europe and the United States.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, unleaded
gasoline for April delivery declined 0.21 cent to 55.62 a gallon and
April heating oil fell 0.26 cent to close at 53.57 cents.
   Traders said April and May gasoline prices were under pressure
from Friday's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency
would not enforce new higher octane rules for some northeastern
states until after June 1 instead of May 15 as previously announced.
   Traders said the strong showing on the April crude oil contract
was due largely to short covering _ or buying to repay borrowed
positions _ in advance of the contract's expiration on Monday when
many players will be out of the market for a national petroleum
refiners conference.
   ``There was a definite reluctance to sell. People were buying,''
said Stephen Piasio, vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   May crude rose 24 cents and June advanced 13 cents, with smaller
gains for second-half contracts. Traders said investors remained
uncertain about OPEC's intentions after June, when the cartel's
current production quota expires. The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries hasn't revealed whether it will raise or lower
output for the rest of the year, although speculation is that the
cartel will boost production slightly.
   OPEC agreed to its current quota of 18.5 million barrels a day
last November after the cartel flooded the market with oil and
prices sank to 1986 lows. Since the accord, prices have risen more
than $5 a barrel.
