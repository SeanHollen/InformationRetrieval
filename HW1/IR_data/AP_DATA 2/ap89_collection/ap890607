   Embassies scrambled to evacuate their citizens
from China on Thursday, and hundreds of troop trucks roared into the
capital to reinforce the military occupation after Beijing's turmoil
spread to more than a dozen cities.
   The United States ordered embassy dependents to leave the
country, one day after Chinese soldiers, saying they were looking
for a sniper, sprayed a diplomatic compound with gunfire.
   Trucks, many piled high with supplies, rolled into central
Tiananmen Square for more than an hour Thursday. Some carried troops
with rifles aimed at people bicycling along the road. It was not
immediately known whether these were the same troops, the 27th Army,
that left the city in two large convoys Wednesday.
   The 27th was responsible for killing and wounding thousands of
people when it stormed the city Saturday to wrest control of
Tiananmen from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. U.S.
intelligence estimates put the death toll at 3,000.
   Beijing is also surrounded by armies said to oppose the harsh
martial law crackdown, setting the stage for a possible battle
between rival military factions. Reports surfaced of skirmishes
between soldiers, but no serious clashes.
   Diplomats estimate 200,000 soldiers from 13 army groups have
moved into the capital area.
   In Washington, the State Department urged all Americans to leave
China at once, calling the situation ``volatile, uncertain and
increasingly dangerous.'' It ordered the evacuation of 258
diplomatic dependents.
   The United States chartered commercial planes to supplement
regular U.S. airline departures from China, and officials organized
transportation to help U.S. citizens get to airports, department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   At Tiananmen Thursday morning, about 10,000 troops stood in
formation, did drills or jogged around the 100-acre square.
   About 40 tanks were lined up on the north end with guns pointing
in all directions. An additional 20 tanks and armored personnel
carriers were at the south end of the square. There were no signs of
anti-aircraft weapons.
   The situation in the provinces was deteriorating. Increasingly
violent demonstrations protested the weekend military invasion of
Beijing.
   State television broadcast a statement from the Communist Party
that any members found to have ``plotted, organized and led the
rebellion'' would be expelled and punished severely.
   The warning mentioned no names, but conservative party leaders
who ordered the crackdown were said to have singled out party chief
Zhao Ziyang as the instigator and ordered his ouster.
   Another government announcement said soldiers were authorized to
``forcibly dispose of, on the spot'' anyone who resisted arrest.
Several citizens were reported killed Wednesday.
   In the provinces, crowds protesting the army's invasion of the
capital barricaded major roads and railways in anticipation of
military assaults.
   Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, declared in Paris that
China was ``on the verge of civil war'' and the French Embassy staff
would be reduced ``to the indispensable minimum.''
   The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. decision to stop arms sales
and military contacts in protest of the bloody crackdown was a
``detriment to bilateral relations.''
   Many other nations also imposed sanctions or froze relations.
   China condemned the United States for giving refuge to dissident
Fang Lizhi, who fled to the U.S. Embassy. It accused Fang of
attacking the communist system and said Washington was interfering
in China's internal affairs.
   Chinese informants reported seeing the bodies of three people
killed by soldiers and said seven people were killed or wounded near
the railway station when a convoy of thousands of troops sped toward
the eastern suburbs Wednesday morning.
   While no major fighting has materialized between the 27th Army
and supposedly rival military units on the edges of the city, a
witness said the 27th and 38th armies, based in Hebei and Beijing
respectively, fought each other with automatic weapons early
Wednesday about 12 miles east of downtown.
   The witness believed two bystanders were killed but was not sure
about military casualties.
   Ms. Tutwiler said there were some clashes between small army
units.
   State television showed Chinese reporters Wednesday on a tour of
garbage-strewn Tiananmen Square. Soldiers appeared to be sparsely
deployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperial
palace.
   ``Not one person died on the square,'' a martial law official
said. Witnesses and students driven from the square after a
three-week protest said hundreds were shot down or crushed by tanks
during the invasion early Sunday.
   China's top leaders have not appeared since the crackdown began
and official media report little about the violence.
   In Washington, a Bush administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said U.S. officials believe 84-year-old Deng
Xioaping, China's senior leader who has been reported in ill health
``is still alive ... and still running the show.''
   In other cities:
   _Six people were run over by a train while manning a barricade
near the Shanghai railway station Tuesday night. Shanghai radio said
angry crowds set the train ablaze and beat 21 railway security
officials who tried to put the fire out.
   _Tens of thousands of people in Xian blocked roads and held
anti-government demonstrations. Xian radio said the unrest ``wrecked
the city's life.''
   _In Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, provincial radio said 100 people
were arrested after a ``gang of scoundrels'' stormed city offices
and beat up 300 security officials on Sunday. The radio did not
comment on unconfirmed reports that 20 people died killed in clashes
with security forces.
   _The Heilongjiang Daily in Harbin, northeastern China, said
roadblocks severely affected public transport and the situation was
``extremely serious.''
   _Also in the northeast, the mayor of Changchun said people
blocked factory gates and ``if this situation continues, the city's
economy will be paralyzed.''
   Embassies arranging flights for nationals included those of
Austria, Britain, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, Switzerland and
West Germany.
   U.S. Embassy press spokesman Andy Koss said 125 embassy
dependents would leave on a special commercial flight Thursday and
73 dependents from four U.S. consulates leave as soon as possible.
In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
fewer than 1,000 Americans remained in China.
   Evacuation efforts gained urgency after soldiers fired on a
diplomatic compound, then surrounded it in what they said was a
search for a sniper who killed one soldier and wounded three.
Security officials took a Chinese man away.
   Public transportation remained suspended in Beijing and shoppers
formed long lines to buy scarce, expensive vegetables and meat.
National television said postal service and milk delivery would
resume Thursday.

   President Bush on Tuesday told visiting
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that the United States is
willing ``to explore any serious avenue'' to achieve a political
solution in Afghanistan.
   Mrs. Bhutto in turn said after private talks with the president
that ``we are in complete accord'' on the situation in Afghanistan,
stalemated since the pullout of the last Soviet troops in February.
   Bush said the withdrawal of the Red Army proved the effectiveness
of U.S-Pakistani support for the Afghan resistance fighting the
Marxist regime in Kabul. Pakistan shares a common border with
Afghanistan.
   ``We agreed, however, that the job is not done,'' said Bush.
``The Mujahedeen continues and their struggle for self-determination
goes on.''
   ``Prime Minister Bhutto and I discussed ways to encourage a
political solution in Afghanistan that will lead to a non-aligned,
representative government willing to live in peace with its
neighbors, to replace the illegitimate regime in Kabul,'' said Bush.
``The United States and Pakistan will continue to explore any
serious avenue towards this end.''
   U.S. officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government
of Najibullah after the Soviet pullout, but it has not happened.
   Mrs. Bhutto said she and Bush ``have reviewed the situation in
the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete
accord'' on what needs to be done.
   ``Pakistan remains committed to a political solution of the
Afghan problem, whereby the brave people of Afghanistan will have
the right to freely choose their own government without interference
from outside,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bhutto, the daughter of former Prime Minister Ali Bhutto,
said that while the Soviet pullout ``has brought a welcome change in
Afghanistan, the continued fighting and prolonged presence of over
3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace and
stability of the region.''
   After a full-dress military ceremony on the White House lawn,
including a 19-gun salute, and an Oval Office meeting with Bush,
Mrs. Bhutto went to the State Department for a meeting with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and a lunch in her honor.
   At a state dinner Tuesday evening, Bush joked during the exchange
of toasts that Mrs. Bhutto had ``refused my latest offer. She's not
going double or nothing on this year's Harvard-Yale game.''
   Keeping up the Ivy League banter, Mrs. Bhutto responded: ``Ladies
and gentlemen, I studied at Harvard and believe me, I didn't know
until tonight that Yale ever produced charming men. I'm glad I met
the only one.''
   Mrs. Bhutto is a 1973 Harvard graduate; Bush is a 1948 graduate
of arch-rival Yale.
   Pakistan has a standing request to buy 60 more F-16 fighter jets
from the United States. Bush brushed aside reporters' attempts to
ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent.
   An administration official, briefing reporters at the White
House, said Bush and Mrs. Bhutto discussed the F-16 sale, but ``I
wouldn't anticipate any specific announcement from outside'' during
her visit. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
indicated there were no stumbling blocks to the sale, but normal
steps such as congressional notification would take more time.
   On another topic, Bush said Mrs. Bhutto ``assured me that
Pakistan's nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes.''
   He said he underlined his commitment ``to discourage
proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles,
in the South Asia region and around the world.''
   In an interview with editors of The Washington Post, Mrs. Bhutto
said she had ``very frank talk'' with Bush and CIA Director William
Webster, and assured them Pakistan does not intend to build nuclear
weapons.
   She said she wanted Bush to help Pakistan reach a nuclear
test-ban treay with ``other countries in the region,'' an apparent
reference to long-ti8me rival India, according to a report on the
interview in Wednesday editions.
   India exploded what it called a nuclear ``device'' in 1974.
Webster last month said Pakistan ``clearly'' was developing nuclear
capability and Indian appeared interested in developing
thermonculear weapons.
   The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production
and trafficking. Bush said he ``applauded her tough stance on
eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for extraditing
an alleged drug trafficker.
   The two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing,
narcotics and education this week during Bhutto's stay. Pakistan,
the third largest recipient of U.S. aid, is slated for $380 million
in economic assistance and $240 million in military aid next year.
   Mrs. Bhutto's father was deposed by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in
1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder. Zia remained
in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last year that
also claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and an
American general.
   Mrs. Bhutto, who had picked up her father's fallen standard and
been jailed for a time under Zia, led her Pakistan People's Party to
victory as head of a coalition government last November.
   Mrs. Bhutto was scheduled to address a joint session of Congress
on Wednesday. She also had stops here at the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund. She will receive an honorary degree at
her alma mater, Harvard University, on Thursday and visit the United
Nations on Friday. She departs for home Saturday evening.

   Network audiences are doing their summer tune-out
as the prime-time schedule fills up with reruns.
   For the week ending June 4, the three networks had a combined
audience share of 59, the lowest since last September when it dipped
to 58.
   The only shows that aren't in reruns are news programs and the
occasional pilot that didn't make it to series. But NBC got a
surprising reaction to ``Shannon's Deal,'' which landed in the top
10 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last week.
   The two-hour pilot, about a former corporate lawyer who lost it
all because of a gambling problem, was written by independent
filmmaker John Sayles (``Eight Men Out'') and aired as NBC's Sunday
movie.
   ``Shannon's Deal'' had a 14.5 rating and 25 share and ranked
10th, in a tie with CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' NBC had been saying there
were no plans to take the pilot to series, although Sayles has
written two more episodes. After the ratings came in, the network
said it was considering keeping the show around.
   ``Shannon's Deal'' dealt a poor hand to its competition on CBS,
``The Tony Awards,'' honoring the year's finest on Broadway. It had
its lowest rating ever, a 9.3 and 16 share.
   NBC won the week, its 50th in a row, with an average prime-time
rating of 12.7. ABC came in second with a 9.6. CBS had a 9.4.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the top-rated show of the week, followed
by NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and
``Dear John,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' CBS' ``Murder, She
Wrote,'' ABC's ``Have Faith'' and ``Who's the Boss?'' then
``Shannon's Deal and ``60 Minutes.''
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' was first in last week's news race
with an 8.9 rating and 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had an 8.4
and 19 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.7 and 18.

   Governments around the world tried to evacuate their
citizens from Beijing Tuesday as an outpouring of protest and
condemnation of the bloodshed in the Chinese capital continued.
   Britain and Switzerland joined the United States in banning
military sales to China _ the toughest measures announced by the
many countries protesting Beijing's military crackdown on
demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead.
   France, Holland and Sweden froze political relations, barring
contacts involving Chinese government officials.
   The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li Qin
Ping and told him Holland ``is exceptionally shocked by the violent
and brutal actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.''
   Austria also delivered a firm message to the Chinese ambassador
in Vienna and the orchestra of Vienna University scheduled a
commemorative concert for the Chinese victims.
   Dutch government officials canceled a state visit to China by
Queen Beatrix, and British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said
a November visit by Prince Charles and Princess Diana ``cannot take
place as long as those responsible for the atrocities ... remain in
control of the Chinese government.''
   Howe also said Britain will not allow mass immigration from the
colony of Hong Kong, due to be handed over to China in 1997. He said
an open door policy ``could more than double the ethnic minority
population of the United Kingdom.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said earlier that about 3.5
million Hong Kong Chinese eligible for British passports will not be
given the right of residence in Britain but Britain will show
``greater flexibility'' about immigration from Hong Kong.
   She expressed ``utter revulsion'' at the Chinese crackdown and
said, ``We will be thinking how best to demonstrate that in
practical ways.''
   Howe announced Britain immediately is banning arms sales to China
due to the ``slaughter of innocent people'' and banned military
contacts and visits by senior Chinese officials.
   The Defense Ministry refused to say what arms Britain sells to
China but the Britain's Independent Television said sales amounted
to $4.68 million a year.
   Washington sells China more than $600 million of military
equipment a year, and private U.S. dealers do about $85 million
worth of military sales with Beijing.
   Francois Godet, a Swiss Defense Department official, said the ban
marks the first time Switzerland has withdrawn approval from
contracts already agreed. he declined to say how much the contracts
are worth, but sources said they amounted to a few million dollars.
   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said his government is not
considering economic sanctions against China but Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe said that because of the situation aid
projects ``cannot go on.''
   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China and the
assistance, most in the form of loans, totaled $6.1 billion as of
1987, the latest figures available.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community strongly condemned the
Chinese action and appealed to authorities to stop using force. But
it did not propose any joint protest measures.
   People in Singapore copied a protest started in Hong Kong on
Monday by withdrawing deposits from Bank of China branches. A crowd
formed outside the bank, where a senior official said three to four
times more people than usual withdrew money. He said he did not know
how much was withdrawn.
   Meanwhile, many governments warned their citizens in China to
leave the country or take strict security precautions as reports
spread of Chinese soldiers battling each other in Beijing.
   The U.S. State Department urged the 1,440 Americans in Beijing to
leave and planned arrangements for U.S. airlines to fly them to
safety.
   British Airways said the British Embassy in Beijing chartered a
Boeing 747 to evacuate Britons to Hong Kong.
   About 50 Canadians, heeding advice from Ottowa to leave
immediately, flew out Tuesday, and 200 more were to leave on a
special flight Wednesday, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in
Beijing said.
   The Australian government chartered a jumbo jet to evacuate its
citizens and Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the increasing
violence indicates ``the larger potential for really full-scale
civil war erupting.''
   Japan arranged for two special commercial flights to Beijing
Tuesday to help its citizens leave and Foreign Ministry officials
said further flights were planned, pending permission from Chinese
authorities.
   New Zealand and Switzerland also hired jets for evacuations.
   Achille Occetto, head of Italy's Communist Party, urged the
Kremlin to take a strong stance against the massacre and distanced
his party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. Italy has
the largest communist party in the West.
   In Moscow members of the Congress of Peoples Deputies called on
China's leaders to use ``wisdom, reason and a weighted approach''
but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry has
made no comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fences
after decades of estrangement.
   Protesters, mainly Chinese students, demonstrated outside Chinese
embassies in Stockholm, Sweden; Madrid, Spain; Abu Dhabi, United
Arab Emirates; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; the Hague in the Netherlands;
Athens Greeceother and other cities.
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, the pro-government newspaper The
Citizen questioned why South Africa is the target of international
boycotts ``when whatever faults we have are tiny by comparison ...
to the horror of the massacre of Beijing.''
   East German state newspapers indirectly took sides with the
Chinese government's use of force.
   The Junge Welt newspaper appealed to East Germans not to believe
media reports that bore the ``viewpoint of Western politics'' and
gave ``good grades to those holding out in Tiananmen Square to
protest the government, and bad grades to those calling for calm and
reconciliation.''

   Ahmad Khomeini has emerged from the long
shadow of his father and appears to be making a bid for power
himself, a move some analysts believe is doomed to fail.
   He was making his moves even before Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
died Saturday. But the death of Iran's revolutionary and spiritual
patriarch, before the leadership issue could be settled, has added
urgency to the son's campaign.
   ``A lot of emotions are rampant in Iran now,'' Shahram Chubin, an
Iran specialist with the Graduate Institute of International Studies
in Geneva, said in a telephone interview.
   ``Some people will be trying to take advantage of that and Ahmad
is one of them.''
   The Assembly of Experts, the body formed in 1979 to ensure a
smooth transition after Khomeini's death, on Sunday named President
Ali Khamenei as a caretaker leader until the succession is resolved.
In the meantime, rivals in Tehran are jockeying for power.
   Although Ahmad Khomeini is only a middle-ranking cleric, or
hojatoleslam, and holds no official title, he was one of his
father's closest advisers.
   As Khomeini's private secretary, he controlled access to the
reclusive patriarch and wielded considerable influence behind the
scenes.
   The younger Khomeini, 43, took an increasingly high public
profile as his father's health declined.
   He has allied himself with radical figures in the hierarchy in
the power struggle that has intensified since the Aug. 20 cease-fire
in the war with Iraq.
   Speculation rose that he sought to establish himself as his
father's political heir by engineering the March 28 dismissal of his
father's designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri.
   Ahmad was his father's eyes and ears since their days in exile
and through the Islamic revolution that toppled the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   Last month, Tehran newspapers published lengthy excerpts of a
110-page memorandum Ahmad wrote to Montazeri, lashing him for
seeking to undermine Khomeini's regime and consorting with
opposition groups.
   The document appeared to be aimed at publicly projecting Ahmad
Khomeini as a candidate to inherit his father's mantle.
   Masoud Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy
Warriors, the main Iranian opposition movement, says Khomeini was
grooming Ahmad as his successor.
   Rajavi said in a statement that Khomeini's dismissal of Montazeri
for criticizing the regime ``prepared the ground for this
appointment.''
   He argued that Khomeini's appointment of a special committee to
amend the constitution, including downgrading the religious
qualifications of his successor from ``divinely inspired authority''
was aimed at making room for Ahmad.
   But analysts believe the black-bearded Ahmad could eventually
become a political casualty now that his father is dead.
   They believe that bereft of the ayatollah's authority, and with
no secure power base of his own, Ahmad's influence could evaporate.
   ``As Khomeini's health deteriorated, he was able to control his
father's statements and this gave him some authority,'' Chubin said.
   ``But it would be rather difficult for him to be the keeper of
the flame now that Khomeini has gone. Ahmad has neither the
religious credentials nor the administrative experience to rule and
it's not clear whether claiming dynastic credentials will be enough.
   ``He could become a pawn in the power struggle, a front man for
more powerful people following his father's death.''
   Iran specialist Shireen Hunter, of Washington's Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said in a telephone interview:
``I don't think he'll emerge as Iran's strongman.
   ``His power is really quite vicarious, stemming primarily from
his position as his father's gatekeeper. I don't believe he can fill
his father's shoes.'' With 40 days of mourning declared for
Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran has been engulfed by a wave of emotion for
its dead leader, a development Ahmad could exploit to advance his
political ambitions.
   But Ms. Hunter cautioned: ``Using Khomeini's name could be a
double-edged sword. There was already a backlash against Khomeini
and that in the end could work against Ahmad. The revolution is
against dynasties.
   ``He could well become a major player ... but he's not a person
of great convictions and he'll have to associate himself with one
group or another to stay in play.''
   From the outside, the political maneuverings in Tehran are often
opaque. But last August, Ahmad was seen as a member of an unofficial
troika with Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Khamenei, both
so-called ``pragmatists,'' who had effectively taken over day-to-day
control as Khomeini's health failed.
   Now he's aligned with the radicals led by Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha, Intelligence
Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri and Mohammad Tavasoli, a powerful
behind-the-scenes figure in Tehran.
   Some analysts believe Ahmad could swing back to Rafsanjani again
if he sees him gaining ground.
   But for now he's lined up against Rafsanjani, who was earlier
outflanked by the radicals in the fundamentalist resurgence decreed
by his father in February.
   Rafsanjani, one of Iran's shrewdest politicians, appears to be
maneuvering his way back and could well come out on top again, as he
has done many times before.
   There is speculation Ahmad will run in presidential elections
scheduled for Aug. 18.
   So far the only announced candidate is the formidable Rafsanjani,
who won the highest ballot in last year's parliamentary elections
with more than 1.3 million votes.

<HEAD>Authorities Predict More Widespread AIDS Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. health official says the time is
coming when doctors will report the names of people testing positive
for the AIDS virus and try to trace victims' sexual contacts. But
activists criticized the proposal.
   Dr. James Mason, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health, said he
didn't know when such a system would be in place, but when it
happens ``we will have normalized HIV and will handle it like
syphilis.''
   HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
   Mason's remarks Tuesday at the Fifth International Conference on
AIDS drew immediate criticism.
   Richard Dunne, executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis
in New York, opposed the proposal because he feared names would not
be kept confidential and that people known to be infected would
suffer from the stigma associated with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``People lose their jobs, their housing and their schooling
opportunities,'' he said. ``That's not like other diseases.''
   Furthermore, he said, tracing patients' sexual contacts will not
work for AIDS as it does with syphilis because HIV patients may have
been infected for years when they are diagnosed. Tracing partners so
far back is unlikely, he said.
   The consequences of reporting would discourage many people from
submitting to testing, Dunne said. ``The only way people are going
to come forward is if there's something effective'' to help them, he
said.
   The Gay Men's Health Crisis received numerous calls Tuesday from
people who were already concerned that their names might be recorded
if they seek testing. Dr. Stephen Joseph, the New York City health
commissioner, floated a similar proposal at the AIDS meeting Monday.
   Congress has directed the U.S. Public Health Service to prepare a
report on discrimination against people with AIDS and HIV infection,
Mason said, in anticipation of moves toward reporting the names of
those tested.
   He said early identification of infected people through contact
tracing could allow them to be treated promptly with new drugs now
being tested. The cost of such treatment would run into the billions
of dollars, Mason said. He did not know where that money might come
from.
   In other conference reports:
   _ Researchers said initial studies on a new AIDS drug called CD4
showed that the medicine is safe and may reduce levels of HIV in the
body.
   The drug is a decoy intended to confuse the virus and draw it
away from the blood cells it ordinarily infects.
   In expeimental use on 18 people, Dr. Robert Yarchoan of the
National Cancer Institute found that the drug appeared to lower
virus levels in the body by about 50 percent. However, he cautioned
that this could have been a natural fluctuation instead of a result
of the drug.
   Another team found no clear evidence of virus reduction, but
researchers said they were still encouraged by the drug's potential
and said higher doses could have a greater effect.
   _In a report scheduled for presentation today, National Cancer
Institute reserachers said a recently discovered herpes virus may
accelerate the development of AIDS in people infected with HIV.
   Dr. Paulo Lusso said the virus, called HHV-6, enhanced the growth
of HIV in test tube, causing more cells to die more quickly.
   More than half of Americans, Canadians and Europeans have been
exposed to HHV-6 without any ill effects and may be capable of
passing it on, studies have shown.
   _Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said it was
now possible to predict two years in advance which patients infected
with HIV will develop AIDS. Studies suggest that a majority of
people infected with the virus get AIDS or related illnesses.
   A similar study by researchers at the University of California,
San Francisco, found that a combination of five laboratory tests can
predict which patients will develop AIDS during a four-year period.

   Thousands of the troops responsible for the bloody
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement fanned out from the city
center Wednesday, spraying gunfire as they passed Chinese and
diplomatic residential areas.
   They appeared to be taking up positions for an attack, possibly
from rival military factions which had moved into the city's
outskirts.
   Most of the troops from the 27th Army, in a convoy of hundreds of
trucks and support vehicles, appeared to be shooting into the air,
although some aimed at an apartment complex where hundreds of
diplomats and other foreigners live.
   Several dozen bullets hit the windows of apartments facing the
main street. There were no reports of injuries.
   At a nearby intersection, troops took up defensive positions
behind barricades and trees as if expecting an attack.
   Troops were also seen reinforcing positions at the Beijing
Railway Station to the east of Tiananmen Square and at the Beijing
Union Medical College Hospital northeast of the square.
   The 27th drove unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators from the
center of Beijing on early Sunday, killing hundreds in the most
violent suppression of a popular movement in Communist China's
40-year history.
   Troops from the 28th and 38th armies and soldiers from
northeastern China have moved into the city, raising fears of a
battle.
   The 27th Army is closely linked to President Yang Shangkun and
other Communist Party hardliners.
   The 28th Army is believed to back Zhao Ziyang, a moderate who
challenged the conservatives and was stripped of his post as
Communist Party leader. The 38th Army, which is based around
Beijing, reportedly refused orders to open fire on civilians and
opposed the martial law crackdown.
   There have been several skirmishes between rival military groups,
but no major clashes. An unidentified general appeared on national
television Tuesday night and denied factional divisions in the
People's Liberation Army.
   China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the United
States for what it called its ``short-sighted'' policies toward
China.
   The United States, joining other Western countries imposing
sanctions on China, has suspended arms sales and other military
contacts to protest the violent suppression of the pro-democracy
movement.
   The ministry, in a statement read on television, insisted the
situation in China is stable and there has been no change in the
nation's foreign policy.
   About 3,000 foot soldiers carrying rifles left Tiananmen Square
in two waves Wednesday. The first group of about 1,000 had packs on
their backs and marched 20 abreast. They were accompanied by a tank
and two armored personnel carriers.
   Some 400 split soon from the main group and turned toward the
south.
   Some in the second group were in plain clothes.
   The troops chanted, ``Down with corruption, we love the people,
we love the capital, we love youth, long live the Communist Party''
as they left their positions in Tiananmen Square.
   People along the sidewalks initially cheered when they heard the
chanting. But one office worker said, ``They can sing any slogan
they want but then they start shooting.''
   An undetermined number of troops and tanks remained in the square.
   Another group of 600 foot soldiers wearing red armbands was seen
advancing toward the square from the west. They appeared to be
preparing to take over traffic control.
   Thousands of foreigners are trying frantically to leave Beijing.
The U.S. Embassy has told all Americans to leave as soon as possible
and the Japanese Embassy has told the 3,000 Japanese in the city to
prepare for immediate evacuation.
   Many nations were arranging for special planes to transport their
nationals out of the country.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said Qiao Shi, one of five
members of the party's policy-making Politburo Standing Committee,
received a telegram from the Supreme People's Court supporting the
crackdown.
   The report, read on Beijing radio, was significant because the
telegram was sent to Qiao and not Zhao. Although Zhao has not been
seen publicly since May 19, officials have not confirmed he has lost
his post.
   Diplomats have often considered Qiao, 64, a top candidate to
replace Zhao. But a Chinese source said Wednesday that a family
member said Qiao had not been appointed party chief.
   Qiao generally is viewed as the party's law-and-order chief.
   Beijing radio also reported that conservative Premier Li Peng
attended a meeting Tuesday to hear reports on industrial production.
A Hong Kong newspaper reported that Li was shot in the thigh by a
young guard officer but his wounds were not serious.
   The reports were the first official indications of leadership
positions since Saturday's assault. The leadership, including senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, has not made any public appearances since the
crackdown.
   A report that Deng had died added to the chaos. The report, from
Taiwan, was denied by the government.
   The U.S. administration said it appeared likely that China's
senior leaders had left Beijing.
   Soldiers continued firing into crowds around Beijing on Tuesday
and early Wednesday. Witnesses said a small boy was killed and a
girl wounded in the head Tuesday.
   Anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing,
Chengdu, Shenyang and other cities.
   China's most famous dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, took
refuge in the U.S. Embassy. He had told The Associated Press last
week he was concerned conservatives might arrest him.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu said on television 300 people were
killed in Saturday's crackdown, including 23 students; and 7,000
were injured and 400 soldiers were missing. The evening TV news said
32 people were arrested, most of them for trying to set fire to
public buses.
   U.S. intelligence reports reaching Washington indicate 3,000
people probably were killed, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   On Tuesday afternoon, witnesses said the 27th Army fought with
soldiers from Shanxi province's 28th Army, believed loyal to Zhao.
There were no reports of casualties.
   The brief exchange, including several rounds from a tank cannon,
occurred just south of the Military Museum in western Beijing. It
followed unconfirmed reports of soldiers fighting soldiers in the
western and southeastern parts of the city.
   The People's Liberation Army is organized into about 22 Group
Armies. Each has about three divisions and totals about 40,000
soldiers.
   Hundreds of citizens flocked to the bridge at Muxudi, also in the
west, to welcome soldiers Tuesday evening who said they were from
the 38th Army.
   ``Exterminate the 27th Army! Avenge blood with blood!'' people in
the crowd chanted as they handed buns, eggs and cigarettes to the
troopers.
   ``People, do not be afraid!'' said a voice from a loudspeaker
carried by the soldiers. ``The 38th Army will not kill the people.''

   Actress Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of
the late fascist dictator of Italy, visited Judaism's holiest site
and appealed for an end to religious prejudice.
   Miss Mussolini, 23, who is here for a film in which she portrays
an Israeli soldier, visited the sacred Western Wall and the Yad
Vashem Holocaust museum and said she ``felt just sick'' after seeing
displays of Nazi atrocities.
   ``There are no words to describe those things,'' she said Tuesday.
   Miss Mussolini said she saw no irony in her visit even though her
grandfather, Benito Mussolini, was an ally of Germany's Adolf
Hitler, who perpetrated the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews died.
   ``I'm a new generation, and I want to give a message ... to
overcome all the prejudice, to say `Let's shake hands and be
friends,''' she said.
   ``I don't feel anything bad against me here,'' said Miss
Mussolini, who is also a niece of actress Sophia Loren.

   British pop star Sting, a campaigner to
protect the Amazon rain forest and native Indians, was stung by
criticism and bureaucratic hassles during a visit to the capital.
   Sting came here after a two-month international tour to raise
funds for creation of a huge Indian reservation in the Amazon jungle.
   At a meeting Monday to discuss the campaign, Mario Juruna, a
Xavante Indian and ex-congressman, accused the singer of taking
advantage of the ``purity and innocence of the Indians'' for
self-promotion: ``Why doesn't he dedicate himself to resolving the
problem of AIDS or defend the Indians of the United States?''
   Sting also was told that to visit Xingu National Park, a major
Indian reservation in central Brazil, he would have to meet the
usual bureaucratic requirements to enter the restricted area. The
red tape was waived for the singer on previous visits.
   According to news reports, Sting said nothing but later cancelled
a scheduled news conference.

   Neighbors are complaining that Aretha Franklin is
giving them a case of the blues by neglecting her house on the
city's west side.
   The two-story brick home, deeded to the singer in 1972 by her
then-husband Theodore White, was condemned last year by the city.
Now, the yard is overgrown and littered.
   ``We live in a nice neighborhood, but Aretha Franklin doesn't
care about us,'' said Theodora Stewart, who lives behind the house.
   Franklin couldn't be reached for comment. There was no answer
Tuesday morning at the office of her attorney, Harvey Tennen.
   City records show the house was bought by White and Franklin for
$18,500 in 1967, when they were married. The market value of the
house and land is about $42,500.

   Third-place CBS-TV plans to become the network
of the 1990s with more sports coverage and innovative programming,
the president of the CBS broadcast group told affiliates.
   Howard Stringer's comments Tuesday were enthusiastically received
by broadcasters attending the network's annual affiliates meeting.
   The mood was in contrast to the skepticism at last year's
meeting, which followed the network's first-ever third-place finish
in the A.C. Nielsen Co. prime-time ratings behind NBC and ABC.
   Referring to praise for CBS's news coverage of the weekend
massacre in Beijing, Stringer said: ``It gives me great pleasure to
see my old friend Dan Rather become the talk of the town again. When
people ask what Larry Tisch is going to get for $3 billion, this is
an example.'' Tisch is president of CBS.
   The broadcasters also heard from Rather and Connie Chung, who
talked by audio hookup to CBS correspondent Richard Roth in Beijing
and by television satellite to White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu in Washington.
   Sununu defended President Bush's cautious reaction to events in
China. ``We're pushing as hard as we can, but we can't push beyond
the point of constructive interaction,'' he said. ``We do not want
to give anyone cause to feel we are intervening or instigating
bloodshed.''
   Former First lady Nancy Reagan talked briefly following a
discussion on drugs by Rather, Chung and Robert Stutman, head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration in New York. Stutman said the only
effective way to fight drugs was a three-pronged assault of law
enforcement, treatment and education.
   ``I hear people blame other countries for our drug problem,''
Mrs. Reagan said, ``but the United States alone is responsible for
its drug problem. It's an illusion to think we can stop drugs by
sending troops to foreign countries when we can't even stop drug
sales in our own neighborhoods.''
   Stringer compared the battles between the three commercial
networks and cable television as Gulliver being chained down by the
tiny Lilliputians in Jonathan Swift's satire ``Gulliver's Travels.''
   ``I look on cable as the media's one-armed bandit. Viewers only
win when it comes up three bars, CBS, ABC and NBC. We spent $4
billion in Hollywood and they take our programs and charge people
money to watch.''
   The networks have long fought the cable industry's ability to use
network programming without paying a fee. Stringer also referred to
network efforts to overturn regulations by the Federal
Communications Commission prohibiting networks from participating in
the syndication market.

   When the House Republican leader warned his GOP
colleagues against a French Revolution mentality in which ``evil
Democrats'' are hauled to the guillotine, some began humming the
French national anthem.
   The incident at a party meeting Tuesday illustrates the political
blood lust that persists in a chamber fractured by months of ethics
charges and countercharges, and the uphill fight new House Speaker
Thomas Foley will have in trying to restore order.
   ``The task I see for myself is to create the environment where
... debate can take place without recriminations, without the kind
of angry, hostile feelings between members'' that have dominated the
House of late, Foley told reporters.
   ``This tension which has built up over a period of many months is
going to require a little time to turn around,'' he said. ``It's not
going to be done in a day. ... But I believe it will happen.''
   Some Democrats, stung by the sacrifice of former speaker Jim
Wright in the ethics storm, have turned their sights on Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who filed the original ethics charges against
Wright. An ethics investigation of Gingrich's book-promotion deal
could begin as early as Thursday.
   Of the ethics committee and Gingrich, Rep. Louise Slaughter,
D-N.Y., said: ``I want them to treat him fairly, but I certainly
want them to treat him.''
   The political knives remained out in the Republican camp, as
well. GOP political operatives were searching financial disclosure
reports for possible ethical shortcomings of Democrats, and Gingrich
spoke of new ethics cases yet to be filed against members of the
majority party.
   Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, who warned his
colleagues against a frenzy of political executions, blamed the
atmosphere on ``35 years of uninterrupted power'' for Democrats and
said ethics abuses won't be forgotten.
   ``I am all for putting an end to bitterness,'' Michel said. ``I
am all in favor of putting our House in order, but we won't do so by
sweeping things under the rug.''
   In an acceptance speech to the House, Foley directed many of his
comments at the Republican side, promising increased consultation
and appealing to shared values of trust and public service.
   The calming style was in sharp contrast to that of Wright. Where
Wright confronted, Foley counsels; where Wright followed his own
compass, Foley seeks advice.
   Republicans will now be looking for that style to be translated
into changes that will benefit them. Foley may be able to buy some
peace by permitting more Republican amendments to be offered to
bills on the House floor, or by bringing legislation before the
House under less restrictive rules.
   ``If he does, I'll be totally and cheerfully bipartisan,'' said
Gingrich, the GOP's chief gadfly.
   But he doubted that Foley would be able to give the Republicans
much latitude on issues they want most, such as a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution and the death penalty for drug and
other offenses. ``Those are anathema to the left wing of the
Democratic Party,'' he said.
   While he appealed for cooperation, Foley did not seek to hide his
own ideology. He openly acknowledged at a news conference that he is
a liberal, the label that Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis sought vainly to avoid last year.
   And he clearly reserved the sole right to set the House's agenda,
the prerogative of the majority.
   ``Procedurally, Tom will try to work with the Republicans to be
fair,'' said Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``I
think the difference will be he will be a fighter on issues the
Democrats stand for.''

   With President Bush vowing that the ``scourge''
of drugs will stop and drug czar William J. Bennett organizing the
troops for a full-scale war, calls for decriminalization of drug use
are like cries in the dark.
   But the cries are getting louder and have drawn together people
from disparate sides of the political spectrum _ from conservative
William F. Buckley to Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, a former
prosecutor.
   Advocates of such a stance point to a drop in crime rates
following the 1933 end of Prohibition that had outlawed liquor sales
since 1920. Today, huge drug profits and artificially high drug
prices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout the
country, they say.
   Removing the profits would remove the criminals, the argument
goes, and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessful
enforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and education
programs.
   But the Bush administration maintains the need for ``zero
tolerance'' of illicit drug use, and fighting the war on drugs _
even if it requires scarce federal financial resources _ is a
priority on Capitol Hill. In March, Bush told one group of high
school students that legalizing drugs would be ``180 degrees wrong.''
   A recent forum featuring advocates of decriminalization _
organized by the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and featuring
presentations by Schmoke, Princeton University Professor Ethan
Nadelmann and attorney James Ostrowksi _ drew attendees from
Bennett's Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Justice
Department and the Health and Human Services Department.
   The three who spoke to the forum emphasized that they weren't
advocating use of now-illicit drugs.
   ``The available evidence indicates that legalization would not
lead to an explosion in drug use. The repeal of alcohol prohibition
did not,'' said Ostrowski. ``The decriminalization of marijuana in
Alaska and the Netherlands did not. The cheap and ready access to
cocaine and narcotics in the 19th century did not.
   ``The fact is, most people in our society are capable of acting
responsibly when it comes to drugs,'' he said. ``Users of nicotine
are declining. Alcohol abusers are only a small percentage of the
population.''
   The panel members differed, however, on how much
decriminalization they want.
   Schmoke stressed that although he believes marijuana use and
sales should not have criminal penalties, he was not advocating that
sales of cocaine, heroin and other dangerous drugs be allowed in the
same manner that alcoholic beverages are now sold.
   ``The model that I think makes the most sense is the model in
Holland, in which the government treats addicts as patients and says
that you can obtain these substances from certified health
professionals,'' Schmoke said. ``But if you obtain these substances
outside the public health system, you're subject to criminal
sanctions.''
   Such a plan lowers the crime rate, because ``you don't have to
rob and steal and break into people's houses to obtain enough goods
to buy drugs,'' and it restricts the spread of AIDS that otherwise
would be transmitted through the sharing of needles, he said.
   Nadelmann said that from a strict cost-benefit analysis _
including money spent for enforcement of drug laws as well as the
cost of violence, corruption and the need for ever-expanding prisons
_ the prohibition on drugs makes no sense.
   He acknowledged that while the illegality of some drugs may make
some people, particularly those in higher socioeconomic groups, stay
away from the substances, the nation can't ignore the violence
plaguing inner cities, much of it caused by the illegality of the
drug-dealers' trade.
   Ever-increasing spending on unsuccessful enforcement makes no
sense, Nadelmann argued.
   ``Everything we've been doing in the past or that we're talking
about doing now and that people are talking about doing in the
future in terms of criminal justice approaches is doomed to
failure,'' he said. ``Twenty years of experience has shown that.
   ``And it has nothing to do with corruption in Latin America or
turf squabbles between law enforcement agencies or with whether or
not we have a drug czar or whether or not his name is William
Bennett,'' Nadelmann said. ``What it has to do with is the nature of
the market, the nature of the commodity and how lucrative the whole
thing is.''
   It's impossible to wipe out all the opium fields in the world, he
said, and it's impossible to intercept all the cocaine imported to
the United States without virtually closing down foreign trade and
sealing the borders.
   Former Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota said after the forum
that he remained undecided on the issue.
   ``I think the strongest argument is getting the criminal element
out of the drug business,'' said McGovern, who ran unsuccessfully
for president in 1972 and is now on the lecture circuit.
   But McGovern said he doubted Congress is ready to hear the
decriminalization arguments.
   ``Maybe five to 10 years down the road, you'll be getting more
serious evaluation of this side of the argument,'' he said.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Company's Subsidies, Ties to Fugitive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is reviewing a grain
company's possible links to a fugitive commodities trader in
Switzerland and its receipt of at least $65 million in government
export subsidies.
   At issue are the company's ties to Marc Rich, who fled to
Switzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion,
racketeering, mail and wire fraud.
   A department official confirmed Tuesday that USDA was examining
Richco Grain Ltd., a Swiss-based company with an office in Stamford,
Conn., and payments it received through the Export Enhancement
Program, known as EEP.
   The review was started at the request of the chairman of a House
Agriculture subcommittee, Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who raised
questions about the company at a hearing earlier this year and on
Tuesday asked the agency for a full investigation.
   Glickman, in a letter to the agency, said ``an unmistakable line
of ownership, control and profit runs from'' Richco Grain to Rich
through a series of subsidiary arrangements.
   ``While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie
outside of the United States can establish but a nominal onshore
presence and qualify to receive EEP bonuses, as appears to be the
case with Richco Grain, I am truly shocked that a fugitive from U.S.
justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer dollars,''
Glickman said in his letter to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sell
U.S. commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and
then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities
as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Richard Crowder, under secretary for international affairs and
commodity programs, said USDA had started ``checking through what
the connections are'' between Richco and Rich. He declined to
provide any details on the findings so far.
   An official of Richco, Al Church, declined to comment about the
USDA review and would not provide any information about the company.
   Glickman asked that USDA's Office of Inspector General determine
whether Richco qualified for the export subsidy program and whether
department eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any
possible loopholes used by Richco.
   Richco has the same telephone number as Clarendon AG, a U.S.
subsidiary of Marc Rich &amp; Co. A.G. of Switzerland. Clarendon and the
Marc Rich company settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by
pleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than $200 million in back
taxes, fines and other penalties.
   Criminal charges against Rich were unaffected by the settlement.
The government alleged that Rich and his commodity-trading empire
cheated the government out of millions of dollars in taxes through a
series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled companies.
   Richco has received at least $65 million worth of subsidies
through EEP, ranking it ninth among grain exporters in the program,
according to information supplied to a House committee by USDA. Most
recently, Richco picked up estimated subsidies of $250,000 for a
wheat sale to the Soviet Union.
   Last month, President Bush approved use of the subsidy program
for the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. Richco
handled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal.
Subsidies averaged $8.46 per ton for Richco and four other
companies, according to USDA.
   Glickman, who met Tuesday with Yeutter and Crowder, said Congress
might need to pass legislation disqualifying Richco from the export
program unless USDA administratively barred it from receiving more
subsidies.
   ``The export enhancement program has undergone some criticism
anyway. It would be a shame to jeopardize its future because we're
providing bonus commodities to a tax fugitive,'' said Glickman.
``This is a guy of renowned international bad dealings.''

<HEAD>NRA Tries to Counter Police Endorsements of Gun Bans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While several police organizations are urging
Congress to approve strict controls on semiautomatic assault-style
weapons, some 225 officers gathered on Capitol Hill to say those
groups don't speak for them.
   ``The average policeman in America right now is extremely upset
with the misrepresentations,'' said Patrolman Thomas J. Aveni Jr.,
who asked that his department be identified only as being in Camden
County, N.J.
   The notion that policemen favor ``gun bans as a solution to
violent crime'' is wrong, said Aveni, who recently organized a group
called Law Enforcement for the Preservation of the Second Amendment,
which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms.
   ``The majority of us have taken an oath to uphold the
Constitution,'' he said in an interview. ``The Second Amendment's
the cornerstone of the Constitution. If the Second Amendment goes,
there's no guarantee that the rest of the Constitution will remain
intact. ... Without arms, people are powerless to dissent against
any kind of tyranny or repression of government.''
   Aveni was one of the 225 officers flown to Washington by the
National Rifle Association to participate in a news conference
Tuesday and lobby their respective congressmen and senators. The
only state not represented by an officer was Hawaii.
   They were here to combat the impact of gun-control endorsements
by law enforcement officials such as Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl
Gates and Baltimore County Police Chief Neil Behan, who are pushing
for controls on assault-style weapons including semiautomatic
versions of the AK-47 and Uzi.
   Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include the
National Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the National
Association of Police Organizations and the Police Executive
Research Forum.
   ``For thousands of us out there that the chiefs, the appointed
officials, do not speak for the law enforcement officers that are in
the field, in the trenches, doing the job,'' said Patrolman Ray
Maples, president of the Memphis Police Association.
   But Stephen Brown, counsel to the National Fraternal Order of
Police, countered that his organization speaks for 200,000 of those
officers, not for their bosses.
   ``The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on the
street,'' Brown said. ``There are no chiefs, there are no sheriffs.
They don't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.''
   The contention by some law enforcement leaders that their
officers are being ``outgunned'' by criminals wielding assault-style
weapons ``offends me,'' Officer Leroy Pyle of the San Jose, Calif.,
Police Department said at the news conference.
   Santa Monica, Calif., Officer Gary Steiner said criminals have
better firearms because they're making more money these days.
   ``Unfortunately, police departments have for many years been
forced to look at the bottom line in terms of low bid, and that
applies to our safety equipment in particular,'' Steiner said.
   Cincinnati Police Lt. Harry Thomas said many of the officers
attending were ``under direct orders from their police chiefs to
disassociate themselves from their respective police departments''
in their comments.
   ``The remarks that are made here should not be construed as the
official policy of our respective police departments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Reports Give Differing Views of Airline Hubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The domination of an airport by a single
airline is either a blow or a boon to competition and low fares,
depending on whose report you believe.
   The General Accounting Office, in a study released today, says
air fares average 27 percent more per passenger mile at 15 major hub
airports than fares at non-hubs. It said competition has decreased
on many routes.
   The airline industry's Air Transport Association, in a 60-airport
study made public Tuesday, said competition is up and average fares
at two-thirds of the nation's hub airports have decreased in the
last four years. It says average fares at 30 hub airports are only
1.5 percent higher than at non-hubs.
   Direct comparisons between the two studies are not possible
because they deal with different statistics, each putting its own
slant on the controversy over the practice of major airlines of
routing a large share of their flights through a single airport.
   Both studies agree, however, that fares generally have decreased
since deregulation a decade ago and that the establishment of hub
airports has brought greater efficiency to commercial aviation. Hubs
enable airlines to consolidate maintenance and other operations at
one or two airports.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on
aviation today was looking into the effects of the hub system on
passenger fares and competitition among the airlines. Both studies
have been submitted to the subcommittee.
   The study by the GAO, which is the investigative arm of Congress,
says fares for dominant airlines at 13 of the 15 hubs studied were
higher than fares for other airlines serving the same airports.
   It also says fares for the airlines rose after they established
the dominant position at the hub airports. Comparisons were made
with 38 non-hub airports.
   In showing decreased competition, the GAO report says that after
a single airline gained dominance at an airport, the number of
destinations served by four or more airlines fell 52 percent while
the number served by only one carrier increased 25 percent.
   ``Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can
also lead to substantial market power for the airlines, which could
lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service,'' said GAO
official Kenneth M. Mead in testimony prepared for the subcommittee
hearing.
   The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of
Simat, Helliesen &amp; Eichner for the ATA concludes that despite
increased concentration within the industry and at some airports,
competition in individual markets has increased.
   ``There is very little, if any, significant relationship between
average fares and airline concentration at either hub or non-hub
airports,'' the study says.
   ``The hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive
national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to
the American public,'' said Robert Aaronson, ATA president.
   The industry study says that higher levels of service, such as
more non-stop flights, account for higher average fare levels at
some hubs.
   But the association said passengers have the option of flying
multi-stop flights or connecting flights at lower fares.
   The ATA said its study looked at airline schedules at 25 airports
fed by hubs and found that they are now servied by an average of
nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978, prior to deregulation of
the industry.

   Major airlines in April flew more on-time
flights, lost less baggage and received fewer complaints, according
to the Transportation Department's monthly consumer report.
   Airlines reported the highest on-time rate in six months _ 83.4
percent, an 11 percent improvement over the previous month. Delays
due to mechanical problems were not counted in the report released
Tuesday.
   Passengers filed reports of lost baggage in April at the rate of
6.15 for every 1,000 passengers, compared with 7.53 in March. This
also was the lowest total in six months.
   Complaints against individual airlines continued a long downward
trend, with 876 filed with the government in May, down from 933 in
April. The May figure was 53 percent below the 1,859 complaints
received in May 1988.
   The department maintains a file of consumer information for more
than 20,000 flights. Airlines and travel agents have access to
performance data for specific flights.

<HEAD>The Folks in `The People's House' Go Ceremonial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House loves to call itself ``The People's
House'' and its members like to act like folks.
   On high state occasions, like Tuesday's, when the House installed
a new speaker, it has to go ceremonial but it couldn't quite shed
its old-shoe habits.
   When Thomas S. Foley had been duly elected, the doorkeeper
bellowed out, just as he does on State of the Union night, ``Mister
Speaker!,'' introducing new Speaker Thomas S. Foley to departing
Speaker Jim Wright.
   And Foley marched the route of presidents: down the central
aisle, accompanied by an escorting committee, shaking hands all
round.
   But still, the House is the House. So some members brought their
children to work, to be there for the history of it all, and plunked
them on the plush brown leather seats. Six of the kids sat in one
row.
   One tried to figure out how his white sailor hat could be made to
fit his knee. Another tried out his sunglasses against the bright
lights. When the adults stood and applauded, so did the kids.
   To old timers in the galleries, the moment brought to mind
another occasion when a popular product of the House stood before
the chamber at the climax of a tense national drama.
   That was 1974, when Gerald R. Ford, the former House Republican
leader, arrived as president, having succeeded Richard Nixon, a
chief executive who resigned in disgrace, largely due to the House's
own impeachment process.
   ``Mister Speaker!'' the doorkeeper bellowed then, too, but Ford
showed the members that he was still a man of the House with a corny
line; he was, he said, the same old guy: ``I am a Ford, not a
Lincoln.''
   The ethical troubles which compelled Jim Wright to resign as
speaker were no Watergate, but within the House, an insular body,
the trauma was almost comparable.
   Foley had no catchy line like Ford's but he called up some
numbers to deal with something Ronald Reagan and others had been
saying about the House _ that it has become a self-perpetuating body.
   Reagan, just before leaving office, noted that 98 percent of
House members who ran for re-election won and concluded it was
easier to be re-elected to the House than to the Supreme Soviet.
   Foley's answer: ``Only 7 percent of the House's current members
were in the House when I was first elected in 1964. Eight-one
percent of the current members have been elected since 1974. More
than half of the current members _ 55 percent _ have been elected
since 1980. The constant change in membership is a source of great
strength for the House, but fundamentally, and more importantly, the
House reflects the will of the electorate.''
   Foley had another comparison. He contrasted the transfer of power
here with the awkward reaching toward democratic formulas in Moscow
and Warsaw and the bloody events in Beijing. He said congressmen can
be proud that the values which have sustained the House ``now sweep
around the world.''
   ``We are,'' he said, using that phrase again, ``proud to call
this the People's House, the fundamental institution of American
democracy.''

<HEAD>Panel Told of Failures to Protect Elderly From Financial Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is not doing enough to keep the
elderly from being ripped off by people appointed to handle their
Social Security checks, senators said after being told of abuses.
   An Arkansas woman and a California woman misused Social Security
payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly
beneficiaries, the Senate Special Committee on Aging was told
Tuesday at a hearing.
   Elizabeth Freeland of Sacramento, Calif., testified that she was
told by the government that she needed a representative to handle
her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the
money herself.
   But she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the
benefits for herself, and had a history of writing bad checks. She
did not identify the appointee.
   Mary Miller of Marvell, Ark., told the panel that her
representative collected her disability benefits, but then refused
to use the money to buy a telephone, clothes or other necessities
that Miller requested.
   ``She often would not tell me how much money she would have of
mine, or what was going on,'' she said.
   The system is so ripe for abuse that ``in some communities in our
nation, private profiteers are virtually lining up at Social
Security offices in the hope they can get their hands on a
beneficiary's money by being appointed a payee,'' said Curtis Child,
attorney for a legal services firm in Sacramento.
   He called the government's oversight of the payee program ``lax.''
   About 4.6 million Social Security beneficiaries have mental or
physical impairments deemed serious enough that they need someone to
manage their benefits.
   The Social Security Administration accepts applications from
anyone who wants to be a payee, but gives preference to relatives or
to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly
affairs.
   But Sens. David Pryor, D-Ark., and John Heinz, R-Pa., said the
government has not been vigilant enough in overseeing the program.
   ``There is some evidence that SSA has not been keeping a close
watch on those who apply to be representative payees,'' Heinz said.
``Presently, the SSA does not do background checks, nor does the SSA
monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually
receive their money.''
   Louis Enoff, an SSA deputy commissioner, said the administration
recognized there was a problem, and was evaluating steps to remedy
it. He said the victims represent a small percentage of the
beneficiarfies and are often poor or handicapped people without
relatives to care for them.
   Enoff said SSA verifies the identities of payee applicants, and
asks them whether they have felony convictions.
   He said he was concerned about a bill introduced by Pryor and
Heinz on Tuesday that would require SSA to conduct criminal
background checks on applicants, while barring most creditors from
becoming payees.
   A ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep, for
example, helpful landlords from becoming payees, Enoff said.

<HEAD>U.N. Optimistic Sudanese Relief Supplies to Arrive in June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.N. officials in charge of Sudan's famine
relief operation say an agreement between rebels and the government
to allow safe transit of emergency supplies could help save up to
100,000 Sudanese lives.
   The delivery of food and other supplies _ before the rainy season
cuts off access by dirt roads and airstrips _ is behind schedule but
recent accords between guerrillas and the government improve the
survival prospects for thousands, James P. Grant, head of Operation
Lifeline Sudan, said Tuesday.
   ``It's going to be a very difficult summer and fall, but I think
at this stage, barring a collapse of the present sort of pattern of
cooperation, I think we can say that the great majority of those
100,000 deaths that looked so likely in February and early March can
be averted,'' the U.N. official said.
   More than 60,000 tons of food has already been delivered, and the
relief operation is attempting to deliver another 20,000 to 40,000
tons before the heaviest rains hit in July and August, Grant said.
   ``For the first time in history, there is, in the middle of a
civil war, a plan of action agreed to by both parties with
`corridors of tranquility' for the passage of supplies,'' said
Grant, who returned from observing the operation last week.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) is fighting for
more autonomy in the southern provinces, where the government
generally controls only garrison towns.
   A railway route from central to southern Sudan is now open, said
Grant. One rail trip was completed in late May; another is set to
begin Saturday, and two more runs are planned later this month.
   The first train, with over 100 cars, moved south through rebel
and government-held areas, reaching war-weary Aweil on May 28.
   ``At one government garrison where the train stopped overnight,
the train was so long that the SPLA was guarding the tail end of the
train while the government was guarding the front of the train,''
Grant said.
   The government and rebels have both agreed to respect the
``corridors of tranquility'' as long as necessary, said Grant.
   In addition, both parties have agreed to meet in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, on Saturday to open talks aimed at reaching a
comprehensive truce.
   The SPLA has also announced it is extending its monthlong
unilateral cease-fire for another two weeks, said Grant.
   Although the rainy season has already begun, Operation Lifeline
Sudan has not yet lost the use of all dirt roads and airstrips, he
said.
   Bulldozers have been able to keep open dirt roads linking Kenya
with southern Sudan so truck convoys can pass, and the relief
operation has been able to use lighter planes to land on rain-sodden
dirt airstrips.
   However, a barge convoy planned for the Blue Nile between Kosti
and Malakal has not yet been able to start, said Grant. Negotiations
with the government, unions and barge crews are still under way.
   Despite that setback and other delays, Grant said he was ``more
optimistic for the prospects for success than at any time in the
past.''
   The United Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year from
starvation due to flood or drought, or war-induced famine.

<HEAD>Hearing Pits Animal Rights Groups, Veal Producers</HEAD>

   The chef of an exclusive French restaurant says
veal producers who confine calves in small stalls and feed them
no-iron formula to get pure white meat have a mistaken idea of what
the best cooks want.
   ``As a chef, the quality of the veal used in my kitchen is very
important, and yet of equal concern to me is the quality of life of
these calves,'' said Jean-Louis Palladin of Jean-Louis restaurant at
the Watergate Hotel, in support of legislation that would change the
way veal is raised.
   Palladin was one of 34 witnesses Tuesday at a House Agriculture
subcommittee hearing in a debate over whether calves destined to
become cuts of milk-fed veal ought to spend their short lives in a
freer state consuming more than just liquid.
   The legislation pits animal rights advocates against government
agriculture officials and most of the relatively small U.S. veal
industry.
   Palladin and others supporting the bill sponsored by Rep. Charles
Bennett, D-Fla., said the rationale behind current practice is that
the public wants pure white meat.
   ``For me, the foremost concern is the taste, not the color of the
meat,'' said Palladin. He said he thinks the confinement of calves
in small crates can lead to weakness, illness and use of antibiotics
in milk formulas, all of which affect the quality of the meat.
   But Wanda Cooper, who has been raising calves in Michigan since
1976, said ``disease problems were nothing short of horrifying''
when she and her husband tried letting the animals roam.
   ``We had no control over the amount of milk calves could drink at
will. Weak calves were pushed aside. Navel sucking, ear sucking and
urine drinking were common,'' she said.
   Dr. John McGlone, associate professor of animal science at Texas
Tech University, said there is no scientific evidence that solid
food is better for calves than a milk formula with nutrients.
   In answer to concerns about the lack of iron in calves' diets,
McGlone said, ``Borderline anemia of veal calves does not cause
serious health problems.''
   He said many of those attacking the industry actually have a
broader goal of ending all human consumption of meat.
   ``The veal industry is a small segment of American agriculture,''
McGlone said. ``Because of its small size, it is a relatively easy
target for advocate roups that seek to reduce or eliminate use of
animals by humans.''
   The Bennett bill would require that calves be given solid food
and iron, have physical contact with one another and be kept in
larger enclosures.
   ``The crate system most commonly used in the United States is so
confining that the calves cannot turn around or lie down
comfortably,'' said Michael Fox, of the Humane Society of the United
States.
   ``These normally playful animals are kept practically immobile,
are prone to be unhealthy and lead a miserable existence,'' said Fox.
   Dr. Franklin Loew, dean of Tufts University school veterinary
medicine, said veal stalls commonly are 22 to 24 inches wide and 60
inches long. He said calves average 239 pounds when they are
slaughtered.
   Dr. R. D. Plowman, administrator of the Agriculture Department's
agricultural research service, said about 1 million of the nearly 40
million cattle slaughtered each year are special-fed calves at the
center of this controversy.
   ``There is a general perception that calves are purposely made
iron deficient or anemic to produce the desired coloration of the
meat.'' said Plowman. ``This is not true.''
   He said research shows that raising calves in elevated,
individual stalls reduces disease and increases survival rates. When
calves nuzzle each other, they pass along infections, he said.

   Even as Jim Wright nominated Thomas S. Foley as
Speaker of the House in a somber speech on the floor, workers were
trundling his possessions out of the speaker's ceremonial office on
canvas-covered carts.
   Wright spent his final moments as speaker Tuesday holding his
regular pre-session news conference but revealed little about his
plans or his state of mind.
   He declared simply, ``I feel fine.''
   Last week Wright announced he was giving up the speakership and
his House seat after charges of ethics rules violations that
virtually paralyzed the House.
   By next week, Wright said, he would be ``enjoying life, I hope
and trust, rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and
the opportunities that have been given me in life.''
   Colleagues said they expected the Texas Democrat to keep a hand
in political affairs.
   ``He is healthy and well and feeling good and he's going to be
able to contribute to political debate and thought for many years,''
said Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas.
   Wright has said he will resign his seat later this month.
   As giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard
boxes stuffed full of folders, frames and plaques in his staff's
adjacent office, Wright was asked if he had any parting words.
   ``I might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a
robust discussion going,'' he told a room full of reporters. ``I
might want to write a column or two. Someone suggested I should
become a columnist. It might be a good thing. In fact, I might
discover who these unnamed sources are.''
   Just 45 minutes before he was to nominate Foley before House
Democrats, Wright closeted himself in his office with notes written
the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker.
   A floor below, outside the dining room where Texas Democrats have
met for lunch on Wednesdays with Wright as their leader, Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M., said he sensed an ``aura of hopefulness mixed
with sadness'' prevading the Capitol.
   ``For the first time in three months I feel upbeat because the
ascension of Foley promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding
the institution (of the House), which is at its lowest level,''
Richardson said.
   At the same time, he said he felt sadness for Wright, who had
campaigned for him and looked after New Mexico's interests in
Congress.
   ``But I've talked to the speaker and he's at peace with himself
and that made me feel better,'' Richardson said. ``He looks serene,
he looks comfortable ... In the last month he had looked
crestfallen.''
   Wright resigned after a year-long investigation by the House
ethics committee that produced allegations that he had violated
House ethics rules 69 times.
   The allegations surrounded sales of Wright's book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' his wife's employment by a family friend, Fort
Worth developer George Mallick, and his relationship with Mallick.
   Asked if he would write a book, Wright told reporters: ``I'm not
sure. I tried that once.''

<HEAD>Third World Falling Behind on $70 Billion Owed US Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal auditing agency says Third World
countries are falling behind on $70 billion in debt repayments to
U.S. banks and that American regulators should make banks put up
more reserves to protect depositors against loan losses.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of
Congress, did not name the debtor countries.
   Argentina, the third largest debtor behind Brazil and Mexico, has
paid no interest on its foreign debt for more than one year and owes
U.S. banks more than $8.5 billion.
   The GAO said regulators should demand that banks put up about 12
times more reserves against loan losses than is currently required.
   ``Because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by
writing down assets by the required amounts, a decline in the book
value of their assets results,'' the GAO said in a note on figures
it sent to Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., a member of the House
Banking Committee.
   Though the auditors' report did not say so, writing down a bank's
assets reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the
management look bad to depositors and stockholders.
   A bank is now only required to put up reserves when the
regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total
loss or ``value-impaired.'' That means the debtors have not paid
interest for six months or have shown in other ways that they are in
deep trouble. Bank regulators next week are expected to discuss
behind closed doors whether to put loans to Argentina in the
``value-impaired'' pigeonhole.
   The list already contains Poland, Bolivia, Peru, Zaire, Sudan,
Nicaragua and Liberia. But their total debt is small compared with
the major debtors.
   In a letter Tuesday to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, LaFalce joined in urging that the banks put up more
reserves. The Federal Reserve takes the lead in the U.S. regulation
process.
   ``U.S. banks maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other
industrialized countries,'' LaFalce wrote.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Thomas S. Foley was 30 minutes late for
his first meeting as speaker with President Bush. But Bush couldn't
have minded, since the Democratic leader was running late from a
speech that warmly praised the Republican president.
   A few days before, Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell stood
outside Bush's oceanside vacation home in Maine and publicly hailed
the president's NATO arms-control initiatives and his response to
the turmoil in China.
   At the highest levels of the nation's elective government,
sweetness and light is the prevailing theme.
   And while this harmony may be threatened by rumblings below,
including new efforts by the Republican National Committee to
discredit Foley, some political analysts are predicting a period of
rare bipartisanship ahead.
   There are some striking similarities among Bush, Foley and
Mitchell, both in matters of style and personality. And in their
appeals to bury partisan differences and work on forging consensus
positions, they often sound alike.
   Foley's acceptance speech on Tuesday following his election as
speaker echoed Bush's own inaugural address invocation of ``the age
of the offered hand'' to the Democratic leadership.
   After lavishly praising Republican Leader Robert Michel, Foley
said Republicans and Dmocrats should ``come together, put aside
bitterness and hostility.''
   Of Bush, Foley declared: ``We have one president at a time. And
he who does not wish President Bush well is no friend of the
Republic.''
   Foley then came to the White House _ late _ and the love fest
continued, with Bush telling a bipartisan group of congressional
leaders Foley's election was a ``main happening.''
   Outside, Foley told reporters, ``the problem is to turn whatever
rancorous atmosphere we have in the Congress ... back to a spirit of
conciliation and cooperation.''
   Like Bush, who kept a low profile in eight years as vice
president and in a string of top appointed jobs before then, Foley
earned a reputation for working quietly behind the scenes.
   He is far more subdued than his immediate predecessor, the highly
partisan Jim Wright, under whom Foley worked as majority leader, as
well as the colorful Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, who was speaker when
Foley was majority whip.
   Much of the same could be said of Mitchell, a former judge who
was appointed to the Senate in 1980 to fill the unexpired term of
Sen. Edmund Muskie when Muskie quit to become secretary of state.
   Even though he had no prior political experience, Mitchell went
on to win in 1982 and 1988 and became widely respected for his hard
work and even-handed approach.
   As chairman of the Senate Democratic Senatorial Committee, he
helped engineer the Democrats' recapture of the Senate in 1986.
   All three men _ Bush, Mitchell and Foley _ have been accused of
having a somewhat wooden speaking style and a low-key approach. But
all three have made large numbers of friends in both parties.
   Mitchell has even been known to hitch a ride to Maine on Air
Force Two from time to time, back when then-Vice President Bush
headed to his home in Kennebunkport on weekends in the days when he
had more time on his hands.
   ``These three men are, in a single word, professionals,'' said
William Schneider, an political analyst with the American Enterprise
Institute.
   ``Bush values professionalism, you can tell from the kind of
appointments he made. Foley worked up through the ranks, trusted and
admired by his colleagues. Mitchell was a judge, which might
automatically suggest judiciousness. These are people who know what
they're doing,'' Schneider continued.
   Stephen Hess, an analyst with Brookings Institution, agrees, says
``this is unique for a period in which you have divided government''
with one party controlling the White House and another the Congress.
   ``The sort of conciliation these individuals represent is perfect
for this moment. But not necessarily for all times,'' Hess
continued. ``It's not necessarily the best way to create innovation,
or to take the political risks that are sometimes needed.''

<TEXT>
   Adm. William J. Crowe, the senior U.S. military
officer, plans to open an 11-day visit to the Soviet Union by asking
his Soviet counterparts for details of their proposals to cut
conventional forces in Europe.
   Crowe, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters
Tuesday he also expected to sign an agreement in Moscow on
curtailing dangerous military incidents.
   The focus of the trip is likely to be proposals by the East and
West blocs to sharply reduce their troops, tanks and warplanes in
Central Europe. The two sides have recently advanced similar
proposals, but details remain to be spelled out.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his arms-cut proposals,
``has talked about men and he has talked about weapons systems,''
Crowe said in remarks at the Pentagon.
   ``There are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what
that means, and what dismantling means, and what they will do with
those systems, and what systems they are talking about. Those
questions have not all been answered,'' said Crowe, who is scheduled
to arrive in Moscow next Monday. He will tour five of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Crowe said he would ask the Soviets why they recently increased
tank production, despite statements by Gorbachev that defense
spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production by 20
percent over coming years.
   The proposed Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military
Activities, which Crowe said he expected to sign on the first day of
his visit, is designed to prevent such incidents as the shooting
death of Maj. Arthur Nicholson at the hands of Soviet soldiers in
East Germany on March 24, 1985.
   Crowe said the proposed agreement also would address naval
incidents inside territorial waters, such as the bumping of two U.S.
Navy vessels by Soviet ships off the Crimea in the Black Sea on Feb.
12, 1988, and the use of laser range finders that might blind
soldiers or sailors on either side.
   The visit by Crowe, who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs of
the four U.S. military services, follows a tour of the United States
last July by Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, then the Soviet chief of
staff. Akhromeyev has since become an adviser to Gorbachev and has
been replaced as defense minister by Col. Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev.
   The Americans, according to an itinerary handed out at the
briefing, will visit an unidentified Soviet missile facility in the
Ukraine, see a ground exercise in Byelorussia, ride on a Soviet
missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off Murmansk, the
northern Soviet port on the Barents Sea.
   Crowe said he also asked to see a Soviet submarine but had not
received a response.

   A key contractor helping to design the Navy's
Seawolf nuclear attack submarine says development snags could delay
completion of the first vessel.
   The warning, issued last December by the Newport News, Va.,
Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. to the Naval Sea Systems Command,
complained of a lack of progress by the Navy and another contractor,
General Electric Co., in developing the combat system of sensors and
computers needed to operate the new sub's weaponry.
   Newport News Shipbuilding said the delays could mean the Navy may
not get the first completed sub in May 1995 as planned.
   ``Continuing delays in completion of the (combat system) design
or the emergence of significant changes in the design could
seriously impact the lead ship design schedule,'' the company said.
   The Seawolf, or SSN-21, is described by the Navy as the key to
rebuilding the U.S. edge in underwater warfare _ an advantage that
has eroded over the past decade because of espionage scandals and
Soviet efforts to build quieter submarines of their own.
   The report from Newport News Shipbuilding was disclosed Tuesday
by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., in a letter to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney voicing ``strong concern about a high-risk acquisition
strategy being pursued by the Navy in the procurement of the $50
billion-plus SSN-21 Seawolf submarine program.''
   Newport News Shipbuilding holds the contract for designing the
Seawolf's hull and interior layout. The company concluded in its
December report that it could not keep the project on schedule
unless ``the combat system design development (is) brought in line
with the ship design development.''
   ``In essence, the ship design and the combat system design (have
become) out of phase by over a year,'' Newport News said.
   Conyers asked Cheney to review the program and give his view of
whether all operational tests should be completed on the first sub
before a full-scale production go-ahead is given.
   Each Seawolf is now expected to cost more than $1.5 billion.
   ``My concern about this matter has been reinforced by a copy of a
letter which has recently come to my attention indicating strong
concern about the design of the AN-BSY-2 fire control system ...,''
Conyers wrote.
   The congressman said would like the defense secretary to tell him
``when and how will you know whether the problems raised in the
Newport News Naval Shipyard letter will affect the planned delivery
date of the first SSN-21?''
   The Navy on Tuesday declined to discuss the substance of the
Newport News report, saying ``it would not be appropriate to comment
on what will become the substance of a reply'' to Conyers.
   The Navy did say, however, it was confident the combat system
would be delivered on time for the lead Seawolf sub.
   The SSN-21, like the current 688- or Los Angeles-class attack
sub, will be designed primarily to hunt and kill Soviet submarines.
It is supposed to feature greater speed, better sensors and
longer-range weapons than the 688 class.
   The Navy maintains the Seawolf ``is going to represent a major
advance in speed, depth, quieting, weapons capability and
supportability.''

   The commandant of the Marine Corps has ordered
every Marine aviation unit around the world to shut down for two
days of refresher safety training in hopes of reversing a
``devastating trend'' in aircraft accidents.
   Gen. Al Gray, the commandant, wrote in a directive that 45
Marines had died this year in flying accidents and that ``crew
error'' was to blame in each case.
   ``It is time to pause, catch our breath and come to grips with
the devastating trend established this year,'' Gray wrote in his
one-page directive, which was distributed Monday night and obtained
Tuesday by The Associated Press.
   ``Our machines are not letting us down; we are letting ourselves
down.''
   The four-star general said he would leave it to the commanders of
each unit to decide when to schedule the refresher training, but
that it must be ``within the next two weeks.''
   ``Forty-five Marines have perished in seven aircraft mishaps thus
far in 1989. May alone saw 22 Marines and five aircraft lost. When I
examine the information available on the circumstances surrounding
these tragedies, aircrew error predominates and most likely will be
a primary cause in all these mishaps.''
   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a spokesman at Marine Corps headquarters
here, said it was ``most unusual'' for a commandant to order a
complete shutdown of the Marine aviation community.
   ``None of our people can ever recall this happening in the
past,'' said Peck. ``But you can see from the directive how
seriously Gen. Gray takes this.''
   The Marine Corps _ both active and reserve _ operates about 1,200
aircraft of various types, spread among 87 different squadrons.
   The order for refresher safety instruction comes less than six
months after the Marine Corps completed its safest flying year in
history. Indeed, in less than six months, the Marines have exceeded
the entire 1988 total for aviation fatalities by 73 percent.
   During 1988, the corps suffered 11 so-called Class A accidents
involving 12 aircraft and lost 26 people. Forty-five people already
have died this year in Marine aircraft accidents involving seven
aircraft.
   Six of the seven aircraft destroyed so far this year have been
helicopters, several of which were carrying large numbers of Marines
on training maneuvers. The most recent occurred May 30, when a CH-46
transport crashed into the Pacific Ocean after taking off from the
USS Denver off the coast of Okinawa, killing 14.
   Prior to that accident, two CH-46's collided in the air on May 27
near Reno, Nev., killing two Marines. On May 3, five died when a
UH-1 Huey crashed during an exercise in France, and one Marine died
the same day when his AV-8B Harrier jet crashed at Parris Island,
S.C.
   In March, during the annual Team Spirit exercises in South Korea,
four died on March 17 when a CH-46 crashed. And on March 20, 19 died
when a CH-53D crashed.
   The military services rarely discuss the probable cause of fatal
accidents, instead following procedures that call for completion of
a final investigative report.
   Gray's disclosure that all of this year's accidents appear to
have been caused by crew error is thus unusual. It was described by
one Marine source as a disclosure ``that we believe is necessary
under the circumstances.''
   Gray, in his directive, said the real issue was ``the
preservation of our most precious war-fighting asset, our Marines.''
   And that, he added, ``demands that we be ruthlessly honest with
ourselves, ensure strict accountability and rededicate ourselves to
excellence.''

<HEAD>Republican Protest of Gregg Probe is Paralyzing Senate Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, angered by a Democratic-led probe into ambassadorial
nominee Donald Gregg's alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra
affair, are leading a boycott that is paralyzing the panel.
   The boycott of committee meetings is preventing action on two
pending authorization bills providing a total $16 billion
authorization for foreign aid and State Department spending.
   Democrats say they may retaliate by blocking action on all
diplomatic and State Department appointments, including nominations
for key posts the administration wants to fill quickly.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is spurring the Gregg
investigation, told reporters: ``We may not determine anything for
awhile; this committee may not have any hearings on anything,
including Gregg.''
   ``If this committee can't meet on anything else, maybe the
committee also can't meet on Gregg,'' Cranston said.
   Republicans opened the tug-of-war on Tuesday, boycotting a
working session and preventing action on a pending $4.5 billion
authorization bill for the State Department and other agencies. Also
frozen by the standoff was a two-year, $11.5 billion foreign aid
authorization bill.
   The investigation is focusing on Gregg's alleged links to the
Iran-Contra affair while serving as national security adviser for
Vice President Bush.
   The key questions are:
   _Did Gregg help Oliver L. North secretly and illegally resupply
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in 1985?
   _Is he lying about it now?
   On Tuesday, eight Democrats gathered to try to act on the State
Department bill.
   The only Republican present was Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, the panel's ranking GOP member, and he walked out. A
quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the committee to act on
pending legislation or nominations.
   ``It's very apparent that we are unable to do business because
the Republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate
committee inquiry is taking place with respect to Mr. Don Gregg,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Kerry said Republicans in the past have held up certain
nominations for months, yet Democrats continued to permit the
committee to get on with its other work.
   ``I think the process is subjected to a kind of tyranny when ...
there is this wholesale boycotting,'' Kerry said.
   ``I would hope the comity of this institution would not lead to
other important business being held up ...,'' he said.
   Cranston complained that a lack of cooperation from the
administration is delaying final action on Gregg, saying he has had
no response to requests for documents and information relating to
Gregg.
   ``The administration seems to me to be showing some contempt for
the committee in this particular matter,'' Cranston said.
   Helms said the boycott is being organized by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who, Helms said, wants a specific date set for
holding another hearing on Gregg and a specific date for voting on
his nomination.
   ``I don't want any suggestions made that we're holding up
anything,'' Helms said. ``Sen. Cranston is holding up. ... He's got
a vendetta going against Mr. Gregg.''
   ``This is an attempt to dredge up Iran-Contra again'' said Helms.
``I'm having a problem on my side because of their discontent over
what Sen. Cranston is doing. I think Sen. McConnell's indignation is
well justified.''
   At that point, Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., attempted to move
for action on the pending State Department bill.
   Would Helms agree? he asked.
   Helms stood up.
   ``I'll see you later, Mr. Chairman,'' he said, walking from the
room. ``I've got to defend my side.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Divorce Usually Sought by Wife</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wives seek divorces nearly twice as often as
husbands, a government study says.
   The National Center for Health Statistics reported Tuesday that
61.5 percent of divorces acted on in 1986 were fought by the wives.
   Husbands petitioned for 32.6 percent and the rest were sought
jointly, the report said.
   Statistician Barbara Foley Wilson expressed surprise that, in a
time when no-fault divorces are becoming more common, the joint
petitions amounted to only about 6 percent of the cases.
   While the center did not provide an analysis of the reasons for
the difference between men and women in seeking divorces, Wilson
commented that over the years women have traditionally been more
likely to file divorce petitions.
   At one time, she said, it was considered ``gentlemanly'' to allow
the wife to sue for divorce, regardless of which party was at fault
in the dispute.
   Various studies, she added, have showed that it is more often the
woman who becomes dissatisfied with a marriage than the man.
   And the presence of children apparently didn't encourage wives to
remain in unhappy marriages.
   In the breakup of marriages where children were present, wives
filed 65.7 percent of the divorce petitions, while women initiated
56.9 percent of the divorces of childless couples.
   This was the first time the Center for Health Statistics, a
division of the Department of Health and Human Services, has
reported on who initiated divorces.
   The figures were included in its detailed final report on divorce
statistics for 1986, a year that saw 1,178,000 marriages break up in
the country.
   Preliminary reports show that divorces fell to 1,157,000 in 1987
and then climbed to 1,183,000 last year. But the reports for 1987
and 1988 have not been completed in the detail which is included in
the 1986 report.
   While the 1986 report was the first to include figures on who
initiated the proceeding, it did cover the period back to 1975,
indicating that women are becoming somewhat less likely to be the
one filing the papers than in the past.
   In 1975, women filed 67.2 percent of divorce papers, compared
with 29.4 percent for men and the rest filed jointly.
   That was down to 63.4 percent by filed by women in 1980, with men
filing 30.2 percent that year and the balance filed jointly.
   The new study also found that divorces were most likely to occur
early in marriages, with 33.6 percent taking place between the first
and fourth years of wedlock.
   Overall, marriages that ended in divorce lasted an average of 9.6
years, according to the analysis.
   The report found that first marriages lasted an average 10.7
years before divorce, while second marriages ended after an average
of 6.7 years. Third marriages lasted an average 7.2 years.

   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto joked
that her visit to the White House exposed her to something she had
never seen before: a Yale man with charm.
   Both President Bush and the leader of Pakistan made light of
their old school ties during a state dinner in Mrs. Bhutto's honor
Tuesday night.
   Bush, Yale class of 1948, quipped in his toast that Mrs. Bhutto,
a 1973 graduate of Harvard's Radcliffe College, had ``refused my
latest offer. She's not going double or nothing on this year's
Harvard-Yale game.''
   Keeping up the Ivy League banter, Mrs. Bhutto responded: ``Ladies

<HEAD>Police Investigating Columnist for Taking Gun to Capitol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Anderson, the syndicated columnist, is
being investigated for carrying an unloaded gun into the U.S.
Capitol to demonstrate security lapses, congressional authorities
said.
   Anderson displayed the handgun, and a bullet, on May 24 when he
interviewed Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole in the Capitol for a
television special on terrorism, said Dole spokesman Walt Riker.
   Riker said Anderson claimed to have walked through a metal
detector with the 9mm Austrian-made pistol on his way to Dole's
office. He pulled out the gun and handed it to the Kansas Republican
after Dole said in the interview that no place was immune from
terrorists.
   ``We realized afterward that we'd been had, that it was an
on-camera stunt. ... We were taken aback, but as we thought about
it, we realized he may have committed a crime,'' said Riker.
   Dole's aides turned the bullet, which Anderson left behind, over
to Senate Sergeant at Arms Henry Giugni. Giugni said Tuesday that
the bullet and statements about the incident had been turned over to
U.S. Capitol Police and officers from that force were investigating
the incident along with the U.S. attorney's office.
   Anderson the following week broadast tape of the interview and
footage of him walking through a Capitol metal detector.
   A Capitol Police duty officer said no spokesman was available to
discuss the investigation Tuesday night. There was no answer at
Anderson's home.
   In an interview broadcast Tuesday on Washington's WUSA-TV,
Anderson was asked how he would react if he were charged with a
criminal offense.
   ``I would say that the authorities in Washington as usual are
going after the whistleblower rather than the offense,'' he said.
   Riker said the news media in general could be hurt by the
incident.
   ``The ironic thing is, Anderson through this stunt has hurt the
media people who have to go through those entrances every day,'' he
said. ``The legacy of this is the media are going to have a harder
time.''
   Giugni said screening has been tightened up at the building.
   ``Naturally they're looking more carefully at press passes and
such. We normally give a certain courtesy to reporters trying to get
through,'' he said.

   Air turbulence bounced a United Airlines jumbo jet
at 37,000 feet Tuesday, injuring about 30 passengers bound for
Chicago, officials said.
   United Flight 90, a non-stop flight from Los Angeles carrying 232
passengers and 11 crew members, landed at O'Hare International
Airport around 7 p.m. without further incident, said airline
spokesman Joe Hopkins.
   ``We've been told the plane was over Garden City, Kan., when it
encountered clear-air turbulence ... which means the pilot couldn't
see it,'' Hopkins said.
   ``The flight attendants said it lasted less than a minute, but
apparently the turbulence was pretty severe,'' he added.
`Fortunately, the seat-belt light was on at the time.''
   ``It was like being in one of those roller coasters,'' said
passenger Loretta Pasquesi.
   United Flight 90 originated in Manila, Philippines, and in Tokyo
picked up a handful of American tourists fleeing the unrest in
Beijing before continuing to Los Angeles and Chicago, said airline
spokesman Rob Doughty. It was not known if any of those travelers
were among the injured.
   Figures on the number injured varied. Officials at hospitals said
20 victims were brought in, but the Federal Aviation Administration
put the number at 35.
   Ten people were removed from the DC-10 on stretchers, said Fire
Department spokesman Stanley Span.
   Seven of the injured taken to Resurrection Hospital were treated
for head and neck injuries, but none appeared serious, said
spokeswoman Sister Bonaventure.
   ``Most are bumped and bruised,'' she said. ``It appears people
who weren't wearing belts may have hit the ceiling.''
   Other hospitals apparently were not expecting any serious
injuries, said another spokeswoman, Janice Youngwith.

<TEXT>
   Birth control pills pose no increased breast
cancer risk even for women with a family member who developed the
disease.
   That's the finding of a new study of oral contraceptive use among
women who have a family history of breast cancer, one of the major
concerns in the medical community about long-term use of th pill.
   ``These data suggest you don't need to be nearly as concerned as
some people thought previously if you have a very strong family
history (of breast cancer),'' said Dr. Bruce V. Stadel, co-author of
the study and a researcher at the Uniformed Services University of
the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   Stadel said that women whose mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts,
or grandmothers had breast cancer are known to be at higher risk of
developing the disease. As a result, doctors for years have
recommended that women with such a family history not take birth
control pills. The perception, he said, was that oral contraceptives
would aggravate an existing risk.
   But the new study relieves this concern, said Stadel, and shows
``oral contraceptive use does not appreciably alter risk of breast
cancer as far as we have been able to study.''
   The research, published in the journal of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, involved an analysis of data
collected from eight areas of the country by two federal agencies
for what is called the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, or CASH.
   The CASH research examined the medical histories of 4,730 women
with cancer and 4,646 who did not have cancer. From these groups,
the new study analyzed the relative risk of breast cancer among oral
contraceptives users who had a family history of breast cancer in
comparison with those pill takers who had no family history of
breast cancer. The length of time that oral contraceptives were used
also was analyzed.
   ``We looked to see if there was a different effect for women with
a strong family history compared to women with no family history,''
said Stadel. ``We found no adverse effect (from the pill). Our data
suggests that oral contraceptive use does not increase the risk of
breast cancer in women with a family history.''
   Though the research seemed to give definite results, Stadel said
there is a need for confirming studies.
   ``This is the largest study of this issue, but it is one study,''
he said ``In this sort of research, we always like to see the
building over time of a consensus based on more and more data. But
this is certainly a strong piece in that direction.''
   Steven G. Silverberg of the Georgetown University Medical Center,
a medical school professor who has researched any connection between
birth control pills and cancer, said the findings confirm a
continuing sense of confidence in the safety of oral contraceptives.
   ``This is not unexpected,'' he said. ``I would have expected oral
contraceptives to not be associated with increased risks, even for
women with a family history of breast cancer. The birth control
pills now being prescribed shouldn't pose a high risk of breast
cancer at all.''
   Other co-authors of the study were Pamela P. Murray and James J.
Schlesselman of the Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences in Bethesda.

<HEAD>IRS Favors Bill Limiting Penalties Against Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is endorsing a
bill to reduce the number of penalties it can assess against errant
taxpayers.
   The bill, by Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, is aimed at simplifying
and eliminating duplication in the penalties, which number close to
150 in current tax law. The number has risen from just 25 in 1967,
reflecting to some degree Congress' use of penalties to raise
revenue rather than simply to encourage compliance with the tax law.
   More than 26 million penalties totaling nearly $6 billion were
assessed last year.
   ``Penalties should exist for the purpose of encouraging voluntary
compliance,'' Michael J. Murphy, acting IRS commissioner, told
Pickle's House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee Tuesday.
   Murphy suggested the penalty system has been thrown together
helter-skelter. Unless there is some coherent philosophy underlying
the structure, he said, ``it is very difficult for us, as penalty
administrators, to fairly and consistently assert these penalties.''
   Pickle's bill, Murphy said, ``will result in substantial
improvement to the penalty system we have now.''
   Murphy offered proposals for changing some parts of the bill, as
did several others witnesses who testified. Overall, however, the
witnesses apparently agreed with the position of John J. Motley III
of the National Federation of Independent Business, who called the
bill `` a great step toward simplifying and clarifying what tax
penalties exist and when they will be assessed.''
   Under present law, a taxpayer can be hit with two or more
separate penalties for the same violation, such as failing to pay
tax on time. Pickle's bill would eliminate such duplication and
consolidate different penalties for negligence, overvaluation of a
deduction and understatement of income into one uniform penalty for
inaccuracy.
   The bill would boost to $1,000 the current $500 penalty for
filing a frivolous tax return, such as one that claims the income
tax is unconstitutional.
   Pickle proposes to sharply increase the penalty for failure to
file a return on time when the failure is intentional or fraud is
involved. Such action could result in a penalty of 15 percent of the
net amount of tax due per month, up to a maximum of 75 percent.
   The penalty for failing to file an information return with the
IRS _ such as a Form 1099 statement of interest paid by a bank to a
depositor _ would be raised to a level that would depend on when it
was eventually filed. The penalty now is $50 for each failure, with
a maximum of $100,000 a year. The proposed penalty would vary from
$15 ($75,000 maximum) to $50 ($250,000 maximum).

<HEAD>Rules Panel Says Only a Few Bailout Bill Amendments to be Considered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House Rules Committee are
telling colleagues the panel is unlikely to permit the full House to
consider more than a few of the 100-plus proposed amendments to
savings and loan bailout legislation.
   However, it is clear from panel members' comments that the
committee will clear at least one or perhaps a combination of
several of the 10 proposed amendments that would blunt the tougher
capital requirements that the Bush administration says is the
cornerstone of its plan to reform the industry.
   ``There seems to be great sympathy throughout the Congress to do
something with this'' capital rule, said Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.
   The committee, which decides the rules for debate of legislation
in the full House, heard in a 4{-hour session Tuesday from 12 House
members seeking to reshape parts of the S&amp;L bill written in the
Banking, Ways and Means and Judiciary committees.
   Forty-seven members remain on the witness list and the Rules
panel scheduled another session this afternoon and may have to hold
a third on Thursday.
   Panel members conceded that the flood of amendments means there's
little hope of meeting House Speaker Thomas Foley's request to move
the bill to the full House this week. They predicted House action
next week.
   That would set the stage for a conference to reconcile the House
bill with a version passed by the Senate in April and send finished
legislation to President Bush's desk in July.
   Bush administration officials are insisting that the House
require all S&amp;L owners to risk more of their own capital _ $3 for
every $100 in lending _ as a buffer against losses to the government
deposit insurance fund.
   However, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and others are arguing that 732
of the nation's 2,949 S&amp;Ls should keep an accounting break known as
``supervisory goodwill,'' which in some cases allows S&amp;L owners to
operate without risking any of their own money.
   According to Hyde, 241 of the 732 will fail to meet the new
capital requirements unless they keep the goodwill, which regulators
permitted in the early 1980s as an inducement for merging with
failing S&amp;Ls.
   Hyde wants S&amp;Ls to have the right to appeal to regulators to keep
their supervisory goodwill, but critics say that could delay the
imposition of tougher standards for as long as 18 months.
   Reps. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions; John LaFalce, D-N.Y., a
member of the banking panel, and two members of the Rules committee,
Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., and Solomon, are proposing other
accommodations on goodwill, arguing that it's unfair for the
government to renege on previous commitments.
   ``I think it's really a bad day in the history of this country
when we as legislators agree to do away with written agreements the
government has made,'' Quillen said.
   However, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, pleaded with the Rules Committee
to permit consideration of at least one amendment to strengthen
capital requirements even further from the 3 percent standard
favored by the administration. Leach wants S&amp;L owners to hold 4
percent tangible capital within two years and five percent after
five years.
   In addition to the capital standards, the Rules panel was
expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the Ways
and Means Committee to add $50 billion in government borrowing for
the bailout to the federal budget deficit. The administration favors
a mechanism for keeping it out of the budget deficit.

   The Senate is trying to finish crafting a bill
funneling $3.3 billion to veterans, college students and other
groups, with some lawmakers hoping to use the measure to block a
surtax on the elderly.
   Legislators planned their fourth day of debate on the legislation
today, hoping to complete work on a bill that has garnered a slew of
provisions on Capitol Hill since President Bush first sought the
measure in March.
   Discussion was continuing today on an amendment by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., postponing implementation of much of the new
catastrophic care program for the elderly under Medicare, including
a cap on doctors' bills.
   McCain's proposal also would delay for a year the surtax on
people 65 or older that is designed to pay for the program. That
levy can reach a maximum of $800 this year for the wealthiest senior
citizens, and some of them have complained that the tax is excessive.
   ``We're laying an incredible cost on them for coverage they do
not want or need at that cost,'' McCain said.
   But opposition to McCain came even from his own political party.
   ``I think I know where the crux of the problem comes from ... ,''
said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., ranking Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee. ``They all live in Sun City, and they all have
incomes of $30,000 to $40,000 a year.''
   Sun City is a retirement community in Arizona.
   Democrats said the size of the surtax should be reconsidered
instead in future legislation.
   On Wednesday, the Senate rejected 69-29 a proposal by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., allowing the Transportation Department to withhold
aid from communities refusing to let transit projects to companies
doing business with the pro-apartheid government of South Africa.
   Lawmakers also adopted by voice vote an amendment by Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, urging Congress to revamp
a tax law that business considers burdensome.
   That followed a 50-49 defeat for Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., who
instead wanted the Senate to repeal the tax law, which forces
companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to low-paid
workers as they are to executives. For technical reasons, Kasten
would have needed 60 votes to prevail.
   The overall spending bill is designed to provide federal agencies
with enough money to see them through the Sept. 30 end of fiscal
1989.
   It would pump $1.2 billion to veterans programs, $892 million for
Guaranteed Student Loans for college students, and $225 million for
food stamps. It would finance other costs including those for Soviet
refugees moving to this country, last year's forest fires, foster
care, and United Nations peacekeeping efforts.
   The measure also is studded with provisions directing federal
resources at projects important to individual lawmakers.
   Thus, it would prevent a school district in Sumter County, S.C.,
from losing about $700,000 in federal education aid this year it
would otherwise forfeit. The provision was sponsored by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the Appropriations Committee.
   Other clauses would order the Army to spend $50 million this year
on cold weather clothes manufactured in 10 states; provide Puerto
Rican political parties with $1.5 million to conduct a referendum on
the island's future political status; and distribute $6.6 million in
subsidies to airlines that serve small communities in 39 states.
   The House passed a $3.7 billion version of the bill on May 24,
two months after Bush sought legislation totaling $2.2 billion.
   The two chambers will have to agree to a compromise before
sending a bill to the White House for Bush's signature.

   A landmark measure to create a direct tax
on households and businesses to support child care was failing in
early returns Tuesday as cities and child-care advocates nationwide
watched.
   With 27 of 84 precincts reporting, the vote was 3,218 against the
measure to 858 for.
   The measure, which faced an uphill battle to win passage by a
two-thirds majority, would raise $1.8 million a year from residents,
businesses, developers and the city's own coffers to open care
centers at 30 elementary schools.
   The program in this city of 165,000 on the east side of San
Francisco Bay also would help sick kids and subsidize poor parents
for baby-sitting costs.
   ``Cities around the country are looking to the Fremont example to
see whether taxpayers are willing to pay for child care,'' said John
Kyle, director of the Children and Families and Cities Project of
the National League of Cities in Washington.
   ``People in 80 percent of all cities are saying child care is the
most pressing need for children from birth to 9 years old,'' he
said. ``Cities are looking for ways to handle that need, and
resources are the biggest barrier to providing good services.''
   About 100 cities offer some kind of support for child care, Kyle
said. Some simply coordinate programs or offer training; others
spend money through general funds, federal community block grants or
developer fees.
   ``Fremont's measure is the only example I know about of a
dedicated tax for any services having to do with children,'' Kyle
said. ``This is on the forefront of things to come in the future.''
   The measure would impose a $12 annual tax on every homeowner,
with renters exempt, and a 20 percent business tax surcharge. It
would expire in 15 years.
   The vote in Fremont will indicate ``how deep public support is
for child care,'' said Abby Cohen, managing attorney for the Child
Care Law Center in San Francisco.
   ``We all have magnifying glasses and we're watching it very
carefully,'' said Deborah Simon, coordinator of San Jose's office on
child care.
   The National League of Cities, which has 1,400 member cities and
49 state and municipal members representing an additional 14,000
cities, said many cities are watching closely.
   ``Advocacy groups see Fremont as an example of what can be done
to deal with a need that is felt in all cities,'' Kyle said. ``It's
not just something for the rich or poor. Lots of people need it.
This measure will make city governments think about this problem.''

   More proof of the danger is needed before
governments launch programs seeking to correct the ``greenhouse''
warming of the planet, a pair of scientists is cautioning.
   There does seem to have been a warming over the last 100 years,
but too much uncertainty remains about the causes of that change to
justify immediate government action, said Robert Jastrow, former
head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
   The effect of clouds is not well understood, and the small
warming recorded so far could easily be a result of normal climate
variability or changes in the brightness of the sun, explained the
former National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientist.
   ``Current forecasts of the man-made greenhouse effect do not
appear to be sufficiently accurate to be used as a basis for sound
national policy decisions,'' said Jastrow.
   Jastrow made his comments in releasing the study ``Scientific
Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem.'' The report was presented
by Jastrow and Frederick Seitz, a former president of the National
Science Foundation and of Rockefeller University. A third co-author,
William A. Nierenberg of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography,
could not attend the news conference on Tuesday.
   The study was published by the George C. Marshall Institute in
Washington. The institute, funded by foundation grants, conducts
research on public policy issues, said Jastrow.
   In recent years the threat of greenhouse warming has attracted
considerable attention, with some scientists warning that it could
raise the Earth's temperature, changing the climate, turning major
farm areas into dust bowls and melting the polar ice caps, causing a
rise in sea levels.
   The warming would result from increases in gases such as carbon
dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. These gases allow warmth from
the sun to pass through to the earth but block outgoing radiation,
raising the planet's temperature in somewhat the same way a
greenhouse warms its interior.
   James Hansen, Jastrow's successor at Goddard, has been a leader
in this research, warning that the effect may already be observable
in studies indicating the planet is about 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer
now than it was a century ago.
   That conclusion has been widely debated, with various climate
experts differing on the effect of clouds, urban growth and other
factors in changing average temperatures.
   ``We don't believe he has overstated the risks,'' of this
warming, commented Jastrow of Hansen's work.
   But, Jastrow added, ``the one place we part company is the
ability to forecast the next century from what we know now.''
   Jastrow recommended increased research spending to determine the
extent of the danger, if any.
   Research facilities costing $100 million or so could help provide
these answers in three to five years, he said, still plenty of time
to act if it is found that a gloabl warming is, indeed, underway.

<HEAD>Marcos Rushed Into Emergency Surgery</HEAD>

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
underwent emergency surgery Tuesday, but hospital officials declined
to give any immediate details.
   Marcos, who has been listed in very critical condition since May
18, underwent 3{ hours of surgery at St. Francis Medical Center
beginning at 3:30 p.m., said Gemmo Trinidad, a family spokesman.
   ``He's very much alive,'' Trinidad said, ``They didn't tell us
yet what the surgery was for.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said a statement on the operation
would be released soon.
   Marcos, 71, has been suffering from a variety of serious
ailments, including kidney and heart failure, pneumonia and
bacterial infections. He has been unable to breathe on his own and
has been undergoing constant kidney dialysis.
   Marcos, who has lived here since his ouster in a popular revolt
in February 1986, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15.
   On May 23, his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive.
   ``I think if you asked any one of us, we'd all say he has a low
probability of long-term surivival,'' transplant surgeon Dr.
Livingston Wong said then.
   Although the prognosis for Marcos remained poor at the time,
doctors would not rule out the possibility of recovery.
   The former leader's illness has prevented him from traveling to
New York to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered his
homeland of more than $100 million and used the money to buy real
estate and art in the United States.
   His wife, Imelda, who also is charged, last month appealed to
Philippine President Corazon Aquino to allow her husband to die in
his homeland. The request was denied.

<HEAD>OAS Gives Panama Mediators More Time; Panama Blames US for Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States gave a team
of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic
transition in Panama but a top Panamanian official said no solution
is possible so long as his country is ``permanently threatened'' by
the United States.
   OAS foreign ministers met Tuesday night to review the situation
in Panama three weeks after they authorized envoys from Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad to try to work out a democratic ``transfer of
power'' in Panama.
   During almost four hours of debate Tuesday night, there was
little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that
goal. Tuesday was their original target date and their new deadline
under the extension is July 19.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Ritter, told reporters after the
session that his government had no intention of moving toward a
solution so long as the United States maintained economic sanctions
and continually threatened Panama with the use of force.
   ``There can be no normal political process under the current
circumstances in Panama,'' he said.
   The crisis in Panama grew out of the decision by authorities
there to declare national elections null and void three days after
they were held on May 7.
   International observers claimed that the government committed
fraud on a massive scale, depriving opponents of the
military-dominated government of a 3-1 victory at the polls. Some of
the opposition candidates were brutally beaten.
   With the scrapping of the election returns, a crisis of
legitimacy has been created, which the OAS has been attempting to
address. But with the passing of almost a month since the crisis
reached a peak, some of the hemispheric indignation over the
continued rule of Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
has dissipated.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, the U.S. undersecretary of state for
political affairs, said the OAS must take account of charter
provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy
as a guiding hemispheric principle.
   The OAS must show that the charter ``is not mere words,'' he said.
   Eagleburger assailed Noriega and said that the OAS must consider
``further action'' against Panama if progress toward democracy is
not achieved quickly.
   ``Noriega is the problem,'' he said.
   Sept. 1 has become a ``guidepost'' for the OAS mediators because
that is the day on which the Panamanian constitution says a new
president must take office.
   The current president is Manuel Solis Palma, a Noriega ally, but
the United States recognizes the president ousted 15 months ago by
Noriega's supporters in the National Assembly, Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Ritter recounted what he described as the series of abuses
committed by the United States since Delvalle's ouster. These
include the freezing of Panamanian assets abroad and U.S. refusal to
pay Panama ``a single cent'' on operations relating to the Panama
Canal.
   The United States has contributed to the destruction of Panama's
economy, Ritter said.
   He noted that President Bush authorized the dispatch of an
additional 2,000 U.S. combat troops to Panama last month after the
elections and said one consequence is that the ``civilian population
lives in fear'' of U.S. military attack.
   Ritter did not oppose the extension of the OAS mandate. The only
opposition came from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto,
who said no extension was appropriate without the explicit support
of Panama.
   Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended.
   The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline
but the United States and other delegates argued that an open-ended
mission would ease pressure on Noriega.

   Compromise federal housing legislation that
Senate authors hope will promote participation of developers,
community groups and local officials in the creation of new
affordable homes has won the backing of two Northeast governors.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Tuesday the $4.1
billion bipartisan measure ``has all the pieces we need to address
the housing needs of our country.''
   ``It reaches out to the states and local communities. It
recognizes that there is a strong and eager network of people in the
housing community ready and anxious to work with you and the new
administration,'' the Democratic governor told the Senate Banking
subcommittee on housing and urban affairs.
   Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, a Republican representing
the National Governors' Association, also endorsed the measure by
Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to
create affordable housing.
   The Cranston-D'Amato legislation, the product of two years of
negotiations, would require state and local governments to match the
federal funds with 25 percent contributions.

   One in six Americans live in the massive
Boston-Washington urban corridor, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau.
   Data from a new census study reported Tuesday also show that the
corridor contains almost one in four of the Americans who reside in
metropolitan areas.
   The data, for 1987, showed 43.5 million people residing in the
East Coast corridor which includes 25 contiguous metropolitan
statistical areas.
   With a national population of 243,396,000 people as of July 1,
1987, that means about 17 percent of the nation lived in the
megalopolis.
   And the bureau reports that 187,072,000 Americans lived in
metropolitan areas, nearly 23 percent of them in the
Boston-Washington region.
   There are four major clusters within the Boston-Washington
region: New York-Philadelphia, 27.8 million; Boston-Providence,
R.I., 6.2 million; Washington-Baltimore, 6.1 million and

   The Federal Communications Commission says a
Los Angeles television station was not required to tell viewers that
a toy maker was providing a children's program in exchange for
advertising space.
   The commission, in a ruling upholding the common industry
practice of ``barter'' sales, on Tuesday denied a complaint that
KCOP-TV should have identified Mattel Inc. and TV syndicator Group W
Productions as sponsors of the cartoon show, ``He-Man and the
Masters of the Universe.''
   The Los-Angeles based National Association of Better Broadcasting
had characterized the children's fantasy show as a non-stop
depiction of the ``He-Man'' logo and ``He-Man'' toy products made by
Mattel.
   The FCC in 1985 denied the complaint, which had been joined by
Action for Children's Television. NABB appealed to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, which in September 1987 remanded the case to
the commission which denied the complaint again Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   For Filipinos, the bloody attacks on
pro-democracy demonstrators in China have served as a shocking
vision of what could have happened to their own ``People Power''
revolution three years ago.
   Commentators and officials have also taken advantage of the
massacre of hundreds and possibly thousands of Chinese to discredit
Filipino Communists, who have have patterned their 20-year
insurgency on the Chinese ``people's war'' that brought the late Mao
Tse-tung to power 40 years ago.
   Newspaper and broadcast commentators have drawn parallels between
the turmoil in Beijing and the events of February 1986, when
hundreds of thousands of Filipinos poured into the streets to
protect military officers who had mutineed against President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Marcos ordered his troops to suppress the mutiny. But Marcos'
troops refused to fire on civilians who included nuns, priests and
students. On Feb. 25, 1986, Marcos fled Manila for exile in Hawaii.
   The only casualties were three pro-Marcos soldiers slain
defending the government television station against mutineers.
   ``There, but for the grace of God, we might have gone in February
1986, when that glorious buzzword `People Power' was invented,''
wrote columnist Max Soliven in The Philippine Star of the carnage in
Beijing.
   ``In that crucial moment, that crossroads of history, the
(Philippine) Armed Forces chose to side with the people rather than
with our tyrant.''
   In the years since Marcos fled, President Corazon Aquino and
other Filipino leaders have attributed the success of their
``revolution'' to factors ranging from the ``power of the people''
to intercession by the Virgin Mary.
   ``In (1986), we were all praying because we are all Christians,''
said Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, who called civilians into the streets
three years ago. ``To us, a man is indeed very valuable. Even
soldiers loyal to Marcos felt that their obligation is toward their
country.''
   Some Filipino commentators also believe the key was American
diplomatic pressure. After supporting Marcos for years, U.S.
diplomats warned him not to use force and finally offered him safe
haven in Hawaii.
   No foreign government has such leverage with the Chinese.
   Meanwhile, the military has already begun using the events in
Beijing as a propaganda weapon against the underground Communist
Party of the Philippines.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Tuesday that the events in
China prove that Communism is a discredited philosophy.
   In a statement Monday, Cardinal Sin said the savagery in Beijing
should serve as a warning to Filipinos who support the rebels.
   ``Please open your eyes to the reality that Communism can only
make our lives more miserable,'' he said.

   It happens every year at the Supreme Court, a
springtime silly season when rampant rumors reign.
   Because the nation's highest court often waits until late in its
October-June term to issue decisions in the most closely watched
cases, anticipation gets the best of some.
   This year's first rumor bubbled up late last week when pro-choice
and anti-abortion forces were convinced a decision in a key abortion
case would be announced Monday.
   The court is being asked in a Missouri dispute to overturn or
curtail its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion.
   No one could pinpoint the rumor's origin, but news reporters,
lawyers and political activists helped spread it quickly throughout
the capital city.
   The television networks, with live-transmission equipment outside
the court building and correspondents wired for sound, were poised
to break into their mid-morning programming Monday.
   The decision was a no-show.
   Such rumors about the timing of decisions, often assertedly based
on some unnamed knowledgeable source, have an amazing track record.
They are never, ever correct. But, much like a stopped watch, some
day ...

<NOTE>Busy June Ahead</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Including the Missouri abortion case, the court has 51 decisions
to announce before beginning its summer recess. To date since
October, it has issued 85 signed decisions.
   The term's last scheduled day is June 26, but Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist has the option of extending it.
   Under former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger the court term often
stretched into early July, but the Rehnquist court has wrapped up
the last two terms on June 26 and June 29, respectively.

   When Rehnquist appeared at a House committee hearing last month
to support a proposed 30 percent pay raise for all federal judges,
there was some uncertainty among court and congressional officials
about just when a chief justice had last testified before Congress.
Speculation centered on William Howard Taft and Charles Evans Hughes.

the House Judiciary Committee on June 24, 1943, about the high
court's workload.

<NOTE>Rehnquist on Lawyers</NOTE>

   In a recent speech to the Australian Bar Association, the current
chief justice voiced concern about the number of lawyers surrounding
some legal disputes.
   ``Obviously, if a client wishes this sort of massed battalions of
lawyers on his side and is willing to pay for them, presumably no
one else is the worse for it,'' Rehnquist said. ``But I have a sense
that often law firms impose this sort of a regimen upon a client
without it being requested.
   ``There is no question in my mind that (these) developments ...
have driven up the cost of legal services in the United States in
the past 35 years out of proportion to inflation,'' he said.

   News reporters who face tight deadlines on days the court issues
its decisions often _ but not always _ find help in shorter
summaries prepared by a court officer called the reporter of
decisions.
   Here's an excerpt from one such synopsis accompanying a
Bankruptcy Code decision earlier this term:
   ``The pre-Code practice of denying postpetition interest to
holders of noncensensual lines, while allowing it to holders of
consensual lines, was an exception to the exception for oversecured
claims from the rule that the running of interest ceased when a
bankruptcy petition was filed, and was recognized by only a few
courts and often depended on particular circumstances.''

<HEAD>Report: Foreigners Among Leading Political Contributors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented report submitted to
parliament, the government has revealed that many of the major
contributors to Israel's political parties in last year's national
elections were foreigners.
   The report only gave the first initial, last name and sum
contributed for the 20 largest givers, but the list included figures
from the United States, Canada, France and Spain, State Comptroller
Miriam Ben Porat said.
   She would not elaborate on the contributors' identities.
   The report, submitted Tuesday by Mrs. Ben Porat, publicly
revealed for the first time the names of political contributors.
   Israel's two major political parties, the left-leaning Labor
Party and the right-wing Likud, have long opposed any efforts to
disclose the names of large contributors, saying it would inhibit
contributions.
   The report named Charles Bronfman of Canada as the largest single
contributor. He gave $1.3 million to Labor. The second largest
donor, Jean Friedman of France, gave $415,000, also to the Labor
party.
   Although corporate contributions are outlawed, there is no
ceiling on private donations.
   Speaking before the report was formally issued, former Labor
party Secretary-General Uzi Baram said: ``To my knowledge there is
no other example in the world where most of the donations that are
made to political parties don't come from the same nation where the
elections are held.''
   Mrs. Ben Porat said she released the report to prevent large
contributors from trying to influence Israeli politics.
   ``If we know about these contributors and, God forbid, one of
them sees it as an investment, and wants it to be realized, the
public can come and help me so it doesn't happen,'' Mrs. Ben Porat
said.
   The report listed the names of all contributors who donated more
than $31,000 to political parties after August 20. Ms. Ben Porat
first notified parties that the names of contributors would be
published on that date.
   The election was held Nov. 1.
   The report lists 14 contributors who together gave $2.8 million
to Labor and five who together gave $405,000 to the Likud.
   One contributor, from Austria, gave $100,000 to the left-wing
Citizens Rights Movement.
   The report did not include the names of three donators. One gave
$250,000 to the Likud, and two gave a total of $470,000 to Labor.
   Ms. Ben Porat agreed to withhold publication of their names when
leaders from Labor and Likud said they were in sensitive positions
in foreign countries and publication of their names could endanger
their lives.
   The report said Israel's 17 political parties raised a total of
$41.8 million, with Likud and Labor both gathering almost $15
million.

<HEAD>President Moi Orders All Political Detainees Freed: Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel arap Moi has ordered the
country's jails cleared of all inmates detained without trial or
charge.
   Kenya's three English-language newspapers reported the story
Tuesday, saying Moi issued the order at a rally Monday in a farming
community outside the provincial capital of Nakuru, 98 miles north
of Nairobi.
   Moi did not name any of the affected detainees or indicate their
numbers, but the papers identified three as lawyer Mirugi Kariuki,
business executive Israel Otieno Agina and a former Air Force
private, Richard Obuon Guya.
   Kariuki was detained in 1986 during a crackdown of members of
Mwakenya, a clandestine group the government says was plotting Moi's
overthrow.
   Agina and Okwany were arrested last year in a renewed crackdown
on people suspected of links with Mwakenya and two other secret
anti-government groups, the Kenya Revolutionary Movement and the
Kenya Partiotic Front.
   Officials in charge of internal security, which is responsible
for detentions, could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Detainees are held under the Preservation of Public Order and
Safety Act, which permits indefinite detention without trial or
charge.
   On June 1, Moi ordered four political detainees freed _
businessman Raila Odinga, former political science lecturer at the
University of Nairobi Mukaru Ng'ang'a; lawyer Wanyiri Kihoro; and
Samuel Okumu Okwany, who was implicated in the trial of Kenyans who
secretly traveled to Libya for guerrilla training.
   Odinga is the elder son of a former vice president and government
critic, Oginga Odinga. The younger Odinga was first detained in
1982, after an abortive coup attempt by junior air force officers.
He was freed in February 1988 but was detained again six months
later.
   From 1986 under last year, at least 100 people were jailed after
allegedly confessing to ties with clandestine groups. Human rights
groups, including Amnesty International, claimed the confessions
were coerced, a charge the government denied.
   Moi first ordered all political detainees freed in 1978 when he
succeeded the late Jomo Kenyatta, the East African nation's first
president after it gained independence from Britain in 1963.

<HEAD>Amnesty Signed for Return of 41,000 Namibian Guerrillas, Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa has agreed to a general
amnesty that is to allow 41,000 Namibian black nationalist
guerrillas and refugees to return home to the territory from camps
in neighboring Angola and Zambia.
   The move is part of an independence plan for Namibia, which South
Africa has ruled for 74 years in defiance of the United Nations and
a 23-year fight for black majority rule.
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa signed the amnesty Tuesday,
paving the way for the repatriation to begin Monday. Some Namibians
will be coming home for the first time in 20 years.
   U.N. officials said they would be airlifting the Namibian
refugees at a rate of 1,000 to 1,400 a day through July.
   In conjunction with the amnesty, Namibia's South
African-installed administrator repealed security laws, including
those allowing detention without trial and empowering Botha to halt
court proceedings against security force members.
   The repeal is a prelude to pre-independence elections in November.
   Louis Pienaar, Namibia's administrator, and U.N. envoy Martti
Ahtisaari had been negotiating the moves for weeks.
   ``The discriminatory and restrictive laws that are to be repealed
represent only a small fraction of those that have existed in this
territory for many years,'' Ahtisaari said.
   He said all 41,000 Namibians returning from Angola and Zambia
will be covered by the amnesty.
   On Monday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees plans to bring
the first 1,374 refugees to the northern towns of Ondangwa and
Grootfontein and the capital, Windhoek, officials said.
   They will include members of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, Namibia's only guerrilla-backed movement.
   SWAPO is favored to win the November elections, though it is
unclear if the organization will capture the two-thirds majority
needed to control a new government.
   Campaigning is to begin July 1, but senior guerrilla leaders have
not said when they plan to come home.
   U.N. and South African officials still must resolve issues
including voter registration procedures and the release of political
prisoners.
   Namibian authorities say they are holding 29 political prisoners.
The guerrilla movement says 201 dissidents were freed recently.
   More than 4,000 U.N. military personnel are in Namibia to monitor
the transition to independence, and Ahtisaari said he would deploy
500 more police monitors.
   South Africa agreed to the U.N. independence plan in a
three-nation regional accord involving the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops helping Angola's government fight right-wing rebels
armed by Pretoria and Washington.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar announced Tuesday that two black African diplomats have
been appointed as senior staff to strengthen the U.N. Namibian
independence operation.
   African front-line states had lobbied intensely for appointment
of an African assistant to give them a stronger voice in the Namibia
operation.
   Botswana's U.N. ambassador, Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, was named
an assistant secretary-general to serve as deputy special
representative for Namibia.
   B.A. Clark, a former Nigerian ambassador, was the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group's special representative in Luanda to improve
liaison with Angolan authorities.

   Voters decided to close the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant on Tuesday, marking the first time an electorate
has chosen to shut down an operating reactor.
   With absentee ballots in and all precincts reporting, 112,138 or
53.4 percent voted to close the troubled plant, while 97,698 or 46.6
percent voted to keep it open.
   Election officials had projected a heavy special election turnout
of up to 50 percent of the 529,658 registered voters in the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which operates the plant 25
miles southeast of California's capital.
   Voters in the district that includes most of Sacramento County
and parts of Placer County gave the plant a reprieve in June 1988,
but put it on probation until the election this year.
   Though the vote was not binding on the utility district, a
majority of its elected board members said they would follow the
will of the people.

   Rancho Seco critics feared the 15-year-old facility was unsafe
and they were angered by rising utility bills. They also pointed to
a $400 million repair bill after a 1985 accident in which the
reactor was cooled too fast, raising fears of structural damage and
causing a 27-month shutdown.
   Supporters said the 913-megawatt plant's bad days were over since
it had been overhauled and had new management.
   For the past 17 years, opponents of atomic power have tried
unsuccessfully to shut down nuclear power plants by appealing to
voters.
   While nuclear opponents have failed to persuade voters to close
down any existing plants, they have won elections that prevented new
nuclear plants from being built in some states.
   The industry, fearful that closing one of the few publicly owned
nuclear power plants in the nation could strengthen the hand of
critics of privately owned plants elsewhere, raised $580,000 to push
for its continued operation.
   Opponents, which included the Campaign California environmental
group formed by Assemblyman Tom Hayden and his estranged wife, Jane
Fonda, raised $111,000, according to the latest campaign reports.
   Since its restart in April 1988, the plant has been nagged by a
series of mechanical problems that shut it down or forced cutbacks
in power production. Overall, since restart, the plant has run at
about 47 percent of its operating capacity.
   But plant spokesmen Kerry Shearer said the plant had won praise
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for improvements since the
accident and that the restart last year was one of the smoothest in
the industry.
   Greg Cooke, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman, said other
ballot measures aimed at closing or blocking nuclear power plants
all had been voted down. More than a dozen such measures have
appeared on ballots around the country in the last 14 years.
   Last November, voters in Massachusetts turned back a referendum
that would have prohibited the generation of nuclear wastes. The
measure was aimed at forcing the closure of the state's two nuclear
plants.

   Striking miners marching through West
Virginia this week are self-consciously following the path of the
United Mine Workers in its bloody fight to unionize the Appalachian
coal fields 70 years ago.
   ``It's the same struggle,'' said David Whitman, a delegate in the
state Legislature and UMW member who was among 60 miners marching
Tuesday. ``We're not facing rifles, but they're using the courts and
economics on us.''
   Since early April, the UMW has been battling Pittston Coal Group
Inc. in Virginia and West Virginia. More than 2,000 miners and their
wives have been arrested for civil disobedience and the union has
been fined millions of dollars.
   In 1921, the union faced the rifles of federal troops in the
bloody five-day Battle of Blair Mountain, where 50 marchers were
camped out Tuesday night.
   The union lost the original fight, but retrenched and later won
the right to organize workers in southern West Virginia during the
Great Depression.
   ``They lost the battle, but they won the war,'' said Terry
Collins, a Pittston employee for eight years before the strike.
   The strikers this week were marching 85 miles north to
Charleston, where they will be joined at a rally by machinists
hoping to call attention to their strike against Eastern Airlines.
Jesse Jackson is the featured speaker at the rally. Gov. Gaston
Caperton, a Democrat who won election last year with union support,
has not said whether he will attend.
   ``We're going to Charleston to see what side of the fence the
governor's on,'' said marcher John Tomblin, 35.
   About 1,500 Pittston workers walked out April 5 after working 14
months without a contract. More than 100 miners with the New Beckley
Coal Co. also have been off their jobs since January in a related
dispute.
   Pittston miners claim the company, which refused to go along with
an industrywide UMW agreement and has kept its mines open with
non-union labor, is trying to break the union by reducing job
security and setting up an independent pension fund.
   Pittston officials say they want to maintain a union shop, but
with more flexible work rules permitting greater subcontracting and
seven-day work weeks, to meet growing competition from non-union and
foreign companies.
   Both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect contract
   negotiations throughout the coal industry.
   Miners started their march Tuesday with a 10-mile trek from Logan
to the summit of Blair Mountain. The route was lined with large
signs proclaiming ``We Support the U.M.W.A.''
   The marchers said they were carrying on the work of the miners
who faced federal troops 68 years ago after marching from Marmet
south to the mountain. This year's march reverses that path.
   ``They passed this way to win what they got. So we're passing
this way to keep what we've got,'' Tomblin said.
   The Battle of Blair Mountain had its start in the southern West
Virginia coal fields during the early 1900s, when miners rebelled
against industry policies that kept them in check with company-owned
stores and housing, and oppressive, unsafe work conditions.
   The conflict led to the ``Matewan Massacre'' on May 19, 1920, in
which 10 people were killed, including seven coal company detectives
and Matewan's mayor. The next year, Mingo County Sheriff Sid
Hatfield, a defender of the union, was shot and killed at the
McDowell County Courthouse where he was standing trial for murder in
connection with the Matewan shootout.
   Upon news of Hatfield's death, miners marched to the mountain and
were confronted by federal troops called in from Kentucky and
Virginia. In the ensuing battle three union men died and 40 men from
both sides were wounded.
   The union says it is committed to non-violent methods today, but
equally committed to beating Pittston.
   ``We've got all the berries in one basket,'' Collins said.
``We're not planning on losing.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation Of Rocky Flats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of federal agents seized records at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant as the government announced a
criminal investigation of possible environmental violations at the
facility.
   Investigators were checking allegations that employees treated,
stored and disposed of hazardous wastes without permits, falsely
certified federal environmental reports and concealed environmental
contamination, said U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver.
   Norton said 75 agents from the FBI and the Environmental
Protection Agency's office of criminal investigations began
searching the plant Tuesday morning. The probe is expected to last
six months to a year.
   Federal officials declined to say what prompted the search at the
plant, identified last year by the Department of Energy as the most
environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry
because of contamination of an underground reservoir.
   Officials stressed that no new dangers existed at the plant,
which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   ``It is absolutely essential that the public understand that this
investigation does not signal any major new environmental safety or
health concern,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a
statement issued in Washington.
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., whose district encompasses Rocky
Flats, said the implications of the swarm of investigators at the
plant ``is the Department of Justice had some reason to believe they
would be risking destruction of evidence if they didn't act in that
fashion.''
   He told The Associated Press he has heard ``there were several
informants that became the basis for the FBI-Department of Justice
investigation and that's been going on for the better part of a
year.''
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver is operated for the DOE by
Rockwell International Corp.
   Investigators are examining actions by both government and
Rockwell employees, The New York Times reported.
   A spokesman for Rockwell said the company had advised employees
to cooperate with investigators but declined to comment further.
   Rocky Flats has been dogged by environmental problems. DOE
inspectors closed the plant's main plutonium reprocessing building
last October for four months because of safety violations. The DOE
also issued a report last December that revealed 32 new safety
problems.
   Thornburgh said he authorized disclosure of the investigation
because the search was a matter of public record.
   Skaggs, a staunch critic of Rocky Flats' operations, said there
was apparent ``reason to believe a number of individuals at the
plant were involved in concert in the effort to falsify and mislead
with regard to environmental compliance issues.''
   Energy Secretary Admiral James D. Watkins, in a statement, said
his department will perform an independent analysis of Rocky Flats
operations ``and ensure that continued operations, regardless of
past practices, are conducted in a safe and environmentally sound
manner.''
   He also said part of the plant would be shut down as a result of
the investigation, but he offered no specifics in the statement.
   Watkins said he was suspending ``those operations for which
safety could be adversely affected by the presence and functioning
of the Department of Justice investigating team.''
   Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat who has prodded federal officials to
deal with Rocky Flats' radioactive waste disposal problems, was
informed of the investigation only an hour before it was announced.
Romer said he was assured he would be notified immediately of any
new dangers.
   ``I'm outraged by the possibility that some criminal action may
have occurred at Rocky Flats,'' Romer told a news conference shortly
after the federal announcement.
   ``I have been trying to say to people this is an operation that
we're monitoring closely and it's not endangering your health. Today
I have to say to people, `Wait a minute. I don't know yet,''' Romer
said.
   The investigation involves alleged violations of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act and the federal
false statement law, Norton said.

   Here are sketches of China's top leaders:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DENG XIAOPING, 84, who ordered troops to march on the capital to
suppress pro-democracy unrest, is the most powerful leader in China
even though the highest ranking position he holds is chairman of the
Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party. The
commission, not the Defense Ministry, has the final say on military
matters.
   Deng was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and then staged a comeback that transformed China from a
country dominated by ideological battles into one with pragmatic,
market-oriented economic policies. Living standards have improved
for millions of Chinese but the modernization drive has led to
serious problems of inflation and corruption.
   Deng has been out of sight since May 16. Chinese sources say he
has been hospitalized for treatment of prostate cancer. The
government denied a report Tuesday that Deng had died, calling it a
``fabrication designed to make people uneasy and create chaos.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ZHAO ZIYANG, 69, reportedly purged for sympathizing with the
students, was general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since
1987 and had been the nation's leading advocate of rapid economic
reforms.
   As governor of Sichuan province in the late 1970's, he led the
country in successful experiments in restoring family farming.
   In 1980, Deng brought him to Beijing and he was quickly named
premier. He became party chief in 1987 following the ouster of
fellow reformist Hu Yaobang, who was blamed for student unrest.
   Zhao was last seen on May 19 when he went to Tiananmen Square to
meet student hunger strikers. He is said to be under house arrest.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LI PENG, 60, who declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, has
been premier since April 1988. Li studied in the Soviet Union in the
1950's and represents the technocrats now filling many government
offices.
   He opposed Zhao's moves in market-oriented reforms, saying he
supports the plan but prefers a more cautious pace.
   One Hong Kong newspaper reported that Li was shot Sunday by a
police officer in the Great Hall of the People and wounded in the
thigh. It said Li was not seriously injured and the officer was
immediately shot to death.
   Li has not been seen in public since he met three new ambassadors
May 25 and said the government was ``stable.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   YANG SHANGKUN, 82, who supported Li's declaration of martial law
and led the hardliners demanding a tough stand against the students,
became China's president, or head of state, in April 1988.
   The post of president is largely ceremonial but Yang has close
ties to Deng and holds a seat on the 17-member party Politburo.
   A career military man who was active in Red Army campaigns in the
1930's and 1940's, Yang was appointed permanent vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission in 1982. Yang's power in that post
reportedly has grown and some say he has been running the commission.
   More important, Yang is widely believed to have family
connections within the hierarchy of the armed forces, particularly
the 27th Army that marched on the city last weekend.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   QIN JIWEI, the defense minister may have been ousted from office
for opposing martial law. Qin is the former head of Beijing Military
Region, which was said to be unenthusiastic about martial law.
   Qin has links with the 38th Army from the Beijing region that may
have refused orders to move against the students.

<HEAD>Stocks Soar, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stock prices rose sharply in Tokyo today, while the
dollar edged up against the Japanese yen amid uncertainties over
turmoil in China, dealers said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which slipped 5.07 points Tuesday, rose 174.88 points, or 0.52
percent, closing at 33,626.89. The index had fallen four straight
days since Thursday.
   The dollar ended trading at 142.80 yen, up 0.17 yen from
Tuesday's 142.63-yen finish. After opening at 142.45 yen, the
currency ranged between 142.40 and 143.00 yen.
   Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the unstable Chinese situation encouraged dollar buying,
but speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board might cut
interest rates also gave participants a reason to sell the U.S.
currency.
   ``We had a lot of dollar buying because many investors believe
the U.S. money is a safe investment in time of emergencies,'' he
said. ``But they didn't want to hold too many dollars either because
of expectations the Fed might cut its interest rates soon.''
   Investors speculate the Federal Reserve may ease its monetary
policy following the cut in the prime lending rate on Monday by
major U.S. banks.
   Kanai said there were unconfirmed rumors that the Bank of Japan
intervened in the market to support the yen when the dollar hit the
143-yen mark. ``It had no impact on the market,'' he said.
   The central bank usually does not comment officially on its
market interventions.
   On the stock market, dealers said the Nikkei index began to rise
as investors picked up cheap issues following the four days of
losses.
   But trading was basically directionless because of uncertainties
over political unrest in China, which made many institutional
investors remain on the sidelines, said a trader with a major
securities firm.
   Speculative buying pushed up the index, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Trading was moderate, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 600 million shares, up from Tuesday's 550 million
shares. Among the winners were steel and construction issues.

   There's no periscope and there is water
inside, but a two-man submarine built by students is MIT's bet to
crack the eight-minute kilometer and win the First International
Submarine Race.
   After months of planning and production, the cigar-shaped Icarus
was launched Tuesday on its first voyage _ in the Alumni Pool of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   They didn't go very fast: swimmers lapped them.
   Cliff Goudey, MIT Sea Grant College Program project director,
said the $5,000 top prize was a major incentive to enter the
one-kilometer race off Florida later this month.
   ``When the prize was announced, the idea of winning, combined
with the reputation MIT has in doing well in these kinds of things,
was motivation enough to get us involved,'' Goudey said. ``We all
want to be heroes.''
   The two-person submarine's trial run didn't get off to a flying
start.
   Students in the project _ Evan Mead, Al Cangahuala, and Anthony
Joseph, all 23; Patrick Nee, 22; and Russell Cohn, 18 _ added and
removed small floats to the submarine to balance it under water. The
craft's nose was too light, then too heavy, then too light.
   After about 30 minutes of tinkering, the crew began slowly
propelling the Icarus back and forth with Mead providing the legwork
for the pedal-powered craft.
   Swimmers on the other side of the pool easily lapped the
submarine during its first efforts. But as navigator Cangahuala and
Mead hit their stride, the Icarus began picked up speed.
   The three-day race, beginning June 23 off West Palm Beach, is
sponsored by the H.A. Perry Foundation, a non-profit scientific
foundation created to inspire development of undersea technology
through education, research and experimentation.
   The MIT entry will be up against 18 other submarines from 16
colleges or engineering firms.
   Mead said the MIT crew will use ``ringers,'' or athletes, to
pedal the submarine. The subs are ``wet,'' or water-filled, meaning
the pilot and first mate will have to wear SCUBA equipment.
   If Greek mythology has anything to do with it, the MIT entry
could be the favorite to win the competition. According to legend,
Icarus and his father, Daedalus, attempted human-powered flight.
While Daedalus stayed aloft, Icarus plunged into the sea.

   Turmoil in China provoked protests worldwide against
the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing,
while economic fallout from the crisis was building throughout Asia.
   The unrest that left hundreds and perhaps thousands of people
dead has seriously damaged the goodwill and trust once extended the
Communist nation.
   France, Holland and Sweden have barred diplomatic contacts with
officials in China, while the United States, Britain and Switzerland
banned military sales to Beijing.
   China's Foreign Ministry today rebuked the United States for
trying to exert pressure on China over what it said was a ``purely
internal affair.''
   Washington sells China more than $600 million of military
equipment a year, and private U.S. dealers sell another $85 million.
Officials would not provide Britain's military sales to China but
Independent Television set the amount at $4.7 million a year.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed ``utter revulsion'' at
the Chinese crackdown and said, ``We will be thinking how best to
demonstrate that in practical ways.''
   The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li Qin
Ping and told him the Netherlands ``is exceptionally shocked by the
violent and brutal actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.''
   The 12-nation European Economic Community strongly condemned the
Chinese action and appealed to authorities to stop using force.
   In Moscow, members of the Congress of People's Deputies called on
China's leaders to use ``wisdom, reason and a weighted approach''
but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry made
no comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fences after
decades of estrangement.
   Achille Occhetto, head of Italy's Communist Party, urged the
Kremlin to take a strong stance against the massacre and distanced
his party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. Italy has
the largest communist party in the West.
   Meanwhile, Chinese students and others staged protests outside
Chinese embassies in Seoul, Stockholm, Madrid, Abu Dhabi, Belgrade,
the Hague, Athens and other cities.
   In Hong Kong, authorities used tear gas to disperse 4,000 people
in the twin city of Kowloon who tried to break into Chinese banks in
the area and hurled stones and bottles at police this morning.
   Singaporeans joined a movement started earlier in the week in
Hong Kong to withdraw $32 million in deposits from Chinese banks out
of fear and to protest the bloodshed in Beijing, bank officials said.
   Wewe Cho Yao, president of a Singapore Chinese group, the Chinese
Clan Associations, said the killings in China had shaken the
confidence of foreign investors.
   About 76 percent of the 2.6 million people in Singapore are
ethnic Chinese.
   In Hong Kong, wreaths were placed outside China's Xinhua News
Agency office in memory of those who died in Beijing, and some
people wore black armbands.
   Authorities in Taiwan lifted a ban on telephone links to the
Chinese mainland to encourage private contacts between people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits and to help break a news blackout
inside China, Communications Minister Chang Chien-pang said.
   The links will be through Hong Kong and will be operable within
three days, he said.
   The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war in China to
the Communists in 1949, has lifted restrictions on visits to the
mainland the past two years, although it continues to ban official
contacts.
   The Broadcasting Corporation of China, Taiwan's state radio
station, kicked off a 24-hour news broadcast to China on shortwave
channels with a hotline accepting telephone calls from Chinese
listeners.
   About 20 leaders of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
began a 15-day hunger strike to mourn the deaths in China, while in
the central city of Miaoli, about 74 miles southwest of Taipei,
10,000 people rallied in protest.
   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, in remarks to Parliament,
said ``leveling guns at the people is a grave matter.''
   Japanese Vice Minister Ryohei Murata summoned Chinese Ambassador
Yang Zhenya, and told him the situation in China was ``very
regrettable,'' but Tokyo continued to view it as an ``internal
affair,'' a ministry official said.
   Negotiations on a $120 million loan for an oil project and
another $250 million loan through the Asian Development Bank were
cut off, said Teruo Takada, spokesman for the Federation of Bankers
Associations of Japan.
   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China and the
assistance, most in the form of loans, has totaled more than $6.1
billion during the 1980s.
   Many governments have advised their citizens in China to leave
the country as reports spread of Chinese soldiers battling each
other in Beijing. Some, including Britain and Australia, have
ordered the evacuation of non-essential diplomatic personnel and
dependents.
   The U.S. State Department urged the 1,440 Americans in Beijing to
leave and made arrangements for U.S. airlines to fly them to safety.
   Special flights also were arranged for Canadians, Australians,
New Zealanders, Swiss and Hong Kong residents, among others.

   A Democratic congressman seeking to avenge a
narrow defeat eight years ago and a Republican who vanquished seven
rivals in the primary won the right to battle for governor.
   Democrats on Tuesday overwhelmingly nominated Rep. James Florio,
while his congressional colleague James Courter won the GOP
nomination in a far closer race.
   Elsewhere, voters for the first time decided to shut down an
operating nuclear power plant. A measure that would have kept open
the troubled Rancho Seco plant in Sacramento, Calif., was rejected
by 53.4 percent to 46.6 percent.
   The vote was not binding on the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, but the plant operators said they would begin shutting
down the plant today.
   Looming budget problems, soaring auto insurance rates and high
property taxes promise to dominate campaigning for New Jersey's Nov.
7 gubernatorial election.
   Florio is making his third try at the governor's office. He lost
to Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean in 1981 by a heartbreaking 1,797
votes out of 2.3 million cast. Florio ran third in the 1977
Democratic primary.
   Courter emerged from a tight four-way primary battle to score a
surprisingly decisive victory, winning by nearly 27,000 votes.
   The State Republican Committee already has targeted Florio with
statewide mailings of news clippings that describe his role as a
political powerbroker in his district in Camden, across the state
line from Philadelphia.
   Courter said he is optimistic and wasted no time in jabbing at
his opponent's longtime ambitions.
   ``Jim Florio has been running for governor nearly 14 years now,''
Courter said.
   Florio said he did not care which Republican won Tuesday.
   ``I am looking forward to taking charge of an out-of-control
state government. We need someone who knows the answer is not new
taxes, but the courage and willingness to make hard decisions. ...
We will ease the crushing burden of outrageous property taxes on the
citizens of this state,'' he said.
   Since losing to Kean, Florio has carefully built solid support
among Democrats and has softened his image. He was perceived as
brusque and aloof in the 1981 race.
   Florio and Courter ran on anti-tax platforms and attacked the
rapid growth of the state budget, which doubled during the Kean
administration.
   In Washington, Courter supported President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative and distinguished himself on the Armed Services
Committee, while Florio gained a national reputation as a fighter
for the environment and author of the Superfund cleanup law.
   In the GOP primary, Courter was attacked by one opponent for his
dismal attendance record in Congress this year, and most of his
Republican foes charged he knows little about state issues.
   Former Attorney General Cary Edwards, Assembly Speaker Chuck
Hardwick and state Sen. William Gormley were in a close battle for
second place. Sen. Gerald Cardinale ran a distant fifth, while three
other Republicans shared about 3 percent of the vote.
   With 5,817 of 5,845 precincts, or 99 percent, reporting, Courter
had 110,852 votes, or 29 percent; Edwards had 84,124 votes, or 22
percent; Hardwick had 81,193 votes, or 21 percent; Gormley had
65,684 votes, or 17 percent, and Cardinale had 32,159 votes, or 8
percent.
   Florio beat his challengers in all 21 counties, scoring the most
decisive Democratic primary win since 1965. He maintained a low
profile during the campaign against Princeton Mayor Barbara Sigmund
and Assemblyman Alan Karcher.
   With 5,818 of 5,845 precincts reporting, or 99 percent, Florio
had 248,059 votes, or 68 percent; Sigmund had 60,470 votes, or 17
percent; and, Karcher had 55,929 votes, or 15 percent.
   Kean by law was not allowed to seek a third consecutive four-year
term.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
said to be resting comfortably after emergency surgery for an
abdominal infection, but his prognosis for recovery remains poor, a
hospital spokesman said.
   During Tuesday's three-hour operation at St. Francis Medical
Center, surgeons drained a pancreatic abscess, the suspected source
of the persistent infection, said Eugene Tiwanak, the hospital's
assistant administrator.
   Following surgery, Marcos, 71, remained in very critical
condition as he has been since May 18 when he was readmitted to the
intensive care unit with a variety of serious ailments, Tiwanak said.
   An infection had plagued Marcos for the past few weeks. Doctors
believed it was centered in his abdomen but were not sure of its
exact location, Tiwanak said.
   ``They felt his condition was worsening and they needed to do the
exploratory surgery,'' he said, adding they were not certain if
there are other sources of infection.
   Doctors hoped to see some improvement in his condition today, he
said.
   Marcos agreed to the surgery after doctors explained that tests
indicated an infection, said Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza.
   ``They did it cautiously. They went through several X-rays and
several scans first,'' Aruiza said. ``The surgery was a good call.''
   Joe Lazo, an ardent supporter, said he saw Marcos after the
surgery, and saw him ``resting comfortably. He is sleeping, but he
looks good.''
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, was at his bedside Tuesday night, Lazo said.
   Marcos, who was hospitalized Jan. 15, has been suffering from
kidney and heart failure, pneumonia and bacterial infections and has
been undergoing kidney dialysis. He breathes with the aid of a
respirator.
   On May 23, his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive.
   Marcos has lived in Honolulu since his ouster from the
Philippines in a popular revolt in February 1986.
   His illness has prevented him from traveling to New York to face
racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than
$100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the
United States.
   Mrs. Marcos, who also is charged, last month appealed to
Philippine President Corazon Aquino to allow her husband to die in
his homeland. The request was denied.

<HEAD>Three Soviets Among Finalists In Piano Competition</HEAD>

   A Soviet pianist whose father competed
against Van Cliburn 31 years ago was among six finalists chosen in
the Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.
   Alexander Shtarkman's father, Naum, finished third behind the
victorious Cliburn in the 1958 International Tchaikovsky Competition
in Moscow, a contest that rocketed Cliburn to fame.
   Two other Soviet finalists were Elisso Bokvadze and Aleksei
Sultanov, who at 19 was the youngest finalist and the sentimental
choice of the audience.
   Other finalists, out of a field of 38 that began competing May
27, were Jose Carlos Cocarelli of Brazil, Benedetto Lupo of Italy
and Ying Tian of China.
   The quadrennial competition was launched in Cliburn's hometown in
1962 and has become one of the world's most prestigious piano
contests.
   Each of the finalists will perform two piano concertos with the
Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. The medalist will be chosen Sunday.
   Besides launching a career, first place means a gold medal,
$15,000, a Carnegie Hall debut recital concert, concert tours and
free air travel.
   The finalists were announced at 1:15 a.m., about 2{ hours after
Lupo, the last of 12 semifinalists to play, finished Rachmaninoff's
Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor.
   Sultanov, a Moscow State University student, had brought more
than half the audience to its feet Saturday with a rousing finale of
Chopin's Sonata No. 3 in B minor.
   ``I identify in my own mind so with each one of these young
artists that has come for the competition, because the common bond
that we each have is that we all started playing the piano when we
were very, very small,'' said Cliburn, who is 54.
   Judges chose the 12 semifinalists from a field of 38 representing
19 countries. Kevin Kenner, 26, of Coronado, Calif., was the only
U.S. semifinalist. He studies at the Peabody Conservatory in
Baltimore.
   The other semifinalists were Jean-Efflam Bavouzet of France;
Angela Cheng of Canada; Lin Hai of China; Kayo Miki of Japan; and
Pedro Burmester of Portugal.

   The ducks have been dumped and
their supporters are crying foul.
   The few Muscovy ducks that have survived a 17-month-old feud over
their presence in this north Florida coastal community were exiled
by commissioners at a late-night session Monday unattended by most
pro-duck forces.
   On a 3-2 vote, the city commission banished the half dozen
remaining Muscovies and disbanded a committee that had been formed
to resolve the dispute.
   No destination or departure date has been decided for the ducks,
which once numbered near 150 but dwindled after some residents
complained the large fowls defecated profusely and harassed other
animals.
   The duck debate became a cause celebre in January 1988, when the
commission voted to reduce the Muscovy population from 150 to 20.
The ducks were caught and taken to farms or residences outside the
city and eggs were destroyed.
   In late August, a Muscovy swooped down and attacked a city
commissioner and his family.
   In December, pro-duckers accused anti-duckers of running over the
birds with their cars. One duck was found with its legs chopped off.
   Commissioner Tom Wilson didn't present his resolution to oust the
Muscovies until shortly before midnight Monday because the
commission had a two-hour public hearing on a new veterinary clinic.
   ``The ducks have to go,'' said Wilson.
   ``Loud mouths and money have talked against the ducks, and we
can't match that,'' said Jim Vanairsdale, the only pro-duck
committee member to witness the vote. ``I'm really taken aback.''
   ``Some people are mad as hell about it,'' said Commissioner Pete
Dodson, who also backed the birds.

<TEXT>
   People in more than a dozen provincial cities have
taken to the streets to protest the military massacre in Beijing,
blocking major roads and railways with barricades in anticipation of
military assaults.
   Six people were killed when they run over by a train while
manning a barricade in Shanghai and tens of thousands set up
roadblocks in Xian.
   A Chinese source in Shanghai said besides the six dead, six other
people were injured Tuesday night when a train, unable to stop,
struck them as they were gathered by a barricade on tracks near
Shanghai station.
   Shanghai Radio said angry crowds set fire to the train engine and
21 railway security officials were beaten and injured by crowds who
tried to prevent them from putting out the blaze.
   A Scottish student in the ancient capital of Xian said huge
crowds were holding anti-government demonstrations today in front of
city offices.
   He said barricades had been set up on roads leading to city as
rumors spread the military would be called in.
   Official Xian Radio claimed crowds had ``wrecked communications
facilities, blocked buses, trolleybuses and cars, and forced passing
vehicles to halt.''
   It said the demonstrations had ``seriously wrecked the city's
life.'' The Scottish student, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he had seen no evidence of violence or looting.
   He said foreigners in the city were planning to leave for Canton,
which also has had demonstrations, although smaller in scale.
   Radio broadcasts from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province,
said ``a handful of thugs'' on Tuesday continued to ``smash cars,
loot shops, rob pedestrians and throw petrol bombs at bookshops.''
   On Sunday ``a number of scoundrels'' stormed offices of the city
legislature, beating up 300 security officials and police, the
broadcasts said, adding that about 100 people were arrested and one
was shot and wounded.
   The report did not mention unconfirmed reports that 20 people
were killed in the rioting.
   Crowds continued to erect street barricades in Shanghai and the
northeastern city of Changchun.
   ``If this situation continues, the city's economy will be
paralyzed,'' the local radio quoted Changchun Mayor Shang Zhenling
as saying.
   In Shanghai there were small funeral marches for the thousands of
people killed and wounded when troops stormed Beijing to drive
pro-democracy students from Tiananmen Square.
   An American student in the port of Tianjin said the city was
disrupted by demonstrations and foreign students were trying to make
their way out.
   Large demonstrations were also reported in Nanjing, Harbin and
the southern city of Changsha, a hotbed of protests since the
pro-democracy movement began nearly eight weeks ago.

   The turmoil in China has turned what had been an
increasingly popular destination for U.S. travelers into a canceled
trip for many vacationers.
   The bloody upheaval has prompted U.S. tour operators to cancel
vacation packages to China and compelled airlines specializing in
the Pacific region to re-evaluate their service to Chinese cities on
a daily basis.
   A number of operators, including American Express Co., said
Tuesday they had decided to scrub tours to China. Tourism had been
one of China's fastest-growing industries before the military
crackdown in Beijing on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``We're looking at it on a day-by-day basis,'' said Lythia
Rousseas, a marketing associate for Pacific Delight Tours in New
York, considered the largest U.S. tour operator specializing in
China and the Far East.
   Customers have been promised full refunds, but may experience
delays in claiming them from smaller tour operators, travel experts
warned.
   Travel companies continuing normal operations, such as United
Airlines, are closely watching developments in China. ``We're
continuing to monitor the situation,'' said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman
for United at its Chicago headquarters.
   The airline is operating a normal schedule of three flights a
week between Tokyo and Beijing, he said. ``The flight yesterday had
a very light load going in (to Beijing) _ just five people. We had
307 going out.''
   United has adjusted the schedule to minimize risks. The planes
now arrive at Beijing in daylight, stay about an hour and leave;
previously, they had an overnight layover.
   Japan Air Lines has doubled its Tokyo-Beijing schedule by adding
three flights a week, according to Morris Simoncelli, a spokesman
for the carrier in New York. The flights out of Beijing are fully
booked through Saturday, he said.
   The State Department issued a new travel advisory Monday, warning
Americans not to visit China and for those in Beijing to stay
indoors. The department also urged caution in other Chinese cities.
   On Tuesday, the Bush administration urged the 1,440 Americans in
Beijing to get out, and said it was considering using chartered
aircraft to evacuate Americans from the capital and other areas of
the country.
   American Express said its four tour groups currently in China _
about 80 travelers in all _ have been told to cut their visits short
and leave the country immediately, said Marcos Rada, a company
spokesman in New York.

   Sixty-nine years after women won the right to
vote, they are on their way to winning potty parity, thanks to
lawmakers in the state's Senate.
   The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that
requires buildings constructed after June 1, 1990, to have the same
number of toilets for women as men.
   That's to correct an age-old inequity when it comes to bathrooms,
according to the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Guy Velella.
   Current New York state law allows men to have more toilets than
women, and that's a ``gender-based inconvenience'' and a potential
health hazard, Velella said.
   Besides, women take longer than men, so they should have at least
as many stalls in public restrooms, Velella said.
   The bill passed 40-1. Velella's bill probably won't make it into
law this year. As of Tuesday, there was no similar bill in the
Assembly.

   Brotherhood Winery, the oldest
continuously operated winery in the United States, has added a new
twist in winemaking _ ginseng.
   A shipment of about 35,000 cases of what is called the first wine
made from New York grapes and the famed Oriental root was to be sent
to Taiwan today, Brotherhood's master winemaker Cesar Baeza said
Tuesday.
   Baeza said Sonny Lee, a Korean businessman who moved to New York,
asked him what could be done with ginseng, touted for its
restorative and aphrodisiac powers.
   Baeza, who began working at the 150-year-old winery two years
ago, already had experimented with ginseng during his 10 years as a
researcher for Pepsico Inc.'s wine and spirits division.
   The wine Baeza developed is being marketed in the United States
under the name Genghis Khan and comes in two brands, Red Label, with
12 percent alcohol content, and Black Label, with 18 percent
alcohol. He and Lee are partners.
   The wine is marketed in Taiwan under Brotherhood's brand name,
Baeza said. It also was made available to American retailers early
in May, he said.
   ``It's a good combination of a very Oriental flavor and aroma
with a very characteristic New York taste,'' Baeza said.

including representatives from Newark, Mich., a town that no longer

   The three-day event begins Thursday night in Newark, N.J.,
population 330,000.
   Newark, Mich., which has no inhabitants, once consisted of one
block. The community in northwest Oakland County was incorporated
into Holly Township, township Treasurer Bernice Alexander said
Tuesday.
   ``Carl and Gladys McArthur researched that and were invited to
Newark, New Jersey,'' Ms. Alexander said, adding: ``There is no
Newark, Michigan. The old-timers know it as Newark, but there's no
street, no nothing.''
   State mapmakers, however, said the spot still exists.
   ``It's on our map, we're just looking at it,'' said Department of
Transportation spokesman Tom Shawver. ``Maybe they're telling us
something we don't know.''
   The 29 Newarks spring from the granddaddy of them all,
Newark-on-Trent, a farming and manufacturing city in northeast
England founded 900 years ago.

   A passenger said it ``felt like death'' when
turbulent weather buffeted a United Airlines jumbo jet, tossing
babies in the air and bouncing luggage and a food cart off the
ceiling of the plane.
   At least 21 people were injured, none seriously, after a DC-10
bound for Chicago from Los Angeles dropped 100 to 200 feet Tuesday
while traveling at 37,000 feet over Kansas, officials said.
   Passengers said at least two babies were pulled from their
mothers' arms by the force of the drop, with one plucked out of the
air by a man who lunged to catch her. The other woman couldn't find
her baby for several minutes, said passenger James Jorgenson, 29, a
Racine, Wis., printing engineer.
   ``There was a woman in front of the plane holding a baby and I
saw that baby bounce off the ceiling,'' he said. ``I thought we were
done, I thought it was all over, it was that violent. Seats were
broken and luggage racks were broken.''
   ``It felt like death,'' said passenger James Phillips, the
president of a Wisconsin equipment company.
   Others on United Flight 90, which was carrying 232 passengers and
11 crew members, said they felt like they were riding in a roller
coaster or a dropping elevator.
   ``Anything that wasn't tied down flew up to bounce off the
ceiling,'' Jorgenson said.
   Four people were admitted to hospitals after the plane landed at
about 7 p.m. at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, authorities
said. Hospital spokesmen said they were in stable or good condition.
Three suffered head, neck, shoulder or back injuries, while a fourth
suffered chest pains, they said.
   Other injured passengers were treated and released.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said the plane was over Garden City,
Kan., ``when it encountered clear-air turbulence ... which means the
pilot couldn't see it.''
   ``The flight attendants said it lasted less than a minute, but
apparently the turbulence was pretty severe,'' Hopkins said.
   Jorgenson, who was returning from an aborted trip to China, said
he appreciated the irony of fleeing a riot in Beijing ``only to be
knocked around in Kansas.''

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS graf 5 to show that defense cuts planned over next
two years. Picks up graf 6 pvs, `Rocard's statement ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France will cut back its nuclear test program in a
move to limit rising defense costs, Premier Michel Rocard told a
parliamentary committee.
   In a written statement released Tuesday, Rocard told the National
Assembly's Defense Committee of the reduction plan but no details
were given. France conducts nuclear tests at its Pacific center at
Mururoa Atoll.
   New Zealand reported that France exploded a 20-kiloton nuclear
device Sunday at an underground site in French Polynesia believed to
be Muraroa. It was the third French nuclear test this year and the
106th in France's underground series.
   The government's policy is to neither confirm nor deny reports of
its nuclear tests. Rocard's statement did not say how many tests the
French had planned to carry out or how great the reduction would be.
   President Francois Mitterrand announced May 24 that the defense
budget would be cut $2.5 billion over the next two years. But the
defense budget still will increase by about 3 percent next year and
4 percent in 1991.
   Rocard's statement also said:
   The launching of a new generation of missile-launching submarines
would be set back about six months. Work on the new Rafale fighter
will be delayed for about two years and a battlefield radar
surveillance system called Orchidee will be delayed a year.
   In other reductions the statement said the number of fighter
planes destined for the armed forces would be cut from 33 to 28
units and the number of light transport vehicles to be delivered to
the army would be lowered.
   To avoid ``price drifts and financial approximations'' on major
programs a new external auditing system will be in place in the
autumn, Rocard said.
   It will be jointly directed by an army controller and an
inspector of finance and will be able to call on private auditing
agencies.

<HEAD>NCNB Launches Loan Program For Child Care In South Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank is offering low-interest loans for
the start-up or expansion of day-care centers to make child care
more widely available to working parents.
   ``The biggest `why?' is that we just really feel like it is the
right thing to do, because there is, as we perceived it, a
continuing need for quality day-care facilities in the state,'' said
H. Dabney Smith, a vice president of NCNB South Carolina, a regional
bank.
   The bank will lend money to operators of licensed child-care
programs at the bank's own cost of funds. On Monday, that would have
meant 8.53 percent for a 15-year loan, or nearly 3 percentage points
below the prime rate.
   Some of the loans will be guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business
Administration.
   ``It's a fairly new concept,'' Smith said. ``There have been
other things in other states with various governmental agencies
being involved, but this is the first thing we know of that a bank
has actually gone out and tried to do something to be of
assistance.''
   The program is limited to South Carolina for now, but Smith said
that if it is successful, North Carolina-based NCNB might expand it
to some of the other six states in which it operates.
   A spokesman for the American Bankers Association said he hadn't
heard of any similar loan programs.
   Sally Hardy of Yes Inc., a Columbia child-care resource and
referral agency, said the program was important symbolically and
financially.
   ``I know of child-care providers who quite frankly would expand
with this fund, who are waiting to take advantage of something like
this,'' she said. ``The fact that a major bank would come out and
make a commitment like this is certainly symbolic of the community
need.''
   The program also won praise from the office of Gov. Carroll
Campbell, who backed a compromise child-care measure passed earlier
this month to give tax breaks to businesses that offer child-care
programs to their employees.
   ``I think it very clearly dovetails with the legislative
initiatives of this year, which clearly focus on private sector
involvement in expanding day-care opportunities,'' said Tucker
Eskew, Campbell's spokesman.

   A 600-year-old landmark oak was
intentionally poisoned with a tree-killing herbicide, officials said.
   ``It's obviously not an accident,'' said John Giedraitis, a city
forester who has been directing efforts to save the Treaty Oak,
under whose branches legend has it Stephen F. Austin, the father of
Texas, signed a treaty with the Indians in the 1800s.
   The oak, with a branch spread of more than 100 feet, lost most of
its spring leaves but is putting out new leaves.
   The Texas Department of Agriculture, which has been investigating
the incident, said initial test results pointed to a strong
herbicide.
   ``It's pretty nasty. This chemical is used to kill trees. It's
not used to kill weeds. They knew what they were doing,'' Giedraitis
said. ``It's a pretty senseless act.''
   Treatment of the tree last week consisted of replacing
contaminated soil and injecting charcoal and bacteria into the
ground to neutralize the chemical.
   No more treatment is planned unless the oak, situated in a park,
loses its second set of leaves.

   Two Soviet journalists who defected
while in Alaska for the signing of a protocol easing East-West
travel restrictions have been granted asylum and are looking for
jobs in their profession.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service on Monday granted
asylum to Anatoly Tkachenko, 24, and Alexander Genkin, 25, who
defected on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Sea in April.
   ``I was surprised that it came so soon,'' Tkachenko said Tuesday.
``It was a very happy thing for us to know.''
   The men have been staying with a family in Anchorage.
   Tkachenko and Genkin were part of a Soviet delegation that went
to Alaska for the signing by Gov. Steve Cowper and his counterpart
from the Soviet region of Magadan of a protocol allowing travel
across the Bering Strait.
   Because of bad weather, however, Cowper handled his part by
telephone from Nome.
   For decades, natives with a common heritage had been restricted
from traveling across the Bering Strait to visit each other.
   Norbert Lague, INS deputy district director in Anchorage,
announced the agency's decision on asylum.
   Tkachenko said both men want to become U.S. citizens.
   He said he will remain in Anchorage for at least the next few
weeks while awaiting a decision about employment as a broadcast
journalist in Atlanta.
   Tkachenko said Genkin, who is learning English, is being
considered for broadcast employment on the East Coast.
   Shortly after the defections, Tkachenko cited a lack of freedom
in explaining why the men did not want to return.

<TEXT>
   Real estate tycoon Harry B. Helmsley is mentally
incompetent to stand trial on tax evasion charges, a judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker on Tuesday severed Helmsley from
the trial of his wife and two others after finding that the
80-year-old hotel magnate cannot assist in his defense because of
memory lapses and reasoning difficulties.
   The judge did not dismiss the 47-count indictment against
Helmsley, only delayed his trial indefinitely.
   But noting that medical experts expect Helmsley's mental
deterioration to continue, the judge said, ``For all practical
purposes, today's order will remain the final ruling in the
government's case against this defendant.''
   Citing several doctors, including a court-appointed
neuropsychologist, Walker said Helmsley's condition had been
aggravated by a series of slight strokes.
   Helmsley and his 68-year-old wife, Leona, were indicted in April
on charges they evaded personal income taxes by disguising about $4
million in renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as
business expenses.
   The couple head a $5 billion hotel and real-estate empire.
   ``Just as no man by position of wealth stands above the law,''
Walker said, ``so too will no man, who is unfit to stand trial, be
subjected to a trial simply because the public's interest in his
case is great, or simply because some people may erroneously
conclude that the system enables a wealthy man to avoid the
consequences of his conduct.''
   Helmsley declined to comment after the ruling and was ushered by
aides from the courthouse to a limousine. His wife did not attend
the hearing.
   Jury selection for the trial of Mrs. Helmsley and two former
aides begins June 26.

   The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers,
``thugs,'' bystanders and students have been killed during the
martial law occupation of Beijing.
   But most other estimates of casualties are far higher.
   State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000
people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other
soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded.
   Non-official sources say Yuan's figures on civilian casualties
are far too low, but most have different estimates on the number of
victims. They range from 500 to 12,000 people slain.
   In Washington, U.S. intelligence reports indicate 3,000 people
probably were killed, according to a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said estimates of the number of dead
could go higher.
   Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and
early Sunday when troops, firing randomly into large crowds, smashed
through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack
demonstrators demanding democratic reforms.
   One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed
the death toll at 500.
   Other sources, compiling various reports and surveys, estimated
more than 1,000 people had been killed.
   That number has increased with additional details and rumors of
killings.
   Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed
but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures.
   One Hong Kong newspaper reported 5,000 deaths and 30,000 injured.
   An Eastern European diplomat, whose country has good relations
with China, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldiers as
they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   That figure is certainly high. Probably fewer than 10,000 people
were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to
escape unharmed.
   But students who had joined the Tiananmen occupation said
hundreds of colleagues from the Academy of Fine Arts who were
huddled around their ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue in the square
were shot or crushed by tanks. Beijing University students said 150
of their fellow students who were in the square are missing.
   There were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned
many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by
helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count.
   Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured
were students.
   The exact number of people killed may never be known.
   Victims were taken to dozens of hospitals, clinics and homes, and
there is no indication the government will reveal many details of
the tragedy.
   And the death toll mounts. Troops manning checkpoints in central
Beijing continue to fire on unfriendly crowds and victims fall.

   A 78-year-old man who said he snapped under
the pressure of constant nagging received 10 years' probation for
strangling his ailing wife of 56 years.
   ``You took care of a very ill woman. It's important that you not

   ``Thanks a million, your honor,'' he said.
   Garfinkle, who had pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in

   The district attorney's office had left the decision to Richette,

<DATELINE>NORFOLK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battleship USS Iowa left today for a six-month
tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea with the cause of a gun turret
explosion that killed 47 sailors still uncertain.
   Several dozen relatives of the 1,500 crewmen gathered at the
Norfolk Naval Station to watch the ship leave. Family members waved,
cried and embraced each other as the ship pulled away, its crew in
dress whites lining the rails.
   Cherrie Todd said she and her husband, seaman Ernest Todd, were
worried about the ship's safety.
   ``It's scary,'' she said. ``You don't know what to expect.'' She
said her husband has 18 months left in the Navy and is anxious to
leave the battleship.
   Other relatives said they were not worried. ``It doesn't seem to
be anything that would happen again,'' said Cindy Jegel, the wife of
a crewman.
   The No. 2 turret damaged in an April 19 explosion in one of the
ship's 16-inch guns will be used during the deployment to train
replacements for the dead sailors in the workings of the gun, ship
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth said Tuesday.
   However, the Navy has barred the firing of 16-inch guns aboard
any of its four battleships until the Iowa investigation is
completed.
   Shipboard work on the investigation has been completed, the Navy
said. Although the turret is not in working condition, crew members
said the guns can be moved and the area of the blast has been
cleaned up.
   The ship will undergo about $13 million in repairs when it
returns from the Mediterranean.
   Navy investigators have yet to report on the cause of the
explosion during an exercise off Puerto Rico. Speculation has
focused on faulty gunpowder, inadequate training and a crewman who
may have set the blast to commit suicide.
   Despite uncertainty about the cause, Iowa sailors who spoke to
reporters said they were anxious to resume firing the World War II
battleship's 16-inch guns.
   ``The longer you wait, the more you're going to think about it.
The sooner we do it, the better off the whole crew is going to be,''
said Rick, a fire control crewman who spoke on condition his last
name not be used.
   The Iowa will have the use of its six five-inch guns and
surface-to-surface missiles during the tour of duty.

   Warm, humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico clashed
with high-altitude winds today, creating violent thunderstorms in
Oklahoma and Texas.
   A pregnant mother of five died when winds overturned her mobile
home Tuesday night near Garden City, in western Texas, authorities
said. The woman's oldest child suffered a broken leg.
   The storms moved through northern Texas early today, causing hail
the size of golf balls and flash flooding that stranded motorists
and apartment dwellers in Wichita Falls.
   Flash-flood war, and much of the central and southern Plains, and
severe thunderstorms across north central and northeast Texas and
much of Oklahoma.
   High temperatures were forecast in the upper 60s over northeast
Minnesota, and along portions of the California coast; in the 90s
from southern and central Texas across the southern Rockies, the
southern Plateau and inland valleys of California into southern
Oregon, as well as over southern Minnesota; above 100 degrees over
the desert Southwest and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and in the
70s and 80s over much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 85 degrees at Blythe,
Calif.

   A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel was hacked to death with a hatchet and hanged naked by chains
from a utility pole in the occupied West Bank today, Arab news
reports said.
   Masked youths also seriously injured a Palestinian woman and her
teen-age daughter, who were accused of aiding the Israelis, beating
them with clubs and chains and stabbing them.
   The army confirmed the Arab man was slain in the city of Nablus.
It said the victim had a criminal background and that police were
investigating.
   Also today, soldiers maintained a curfew for a fourth day in the
occupied Gaza Strip, confining more than 700,000 people indoors.
   The restrictions have prevented nine of an Arab hospital's 12
doctors from reaching work because the physicians lacked special
curfew passes, said Jorgen Rosendal, director of the Ahli Arab
Hospital in Gaza City.
   Palestinian doctors said a 75-year-old Gaza man was hospitalized
after being struck in the head with a bullet when troops opened fire
on stone-throwing demonstrators at the Shati refugee camp.
   Also in Gaza, soldiers blew up the home of a 17-year-old
Palestinian convicted in a military court of leading
Molotov-cocktail attacks on Israeli patrols. The home in the town of
Beit Lahia belonged to the family of Basam Shaaban Ibrahim Makusi
and housed at least 13 people, neighbors said.
   A second home in Beit Lahia that belonged to the family Akilan
Suleiman Bamilat was bulldozed. Bamilat also was convicted of
anti-Israeli activities, the army said.
   The United States and international human rights groups have
strongly opposed Israel's use of home demolitions as a punitive
measure, saying it constitutes unfair collective punishment that
often is carried out before Palestinians are tried in court.
   In the West Bank village of Beita three Palestinians were wounded
in a clash between troops and stone-throwers that broke out as
soldiers conducted a search-and-arrest raid, Arab reports said.
   During the raid, soldiers also reportedly demolished two
illegally built homes in the village.
   The Israeli Maariv daily, meanwhile, quoted U.S. intelligence
experts as telling Israeli officials they expected an escalation in
the Palestinian uprising, as well as increased efforts by
Palestinian rebels to obtain firearms.
   Participants in the 18-month-old uprising so far have mainly used
stones and firebombs in their attacks.
   The death of the suspected collaborator, Ziad Abu Ras, 30, raised
to 509 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising, which has
also claimed the lives of 22 Israelis since beginning on Dec. 8,
1987.
   In all, 48 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on
charges of collaborating with Israelis during the uprising.
   The women accused of collaborating and beaten were in the West
Bank town of Qalqilya. Arab reports identified them as Najeeha
Kudruj, 45 and her daugher Lina, 17.
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman said Shamir
has rejected numerous appeals from the PLO for him to meet with the
organization's chairman, Yasser Arafat.
   Israel rejects any contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, claiming it is a terrorist organization bent on
Israel's destruction.
   In southern Lebanon today, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired
three rockets at positions manned by Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas, injuring at least three, police in Sidon said. It was
the seventh Israeli air attack in Lebanon this year.

<HEAD>Construction Industry Agrees to Traffic Management Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A proposal to get heavy trucks off the street
during rush hour has gotten the green light from major construction
unions and businesses, Mayor Tom Bradley said.
   Following long negotiations, city officials exempted trucks and
other equipment required to pour concrete, lay hot asphalt and erect
structural steel from the traffic- and smog-control plan, the mayor
announced Tuesday.
   In return, the construction industry agreed to shift its work
hours _ without premium pay _ to 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of the
current 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. to reduce truck and automobile traffic,
Bradley said.
   ``Compromises such as these will ensure cleaner air and provide
free-flowing streets and highways for all in the city of Los Angeles
and Southern California area,'' Bradley said.
   The plan is expected to go before the City Council next month.
   However, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose Finance and Revenue
Committee later in the day approved spending $250,000 to help
develop the plan, said much work remains.
   ``There are a lot of flaws to any program which deals with city
streets and doesn't deal with freeways,'' he said. ``And I don't
think you can deal with one city and not deal with surrounding
cities.''
   The plan's one-hour shift would remove about 125,000 construction
workers from city streets during the morning and afternoon
rush-hour, the mayor said.
   The altered work schedule involves 83 union locals, including
boiler makers, brick layers, carpenters, operating engineers,
Teamsters, general contractors, pipe trade workers and painters.
   The proposal, developed by the city with a regional air quality
control agency, would require truck operators to pay a surcharge to
use city streets during rush hour.

   Roman Catholic leaders facing a shortage of priests
have moved into the video age with a 30-second commercial that asks
young Bostonians to abandon society's self-indulgent values for the
religious life.
   ``If St. Paul were alive today, he would be on Madison Avenue,''
Cardinal Bernard Law joked on Tuesday in unveiling the TV spot.
   ``We have in our seminary some very successful yuppies,'' said
Law, whose 2 million-member archdiocese is the nation's
third-largest. ``They were in that scene but felt it wasn't
responding to the deepest feelings in their heart.''
   The church hopes stations will run the ad for free as a public
service announcement. It was developed for free by an ad executive.
   ``The attitude in the last 10 years has been `you can have it all
and you don't have to feel guilty about anything,''' said Michael
Fortuna, who put his agency to work on the campaign after reading
about the shortage of priests.
   Law said his archdiocese is short about 28 assistant pastors.
   The ad isn't much more than a blur of decadent visions: expensive
jewelry, fast cars, caviar and champagne. But at the end, the screen
goes black and a pair of hands emerge holding the Eucharist.
   ``A world that doesn't deny itself anything could use a few men
that do,'' says an on-screen message followed by a telephone number.
   The Rev. Frank Silver, who worked with Fortuna, said the church
has to take a more progressive approach if it's to compete with
things of the flesh.
   ``Priests don't get hit by a bolt of lightning. They go through a
natural process,'' he said. ``And we have to recognize the impact
the media has on people today. It's how we communicate.''
   The Rev. Gregory Sakowicz of Niles College, a Chicago seminary,
said he has used billboards to advertise the priesthood in his
diocese. He said a flashier approach to promoting the priesthood
wasn't necessarily less sincere.
   ``I certainly believe the priesthood is a call from God,'' he
said. ``A billboard or television ad isn't going to create a
vocation ... but it's planting a seed.''
   However, Sakowicz said the ads have not been ``real successful in
terms of actually getting men to the front door.''
   The Rev. John West tried to plant similar seeds in the Detroit
archdiocese in 1987 when he launched a campaign that included radio
spots and ads in Sports Illustrated and People magazine.

<TEXT>
   A man who has passed himself off as an
astronaut, senator, pro athlete and gynecologist says he's going
straight. He's entering politics.
   Robert J. Hunt, 27, is collecting signatures to run as himself
against Mayor George Colella. He said he made up his mind during a
three-month stint in jail.
   ``I will be the next mayor of Revere, I have no doubt,'' the man
of many disguises said Tuesday. ``I am honest. I think the people
are saying that if this guy can do what he did, maybe he can do
something for this community.''
   In his heyday, Hunt's favorite guise was that of an astronaut.
Wearing a uniform and aviation wings ordered from NASA, Hunt
lectured on aviation to pilots, went to the Marine Corps Ball and
drank tea with the lord mayor of Dublin.
   ``People like me,'' said Hunt, who trained as a plumber. ``I know
how to talk to people. I'll make a great politician.''
   Hunt shows little remorse about his past.
   ``I went to the White House, I was made citizens of countries, I
was an impersonator and there's no law against that,'' said Hunt.
``I had fun. I'm a thrill seeker.''
   According to information that surfaced after his arrest in
February on charges of swindling a couple out of $4,000, Hunt also
masqueraded as a fighter pilot, building contractor, baseball player
and Marine captain.
   Earlier this year, he was ordered to pay restitution to the
couple and placed on a year's probation. He was also convicted of
credit card fraud and put in jail.
   Hunt said his ``impersonations'' led to friendships with such
Vice President George Bush and Atlantis shuttle pilot Rick Hauck.
   During his years of posing as others, Hunt said he was never
tripped up by anyone. He said he reads voraciously on subjects like
aviation and nuclear war and picked up other knowledge from ``my
friends in high places.''
   The only time Hunt recalls faltering was during a lecture to
pilots when someone asked the ``climb rate'' of a F-18 fighter and
he was off by 2,000 feet.
   ``They just thought I was tired,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Troops in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan have
not been able to halt bloody ethnic riots that have left 67 people
dead and prompted thousands to flee, officials and a newspaper
reported today.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress of People's
Deputies the situation was under control but not stable, and said
there were still incidents of arson and killing.
   ``It has not changed for the better,'' Gorbachev said. ``It
concerns us very much.''
   The Congress joined him in appealing to ethnic Uzbeks and Meshki
Turks to halt the bloodshed.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, in an interview published today
in the communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said, ``It is
now difficult to maintain stability in areas where Uzbeks and Meshki
Turks live together.''
   He told the newspaper 11,000 of the 15,000 ethnic Turks living
among the 2 million Uzbeks in the Fergana region of Central Asia
have been evacuated to temporary refugee camps.
   The unrest, which broke out on May 23, has mainly involved Uzbeks
and the Turkish minority.
   The newspaper said 67 people have died and 417 homes were burned
in the rioting. Most who lost their homes were ethnic Turks, it said.
   It also said 87 soldiers have been injured.
   The Communist Party daily, Pravda, said 9,000 Interior Ministry
soldiers were trying to maintain order in the Fergana Valley, a
cotton- and grape-growing region of eastern Uzbekistan near
Afghanistan.
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin exiled about 300,000 ethnic Turks to
Uzebekistan in the 1940s. The Turkish minority, who are Moslems,
have pressed recently to return to their homeland in Soviet Georgia,
near the Turkish border.
   The violence is the latest ethnic dispute in the southern Soviet
Union, where unrest in the Caucasus area and Central Asia has killed
scores of people and left thousands homeless.
   Nishanov said the violence in Uzbekistan began with a dispute
over the price of strawberries in a market.
   Uzbeki sources said it started between an ethnic Turk and a
Tadzhik and Kirghizian, two other local ethnic groups. But Uzbekis
resentful of the Turks joined the fray.
   The youth newspaper said soldiers trying to end the violence had
``honestly fulfilled their duty.''
   There was national outcry after soldiers in Soviet Georgia used
chemicals, shovels and clubs to break up a pro-independence protest
on April 9. Nineteen civilians were killed, and one was shot by
soldiers for violating a curfew.
   Bakatin said arson, robbery, and looting attempts persisted in
Uzbekistan despite the heavy military and police presence. He said
315 people were arrested for violating curfew.
   Soldiers guarded streets, squares, government buildings and fire
stations, the interior minister was quoted as saying.
   Chronic local unemployment and economic downturn has also added
to tension in the region.
   The Meskhi were the principal labor force used to build an
irrigation system in barren north-central Uzbekistan, which became a
flourishing farm district. Emigre sources say many were overworked
and died.

   Mayoral candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani is taking
an earlier-than-planned leave from his law firm to avert further
attacks over its work for the Panamanian government.
   The former chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan said through a
spokesman Tuesday that he will leave the payroll of White &amp; Case on
June 15 and close out his work there by June 30. Giuliani had
planned to leave later this summer.
   He moved now to devote more time to campaigning and defuse
criticism over his affiliation with the firm, said spokesman Charles
Perkins.
   Giuliani's opponents have suggested the Republican tainted
himself by joining a firm with links to Panamanian dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment in the United States
on drug smuggling charges.
   ``The people scared by his candidacy have been able to divert
attention from the real issues facing this city,'' Perkins said. By
leaving the firm, he said, Giuliani hoped to refocus on crime,
corruption and drugs.
   Giuliani joined White &amp; Case in February, a month after he
resigned as U.S. attorney. The firm has been a registered agent of
Panama since 1981 and reportedly has worked for a government-owned
bank there. Giuliani has said he did not know of the representation
until news reports disclosed it.
   Cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, Giuliani's rival for the GOP
nomination, has attacked him for the Panama connection in his
campaign ads.
   Giuliani asked White &amp; Case to sever its relationship with Panama
with the exception of work approved by the U.S. or
Panamanian-opposition governments, and the firm complied, Perkins
said.

   A first-in-the-nation plan under which Boston
University will take over Chelsea's troubled school system is headed
for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' desk, where its fate was unclear.
   The Senate gave the plan final approval in a voice vote late
Tuesday. House endorsement came earlier in a 122-24 vote after a
sometimes personal debate that had some lawmakers near tears.
   Under the plan, BU would run the 3,500-student system for 10
years and pump in money from private donors and foundations for a
variety of new programs, including early childhood education,
counseling and nutritional services.
   Legislators and teachers, however, have raised concerns about
provisions exempting BU from open-meeting and public-records laws.
Teachers fear BU may make key personnel and salary decisions behind
closed doors.
   Dukakis has said he supports the concept but would not back the
measure unless such concerns were addressed. The Legislature added
no such amendments.
   Press secretary Mindy Lubber said Dukakis was reviewing the
legislation this morning and ``will do something today'' without
indicating what action that would be.
   Chelsea schools have been woefully underfunded, according to
officials, and the school system in the largely working-class,
Spanish-speaking city outside Boston has one of the highest dropout
rates in the state.
   Rep. Marie Louise Kehoe of Dedham, though a supporter of the
concept, said Tuesday she was concerned about the public-scrutiny
provisions.
   Shouting at times, Rep. Richard Voke of Chelsea replied, ``These
are kids that deserve a shot. Who do you think is going to appear if
BU walks away?''
   In an oblique reference to Kehoe's husband, who is a car dealer,
Voke said, ``People who own car dealerships and people who own banks
don't live in Chelsea.''

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of mourners today chanted
support for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's interim successor, Ali
Khamenei, at a memorial service for the revolutionary patriarch at
Tehran University.
   Iranian new reports said almost 11,000 had been injured during
the demonstrations of national grief since Khomeini died on Saturday
night.
   Tehran radio quoted an unidentified health official as saying
``many died,'' but no number was given. Eight deaths were reported
on Monday.
   News reports said 438 people had been taken to hospitals.
   Carrying black flags and portraits of the imam, or spiritual
leader, today's crowds at Tehran University chanted ``The imam is in
heaven today'' and ``Better we were dead and you were here with us.''
   The 86-year-old Khomeini, who turned Iran into a fundamentalist
Islamic state after the overthrow of a 2,500-year-old monarchy in
1979, died of a heart attack on Saturday. He had undergone
intestinal surgery 11 days earlier.
   Today's memorial service was held at the site of a weekly prayer
service. Attending were Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi, Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili, Khomeini's
son Ahmad, and Khamenei.
   Khamenei, Iran's president, was named caretaker leader on Sunday,
winning 60 of 74 votes cast by the Assembly of Experts. Khomeini had
formed the group to handle his succession.
   ``Obedience to Khamenei is obedience to the imam of Ummah (The
Islamic nation),'' the crowd chanted.
   After the ceremony, many people beat themselves rhythmically on
the head in a traditional gesture of grief by Shiite Moslems.
   Many fainted in the heat. They were lifted above the crowd and
passed overhead to stretchers that took them to first-aid stations.
   However, life was gradually returning to normal a day after the
city was convulsed with grief during the funeral of Khomeini.
   Shops reopened today with long lines for bread and other
supplies. Heavy traffic also reappeared on the streets; private cars
carried black flags and portraits of Khomeini on their windshields.
   Also today, the official Islamic Republic news agency reported
that Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, whom Khomeini removed as his
designated successor in March, visited his grave in Beheshte Zehra
cemetery.
   The news agency said the cemetery was still mobbed with people
paying their respects at the grave.
   On Tuesday, mourners blocked a van carrying the body in an open
coffin from the square where it laid in state for 24 hours in an
air-conditioned glass cubicle.
   Scrambling for mementos, they grabbed the white burial shroud and
tore it to shreds. The body, which fell to the ground, was taken
away in an ambulance and lifted by helicopter to the gravesite.

<HEAD>Citywide Child Care Measure Defeated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A first-in-the-nation measure that would
have taxed residents and businesses to pay for day care citywide was
trounced at the polls.
   ``It's a resounding victory for those family values that have
gotten us this far,'' said Michael Samson of the Pro-Family
Coalition for Better Child Care, which opposed the measure. He said
before the election Tuesday that parents who had already raised
children without help would defeat the measure.
   With all ballots counted, 3,671 or 22 percent voted in favor of
the measure, and 12,697 or 78 percent voted against it. The tax
needed a two-thirds majority to become law in this city of 165,000
on the San Francisco Bay.
   Under Measure B, households would have paid an additional $12
annually and businesses a 20 percent tax surcharge to raise $1
million annually. An additional $800,000 would have come from
general funds and developer fees.
   The money was slated to buy 30 portable day-care classrooms,
provide child-care vouchers for poor families and train child-care
providers.
   While other cities subsidize child care for the poor, Fremont
attempted to tax citizens directly to pay for child care for the
entire community.
   The proposal drew support from working parents, feminists and
business leaders.
   Paul Miller of the pro-Measure B Citizens for Quality Child Care
said he may return with another version. ``Children don't go away,''
he said. ``People are going to have to recognize and deal with it
one way or another.''
   Supporters of the measure maintained that ``children are the
responsibility of the entire community and that's precisely the
point of disagreement,'' Samson said. ``We're frightened by that
point. Children are the responsibility of their parents except where
financial assistance is a necessity.''
   Despite the lopsided defeat, just getting the measure on the
ballot is an accomplishment and a signal the public recognizes child
care is ``a pervasive problem for all classes,'' said state
Assemblyman Tom Bates, co-chairman of a task force on the changing
family.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the June 6:
   Los Angeles Times on China's response to student protests:
   In the end, the old men who cling to power in China could think
of no better way to deal with six weeks of popular clamor for change
than by ordering the army to turn its machine guns and tanks against
the protesters.
   The ensuing slaughter in the streets of Beijing has appalled the
world and quite probably severed the final cords of respect linking
China's ruled with their rulers. ... It was a response of a kind
that invites open rebellion.
   At no point during the demonstrations did the protesters ever
attack the unique authority claimed and exercised by the Communist
Party. ... Instead there were calls for a freer press, for curbs on
rampant official corruption and nepotism, for the regime to pay more
attention to what the students and the masses want. ...
   The regime has claimed from the beginning and claims now that
only a handful of troublemakers were involved in the calls for a
freer society. That attempt to minimize the depth of the protests
fools no politically aware person in China.
   What has taken place, what still goes on, is a mass protest
triggered by frustration and anger over economic and political
conditions. ... The costs of this morally odious action to China's
stability, to its international standing, to its prospects for
future development are certain to prove enormous.

   Dallas Times Herald on democratization moves in communist
countries:
   The images from the communist world have been stunning. Poland
has just held elections, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are discussing
democratization, and popular nationalist movements have arisen in
the western region of the Soviet Union.
   China has been all but paralyzed as its citizens demand
democratization under the gaze of a statue of Liberty erected
opposite the stern gaze of Chairman Mao.
   In the Soviet Union, more than 200 million people have watched
telecasts of elected delegates to the Congress of People's Deputies
denouncing the party, the president, Stalin and the KGB.
   Throughout the Third World, young nations that had embraced the
egalitarian nature of communist doctrine have reversed themselves,
and appealed to the International Monetary Fund for economic
guidance. ...
   The West has no active roll to play in the drama engulfing these
nations. But Ronald Reagan in his second term and President Bush of
late have correctly noted that an economic hand extended during
periods of liberalization in communist countries pays dividends to
all.
   In the future, economic relations with the communist bloc should
be geared to the degree of which these nations reform themselves and
encourage private-market initiatives.
   That won't prompt the East to embrace capitalism. But it will
stimulate the transition from a political system economically
bankrupt at its inception to a new economic and political order
befitting a world about to move into the 21st century.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the death of Khomeini:
   The malevolent ayatollah is dead but that doesn't mean Iran will
soon rejoin the community of nations or that 15 hostages _ including
nine Americans _ being held in Iran's name will soon be freed.
   The death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (on) Saturday at age 86
seems certain to trigger a power struggle among religious mullahs
whose disagreements he often arbitrated. The regime of President Ali
Khamenei, whose term expires in October, is considered to be only an
interim caretaker government.
   Time will tell if the death of Khomeini will loosen the
revolution's draconian grip on Iranian society _ or if the
revolution will long survive his charismatic, authoritarian
leadership.
   An era ended in Iran with Khomeini's passing. The United States
can only hope that moderates will somehow gain a significant voice
in whatever government follows Khomeini's awful regime.

   The Saginaw (Mich.) News on the death of Khomeini:
   Iran mourns. But he lived too long, the Ayatollah Khomeini.
   Whatever homage Iranians pay him, elsewhere he was a throwback to
the Dark Ages of a faith blind to humanity, full of vengeance absent
of the mercy of civilization.
   Khomeini did not keep his counsel within his own land, but sought
to spread abroad his malevolent brand of fundamentalism, archaic and
alien even to most Moslems.
   If he was a holy man, he was a bitter one, with malice toward
nearly all, charity toward virtually none.
   Nor does it seem likely that Iran will soon veer from his course.
For the hostages, for Mideast peace, his death offers some slight
chance.
   But those of good will should not count on reciprocation.
Khomeini was a modern aberration, but modern times teach that the
gleam of evil finds all too many reflections.

   Like so many others _ from Oliver North to John Tower to Gary

glories are his, but his failures are someone else's fault.
   That is not leadership, or statesmanship, or even accountable

   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on Bush-Soviets:
   President Bush has responded effectively to recent policy
initiatives by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The president acted decisively in his visit to West Germany,
particularly with his statement on arms reduction and his call for
the East Bloc to tear down the Berlin Wall and to ``bury'' the Cold
War.
   Bush's more assertive approach not only scored points in the
public relations war with the Soviet Union. It also was
well-received in this country, where public opinion has tended to
believe that Gorbachev's reforms and less bellicose attitude are
genuine and hopeful signs.
   There is no assurance that reforms now under way in the Soviet
Union, the East Bloc countries or in China will succeed. Repression
may return.
   But whatever happens, the people in communist-dominated countries
never again will be as docile or submissive as they have been for
the past 70 years in the USSR and the past 40 years in China.
   Bush is right in encouraging these reforms. He is right in
challenging Soviet leaders to reduce armaments to a level that makes
sense for defense, but drastically reduces offensive capability.

   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on the Berlin Wall:
   President Kennedy was the first to issue the call. That was in
1963.
   President Carter repeated the message in 1978 and President
Reagan in 1987. Now President Bush, as he should, has added his
voice.
   Speaking in West Germany, Bush called on the Soviet Union to tear
down the Berlin Wall: ``The wall stands as a monument to the failure
of communism. It must come down. Make all Berlin a center of
commerce between East and West _ a place of cooperation, not
confrontation.''
   Bush thus has managed to put a bit of political pressure on
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who visits West Germany in mid-June.
   Europeans in general and the West Germans in particualr have
welcomed the apparent conciliation and cooperation that have been
Gorbachev's hallmark since he took power in Moscow. But the blunt
reality is that ``glasnost'' will be little more than a pretty word
as long as the Berlin Wall stands.
   The Soviets should back up their words with deeds _ and start by
dismantling the Berlin Wall.

<TEXT>
   The government said today that savings and loan
customers withdrew $5.4 billion from their accounts in April, a high
number but an improvement compared with the record outflows earlier
in the year.
   It was the 12th consecutive month of withdrawals and the sixth in
a row when outflows exceeded $5 billion, according to a report by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's 2,934
S&amp;Ls.
   In the first four months of the year, customers withdrew $33.7
billion more than they deposited, compared with a $16.2 billion gain
in deposits during the same period of last year.
   Withdrawals set a one-month record of $10.8 billion in January,
slipping to $9.2 billion in February and $8.3 billion in March.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said the April
figure is better than it at first appears.
   ``About half of the outflow is accounted for by 10 thrifts, four
of which are insolvent,'' he said in a statement. ``The deposit
outflow figures are even smaller when you account for seasonal
factors, since one of the poorest deposit flow months of the year is
April when people are paying income taxes.
   ``On a seasonally adjusted basis, the outflow was $1.6 billion,
down sharply from $6.7 billion in March, and the smallest outflow
since ... last September.''
   Barth attributed the continuing withdrawals to the failure of
S&amp;Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors
such as mutual funds and to orders from regulators requiring
overextended thrift institutions to shrink.
   Private analysts say lack of public confidence in S&amp;Ls is also a
factor. To remedy that, the Bush administration has urged Congress
to move more swiftly on its bailout plan, now not expected to reach
the president's desk until next month.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected an attempt
by lawmakers today to name maverick Communist leader Boris Yeltsin
as head of a government watchdog agency.
   Gorbachev proposed Gennady Kolbin, party chief of the Central
Asian republic of Kazakhstan, to head the People's Control
Committee, which oversees government planning and spending. But a
parade of Supreme Soviet deputies took the floor to promote Yeltsin
for the job.
   They praised Yeltsin's reputation for independence and battling
corruption, which they said made him better suited for the post.
Gorbachev, however, insisted it was his constitutional right to name
his own choice, subject only to the legislature's consent.
   After permitting more than an hour of debate, during which
deputies spoke on behalf of either Yeltsin or Kolbin, the president
moved to cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted
in overwhelming confirmation of Kolbin.
   Yeltsin himself took the floor near the end to say he thought
Kolbin was qualified for the post, but he did not withdraw himself
from the running.
   Only nine of the 509 deputies participating voted to reject
Kolbin; 34 deputies abstained. Under the confirmation procedure,
Yeltsin's name was not submitted for a vote.
   Earlier in the day, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was bombarded with
lawmakers' complaints about the Soviet Union's economic and
environmental ills, then won near-unanimous approval to remain at
the helm of the country's vast bureaucracy.
   The new Supreme Soviet legislature, elected from the membership
of the Congress of People's Deputies, confirmed Ryzhkov with 500 of
the 509 deputies voting for the 59-year-old technocrat.
   Ryzhkov, a former factory director, has been premier since
September 1985, overseeing efforts to implement Gorbachev's economic
and political reforms.
   Already tapped for the post by Gorbachev and endorsed by the
Communist Party, he had been expected to win confirmation by the new
legislature.
   Gorbachev praised Ryzhkov as a ``determined proponent of the
policy of perestroika'' and defended his record as the country's
economic chief.
   But other legislators grilled him about poverty, poor
agricultural performance, a shortage of consumer goods and the
ecological crises in many Soviet cities.
   Yuri Komarov, a deputy from Siberia, commented that Gosagroprom,
an agricultural superministry created at the start of Gorbachev's
reforms and abolished last March, was so inefficient that ``people
were saying it was the most successful action by the CIA against the
Soviet economy.'
   A Lithuanian deputy demanded to know what the government plans to
do about 43 million Soviets he said are living below the poverty
line, calling their position ``disastrous.'' Ryzhkov agreed that
something must be done but did not specify what.
   Deputy Anatoly Miloserdny of Byelorussia blamed the Council of
Ministers that Ryzhkov heads for short-sightedness, saying it had
led to a shortage of ``the most basic consumer goods.''
   Ryzhkov denied that the council had made ``strategic errors'' in
implementing reforms but admitted to ``some specific mistakes that
had a negative effect on the economy.''
   For example, he said attempts to make state enterprises more
independent led to an ``unbalancing of the consumer market.''

   The butcher raised his cleaver and slammed it into
the neck of a duck at a Chinatown grocery store.
   ``Killers,'' he spat out as he chopped the duck and listened with
two other men to a Chinese-language radio broadcast on the weekend
massacre in Beijing.
   Anguish pervades this Chinese enclave south of downtown Chicago,
as it does in other Chinatowns around the country.
   Groups of people _ mostly men _ squat on street corners or sit in
restaurants. Newspapers in hand, they talk about the military
suppression of the China's student-led, pro-democracy movement.
   ``The tanks,'' said James Yuan, pointing at a newspaper picture
of the scene in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ``Students were in a
tent. The tanks, they crush them, over and over! Until all bodies be
a mess! A mess!''
   Yuan's face twisted in pain and he took off his glasses to wipe
the corners of his eyes. A pastor at the Chinese Christian Union
Church, Yuan was handing out fliers advertising a prayer service.
   ``The only thing we can do is pray,'' he said.
   About 16,000 people live in the 15-square-block Chinatown. The
district's commercial strip is a tourist attraction with its
welcoming green and red gate and blocks of restaurants and gift
stores.
   After the massacre, residents of Chinatowns in San Francisco, New
York, Los Angeles and elsewhere held demonstrations against China's
hard-line leader Deng Xiaoping.
   In Chicago, Chinatown residents grab for the World Journal and
other Chinese-language newspapers every morning, said Esther Ti-yu
Hsiao, a reporter for the World Journal's Chicago bureau. Some wait
for an hour by news stands for delivery trucks that arrive at 10 a.m.
   Advertisements in the World Journal announced a meeting planned
for Sunday to raise money to buy facsimile machines to get news out
of China and medical supplies and airline tickets for students who
want to go to China to demonstrate.
   ``It's going to be very dangerous,'' Ms. Hsiao said, nodding.
``There are rumors that doctors who treat the wounded in Beijing are
executed.''
   Rumors seemed to be as prevalent as hard news along the
commercial strip.
   ``I heard that Deng Xiaoping is dead,'' a bartender said in the
Three Happiness restaurant. The Chinese government on Tuesday denied
the rumor.
   At Mabel Lee Moy's Four Seasons Travel and Services Inc., Ms. Moy
has been counseling people not to return to China.
   ``I tell them they better think it over before they go,'' Ms. Moy
said. ``Everyone in Chinatown knows each other and I'm not going to
put anyone's life in danger just to sell a ticket.''
   Many people in Chinatown, like the butcher, would not talk with a
reporter, and some who did would not give their names.
   ``I don't even feel like eating,'' said a Chinese student who
declined to give her name. She works part time in a gift shop packed
with paper fans and miniature Buddhas.
   Her family, including her husband, are still in Beijing. She
talked with them by telephone on Monday.
   ``My brother and my husband spent the whole night at Tiananmen
Square the time they started shooting,'' she said.
   ``I'm lonely here,'' she said, adding she had planned to return
to China next year. ``Now I don't know when I can see my family.''

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan told
a joint meeting of Congress today that Pakistan does not possess a
nuclear weapon, will not build one and ``will not provoke a nuclear
arms race'' on the Indian subcontinent.
   Ms. Bhutto made her pledge in an address in which she said
democracy is on the rise in her region and dictators are in retreat
around the world.
   She said the United State and Pakistan represent a partnership
for democracy that must redouble its efforts to bring a broad-based,
democratic government to war-scarred Afghanistan.
   ``Pakistan and the United States have traveled a long road with
Afghanistan in quest of self determination,'' the Pakistani prime
minister said.
   She said that now that Soviet forces have withdrawn, ``let us not
leave with indifference, we must not abandon the cause.''
   Turning to the most active concern voiced in the United States
about her country's conduct, Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan has no
intention of becoming a nuclear weapons power.
   ``I can declare that we do not possess nor do we intend to make a
nuclear device,'' the Pakistani prime minister said.
   She said her government is ready to accept international
safeguards on its nuclear materials and reactors ``on a
non-discriminatory regional basis.''
   Pakistan has long advocated a nuclear-free zone in the region,
Ms. Bhutto said, adding that her country is prepared to conclude a
nuclear test ban with neighbors in South Asia.
   She mentioned no other country. Pakistan's regional rival, India,
has resisted such proposals unless they include China which already
has nuclear weapons.
   Ms. Bhutto told her audience gathered in the chamber of the House
of Representatives: ``We will not provoke a nuclear arms race on the
subcontinent.''
   Earlier, a senior administration official told reporters that the
United States has agreed to sell Pakistan 60 more F-16 fighter jets,
meeting a longstanding request by the Moslem nation.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Tuesday night that the deal, which was not officially announced, was
complete except for congressional notification. He spoke with
reporters after a state dinner in honor of Ms. Bhutto.
   The F-16 deal reportedly is worth about $1.4 billion.
   President Bush and Ms. Bhutto's talks Tuesday focused on the
bloody conflict in Afghanistan, Pakistan's defense needs, its
nuclear program, and the international battle against illicit drugs,
officials said afterwards.
   The United States and Pakistan, which has given refuge to 3.6
million Afghan refugees, have cooperated for years in the effort to
support the Afghan rebels seeking to topple Kabul's Marxist
government.
   With a glittering dinner and a full-dress military review, Bush
orchestrated a warm White House welcome for the 35-year-old Ms.
Bhutto, who is the first woman to lead a Moslem nation and is the
world's youngest prime minister.
   In his formal farewell remarks, Bush said he and Ms. Bhutto had
``discussed ways to encourage a political solution in Afghanistan''
that would replace the ``illegitimate regime in Kabul'' with a
peaceful and non-aligned representative government.
   ``The United States and Pakistan will continue to explore any
serious avenue towards this end,'' Bush said.
   Ms. Bhutto replied: ``We are in complete accord'' on the course
of policy in regards to Afghanistan. She added that Pakistan
``remains committed to a political solution of the Afghan problem.''
   The late President Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq, Ms. Bhutoo's predecessor,
had rejected the idea of a political settlement in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   Ms. Bhutto's father was by deposed Zia in 1977 and hanged two
years later. Zia remained in power until perishing in a mysterious
plane crash last year that also claimed the life of U.S. Ambassador
Arnold Raphel and an American general.
   Bush brushed aside reporters' attempts to ask about earlier
reports of the F-16 deal.
   An administration official, briefing reporters at the White
House, said Bush and Ms. Bhutto discussed the F-16 sale, but added
that he did not anticipate any specific announcement during her
visit. The official, speaking under condition of anonymity,
indicated there were no stumbling blocks to the sale.
   The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production
and trafficking. Bush said he applauded Ms. Bhutto's ``tough stance
on eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for
extraditing an alleged drug trafficker.
   After a luncheon in her honor at the State Department, Mrs.
Bhutto and Secretary of State James A. Baker III witnessed the
signing of agreeements providing for $465 million to help Pakistan
finance housing, narcotics and education programs.
   The agreements are part of a $2.28 billion, six-year aid package
designed to support Pakistan's economic development, according to
the Agency for International Development. Pakistan is the third
largest recipient of U.S. aid.

   Two Cuban-born Republicans today entered the race
for the congressional seat left vacant by the death of Claude
Pepper, the liberal Democrat whose district came to be dominated by
conservative Hispanics.
   State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and conservative businessman
Carlos Perez announced bids to become the first Cuban-American in
Congress. The Miami Herald reported today that Democratic state Sen.
Jack Gordon also will run.
   The special election will be held Aug. 29.
   Ros-Lehtinen pledged to continue the district's tradition of ``a
leadership which has been based on a caring conscience and
conservative convictions. Claude Pepper's passing has left a void
that is nearly impossible to fill.''
   She said her priorities are bridging the ethnic and social
differences in the district, protecting Social Security, waging war
on drugs, taking a tough stand on Cuba and Nicaragua and strongly
supporting Israel.
   Gov. Bob Martinez called the special election on Tuesday, a day
after the 88-year-old congressman was buried in Tallahassee after a
week of mourning.
   ``Claude Pepper will be difficult, if not impossible, to replace
in Congress. But it's vitally important that we move as quickly as
possible so that the people of Florida's 18th congressional district
can be represented,'' Martinez said.
   Primaries were set for Aug. 1, with runoffs, if needed, on Aug.
15.
   Pepper was elected to the seat after its creation in 1962 and won
re-election by large margins every two years. He drew no opposition
last year.
   In his absence, Republicans are hoping to control the district,
whose registration is 54 percent Democrat, down from 72 percent a
decade ago. Hispanics are estimated to comprise nearly half the
district.
   ``I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be
elected,'' said Sergio Bendixen, a Democratic strategist. ``Without
a doubt, that person would be the most powerful Cuban-American in
the country.''
   The Miami area is home for many of the 1 million Cubans who have
come to the United States since Fidel Castro's revolution 30 years
ago.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, an independent elected in 1985 as the
city's first Cuban-born mayor, has indicated he will support
Ros-Lehtinen.
   Ros-Lehtinen, a 36-year-old educator, is married to popular U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who has said he is happy in his current
high-profile position.
   Perez, a millionaire banana importer, is a staunch supporter of
former President Reagan and Oliver North.
   Republican State Rep. Al Gutman, whose Cuban-Jewish heritage fits
two large ethnic groups in the district, also was mulling over a
candidacy.
   On the Democratic side, state Sen. Jack Gordon said he would
decide by Friday whether to run. Gordon, 67, shares much of Pepper's
constituency and liberalism, but may have problems with Hispanic
voters because of his opposition to Nicaraguan Contra aid.
   Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez, also Cuban-born, was a possible
Democratic contender as were Commissioner Rosario Kennedy, Miami
Beach Mayor Alex Daoud, Dade County Commissioner Joe Gersten, State
Attorney Janet Reno and former school board chairman Paul Cejas.

   Swarms of desert locusts have been spotted
in the West African nations of Mali, Mauritania and Niger, the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization said Wednesday.
   In a report from its Rome headquarters, the agency said the
swarms were rapidly moving east and may reach Chad or even as far as
western Sudan. The report said there might be extensive breeding
later in the year.
   The agency said most swarms were small, but one was reported to
cover an area of 60 square miles.
   Swarms of locusts emerged in West Africa at the end of last year
but have not been reported in past months. The report said the
locusts' flight activity was limited until about three weeks ago. It
was not immediately known what caused the change.
   The agency said it was monitoring the swarms and conducting
aerial insecticide spraying where possible.

   A gas producer has agreed to pay $2 million
to eight families forced from their homes by toxic waste, The Boston
Globe reported today.
   Colonial Gas Co. acknowledged dumping coal-gasification
byproducts decades ago where the homes were later built, the
newspaper reported.
   Under the settlement, to be announced today, Colonial will buy
the homes, pay damages and finance the continuing cleanup of the
site near the Concord River.
   The Globe quoted unidentified sources as saying the company, in
addition to paying each family $250,000, agreed to pay $750,000 to
the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering for testing,
fencing the site and cleaning it.
   Residents had claimed their homes were rendered worthless and the
land was so contaminated that sections turned blue from cyanide and
other pollutants. They were moved to condominiums last year, with
the state paying their rent.
   ``We're greatly relieved and very happy,'' said Timothy Keeley,
who moved with his wife and three children last year. ``It's like
being a bird in a cage and suddenly having the door sprung open.''
   The families' attorney, Jan Schlitchmann, told the Globe the
settlement is believed to be the first environmental case between a
company and homeowners to be resolved through mediation rather than
a lawsuit.
   Mediation took six months, Schlitchmann said.

   The Census Bureau launched an effort Wednesday
to get local government officials involved in making sure everyone
is counted in 1990.
   The agency said it is sending technical guides to 39,000 local
governments, encouraging them to review census maps to make sure all
housing units are included.
   More than 100 million census forms will be sent to American
households at the end of March 1990 to be used in completing the
national head count April 1.
   The bureau said it will hold 470 training sessions for local
officials across the nation.
   Then, later this summer, census maps will be sent to the local
governments for comparison with local tax records, occupancy and
demolition permits, utility hookups and other records to make sure
no home has been overlooked.
   Once that is completed the Census Bureau will compile
block-by-block housing counts and send them back to local officials
in November for yet another check prior to the actual census.
   Census counts are vital to city, state and other local
governments because those numbers are used to determine
representation in Congress and in the distribution of billions of
dollars in state and federal funds to communities.

   Between 12 and 22 percent of America's children
_ as many as 14 million of those under age 18 _ are suffering from
some type of mental disorder, but only about a third are receiving
any treatment, a study released today reported.
   A committee of the Institute of Medicine said in the study that
though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the
situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is
``demonstrable progress'' toward understanding, preventing and
correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters.
   ``There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major
childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment,'' the
committee said.
   But in far too many cases, no treatment at all is being offered
to troubled youngsters, the committee said.
   At a news conference today, committee chairman James F. Leckman
of Yale University said that of the mentally ill children ``a third
or less are treated,'' often because their problems go undetected or
because resources for care are not available.
   ``We have a long way to go,'' said Leckman. ``This group has been
underserved (by society). There is a stigma associated with mental
illness. That is a clear and persistent problem in our society.''
   Americans respond to physical disorders much more readily than to
mental health problems, said Dr. Fredric Solomon, director of the
mental health division of the Institute of Medicine.
   ``Eighty percent of the phyically disabled children are served,''
he said. ``For mental disorders, less than 20 percent of the
children are served, even if they are noticed.''
   Solomon said that studies have shown that even medical
professionals, such as pediatricians, generally recognize only about
about quarter of their patients who are suffering from mental
disorders. He said often the children who receive attention by
society are only those with disruptive behavior.
   Members of the committee said it is difficult to obtain reliable
data to precisely define how many of the childhood population are
suffering from mental problems, but Leckman said there are
indications that ``the likelihood is that the rate is increasing.''
   Dr. Glen R. Elliott, vice chairman of the committee and a
professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San
Francisco, said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood
suicides and in eating disorders.
   Though conservative estimates place the number of American
children with mental disorders at about 7.5 million, or 12 percent,
the committee said the number could be much higher.
   ``Recent studies have suggested that the ange may be as high as
17 to 22 percent, or 11 to 14 million children and adolescents,''
the report said.
   Problems identified in the report included mood disorders such as
depression, behavior disorders such as hyperactivity, developmental
disorders such as autism, as well as chronic drug use, sexual
problems and eating disorders including anorexia.
   ``Approximately 2.5 million children in this country received
treatment in 1985 for a mental disorder,'' the committee reported.
``This means that at least another 5 million other children needed
some type of intervention, but did not receive any treatment.''
   Poverty and ghetto life contribute heavily to the nation's
troubled youth, the study said.
   Youngsters with mental and behavioral problems ``may exceed 20
percent in some populations, such as inner-city children, who are
exposed to severe psychological adversity,'' the study said.
   The total cost to the nation has not been measured, but the
committee said the figure would probably run into the billions of
dollars a year.
   In addition to the costs of treatment, the committee said there
are substantial indirect costs from the need for social services,
criminal justice and special education.
   ``Each year in this nation about 49,000 children and youth are
held in various public youth facilities, and many thousands more are
in adult prisons,'' the study said. ``Millions of children are
involved with child welfare, foster care and residential treatment.
Many of these children have a diagnosable mental disorder, but
receive neither diagnosis nor treatment.''
   The study also said that about 25 percent of all mentally
retarded children also have behavioral and emotional difficulties.
These compound problems often result in such children being confined
for life to institutions.
   A national plan of coordinated research and training that would
attract more professionals to the mental health field, and lead to a
better understanding of how to prevent, evaluate and treat mental
illness in children was proposed by the committee. The report called
for a national investment of up to $198 million annually by the
fifth year.
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress as an adviser
to the federal government in scientific and technical matters.

<HEAD>Fed Opposes Bill to Require Ratings Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday opposed
legislation to make it disclose numerical ratings on how well banks
and other financial institutions lend money for community needs,
particularly low-income housing, small business and small farm loans.
   Martha R. Seger, one of the Fed's seven governors, said the
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings, if released publicly,
could be ``misunderstood'' as a reflection of financial soundness
and ``undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an
institution.''
   Under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits
back into lending for local needs, the Fed and other regulators now
rate banks, savings and loan associations and other deposit
institutions on a 1-to-5, best-to-worst scale.
   Like commerical examination ratings, the CRA numbers have been
treated by regulators as confidential, although on occasion they
have been used to challenge and deny a bank's application to expand.
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on
consumer affairs, Ms. Seger said the ratings were designed as a
``supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions
needing closer attention.''
   The number rating ``is in no way a self-explanatory indicator of
performance'' and can be misleading, she said.
   Nonetheless, she said, the Fed could support amending the 1977
law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each bank's
community reinvestment performance based on regulators' examinations.
   The subcommittee is considering a series of bills by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would require publishing of the numerical
ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash
government checks of non-depositors and provide low-cost checking
accounts to the poor and elderly.
   Civil rights and community activist groups have called for the
increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years
of ``redlining'' by financial insitutions in Atlanta, New York and
Detroit.
   Redlining is practice by which banks and S&amp;Ls have used zip codes
and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of
minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness.
   ``Many lenders still don't accept an obligation to reinvest
inner-city deposits in sound inner-city loans,'' said Gale Cincotta,
executive director of the National Training and Information Center,
a Chicago-based group that helps local organizations pressure banks
for CRA lending.
   Cincotta said the entire rating system lacks credibility because
the Fed and other regulators already give 1 and 2 _ excellent or
good _ ratings to 95 percent of the institutions.
   ``Disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this
credibility gap, and make it that much more likely that regulators
would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system,''
Cincotta said.
   Trade association lobbyists have opposed Metzenbaum's bill,
citing the arguments raised by both Ms. Seger and Cincotta as well
as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert
pressure for granting unsound loans.
   Metzenbaum tried to add the measures to President Bush's S&amp;L
bailout bill when it was considered by the Senate in April but
withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition.
   The banking subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
endorsed elements of Metzenbaum's proposal Wednesday but said he
also was sympathetic to the arguments made by Ms. Seger against
disclosing the numerical ratings.

   Authorities are examining the
policies of the far-right Republican Party to determine whether they
violate constitutional bans against extremist groups, officials said
Wednesday.
   The party might be banned if its policies are found to be
contrary to the country's charter, said Bavarian Interior Minister
Edmund Stoiber
   He said the party's election rallies have been marked by
``incredible intolerance and brutality.''
   The Republicans, led by former Nazi SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber,
are campaigning for the ouster of foreign workers from West Germany
and for limits on the number of people granted asylum in the country.
   Stoiber made the announcement 10 days before a vote for the
European Parliament. The Republicans' headquarters are in Munich,
the Bavarian capital.
   Although it is running for seats in the European Parliament, the
party rejects most European Economic Community policies. The
parliament, based in Strasbourg, France, consists of elected members
from each EEC nation.
   The party's views have been described by critics as similar to
those of neo-Nazis. And Stoiber said four of the Republicans' 20
candidates for the European Parliament have an ``extremist rightist
background.''
   As an example of the party's growing extremism, Stoiber quoted a
recent statement by its leader, Schoenhuber, who reportedly said:
``If Hitler was more aware of history, he would not have let himself
be dragged into war only six years after gaining power.''
   A regional Republican leader in Bavaria recently caused an uproar
by suggesting that the party's leftist opponents be sent to labor
camps.
   The Republicans scored major gains in recent state and municipal
elections, winning 11 seats in West Berlin's Senate and seats in
several local legislatures in Hesse state.
   Recent polls have predicted the party might get more than 5
percent in the national elections in December 1990, permitting it to
enter West Germany's federal parliament for the first time.
   Official Federal Interior Ministry documents until now have
described the Republicans as a ``radical'' rather than an
``extremist'' party. As such, the Republicans did not fall under
automatic observation by the country's top internal security agency,
the Verfassungsschutz.
   Groups judged ``extremist,'' whether rightist or leftist, are
routinely watched by the agency. Stoiber said authorities will
determine whether the Republicans might be qualified as
``extremist.'' If so, and their policies are contrary to the
constitution, they might be banned, Stoiber said.

   New House Speaker Tom Foley predicted today
that ``attack dogs will be curbed'' and wounds opened by the
resignation of Jim Wright will heal, but his prediction was tested
by harsh Republican attacks aimed at him and the Democratic Party.
   ``We should dispute about things of principle, things of policy
that we disagree about,'' Foley said. ``But we ought to be able to
do that without turning to personal attacks or recrimination.''
   ``I think the attack dogs are going to be curbed'' by the
Republicans and the Democrats, the Washington Democrat said on NBC's
``Today'' show.
   He later told reporters that Republican National Committee
Chairman Lee Atwater already had apologized for a document prepared
by a committee aide that attacked him as a closet liberal and
likened his voting record to that of Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an
acknowledged homosexual.
   Mark Goodin, RNC communications director and author of the
document, resigned at mid-day. He said he regretted preparing the
document but contended he never intended ``to damage anyone's
reputation.''
   Foley's concilatory comments today continued a theme he pressed
on the House upon taking the speaker's gavel Tuesday.
   ``We cannot tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and
suspicion and expect to fulfill the public's expectation,'' he said.
   Foley's words were meant to sooth a House shaken by an
extraordinary upheaval in the Democratic ranks, with two of the
three top party officers exiting because of questions about their
personal finances.
   Wright, D-Texas, resigned after the House ethics committee
charged him with violating House rules on outside income, and the
No. 3 Democrat, Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California, is stepping
down to avoid inquiry into a junk bond deal.
   The Democrats plan to meet next week to fill Foley's old post of
majority leader and the whip's job.
   Republicans have moved quickly to take advantage of the
Democratic turmoil, attacking Foley and telling Democrats they can't
run away from the ethics issue.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., turned the usually
good-willed gesture of introducing the new speaker to the House into
a strongly worded reminder that Republicans are seething after 35
years under the ruling Democrats.
   ``Thirty-five years of uninterrupted power can act like a
corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity,'' he
said. ``I am all in favor of putting our House in order _ but we
don't do so by sweeping things under the rug.''
   Earlier Tuesday, speaking to a Republican conference, Michel
said, ``The House has been corrupted by the absolute power of
one-party domination and it isn't going to be cured by a personality
transplant.''
   Many Democrats considered Michel's remarks a slap at the olive
branch Foley was extending.
   ``I think they could have been a little more conciliatory, a
little more healing,'' said Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich.
   A more personal shot at Foley from the Republican National
Committee was brushed aside by the new speaker, and he said today
that Atwater had called him to apologize.
   The RNC issued a paper comparing Foley's voting record to that of
Frank. The paper was headlined, ``Tom Foley, Out of the Liberal
Closet.''
   Frank took ire, calling the document ``despicable'' and said he
might expose gay Republican lawmakers if the GOP continues making
``scurrilous'' attacks.
   He noted that Republicans have not been immune from ethics
problems, citing the May 26 conviction of Rep. Donald Lukens,
R-Ohio, on charges of having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   Foley himself said he hadn't read the Republican paper and didn't
intend to. ``I'm not concerned about political action committees. I
want to work with the president, work with the leadership of the
Congress,'' he said.
   Foley also promised to meet Michel's demand for swift action on
an ethics and campaign reform package _ a goal Democrats also want
to meet in order to put the whole ethics issue to rest.
   Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., and Lynn Martin, R-Ill., the
co-chairmen of an already-operating task force on ethics, issued a
joint statement welcoming Foley's support.
   Foley also promised to renew the tradition of regular meetings of
the House Democratic and GOP leadership _ something Wright abandoned
more than a year ago. Foley intended to join Michel today for lunch
with President Bush at the White House.
   ``If there's anybody who has the ability to get us back on track
and away from the tenseness it's Tom Foley,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla.
   Foley was keeping at arms length from the scramble to fill
vacancies in the other House leadership slots.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is considered the leading candidate
to fill Foley's old post of majority leader. Foley campaigned for
Gephardt last year when Gephardt was seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., is challenging Gephardt for the leader's
job. Jenkins is from the conservative wing of the party and like
Gephardt is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
   The race for majority whip narrowed to three candidates on
Tuesday when Rep. Henry Waxman of California decided against a
campaign of his own and threw his support to Rep. William H. Gray
III.
   Gray, D-Pa., is the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. He's
facing two other prominent Democrats: David Bonior of Michigan, the
chief deputy whip, and Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, the chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

<HEAD>Recalls, Warnings Issued for Children's Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A toy boat and three types of baby strollers
are being recalled because of the danger of choking children,
according to a government agency which also issued a warning about a
type of crib toy.
   No reports of injuries have been received involving any of the
products, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
   Toys ``R'' Us of Paramus, N.J., is recalling the ``Toot Toot
Tug'' toy boat because a metal rod could become detached from the
toy and possibly pose a choking hazard, the commission reported.
   About 5,200 of the toys were sold nationwide for about $4.99, and
they can be returned for a refund, the commission said. The boats
can be identified by the name ``Primex-Shyf 4768.''
   The second recall involves baby strollers sold by McCrory Stores,
Inc., which has its headquarters in York, Pa.
   Plastic plugs sealing the tube ends on the strollers could come
loose and pose a choking hazard, officials said.
   The strollers were sold nationally in McCrory stores as well as
by Britt's, Elmore, H.L. Green, Kittinger, Kress, McClellan,
Newberry, Silver, TG&amp;Y and some independent stores, according to the
commission.
   Imported from Taiwan, the strollers involved are Model AT410 Item
129088 umbrella stroller; Model PHT438 item 128942 umbrella with
canopy stroller, and Model PHT417, item 129007 canopy stroller.
   Owners of the strollers should discontinue using them and contact
McCrory for details of a free modification kit. Write, including the
stroller's item number and style, to McCrory Stores, Dept. 06-Mail
Stop 0512, 2955 E. Market St., York, Pa., 17402.
   In addition to the recalls, the commission issued a warning about
a crib toy called Crib Kickers made by Red Calliope of Los Angeles.
   These toys consist of a series of polyester-filled figures such
as animals and flowers, attached to a ribbon for tying them across
the top of a crib or playpen.
   Such toys can pose a danger of strangling to children once the
infant is old enough to push itself up and possibly get caught in
the ribbon.
   A warning is supposed to accompany such toys urging parents to
remove them when children reach that stage of development. The
commission said a warning was included in the box of the crib
kicker, but was not attached to the toy, so it issued a public
reminder of the danger.

   Time Inc. shares rocketed in early trading today
in a runup sparked by a $10.7 billion takeover offer from Paramount
Communications Inc. The offer rivals a merger agreement Time has
with Warner Communications Inc.
   Time jumped $43.50 to $169.50 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange. After a delayed opening, Warner was up $1.37{ to $53.12{
and Paramount slipped 87{ cents to $53.12{.
   Paramount, the entertainment and media company formerly known as
Gulf &amp; Western Inc., announced late Tuesday a tender offer of $175 a
share cash for Time.
   The company also filed a lawsuit in Delaware, where Time is
incorporated, to block provisions of the Time-Warner agreement that
Paramount said were aimed at thwarting competing offers. But a judge
declined to immediately grant Paramount's request.
   The Paramount offer comes 2{ weeks before Time shareholders are
to vote on whether to approve the merger with Warner, a stock swap
combination that would create the world's biggest media and
entertainment company with $10 billion in annual revenue.
   Harold Vogel, who follows the entertainment industry for Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., said the Paramount bid would provoke ``a much lengthier
battle than Time and Warner had anticipated.''
   Paramount's bid is 60 percent above where Time stock was trading
before the publishing and cable giant announced in March it had
reached an agreement with Warner.
   It's also 39 percent above Time's closing price Tuesday of $126 a
share, up $2.75 from Monday's close.
   Paramount is the owner of Paramount Pictures, whose films include
the ``Crocodile Dundee,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Indiana
Jones'' series. Its TV programs include ``Cheers'' and ``Family
Ties.'' Paramount also owns publishers Simon &amp; Schuster and Pocket
Books.
   Martin S. Davis, Paramount chairman and chief executive, said a
marriage of his company and Time would create ``the foremost
American communications company, capable of competing on a global
scale against foreign media giants.''
   That's also a goal of the Time-Warner merger plan. Warner also
owns a movie and TV production companies.
   In a statement, Time said its board would review the proposal
``as required by law'' and urged its shareholders ``not to do
anything until they hear from Time.''
   A Warner spokesman said the company had no immediate comment.
   Davis said Paramount would make ``a superb business fit'' with
Time, the nation's biggest publishing company.
   ``We will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book
publishing, as well as in motion picture and television production
and distribution, cable systems and cable programming'' he said.
   Davis said Time had essentially put itself up for sale by
agreeing to merge with Warner in a deal that would wind up giving
Warner's shareholders 60 percent of the new company. Nevertheless,
Paramount said it would withdraw its offer if Time shareholders
approve the Warner transaction on June 23.
   Until Tuesday, the planned Time-Warner merger had sailed past
every potential hurdle, but speculation had persisted that a bidder
would emerge for Time, long a target of takeover rumors.
   Paramount's offer is subject to several conditions, including
obtaining financing, the elimination of Time's ``poison pill''
takeover defense, required regulatory approvals and ending a
proposed lock-up stock swap between Time and Warner.
   Paramount Communications earned $384.7 million, or $3.21 a share,
on revenue of $5.1 billion in its fiscal 1988, which ended Oct. 31.
The company also owns Madison Square Garden in New York, the New
York Knicks basketball team and New York Rangers hockey team, the
MSG cable network.
   Time earned $289 million, or $5.01 a share, on revenue of $4.5
billion in its fiscal 1988 that ended Dec. 31.
   Time publishes such titles as Time, People, Sports Illustrated
amd Fortune. It owns the book companies Scott, Foresman and Co. and
Little Brown and Co. and controls the cable programmer Home Box
Office Inc.

<HEAD>Thousands Injured During Khomeini Grieving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 11,000 people have been injured and
many have died during three days of anguished grieving for Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the government said Wednesday.
   Tens of thousands turned out for memorial service on Wednesday
for Khomeini, with many voicing support for Iran's new leader,
President Ali Khamenei.
   Carrying black flags and portraits of Khomeini, the crowds at
Tehran University chanted ``Obedience to Khamenei is obedience to
the imam of the Islamic nation.'' Iranians called Khomeini their
imam, or spiritual leader.
   Buses brought hundreds of people to the city center campus early
in the morning and streets all around were packed with people.
   The memorial service was attended by Khamenei and other leaders,
including Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi, Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili and Khomeini's son,
Ahmad.
   Cabinet ministers and ranking members of the armed forces
leadership also were present and a special section of the prayer
area was reserved for wounded veterans of the 8-year war with Iraq.
   One man, sitting in a wheelchair, said: ``We were ready to die or
the imam, but now he is dead we have nothing to live for.''
   In a renewed outpouring of grief for Khomeini, the worshippers
beat their heads with their fists in the traditional Shiite Moslem
mourning rite.
   ``The imam is in heaven today'' and ``Better we were dead and you
were here with us,'' they chanted.
   Around 100 people who collapsed in the fierce heat and crush of
the densely packed crowd were hoisted over the heads of the
worshipers and placed on stretchers for transfer to first aid
stations.
   Iran's official media said almost 11,000 people were injured in
three days of mourning since Khomeini's death on Saturday, with 438
taken to hospital.
   Tehran radio quoted an unidentified health service official as
saying ``many died'' but no figures were given. Eight people were
reported dead on Monday.
   Khomeini, 86, died in a Tehran hospital of a heart attack 11 days
after undergoing surgery May 23 for internal bleeding.
   Khamenei, considered a moderate, was voted his successor on
Sunday by 60 out of 74 experts who were handpicked by Khomeini in
the early days of the Islamic revolution to handle the succession
issue.
   But his appointment appeared a stop-gap measure to fill a
political vacuum while constitutional reforms are prepared for
approval in a referendum to be held Aug. 18.
   Iranians also will vote for a new president that day with
Khamenei, 49, barred from running for a third four-year term under
the constitution.
   The only candidate so far declared is Rafsanjani, 55, a Khamenei
ally and leader of the so-called pragmatists in the regime's
infighting between moderate and hardliners.
   But in a show of unity, the leading hardliners, Ardebili and
Musavi, joined Rafsanjani and Khamenei in issuing a joint statement
Wednesday pledging ``to work together'' and continue the
revolutionary patriarch's policies.
   The statement called on Iranians to ``close ranks even further
and watch out for probable moves and plots of the enemies'' of the
revolution.
   The state-controlled newspapers echoed that theme, calling for
obedience to Khamenei as the country's new religious leader.
Although he is only a middle-ranking clergyman, Khamenei has been
accorded the courtesy title of ``ayatollah'' in recognition of his
new status.
   The constitutional reforms ordered by Khomeini earlier this year
probably will invest the president with strong executive powers in
order to eliminate competing power centers that have slowed the
decision-making process for years.
   Thousand of mourners poured into the capital from other Iranian
cities to pray at Khomeini's grave. He was buried Tuesday amid
frenzied scenes of grief in a the Beheshte Zahra cemetery in south
Tehran beside fighters who died in the gulf war and in the 1979
revolution that brought him to power.

   A 12-year-old paperboy got fed up when a

miles off the job.
   Anthony Hilton disappeared about 6:30 p.m. Monday while he was
delivering The Hour of Norwalk newspaper.
   A fisherman found him Tuesday afternoon while he walked along a
highway in Wilton, about 10 miles from his home in Norwalk. The boy
said he had hiked through the night, occasionally taking breaks on
front porches when heavy rain fell.
   He told police he didn't know where he was going, he just wanted
to get out of Norwalk.
   Anthony said a woman on his route quibbled over her payment and
said service was better before he took over the route, said his
mother, Elaine Fletcher.
   Anthony said he plans to continue delivering newspapers, but
``not to people who give me problems.''

<HEAD>IRS Seeking $100,000 in Dispute With Former PTL Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is seeking
$100,000 in back taxes and penalties from Richard W. Dortch,
contending his $259,142 yearly salary from PTL ministries was nearly
twice what was reasonable.
   The IRS also contends that Dortch, who was second in command to
Jim Bakker at PTL, made personal use of the ministries' airplane and
failed to pay tax on bonuses and housing allowances provided by PTL.
   The dispute is over Dortch's tax return for 1984. He challenged
the IRS' assessment by filing suit in Tax Court.
   In 1984, Dortch served as co-pastor and executive director of
PTL's Heritage Village Church and Missionary Fellowship in Fort
Mill, S.C.
   According to IRS court documents, PTL paid Dortch $85,104 during
the 12 months that ended May 31, 1984, and $322,667 during the
following 12 months. The IRS calculated the compensation at $259,142
for calendar year 1984 and contended that $132,365 of that was
unreasonable for a tax-exempt church to have paid.
   Dortch disputed IRS allegations that he:
   _Should have reported as taxable income two payments totaling
$125,000 from PTL into his account with the Assemblies of God
ministers' pension plan.
   _Used PTL's plane for personal use almost 28 percent of the time,
which IRS valued at $42,888 for 1984.
   _Overstated provable contributiorly low-income housing, small business
and small farm loans.
   Martha R. Seger, one of the Fed's seven governors, said the
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings, if released publicly,
could be ``misunderstood'' as a reflection of financial soundness
and ``undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an
institution.''
   Under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits
back into lending for local needs, the Fed and other regulators now
rate banks, savings and loan associations and other deposit
institutions on a 1-to-5, best-to-worst scale.
   Like commerical examination ratings, the CRA numbers have been
treated by regulators as confidential, although on occasion they
have been used to challenge and deny a bank's application to expand.
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on
consumer affairs, Ms. Seger said the ratings were designed as a
``supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions
needing closer attention.''
   The number rating ``is in no way a self-explanatory indicator of
performance'' and can be misleading, she said.
   Nonetheless, she said, the Fed could support amending the 1977
law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each bank's
community reinvestment performance based on regulators' examinations.
   The subcommittee is considering a series of bills by Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would require publishing of the numerical
ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash
government checks of non-depositors and provide low-cost checking
accounts to the poor and elderly.
   Civil rights and community activist groups have called for the
increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years
of ``redlining'' by financial insitutions in Atlanta, New York and
Detroit.
   Redlining is practice by which banks and S&amp;Ls have used zip codes
and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of
minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness.
   ``Many lenders still don't accept an obligation to reinvest
inner-city deposits in sound inner-city loans,'' said Gale Cincotta,
executive director of the National Training and Information Center,
a Chicago-based group that helps local organizations pressure banks
for CRA lending.
   Cincotta said the entire rating system lacks credibility because
the Fed and other regulators already give 1 and 2 _ excellent or
good _ ratings to 95 percent of the institutions.
   ``Disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this
credibility gap, and make it that much more likely that regulators
would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system,''
Cincotta said.
   Trade association lobbyists have opposed Metzenbaum's bill,
citing the arguments raised by both Ms. Seger and Cincotta as well
as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert
pressure for granting unsound loans.
   Metzenbaum tried to add the measures to President Bush's S&amp;L
bailout bill when it was considered by the Senate in April but
withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition.
   The banking subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
endorsed elements of Metzenbaum's proposal Wednesday but said he
also was sympathetic to the arguments made by Ms. Seger against
disclosing the numerical ratings.

   As many as 400 wild horses and 200 deer have
been found shot to death and covered with dirt near here,
authorities said.
   Undersheriff Harry Collins said Tuesday the carcasses were found
in a remote area, including a private ranch, over several months.
The shootings apparently began in October and continued into March,
authorities said.
   No arrests have been made. A federal grand jury is investigating.
   Last fall, more than 500 mustangs were found slaughtered in
Nevada about 200 miles from here. Two men go on trial in federal
court Tuesday in some of the deaths. Three others face trial in July.
   Killing deer is a state offense, punishable by a year in jail.
Killing wild horses is against federal law and carries up to a year
in prison and a $2,000 fine.

   President Bush will hold his first prime-time
televised news conference in the East Room of the White House at 8
p.m. EDT Thursday, it was announced today.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the session
might well go beyond the 30 minutes usually alloted for presidential
news conferences. He said Bush is ``a president who has trouble
confining himself to 30 minutes'' in question-and-answer sessions.
   In his 4{ months in office, Bush has had numerous press
conferences, most of them on short notice in the White House press
briefing room. Fitzwater said there have been 16 to 23 press
conferences, depending on how they're counted.

   A Suriname Airways jetliner flying
from the Netherlands with 182 people aboard crashed and tore apart
today near the capital's international airport, killing 168 people,
the airline said.
   The Suriname News Agency said the DC-8 went down about 4:30 a.m.
(3:30 a.m. EDT) about two miles from Zanderij International Airport.
   Airline spokesman Robbi Lachmising told reporters in Amsterdam
that the plane crashed in dense fog. The airport has no radar,
Lachmising said.
   The Suriname News Agency said three of the nation's top military
officers were on the flight and identified them as army chief of
staff Maj. Raymond Lieuw Yen Tai, air force commander Maj. Eddy Djoe
and army chief of operations Capt. Armand Salomons. All were
presumed dead, it said.
   The plane had been carrying 173 passengers and nine crewmembers,
Lachmising said. He said 168 people died.
   He said the 14 survivors were rushed to Paramaribo's university
hospital, but their identities and condition were not immediately
known.
   The airline said the plane was flown by Americans and identified
them as Capt. Will Rogers, pilot Glyn Tobias and engineer Rose
Warren, all full-time employees of Suriname Airways. Their hometowns
and fates were not immediately known.
   The 20-year-old plane, which was registered in the United States,
broke into four pieces but did not explode, and no fire broke out,
Lachmising said.
   But Suriname radio reports quoted nearby residents as saying they
heard an explosion shortly before the plane hit the ground. A U.S.
pilot in another airplane, who was not identified, was quoted as
saying he saw a ball of fire.
   Reporters who visited the scene saw burned bodies and wreckage
scattered over a wide area.
   Lachmising said ``the accident was not caused by the plane's
technical condition.'' There were no immediate reports on what
caused the crash.
   The airline spokesman said the jetliner, leased by Suriname
Airways from an unidentified U.S. company, was extensively
overhauled in Luxembourg about 10 days ago.
   Flight PY764, which took off late Tuesday from Amsterdam's
Schiphol Airport, tried three times to land at Suriname's airport,
about 15 miles south of the capital, airline spokesman Leo Marapin
said in Amsterdam. The weather was ``extremely bad'' and on the
third attempt the jet hit a treetop, he said.
   At least three passengers were top Dutch soccer players of
Surinamese origin, according to Inter Football, a Dutch organization
for professional soccer players. They were to participate in a
national tournament in Suriname, a former Dutch colony on the
northern coast of South America.
   Inter Football spokesman Nico Snijders identified the three as
Orwin Linger, Lloyd Doesburg and Fred Patrick _ all of the
Netherlands. He said initially there were four players on the
airplane but later corrected the number.
   A passenger list was not immediately available, but airline
spokesman Glenn Jie in Amsterdam said most of those on board were
Surinamese people living in the Netherlands.
   At Suriname Airways' downtown office in Amsterdam, dozens of
weeping relatives gathered to wait for news.
   Suriname, a nation of about 300,000, gained independence from the
Netherlands in 1975. About 200,000 Surinamese live in the
Netherlands.
   Wet terrain from recent rains hampered rescue efforts, the
Suriname agency said.
   Lachmising said a Surinamese army unit on maneuvers near the
crash site administered first aid to the survivors.
   Police, soldiers, and medical personnel went to the crash site,
which was sealed off to civilians. State radio said victims were
brought to hospitals in Paramaribo throughout the morning.

   A House subcommittee voted Wednesday to
subpoena a Reagan administration housing official who has refused to
help in an investigation of alleged contracting irregularities in
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing voted unanimously to subpoena Deborah Dean, who was
executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce in 1982-87.
   The position of assistant secretary of housing turned over
frequently during the Pierce years, but Ms. Dean was there through
most of his term, said Celia Boddington, staff member for the
subcommittee headed by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   The subcommittee is investigating allegations that well-connected
Republicans were favored in a federal subsidy program for low-income
housing construction.
   James Watt, who served as interior secretary under President
Reagan, has agreed to testify Friday about his role, after leaving
office, as a consultant to a developer who got one of the subsidy
contracts.
   The developer, Judith Siegel, president of Landex Corp., has
testified that Watt helped her get a contract for a 312-unit project
in Essex, Md., under the federal government's Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The subcommittee said Watt was paid $300,000 for his services.
   HUD said June 1 it was resuming subsidies, under new rules, for
the rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by low-income and
moderate-income families.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp had suspended the program in April after
the department's inspector general reported it had been mismanaged
and riddled with favortism for former high-ranking Republicans
serving as consultants to developers.
   On May 25, Pierce, who headed HUD through the Reagan presidency,
defended his role in the subsidy program, saying he tried to kill it.
   Pierce told the subcommittee that department officials used their
discretion in awarding subsidies to selected developers but that was
because Congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-share
allocation practices.

   He will spend the night in a lodge near Jackson Hole, Wyo., and
speak Tuesday morning at the Teton Science School.
   The trip is designed to showcase Bush's clean air package.
   His measure, still in the final stages of preparation, is
expected to propose tighter standards for emissions that cause acid
rain and for more strictly controlling auto exhaust emissions.

   Police say they caught a modern-day ``sodbuster''
mud-handed with 27 rolls of stolen sod in the front and back seats
of his car.
   Donald Spearman, 39, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
stealing newly laid turf from a parkway, police said.
   Spearman, who had been doing landscaping in a Chicago suburb,
told police he had bought the sod, said Capt. Richard Wedgbury. But
a witness reported seeing him remove the turf early Tuesday, police
said.
   Moreover, police said they made Spearman put the sod back and it
fit perfectly into the blank spots along the parkway.
   Officers said they knew they had their man because he was covered

   Before toxic chemicals from the Avtex
Fibers plant seeped into the wells of homes across the Shenandoah
River, William Poland's house was part of a neighborhood.
   The neighbors are gone.
   Poland and his wife are the only residents left in the Rivermont
Acres subdivision, living alone on a dirt road that cuts through
fields between cement blocks where other houses once stood.
   At the entrance to the road, a home-made sign reads ``Entering
Water Pollution Area.''
   The Polands' ranch house was one of a dozen small homes with back
yards slanting down to the river, lined with trees that in
summertime blocked the view of the 65-acre rayon plant on the
opposite bank.
   Avtex Fibers Inc. bought up most of the subdivision five years
ago, when tests showed that groundwater had been contaminated by
viscose and sulfate bases from the plant's holding ponds. But the
purchases stopped short of Poland's house, the furthest upstream
from the plant, because it is outside the contaminated zone, the
company says.
   Poland said many of the former residents of the subdivision have
died of cancer, and he is worried about his and his wife's health.
He'd like to sell the house and move, he said, but most real estate
agents won't touch the property.
   ``I'm stuck and I know it,'' he said. ``They don't have to do
anything about it. What makes me so mad is they knowingly endangered
the lives of everyone down here. They don't do anything unless
they're forced to do it.''
   The Avtex holding ponds haven't been used since the contamination
was discovered and the Environmental Protection Agency declared the
area a cleanup site in 1984 under the industry-financed Superfund
law, said Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols. But pollution of the
groundwater and the river has continued, state officials say.
   At a hearing last week on the plant's violations of state water
pollution limits, state and Avtex officials alike described the
50-year-old plant as leaking chemicals through its floors and
deteriorated sewer systems.
   Richmond Circuit Judge T.J. Markow is considering a state
proposal to fine Avtex $140,000 for violating its agreement to
comply with state water discharge limits.
   From the other side of the river, few of the aging plant's
problems are visible, except an occasional patch of white gleaming
on the river bottom and a cloudy brown plume of water spewing into
the green river further downstream.
   Poland, 49, worked for Avtex for 17 years until quitting in 1981.
He says the first sign of a problem in Rivermont Acres came in 1968,
when a neighbor dug a well and found a smelly green substance at the
bottom.
   The discovery led to more than a decade of official inquiries and
tests of water in the subdivision.
   Meanwhile, Poland started bringing in his own drinking water in
1972, when his water started tasting bad.
   ``It smelled like sulfur,'' he said. At the same time, he started
itching and having skin problems.
   ``The dog scratched for a week after a bath,'' he added. ``He
don't imagine things.''
   In October 1981, the county health department advised residents
that ``the well water in this area could be potentially hazardous to
your health and you should not drink it.''
   Wells in the area had been found to be contaminated with
chromium, arsenic, cadmium, carbon disulfide and phenols, the
department said.
   After the area was declared a Superfund site in 1984, Avtex
offered to purchase all the plots in the subdivision except Poland's.
   ``Mr. Poland's property is not within the contamination area,''
Nichols said. ``In July 1984 Avtex did an analysis of his well that
proved to be standard for the area.''
   After Poland complained to the company of itching after showers,
Nichols said Avtex agreed to provide him with water ``as a matter of
courtesy.''
   Poland said Avtex built him a 6,000 gallon reservoir at a cost of
$8,000 and refills it each month.
   Tests have showed trace amounts of various chemicals in his
groundwater, but Poland says officials have told him it's not
Avtex-related.
   Poland says he's resigned to staying at Rivermont Acres. And if
the Avtex plant closes, as he expects it will, he'll go back to
buying his own drinking water.
   ``I'm just fed up with the area,'' he said. ``It's peaceful in
the summertime, but it's lonely as hell down here in the wintertime.
You don't see nobody.''

<HEAD>Rice Says Don't Hike Midgetman Funds By Cutting Money for Other Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice cautioned
members of Congress Wednesday against increasing funds for the
land-based Midgetman missile by cutting money for other military
programs.
   ``It's simply unnecessary. There is no reason for an increase in
1990 funds,'' Rice told the Senate Appropriations defense
subcommittee. He responded to questions from subcommittee Chairman
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, about congressional opposition to spending
levels for land-based nuclear weapons.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed a fiscal 1990 defense
budget that includes $1.2 billion for the multiple-warhead MX
missile, with the existing 50 missiles to be moved from silos to
railroad cars by 1992, and $100 million for research and development
of the single-warhead Midgetman.
   Democrats who favor the Midgetman have criticized the small
amount of money earmarked for it while Republicans who support the
MX missile believe the $100 million for the smaller ICBM is a waste
of funds.
   Last month, some lawmakers said they would introduce an amendment
to the defense authorization bill to eliminate money for the
Midgetman, and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., estimated that ``upward
of 250'' House members would back the plan.
   ``How strongly would you object if Congress increases the funds
for the smaller ICBM at the expense of other Air Force programs?''
Inouye asked Rice.
   ``There is no reason,'' said the Air Force secretary, describing
the planned budget amount for the Midgetman as adequate.
   On another Air Force program, Rice was pleased by Cheney's recent
assessment of the B-2 stealth bomber. The defense secretary had said
he needed more time to study the bomber before deciding on whether
it was worth buying. But after a visit last week to the Northrop
plant in Palmdale, Calif., where the bomber is built, Cheney said
that despite the increasing costs, the bomber is worth purchasing.
   Robert Costello, the Pentagon's former undersecretary for
acquisition, had recommended canceling the bomber which recent
estimates indicate will cost more than $500 million apiece.
   Inouye said his colleagues in Congress have used the total price
tag for the fleet of B-2s _ estimated at more than $15 billion _ as
``raw meat for political speeches.''
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force's chief of staff, responded
that the bomber is ``uniquely qualified to cover a wide range of
targets'' and its development will make it a prototype for future
generations of aircraft.
   Welch also argued that the bomber is a good buy, noting that the
B-1 bomber was 160 percent more than the B-52 while the B-2 is only
a 22 percent increase over the B-1.
   On another topic, Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a member of the
panel, questioned Welch about the quality of the South Korean Air
Force and whether U.S. forces estimated at more than 40,000 troops
and a handful of Air Force squadrons could be withdrawn as a
cost-saving measure.
   ``Our presence there is not worth the $2 billion we're spending
to stay there,'' said Bumpers, who argued that South Korea's high
gross national product and strong armed forces makes the nation
qualified to take care of itself.
   ``We are still an important part of the stability,'' Welch said.
   Rice urged lawmakers to be careful about the cost issue, saying
it cost less to keep the U.S. forces in South Korea than to bring
them back to the United States.

   A young woman wanted to tell the invading soldiers
they were unwelcome in her city. Thinking they wouldn't shoot a
woman, she walked fearlessly toward their lines.
   They fired. She fell. A bullet wound turned her white shirt
scarlet.
   A stranger ran to her body. Bullets ricocheted by his feet as he
hauled her onto his back and carried her toward safety. The woman,
bleeding heavily from a chest wound, was loaded onto the platform of
a bicycle pedicab and taken to a hospital.
   The incident Sunday on Tiananmen Square is one of thousands of
heroic acts that have marked the public's response to the five-day
martial law crackdown in Beijing.
   From moments of great courage to ones of quiet defiance, the
people of China's capital have shown they will not soon capitulate
to the army's brutal occupation. Troops continue to fire automatic
weapons into unarmed but unyielding crowds.
   ``The people of Beijing will not die,'' said a worker as he stood
watching troops on Tiananmen Square Wednesday. ``The people will be
victorious.''
   To stop soldiers from ripping their way into the city's center
Saturday night and Sunday morning, citizens lay down their lives in
front of trucks and tanks.
   At one point, a young man in a white shirt stopped a line of
tanks as they rolled out of Tiananmen Square onto Changan Jie, the
city's main boulevard whose name means the Avenue of Eternal Peace.
   Placing his arm up and palm out like a traffic policeman, the
defiant youth stood gallantly in front of the tanks.
   As the lead tank moved right, he moved right. As it moved left,
he did as well. Astonished onlookers first cheered and then ran out
onto the street to rescue the man as the military convoy prepared to
run him down.
   ``Only the people can do things like that,'' said an elderly man,
who witnessed the incident. ``It shows our power.''
   On street corners throughout the city, groups huddled together
retell episodes of singular bravery.
   At the Muxudi intersection on Saturday, machine-gun fire hit a
middle-aged man in the back, sending him sprawling. Bullets whipped
about his body. Tear gas cannisters exploded overhead.
   Zhao Min brought his bicycle-pedicab to the middle of the road,
picked up the wounded man and brought him to safety.
   ``He was down and needed someone,'' said the 19-year-old after he
returned from bringing the man to a nearby hospital. ``There's no
time to think now about why. These are fascist troops invading my
city. He's a defender so he's my brother.''
   At the Beijing Radio station on Sunday, an announcer broadcasting
on the English-language service read a report that troops had killed
thousands of people, mostly innocent victims.
   ``Please remember June the 3rd, 1989, the most tragic event
happened in the Chinese capital Beijing. Thousands of people, most
of them innocent civilians, were killed by fully-armed soldiers.''
   The maverick announcer was replaced by a man who repeated the
Communist Party's approved version of events.
   Residents of the city soon learned of this last incident of
objective reporting from foreign radio reports beamed to Beijing.
   In recent days, as fighting has grown more sporadic, the acts of
bravery have taken on a different character.
   Citizens escort foreign reporters past lines of troops, defying
martial law orders prohibiting communication with foreign
journalists. Many residents wear black armbands, mourning the dead.
   Daily, throughout the city, the military stages armed assaults
against demonstrators crowding intersections. As soon as the troops
withdraw, the people surge back into the street and reclaim the
territory.
   At the corner of one avenue, a sculpture of a dancing girl has
been turned into an makeshift memorial for the dead that fell nearby.
   A banner, reading ``Return the blood debt with blood,'' hangs
from her neck, a black band wrapped around her arm.
   Paper chrysanthemums, the flower traditionally used in Chinese
wakes, are scattered over the shrine. A child's drawing shows a
soldier riding atop a firing tank, a swastika painted on its side.
   ``The people's army attacks the people,'' reads the caption. ``My
sister died and I will never forget.''

<TEXT>
   Giving clean needles and syringes to drug addicts
does not promote drug use and is essential for stopping the
explosive spread of AIDS among narcotics abusers, a researcher said
Wednesday.
   And, in a strikingly upbeat assessment, a leading U.S. health
official who pioneered the first anti-AIDS drugs predicted that a
cure for AIDS will be found.
   ``In the early 50s and 60s, there were many people who predicted
there would be no progress against childhood leukemia. They were as
wrong then as they are about AIDS now,'' said Dr. Samuel Broder,
director of the National Cancer Institute.
   In an address at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS,
Broder noted that AZT, the first approved anti-AIDS drug, has
extended the lives of people with AIDS.
   A study of homosexual men showed that they had a 30 percent
chance of surviving for 18 months with AIDS in 1982, but a 60
percent chance by 1987.
   ``I believe the widespread introduction of AZT is one factor that
contributed to this,'' Broder said. He directed the development of
AZT, also known as zidovudine.
   In another report Wednesday, researchers at Johns Hopkins
University said they eliminated any trace of the AIDS virus in a
single AIDS patient who was given AZT and a transplant of bone
marrow from a sister whose bone marrow type matched his.
   The experiment showed that bone marrow transplants could work in
AIDS patients. Such treatment is unlikely ever to become widely
available, however, because matching bone marrow can not always be
found and because transplants are too expensive to be done on a
large number of patients.
   Despite being cleansed of the AIDS virus, the patient died of
cancer six weeks after the transplant.
   The study on drug addicts was reported by Dr. Roel Coutinho of
the public health service in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
   Amsterdam began providing needles to its addicts in 1984. Addicts
spread AIDS by sharing needles and syringes, either because that is
a customary practice or because needles and syringes are in short
supply.
   Needle exchanges _ in which clean needles and syringes would be
swapped for used needles and syringes _ were proposed to help stop
sharing. Critics feared that such programs would encourage drug
abuse.
   ``There is no evidence that the needle exchange increased
intravenous drug use,'' Coutinho said. Sharing of needles among some
addicts dropped from 56 percent of addicts to 16 percent in one
study, Coutinho said.
   ``Apparely intravenous drug users are able to change their
behavior,'' he said, if needles are available and if the addicts are
given intensive counselling about AIDS and how it can be prevented.
   ``I think that providing needles and syringes is absolutely
necessary,'' he said.
   Amsterdam has only about 8,000 intravenous drug abusers, Coutinho
said, making it much different from New York City, for example,
where there are about 200,000. It is not clear, therefore, whether
the lessons learned in Amsterdam would apply in New York.
   Preliminary results from a study of a recently begun needle
exchange program in New York showed that drug abusers were less
likely to share their needles and syringes and were more likely to
clean them with bleach, which kills the AIDS virus.
   Don Des Jarlais of the New York State Division of Substance Abuse
Services concluded that the program was substantially reducing the
risk of AIDS spread among addicts.
   A study in London showed, however, that needle sharing fell when
needles were provided, but that some addicts also stopped using
condoms to prevent sexual spread of AIDS, and the incidence of AIDS
infection among the addicts increased.
   In San Francisco, needle sharing declined after an exchange
program was started but 30 percent of the study's participants
continued to share needles despite the best efforts of the program's
organizers.

   Two National Guard M-1 tanks collided at
Fort Harrison today, killing one driver and seriously injuring the
other, officials said.
   Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly said one of the 60-ton Abrams battle tanks
ended up on top of the other, causing severe damage to both.
   Authorities said the drivers were National Guard employees
performing technical checks on the recently arrived $1.8 million
tanks. The accident occurred before 9 a.m. on a flat, open training
ground, O'Reilly said.
   The cause was under investigation.
   The injured man was hospitalized in Helena, O'Reilly said.
   The M-1 has been used by the active Army since 1982. It has a
four-person crew and a top speed of 45 mph and fires a 105mm cannon.
   The Montana Army National Guard received 120 of the tanks during
the winter as part of the reorganization of Montana's 163rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment into a brigade, a larger unit with different duties.
   Guard units in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia also
use the M-1.

   A federal judge on Wednesday gave short
sentences in halfway houses to the first two defendants convicted in
the Pentagon corruption investigation and said their trial had
revealed purchasing practices that let consultants ``live a
parasitic life off the government.''
   ``I can't believe our government, the Congress and executive,
lets a system like this endure,'' U.S. District Judge Richard L.
Williams said in passing sentence on George H. Kaub and Eugene R.
Sullivan, vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of San Diego.
   Kaub was given concurrent sentences of one year each on eight
counts of conspiracy, wire fraud and false statements. All but six
months of the term was suspended.
   Sullivan drew concurrent sentences of one year each on one count
of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud, with all but three
months of the sentence suspended.
   The judge directed that the two serve their time in halfway
houses so that both men can continue to work. They have been on
leave from their jobs.
   Berkeley Baker, assistant to the president for public relations
at Teledyne Industries Inc., the parent company of the electronics
subsidiary, said by telephone from Los Angeles that he understood
federal law prevented a defense contractor from employing a
convicted felon. However, he said, the company ``will want to do the
humanistic thing'' and would study the judge's ruling.
   After completing their time, Kaub and Sullivan will be on
probation for two years with orders to do 200 hours of unspecified
community service.
   Kaub was fined $30,000.
   Sullivan was not fined. His lawyer told the court that Sullivan
had no assets except a small equity in a house he bought last year
with a Veterans Administration loan.
   Kaub could have been sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined $2
million; Sullivan, 20 years and $1 million.
   ``This trial was a window to Defense Department procurement
procedures,'' Williams said. ``Those procedures are so outrageous
that a world of so-called consultants, and as far as I am concerned
that is another word for rogue, are permitted to live a parasitic
life off the government,'' the judge said.
   A jury found the two guilty in April of participating in a scheme
to hire defense consultant William L. Parkin, who, in turn, bribed a
Navy official to obtain inside information that would help Teledyne
get a $24 million contract for hand-held radar-detection kits.
   Parkin pleaded guilty to bribery charges. Both he and Stuart E.
Berlin, a former Navy engineer who pleaded guilty to receiving
nearly $5,000 in bribes from Parkin, were sentenced to 26 months in
prison last week.
   Williams said a halfway house in the San Diego area is expected
to have an opening within 30 days and the men will remain free until
then. He gave Sullivan until Aug. 2 to surrender so that he could
attend his daughter's wedding July 29.
   Charges against a third Teledyne defendant who stood trial, Dale
Schnittjer, were dismissed after jurors were unable to reach a
verdict in his case.
   A dozen other individuals and two corporations, including
Teledyne Industries Inc., have pleaded guilty in connection with the
Justice Department's ``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of
military purchasing fraud.
   Teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false
statements. The company, based in Newbury Park, Calif., has paid
$4.3 million in penalties and fines.

   President Bush was ``disgusted'' by a
Republican document that labeled House Speaker Tom Foley a closet
liberal, Bush's spokesman said today. The author of the memo,
meantime, resigned his party post.
   Bush called Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National
Committee, to complain about the incident and Atwater apologized to
Foley, said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We consider the matter closed,'' he added.
   Meanwhile, Mark Goodin, the author of the memo that equated
Foley's voting record with that of Rep. Barney Frank, an
acknowledged homosexual, resigned today as RNC communications
director.
   Goodin was a press assistant in Bush's 1988 presidential campaign.
   Fitzwater said Bush, who had a 90-minute lunch today with Foley
and House Republican Leader Bob Michel, had no advance knowledge of
the Goodin memo.
   ``He was disgusted by this entire incident,'' the spokesman said.
He said the memo seeking to discredit Foley, D-Wash., violated the
spirit of bipartisan cooperation that Bush has advocated since
taking office.
   ``The issue is closed,'' Foley said outside the White House.
   Michel, R-Ill., told reporters, ``There wasn't all the kind of
oversight there probably should have been'' at the RNC. ``It was a
mistake obviously from the national committee's point of view.''
   Michel said he did not know if Goodin had been asked to resign.
Asked what advice he gave Atwater, he said: ``I just said, `There's
got to be some remedy for what took place, and Lee, it's your shot.
Do whatever you think is appropriate.''
   Fitzwater said the circulation of the GOP memo on Foley was ``to
be deplored.'' However, he said the president retains confidence in
Atwater, his former campaign chairman whom he handpicked for the
party post.
   ``I deeply regret my decision on the Foley memorandum,'' Goodin
said in a resignation letter to Atwater. But, he added: ``At no time
did I ever intend to damage anyone's reputation ... the purpose of
the memorandum has been misconstrued. And in that regard, I have no
one to blame but myself.''
   He said the memo was sent out without Atwater's ``knowledge or
approval.''
   Foley said at his first daily news conference as speaker today
that Atwater telephoned him late Tuesday and was ``deeply apologetic
for any inferences of personal character,''
   ``He repudiated the statement and apologized ... I accepted
that,'' said Foley. ``It's regrettable, and entirely untrue of
course. I think the matter is now at an end.''
   Foley said Atwater promised such attacks would not be repeated
and added, ``I know of no reason why he won't keep that promise.''
   Foley, sworn in as speaker on Tuesday in place of a
scandal-scarred Jim Wright, also quoted Atwater as saying he
regretted any inference that the political attack was ``personal.''
   Michel, who had expressed dismay over the attack on Tuesday,
called Bush today to voice concern, and the president was angry
about the document, according to a Michel aide.
   One Democratic leader, Rep. Tony Coelho of California, said Bush
should get involved and see that those responsible for the document
are fired if Republicans want to persuade Democrats of their
sincerity.
   ``They're playing good cop, bad cop,'' Coelho said before the
resignation was announced. ``Here's a a guy sent in by Bush to do
the dirty deeds, and he calls and apologizes after the fact. If
they're really upset about these tactics, all they have to do is
fire somebody.''
   In the statement circulated Monday, the committee said Foley was
anything but the political moderate some have portrayed him as
being. The document was headlined ``Tom Foley. Out of the Liberal
Closet'' and said Foley's voting record was as liberal as that of
Frank, D-Mass.
   While Foley initially refused to respond to the political
broadside, some Democrats in Congress expressed fury and Michel, the
top Republican in the House, swiftly moved to distance himself from
it.
   Frank accused the GOP of spreading ``extraordinarily scurrilous''
rumors about Foley. He said Tuesday that the Republicans had smeared
the speaker with ``a sleazy headline.''
   Frank implied to reporters that he thought the RNC's decision to
focus on him was a not-so-subtle effort to portray Foley as gay.
   ``They put my name on it,'' Frank said. ``It was despicable. They
could have picked other liberals and put someone else in the
headline.'' Frank said he might reveal the identity of gay
congressional Republicans if the attacks on Democrats continued.
   He added: ``The ludicrous part is that effort to make Tom Foley
look like an unreasoning partisan. It's kind of like trying to make
a snowman dance.''
   Foley initially shrugged off the attack, saying, ``I'm not
concerned about political action committees. I want to work with the
president, work with the leadership of Congress.''
   At a breakfast with reporters a few hours before Goodin quit,
Edward Rollins, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, said Goodin had erred seriously.
   ``Sometimes you get a little too cute and obviously this is
something that blew up in his face,'' Rollins said. ``If I thought
it had gone on in my own committee, I would fire the person.''
   Goodin earlier defended his work. ``It was not a smear,'' he
said. ``It has to do with his (Foley's) liberal voting record.''
   But Michel said staffers ``do not speak for the Republican
Party,'' and ``on occasion they deal in excesses.''
   Frank also referred to a column in the New York Daily News that
quoted an unnamed aide to the House Republican Whip, Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, as spreading rumors about Foley.
   Said Frank, ``It's part of a pattern where they don't have
anything of any substance to use against people to try and use
innuendo and rumor.''

   Lawyers for the Bible Speaks Church
cited principles of religious freedom in asking the U.S. Supreme
Court to overturn a multimillion-dollar award to an heiress who
claimed she was duped into donating money to the fundamentalist sect.
   The church contended in its request for review, filed Monday,
that the issues raised by the case posed a threat to all religious
communities, especially those whose ``non-mainstream character
renders them particularly vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding,
both conscious and unconscious.''
   ``You can't unscramble so-called `possible secular components'
(for making a donation) from a combination of reasons, most of which
are religous, without offending the Constitution,'' said Norman Roy
Grutman, a church attorney.
   Elizabeth Dovydenas of Lenox maintained the Lenox-based church's
leader, Carl H. Stevens, conned her into donating $6.6 million to
the church in 1984 and 1985. She left the church in 1985.
   A federal appeals court found in March that her first donations
had been freely given and should not be returned. But it upheld
lower court rulings ordering the return of $5.5 million in
subsequent gifts.
   ``Those who run (the church) may freely exercise their religion,
but they cannot use the cloak of religion to exert undue influence
of a non-religious nature with impunity,'' Justice Hugh Bownes wrote
in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals decision.
   The case was first heard in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after the
church petitioned for Chapter 11 protection, maintaining that Mrs.
Dovydenas' claim could force it into insolvency. After a judge ruled
in her behalf and a trustee was appointed to oversee the church's
headquarters, church leaders and dozens of followers abruptly moved
out of the former prep school in Lenox. Many have since settled in
the Baltimore area.
   The property eventually was sold to Mrs. Dovydenas for $3.5
million at a bankruptcy auction. She has told town officials that
she plans to turn part of it into a community center.

<TEXT>
   Seven weeks after an explosion in a gun
turret killed 47 crewmen, the battleship USS Iowa left the Norfolk
Naval Station on Wednesday for a six-month cruise to the
Mediterranean Sea.
   Many of its 1,500 crewmen, wearing dress whites, lined the rails
when the World War II battleship pulled away and several dozen
relatives cried, waved and hugged each other on the pier.
   ``I don't want him to go out. I don't want him to go to the ship,
much less go out,'' said Lucrecia Hester, wife of Iowa crewman
Robert Hester, cradling their 8-month-old son, Cobi.
   Mrs. Hester and other relatives said they are worried the ship
might not be safe since Navy investigators have yet to determine why
the explosion occurred April 19 during a training exercise in the
Atlantic Ocean.
   ``It's scary,'' said Cherrie Todd, wife of Iowa seaman Ernest
Todd. ``You don't know what to expect.''
   Mrs. Todd said her husband would like to transfer off the
battleship. But other crewmen were looking forward to the cruise,
relatives said.
   Gary Jones came with his wife and two daughters from Knoxville,
Tenn., to say goodbye to his son, David, who is making his first
lengthy deployment.
   ``He's excited. We're excited for him,'' Gary Jones said.
   He said his son had talked little about the explosion. ``I think
he's gone through the whole ordeal real good,'' he said. ``We didn't
ask him too many questions.''
   Cindy Jagel, wife of an Iowa crewman, said she was not concerned
about the ship's safety. ``It doesn't seem to be anything that would
happen again,'' she said.
   The damaged No. 2 turret has been cleaned and painted and will be
used during the voyage to train crewmen who replaced the dead
sailors, said Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, a ship spokesman.
   But the 16-inch guns in that turret and the ship's other two
turrets will not be fired until the Navy completes its
investigation. Speculation on the cause of the blast has centered on
faulty gunpowder, inadequate training and a crewman who may have set
the blast to commit suicide. Shipboard work on the investigation has
been completed, the Navy said.
   The damaged turret will undergo $13 million in repairs when the
ship returns from the Mediterranean.
   The ship still can use its five-inch guns and surface-to-surface
missiles, Goforth said.

   Democrats and Republicans alike are flocking
to join the Barbara Bush Fan Club, formed to honor the ``Silver
Fox'' by a man who says he likes the first lady's style.
   Letters from nearly 1,500 people hailing Bush for her no-frills,
shoot-from-the-lip style have arrived at KGO-TV since a reporter
announced the start of the club.
   ``As cliche as it sounds, she's got a spunk that reminds me of my
mother,'' said founder Russ Alley, who appears on the station's
``Good Morning, Bay Area.''
   ``I've never joined or started a fan club before,'' said Alley.
``But the woman has her own style. She's honest and
straightforward.''
   Alley, a Democrat, said the club is strictly non-partisan, the
membership evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.
   The 63-year-old first lady demonstrated the charm that attracted
Alley last week when she broke into ``I'm a Little Teapot,''
complete with spout gesture, during a visit to a day care center in
Brixton, a poor area of south London.
   Most of the letters KGO has received mention Mrs. Bush's
down-to-earth manner.
   ``I especially like the fact that although she loves her husband,
she doesn't adore and fawn all over him,'' wrote Edwina Wagner, a
Petaluma, Calif., rancher.
   Rochester, N.Y., resident Harriet Riley said she joined the club
after she read about it in a newspaper.
   ``I think she's very down to earth and she's not afraid to talk
up,'' Riley said in a telephone interview. ``I'm 81 years old and I
can't remember any first lady I've liked so much.''
   ``Good Morning, Bay Area'' has begun broadcasting segments
inspired by Mrs. Bush, such as ``Silver-Fox Fashions,'' ``Grey and
Proud,'' and one piece that pointed out that more than half the
women in the United States are size 12 or larger.
   Although the show sent a tape of the first on-the-air fan club
meeting to the first lady's press secretary, Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush
has not commented on it publicly.

   Solidarity plans to support progressive
communist candidates in the June 18 runoff elections to build on its
already stunning success in parliamentary elections, spokesmen said
Wednesday.
   Communist officials, stung by their widespread rejection in
Poland's freest elections since 1947, have been pushing Solidarity
to join some sort of governing coalition with the party.
   The independent trade union has so far refused, saying it prefers
to keep its freedom to criticize government policies. But its
electoral dominance has severely undermined the authority of the
communists and left questions about their ability to govern.
   The murky political situation following Sunday's election was
expected to be the No. 1 topic Thursday when representatives of the
two sides, led by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, meet in Warsaw.
   Official voting results were expected to be issued either
Wednesday night or Thursday, according to the official news agency
PAP. The party has already conceded a ``decided'' defeat.
   Solidarity was limited by a political deal it struck with
authorities in April to run for only 35 percent, or 161, of the 460
seats in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament.
   Solidarity says it already has won 160 of those seats, and that
the remaining seat should be sealed up in the June 18 runoffs for
candidates who failed to win 50 percent of the vote, the union said.
   But in most cases the candidates of the communist party and its
allies, who ran for the remaining 299 Sejm seats, did not obtain the
requisite 50 percent in the first round of voting and will have to
participate in the second round.
   This gives Solidarity the opportunity to choose among the
communist and allied candidates those who most nearly agree with
Solidarity's program.
   ``Our opinion is that it is worthwhile to get engaged in the
second round in order to present to our voters candidates who, in
out estimation, are better candidates,'' Warsaw campaign chief Jan
Litynski told a news conference in the capital.
   ``We want to give all the candidates a chance to present their
platforms to our voters and we will probably arrange meetings'' to
discuss qualifications of the official side's candidates, he said.
   The meetings would be between the already elected Solidarity
deputies and those hopefuls still in the running for the communist
party or the allied Peasant and Democratic party seats, he said.
   Litynski noted that in Sunday's elections some communist-backed
candidates already had shown they were more popular with voters than
others, and that Solidarity would help make such people more widely
known.
   Endorsement by Solidarity was virtually tantamount to being
elected in the first round. If the same holds true June 18,
Solidarity could be able to determine nearly the entire makeup of
the Sejm.
   According to its unofficial tally, Solidarity already has won 92
of the possible 100 Senate seats and its candidates who must enter
the runoffs generally were the highest vote getters in their
districts. After the runoffs, it appeared possible the union would
hold all 100 seats.
   Still undecided is what to do about the 35 seats reserved for
prominent communist and government officials who were allowed to run
opposed. All the candidates had to do was win 50 percent of the
vote, but voters reportedly have overwhelmingly rejected them.
   Litynski and national Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz
shed little light at the news conference on the progress of talks to
determine how to fill those seats that are expected to be vacant.
   According to Solidarity, among the defeated is Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and six
other members on the ruling 17-member Politburo.
   Solidarity has promised to allow the party to fill the seats even
though its candidates were defeated. Under the April accord that
made the elections possible and resulted in Solidarity's
legalization, Solidarity ceded 65 percent of the Sejm to the
communists and their affiliated groups.
   Solidarity and government representatives held informal talks
Tuesday on the issue, but nothing was resolved and the union says it
still awaits the government's proposed solutions.
   Onyszkiewicz said Kiszczak and Walesa would discuss it further at
Thursday's full meeting of the Arbitration Commission, a panel set
up to resolve any conflicts between the government and opposition
stemming from their historic accord that liberalized Poland's
election process.
   ``We will learn there what are the possibilities for solving this
problem,'' Onyszkiewicz said.

   Troops raked a diplomatic compound with gunfire
today as military convoys drove through the capital, sending more
foreigners fleeing Beijing in fear of open urban warfare.
   The U.S. embassy's chief of security said bullets flew through
the window into a room where his two children were watching
television.
   Later, the state Department in Washington ordered the evacuation
from China of all U.S. diplomatic dependents and non-essential
government personnel, and urged all other Americans ``to leave at
once.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the United
States was chartering commercial aircraft to fly to Beijing and
Shanghai for flights out on Thursday.
   About 125 U.S. dependents were to leave on one flight, the
embassy said.
   Many other countries took similar steps to evacuate citizens, and
more than 2,000 foreigners jammed the international airport today
trying to leave.
   Official television late today blasted the United States for
providing refuge to astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, the nation's most
prominent dissident who recently said he feared he would be arrested
in a conservative crackdown.
   The 53-year-old Fang and his wife and child have been at the U.S.
Embassy since at least Monday, the State Department in Washington
said Tuesday.
   Sheltering Fang was ``interference in China's internal affairs,''
the television report said.
   Chinese witnesses reported more skirmishing between rival armies
on Beijing's outskirts.
   At least a dozen other Chinese cities were wracked by
demonstrations in protest of the weekend military massacre of
unarmed Beijing citizens, which has turned some armies against each
other.
   Six people manning a barricade on rails near the Shanghai station
died Tuesday when they were hit by a train unable to stop, a Chinese
source said. Angry crowds set the train ablaze.
   In Beijing, troops today shot and killed three people, a Chinese
witness said. ``I'm going home to Hunan. I'm afraid for my life in
Beijing,'' said a 25-year-old construction worker at the train
station.
   The political situation grew more confusin today, with an
official media report indicating the rising fortunes of Qiao Shi, a
shadowy figure considered the Communist Party's law-and-order chief.
   None of China's leaders have been seen since Premier Li Peng
appeared on television on May 25, five days after declaring martial
law in Beijing. Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping are believed
behind the crackdown.
   The Bush administration says the situation is so chaotic in the
world's most populous country that it can't tell who is in charge,
and that it appeared likely China's top leaders have left Beijing.
   Major convoys of troops roared up and down Beijing's main streets
throughout the day, with a group of nine armored vehicles including
tanks and nearly 50 trucks heading east just before 11 p.m.
   Thousands of soldiers traveling the same route from central
Tiananmen Square this morning chanted, ``We love the people, we love
the capital'' before opening fire.
   It was unclear whether the troops leaving the square were
evacuating from the city or going to take up positions in the
suburbs.
   They appeared to belong to the 27th Army, responsible for the
slaughter of perhaps thousands of people during an offensive that
began on Saturday to clear the city center of students seeking a
freer society.
   Several other armies reportedly are in the Beijing area. Chinese
witnesses said the 27th Army clashed early today with units of the
38th Army, the Beijing garrison, with automatic weapons about 12
miles east of downtown.
   The witnesses believed two onlookers died and said they were not
sure about military casualties.
   U.S. intelligence reports indicate the number killed in Beijing
has reached 3,000, while a Chinese government spokesman said Tuesday
that 300 died.
   Although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air,
dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for
diplomats and other foreign residents about 2{ miles east of
Tiananmen.
   ``My two children were watching television when the bullets came
flying through the window,'' Fred Krug, chief of security for the
U.S. Embassy, told the Chicago Tribune. ``The Chinese maid threw
herself across the children and covered them.''
   ``The bullets just whizzed around the living room. It was damned
hairy. It's a miracle no one was hit,'' the paper quoted Krug as
saying.
   Radio Beijing said the troops were responding to sniper fire that
killed one soldier and injured three others. ``The unit was forced
to fire back, and at one time, surrounded the diplomats' apartments
and nearby buildings,'' the radio said.
   U.S. Marines immediately began evacuating Americans from the
compound to the U.S. Embassy, and Krug said his wife and children
had gone to the embassy.
   A diplomatic source said not all residents could be removed
before Chinese troops sealed off the area to search for the alleged
sniper.
   A Soviet reporter locked outside urged soldiers to let him
evacuate his children. ``I've got five kids inside,'' he said. ``I'm
supposed to be taking care of them and they won't let me take them
out.''
   Some diplomats reported that soldiers entered buildings in the
compound. One U.S. diplomat said, ``They're going room by room, our
apartments are being trashed. Everything is being ruined.''
   But several dozen residents later told an Associated Press
reporter that troops did not enter the buildings and left after
about two hours. There were no reports of injuries.
   One Chinese man was dragged off by plainclothes security
officials who had searched the compound for the alleged sniper.
   Compound apartments command views of a strategic bridge where
troops took up defensive positions behind trees, curbs and trucks.
   The national television newscast today showed Chinese reporters
on a tour of garbage-strewn Tiananmen. Troops appeared sparsely
deployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperial
palace.
   ``Not one person died on the square,'' a martial law official
claimed. The newscast also showed several soldiers recovering from
wounds they said were inflicted by ``scoundrels'' during the weekend
fighting.
   An undetermined number of 27th Army troops and tanks remained in
Tiananmen.
   Diplomats estimated 200,000 soldiers from 13 army groups had
moved into the capital area, raising fears of a major battle for
control of the city of 10 million.
   The 27th Army is closely linked to President Yang Shangkun and
other Communist hardliners who ordered the suppression of the
pro-democracy movement. Other armies _ including the 38th _ are said
to be close to Zhao Ziyang, the moderate party chief reportedly
stripped of his post.
   Muddying the political situation was a Xinhua News Agency report
of the Supreme People's Court sending a telegram to Qiao, one of
five members of the party's policy-making Politburo Standing
Committee, n support of measures to suppress the pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The report was significant because the message was not sent to
Zhao, who was last seen in public on May 19.
   Diplomats often have named Qiao, 64, as a top contender to
replace Zhao, but little is known of him. Qiao is the former head of
the party Organization Department, which is in charge of security.

<HEAD>Governors Urge Long-Term Energy Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's governors urged Congress Wednesday
to try anew to forge a long-term national energy policy, and said it
should include tax and price incentives for the development of
domestic resources, even in currently restricted wilderness and
offshore areas.
   Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska, presenting
recommendations of the National Governors' Association after an
18-month study, declared ``the nation simply may not be able to
afford to permanently remove prospectively valuable (oil and gas)
areas off its shores, in vast areas of the West and in the Arctic.''
   ``As a personal note,'' he added, ``it is my belief that we
cannot afford to foreclose development in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge,'' even in the wake of the environmental furor over
the damage caused by the massive spill of the Exxon Valdez oil
tanker. ``Any development in currently restricted areas can and must
comply with the strictest environmental safeguards, including
standards for tanker safety,'' he said.
   Cowper noted the governors also recommended the export of Alaskan
oil on a barrel-for-barrel trade basis with other nations. He said
the current prohibition against such exports ``reflects the
political situation at the time the Alaska pipeline legislation was
passed, not the real workings of the oil markets or the economic
realities of oil trade.''
   ``I am convinced that such trades would be economically
beneficial, given the high transport cost of moving Alaskan oil to
Gulf Coast refineries, where much of it goes today,'' Cowper told
the House Banking subcommittee on economic stabilization. ``The
nation would not lose oil supplies as the result of these
transactions.''
   Cowper, who was joined by representatives of the governors of
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, New York and Montana, acknowledged that
``energy issues are not a central concern to most people today,''
despite memories of the oil shocks of the 1970s. ``However,'' he
said, ``I come before you ... to say that complacency is both
unwarranted and dangerous.''
   The trends are ``in the wrong direction,'' he said. ``Domestic
oil production is down, oil production in other stable and
`friendly' nations is down as a percentage of world oil production,
the concentration of oil productive capacity in the Persian Gulf is
up, and domestic oil consumption is up. In the transportation sector
alone, the nation now uses more oil than it produces.''
   Cowper noted the United States imported more than 43 percent of
the oil it consumed last year, and the bill accounted for more than
one-fourth of the U.S. trade deficit. ``What is more,'' he said,
``after nearly 15 years of improvement in our efficiency of energy
use, the most recent figures from the Department of Energy indicate
that our energy efficiency has started to decline. We use twice as
much energy per unit of GNP as Japan, and nearly twice that of our
European trading partners.''
   He said the governors want Congress to take a hard look at a
variety of incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration and for
coal, including standard investment tax credits on exploration and
the deregulation of natural gas wellhead prices.
   In 1977, Congress passed a law requiring the president to develop
and send to the Senate and House comprehensive 5- and 10-year energy
plans, and to update them every two years.
   Despite that law, said Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, head of the
subcommittee, ``this country has no national energy policy plan
worthy of the name.'' The last plan submitted by President Reagan,
in 1986, totaled a mere two pages, she pointed out.
   Ms. Oakar said ``the nation has been asleep on energy security
for the past eight years, and that is why the Alaska oil spill was a
wakeup call for America.''

   Six days into a bloody crackdown to suppress a
peaceful movement for freedom, the Chinese army has failed to pacify
Beijing.
   There are numerous reports of clashes between units of the army
that may be loyal to different political factions.
   The massacre Saturday and Sunday of hundreds of people blackened
the name of an army onced famed for its bravery and selflessness.
   Troops once affectionately called ``brother of the people'' and
``Uncle PLA-man'' quickly were termed ``running dogs'' and
``fascists'' by citizens enraged at the killings of relatives and
friends by their own army.
   The events in Beijing have raised some questions about the
discipline and readiness of the People's Liberation Army, the
world's largest army with an active force of more than 2 million
soldiers.
   Simple barricades of metal fencing stopped tanks and other heavy
equipment, breaking the drive trains of the vehicles, copies of
1950's Soviet models. Other trucks broke down in the road.
   The government announced Tuesday that 364 military vehicles,
mostly tanks and armored personnel carriers, were burned by unarmed
citizens.
   Tear gas used against the tens of thousands of people who came
out to stop the troops had little effect. One canister that landed
near an Associated Press reporter briefly made his eyes sting and
head spin. The effects soon wore off.
   Communications among military units also appeared poor.
   On Wednesday, troops on one Beijing bridge scurried behind trees,
concrete fences and trucks as if an attack were imminent. The
assault never came.
   On at least two occasions, armored personnel carriers, driven at
high-rates of speed, crushed foot soldiers.
   Reports of dissension among commanders is adding to the chaos.
   On Tuesday, armies supporting rival factions clashed in front of
the downtown Military Museum. On Wednesday, thousands of troops
moved onto an intersection then retreated, as if preparing for urban
warfare.
   Troops show a lack of discipline by firing randomly into crowds
of unarmed citizens.
   Shots in the air have killed people in high-rise apartment
buildings. The windows of one compound housing foreigners was
riddled by 27 bullet holes Wednesday. An armored personnel carrier
crushed at least seven students in a group of thousands that
retreated peacefully from Tiananmen Square.
   The army's violence has shocked Beijing residents.
   Until the weekend, the People's Liberation Army held an important
position in the hearts of many citizens in this capital.
   Formed in 1927, the army was famed not only for its fighting
prowess but for its rescue work during disasters and the critical
help it provided to peasants harvesting crops.
   ``The army goes with the people like fish swims through water,''
was a popular proverb.
   The PLA played a key role in the revolution. Heeding closely the
order of Marshal Zhu De ``not to steal a pin from the people,'' the
army gained the affection of China's peasantry as it battled the
corrupt Nationalists, or Koumintang, and invading Japanese.
   Communist China's founder, Mao Tse-tung, recognized this role in
his famous saying: ``Political power grows out of the barrel of a
gun.''
   But now the gun has been aimed on the common people.
   ``I lived through the Japanese occupation and the Kuomintang
corruption,'' said a 65-year-old man. ``Never have I seen anything
like this. The army comes from the people. How can it kill the
people?``
   Li Tieguo, a soldier until last year, said he had been proud to
be a veteran of the army, but that turned to horror when he saw
troops kick a 12-year-old girl in the chest and crush her heart.
   ``When I saw these hooligans kill that girl I was disgusted with
myself,'' he said. ``Can these people be my comrades ever again?``
   The army was one of the four pillars of China's modernization
program started by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping more than a decade
ago.
   So important is the military to Deng's planning that the only
title he has retained is chairman of the Central Military Commission.
   Under Deng's policies, the army has undergone a massive reform
designed to turn it into a professional fighting force. It has
decommissioned more than 1 million troops and purchased vast
quantities of materiel from the West.
   But problems remain.
   Clashes among units of the army in Beijing indicate the army has
failed to end the factionalism that has plagued the Chinese military
since the warlord period 80 years ago. Its seven regional armies are
clearly not all loyal to the same political commanders.
   The quality of its soldiers also remains suspect. Official media
reports quotes random surveys as saying about one-third of the
troops are illiterate and say deaf mutes and mental cases have been
accepted as conscripts.

   An Illinois man who hadn't seen his two
sons since they were toddlers was reunited with the boys today, 9{
years after their mother allegedly abducted them and fled along with
a religious group.
   Gerald Gromer, 34, of Bourbonnais, Ill., said afterward that the
reunion with sons Mark, 14, and Luke, 12, was ``not the happiest.''
   ``They can't understand why they have to go back to Illinois and
why I can't come to Vermont to join their church,'' Gromer said. He
described the religious group as a cult and said his children had
been ``somewhat brainwashed.''
   The reunion was held behind closed doors at a State Police
barracks. The boys did not comment.
   ``We have lots of things to work out in the next couple of
months. But we're going to make it,'' Gromer said.
   Loretta Gromer Frye picked up the boys for a Christmas party and
fled with them in 1979 after their father was awarded custody,
authorities said. She was arrested in Woodbury on Tuesday on
child-abduction and unlawful-flight charges.
   The religious group with which she fled settled in Vermont, said
State Police Sgt. Jean Lessard.
   Gromer learned Tuesday that his children had been found unharmed
near their Woodbury home, ending a search in which he said he spent
more than $20,000 and traveled to 11 states.
   ``We didn't know how to break the news to him, so when he came
into the office, we simply said `Merry Christmas, 1979,''' said Lt.
William Willis of the Illinois Division of Criminal Investigation.
``He got quite emotional. He broke down.''
   A lawyer appointed for Ms. Frye did not return a telephone call
today.
   Ms. Frye, 34, is a member of His Community, a religious group
founded by Roman Catholics in Kankakee in the 1970s, Willis said.
   His Community was started as a Bible study group but evolved into
a cult with strong leadership, said the Rev. James McDermott of St.
James the Apostle Church in Irwin, who worked with the group at its
early meetings.
   Willis said several women and children left the area when the
cult moved in 1979. ``They were going to be the new exodus from
Egypt,'' McDermott said.
   Ms. Frye used four aliases as the cult moved frequently around
the country, settling several months ago in Vermont, Willis said.
   ``In March we got a serious lead and have been in contact with
Vermont State Police and the FBI there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Appeal Argued In $9M Judgment Against Magazine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cryptic ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine
was obviously an offer to kill for money, a lawyer for relatives of
a murder victim said Wednesday in an appeal of a $9.5 million
judgment against the magazine.
   But attorneys for the magazine told a three-judge panel of the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Soldier of Fortune had no way
of knowing that a man's published offer to take on ``high risk
assignments'' would lead to the killing of Sandra Black in 1985. Her
husband and a gunman are in prison.
   The 5th Circuit judges gave no indication when they would rule on
the magazine's appeal of a jury's $9.5 million award to Mrs. Black's
son, Gary Wayne Black, 19, and mother, Marjorie Eimann, 65.
   John Roberson, representing the plaintiffs, said testimony in the
trial on their lawsuit made it clear that Soldier of Fortune
personal service ads had double meanings.
   ```High risk assignment' meant `gun for hire' in the lingo of the
magazine,'' argued Roberson, who cited testimony of an ad manager
for ``Soldier of Fortune.''
   E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., lawyer for the magazine, said high risk
assignment could mean gun for hire as a legal bodyguard or for law
enforcement.
   And he rejected Roberson's argument that the context of Soldier
of Fortune _ aimed at mercenaries, survivalsts and gun collectors _
should have led publishers to believe the ad would be used to
solicit murder.
   ``They (plaintiffs) concede that the same ad in Cosmopolitan or
Kansas City Weekly would have been all right,'' said Prettyman.
   Mrs. Black was shot to death Feb. 21, 1985, at her home about 90
miles northwest of Houston. Her husband, Robert, was convicted of
hiring hit man John Wayne Hearn to kill her after Hearn placed an ad
in ``Soldier of Fortune'' in late 1984. The price for the murder was
$10,000.
   Black is now on Texas' death row and Hearn is in a Florida prison
serving three life sentences for the Black killing and two other
murders in that state.
   The ad Hearn took out in the Boulder, Colo.-based magazine of the
Omega Group. Ltd offered the services of an ex-Marine and Vietnam
veteran with knowledge of weapons for ``high risk assignments in the
U.S. and overseas.''

   The State Department has ordered the evacuation
from China of all 258 U.S. diplomatic dependents and non-essential
government personnel and is urging all other Americans ``to leave at
once,'' it was announced today.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S.
Ambassador James Lilley had protested to Vice Foreign Minister Xhu
Qizhan about several instances of rifle fire that broke windows at
apartments occupied by U.S. government employees. She said there
were no injuries.
   ``The situation in Beijing, and in China, is volatile, uncertain
and increasingly dangerous,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Therefore, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and U.S.
Ambassador James Lilley ``are strongly urging all American citizens
to leave China,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. government had only urged U.S. citizens to
leave the capital city of Beijing.
   Ms. Tutwiler said no U.S. diplomats had been ordered to leave and
they were attempting to aid other U.S. citizens to get out of the
country.
   The spokesowman said the United States is chartering commercial
aircraft to fly to Beijing and Shanghai. Two wide-bodied aircraft
will arrive in Beijing on Thursday, and one will stop in Shanghai on
the way out, she said.
   The State Department's best estimate is that there are fewer than
1,000 Americans remaining in Beijing, she said. The U.S. embassy was
trying to arrange transportation from hotels and other locations to
the airport for U.S. citizens trying to leave.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``We have urged all other Americans in China to leave at once.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. government had no evidence that any
threats had been made directly against American citizens or other
foreigners, but given the increasingly chaotic situation, it was
``prudent and wise'' to order the evacuation.
   The embassy in Beijing had recommended the evacuation of
dependents and non-essential diplomatic personnel to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III early Wednesday, said Evans Gerakas, a
spokesman for the task force on China.
   Gerakas said the embassy reported that Chinese soldiers had
surrounded an apartment complex housing U.S. diplomats and prevented
them from leaving the area for some time.
   ``The Chinese troops outside the residence of the staff had
prevented them from getting out but that situation had been cleared
up and the people were let out and had gone back,'' said Gerakas.
   ``As far as I know our people had gone back into the compound to
pack and get their things.''
   ``I can confirm that they (the soldiers) have left,'' he added.
   Although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air,
dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for
diplomats and other foreign residents about 2{ miles east of
Tiananmen Square.
   The U.S. embassy's chief of security said bullets flew through
the window into a room where his two children were watching
television.
   A senior official in Washington said the bullets appeared to come
from ``the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to
clear Chinese civilians from the streets.''
   U.S. officials had said Tuesday they could no longer tell who is
in charge of China and they told Americans in Beijing to leave as
quickly as possible.
   ``There's been no communication from the leadership. There's no
indication who the leadership is,'' said Fitzwater.
   U.S. officials have mounted a wide-ranging effort _ using spy
satellites, embassy intelligence and interviews with Americans
leaving China _ in an attempt to determine what is going on in the
strife-torn nation. But so far the chaos enveloping China has defied
simple answers.
   ``You can't make judgments based on the situation at the
moment,'' President Bush said after a state dinner Tuesday night.
   John Sununu, his chief of staff, said the president must be
careful in his pronouncements about the struggle between
pro-democracy Chinese and hard-line government officials.
   ``You don't want to give them the excuse, if the president says
something strong, of saying, `See, it's being driven externally,'''
said Sununu, who also attended the state dinner.
   Fitzwater said Tuesday that China's senior leaders appeared to
have left the capital. He said the U.S. embassy has been in contact
with mid-level Chinese officials but has had ``no contact with the
top-level people _ and we've tried.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence reports indicate that the number of
dead in the weekend attack on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing
had reached 3,000, said a U.S. official.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that the
intelligence reports caution that ``hard evidence'' about the actual
number of dead is difficult to obtain in the confused situation, and
that the estimates could go higher.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker gave
the families of the 428 American diplomats and workers at the U.S.
embassy and the four consulates permission to depart, but the
facilities themselves would stay open.
   A State Department official said discussions were under way with
United Airlines and Northwest Airlines to supplement regular China
service so that one flight a day could carry out Americans.
   But United spokesman Joe Hopkins said in Chicago that his airline
had no plans to add flights.
   ``We're just operating our regular schedule'' of three flights a
week, he said.

her boyfriend.
   Making her first concert performance in eight years over the
weekend at Great Woods, an outdoor center about 40 miles south of
Boston, Cher told the audience she was alone again before launching
into her recent hit, ``We All Sleep Alone.''
   ``She said, `This next song has particular meaning for me because
I just broke up with my boyfriend,''' said Bill Costa, spokesman for
WXKS-FM, which put on the concert.
   The radio station's 10th anniversary show also featured Hall &amp;
Oates, Was (Not Was) and Grammy winner DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh

   Cher had left the concert stage for Hollywood, where she won the
1988 best actress Oscar for ``Moonstruck.''
   Her former boyfriend, Rob Camelletti, is an aspiring actor and
former bagel baker who got into highly publicized confrontations

   Rob Lowe's lawyers filed letters and affidavits
contending the parents of a teen-age girl the actor is accused of
enticing into a videotaped sex session tried to extort $500,000.
   The documents, filed Tuesday in Fulton County State Court, say
Lena Arlene Wilson and her attorney, J. Hue Henry of Athens, used
``extortionist tactics'' to force Lowe to ``pay a large sum of money
to avoid adverse publicity.'' The motion says she sought as much as
$500,000 in January.
   Ms. Wilson's lawsuit contends Lowe enticed her daughter, Lena Jan
Parsons, then 16, to have sex with another woman while Lowe
videotaped them in his Atlanta hotel room last summer.
   Authorities are investigating whether Lowe, 24, should be charged
with sexual exploitation of a minor, which carries a 20-year prison
sentence.
   Lowe's attorneys denied any wrongdoing and asked the court to
throw out the lawsuit and order Ms. Wilson and Henry to pay court
costs.
   Henry said Lowe's attorneys initiated the settlement negotiations
and that the extortion allegations were a desperate tactic. ``I
expected them to sling all kinds of mud because their client is the
one on film in compromising positions and there is no way they can
avoid that fact.''

   Singer B.B. King took his band to the
Mississippi State Penitentiary, where inmates say his special brand
of blues fit right in.
   ``Me being in the penitentiary, it's sad and depressing,'' said
inmate Douglas Jones, 24, who shook King's hand over a wire fence.
``And being in the penitentiary in the Delta, that's all we mostly
hear is the blues.''
   King performed such songs as ``The Thrill Is Gone,'' ``Nobody
Loves Me But My Momma'' and ``Sweet 16'' before about 1,500 inmates
Tuesday at Parchman's outdoor arena.
   ``This gives you a chance to see people out in the free world,''
said Mark Smith, 23, of West Point, who has served five years for
burglary.
   King performed Sunday in Flora with guitar-playing Republican
National Chairman Lee Atwater and gave a charity concert Monday
night in his hometown of Indianola.
   The 63-year-old blues king said the homecoming tour has been a
trip he will long remember.
   ``All through here I feel it's my roots,'' King said after the
prison concert. ``It's such a good feeling to be able to come home.''

   Reggie Jackson, who hit 563 home runs in
his 21 years in major league baseball, has struck out at selling
Chevrolets in his hometown.
   Jackson last week abruptly closed the dealership he bought last
year in hopes of profiting from his life-long love of automobiles.
   On Tuesday, a smiling caricature of Jackson and a sign promising
``World Championship Service'' still decorated the showroom full of
new cars, but the doors were locked.
   Jackson continues to operate a Nissan-Volkswagen dealership in
Palo Alto and a Ford outlet in the Sierra town of Quincy, but he
could not be reached for comment. Calls to his Berkeley dealership
and home in Oakland were met with operators' messages that both
numbers had been disconnected.
   Employees and other car dealers speculated that Jackson's lack of
success resulted from sparse demand for American-made cars in
Berkeley, where parking is limited and foreign cars are popular.

   Former astronaut Neil Armstrong will appear on a
French television special next month celebrating the 20th
anniversary of his historic walk on the moon, the producers
announced Wednesday.
   ``It's the only television program where Armstrong will appear in
person,'' Claude Atcher, president of Telemundi, which is putting on
the program, told a news conference.
   The program is to be taped on July 7 in Toulouse, the capital of
the French space industry, and broadcast on July 19, by Antenne 2, a
state-run network.
   Armstrong will be joined by fellow Americans John Glenn, Buzz
Aldrin, James Lovell, William Anders and David Scott, as well as
Alexis Leonov and Valery Koubassov of the Soviet Union and French
astronauts Patrick Baudry and Jean-Loup Chretien.
   The show will focus on the men who landed on the moon on July 20,
1969, and on the progress in telecommunications, meteorology and
medicine that resulted from space exploration.

   Cinematographer John Bailey has been
fired as director of ``The Long Walk Home,'' a civil rights-era
movie being filmed in Montgomery, and replaced by Richard Pearce.
   Film publicist Chappy Hardy on Tuesday cited creative differences
for the decision by New Vision Pictures to remove Bailey. Hardy said
he could not elaborate, but confirmed that Bailey was ``a few days
behind schedule'' on the relatively low-budget $6 million film.
   The movie, about a black woman and a white woman during the
Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, stars Sissy Spacek and Whoopi
Goldberg.
   Bailey, who had won acclaim as cinematographer for ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' ``The Big Chill'' and ``Ordinary People,'' was
making his directorial debut.
   Pearce has directed ``Country,'' ``Heartland'' and ``No Mercy.''
He also photographed four Academy Award-winning documentaries:
``Woodstock,'' ``Marjoe,'' ``Interviews With My Lai Veterans'' and
``Hearts and Minds.''

   Cortisone shots appear to speed the recovery of
premature babies with lung disease, helping them get off respirators
significantly more quickly than usual, a study concludes.
   Doctors gave the synthetic form of cortisone called dexamethasone
to tiny infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a form of lung
disease common in babies born with immature lungs.
   They said that the babies treated this way suffered no ill
effects from the medicine and seemed to avoid some of the
complications of months on mechanical breathing machines.
   The study, directed by Dr. James J. Cummings of the State
University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   However, an accompanying editorial by Dr. Mildred T. Stahlman of
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., cautioned that studies
done at single hospitals on small numbers of patients often fail to
hold up when repeated on larger numbers at groups of hospitals.
   ``An effective and safe treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia
is urgently needed,'' she wrote, ``but more definitive data from a
multicenter trial will be required before the use of dexamethasone
can be widely recommended.''
   In the study, doctors gave 42 days of dexamethasone to 13 babies
who weighed less than 2.7 pounds. For comparison, they gave 18 days
of the drug to 12 babies and placebos to 11 others.
   Those who got the full course of dexamethasone were weaned off
the respirators after a median of 29 days, compared with 73 days for
those who got less medicine and 84 days for the babies in the
placebo group.
   The babies getting full dexamethasone also were more likely to
have normal neurological development.

<HEAD>Former Gestapo Prisoner Raising a Penny for Each of 6 Million Slain
Jews</HEAD>

   A Polish immigrant who escaped the World War II
Holocaust is directing a one-man effort to collect a penny of
remembrance for each of the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis.
   ``During the war,'' said Adam Starkopf, ``a Jewish life wasn't
worth a penny.''
   In the past two years, he has gathered $24,000 toward his goal of
$60,000 in pennies, which will be donated to the proposed U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.
   While Starkopf, 75, and his wife and daughter survived, he said
it's important to remember the millions who did not.
   ``Not only to perpetuate the memory, but to alert the present and
future generations who think this can never happen again,'' he said
Wednesday.
   As vice president of the museum's Illinois chapter, Starkopf also
is helping direct a $10 million fund-raising effort in the Chicago
area.
   But pennies make it easy to donate, even for children, he said.
   ``From mouth to mouth, we let our friends know about the
project,'' Starkopf said.
   ``One woman called me to say she had 50 pounds of pennies. ...
When I go down to the store with my wife and they give me change,
maybe 50 cents, I say, `Will you be so kind to give me the change in
pennies?'''
   The donations, still in pennies, are delivered from time to time
to the museum committee in Washington.
   Starkopf and Pela, his wife of 53 years, were born and educated
in Warsaw, Poland.
   His father and in-laws were killed at the Treblinka concentration
camp, and he said about 150 members of his extended family lost
their lives in the Holocaust.
   For a while, Starkopf said, he and his wife escaped capture.
   ``I looked very Aryan _ blond-haired, blue-eyed,'' he said.
   But in February 1942, his luck ran out and he spent five months
in prison before he escaped.
   Later, he smuggled his 18-month-old daughter out of Warsaw by
drugging her with the help of a physician and placing her in a tiny
casket.
   His wife accompanied the casket to a Jewish cemetery outside
Warsaw, while Starkopf left the city by another route.
   The family reunited at a prearranged spot and with forged
identity papers were able to live as non-Jewish Poles outside Warsaw.
   ``It's the only case in the Holocaust when a child was saved as a
dead child,'' said Starkopf.
   When they came to this country in 1948, Starkopf said he had $3
in his pocket. Eight years ago, he retired from the sporting
goods-import company he started.
   The daughter, Joanna Brainin, 47, is married with two children
and lives in suburban Highland Park.

   Foreign embassies were arranging special flights
Wednesday to evacuate the families of diplomats and other nationals
from China, which the French foreign minister said was ``on the
verge of civil war.''
   The U.S. Embassy ordered dependents of its diplomats to leave the
country. The embassies of Austria, Britain, Canada, the Philippines,
Switzerland and West Germany were arranging to get diplomatic and
civilian evacuees out by Friday.
   French, Italian and Soviet diplomats said they had no plans to
evacuate citizens, but the French and Italians said many had left
voluntarily.
   Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said in Paris the
French Embassy staff would be reduced ``to the indispensable
minimum'' because ``this grand and vast country is on the verge of
civil war.''
   An embassy spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said no
evacuation was planned because ``we don't think it is wise to create
a panic by rushing people out when we don't feel there is an acute
danger.''
   He said several wives and children of embassy staff members have
left voluntarily.
   Chinese troops ordered into central Beijing on Saturday to quell
a pro-democracy movement killed or wounded thousands of civilians.
Indiscriminate firing by soldiers continued Wednesday.
   ``Due to the unstable situation in China, the security situation
is deteriorating,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Andy Koss said in
announcing the evacuation order.
   About 125 of 185 embassy dependents in Beijing would leave on a
special commercial flight to Tokyo and the others already had gone,
he said.
   Koss said 73 dependents from four U.S. consulates in China would
leave as soon as possible but all diplomatic personnel would remain.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
fewer than 1,000 Americans remained in Beijing.
   A British official said privately the embassy arranged at least
four flights to Hong Kong for embassy staff members, families of
nationals and others.
   ``We decided it was prudent to reduce our staff,'' he said, but
added that most of the passengers were Chinese from Hong Kong, the
British colony scheduled to be returned to China in 1997.
   About 60 British citizens left Wednesday and 61, most of them
students, departed Tuesday, he said.
   Roland Hauser of the Austrian Embassy said: ``We gave the
recommendation to leave the country because there is no guarantee of
safety. I was not even allowed out of my diplomatic residence
compound today.''
   Chinese soldiers sealed off a foreign diplomatic and residential
area for two hours Wednesday in what they said was a search for a
sniper.
   Dozens of embassy cars drove out when the compound reopened,
their occupants clutching cardboard boxes, suitcases and food
supplies.
   Hauser said the 40 Austrian students, teachers and businessmen in
Beijing were urged to leave, and those who chose to do so would join
Swiss evacuees Thursday on a flight to Geneva.
   Non-essential Canadian diplomatic personnel and all dependents
were to take a Canadian Airlines flight to Tokyo on Thursday, said
Sgt. Michel Riberdy, assistant military attache.
   ``There is a situation in Beijing which seems to be worsening and
we have been thinking that we might not be able to get people out
later,'' Riberdy said.
   He said only about 15 of the embassy's 45 staff members would
remain.
   Japanese Embassy staff members telephoned nationals in Beijing
urging them to leave by commercial flights or on Japanese airliners
scheduled to arrive Thursday.
   A West German diplomat said his embassy was trying to arrange a
special special flight to evacuate Germans on Friday.
   Corazon Tatarata, vice consul of the Philippines, said Filipinos
would be flown out thursday.
   Eugenio Campo of the Italian Embassy said it was urging Italians
to leave but would not send any diplomats home. He estimated 30
percent of about 220 Italians in China had left or were planning to
do so.
   A duty officer at the Soviet Embassy said there were no plans for
personnel to leave. The Soviet complement of 77 registered diplomats
is second only to the Americans, with 120.

<HEAD>At Least 12 Percent of Children Have Mental Disorders: Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 14 million American children suffer
from some mental disorder, a problem that is costing society
billions of dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens,
according to a study released Wednesday.
   ``There is a stigma associated with mental illness and there is a
major problem in how children's problems are perceived,'' said James
F. Leckman of Yale University, the chairman of an Institute of
Medicine committee that prepared the study.
   Mentally ill children have historically been ``underserved,'' he
said, noting that ``this is a clear and persistent problem in our
society.''
   Although the committee said millions of youngsters are not
receiving the mental therapy they need, Leckman said the study was
``an optimistic report'' because the last two decades have witnessed
breakthroughs in understanding, preventing and correcting many
childhood mental diseases.
   The committee recommended that the National Institute of Mental
Health be given annual budget increases to develop research and to
train professionals to deal with the specific mental illnesses of
those under 18.
   ``We must examine our priorities as a nation ... to ensure that
these real and persistent problems no longer place in jeopardy our
most valuable resource _ future generations of productive
citizens,'' Leckman said.
   The report said that a conservative estimate says 12 percent of
America's children are mentally disturbed, but that the true number
could be as high as 22 percent, or about 14 million.
   Leckman added, ``The likelihood is that the rate is increasing.''
   Of the mentally ill, members of the committee said, only 20
percent to 33 percent receive care. Some studies, the experts said,
say the majority of mentally ill children are never even diagnosed
by parents, teachers and doctors.
   ``For the physically handicapped, the evidence is that 80 percent
of those are served,'' said Dr. Fredric Solomon, director of the
mental health division of the Institute of Medicine. ``Yet for
serious emotional disturbance, the evidence is that less than 30 and
maybe less than 20 percent are served, even when they are noticed.''
   Solomon said studies have shown that even medical professionals,
such as pediatricians, generally recognize only about about
one-fourth of their patients who are suffering from mental
disorders. He said often the children who receive attention are
those with disruptive behavior.
   Dr. Glen R. Elliott, vice chairman of the committee and a
professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San
Francisco, said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood
suicides and in eating disorders.
   The report identified a variety of problems besetting America's
children. These include developmental impairments that slow
education and learning; emotional disturbances that include anxiety,
depression or both, and behavioral problems that include disruptive
and antisocial acts.
   Some of those problems manifest themselves as chronic drug use,
sexual problems and eating disorders.
   Poverty and associated ``harsh child-raising methods'' contribute
heavily to the number of troubled youth, the experts said. The
report noted that youngsters with mental and behavioral problems
``may exceed 20 percent in some populations, such as inner-city
children, who are exposed to severe psychological adversity.''
   The total cost to the nation has not been measured, but Leckman
said it is ``enormous.''
   ``Billions of dollars are spent each year in direct service
delivery,'' said Leckman. ``Added to this is the tremendous
emotional burden carried by their families.
   ``Childhood depression, left untreated, may lead to suicide,'' he
said. Some disorders, such as autism, may be a lifelong disability;
other mental problems may lead to drug abuse and criminal behavior.
   ``Despite the distress and misery and great costs to society,
relatively few resources have been directed at efforts to advance
our knowledge,'' said Leckman.
   The committee said that the nation needs to invest in fundamental
research to learn how to treat such children and to train
specialists who can conduct research and treatment.
   ``There are fewer than 100 child psychiatrists who devote 30
percent of their time to research,'' Leckman said. ``The figures are
equally dismal in psychology, pediatrics, social work and special
education.''
   The committee recommended a nationwide plan directed by the
National Institute of Mental Health to nurture careers in childhood
mental health and to sponsor research into methods of preventing,
detecting and treating mental illness in children. The report called
for a national investment that would grow to $198 million annually
by the fifth year.
   The Institute of Medicine is part of the National Academy of
Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress as an adviser
to the federal government in scientific and technical matters.

   Protest of the massacre of unarmed citizens in
Beijing has spread to other Chinese cities and triggered clashes in
Shanghai, according to reports reaching the capital Wednesday.
   Six people manning a barricade on a rail line near the Shanghai
station were killed by an out-of-control rain that ran over them
Tuesday night, a Chinese source reported.
   Members of the crowd set a railroad car on fire after the
accident and beat up 21 railway security officers, Shanghai radio
said Wednesday.
   ``While trying to put out the fire, firefighters were surrounded
and attacked, and the hose was ripped in many places, seriously
impeding the work of extinguishing the fire,'' it said.
   Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in downtown Xian,
capital of Shaanxi province, against the hardline leaders who
ordered troops into Beijing to quell a pro-democracy movement, a
Western witness said.
   City gates remained barricaded in the ancient capital and rumors
spread of an imminent invasion by soldiers, the witness said on
condition of anonymity.
   Xian authorities said people went to factories and urged workers
to strike. Local radio said city life had been ``seriously wrecked''
by the protests.
   In Shanghai, China's largest city, small funeral marches in honor
of those killed in Beijing were held Wednesday, a diplomatic source
said.
   Many posters went up urging a general protest strike but most
people did not appear to heed the call, the source added.
   A radio report from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, spoke
of a continuing rampage by ``a handful of thugs.'' It said they
``smash cars, loot shops, rob pedestrians and throw petrol bombs at
bookshops.''
   It also said ``a number of scoundrels'' stormed city offices
Sunday, roughing up 300 security officials.
   About 11 people were arrested and one who resisted was shot and
wounded, the radio reported. It did not mention unconfirmed reports
of 20 people killed in the rioting.
   Many cities reported that barricades had crippled traffic and
threatened local economies. In Xian, all 48 public public
transportation routes were halted and Mayor Shang Zhenling of
Changchun, in Jilin province, said: ``If this situation continues,
the city's economy will be paralyzed.''
   Roadblocks in Harbin, a northeastern city, disrupted transport
and the supply of daily necessities, causing price increases, the
Heilongjiang Daily reported Wednesday.
   City officials in Lanzhou, in northwestern Gansu province, issued
a similar appeal, said: ``Patients and medicines cannot be delivered
to hospitals in time, babies and the aged have no milk to drink.
Heaps of refuse cannot be removed.''
   Shanghai radio said 40,000 people were mobilized to remove
roadblocks, but protesters ``smashed four vehicles ferrying the
roadblock removers.'' It did not mention casualties.
   A statement from Xian authorities said: ``Unless we resolutely
expose and put a stop to the plots of a very small number of people,
major damage will be done to production, work, and social order in
the city, staff and workers will suffer difficulties in daily life,
and the consequences will be unimaginable.''

   I woke to gunfire Wednesday morning.
   I almost rolled over and went back to sleep. The sound of guns
has become routine since hundreds of thousands of soldiers rolled
into downtown Beijing last weekend and drove student protesters from
Tiananmen Square.
   Instead, I dashed to a window that overlooks Changan Avenue,
Beijing's main east-west street, where dozens of tanks and trucks of
troops were parked two blocks west of my apartment.
   Peering over the sill, I could see no violence: only a few dozen
Chinese bicycling under a grim, gray sky, skirting torn up road
dividers.
   But the import of the shots became clear later. Chinese
authorities claimed someone had fired on the troops marching along
Changan Avenue from a foreigner's apartment in the compound next to
mine.
   Dozens of soldiers took up positions outside the compound,
pointing their rifles at the buildings. Some fired at the buildings,
reportedly knocking out windows. Dozens more closed the compound
gates while plainclothes officials searched inside.
   Eerily, a loudspeaker on an army vehicle began playing gentle
music.
   ``Do they want to fight or do they want to dance?'' asked a
Chinese employee watching from a stairwell in the compound.
   The simple act of closing the compound gates touched off panic in
the foreign community. Those locked inside gathered to plead with
the impassive soldiers to be let out.
   ``I have a plane ticket and they won't let me out to catch the
plane,'' said a European diplomat. A Soviet reporter pleaded in vain
for permission to evacuate five children.
   A long line of cars from various embassies formed outside.
   After two hours, plainclothes officials collared a Chinese man
who they said fired at the troops, and brought him out to the
soldiers. Abruptly, they formed lines and trotted off.
   The gates opened, and hundreds of residents rushed to cars and
vans, some bound for the airport and some for hotels further from
the troop positions.
   All but a small group of residents also left the compound where
The Associated Press has its office and several staff apartments.
   ``Yes, we are brave,'' boasted a Bulgarian diplomat who stayed
behind. A Bulgarian woman living two floors down from him opened her
door only after much persuasion and perspired with anxiety.
   ``Be careful, it's not safe out there anywhere,'' she urged.
   More shops were open Wednesday than earlier in the crackdown, but
business was slow. Far fewer vendors appeared with fruits and
vegetables.
   I loaded as much as I could into my knapsack and bicycle basket.
Eggplant and stringbeans were available Tuesday, but only cabbages
and tomatoes were in the shops on Wednesday. Prices were heavily
inflated, cutting into my dwindling cash supply. Banks are closed.
   The government warned that water and electricty might be cut if
order is not restored, and I went home and filled jars and buckets
with water.
   Gas stations closed early in the turmoil. The driver of one of
the few taxis still operating said he was charging a minumum of $50
for the airport trip, usually a $9 fare. He talked one desperate
passenger into paying $1,000, he said.
   The International Hotel sent guests a cheery letter Wednesday
inviting them to a cocktail party with the management and hoping
their stay would be ``memorable.'' But a second letter warned,
``Stay off the balconies and keep your heavy curtains closed.''
   Away from the foreign neighborhood, the mood of panic eased. Most
Chinese were too nervous to travel to work, but they relaxed within
their walled stone homes in the narrow alleyways.
   Old men played Chinese chess on a canal bank, oblivious to
rifle-toting soldiers who roamed a nearby alley in groups of two and
three.
   One man called out to me: ``Have you been shot at yet?''
   Two colleagues were. AP reporter Terrill Jones said non-uniformed
security forces marching in formation down Changan Avenue shot at
him twice as he stood outside the International Hotel taking
photographs. He fled to the hotel entrance, only to find the door
boarded from the inside.
   AP reporter Dan Biers was on Changan further east when an army
truck approached from the north with soldiers firing out the rear.
He took shelter behind a tree.

<HEAD>Jurors Question Witnesses in Dakota County Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an experiment that defies centuries of
courtroom tradition, Dakota County District Court jurors have been
allowed to pose written questions of witnesses in a criminal trial.
   ``It made me feel a part of what was going on,'' juror M. Kathryn
Lease said. ``It was wonderful. If I had to do it over again, I
would have asked more questions.''
   Judge Gerald Kalina and lawyers on both sides also said they were
pleased with the experiment in the case of a man accused of stealing
from his employer, even though the jurors were unable to reach a
verdict and the trial ended with a hung jury. Prosecutors have not
decided whether to retry the case.
   The experiment was part of a study being done by social
psychologist Larry Heuer of Northwestern University in Evanston,
Ill., and Steven Penrod, a psychologist and lawyer teaching at the
University of Minnesota Law School.
   They said about 100 judges nationwide have agreed so far to
participate.
   Penrod, who has done extensive research on juries, was attracted
to the issue of jury participation in the early 1980s when a judge
in Madison, Wis., decided to allow jurors to ask questions.
   Penrod and Heuer, then at the University of Wisconsin, did
research that included 29 judges and 67 trials across Wisconsin.
   They found none of the disadvantages that some lawyers and judges
had predicted _ that the process would drag out trials or that
jurors would become involved to the point of taking sides. Instead,
they found some evidence that jurors were more attentive and more
confident of their verdicts.
   In the Dakota County trial, M. Christine Misurek, an assistant
Dakota County attorney, and defense attorney Michael McDonald agreed
to the experiment.
   As each witness finished testifying in response to questions from
the lawyers, Kalina asked the jurors if they had questions. If they
did, they passed their written questions to the judge. He and the
lawyers discussed whether the questions were appropriate. If they
were, the judge read them to the witness.
   The defendant, Allen Haram of Apple Valley, was charged with
conspiring with his brother, George Potter, to steal from Haram's
employer, Brook's Superette in Lakeville.
   According to testimony, Potter walked into the store Feb. 27
wearing a mask. The clerk, Haram, gave him money from the safe. Two
store supervisors apprehended Potter as he was leaving. Potter
allegedly told the supervisors that he and Haram had staged the
robbery, and both men were charged.
   The jurors asked six questions. Kalina decided two were
inappropriate but allowed the other four. Two of those involved the
store's alarm button, since there was some confusion over whether
Haram pushed it. The jurors asked about its position and whether it
is tested periodically.
   McDonald said not all defense attorneys would want the procedure
used in every trial. In some cases, he said, the more information
that comes into a trial, the likelier it is the defendant will be
convicted.
   ``You want the jury to go into the jury room with a lot of
questions because you want them to feel less comfortable in finding
him guilty. You want them to think the state had not met its burden
in proving him guilty,'' he said.

   The City Council has voted to sever
ties with the local Elks Lodge, a major contributor to its youth
programs, following the group's recent rejection of two black
applicants.
   The council voted 6-0 Tuesday to support Mayor Sheila Lodge's
call to block donations from the 1,800-member lodge to
city-sponsored youth programs. The lodge donated $24,000 last year
for disabled children.
   ``Let the Elks know that if the financial contributions are
tainted with racism, the city doesn't accept it,'' said Isaac
Garrett, president of the local chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Elks leaders said the lodge does not condone racism, blaming the
rejections of the black applicants last month on a small minority of
members. It only takes three votes from the entire membership to
turn down an applicant.
   Woody Wodarczak, the local group's exalted ruler, noted that the
Santa Barbara lodge has joined other central coast lodges in urging
the national Elks organization to change voting rules to admit more
minority members.

   As luck would have it, the student who won
a car at a post-prom party was the one who couldn't take it home.
   Stephan Metzger is an exchange student from St. Gallen,
Switzerland. He won the 1981 Dodge Aries at an all-night, post-prom
party sponsored by Wilson High School's chapter of Students Against
Driving Drunk.
   The party last month featured music by a disc jockey, volleyball,
baketball and swimming. A car dealership in Wilson donated the car
as an incentive for students to attend the party, an alternative to
drinking and driving after the prom.
   ``It was very early in the morning and I was very tired, but I of
course was very happy. I never won a car before,'' said Metzger, 18.
   He said he would have to sell the car because he doesn't have a
driver's license, his stay in the United States is almost over and
it would be too expensive to ship home and convert to use with
European gasoline.
   Also, Metzger, who speaks his native Swiss-German dialect as well
as fluent English, German, French and some Italian, said he won't
really need a car when he goes back to finish high school in St.
Gallen, a city of 76,000 in northeast Switzerland.
   ``You could get around with public transportation and a little
bit of walking,'' he said.

   Neither sleet nor rain, snow nor heat nor
dead of night will stop the U.S. Mail. But dive-bombing sparrows?
Now that's a different story.
   The Postal Service has discontinued deliveries to the Morse
family home because the carrier considers birds nesting above it a
hazard.
   Mark J. Morse said the nest is in the rafters of the porch, about
four feet above the mail box. And the carrier reportedly told his
superiors the bird ``dive bombs'' him when he attempts to deliver
the mail.
   ``I really can't understand the reasoning,'' Morse said. ``The
nest was built by a sparrow and most people don't consider sparrows
to be dangerous birds.''
   Morse said he and other family members have called postal
officials, but were told if carriers feel there is a hazardous
situation they must deal with, they do not have to deliver the mail
to a home.
   Postmaster Jake Zaleski said he was informed of the problem
Tuesday and will take steps to rectify the situation.
   ``I will contact the family,'' Zaleski said, ``and see if we
can't work out an alternate delivery plan. I have to consider the
safety of the carrier and if he thinks there is a hazard I have to
respect his thoughts.''

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan,
described as a leader of many firsts, addressed her own uniqueness
in a speech to Congress Wednesday.
   During her first official visit to Washington, the 35-year-old
Ms. Bhutto has been called the youngest prime minister in the world
and the only woman leader of a Moslem country in modern times.
   ``As a representative of the young, let me be viewed as one of a
new generation of leaders, unshackled by the constraint and
irrational hatreds of the past,'' said the U.S.- and
British-educated prime minister.
   ``As a representative of women, let my message be, `Yes, you
can,'' she continued, drawing applause.
   ``And as a believer of Islam, in this august chamber, let my
message be about a compassionate and tolerant religion, teaching
hard work and family values under a merciful God,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   ``That is the Islam I know and that is the Islam we must all come
to understand,'' she said, seeking to project moderation as opposed
to the image of militance applied by some Americans to Moslem groups
accused of terrorism and of holding U.S. hostages.

   An investment banker who was beaten and
raped in New York's Central Park in April was admitted to Gaylord
Hospital on Wednesday to begin an intensive rehabilitation program,
the hospital said.
   The 28-year-old woman, whose name has not been released, was
brought to Gaylord by ambulance from Metropolitan Hospital in New
York City, where she had been a patient since the April 19 attack.
   ``She was admitted to the 16-bed unit for traumatic brain injured
patient and will undergo a period of evaluation during which a
complete treatment plan will be developed,'' said Lori Ann Brass,
the hospital's spokeswoman.
   The average length of a stay for traumatic brain injury patients
is 60 days, but Brass said that varies, depending on the patient.
   ``The purpose of rehabilitation is to restore function. We help
people to get back to as productive a life as possible,'' Brass said.

   An offshore intake pipe sucked up a
scuba diver and pulled him 1,650 feet through the duct, depositing
him at a nuclear power plant.
   ``I thought I was dead,'' said William Lamm, 45, who was
spearfishing when he was pulled into the 16-foot diameter,
barnacle-studded pipe off Florida Power &amp; Light's St. Lucie nuclear
plant on the Atlantic Coast.
   ``It was darker than any dark I've ever seen, and I tried to hold
my arms in front of me for balance, but I tumbled and bounced all
over the sides of the pipe.''
   Lamm's trip through the plant cooling-water system ended four
minutes later in a canal at the power station, where a security
guard saw him surface, FPL said. The scuba diver was shaken up and
scraped but not seriously hurt.
   Lamm said the suction pulled off his mask and diving gloves and
ripped his mouthpiece out several times as he moved through the pipe
at 7 feet per second.
   The pipeline has no grating but a 70-by-70-foot cap suspended a
few feet above the opening to reduce suction and prevent the capture
of foreign objects such as fish and turtles, utility spokesman Gary
Mehalik said Wednesday.
   ``You'd have to get up underneath the velocity cap and then
approach it over the intake'' to get caught, he said.
   The intake is marked by a buoy and is listed as a hazard on
navigation charts, Mehalik said.
   But Lamm said he saw no danger signs.
   ``There was a buoy nearby, but that marked the shallow water,''
he said. ``I got into about eight feet of water and got sucked down,
then in.''
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will investigate, said
spokesman Steve Horwitz in Atlanta.
   Lamm, a scuba diver for five years, said it will be a long time
before he dives again, if at all.

<HEAD>Opponents Say Long Fight Over Hazardous Waste Plant Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents have finally won the fight to
block construction of the world's largest hazardous waste treatment
plant after a decade of protests and legal battles.
   ``We're planning a party, a big party,'' said Steve Irving, the
Baton Rouge lawyer who handled the opposition.
   The final blow for the $135 million plant, planned by the IT
Corp. of Torrance, Calif., came quietly when a court-ordered
deadline for appeals passed Tuesday.
   ``IT did not intend to appeal,'' company attorney Maureen
Harbourt said. ``That's it.''
   The plant would have been built beside the Mississippi River near
Burnside and next to the antebellum Houmas House, frequently used as
a set for movies.
   The lack of an appeal apparently means IT is writing off $19
million already spent on the project, including the purchase of
1,100 acres, the development of engineering plans and other costs.
   Paul H. Templet, secretary of the state Deparatment of
Environmental Quality, revoked the company's hazardous waste permit
on May 8. Under law, IT had 30 days to appeal.
   Templet said he rescinded the permit because the company did not
prove the plant would not contaminate groundwater and create other
environmental problems.
   The permit, issued to the hazardous waste management firm eight
years ago, had been challenged in a lawsuit filed by Save Our
Selves, a coalition of environmental and citizens groups who said
the plant would create more problems than it solved.
   ``When we started out, this was a state program,'' said Irving.
``State officials were involved. All the wheels were greased.''
   ``Part of the game plan was to ram it down our throats,'' he
said, ``make it an `existing facility.'''
   The opponents successfully stalled the permit process long enough
to keep the plant from establishing a legal standing.
   Then they won a ruling that IT violated the state ethics code by
preparing its own feasibility study of the site for the state.
   ``We knew that if we deprived them of making a quick killing, it
would die of its own weight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday called on
world leaders to seize this ``moment of extraordinary awakening''
and push ahead with efforts to promote freedom and human rights.
   Later, he warned Roman Catholics in affluent Denmark against the
dangers of ``slavery to self under the guise of freedom'' and the
indiscriminate pursuit of material goods.
   John Paul, on the seventh day of a Scandinavian tour, addressed
diplomats in Copenhagen and then flew to Oem, a tourist center on
the Jutland Peninsula. There, he celebrated Mass for 10,000 people
on the ruins of a medieval monastary.
   Speaking of what he said were worldwide winds of change, the pope
told diplomats:
   ``Mine is an invitation to you, to all men and women with
responsibility for the public life of nations, to do everything
possible to encourage this moral awakening,'' the pope said.
   He called on his audience ``to further the peaceful processes
which seek to implement freedom, respect for human dignity and human
rights throughout the world.''
   The pope said despite this century's wars and political tensions,
as well as the afflictions of international drug trafficking and
AIDS, there was reason for hope.
   ``The world is living through a moment of extraordinary
awakening. The old problems remain, and new ones arise,'' the pope
said. ``But there is also a growing awareness of an opportunity
being offered to give birth to a new and better era.''
   John Paul didn't mention specific countries, but he has
previously expressed his approval of political reforms in his native
Poland and elsewhere. A Maronite Christian woman holding up a
Lebanese flag and a group of Polish folk dancers were among those at
Oem. About 20 Asian children pressed around the pope for blessings
as he arrived.
   Immigrants, mostly from Poland and from Catholic countries in
South America, have flocked to John Paul's appearances throughout
Scandinavia, an overwhelmingly Lutheran region. Danish Catholics
number only 28,000.
   The pope also met priests, nuns and representatives of Denmark's
Catholic community. To them he spoke of the sexual and family mores
in this liberal society.
   He said church teaching called for ``lifelong fidelity in
marriage, responsible parenthood ... reverence for every human
person from the moment of conception until natural death, the equal
and complementary dignity of women and men.''
   John Paul, who has also visited Norway, Iceland and Finland on
his Scandinavian tour, travels to Sweden on Thursday. He returns to
Rome Saturday.

<HEAD>Increases Reported in Anti-Gay Harassment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violence against gay people continued to be
``alarmingly widespread'' last year, said a report released
Wednesday by the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force.
   A total of 7,248 incidents, ranging from harassment to homicide,
were reported to the group in 1988 by 120 organizations in 38 states
and the District of Columbia.
   About two-thirds of the incidents were verbal harassment,
according to the report. The remainder were: physical assaults, 12
percent; threats of violence or menacing, 10 percent; vandalism, 6
percent; police abuse, 3 percent; bomb threats, 1 percent; and
homicide, arson and ``other,'' 1 percent. The ``other'' category
includes police negligence, attempted violence and one kidnapping.
   ``As in past years, anti-gay violence and victimization proved to
be alarmingly widespread in 1988,'' author Kevin Berrill said at a
news conference called Wednesday to release the annual study, the
group's fourth.
   ``This report does not claim to measure the full extent of
anti-gay violence and victimiazation that occurred last year,'' he
added. ``Without question, the vast majority of anti-gay episodes in
1988 were not counted.''
   Claudia Brenner of Ithaca, N.Y., victim of one of the more
vicious anti-gay episodes last year, spoke at the news conference
``because it's too easy in our world of murder and death statistics
to forget that there are actually people'' behind the numbers.
   ``The fact that crimes are targeted against particular groups _
in this case, lesbians _ requires a societal response,'' Brenner
said, calling for passage of the Hate Crime Statistics bill, which
is pending in both houses of Congress.
   Brenner, a 31-year-old architect, was camping in Pennsylvania
with her lover, Rebecca Wight, last May when a man who had been
stalking them in the woods opened fire. Wight was killed but Brenner
survived, despite being shot at least five times. Their assailant,
Stephen Roy Carr, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced
to life in prison without parole.
   The report noted a disturbing rise in the number of hate groups _
mostly neo-Nazi skinheads _ attacking gay people.
   ``Although most of the perpetrators of anti-gay violence are not
affiliated with organized hate groups, hate groups pose an
unprecedented and growing threat to the lesbian and gay community,''
Berrill said. ``Nineteen organizations representing 17 communities
across the U.S. reported anti-gay activity by hate groups last year,
most of it perpetrated by neo-Nazi skinheads.''
   The report also provides evidence that homosexuals are being
increasingly victimized on college campuses.
   Nineteen percent of the anti-gay incidents reported last year
took place on college campuses, the report found. Seventeen percent
were classified as AIDS-related, ``indicating that hatred and blame
associated with the epidemic continue unabated.''
   There were 240 more incidents documented in 1988 than in 1987,
the report said. It attributed the increase to a special request for
information from the Metropolitan Community Churches, which have a
special ministry to the gay and lesbian community, and to campus gay
and lesbian organizations.

   Angry residents on Wednesday honked horns,
planted Chinese nationalist flags and demanded that Chinese leaders
resign during spontaneous protests of the military crackdown in
Beijing.
   The protests broke out even though organizers cancelled planned
demonstrations for fear of more violence after rioters stormed
Chinese banks earlier in the day. Police said five officers were
injured and 15 protesters arrested.
   From dawn until nearly midnight, a stream of protesters converged
Wednesday on China's official Xinhua News Agency, the mainland
government's de facto embassy in this British colony. They shouted
abuses at the Chinese leadership and placed flowers for slain
demonstrators.
   Police said they had no estimate of the number of protesters, who
walked six abreast and stretched down several streets.
   Most wore black or white clothes, traditional Chinese funeral
attire, and many carried banners denouncing Chinese leaders and
praising the pro-democracy demonstrators ousted by soldiers from a
central square in Beijing nine days ago. Hundreds of people died in
the Beijing crackdown.
   Outside the Xinhua office Wednesday, at an altar across the
street, protesters placed flowers for those victims.
   A middle-aged man helped plant several flags of the rival Chinese
nationalist government on Taiwan and lamented: ``I had hopes for the
Communists with their 10 years of open-door policies. But now I am
disappointed.''
   Meanwhile, a convoy of taxis, cars and trucks, estimated at
between 2,000 and 3,000 by police, cruised past the building,
honking their horns. Many had black flags tied to their radio
antennas.
   Some groups had called for a general strike on Wednesday, and
many shops in this bustling British territory were closed. Many
displayed anti-Communist posters on their shutters.
   Sir David Wilson, the colony's governor, left Wednesday night for
London to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of
Parliament to discuss the future of the territory, where anxieties
about future Chinese rule have increased since the Beijing violence.
   Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997, when a
territorial lease expires. Some British lawmakers are now demanding
that the accord be reconsidered.
   Organized protests were called off Wednesday after police fired
tear gas to disperse about 7,000 rioters who hurled rocks and
bottles at police in Kowloon, Hong Kong's twin city within the
colony.
   Police said the clashes developed after a crowd drove through the
area honking their car horns to protest the Chinese military moves
and then attacked several mainland Chinese banks.
   About 98 percent of Hong Kong's population of 5.7 million are
Chinese, and two-thirds of them are refugees from mainland China or
their descendants.
   People who fled to this coastal colony from the mainland,
meanwhile, reacted to reports of the violence with grief and shock.
Official Chinese reports have blamed the violence on rioters and
talked mainly of attacks on soldiers.
   ``One of my colleagues received a fax describing the massacre in
Beijing and started crying. But the manager came in, tore the paper,
and said it was all rumor,'' said a Hong Kong resident who had just
returned from Zhanjian in southern Guangdong province.
   Australian tourist John Flitcroft, who was at Tiananmen Square in
Beijing when the troops swept out student protesters, said he hid in
a dormitory facing the square that night.
   ``They (tanks) crushed the whole square,'' he said. ``They just
ran across like a lawnmower, crushing the tents with students in.''

<HEAD>Navy Will End Cruise-Missile Engine Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1978 agreement requiring the Navy to buy
cruise-missile engines from a defense contractor in Michigan is
illegal and will be canceled, the Navy has told a senator in a
letter made public Wednesday.
   According to the letter, dated April 11, from then-Navy
Undersecretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
the open-ended, multimillion-dollar agreement with Williams
International of Walled Lake, Mich., was negotiated by William
Parkin.
   Parkin, a consultant and a former Navy employee, and the former
Navy engineer he bribed were given 26-month prison terms June 2 for
illegally scheming to help two companies get Pentagon contracts.
   Parkin and Stuart Berlin were each fined $25,000 and ordered to
serve two years of supervised probation after their release from
prison. Parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Berlin to
provide secret Navy bid information that would help Teledyne
Industries Inc. and Hazeltine Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., obtain
lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon.
   The Garrett letter to Levin was made public by the Project on
Military Procurement, a Washington-based whistle-blower group.
Danielle Brian-Bland, a spokeswoman for the group, declined to say
how the letter was obtained.
   The Associated Press sought comment from the Navy on the
agreement. The Navy's press office said it was unable to provide
information immediately. Both the Navy and Levin's office confirmed
the existence of the Garrett letter.
   The agreement guarantees Williams a certain level of engine sales
to the Navy. Without the agreement, Williams would be required to
compete for contracts with Teledyne Industries Inc., the other
supplier of the engines. Williams is fighting the Navy's decision.
   Williams and the Navy negotiated the agreement in order to
provide the Defense Department with a second source for cruise
missiles, said Linda Gustitus, staff director of the Senate
subcommittee on oversight of government operations, which Levin
heads.
   Williams licensed some of its technology to Teledyne and, in
return, the Defense Department agreed to buy at least 240 engines a
year from Williams, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up
to 1,200 engines annually.
   The agreement ``contains no ending date and purports to apply not
just to the contract with which its negotiation was associated but
to `all government contracts for F107 engines, its derivatives and
associated logistic items having cruise-missile applications,'''
wrote Garrett, who is now secretary of the Navy.
   The Navy, under the agreement, must contract through Williams in
buying engines from Teledyne. Williams has been paid about $36,000
for each of the 708 engines built by Teledyne, Garrett wrote.
   Such provisions violate a 1984 amendment to defense purchasing
legislation designed to ensure competition in Pentagon procurement
because it binds the government to reward future contracts, Garrett
wrote. Levin was an author of the amendment.
   In a May 12 letter, made public by Levin, a Navy contracting
officer, Frances L. Bradley, told Williams the agreement wasn't
authorized by purchasing laws in effect when the deal was negotiated.
   The F107 engine is used in sea-based Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   ``The government ought to keep its word,'' Levin said Wednesday.
``The government made a contract, and under the Constitution, you
cannot abrogate a contract.''
   The 1984 law applies only to new agreements, not to existing
ones, and so the agreement with Williams is within the law, Levin
said. ``I don't concede in any way the 1984 law was violated by the
contract even if it came after the 1984 law,'' Levin said.
   Williams' vice president for public relations, David Jolivette,
declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel, saying the
matter had not yet been resolved.

   The new U.S. ambassador to Britain
laid a wreath Wednesday at a memorial to the 270 people who died in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, and he faced angry protest from a
victim's wife.
   Wendy Giebler of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. said U.S. officials have
been ``rude and cruel'' to relatives of Flight 103 victims. She also
accused investigators of witholding information.
   ``We want to know why it was possible to get the bomb aboard and
why Pan Am did not react to warnings,'' said Mrs. Giebler, wife of
Flight 103 passenger William Giebler, who died in the Dec. 21
bombing.
   After the ceremony at Dryfesdale cemetary, Mrs. Giebler, 26,
called for an independent investigation to supplement the work of
Scottish police, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.
   She spoke only briefly to U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto, who
visited Northern Ireland and Lockerbie this week after taking up his
post in London last month.
   At a news conference later, Catto said he would be surprised if
anyone had been rude to relatives, and he expressed satisfaction
with the progress made by the investigation based in Lockerbie.
   ``Initiatives have been taken to increase airport security, to
cooperate in law enforcement and bring the scourge of terrorism to
an end,'' Catto said.
   Mrs. Giebler, a member of the Victims of Flight 103 group, said
she came across the ceremony by chance.
   ``Not only is the U.S. government not doing enough to bring the
terrorists to justice, it is not keeping the relatives informed of
what went on,'' she said. ``I do not believe anything has been done
by the government to protect people flying today,'' Mrs. Giebler
said.
   The chief investigator, John Orr of the Strathclyde Police, has
said the plane was brought down by a bomb planted in a
radio-cassette player and detonated by an altitude-sensitive trigger.
   The device probably was put aboard the flight in Frankfurt, West
Germany, and transferred to the Boeing 747 during a stop at London's
Heathrow airport, Orr has said.

   There are more jobs waiting for the Class of
1989 from the nation's major agricultural colleges than there are
graduates to fill those jobs, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   J. Patrick Jordan, administrator of the department's Cooperative
States Research Service, said a recent informal survey showed
another decrease in the number of agricultural school graduates. At
the same time, more companies are recruiting on campuses.
   The telephone survey was done by Purdue University, West
Lafayette, Ind. Although the number of graduates is down, the survey
found an increase in the number of freshmen enrolled in agricultural
courses.
   Allan D. Goecker, assistant dean of agriculture at Purdue, said
that the job market has been more competitive and that both
employers and students are making earlier commitments.
   Half of the 1,721 undergraduates in Purdue's school of
agriculture are enrolled in three departments _ agricultural
economics, horticulture, and forestry and natural resources. The
school expects to graduate 365 seniors this year, up from 355 in
1988, Goecker said.
   Starting salaries for Purdue graduates range from $18,000 to
$30,000 a year, with the average just over $20,000, he said.
   Goecker is a member of a USDA committee that has forecast an
annual shortage of 4,000 food and agricultural science graduates
into the 1990s.
   Other schools surveyed included Texas Tech, Lubbock; Colorado
State University, Fort Collins; Mississippi State University,
Mississippi State; University of Florida, Gainesville; California
State University, Fresno; and Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.

   Flood waters slowly receded Wednesday
in central and southern Sri Lanka after five days of storms and
mudslides that killed at least 315 people, officials said.
   Rescue workers carrying food and medicine Wednesday reached
stranded inland hill areas that were worst hit by the rains, which
began Saturday night, according to D.J. Wijesundera, of Colombo's
Social Service Department.
   More than 200,000 people were left homeless, including 60,000 who
were forced to flee Colombo's northern suburbs, Wijesundera said.
   The Kelaniya River, which winds north of the capital to the sea,
surged over its banks Tuesday, but dropped again by about an inch
Wednesday, according to Upali Delpechitra, of the Irrigation
Department.
   ``The waters are expected to recede very slowly,'' he said. Walls
of sand bags were put up along the river banks to protect villages
near Colombo, he said.
   Most of the deaths occurred in the hills and valleys of the
Kegalle district, about 45 miles northeast of Colombo. Entire
villages of thatched huts were buried after a torrential downpour on
Saturday triggered landslides of mud and rocks already loosed by a
month-long monsoon.
   Meanwhile, in Teldeniya, 60 miles northeast of Colombo, police
opened fire on students protesting the presence of Indian soldiers
on the Indian Ocean island. At least one person was killed and six
others were injured, when students tried to storm a police station,
police said.
   There are 40,000 Indian soldiers in Sri Lanka under a 1987 Peace
accord to end a 6-year-old Tamil separatist movement. President
Ranasinghe Premadasa last week asked India to withdraw its troops by
the end of July but New Delhi has refused.
   India became involved in the ethnic conflict of its southern
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to
the rebel cause.
   Tamils are 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils
say they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population.

   Military officials Wednesday
called off a search for seven missing gold prospectors believed
trapped in makeshift mine tunnels during a landslide that killed at
least 13 people.
   There were no more signs of life inside the shafts that collapsed
on May 30 and continuous rains made further digging risky, according
to Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, the regional Philippine police chief.
   Baccay said five people had been rescued from the collapsed
tunnels on the slopes of Mount Diwalwal, a gold-mining community in
Davao del Norte province.
   Heavy rains caused a maze of tunnels on the mountain to collapse
and triggered a fire that razed at least 160 shanties of miners and
traders.
   Baccay said 13 bodies were recovered. He said 750 miners were in
the tunnels at the time of the accident but most made their way to
the surface through two large tunnels that did not collapse.

   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China left for
Cuba Wednesday after an overnight stay protested by Mexicans angered
over soldiers' slaughter of student protesters in Beijing, news
reports said.
   About 40 demonstrators shouted at Qian when he arrived Tuesday
night at Benito Juarez International Airport, the Excelsior news
service.
   The news agency said he had been in Ecuador as part of an
official Latin America tour when troops killed hundreds of
pro-democracy demonstrators in China early Sunday.
   Excelsior said the minister, greeted by China's ambassador to
Mexico, was quickly surrounded by security officers who then whisked
him away in an embassy vehicle without taking questions from
reporters. His car was followed by eight Chinese embassy security
vehicles.
   He left at shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday (8 a.m. EDT) for Cuba
on a commercial flight. Excelsior said the foreign minister was
scheduled to fly later in the day from Cuba to Houston.
   The Notimex news agency said Qian was to make a brief stopover in
Los Angeles later Wednesday en route to China.

   More than 9,000 soldiers have been unable to halt
the bloody ethnic violence in Uzbekistan, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev reported Wednesday.
   He told the Soviet congress arson and killing continued in the
Central Asian republic. Soviet media reports said the death toll had
reached 67 and authorities had lost control.
   Accounts in state-run media on the strife in the in the Fergana
Valley 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow said some people were stoned
to death and others ``perished under the burning debris of houses.''
   ``One thing is clear: the local authorities have lost control of
the situation, failed to cope with it on their own,'' the official
news agency Tass reported from Uzbekistan.
   Vremya, the evening television news program, said houses were set
afire Tuesday night in the city of Fergana and authorities had
received word that a ``cruel crowd of hooligans'' made an ethnic
attack in Kokand, 40 miles to the northwest.
   To protect them from marauding Uzbeks, several thousand members
of the Meskhi Turk ethnic minority were moved to a temporary camp
outside Fergana ``in the steppe under the scorching sun,'' Tass said.
   Helicopters and armored personnel carriers are patrolling
Fergana, a city of more than 200,000 people, Tass said, and the
Communist Party daily Pravda said 9,000 Interior Ministry troops
were in the eastern Uzbekistan valley trying to maintain order.
   Violence in the grape- and cotton-growing region began May 23-24
after a dispute in a bazaar, when a Meskhi Turk spoke rudely to a
fruit vendor because he thought her prices were too high and knocked
over her plate of strawberries, Uzbekistan Communist Party chief
Rafik Nishanov said.
   That incident triggered a marketplace brawl, and in later
paryoxyms of ethnic violence that reached a crescendo last weekend,
more than 400 houses, 116 cars, eight industrial enterprises and
some schools and government offices were torched or wrecked, Tass
said.
   ``Youths aged from 16 to 20, drunk or on drugs, performed
barbarous, reckless actions,'' Tass said. It said 56 people had been
killed, including many women and children, but the Communist youth
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said the death toll had climbed to 67.
   Most of those who lost their homes were Meskhi Turks, the
newspaper said. The entire population of 300,000 Meskhi were
uprooted from their homeland in Soviet Georgia by dictator Josef
Stalin in 1944 and shipped to the Soviet East for forced
resettlement.
   In Moscow, a somber Gorbachev told the Congress of People's
Deputies that authorities had the situation in the Fergana Valley
under control, but that there were still incidents of arson and
killings.
   ``It has not changed for the better,'' Gorbachev said. ``It
concerns us very much.''
   The Congress joined him in appealing to Uzbeks and Meshki Turks,
both of whom are traditionally Moslem, to halt the bloodshed. It was
the second such appeal issued this week.
   The Turkish minority, which adopted Islam centuries ago, has been
pressing its demands to be allowed to return to its ancestral
homeland in Georgia since the national parliament began meeting in
Moscow late last month.
   Authorities charged with keeping order in the Fergana Valley
openly admitted the situation was still volatile and ethnic hatreds
keen.
   Despite the heavy military and police presence, Tass reported
that as recently as Tuesday night gunshots were heard in several
neighborhoods in Fergana.
   The violence was the latest ethnic dispute to erupt in the
southern Soviet Union, where disputes in the Caucasus region and in
Central Asia have killed scores of people and left thousands
homeless.
   A national outcry followed the use of chemicals, shovels and
clubs by soldiers who broke up a pro-independence rally in Georgia
on April 9. Nineteen civilians were killed in the assault, and one
was later shot by soldiers for violating curfew.
   In his remarks to the Congress, Gorbachev seemed to demand a firm
but measured response in dealing with the Fergana violence.
   ``The developments in Uzbekistan show once again that we should
be patient, reserved and alert and should bear responsibility for
our actions in everything, especially in what concerns inter-ethnic
relations,'' the Soviet leader said.

   A striking Eastern Airlines baggage
handler who says he was struggling to make ends meet tried to sell
$250,000 in counterfeit money to an undercover agent, authorities
said.
   Joe Shaheen, 58, was arrested on conspiracy charges Monday along
with his brother and two other men. They were released Tuesday and
Wednesday on $50,000 bail.
   Shaheen and his brother John Peter Shaheen, 60, agreed to sell
the fake money to an undercover agent for $40,000, the Secret
Service said. The Secret Service said it is still investigating the
source of the money.
   In interviews before his arrest, Shaheen said he had fallen
behind on car payments, sent his wife to Boston to live with their
son and took in a boarder since the Machinists strike began March 4.
He collected $100 a week from the union strike fund but said he went
through his savings. He briefly held part-time jobs.
   ``Once they see Eastern Airlines on the application, they don't
want to hire. I applied for unemployment compensation, but was
rejected because of the union dispute,'' he told a federal
magistrate on Tuesday.
   Also charged were Pedro Fiallo, 26, who identified himself as a
professional gambler, and Frank Consalvo, 28, a partner in a
party-planning store.
   Wally Haber, a Machinists spokesman, said Wednesday that a
program had been set up for members with serious financial problems
caused by the 3-month-old strike.
   ``We've got food banks and we've got health and welfare money to
help needy cases,'' Haber said, noting members were advised for two
years to try and save money because of prospects for a strike or
sale of the airline.
   ``Most of our people, and I would say better than 90 percent, had
put some money away for a rainy day,'' he said.

<HEAD>State Department Orders Diplomatic Dependents Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, calling the situation in
China ``volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous,'' ordered
the evacuation on Wednesday of its 258 diplomatic dependents and
urged all other private Americans to leave as soon as possible.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and U.S. Ambassador James
Lilley ``are strongly urging all American citizens to leave China,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.
   ``The situation is deteriorating,'' she said.
   The evacuation order and the new warning to private citizens
reflect a heightened concern by the U.S. government about the
situation in Beijing, as well as in the provinces outside the
capital. The United States has no legal authority to force private
Americans to leave the country.
   On Tuesday, the department had urged private U.S. citizens only
to leave Beijing, the center of the turmoil sparked by weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   The evacuation was ordered after Chinese troops raked a
diplomatic compound with gunfire and another incident in which
Chinese soldiers surrounded an apartment complex housing U.S.
diplomats and prevented them from leaving the area for some time.
   No Americans were injured, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``The situation in Beijing, and in China, is volatile, uncertain
and increasingly dangerous,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She refused to describe the situation in the country as ``civil
war.''
   But the spokeswoman, who said a day earlier that she couldn't
verify that fighting among the military had occurred, confirmed that
some clashes between small army units had taken place.
   The United States has chartered commercial aircraft to fly to
Beijing and Shanghai to supplement regular U.S. airline departures.
Also, officials have organized transportation to help U.S. citizens
get to the airports, the spokeswoman said.
   She said that the road to the Beijing airport remained open and
that Chinese officials are allowing the extra charter flights to
land.
   Two aircraft, one from United Airlines and another from
Continental Airlines, will leave Beijing Thursday, and there is a
possibility of a third, she said.
   A regularly scheduled flight is slated to leave Friday. Other
planes will be chartered if necessary, she added.
   Their purpose is ``to facilitate the departure of all those who
want to leave and all those who have been ordered to leave,'' she
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said she did not know the exact destination of the
flights.
   Although the shooting at the diplomatic compound appeared to be
warning shots fired into the air, dozens of bullets struck windows
facing the street in the housing area for diplomats and other
foreign residents about 2{ miles east of Tiananmen Square.
   The U.S. Embassy's chief of security said bullets had pierced a
window into a room where his two children were watching television.
   An administration official, who spoke on condition he not be
named, said U.S. officials believe that 84-year-old Deng Xioaping,
who has been reported in ill health ``is still alive ... and still
running the show.''
   The official noted that while the U.S. government can't order
private citizens to leave the country, ``a real change'' of
atmosphere has taken place in recent days, and that ``more and more
people'' have decided to leave the country.
   The official said that there are ``a fair number of children''
among the 258 dependents and non-essential personnel who have been
ordered to leave and that officials are making sure every child is
accompanied by either a parent or a friend on the flights out of the
country.
   Ms. Tutwiler said ambassador Lilley had met with Vice Foreign
Minister Xhu Qizhan ``and registered a strong protest'' about an
incident of rifle fire that broke windows in apartments occupied by
U.S. government employees.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. government had no evidence that any
threats had been made directly against Americans or other foreigners
but, given the increasingly chaotic situation, it was ``prudent and
wise'' to order the evacuation.
   The Chinese government, meanwhile, notified the department that
it had decided to postpone next week's visit of Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen.
   ``Our government agreed it was wise to postpone (the visit) at
this time,'' the spokeswoman said. She said the Chinese gave no
explanation for the change of plans.
   Ms. Tutwiler emphasized that no U.S. diplomats had been ordered
to leave, adding that their presence was necessary to aid the
departure of other U.S. citizens.
   The spokeswoman said the State Department's ``best estimate'' is
that there are about 1,000 Americans still in Beijing.
   Although some 8,800 Americans had notified U.S. officials in
January that there were somewhere in China, ``we do not have any
accurate number of how many Americans are in China'' at the present
time, she said.
   She added that the number of Americans appears to have
``dramatically been reduced'' over the last several days as U.S.
businesses have asked their workers to leave.
   Besides leaving on the U.S.-flag carriers, Americans have also
departed on other national carriers, Ms. Tutwiler noted. She said
that if there are extra seats on the U.S. planes, citizens from
other nations will be allowed to use them.

<HEAD>Newspaper: SWAPO Opponents Colluding To Capture Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians, security officials and the
man who will supervise elections met last fall to coordinate
strategies to defeat the SWAPO guerrilla movement at the polls this
November, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, South African President P.W. Botha said his
country would not hesitate to launch raids against an independent
Namibia if guerrilla attacks were staged from the territory South
Africa has ruled for 74 years.
   The Namibian newspaper, which supports the South West African
People's Organization guerrillas, said the secret meeting of the
now-defunct National Security Council raises questions whether
``free and fair'' elections can be held in November as scheduled
under a U.N. independence plan for the territory.
   The Sept. 7 talks included Cabinet members of Namibia's interim
government, the heads of the territorial army and the police, as
well as Andries Visser, Namibia's chief electoral officer, according
to The Namibian, which obtained the minutes of the meeting.
   ``It must now be worked out how to mobilize people and discredit
SWAPO while boosting the internal (political) parties,'' Andrew
Matjila, a Cabinet member who belongs to Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, told the meeting.
   Dirk Mudge, leader of the multiracial Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, told a news conference Wednesday evening that no orders
were issued for civil servants to help defeat SWAPO.
   The recently disbanded interim government included a Cabinet made
up of Namibians from several political parties chosen at elections
that SWAPO boycotted because they were based on race.
   South Africa is in charge of implementing the independence plan,
which took effect April 1. More than 4,000 U.N. personnel are in
Namibia to monitor the process, but their role is mostly supervisory.
   SWAPO is favored to win the November elections but it is not
clear if it will be able to capture the two-thirds majority needed
to control the formation of a new government.
   The guerrilla movement has fought a 23-year bush war against
South African rule.
   SWAPO officials were not immediately available for comment.
However, they have repeatedly accused South African officials, the
security forces, and even U.N. officials of being biased against the
guerrilla movement.
   The U.N. special representative to Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, has
raised the matter with Pienaar, according to a U.N. statement.
   The statement stressed the need for ``strict impartiality'' in
the elections. U.N. spokesmen declined to elaborate.
   As part of the independence process, Botha on Tuesday approved
the repeal of security laws that banned the African National
Congress and other anti-apartheid guerrilla organizations in the
territory.
   On Wednesday, answering criticism from the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party in South Africa that the action would make it
possible for the ANC to operate from Namibia, Botha issued his
warning.
   Botha said in a letter to the Conservative Party that Pienaar had
the ability to prohibit South African members of the ANC or other
organizations from coming into the territory. Pienaar remains in
charge of the territory until a new government is installed,
expected some time next year.
   After the territory becomes independent, Botha said, the South
African government will not hesitate to send the South African
Police and Defense Force into Namibia if it appeared that the ANC or
other organizations were launching operations against South Africa
from the territory.

<HEAD>Psinakis Cleared Of Shipping Explosives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader in the U.S.-based opposition to
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and a hero to the
current government was acquitted Wednesday of illegally shipping
explosives for use against Marcos.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated a day and a half before
finding Steven Psinakis, 57, innocent of conspiring and taking part
in the shipment of detonating cord from St. Louis to San Francisco.
   He could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   ``Truth and justice prevails,'' Psinakis declared as he shook
hands with his lawyer, James Brosnahan.
   Psinakis told reporters that the central point of the case was
``whether some misguided elements in the Reagan and Bush
administrations had conspired to destroy freedom and democracy in
the Philippines ... to maintain a ruthless and corrupt
dictatorship.''
   Psinakis, a Greek-born U.S. citizen and husband of a prominent
Philippine woman, was a leader for more than a decade in the
Movement for a Free Philippines, a U.S.-based group made up largely
of Philippine exiles opposed to Marcos, who left the Philippines
during a popular revolt in February 1986.
   Other leaders included Sen. Benigno Aquino, who was later
assassinated and whose wife, Corazon, now is president of the
Philippines, and Raul Manglapus, currently foreign affairs secretary
under Mrs. Aquino.
   Manglapus was a defense witness for Psinakis. Mrs. Aquino
intervened in getting Psinakis freed on $250,000 bail after his
arrest in 1987. Others in her government denounced the charges and
warned that a conviction could harm U.S.-Philippine relations.
   Prosecutors denied political motivation throughout and said they
had evidence that Psinakis was the mastermind of a plot to transport
explosives to be used in a campaign of bombings against the Marcos
government in 1981.
   Evidence included two wiretapped telephone calls from St. Louis
physician Arturo Taca to Psinakis, in which the two men discussed a
need to get ``40'' and ``60,'' which the prosecution said were
references to weights of detonating cord.
   A letter was found in Psinakis' home that referred to ``stripping
the rope,'' allegedly meaning a removal of explosive powder from the
detonating cord. Six hundred feet of stripped detonating cord was
found in Psinakis' garbage, and powder identified by the FBI as
explosives was recovered from tools in his San Francisco house.
   The defense seized on gaps in the FBI investigation, including a
period of more than five hours that the garbage sat unattended after
its seizure, to suggest that incriminating evidence had been planted
by Marcos agents who were following Psinakis.
   Psinakis was indicted in December 1986, just before the
expiration of the five-year legal deadline, and 10 months after the
fall of Marcos.
   Psinakis attributed the prosecution to an alleged promise to
Marcos by Ronald Reagan, just after his election as president in
1980, to target the Philippine dictator's U.S. foes for
investigation. Defense attempts to dismiss the case before trial on
the grounds of selective prosecution were rejected by U.S. District
Judge Robert Schnacke.
   Marcos' illness has prevented him from traveling from his exile
home in Hawaii to New York to face racketeering charges alleging he
plundered his homeland of more than $100 million and used the money
to buy real estate and art in the United States.
   Marcos was described as resting comfortably Wednesday after
emergency surgery for an abdominal infection, but his prognosis for
recovery remains poor, a hospital spokesman said.

   An Israeli helicopter gunship attacked
pro-Iranian guerrillas in south Lebanon after they launched a rocket
into Israel's border ``security zone'' Wednesday, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the gunship fired ``three rockets at
Hezbollah positions'' southeast of Jbaa at midday and at least three
guerrillas were wounded.
   He said the attack near the mountain town occurred after
Hezbollah militiamen fired the rocket into Marjayoun in the Israeli
zone, which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles just north of the
border.
   The rocket ``exploded in a residential area of Marjayoun at 10:10
a.m.'' but no casualty reort was available, the spokesman said.
   About the air attack, the spokesman said: ``Dust and smoke
billowed from the stricken positions'' on a wooded slope on the
western flank of the Israeli zone. ``Hezbollahis fired anti-aircraft
guns at the gunship, but it was not hit.''
   It was the sixth Israeli air raid in Lebanon this year. On May
31, Israeli jets raided Palestinian and Hezbollah bases in south and
east Lebanon, killing two people and wounding 12.

<HEAD>House Members Call for Greater Federal Role</HEAD>

   Members of a House panel on aging said
Wednesday the federal government should do more to help states
combat the growing problem of abuse and neglect of the elderly.
   How much abuse there is cannot be documented, but only a fraction
of the cases are reported to state authorities, the panel was told.
   ``Members want to see the national government play a more active
role,'' Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., told Michio Suzuki, acting deputy
commissioner of the Administration on Aging in the Department of
Health and Human Services, at a House subcommittee hearing.
   Downey, chairman of the human services subcommittee of the House
Select Committee on Aging, acknowledged that the federal effort has
been hamstrung by lack of public awareness of the problem and cuts
in available funds. funding cutbacks. But, he said, ``We're prepared
to give you more resources.''
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., questioned how Suzuki's agency
could address the problem without a clear picture of its national
scope, and added: ``I'm not sure a federal passive role is going to
help.''
   Suzuki rejected the description of his agency as ``passive.'' He
said the office plays ``an active role in a supporting role'' by
providing assistance to states.
   ``The Administration on Aging has long recognized that prevention
of elder abuse is primarily a state responsibility and a state
prerogative,'' he told the panel.
   But Downey and other members noted that the federal government
has made many efforts to take the lead in fighting child abuse,
including monitoring state activities.
   ``It seems to me that what would be of national interest in the
younger years of life would be of national concern in the older
years of life,'' he said.
   Suzuki said the federal agency has not evaluated individual state
efforts to prevent abuse and neglect of older Americans, but is
``trying to be responsive'' to states' needs in developing programs,
supplying educational materials and enhancing public awareness.
   Though states are not required to spend any of the money they get
from the agency on protective services, 40 states do allocate some
of their federal funds to these services, he said.
   ``States are as interested in this as we are,'' he said.
   Suzuki said his agency relies on the National Aging Resource
Center on Elder Abuse to gather information on the scope of the
problem and the efforts of the states. The center, operated by the
American Public Welfare Association, the National Association of
State Units on Aging and the University of Delaware, receives
federal funds.
   Toshio Tatara, director of the center, testified that because the
reporting systems in many states are incomplete, it is impossible to
estimate accurately the extent of the problem.
   He said state surveys turned up 140,000 reports of abuse of the
elderly last year, but he said that represents only a fraction of
the incidents.
   One study found that only one of 14 cases gets reported, which
would mean that last year there would have been nearly 2 million
``reportable'' cases, he said.
   ``Elder abuse is far less likely to be reported than child abuse,
about which the public has gained greater awareness of the problem
than it has about elder abuse,'' he said.
   Tatara called for better coordination of federal programs and
regulations.
   As an example, he cited a federal Medicare and Medicaid policy
that he said contributes to patient ``neglect.'' Under that policy,
the cost of a medical device that prevents bed sores is not covered,
though the cost of treating bed sores is, he said.

   Two Cuban-born Republicans launched bids Wednesday
to become the first from Miami's exile community in Congress, but
the Democratic Party's leader said the battle for the late Claude
Pepper's seat could start turning the GOP tide.
   State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, an educator elected in 1982 as
the first Hispanic woman in the Florida Legislature, and
conservative businessman Carlos Perez, once hailed by President
Reagan as an example of the American dream, announced in bilingual
news conferences they would run in the Aug. 1 Republican primary.
   National Democratic Chairman Ron Brown told reporters in
Washington the 18th District contest will be tough, but he said the
national party would contribute as much help as possible to the
Democratic nominee.
   Winning the Aug. 29 special election will signal a turning of GOP
momentum and help spark Democrats in the South, Brown said, calling
the region the ``backbone of the Democratic Party's tradition.''
   ``The perception that we are flat on our backs in the region is
false,'' said Brown.
   The Miami Herald reported Wednesday that state Sen. Jack Gordon
of Miami Beach, the most prominent name in a long list of potential
Democratic candidates, said he will seek the Democratic nomination.
Gordon, who had said earlier he would make a decision by Friday,
didn't immediately return telephone calls Wednesday.
   Gordon, 67, has been a spokesman for liberal causes during 16
years in the state Senate, and his participation in a rally against
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels angered many Cuban and
Nicaraguan exiles. He is married to Washington Post writer Myra
MacPherson.
   Meanwhile, Jeff Allen, a Miami sports attorney and agent, said
Wednesday that he will be the only black candidate in the race. A
registered Republican, Allen said he was considering running as an
independent.
   Ros-Lehtinen, married to U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, said she
would continue the district's tradition of ``a leadership which has
been based on a caring conscience and conservative convictions.''
   Pepper, who died May 30 after holding the seat 26 years from its
inception, was known as the last of the New Deal liberals.
   Asked if she would continue Pepper's programs, she said: ``I am
not Senator Pepper. I am Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. We have many common
values and many common philosophies. We have some differences.''
   She identified her priorities as bridging ethnic and social
differences, protecting Social Security, the war on drugs and crime,
a tough stand on Cuba and Nicaragua, and strong support for Israel.
   Perez called his announcement a show of his pride in his adopted
country.
   ``I feel very proud about the United States. I feel very proud of
being an American,'' Perez said.
   In his 1984 state-of-the-union address, Reagan told Perez's story
of coming to this country as a destitute immigrant and building a
multimillion-dollar banana importing business. Perez raised funds
for Reagan and formed a fund-raising committee for former National
Security adviser Oliver North.
   Pepper, with nationwide prestige, won every election for the
district since his first in 1962, with his closest race in the past
decade a 61-39 percent victory in 1984 over Cuban-American Ricardo
Nunez. He drew no opposition last year at age 88.
   The district's registration is 54 percent Democrat, down from 72
percent a decade ago. The district is a multi-ethnic mix that ranges
from inner-city black areas to retirement enclaves to Little Havana
to upscale suburbs. Estimates of the number of Hispanics in the
district range from 40 percent to nearly half.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney left Washington
Wednesday for his second NATO meeting in three months.
   Cheney, whose first exposure to NATO since becoming defense
secretary March 17 came last month, when he attended a Nuclear
Planning Group session, flew to Brussels, Belgium, for Thursday's
start of a regular Defense Planning Committee meeting.
   He and his counterparts are to discuss the next steps in
furthering the conventional arms control proposal proferred by
President Bush at last week's NATO summit meeting.
   Cheney originally had planned to spend several days after the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting visiting U.S. ships and
troops in Europe on a get-acquainted tour. He canceled those plans,
however, after deciding there were still too many matters requiring
his attention in Washington.
   The defense chief will return to Washington on Friday.

   Foreigners fleeing Beijing were returning to their
homes Wednesday with terrifying stories of the killings they saw and
the chaos they left behind.
   They flew to Tokyo, Hong Kong and other cities after several
countries ordered their citizens to leave the Chinese capital, where
soldiers have killed or wounded thousands of people in crushing a
pro-democracy movement.
   ``I saw a soldier's body, burned, hanging from the bridge. That
made me get the hell out of there,'' Australian tourist Jimie Reid
said in Hong Kong. He said people told him the soldier had killed
children and women.
   ``We were shot at by the tanks at the Peking Hotel doorway. They
were shooting at anything that moved,'' said Yves Robert, a French
tour guide, after arriving in Paris with a group of 40 tourists.
   ``I came out to the veranda of the Minzu Hotel to see what was
happening and gunfire from a tank hit the veranda about 50
centimeters (20 inches) above my head,'' Japanese businessman
Ryoichi Kikukawa said in Tokyo.
   Peter White, an English teacher from Ithaca, N.Y., got up before
dawn Wednesday to line up for a ticket on the same Japan Airlines
flight.
   As he was about to enter a taxi in front of his hotel, White
said, he threw himself to the ground because of gunfire from
soldiers, which shattered windows on upper floors. ``I think it was
their way of telling us to get back inside,'' he said.
   White expressed concern for 20 American friends, including a
pregnant woman, he believed were still in Beijing.
   In Frankfurt, Donald Pierre-Louis said: ``There's chaos, even
panic, at the airport. Everybody is trying to leave'' Beijing.
   Pierre-Louis, a 34-year-old a native of Haiti, arrived with his
wife Danielle and their two young children.
   He said they kept up with events by watching American cable
television at their hotel.
   ``They cut off our phones for nearly two days but for some reason
they left the television on,'' he said. ``The more we saw the more
afraid we got.''
   Carol Benedict, a graduate student at Stanford University who was
doing research in Beijing, said in Tokyo: ``Gasoline is a problem.''
She said her taxi driver said he had only enough for one more trip
``and all the gasoline stations are closed.''
   One American woman who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday had been in
a dormitory where soldiers entered firing guns, killing a number of
students, according to her friends. She was too upset to talk to a
reporter.
   ``The airline offices were just two blocks from our hotel, but
with all the tanks out there and gunfire it was too long a walk to
risk,'' said Benedict.
   An American professor at Beijing University was stopped along
with eight other Americans in a van on the road to the airport by
Chinese soldiers who took their baggage, money, tickets and vehicle.
The group had to walk an hour further to the airport, the teacher
told Junichi Nagano, a Japan Airlines supervisor at Narita airport,
near Tokyo.
   Many others on China Airlines flight 925 also arrived in Tokyo
with no baggage or money, Nagano said.
   Ms. Benedict told of a group of seven American students who tried
to stick together in their efforts to escape, helped by a Japanese
student who found them airline tickets. But he could get them only
three tickets, and ``we had to leave the other four behind,''
Benedict said.
   ``The last we knew they were out on Changan Avenue trying to get
to the airline offices, but that was where the heaviest fighting was
going on. I don't know what happened to them,'' she said.
   She said the lack of reliable information was the main problem.
``It was very difficult to get phone calls through. People were
getting hysterical,'' said Benedict, who moved around trying to find
a safe spot in Beijing clutching a shortwave radio to get BBC
reports on what was happening in various parts of the city.
   ``There were hordes of people at the airport, it was hot and
humid, kids everywhere, people near panic, thinking `today I have to
get out at all costs,''' she said, adding that she heard loud booms
that sounded like artillery fire within range of the airport.
   Some embassies, under gunfire, seemed overwhelmed with the task
of evacuating their citizens, leaving some feeling stranded.
   ``The American embassy made it very clear that transportation
arrangements were up to us,'' said White, who said he was worried as
other embassies pulled out their students, leaving him at his
university as the last foreigner, with no clear directions from the
embassy whether to stay or leave.
   The U.S. embassy sent a convoy to bring American students to
safety Monday, but some students, unsure whether they were safer on
campuses, where army units were rumored to be preparing a strike, or
downtown where gunfire was already rife, stayed behind.
   Chinese cheered the American convoy of a half-dozen vehicles led
by a limousine flying an American flag, and flashed victory signs as
it wound through the city trying to find a safe route, Benedict said.
   ``Chinese people are clearly looking to the American government
and the American people for support, and that seems to put American
citizens at risk because the (Chinese) government will try to
suppress that kind of thinking,'' she said.

   New House Speaker Tom Foley said Wednesday that
Republicans are right in complaining Democrats have at times
overplayed their power as the majority party, and he vowed to wield
a gentler gavel.
   ``I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we
were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power
of the majority or the position of the majority,'' Foley said. ``I
don't think we should do that.''
   Foley, in his first full day as speaker, commented in an
interview with news service reporters.
   He specifically referred to an incident on Sept. 27, 1987, when
then-Speaker Jim Wright held open a House roll-call vote long enough
to get one Democrat to change his vote on a crucial budget bill and
provide the margin of victory. ``I think we went too far on that
day,'' he said.
   Foley's comment seemed to concede a point made a day earlier,
when he was sworn in before the full House, by Republican Leader
Robert Michel of Illinois. Michel said then, ``Thirty-five years of
uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the
restraints of civility and comity.''
   In a wide-ranging interview, Foley also said:
   _He hopes to enact, before the year is out, legislation to reform
House ethics rules and campaign laws. Such legislation probably
would have to address the issues of honoraria, or speaking fees, and
a federal pay increase.
   He said the ethics committee's enforcement process is ``somewhat
awkward, to put it kindly,'' and suggested its duties be divided
between two panels _ one to determine whether to bring charges,
another to judge the merits of the case.
   But Foley said he did not think Congress was mired in ``a moral
swamp'' because of recent high-profile ethics cases involving his
predecessor, Wright, and No. 3 Democratic leadership official Rep.
Tony Coelho, both of whom have announced they will leave Congress.
   _As speaker, he will be a staunch supporter of civil rights and
civil liberties, and will be devoted to improving educational
opportunities in the United States. He said the nation is falling
behind countries such as Japan and South Korea in math and science
education, in particular.
   _A combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be needed
to bring the nation's deficit under control, but Democrats will not
on their own suggest a tax hike.
   Foley said such a tax recommendation would be ``an exercise in
futility for all of us'' since, if Congress sent a tax increase to
the White House, President Bush would likely ``shoot it twice and
throw it down the White House well.''
   _It is time to concentrate on governing. He decried political
operatives in both parties who he said spend their days searching
for confrontation and ``seem to want a sort of permanent election.''
He added that Americans don't want ``to make Washington a permanent
political battleground.''
   Meanwhile, Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican Policy Committee, said if Foley is serious about
bipartisanship he should support a package of rule changes proposed
by the GOP five months ago. Democrats ``totally ignored the
proposals under Wright's leadership,'' he said.
   ``There is a new leader and Tom Foley has a different style,''
Edwards said, adding that Wright ``systematically excluded the
views, opinion, debate, amendments of people who disagreed with the
leadership, whether Democrats or Republicans.''
   Earlier, Foley went to the White House for his second meeting
with Bush in as many days, praising the president's willingness to
consult. He said the luncheon was largely social, although a few
issues coming before Congress soon were discussed generally.
   He brushed aside Republican criticism, including a Republican
National Committee memo that stirred considerable controversy.
   Early Wednesday, the GOP committee announced the resignation of
its communications director, Mark Goodin, who had written a memo
titled ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet'' that compared
Foley's voting record to that of Rep. Barney Frank, an acknowledged
homosexual.
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president had been
``disgusted by this entire incident'' and had called RNC Chairman
Lee Atwater who had telephoned Foley to apologize.
   ``He repudiated the statement and apologized,'' Foley told
reporters at the Capitol. ``I accepted that,'' along with a promise
that such attacks would not recur.
   Foley was sworn in as the House's 49th speaker on Tuesday to
replace Wright, who stepped down after the ethics committee lodged
charges of financial impropriety.
   Foley and House GOP Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., went to the
White House for lunch with Bush, and Foley sought to focus attention
on legislative matters the House is taking up or will soon consider.
   Foley called the meeting with Bush a sign of a budding
cooperative spirit between the executive and legislative branches
and between the parties.
   ``The president is seeking opinions,'' he said, specifically
referring to clean air legislation. ``It's another example of this
president's willingness to consult fully.''
   Foley also sought to refocus attention on the Democratic agenda
of social issues, mentioning child care, health care, and an
increase in the minimum wage. ``That's what the American people
elected the Congress to address,'' he said.
   Foley appointed Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., to be acting majority
leader until next Wednesday, when the Democrats will fill the No. 2
leadership post as well as the No. 3 slot of majority whip.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is favored to replace Foley as
majority leader, but is opposed by Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga. There is a
three-way race for whip, the post Coelho is vacating because of his
own ethics controversy. Reps. William Gray, D-Pa., David Bonior,
D-Mich., and Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., are seeking that post.

   East German police broke up a pro-democracy
demonstration Wednesday and arrested more than 120 people protesting
alleged election fraud by communist authorities.
   An Associated Press reporter saw massive security forces move
against about 300 demonstrators, many carrying banners, outside a
church in downtown East Berlin.
   The demonstration was organized by the Lutheran Church, and the
protesters were mostly young people and students. The group planned
to march from Sophie's Church to the government headquarters to
deliver a petition protesting the alleged election fraud, church
sources said.
   The protesters accused communist authorities of election fraud
during the May 7 nationwide municipal elections. Only unopposed
Communist Party candidates ran, and church officials say authorities
did not report all the ``no'' votes.
   Security forces tried to prevent Western reporters from filming
the demonstration, hit some of them and ordered them to leave the
area around the church.
   Michael Passauer, a priest in the church, said he had been
promised by authorities that the 120 arrested would be released
during the night after their names had been taken down.
   Church sources also said police arrested 16 people carrying
flowers and wreaths to on the Chinese Embassy late Tuesday to
protest the military attack on unarmed citizens in Beijing. The
protesters were charged with disorderly conduct and threatening
public order.
   East Germany is one of Eastern Europe's most rigidly controlled
societies, and its state-run media have expressed support for the
military crackdown in Beijing.

<HEAD>GAO Says Military Using Consultants for Wide Range of Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators said Wednesday that
the Air Force is relying on outside consultants rather than its own
personnel to determine the cost of the $6.8 billion system of
rail-garrison MX missiles.
   Officials from the General Accounting Office, an investigating
arm of Congress, told a House panel that the Army, Navy and Air
Force use consultants for a wide range of services.
   The total number, however, is likely higher than the agency found
because the definition of consultant varies and many contractors do
not report whether consultants worked on certain programs,
investigators said.
   The House Armed Services subcommittee on investigations,
responding to last summer's ``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of
military purchasing fraud, had asked the agency to look into the
Pentagon's use of consultants.
   The GAO studied one weapon system from each of the three services
_ the Army's $3.2 billion Fiber Optic Guided Missile program; the
Navy's V-22 Osprey, a $26 billion tilt-rotor aircraft program, and
the Air Force's system to deploy the land-based, nuclear MX missile
on railroad cars.
   The Ballistic Systems Division, which manages the MX program,
awarded 15 contracts worth about $99 million for support services
during fiscal 1987 and 1988, said Harold J. Johnson, director of
manpower issues in the GAO national security and international
affairs division.
   The support contractors provided cost estimates, reviews of
contractor logistic support plans and helped determine system and
component specifications.
   The GAO report prompted Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.,
chairman of the subcommittee, to question who estimates the cost of
the MX rail-garrison _ the Air Force or the consultants hired by the
service.
   ``The best we can tell it's the consultants that they have hired
do the estimating. The Air Force reviews and approves,'' Johnson
said.
   ``Who are the experts _ the consultants or the people we have in
the Air Force?'' Mavroules said.
   Johnson said the Air Force has told the agency that ``the
contractor in this case has the institutional memory and the
expertise.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat also expressed dismay over the
Pentagon's inability to keep track of the consultants, the absence
of a specific definition of the term consultant and the possibility
that these problems could result in incidents of
conflict-of-interest.
   Allan Burman, deputy administrator and acting administrator in
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, said his agency has come
up with a policy letter on conflict-of-interest that will require a
60-day comment period.
   Nevertheless, Mavroules was angered by the absence of a tracking
system for consultants.
   ``What in God's name is so difficult? Why is this a hot potato
that when we ask the question we cannot get an answer? Is the
bureaucracy that great?'' Mavroules said, his voice rising.
   ``You categorize, you prioritize, you have certain numbers of
people working for the government. You have a defense industry
you're in touch with everyday. Don't they have an obligation to give
to you the proper information with regard to that question. I want
to know. I have a right to know. The American people have a right to
know. Why can't I get that from you?'' the congressman said.
   Burman said that with the number of broad categories it is
difficult for consultants looking at those categories to determine
whether they are part of the process.
   ``It's very difficult for us to get any kind of consistency,'' he
said.
   Col. John P. Wilhelm, acting director of the Defense Department's
Advisory and Assistance Services for the past two years, told
Mavroules that there is ``no incentive to report this information
because what happens if they don't report it.''

   President Bush said Wednesday he will nominate
Michael R. Deland, regional administrator in Boston for the
Environmental Protection Agency, as chairman of the president's
Council on Environmental Quality.
   The selection of Deland, a 47-year-old lawyer who has gained a
reputation as a strong enforcer of environmental laws, brought
praise from several environmental groups.
   The three-member council was established in 1970 to advise the
president on environmental matters and has few statutory powers. One
of the Reagan administraion's first acts was a drastic cut in the
council's staff, and the council did little in the eight years of
the Reagan administration.
   ``Mike Deland is a first rate environmentalist and I think he's
an outstanding choice,'' said Jay Hair, head of the National
Wildlife Federation. ``The bigger question is whether or not the
president will give him both the resources and the respect in order
to revitalize, rebuild and redirect the CEQ.''
   Deland has been mentioned as a possible Republican gubernatorial
candidate in Massachusetts and was considered a leading candidate
for the job of EPA administrator earlier this year.
   Since his appointment in Boston in 1983, he has found himself at
odds with EPA headquarters several times for his aggressive
pro-environmental positions, notably on the question of whether it
would be safe to drill for oil and gas off the New England coast.
   During last year's presidential race, Deland added fuel to the
Bush campaign's attack on Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for
failing as Massachusetts governor to clean up Boston Harbor. But
while Deland criticized Dukakis for delaying the cleanup, he
acknowleged that EPA under the Republican administration also shared
the blame. When Bush took reporters on a boatride through the
polluted harbor, Deland refused to go along.
   In another clash with the Dukakis state administration, Deland
blocked the development of a shopping mall in Attleboro, Mass.,
arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important wetlands.
   Deland also clashed with then New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, now
White House chief of staff, over a proposed development on that
state's Loon Mountain.
   Since then, Deland has supported a proposed moratorium on new
development on Cape Cod.
   ``Deland is a very strong environmentalist'' whose selection is
``very much a positive step,'' said David Gardiner of the Sierra
Club's Washington office.
   Gardiner and other environmenalists said it was too early to tell
whether the council, which wielded considerable clout in the late
1970s under President Carter, would regain influence.
   ``I assume he (Deland) would not have taken the job if he had not
had some assurances of what the CEQ's authority would be,'' said
Gardiner. The council's influence largely will be ``a question of
staffing and money,'' he added.
   Deland is a graduate of Harvard College and Boston Colege Law
School. He worked for the president of the University of
Massachusetts, on the EPA's legal staff and as a private consultant
before being named regional administrator for EPA. Unsuccessful back
surgery several years ago forces him to rely on a wheelchair most of
the time.
   The president has not announced his choices for the other two
council positions.

<HEAD>Bush Due to Announce New Head of Export-Import Bank</HEAD>

   President Bush is expected to announce the
appointment soon of John D. Macomber as president of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, which subsidizes loans overseas for buying
American goods, government officials said Wednesday.
   The officials spoke on condition they not be identified.
   The bank competes with similar government organizations in other
industrial countries, especially Japan, France, Britain and Canada.
   Macomber, 61, is chairman of J.D. Macomber &amp; Co., a private
investment firm. He was head of Celanese Corp. when it was acquired
by Hoechst AG of West Germany in 1987.
   A graduate like Bush of Yale University, he chairs the advisory
board of its School of Management and is a director of several
companies in Europe and the United States.
   The bank has lost money in recent years because it made many
loans at lower interest rates than it had to pay for the money in
the first place.
   It has also come under criticism from the General Accounting
Office because it continues to list among its assets loans it made
long ago to Cuba and China. These loans have been repudiated by Cuba
and China.
   The bank nevertheless has strong support in Congress because of
the business supported by its billions of dollars in loans since
1934.

<HEAD>Premier Promises Defense Cuts, Social Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to include Ryzhkov reappointed by Supreme
Soviet; ADDS 1 graf with other appointments</HEAD>

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Wednesday the
government will make huge cuts in military spending, spur the
economy and provide help for the nearly 40 million Soviet citizens
who live in poverty.
   He also said the war in Afghanistan cost the treasury the
equivalent of $8 billion a year. The Red Army was involved in the
war for nine years and completed its withdrawal Feb. 15.
   Speaking to the Congress of People's Deputies after being
reappointed premier by the smaller Supreme Soviet legislature,
Ryzhkov said the government would reduce defense spending by 33
percent to 50 percent by 1995.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress last week the
Soviet Union spends 77.3 billion rubles on defense, the equivalent
of $118 billion a year at the official exchange rate. That is almost
four times the amount previously acknowledged.
   Ryzhkov, premier since September 1985, gave the first public
breakdown of that spending.
   He said the equivalent of $49.7 billion is earmarked for arms and
equipment purchases; $23.4 billion for research and development;
$30.8 billion for maintenance of the army and navy; $7 billion for
development of the armed forces; $3.5 billion for pensions and $3.5
billion for other needs.
   Ryzhkov also promised pensions would be increased next year for
20 million retirees, with the new minimum pension raised to 70
rubles, the equivalent of $107 a month. Some retirees now barely
survive on as little as 30 rubles, $45 a month.
   ``The government is aware that almost 40 million people are now
living below the poverty line,'' Ryzhkov said, which he defined as
an income of 75 rubles, the equivalent of $114 a month or less.
   Explaining why the economic crisis seems to have worsened during
his four-year tenure, he said that among many other factors, the
Chernobyl nuclear accident cost the country 8 billion rubles and the
Soviets' 8{-year involvement in Afghanistan 5 billion rubles yearly,
the equivalent of $8 billion.
   He told deputies the ``iceberg of colossal problems and
difficulties'' Gorbachev inherited in 1985 ``could not be melted in
four years even by the most active restructuring.''
   Ryzhkov said social reform also would include abolition of
special medical care for privileged officials, including the
celebrated Health Ministry's Chief Fourth Directorate that provides
service to top party and government figures.
   Earlier, Ryzhkov was bombarded with questions for more than two
hours as Soviet lawmakers took advantage of their newly won right to
call Kremlin leaders to account for the country's economic and
environmental woes.
   Before political reforms championed by Gorbachev went into effect
last fall, the old Supreme Soviet legislature was a rubber-stamp
body that meekly listened to speeches by top state and Communist
Party officials and ratified any measure put before it.
   But lawmakers grilled Ryzhkov on issues ranging from consumer
goods shortages to the state bureaucracy in charge of the
chronically ailing farm sector.
   In other legislative action Wednesday, Gorbachev rejected an
attempt by several lawmakers to name maverick Communist leader Boris
N. Yeltsin head of a government watchdog agency in place of
Gorbachev's own choice.
   Gorbachev had proposed Gennady A. Kolbin, party chief of the
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, to head the People's Control
Committee, which oversees government planning and spending. But a
parade of Supreme Soviet deputies took the floor to propose Yeltsin
for the job.
   They praised Yeltsin's reputation for independence and battling
corruption, which they said made him better suited for the post.
   Gorbachev, however, insisted on his constitutional right to name
his own candidate, subject to the legislature's consent.
   After permitting more than an hour of debate, Gorbachev moved to
cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted in
overwhelming confirmation of Kolbin.
   Gorbachev told the session earlier he and Yeltsin had already
discussed Yeltsin's role in the Supreme Soviet and settled upon the
chairmanship of an important committee on construction and
architecture.
   In the question-and-answer session before the vote on Ryzhkov,
Siberian deputy Yuri Komarov commented that Gosagroprom, an
agricultural superministry created at the start of Gorbachev's
reforms and abolished in March, worked so inefficiently that
``people were saying it was the most successful action by the CIA
against the Soviet economy.'
   Deputy Anatoly Miloserdny of Byelorussia blamed the Council of
Ministers that Ryzhkov heads for short-sightedness that he said led
to ``the disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.''
   Ryzhkov conceded ``some specific mistakes that had a negative
effect on the economy.''
   Ryzhkov was elevated to the Politburo shortly after Gorbachev
came to power in March 1985, and captured public attention last
December when he headed a Politburo commission overseeing relief
efforts for victims of Armenia's earthquake.
   More recently, Ryzhkov has come under criticism from some
deputies who blame him for the country's environmental problems.
   Deputy Alexei Yablokov, a biologist elected to the Congress by
Moscow-based research institutes, called Ryzhkov an ``ecological
illiterate'' at a news conference last month.
   In other business Wednesday, the Supreme Soviet chose Yevgeny
Smolentsev, head of the Supreme Court of the Russian federation, as
chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court and reappointed Alexander
Sukharev general prosecutor.

   President Bush had a message for the children
of America on Wednesday: go fish.
   ``Fishing is an especially valuable experience for our younger
generation,'' Bush said in a message marking June 5-11 as National
Fishing Week.
   ``Today, more than ever, it is important to instill in our
children a sense of appreciation and responsibility for stewardship
of our lands and waters,'' said Bush, an avid fisherman.
   ``One brisk morning spent fishing on a misty lake can bring home
to a child the beauty, drama and fragility of our natural heritage
in a way a thousand classroom presentations never could,'' he said.
   The White House said 60 million Americans, a quarter of the
population, fish.

   The army on Wednesday blew
up the home of a Palestinian youth convicted of throwing firebombs
and said it wanted to instill fear in other Arab protesters.
   Also Wednesday, a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel was hacked to death with a hatchet and his naked body chained
from an electricity pole in the West Bank city of Nablus, Arab
reports said.
   The army confirmed the slaying and said police were
investigating. The dead man was identified as 30-year-old Ziad Abu
Ras, the 48th suspected collaborator killed by fellow Arabs since
the uprising began.
   At least 509 Palestinians have been killed since uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in December
1987. Twenty-two Israelis also have died in the violence.
   In an unusual move, the army invited reporters to this Gaza
village of 13,000 to witness a house demolition.
   The United States and human rights organizations have condemned
house demolitions, saying they constitute collective punishment and
deny people due process.
   According to the Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man human rights
group on the West Bank, the army has destroyed or sealed more than
330 houses in the West Bank and 58 in the Gaza Strip since the start
of the uprising.
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Hanan Rubin said the army wanted to
publicize the action so ``they (Palestinians) will see and fear.''
   The home was the residence of 17-year-old Bassam Shaaban Ibrahim
Mukasi, who was convicted in a military court of leading Molotov
cocktail attacks on Israeli troops in a nearby refugee camp, Rubin
said. No one was injured in the attacks, he said.
   A deafening explosion sent debris flying high in the air and
showered the rocks that held the tin roof on neighboring houses. The
owners of several nearby houses said their windows were shattered by
the blast and debris.
   The house, which was home to 17 people, was reduced to rubble in
a matter of seconds.
   Mukasi's father, Shaaban, told The Associated Press that
destroying his house was ``a crime.''
   ``If they think by demolishing my house they will scare me, then
they are dealing with the wrong person,'' he said.
   He added: ``I am going to live in a tent. I will continue my
fight.''
   The army also bulldozed the Beit Lahia home of 19-year-old Akilan
Suleiman Bamilat, who also was convicted in the firebomb attacks,
Rubin said.
   Reporters were not invited to watch the bulldozing.
   The house demolitions came as the army confined the 700,000
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip to their homes for the fourth
straight day.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded 15 Palestinians during clashes
Wednesday in the occupied territories, Arab reports said. One of the
injured, a 19-year-old from Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza, was in
critical condition with a bullet wound in the head, hospital
officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, a confrontation between a Jewish
settler and several Palestinian women kicked off a melee that ended
when an Arab-driven car crashed, seriously injuring the driver and
hurting a passenger.
   The settler, Anat Cohen, told Israel radio that ``There was a
group of Arab women who cursed us, so I asked them to apologize.
They refused, and I hit one.''
   Nearby, the Arab-driven car turned around. Settlers told the
radio it attempted to run Ms. Cohen down, but Arabs said the driver
lost control when he was hit by rubber bullets fired by a soldier.
   Ms. Cohen was struck by the car, treated for minor leg bruises
and released.
   In the town of Qalqilya to the north, masked Arab youths
seriously injured a 45-year-old Palestinian woman and her
17-year-old daughter who were accused of aiding Israeli authorities.
The women were beaten with clubs and chains and stabbed with a
knife, Arab reports said.

   The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it
will stop issuing visas because results of May 7 elections were not
respected.
   Non-immigrant visas will not be issued after Friday, an embassy
statement said. Immigrant visas will be processed through July, it
said.
   ``These measures were considered necessary because the regime of
(Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega brutally ignored the will freely
expressed by the Panamanian people,'' an embassy statement said.
   It said the visa service was being stopped so embassy consular
personnel could use their time ``to protect the interests of United
States citizens.''
   Panamanians and others who need visas for the United States will
have to obtain them in consulates in third countries, it said.
   The embassy will continue to issue visas for other foreign
diplomats in Panama, it said.
   International observers say Noriega, who as head of the Defense
Forces is the country's de facto leader, rigged the election in
support of his candidate, then ordered its results annulled when the
fraud became obvious.
   The three opposition presidential and vice presidential
candidates were beaten by government thugs after the election.
   The United States has been pressuring for Noriega's ouster since
February 1988 when he was indicted on federal drug trafficking
charges in Florida and engineered the ouster of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked nine
military posts early Wednesday and claimed to have killed or wounded
six police in a raid on a coffee processing plant.
   The army confirmed the attacks on its outposts and said the only
casualty was a civilian wounded at San Miguel de Mercedes, 47 miles
north of the capital in Chalatenango province.
   A broadcast on Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said
guerrillas damaged the plant, an electrical substation and a
warehouse of the coffee-processing operation at Chalchuapa in Santa
Ana province, 48 miles northwest of San Salvador.
   An Associated Press reporter who visited the scene found only the
warehouse damaged. A plant employee said the rebels launched 14
grenades but did not fire their rifles and there were no casualties.
   Venceremos also reported fighting in the eastern provinces of
Usulutan and Morazan, and in San Vicente in central El Salvador.
   The army said guerrillas killed five civilians they accused of
collaborating with the army.
   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed since the civil war began nine years ago.

   A Cabinet minister on Wednesday reproached
three men who plan to pursue suits against the state for wrongful
confinement and torture after being detained for more than a year
without trial or charge.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Robert Ouko said that David Mukara
Ng'ang'a, a former lecturer in political science at the University
of Nairobi, and lawyers Wanyiri Kihoro and Kariuki Mirugi failed to
appreciate the pardons granted them by President Daniel arap Moi.
   ``Defiance is not the way to respond to magnanimity,'' Ouko said.
``They should abandon those intentions and express gratitude to the
president.''
   The three were among seven detainees freed June 1 and June 6. Moi
said no more political prisoners remained in Kenyan jails, a
contention disputed by Amnesty International, the London-based human
rights organization.
   Amnesty says at least 60 political prisoners are still held
following court convictions based on tainted confessions.
   The four others freed were Raila Odinga, son of former Vice
President Oginga Odinga; business executive Israel Otieno Agina;
Richard Obuon Guya, a former air force private, and Samuel Okumu
Okwany, who was implicated in a trial of people charged with seeking
guerrila warfare training in Libya.
   All seven were arrested between 1986-88 in a government crackdown
on clandestine groups allegedly plotting Moi's overthrow. They were
imprisoned under the Preservation of Public Order and Security Act,
which permits indefinite confinement without trial or charge.
   Kihoro, Ng'ang'a and Mirugi first filed suits against the state
in 1987 and 1988, alleging torture and challenging their detention.
   Their lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, was arrested the day after he
filed the 1987 suits and spent eight months in detention. Kuria told
The Associated Press he is pursuing the cases.

   Feuding Democrats and Republicans reached
agreement Wednesday to clear the way for a committee vote on the
controversial nomination of Donald Gregg to be ambassador to South
Korea, a key participant said.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
who has spurred an investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee into Gregg's alleged links to the Iran-Contra affair,
agreed to schedule a vote for June 20 if the Bush administration
produces all requested documents and information by June 16.
   As a result, McConnell said, he is calling off a one-day
Republican boycott of committee meetings, thus permitting the panel
to act on this and other key nominations as well as a pending $2.5
billion State Department authorization bill.
   ``If the administration doesn't produce the documents, obviously
the deal would be off,'' McConnell said.
   But he said State Department officials who were present at his
meeting with Cranston promised that the material would be produced
by the deadline.
   McConnell said he obtained a written agreement that the vote on
Gregg will be held, even if Cranston is not satisfied with the
materials he recieves.
   ``If he isn''t satisfied, then he can use that as an argument to
vote against the nomination,'' McConnell said. ``But there still
will be a vote.''
   Cranston, meanwhile, will question Gregg under oath for a second
time at a hearing to be held on June 15.
   Cranston and other senators are suspicious of Gregg's contacts
with former national security council official Oliver L. North and
other Iran-Contra figures in 1985 when Gregg served as Bush's vice
presidemntial national security adviser.
   The questions central to the investigation are:
   _Did Gregg help North illegally resupply the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels with military aid?
   _Is he lying about it now?
   Gregg maintains he had no role in supplying the Contras and that
he is telling the truth about what he did and did not do. He has
said he wants to use the hearings to clear the air and remove all
suspicions about his conduct.
   McConnell said he led the Republican boycott of the committee on
Wednesday to prevent committee action on nominations and legislation
because he feared Gregg was being railroaded.
   ``This nomination has been up here since early March and I've
told Sen. Cranston that I thought they were trying to kill the
nomination with delays,'' McConnell said. ``What I was unwilling to
see continue was the effort to kill the nomination with delays and
leaks.''
   McConnell said he is optimistic that the Gregg nomination can
still be approved.
   ``But I think this has been made into a partisan matter so we'll
have to wait and see,'' he said.
   The end of the GOP boycott apparently will permit votes Thursday
morning on the State Department bill and nominations of Bernard
Aronson to be assistant secretary of State for Latin American
Affairs, John Kelly to be assistant secretary of State for Middle
Eastern and South Asian Affairs and former Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev.,
to be ambassador to the Bahamas.

   A tornado hit a Texas elementary school Wednesday, injuring a
child, and flooding forced residents of an Oklahoma city to evacuate
as thunderstorms dumped heavy rain and hail as big as baseballs on
the two states.
   Rain and thunderstorms were widespread across the East Coast,
thunderstorms fell in sections of Minnesota and Wisconsin and
thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on the Sierra foothills east of
Sacramento, Calif.
   Clear skies prevailed from the Pacific Northwest to Arizona and
New Mexico, and from southern Michigan to the lower Ohio Valley.
   In Coppell, Texas, just northwest of Dallas, a twister struck
Pinkerton Elementary School and two businesses. Forty children were
at the school, and one suffered bruises and cuts from flying glass.
   A tornado in Clyde in north central Texas destroyed two barns and
a trailer, but no injuries were reported. Winds up to 70 mph howled
over the region, blowing over a mobile home, destroying roofs and
storage buildings and downing trees and power lines.
   Baseball-size hail knocked out windows and damaged roofs near
Clifton northwest of Waco. Homes were flooded in the Fort Worth area.
   In Oklahoma, lightning struck an oil storage tank in Yukon,
sparking a fire that destroyed a second tank and threatened a third
tank saved by firefighters. In Shawnee, eight to 10 families
evacuated their homes as the Canadian River overflowed into their
low-lying neighborhood. Penny-size hail fell near Warren.
   Northwest Louisiana, northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas have
been drenched by 10 to 25 inches of rain in the last 30 days, and
more rain was expected in the next couple of days. Flash flood
watches were in effect in much of Oklahoma, northeast Texas and
southwest Arkansas.
   In the East, more than an inch of rain fell in an hour in
Christiansburg, Va., and a small-stream flood watch was in effect
for the Philadelphia area through Thursday morning. In Pine Level,
N.C., thunderstorms generated golf ball-size hail.
   The storms over Minnesota and Wisconsin packed winds gusting to
49 mph and golf ball-size hail, while those in the central
California foothills dropped half an inch of rain in 40 minutes in
Placerville. A flash flood watch was in effect for parts of the
eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
   In Michigan, a cold front produced a sharp temperature contrast.
It was 85 degrees in Iron Mountain, but less than 100 miles to the
north at Houghton it was just 46.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 100 degrees at Del Rio, Texas. The low
in the 48 contiguous states was 31 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for showers and thunderstorms
stretching across the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Mississippi
Valley and the Great Lakes region; a few thunderstorms in the
central Rockies; and dry weather from western New York to the Ohio

   Adult barn swallows and cliff swallows
swooped and screeched Wednesday as two biologists carefully removed
seven newborn birds and about 120 eggs from nests under two bridges
scheduled for demolition.
   The birds and eggs found in about 60 nests had to be removed
under provisions of the U.S. Migratory Bird Act before the bridges
could be torn down, said state Department of Transportation
spokeswoman Cheryl Plathe.
   The two species are extremely abundant birds but are covered
under the act, as are all migratory birds, said Carrol Henderson of
the state Department of Natural Resources.
   ``We're doing this to fulfill the federal requirements,'' said
Plathe. ``We hope we don't have to do this to every bridge in the
future.''
   As the nests were demolished, the adult birds flew around the
area frantically.
   ``They don't like their homes being torn down. But it's something
we have to do to give the public a better ride,'' said Bill Langston
of the Transportation Department.
   The $2.6 million road project includes two new, wider bridges and
repaving of about seven miles of state Highway 22 about 60 miles
west of Minneapolis near Hutchinson.
   Construction engineers watched as the biologists, working as
volunteers, removed eggs and bird babies before tearing the nests
from the underside of the steel bridges over the Crow River and
scraping remaining mud and straw from the bridge.
   The babies and eggs were taken to the University of Minnesota's
Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic in St. Paul for nursing and
incubation.
   However, the chance of survival for the newborns was slim, as was
the chance the eggs would hatch after being disturbed, said Linda
Wolf, a clinic biologist who helped in the removal.
   ``If we get 10 healthy hatches out of the eggs, I'd be
surprised,'' Wolf said.
   The baby birds, each only about an inch long and not yet
feathered, will require feeding by hand every 20 minutes from dawn
to dusk by volunteers using tiny syringes, Wolf said.
   While efforts are being made to save their young, the adult
swallows will be looking for a place to build new nests and should
lay another set of eggs in two to three weeks, Wolf said.
   Swallows can build new nests in about three days, Plathe said, so
contractors will have to knock any new nests from the bridges until
they're torn down. One bridge was scheduled for demolition Thursday,
the other in two weeks.
   ``In the future, we have to determine how to keep birds from
nesting under bridges,'' Plathe said.
   ``We should have been out here this spring and hosed them off
before they laid their eggs. But we didn't and they're here, so
that's why we're doing this,'' she said.

<HEAD>Surgery Improves Marcos' Abdominal Pain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Surgery eased abdominal pain and a persistent
fever plaguing Ferdinand Marcos, but the ousted Philippine president
remained in very critical condition Wednesday, a hospital spokesman
said.
   ``It's not like this was the only source and now the infection is
gone, but there was some response to the treatment and the pain and
the fever appears to have decreased,'' said Eugene Tiwanak, a St.
Francis Medical Center administrator.
   Marcos, 71, underwent three hours of emergency, exploratory
surgery Tuesday in which doctors drained a pancreatic abscess
considered a source of a bacterial infection complicating treatment
of his widespread organ failure.
   Marcos suffered cardiac, kidney and pulmonary failure May 18, and
since has been in very critical and unstable condition. The pancreas
helps break down food and produces hormones necessary to regulate
the body's metabolism.
   The exiled leader remained on life-support equipment Wednesday,
including a respirator to regulate his breathing, Tiwanak said,
adding that Marcos also undergoes hemodialysis four times a week to
cleanse his body of wastes.
   His medical team has been instructed to take any measure to keep
Marcos alive. Aides said the ousted leader's mind remains clear and
that he makes his own decisions.
   ``Just because he can't talk, he can't breathe, doesn't mean he
can't think,'' said adviser Arturo Aruiza, adding that Marcos agreed
to the surgery.
   Tiwanak said no further surgery was planned and doctors had not
determined whether the abscess was a major source of the infection.
   Marcos has lived in exile in Honolulu since a popular revolt
catapulted Corazon Aquino to the Philippine presidency three years
ago.
   Aquino, widow of assassinated Marcos foe Benigno Aquino, has
repeatedly denied the pleas of Marcos and his wife, Imelda, to
return home.
   Both Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury and stashing it
in the United States.
   However, a federal judge severed Marcos from the case, meaning he
will not be prosecuted unless he recovers, and no trial date has
been set for Mrs. Marcos, who pleaded innocent to the charges and is
free on $5 million bail.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 and doctors said it
was a ``miracle'' he has survived so long.

   The Senate passed legislation on Wednesday
speeding $3.3 billion to veterans programs and a host of money-short
federal agencies, setting up potentially difficult talks with a
House that passed a different version of the bill.
   Senators approved the bill on a voice vote on the fourth day of
debate.
   Final passage came after lawmakers refused to delay for one year
much of the new Medicare catastrophic health care program for the
elderly. The bill now goes to a conference committee with the House,
which passed its version last month, to iron out differences before
the bill goes to the president.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had led a fight to postpone parts of
the program, including a surtax on senior citizens that has drawn
complaints because of its cost.
   His effort was defeated 51-49 on a procedural vote in which he
was opposed by leaders of both parties.
   Lawmakers, however, did adopt by voice a non-binding provision
offered by the leaders calling on Congress to consider making
changes in the catastrophic care program in future legislation.
There is widespread agreement that the surtax will likely collect
more money than expected, but disputes remain over whittling down
the levy.
   ``Certainly most Americans would rather not have to pay anything
and receive the benefits,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``That's the American way. But we're broke.''
   Earlier, across the Capitol, four House members of both parties
joined members of veterans associations at a news conference to
accuse the Senate of delaying the legislation while senators attach
pet projects to it. The House approved the veterans money, $1.2
billion, on May 24.
   Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte, ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, said the Senate was holding the veterans
funds ``hostage to the pet projects of senators who have included
the veterans money in a Christmas tree of non-emergency
appropriations.''
   Chairman G.V. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee complained that because of the delay, the
Department of Veterans Affairs was already ``gearing down'' some of
its operations.
   ``We've never hollered wolf about this situation at all,'' he
said.
   The spending bill, which President Bush first proposed as a $2.2
billion measure in March, contains money for health care,
compensation increases, and other programs for veterans.
   For want of the money, the veterans agency has begun limiting
out-patient care in less-serious cases, delayed opening new
facilities and halted many maintenance proects and equipment
purchases. The department annually treats around 3.5 million of the
nation's 27 million veterans.
   McCain's amendment, offered Tuesday, would delay for a year the
surtax people over age 65 must pay to help finance the catastrophic
care program. It would also postpone other important parts of the
program, including caps it places on senior citizens' doctors' bills
and a prescription drug benefit.
   Democrats had countered with an alternative calling for changes
to be considered in future legislation.
   The overall measure also contains $892 million for student loans,
$100 million to help refugees move to this country, and finances for
fighting forest fires, United Nations peacekeeping, unemployment
benefits, foster care, and other programs.
   The legislation has picked up a batch of amendments in the
Senate, including several of interest to particular lawmakers.
   One addition would protect a school district in Sumter County,
S.C., from sacrificing about $700,000 in federal aid this year it
would otherwise have to yield because of a loss of students covered
by an assistance program. The clause was sponsored by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., an Appropriations Committee member.
   The bill also contains $75 million to repair a radio telescope in
the home state of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va.; orders the Army to spend $50 million to buy
cold-weather clothing made in 10 states; and sets aside $400,000 to
study last year's fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   The House also added its own favorite provisions to the bill.
These include: language easing the way for Alton, Ill., to lease
land on which it could build a public marina; allowing a $2.5
million increase in spending for cotton and tobacco grading; and
providing up to $360,000 for aviation research at the University of
Minnesota.
   The House bill also contains $822 million not in the Senate
measure for anti-drug programs.

   The voice vote approval came a day after the Senate Governmental

   Newman, 53, is a career federal worker who started in government
as a clerk typist in the Interior Department and rose to become an
assistant secretary of housing and urban development.
   At her confirmation hearing Tuesday, Newman expressed concerns
about widespread drug testing for federal workers that had been
advocated by the Reagan administration. She said she believed drug
testing should be limited to cases where probable cause of abuse are
found and for workers in sensitive jobs such as air traffic
controllers.

   Two congressmen vying to succeed Gov. Thomas
H. Kean started hitting the campaign trail and each other Wednesday,
only hours after their primary victories.
   Democrat James Florio, a winner by 27,000 votes, was at commuter
train station by 7:30 a.m. and talking to more than 1,000 senior
citizens by lunch time. Nearly eight years ago he lost to Kean by
the narrowest margin in state history _ 1,797 votes out of 2.3
million cast.
   Republican James Courter used the day to appear with Kean, who's
still very popular among voters and is considered an important
political ally, even though he differs with Courter on key issues.
   Kean, barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term,
endorsed no primary candidate but filmed commercials for the
frontrunners that aired in a media blitz during the final weeks of
the primary.
   Also decided in New Jersey on Tuesday was a bitter primary for
the Democratic mayoral nomination in Plainfield, where City
Councilman Harold Mitchell upset Mayor Richard L. Taylor by a
198-vote margin, 2,172 to 1,974.
   Taylor, elected mayor in 1985, and Mitchell, a 7-year councilman,
head two factions of the city's Democratic party for years. Their
primary fight this year was the most public show of animosity
between the two popular politicians.
   At one point, both submitted to urine tests to fend off
allegations that they consorted with drug dealers.
   Courter, a conservative who comes from a wealthy family and the
Republican-rich northwestern part of the state, is expert on foreign
affairs and gained national attention as a member of the Iran-Contra
committee.
   Florio, the son of a Brooklyn shipyard worker, has a formidable
political base in southern New Jersey and a national reputation as
an environmentalist.
   Courter said Florio has amassed a ``big spending'' voting record
in Washington and established himself as the head of machine
politics in Camden.
   Courter also backed away from his ``no new taxes'' primary
campaign platform, and said if he ever had to raise taxes it would
be ``only as a last resort'' but he would ``bend over backwards'' to
avoid a tax increase.
   Florio picked up a favorite theme of Courter's Republican primary
opponents and condemned Courter's free-market plan to lower
insurance rates by deregulating the industry.
   While saying political labels serve no purpose, Florio termed
Courter's call for deregulation so politically conservative it was
``off the charts of reasonability.''
   Both candidates promised to spell out where they differ from one
another, and said voters will have some clear choices.

   The Senate narrowly rejected a proposal
Wednesday to delay the start of major provisions of Medicare's new
catastrophic health care coverage, a proposal opponents argued would
have effectively killed the new benefits.
   Reacting to criticism from senior citizens opposed to paying an
income tax surcharge to help pay for the program, backers of the
delay proposal argued that it was unfair to put roughly two-thirds
of the cost of the program on roughly one-third of retired Americans
with enough income to make them subject to income taxes.
   Those who voted against delaying the coverage maintained that
huge federal budget deficits make it impossible to provide new
benefits without providing a way to pay for them and that middle-and
upper-income retired Americans should foot a major share of the cost.
   The surtax could be as much as $800 a year for Medicare-eligible
retirees in upper income ranges.
   In the key vote, the Senate voted 51-49 against an attempt by
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to kill an amendment by Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine that called on the Finance Committee
to review the program while benefits continue on schedule. Mitchell
introduced his amendment as a substitute to McCain's proposal to
delay provisions while a way to reduce the surtax is found.
   The Senate then quickly adopted by voice votes the Mitchell
substitute amendment and attached it to a pending supplemental
appropriations measure to pump $3.3 billion additional money into a
variety of federal programs for the current fiscal year.
   ``Nowhere in my amendment will you find the word repeal, but you
will find the word delay,'' McCain maintained. He termed the
Mitchell amendment a ``smokescreen'' that would not require Finance
Committee action and vowed to continue his fight to in order delay
in implementation of the surtax.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., argued that approving McCain's
delay of some benefits would amount to repeal because it would send
a clear signal to the Finance Committee to let the program languish.
   ``We're going to get wisdom real quick and there is no way you're
going to get this back out of that committee,'' said Durenberger, a
member of the panel that crafted the catastrophic health act.
   The measure cleared the Senate last summer on an 86-11 vote and,
with similarly overwhelming House approval, was signed into law with
great fanfare by President Ronald Reagan who had proposed a more
modest and less expensive version.
   McCain was one of the 11 senators opposing the catastrophic
health measure last year.
   Opponents of the McCain attempt argued that an estimated 59
percent of the 32 million Medicare beneficaries do not have enough
income to qualify for income tax and would pay only $4 a month for
the additional coverage.
   They cited Congressional Budget Office estimates that 70 percent
of those eligible for Medicare would pay $100 or less a year in
additional surtaxes and that only 5.6 percent in upper income levels
would pay the maximum $800 tax.
   The catastrophic coverage took effect Jan. 1 with unlimited
hospitalization coverage after a once-a-year $560 deductible.
However, a $1,370 cap on out-of-pocket doctor bills does not kick in
until next year and a new prescription drug benefit begins a
three-year phase-in period in 1991.
   It was those benefits beginning next January that McCain wanted
to delay, along with the surtax _ or ``supplemental premium'' _ to
finance them. The surtax started this year to build up a trust fund
to pay the new benefits without dipping into the federal treasury.

   Bags of money fell out of an armored car on
a busy highway during rush hour Wednesday and traffic backed up
almost a half-mile when motorists stopped and scrambled for the
cash, police said.
   ``This is an education in greed in people,'' police Officer
Roberto Campos said. ``People were just stopping their cars and
getting out and grabbing money.''
   Police caught at least two people who allegedly took money from
the Loomis Armored Inc. truck, and have license number of others.
   Loomis officials did not take phone calls Wednesday, and it was
not known how much money was in the truck and how much was lost.
   The money spilled out of the back of a Loomis truck on Interstate
10 just east of downtown, said Campos, who was first on the scene.
   Police said some drivers tossed bags of money into their cars,
while others scooped up loose bills that littered the four-lane
highway.
   ``With the turbulence of the traffic, the money was flying in the
air like a Toyota commercial,'' police shift supervisor Hank
DiMatteo said, who added that at least 20 motorists stopped to grab
some cash.
   Campos and his partner, Ed Porterfield, were working undercover
in an unmarked car when they happened upon the accident and saw two
men get out of a pickup and stuff wads of money in their pockets and
pants.
   The two men hopped back in their pickup and drove off, but the
two plainclothes officers were in pursuit. When the men were pulled
over, police found $3,840 on them. The pair had not been formally
charged as of Wednesday afternoon.
   ``They didn't know they were being followed,'' Campos said. ``It
kind of ruined their day _ from the happiest to `I'm going to
jail.'''
   Other people were thought to have gotten away with money bags,
Campos said, adding that police had license numbers of some. He said
anyone caught taking money would be charged with felony theft if
they did not return the cash.
   The half-mile traffic jam dispersed quickly after police arrived,
he said.
   For the next hour or so, police and fire officials collected
$8,800 in stray currency _ mostly $20 bills _ from the roadside.
They found a bag containing $800 in $20 bills in a storm drain.
   In October 1987, about 200 people converged on Interstate 71 near
downtown Columbus, Ohio, after the rear door of a Metropolitan
Armored Car Inc. truck swung open. Bags of cash fell onto the
highway and at least one ripped open.
   The Columbus Dispatch quoted sources as saying more than $1
million was lost. But one man turned in nearly $57,000, saying he
considered keeping the money but could not in good conscience.
Metropolitan gave him a reward of 10 percent of the amount returned.

   One of three men who kidnapped and
buried a bus full of schoolchildren in 1976 was denied parole
Wednesday.
   Richard Schoenfeld, 35, serving a life sentence at the California
Men's Colony here, is still a danger to society, a Board of Prison
Terms panel ruled in refusing the inmate's 10th plea for a parole
date.
   The panel's vote was 2-1: Deputy Commissioner Anthony Smith
argued that a date should be set, but far enough in the future to
exceed the prisoner's life span.
   The board turned aside a lengthy apology from Schoenfeld, who
said: ``I ask that you at least set a date so I can see a light at
the end of the tunnel.''
   He was convicted for his role in the kidnapping and abduction of
26 schoolchildren and their driver from the rural town of Chowchilla
in California's Central Valley for $5 million ransom.
   Schoenfeld, his brother, James, and Frederick N. Woods
commandeered the bus at gunpoint on July 15, 1976, and took it 100
miles to Livermore, outside San Francisco.
   There they shut the victims in a poorly ventilated moving van
buried in a quarry. It took the group 16 hours to dig to safety
through the wood- and earth-covered hole.
   All three inmates are serving life terms.

<HEAD>Because Of Massacre, Cartoonist Kills Week Of Strips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau
withdrew a week of his comic strips after his gentle lampoon of the
student protests for democracy turned tragic with the Beijing
massacres.
   All last week the strip was set in Beijing's Tiananmen Square,
where students had been protesting since April.
   This week Trudeau zeroed in on the controversy over the recently
published diary of the late artist Andy Warhol, but he had planned
to take his characters back to China next week.
   ``Then everything intensified over the weekend, so we killed that
week,'' said Lee Salem, editorial director of the Kansas City-based
Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes the strip. ``The whole
situation blew up.''
   Salem said another week of strips on the China theme, for use
starting June 12, had been sent to newspapers last Friday when the
weekend's events in which hundreds were killed made the cartoons
inappropriate.
   Salem said the substitute strips sent out Sunday provide ``kind
of an obtuse look at the Alaska oil spill.''
   Trudeau told New York Newsday that the premise of the substitute
strips ``is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a whole week's
worth of strips.''
   He told the newspaper that the second week of strips on China was
``predicated on a peaceful resolution.''
   ``That was a very bad miscalculation ... and now obviously
inappropriate,'' he said.

   Hungary became the first Soviet bloc nation to
denounce the crackdown in China, and Taiwan said Wednesday it will
end a 40-year ban on mail and telephone links with the mainland to
help spread reports of the bloodbath.
   Hungarian Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said the military
attack on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last weekend had
shocked his nation.
   Events in China have had special repercussions in Hungary, where
many remember the Soviet military's violent suppression of the 1956
revolt.
   Hundreds, and possibly thousands, died when Chinese troops moved
into Beijing to crush the student movement.
   Grosz said in a statement issued by the official news agency MTI:
``The tragedy in China has shocked Hungarian Socialist Workers'
Party members and Hungarian society as a whole.''
   ``I firmly declare that we deeply condemn violence and
fratricidal war. These methods have nothing to do with socialism.''
   Later, several thousand young people, including Chinese students,
staged a peaceful demonstration outside the Chinese Embassy and gave
a petition the embassy's first secretary promised to pass to Beijing.
   Poland's opposition said more than 2,000 people in the southern
city of Krakow demonstrated Wednesday against the Chinese crackdown
and demanded a clear condemnation from the communist authorities. On
Tuesday, official spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowksi said the government
felt ``deep concern.''
   In Taipei, Taiwan, Communications Minister Chang Chien-pang said
telephone service to 80 cities on the mainland will begin Saturday
through a switching center in Hong Kong, and mail service will start
in a week.
   Chang said this will not change Taiwan's policy of refusing to
have any official contacts with the mainland government because the
telecommunication and postal administrations of the rival
governments will not be directly linked.
   The Nationalists in Taiwan were defeated in a civil war in China
in 1949, but continue to claim they are the legitimate government of
all China. The Nationalists and Communists are technically still at
war.
   Also on Wednesday, the Taiwan government-run Broadcasting Corp.
of China began a 24-hour news broadcast to China on shortwave
channels. The station also established a hot line to receive
telephone calls from Chinese listeners.
   In Miaoli, 75 miles southwest of Taipei, about 10,000 people held
a rally and condemned the mainland government for the killings in
Beijing.
   In an interview by the mass-circulation Bild newspaper of
Hamburg, West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl suggested the ideology
governing China and other socialist nations is dying.
   ``The call for freedom cannot be smashed forever under the weight
of tanks,'' Kohl said. ``Those in power must sooner or later
recognize that economic progress cannot be achieved without human
rights.''
   Dieter Vogel, a spokesman for the West German Economics Ministry,
said ``economic assistance will definitely be affected if it is
determined that the reforms are dead.''
   Vogel said West German companies in China may also take a hard
look at future investment policies.
   A West German relief agency suspended new projects in China to
protest the Chinese government's decision to use force to quell the
popular protests.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry had announced it halted aid projects and
postponed official visits, but said Wednesday this resulted from the
chaos in China and did not reflect a ``policy decision.''
   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China. Assistance,
most in the form of loans, totaled $6.1 billion as of 1987, the
latest figures available.
   Tokyo's reluctance to criticize China mainly stems from its
unwillingness to antagonize its neighbors, who still harbor
resentment against Japan for its actions during World War II.
   Soldiers in Beijing fired in a diplomatic compound on Wednesday
and the State Department ordered the evacuation of all diplomatic
dependents and non-essential personnel. It also urged all other
Americans in the country to leave immediately.
   ``There's been no communication from the leadership. There's no
indication who the leadership is,'' said White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater.
   U.S. officials have mounted a wide-ranging effort _ using spy
satellites, embassy intelligence and interviews with Americans
leaving China _ in an attempt to determine what is going on in the
strife-torn nation.
   In Seoul, South Korea, about 1,000 Chinese students chanting
``democracy'' burned effigies of Chinese communist leaders. Many
carried Taiwanese flags and placards that read ``Sword shall perish
by sword.''
   About 350 Chinese and Filipinos marched to a Chinese consular
office in Manila, where they laid wreaths and called for the
downfall of Chinese Premier Li Peng.
   In England, about 1,000 students marched in Oxford, 50 miles
northwest of London. The Oxford University Students Union said it
was sending 1,000 postcards to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
calling for the withdrawal of Britain's ambassador from Beijing and
trade sanctions against China.
   In Hong Kong, crowds of Chinese residents protested in trucks,
taxis and marches, shouting for the resignation of Chinese leaders.
Officials said the crowd could have been larger if organized rallies
had not been canceled after a riot during the night, when a mob
tried to storm branches of mainland Chinese banks.
   Organizers feared their rallies might trigger further violence,
and urged demonstrators to remain at home or pray at churches for
the Beijing victims. Police said they had no estimate on the number
of protesters, but noted they were usually six abreast and stretched
down several streets.

   A man set free his four imported, 3-inch-long,
hissing cockroaches in this semi-tropical city because he was afraid
the state might jail him and destroy his beloved bugs, a pet store
owner said Wednesday.
   The state Department of Agriculture last week ordered the Critter
Shop to stop selling the Madagascar hissing roaches, fearing if they
got free, they might breed and spread across the South like the
flying Asian cockroach.
   Harold Denmark, chief of entomology in the department's Division
of Plant Industries, said he's concerned about the effect on
Florida's lucrative tourist industry if the hissing insects multiply.
   The man, who bought the four insects in January, said he freed
the roaches in his back yard, said Critter Shop manager Chloe Riley.
   ``He came in and said, `Man, I was scared. I let them loose. I
was afraid they'd put me in jail,''' Ms. Riley said. ``He said he
didn't want the Department of Agriculture to hurt them.''
   She would not identify the man, and said she wouldn't tell the
agriculture department the man's name, either. ``Not me,'' Ms. Riley
said. ``I've got to live in this end of town.''
   Agricultural agents have said they don't know much about the
roaches, which are bred by some zoos and distributed by wholesalers
as food for certain reptiles.
   The Critter Shop got a shipment of 12 of the insects in January
and sold six of the roaches in the first four months, and the rest
in just two days after reports the bugs were trendy, cheap to feed
and easy to maintain.
   ``Now that they say these are a bad thing, everybody wants to buy
them,'' Ms. Riley said. ``Somebody came in today wanting some.''
   Most researchers believe the roaches do not reproduce easily. But
Florida's warm, wet climate might be attractive to the species,
which is at home in tropical and subtropical environments, Denmark
said.
   Attorney William Smalley, a longtime customer of the shop, has
offered to help fight the stop-sale order, which the state said
applied only to the Critter Shop because it's the only store known
to be selling the roaches.
   Smalley said he's checking the order's legality, and so far has
found that ``no one ... knows what to about it.''
   He believes the plant industries division may be out of its
jurisdiction, saying the order cites a plant industry rule and
refers to nursery stock. ``But this roach is not a plant,'' Smalley
said.

   Rebel ambushes killed at least 100 people
in northern Uganda in the past week, a government official said
Wednesday.
   Charles Alai, deputy minister of commerce, said the ambushes were
staged in Gulu Province by Holy Spirit Movement guerrillas.
   ``Some people were killed in attacks on convoys, while others _
especially displaced people who normally frequent the rural areas
from the towns hunting for food _ also fell victim,'' Alai said in
an interview.
   The Holy Spirit Movement was thought to have been crushed in 1987
when its former leader, warrior-priestess Alice Lakena, fled to
neighboring Kenya, where she has been detained.
   Remnants of her movement regrouped in northern Uganda last year,
however, and have evaded army sweeps aimed at stamping them out.

   A jury Wednesday sentenced a 36-year-old
man to death for the torture slayings of six young women whose nude
bodies were found dumped on a remote hillside.
   Dayton Leroy Rogers, 36, shook his head repeatedly as Clackamas
County Circuit Court jurors were polled after 17 hours of
deliberations over two days. ``They didn't follow the rules,'' he
said.
   Judge Raymond Bagley Jr. then formally sentenced Rogers to die by
injection.
   The small-engine repairman, convicted of aggravated murder May 4,
is already serving a life sentence for stabbing a prostitute to
death in a suburban parking lot in 1987.
   ``We're happy justice was done,'' said prosecutor Andrejs Eglitis.
   Defense attorney Christoper Burris said Rogers' case, like all
death penalty cases, are appealed automatically to the state Supreme
Court.
   The six victims were known or suspected prostitutes ranging in
age from 16 to 35 whose bodies were found on a rural hillside near
Molalla about 30 miles southeast of Portland. All were stabbed
repeatedly in the back. Rogers was not charged in the death of a
seventh victim, who has not been identified.
   The feet were sawed from three of the bodies, and one victim was
sliced open from her pubic bone to her sternum.
   During the trial, several prostitutes testified that Rogers took
them to the Mollala area, bound their wrists and angles, and cut or
bit their feet and breasts.
   Aggravated murder is punishable by death or life in prison in
Oregon. To sentence Rogers to death, jurors had to unanimously find
the crimes were deliberate and that the defendant was likely to
commit violence again.
   Rogers' criminal history stretches back to 1972, when he stabbed
a 15-year-old girl with a hunting knife. The girl told police Rogers
proposed marriage to her immediately after the attack.
   Rogers served 27 months in prison between June 1979 and January
1982. He also spent nine months in the Oregon State Hospital in 1974.

   A demonstration by car drivers protesting the
military crackdown in China turned violent early Wednesday as mobs
smashed shop windows and attempted to attack banks linked to
Communist China.
   Up to 4,000 people rioted in the Mongkok and Yaumatei districts
of Hong Kong's sister city of Kowloon, according to police.
   They said rioters hurled stones and bottles at police who
responded with tear gas. Seventeen people, including five policemen,
were injured, according to a police statement.
   It reported a procession of cars was traveling through the zone
with horns honking to protest the killings in China when an object
thrown from a building struck one of the vehicles. A crowd quickly
gathered and some people began rampaging through the streets,
setting fires in garbage cans, smashing windows and trying to break
into shops, witnesses said.
   The violence began shortly after midnight and when order was
restored before dawn the main Nathan Road throughfare was littered
with glass and charred rubbish.
   Government-owned Radio Hong Kong said some people in the crowd
wore black arm bands and shouted ``Down with Li Peng!'' the Chinese
premier.
   But Hong Kong Police Commissioner Ray Anning said the rioters
were not part of the main stream of people who have been
demonstrating daily in this British colony in support of Beijing
students demanding more democracy.
   He appealed to people who want to demonstrate their support for
the students to ``disassociate themselves from criminal and unruly
elements.''
   A local group supporting the pro-democracy movement in China
announced after the violence that it was cancelling all rallies and
a procession planned for Wednesday that it had scheduled as part of
a general strike.
   The Hong Kong Alliance was formed after up to 1 million people
joined in a march on May 21 to demonstrate support for the residents
of Beijing.

   A Surinamese jetliner trying to land
in dense fog clipped treetops and broke apart near the airport on
Wednesday, killing 169 of those aboard, the government-run news
agency said. It listed 13 survivors.
   At least three Americans, the cockpit crew, were reported dead in
Suriname's worst air disaster. President Ramsewak Shankar declared a
week of mourning.
   The plane crashed after it hit a treetop on its third attempt to
land in ``extremely bad'' weather, said airline spokesman Leo
Marapin in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Three of Suriname's senior military leaders were aboard and
presumed dead.
   Also reported aboard were at least three top Dutch soccer players
of Surinamese origin. Their fates were unknown.
   The Surinam Airways DC-8 was completing an all-night flight from
Amsterdam to the capital of this small nation on the northern
shoulder of South America. Airline spokesman Glenn Jie in Amsterdam
said most passengers were Surinamese living in the Netherlands.
   Survivors, including three children, were taken to a hospital,
the Suriname News Agency said. No immediate information was
available on their conditions. The agency said one boy was hurled
out of the plane and was rescued when he came running out of the
jungle crying for his mother.
   Airline spokesman Robbi Lachmising told reporters in Amsterdam
the Surinamese airport has no radar.
   He said the plane carried 173 passengers and nine crew and said
168 were killed and 14 survived. The news agency listed only 13
survivors, however.
   Listed as missing and presumed dead were Suriname's army chief of
staff, Maj. Raymond Lieuw Yen Tai; air force commander Maj. Eddy
Djoe, and army chief of operations Capt. Armand Salomons.
   The airline identified the cockpit crew as Americans Capt. Will
Rogers, pilot Glyn Tobias and engineer Rose Warren, all employees of
Surinam Airways. Further information about them was not immediately
known.
   The agency quoted airline director Motilal Atta Mungra as saying
in Paramaribo that all cabin crew members were Surinamers and all
were killed.
   Flight PY764 took off late Tuesday from Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport and crashed at 4:30 a.m. about two miles from Zanderij
International Airport, about 15 miles south of the capital, the
agency said.
   In Washington, board spokesman Michael Benson said that at the
request of Suriname's government, the National Transportation Safety
Board sent a team of five investigators to assist in the crash
investigation.
   Mungra said the U.S. team would assist a government investigation
commission headed by Attorney General Rene Reeder.
   Reporters at the crash site, an unpopulated tropical savannah,
said it appeared the plane struck two trees and split into four
parts. Heavy rain had turned the area into a near-swamp, slowing
rescue vehicles.
   The Suriname News Agency said the plane's cockpit recorder was
recovered.
   Wreckage and bodies were scattered over a wide area.
   Hours after the crash, firefighters still sprayed foam on the
smoldering and broken fuselage. Soldiers searched for bodies,
belongings and documents.
   The 20-year-old plane was registered in the United States,
Lachmising said.
   Suriname radio reports quoted residents as saying they heard an
explosion shortly before the plane hit the ground. Lachmising said
the plane did not explode or catch fire after breaking up.
   He said the jetliner, leased by Surinam Airways from an
unidentified U.S. company, was extensively overhauled in Luxembourg
about 10 days ago.
   Spokesman Nico Snijders of Inter Football, a Dutch organization
for professional soccer players, identified three Dutch soccer
players of Surinamese origin who he said were aboard _ Orwin Linger,
Lloyd Doesburg and Fred Patrick. They were bound for a national
tournament in Suriname, a former Dutch colony.
   At Surinam Airways' downtown office in Amsterdam, dozens of
weeping relatives gathered to await news.
   Mungra was quoted as saying his company all but ruled out a
technical malfunction because the DC-8 underwent a regular
3,000-mile maintenance checkup two weeks ago. He suspended all
flights of the line's remaining aircraft.
   Suriname, a nation of about 300,000, gained independence from the
Netherlands in 1975. About 200,000 Surinamese live in the
Netherlands.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of Recruit Co., the central
figure in the bribery scandal that has rocked Japanese politics, was
released Tuesday on bail of $1.4 million, officials said.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, 52, spent 113 days in custody after his arrest in
February on charges of bribing former Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. executives Ei Shikiba and Hisahiko Hasegawa.
   Ezoe was the last person to be released from among the 12 people
indicted and arrested in the scandal. Bail for the others ranged
from the equivalent of $35,200 to $209,800, said Akira Saito, Tokyo
District Court spokesman.
   Ezoe also was charged later with offering cut-rate stock shares
to Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp., ex-Vice Education Minister Kunio Takaishi, former Chief
Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami, former Parliament member Kasuya
Ikeda and ex-Vice Labor Minister Takashi Kato.
   Recipients of the stock shares were charged with receiving bribes
and have been freed on bail.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, the new secretary general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, told a news conference Tuesday his
political support group had received but did not report about $1.1
million in donations in April 1985, including $2,820 from Recruit
Co., an information and publishing conglomerate.
   Hashimoto said Friday he had received $14,000 in donations in
1986 from Recruit.
   He said Tuesday he had not intended to conceal the 1985 donations
and apologized for not having properly supervised his secretaries
who he said had handled the transactions.
   Hashimoto was appointed to the party post as part of the
administration of new Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
   Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and his Cabinet resigned
Friday in an attempt to clear the stains of the bribery scandal from
the Liberal Democrats.
   The scandal surfaced last summer when the newspaper Asahi Shimbun
reported that the deputy mayor of a city near Tokyo had received
bargain-priced stocks from Recruit in exchange for favors to the
company.
   In the following months investigations showed that Recruit
provided cut-rate stock to about 160 politicians, bureaucrats and
businessmen and gave large donations to some politicians and their
organizations in an alleged attempt to buy influence.

<HEAD>`The Lisbon Traviata' by Terrence McNally Revived Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrence McNally's ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' which
opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club, is more
than a play about obsession. It is two very different plays about
obsession.
   The first act is a blithe, bitchy look at one fan's extreme
fascination with opera; the second, a melodramatic and deadly
examination of a gay love affair gone wrong. The two don't tie
together neatly, but they make for some compelling, often
entertaining and even unnerving theater.
   McNally, author of ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
excels at the knowing put-down, the slightly sour but funny
observation. In the past, he has skewered New York theater people in
``It's Only a Play.''
   In ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' he dissects opera buffs, specifically
the homosexual fans who idolized certain female stars. These are the
men who call singers only by their first names, who have
encyclopedic knowledge of opera trivia and who buy every recording
made by their heroines.
   Mendy (Nathan Lane) is one such true believer, a worshipper of
Maria Callas. He learns his good friend Stephen (Anthony Heald) has
purchased a pirated recording of Callas' 1958 performance of ``La
Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Much of Act 1 deals with Mendy's attempts to obtain a copy of the
record. In between the pleading and cajoling, the two men dish and
then demolish just about every diva around from Marilyn Horne to
Beverly Sills to Joan Sutherland. Their comments are mean, unfair
and funny.
   Yet there is a sadness, almost a desperation, underlying the
revelry.
   ``Opera doesn't reject me,'' Mendy sighs. ``The real world does.''
   Wearing a too-tight bathrobe, Lane flounces around an overdone
Manhattan apartment, designed by Philipp Jung to look like the
outside of a box of Valentine candy. Lane's is a joke-filled role
guaranteed to win audience sympathy, but the actor never succumbs to
buffonery or soap opera histrionics. He finds both the humor and the
humiliation in the character.
   Stephen is more enigmatic and not very likable, a trait that
doesn't really become apparent until the second act. By then, the
locale has switched to Stephen's apartment, a stark, sparse living
space filled with expensive stereo equipment and scores of neatly
shelved records and CDs.
   And the comedy has disappeared in favor of melodrama involving
Stephen, his lover Michael and Michael's new boyfriend. The plot
takes on aspects of grand opera as Stephen forces the play to a
tragic conclusion.
   The playwright has improved the play since its last incarnation
at a small off-off-Broadway theater four years ago. McNally has
enriched the second act, giving Michael a strong speech explaining
why he is leaving Stephen.
   Heald turns in a riveting performance as Stephen, whose fondness
for opera colors his real-life relationships. Dan Butler is fine as
the disgruntled lover. He forcefully articulates what is wrong when
someone only focuses on what he likes.

   Construction unions and businesses have agreed
to a plan that would keep heavy trucks from making deliveries during
peak commuting hours to help reduce air pollution, Mayor Tom Bradley
announced Tuesday.
   Southern California's skies are among the nation's most polluted
because of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with
stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area.
   The city agreed to exempt from its proposed traffic management
program trucks and equipment necessary for pouring concrete, laying
hot asphalt and erecting structural steel, Bradley said.
   In return, the construction industry ``agreed to shift its work
hours _ without premium pay _ to 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of the
current 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. to reduce truck and automobile traffic,''
Bradley said.
   The one-hour shift would remove about 125,000 construction
workers from city streets during morning and afternoon rush-hour
traffic, the mayor said.
   The proposal, developed by the city jointly with a regional air
quality control agency, would require truck operators to pay a
surcharge for a license allowing them to use city streets during
rush hour. It also would create a rapid deployment task force
intended to quickly respond and clean up major accidents.
   The altered work schedule would involve members of 83 union
locals, including boiler makers, brick layers, carpenters, operating
engineers, teamsters, general contractors, pipe trade workers and
painters.
   The plan is expected to go before the City Council early next
month.

   The U.S. ambassador to China has asked that all
American dependents and non-essential diplomatic personnel be
ordered out of China, according to a State Department spokesman.
   ``The embassy in Beijing recommended the evacuation of dependents
and non-essential diplomatic personnel to the Secretary of State,''
said Evans Gerakas, a spokesman for the task force on China.
   The spokesman indicated such an order from the secretary would
probably apply to all U.S. diplomats in China but ``That decision
won't come until later today,'' he said.
   Gerakas said the suggestion had come from the embassy early this
morning following reports that Chinese soldiers had surrounded an
apartment complex housing U.S. diplomats and prevented them from
leaving the area for some time.

   A top U.S. health official says the time is
coming when doctors will report the names of people testing positive
for the AIDS virus and try to trace victims' sexual contacts. But
activists criticized the proposal.
   Dr. James Mason, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health, said he
didn't know when such a system would be in place, but when it
happens ``we will have normalized HIV and will handle it like
syphilis.''
   HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.
   Mason's remarks Tuesday at the Fifth International Conference on
AIDS drew immediate criticism.
   Richard Dunne, executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis

suffer from the stigma associated with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``People lose their jobs, their housing and their schooling
opportunities,'' he said. ``That's not like other diseases.''

   Between 12 and 22 percent of America's children
_ as many as 14 million of those under age 18 _ are suffering from
some type of mental disorder, but only about a third are receiving
any treatment, a study released today reported.
   A committee of the Institute of Medicine said in the study that
though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the
situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is
``demonstrable progress'' toward understanding, preventing and
correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters.
   ``There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major
childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment,'' the
committee said.
   But in far too many cases, no treatment at all is being offered
to troubled youngsters, the committee said.

   With President Bush vowing that the ``scourge''
of drugs will stop and drug czar William J. Bennett organizing the
troops for a full-scale war, calls for decriminalization of drug use
are like cries in the dark.
   But the cries are getting louder and have drawn together people
from disparate sides of the political spectrum _ from conservative
William F. Buckley to Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, a former
prosecutor.
   Advocates of such a stance point to a drop in crime rates
following the 1933 end of Prohibition that had outlawed liquor sales
since 1920. Today, huge drug profits and artificially high drug
prices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout the
country, they say.
   Removing the profits would remove the criminals, the argument
goes, and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessful
enforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and education
programs.

wives have been arrested for civil disobedience and the union has

<HEAD>What Is the Fed Fighting?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Why use a cudgel when a scalpel is called for?
   In one form or another that question forever arises in
discussions of Federal Reserve or monetary policy, which involves
decisions about the supply and cost of money in the economy.
   Most likely it will continue to arise for years to come, the
simple truth being that monetary officials are familiar with the
cudgel, a blunt instrument, but haven't yet acquired skill with the
more refined scalpel.
   As a consequence, critics say, the Fed's inevitable first
reaction to signs of inflation is to slow the economy, mainly by
restricting the money supply and thereby raising interest rates.
   It works. Just as a human being would falter under repeated blows
to the head, the economy eventually slows. Factories close,
unemployment rises and demand lessens. No mystery there; people just
don't have the money to buy.
   But the question remains: Why should the Fed have to slow the
whole economy rather than simply restraining the inflationary
culprits? Because the instruments and skills don't seem to be
available to it.
   John Wright, an international investment adviser and frequent
critic of Fed policy, claims that for years monetary policy failed
to perceive the true causes of domestic inflation and needlessly
bludgeoned the American economy.
   He becomes particularly incensed at repeated Federal Reserve
efforts to dampen the American economy because of a factor that
should have been dealt with abroad. The inflationary factor was
Eurodollars, created by European banks.
   In his view, these dollars, created whenever dollar-denominated
loans were made by foreign banks, created a classic inflation
scenario, that of too many dollars chasing too few goods.
   Prices rose, but not because of domestic demand but because
foreign banks created dollars without any supervision or restraints
by American authorities.
   Still, he says, the Fed response to Eurodollar inflation was to
cudgel the American economy into repeated recessions.
   A somewhat similar worry arises today. Inflation for the 12
months ended in April was 5.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in the
year before, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The suggestion
is that of general inflation.
   However, over the same time the consumer price index inflation
rate for all items, less food and energy, barely rose. For the 12
months ended in April 1988 it was 4.3 percent. For the 12 months
through April 1989 it was 4.6 percent.
   Exclude food and energy prices and the inflation rate is almost
stable. Add them and you have a dangerous trend. Now, however, there
are some indications that food and energy prices may have
stabilized, albeit at high levels.
   Last year's drought largely was responsible for driving up food
prices by 6.5 percent. While there is no assurance the drought will
not continue or resume, those knowledgeable about weather conditions
are optimistic.
   Last year energy prices rose 8.7 percent, largely on the basis of
reduced production by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. This year there are some indications supplies
will be larger than before.
   Fed watchers therefore are expressing optimism that Fed policy
won't grow harsher, and even that the Fed will ease up on the
economy, allowing interest rates to fall.
   In short, the belief is that the Fed will try to use the scalpel
instead of the familiar cudgel.

<TEXT>
   Often derided as ``a nice place to live, but you
wouldn't want to visit,'' Atlanta tries one more time next month to
amuse conventioneers and capture its soul as Underground Atlanta
opens for business _ again.
   Seven years after the lights went out, ostensibly for good, the
entertainment and shopping playground beneath downtown is set to
open Thursday after a three-year overhaul under the auspices of The
Rouse Co., the wizards of American urban reclamation.
   In its prime, Underground Atlanta was Atlanta's answer to the
French Quarter, created in old storefronts that were the city's
heart before a network of bridges over railroad tracks literally
raised downtown one level.
   Underground had swinging Dixieland, loud rock 'n' roll, cool
jazz, fine eateries, chic watering holes _ even a shop where
segregationist restaurateur-turned-governor Lester Maddox signed
autographs and sold souvenirs.
   Underground opened in 1969, peaked in 1972, was struggling by
1975, and was gone by 1982. It was eulogized as the victim of crime
_ or a perception thereof _ derelicts, subway construction, ripoff
merchants and changing times. There were dozens of theories about
what went wrong, but seemingly no answers.
   Without it, downtown Atlanta has acquired the reputation of a
ghost town after dark, which has been an albatross around the neck
of the city's thriving convention industry. While conventioneers sit
in gleaming downtown hotels, real Atlantans are miles away in the
biracial city's largely white suburbs.
   In 1985, the city signed the deal for a $142 million
rerevitalization. It turned to Rouse, the people responsible for
Boston's Faneuil Hall Market Place, Baltimore's Harborplace, New
York's South Street Seaport, among other projects.
   ``We're trying to create a town center for metropolitan Atlanta,
back to the birthplace of Atlanta,'' said Joseph G. Martin Jr.,
president of the Underground Atlanta development company. ``We want
it to be a place ... where visitors will come to find out about what
Atlanta has to offer, but where also the hometown crowd can feel
some sense of identity.''
   Mayor Andrew Young sees the new Underground as ``one of the most
significant accomplishments'' of two terms in office. ``This
represents a new heart for Atlanta. It represents a gathering place
for the entire metro area.''
   The new Underground is on and around the original site, on
downtown's south side, just blocks from the high-rise hotel
district. It's three times the size of the old Underground; visitors
will find 22 restaurants and nightclubs and nearly 100 retailers.
While the emphasis on retailing marks a change for Underground, the
entertainment focus is something new for Rouse.
   ``We've never done this strong an entertainment aspect to any of
our urban places,'' said William M. Coleman, vice president and
general manager of Rouse-Atlanta, the Rouse affiliate created to run
the project.
   ``Some of that is due to the name,'' he said. ``Underground
Atlanta has probably the highest name recognition of any project
we've ever touched ... and what Underground Atlanta was known for
was entertainment.''
   Rouse officials anticipate 10 million to 11 million visitors a
year, half of them out-of-towners. They say there are enough office
workers and convention-goers downtown to meet three-fourths of
Underground's needs.
   Even so, Martin said, ``The real test of whether the project
succeeds ... is whether the project appeals to residents. The
obvious concern _ what a lot of people talk about around here _ is
security.''
   That's because the old Underground came to be regarded as
dangerous.
   Dante Stephensen, whose Dante's Down The Hatch jazz club and
restaurant anchored the old Underground, said, ``At its worst,
Underground had a lower crime rate than Lenox Square (a popular
mall). But downtown areas can't protect themselves from bad
publicity.''
   Clearly, this time around Underground must be perceived as safe.
   ``We've taken a common-sense approach,'' Martin said. A squad of
some 30 private guards will patrol, accompanied by Atlanta police,
who are building a 34-officer substation there. Planners have made
sure there are no blind alleys, and lighting designers have made it
bright enough to read at midnight.
   Martin admits to being irked that he is repeatedly asked what
Underground will do to keep out ``undesirables.'' ``First, tell me
who the `undesirables' are. This is a town center. It's open to
everyone. If a person comes to Underground and happens to look
different, that's fine. If a person starts to infringe on somebody
else's rights, that's not fine.''
   A no-nonsense security policy seems to have wide public appeal.
Where city officials triggered a storm of criticism with a plan to
run vagrants out before last year's Democratic National Convention,
hardly anything has been heard from anyone concerned about
loiterers' civil rights in Underground.
   ``I don't see it as a problem,'' Coleman said. ``The biggest
problem is in perception, and that perception problem goes away as
people come here and have a good time and find out they aren't
hassled.''
   ``I would be surprised,'' Martin said, ``if Underground is not
the safest place in the whole Atlanta area.''
   It had better be. The city has sunk more than $80 million in
revenue bonds, as well as other public funding, into Underground. If
it flops, the city could be forced to cough up some $3 million a
year for 30 years.
   ``Underground is important symbolically, and it is a test of
whether a town center can work here, whether we have enough
cohesiveness,'' Martin said. ``Because if we continue to drift
apart, as we've been doing, there could be all sorts of consequences
_ economic, political, social and otherwise.''
   And although Rouse has relatively little capital invested, the
company's track record is on the line. ``It seems that each year,
the expectations get higher, as they see what's happened in other
cities,'' Coleman said.
   ``Rouse has taken slums and turned them into landmarks,'' said
Stephenson, who is reopening Dante's. ``And Underground Atlanta was
never as bad, at its worst, as any of those other areas were.''
   Project officials maintain there's virtually no way Underground
will fail.
   ``I'm convinced Underground is going to be a great success,''
Martin said, pointing out that while two developers put together the
first Underground on a shoestring, this time the city is landlord,
partner and major investor.
   ``The city leaders recognize how important it is, and they're not
going to let it fail,'' he said. ``They just can't.''

<HEAD>Turnout At Politics-Weary Baptist Convention Expected to Be Low</HEAD>

   Many Southern Baptists are expected to
shun this year's denominational convention in Las Vegas, Nev.,
because of the city's distance from Baptist enclaves and the
reputation of the gamblers' paradise.
   Some may also do so because they're tired of the prolonged
partisan strife in the 14.8 million-member denomination, the
country's largest Protestant body.
   Although its annual conventions in recent years have attracted
large crowds, hitting a high mark of 45,000 in 1985, only 13,000 to
15,000 are expected June 13-15 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
   Lee Porter, registration secretary, estimated the reduced
attendance based on responses from congregations. Each may send a
maximum number of delegates, called ``messengers,'' based on
membership and financial contributions.
   For the last 10 years, huge turnouts have been spurred by the
conflict going on between fundamentalist and moderate factions.
Although the struggle continues, fatigue with it has become evident.
   Porter said there are a lot of other reasons for lessened
attendance, the first being the ``extreme distance'' to Las Vegas
from the area of Southern Baptist concentration, mostly in the South.
   ``The second reason our crowd is going to be down is that some of
our churches and some of our leaders have a problem going to Las
Vegas because of the reputation of the city,'' he said.
   Attendance typically is a family affair and many Baptists don't
want to bring their children to Las Vegas and expose them to the
city's seamier side.
   While a previous convention approved meeting in Los Vegas this
year, the choice had passed only by a narrow margin.
   Perhaps an underlying factor in the expected lower attendance is
members' boredom with bickering between fundamentalists and
moderates, who for 10 years have tried unsuccessfully to topple
fundamentalist control.
   The key battle has been over the denominational presidency, but
moderates, sometimes called centrists, so far have been unable to
win it for a decade.
   The president appoints key committees which determine the
personnel and policies of Southern Baptist agencies and
institutions. While many Baptists are tired of the struggle, it
shows no signs of abating.
   ``They don't want to go and spend a week arguing,'' Porter said.
``That's not good Christianity or good religion. You just don't
enjoy that.''
   If attendance does drop, as Porter predicts, it might help
moderates elect their candidate, the Rev. Daniel Vestal, pastor of
Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta.
   He is pitted against the Rev. Jerry Vines, the
fundamentalist-backed president. He was elected last year and is
unlikely to be unseated, since no incumbent who has sought a second
term in recent history has been defeated.
   Vestal said he is is doubtful that a low turnout would help him.
``The faction that is now in control has just done an incredible job
in getting the right types of messengers to the convention.''
   Vestal describes himself as a political novice and said he simply
represents a broad middle ground of philosophy. He added:
   ``There is not going to be unity until there is a kind of
inclusion of all people in the process. The philosophy of the last
10 years basically says it's winner take all. There can be no unity
in that type of attitude.
   ``A winner shares with all is my philosophy. I would include
those in the present leadership and those who are not in the
leadership. This is not between two individuals, but it is between
two philosophies.''
   Despite the conflict, Porter said most rank-and-file Baptists
aren't interested.
   He said the convention generally is ``devoid of issues'' that
attract attendance, adding that ``there is a lack of controversial
issues and that produces a lack of interest.''
   Vines said he questions whether boredom with the controversy has
deterred attendance. He added in a telephone interview from his
First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla.:
   ``My perception is that the projection of lower attendance is
more due to distance and economic considerations.''
   Perhaps the strongest religious draw to the meeting will be a
planned proselytism sweep of Las Vegas by about 2,000 Baptists
trying to recruit residents to attend church, Porter said. They hope
to visit 30,000 to 35,000 homes on the Saturday before the
convention begins.
   ``They are not going into the casinos. They are going into the
homes where people live and try to give witness,'' Porter said.
   No matter the turnout, Vestal said the centrist movement is not
likely to stall in Las Vegas.
   Porter said the centrists probably would have a better chance at
the convention next year in New Orleans since it is closer to their
areas of strength such as in Virginia and North Carolina. He added:
   ``Who wins the election depends on who comes and who is in the
hall when the vote is taken.''

   As a symbolic gesture in reverse of Martin
Luther's nailing to a church door his 16th century challenge to
Roman Catholicism, a new covenant between Catholics and Lutherans
here was posted on a church door.
   Signed and celebrated at a joint service, the covenant between
local Roman Catholic leaders and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America affirms that they share much in faith and pledges work for
full unity.
   To remove remaining barriers, Chicago Lutheran Bishop Sherman G.
Hicks advised: ``Let us listen to each other in dialogue and
admonish one another in a spirit of love and gentleness.''
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, Chicago's Catholic archbishop, said:
``We celebrate our covenant as servants and partners, not denying
our differences ... but not being immobilized by them either. Our
common baptism serves as the foundation for more complete unity.''

<HEAD>Drunk Busters: Tipsters Keep An Eye On Louisville Highways</HEAD>

   George House has been obsessed with
getting drunks off the road since his son saw 27 people die when
their church bus was hit last year by a truck driven by a man now
charged with drunken driving and murder.
   Eighteen-year-old Chris House ``was riding a bus behind the one
that was hit near Carrollton. When he got home, he was still shaken
by what he had seen and heard. Some of the kids that died were close
to his age.''
   George House, a Transit Authority of River City bus driver for 11
years, ``sat down and wrote my company, suggesting that any of our
drivers who spotted a drunk behind the wheel should alert the
dispatcher to call police.''
   The Transit Authority took House's idea to police, who got $1,900
to pay for ``Drunk Buster on Board'' stickers for participating
vehicles.
   The idea caught on, and and there now are approximately 5,000
volunteers like House in the Louisville area, all equipped with
two-way radios. They are the anonymous tipsters who have made
``Drunk Busters'' a success in Jefferson County and drawn the
attention of law enforcers from Florida to Wyoming.
   ``We now have 25 firms involved and more should come on board
later. There's such a diversity of spotters that the offender won't
know whether the information leading to his arrest came from a guy
behind the wheel of a cememt mixer or one driving a floral van,''
said police spokesman Bob Yates.
   Police have gotten more than 100 calls since Drunk Busters began
in December _ seven months after the Carrollton accident _ and while
it would be difficult to track each tip in the courts, Yates said
drunken driving arrests are up 19.1 percent.There were 977 DUI
arrests in the first quarter compared to 820 in the 1988 quarter.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that Drunk Busters has been
responsible for the increase. We're happy with the way things are
going,'' he said.
   House, too, is happy about Drunk Busters' success. ``It's made
the long arm of the law much longer.''
   Police have gotten requests for information from around the
country. One inquiry came from Paul Feiner, a member of the
Westchester County, N.Y., board of legislators who planned to
recommend adopting the plan. ``I would consider the program a
success if it gets just one deadly driver off the highway. I think
it makes sense to get people to work with the police.''
   David Shedd, president of a beer distributor, was critical of
Drunk Busters when it was unveiled just before the Christmas
holidays.
   ``Our industry was under attack about that time and I thought
this was another shot being fired at us,'' Shedd said. ``I had
volunteered the services of my employees to help put out a packet
covering drinking and driving.''
   The packets went to motels, hotels and restaurants, and offered
hints on how bartenders could recognize customers who had too much.
Shedd understands the intent of Drunk Busters ``but the application
bothered me.''
   House, 39, a former county corrections officer, has turned in
three suspected drunken drivers recently. ``One of them had a can of
beer between his legs and a case on the seat beside him.''
   He and other men like Roger Coffey, the owner of a 23-wrecker
towing fleet, have learned to spot signs a motorist may be under the
influence.
   ``They always slow down when they've had too much liquor. If the
driver is going 25 mph in a 55 mph zone and he isn't elderly or
half-blind, watch out,'' Coffey said. ``You also have to take a
second look at the guy whose vehicle is weaving in the roadway,
straddling the middle line or accelearating and decelarating
rapidly.''
   He said his employees have faithfully followed those guidelines
and so far have made ``25 to 30 calls under Drunk Busters.''
   Because of the nature of his business, Coffey had doubts about
joining the program. ``We're the only towing service in it, but
we've never towed a drunk that we turned in,'' he said.
   Confidentiality helps Drunk Busters work, he said. ``It doesn't
set up a confrontation between my people and the motorist.
   ``Our driver simply alerts the dispatcher and he passes along the
license number and other information to the police.''
   Coffey said his company responds to 18,000 calls a year. ``We see
a lot of carnage. When a drunk is involved, it makes you angrier
than usual.''

   Matt Frewer, as Dr. Mike Stratford on CBS'
``Doctor, Doctor,'' marches to the beat of a different EKG.
   He makes house calls and treats his patients as individuals. His
surgeon father is appalled, and his physician partners are dismayed.
His father prefers his patients under anesthesia, and his partners
regard them as payments on the Porsche.
   The six-episode series makes its debut Monday, and the diagnosis
is hilarious. The funny, quirky, sometimes caustic show was created
by Norman Steinberg, co-writer of the hit movie comedy ``My Favorite
Year.''
   ``We wanted to do something different than your usual
single-parent sitcom format,'' said Frewer, best-known for his role
as video star ``Max Headroom.'' ``This says some important things
about the practice of medicine and says them in a very funny way.
Norman wrote the show and the usual practice in television is,
`Don't mutilate my baby.' Norman let the reins go and said, `Anytime
you want to ad lib, go ahead.' We had a great relationship.''
   Stratford, says Frewer, ``is basically a nice guy with a wry
sense of humor. He means well but he sometimes tries too hard. His
personal life falls by the wayside because of his work.''
   Stratford is also a novelist and is the medical expert for a
local television talk show, ``Wake Up, Providence.'' ``Doctor,
Doctor'' is set in Providence, R.I.
   The show also stars Julius Carry III as Abraham Butterfield,
Stratford's best friend and one of the partners in the clinic,
Maureen Mueller as another partner and a former girlfriend, and Beau
Gravitte as Dr. Grant Linowitz, the upwardly mobile cardiologist.
   Prior to ``Doctor, Doctor,'' Frewer played a double role on ``Max
Headroom,'' as TV reporter Edison Carter and his computer-generated
image Max Headroom, who became the quintessential star of the video
age. The show, which was created in England, ran on Home Box Office
and on ABC two seasons ago. ``Max Headroom'' was also the star of a
series of Coca-Cola commercials.
   ```Max Headroom' was fun to do, except for the make-up,'' said
Frewer. ``They wanted everyone to think it really was
computer-generated, but it wasn't. Essentially, it was me in makeup.
It took 2{ hours to put it on an 1{ hours to take it off. The only
effect was to take out a frame about every 12 frames to give it a
jerky look.
   ``We perpetuated the myth that he was a computer-generated
character. Max kept getting the cover of magazines. I was jealous of
my alter ego.''
   After ``Max Headroom,'' Frewer co-starred with Rick Moranis in a
Disney movie called ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' which will be
released this month. He also starred in the opening episode this
season of NBC's ``Miami Vice,'' an episode of NBC's ``St.
Elsewhere.'' He co-starred with Drew Barrymore in the movie ``Far
From Home'' and was in ``Speed Zone,'' the third in the
``Cannonball'' movie series.
   The Disney movie, made in Mexico, stars Moranis as a man who
invents a machine that shrinks people and objects. ``Rick and I are
both from Canada and we spent the whole time singing Bachman Turner
Overdrive songs,'' he said. ``That music was Canada's claim to fame
in rock 'n' roll.''
   Frewer was actually born in Washington, where his father, a
Canadian Navy officer, was assigned to the Canadian Embassy. He grew
up in Victoria, British Columbia.
   ``I did some school plays, but what I really wanted to do was
play hockey,'' he said. ``But when I was 15, I was severely injured
while playing. I was on crutches for nine months. I play now with a
celebrity hockey team. We play retired National Hockey League
players. I have all their bubble gum cards. It's a non-checking,
non-slapshot league _ `Don't hit me, I'm filming on Tuesday.'''

<HEAD>Political Exits Seldom Graceful</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Graceful exits are rare among players who reach
the national political stage and have to leave before they're ready.
Politicians tend to hang on past the applause, especially when they
get into trouble.
   They linger, seeking vindication from colleagues or one more term
from the voters _ sometimes both.
   Rep. Tony Coehlo of California, the Democratic whip, is an
exception. Former Speaker of the House Jim Wright took the more
traveled course.
   Wright resigned as speaker on Tuesday. He left with no apologies,
in the manner of President Richard M. Nixon 15 years ago.
   Wright said he'd made mistakes _ ``Oh boy, how many?'' _ but he
did not seem to count among them the ethics charges that brought him
down.
   Like other politicians who have been forced from power, Wright
said he could have won, but resigned to avoid a long and damaging
battle on the House floor. But by the time he announced he would
quit, on May 31, it was evident that he was going to lose.
   ``All things considered, it became obvious that short of an
all-out harsh and bitter fight on the House floor, it would be
unrealistic to expect a complete exoneration, which is the only
thing I was interested in,'' Wright said.
   Coehlo is resigning one week from today, his 47th birthday,
rather than face an ethics investigation of his own. But for that
cloud and the startling way he chose to dispel it, he would have
become majority leader and, in all probability, a future speaker.
   Coehlo's problem stemmed from a junk bond investment, made with
borrowed money and aided by a California savings and loan executive.
It gained him all of $6,882.
   He said he regretted the deal, but that it was now fully
disclosed and that he had violated no rules. Coehlo said he could
have proved all that, but at a greater cost to him, his party and
his causes than he was willing to pay.
   ``Some say this is not the type of mistake to do what you are
doing,'' he said in Modesto, Calif., after announcing his
resignation. ``I made a mistake. I'm willing to live with it and
it's time to move on.''
   He hasn't said what he is going to do next. His resignation ends
any prospect of a House inquiry into the 1986 junk bond deal,
although the government still could investigate his conduct.
   That could work to his ultimate advantage if his conduct is
cleared. His quick, clean break left political bridges intact,
preserving the chance of a return to Democratic influence and,
perhaps, public office.
   Few do.
   Until now, Republicans held the franchise for the most striking
political departures of the era, the two-one resignations of Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew and President Nixon.
   Agnew quit under criminal charges on Oct. 10, 1973. He pleaded no
contest to income tax evasion and resigned as part of a plea bargain
in which other charges were dropped and the government asked for
leniency, not prison.
   Even so, he left with a familiar claim, saying he was sparing the
country a distraction that could have dragged on for two or three
years.
   ``As you are aware, the accusations against me cannot be resolved
without a long, divisive and debilitating struggle in the Congress
and in the courts,'' Agnew wrote Nixon.
   Barely 10 months later, Nixon faced three impeachment charges
before becoming the first president to resign. He had been forced by
the Supreme Court to release a tape transcript that proved his
involvement in the Watergate cover-up, despite two years of denials.
   So, he faced the television cameras and uttered ``the most
difficult sentence I shall ever have to speak'' _ his resignation.
   In congressional ethics cases, the member in the dock often
leaves with a warning to colleagues that they might be next. Wright
didn't make that explicit, although he called his fate ``mindless
cannibalism'' and then said nobody should try to get even.
   When Sen. Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut was censured by the
Senate in 1967 for using political money to pay personal bills _ a
practice since legalized in some cases _ he called it a grave
mistake and injustice, and said such things could happen to others.
He lost the next election, running as an independent because the
Democrats didn't want him. His son, Christopher, is a Connecticut
senator now.
   That was also the year the House refused to seat Rep. Adam
Clayton Powell Jr. of New York on grounds he had misused $40,000 in
congressional funds. He ran again, won again and got his seat back
in 1969, even before the Supreme Court overruled his exclusion.
   Outright expulsions from Congress are rare. A member facing that
ultimate sanction usually resigns when the outcome becomes
inevitable.
   One who did not was Rep. Michael Myers of Philadelphia, kicked
out in 1980 for accepting a bribe in the FBI's Abscam operation.
   One who did was Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. of New Jersey in
1982.
   Williams, convicted of bribery and conspiracy in Abscam, quit
after five days of Senate debate that made clear he couldn't win.
   He said he'd been the victim of an FBI setup that had put every
senator at risk _ ``it is all of us, the entire Senate.''
   It wasn't. Senate or House, then or now.

<HEAD>An Opportunity To Prepay Your Mortgage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As interest rates drop, smart homeowners with
variable rate mortgages are preparing for a great leap forward by
voluntarily raising their monthly payments.
   Such homeowners, and there are lots of them, exploit the cyclical
nature of interest rates by accelerating their payments when rates
are down and slowing them when rates rise, thus obtaining the
greatest return for their dollar.
   Not everyone has the cash flow to do so, of course, but even
small amounts can make a big difference when repeated for many
months.
   Assuming a five-year cycle of high and low rates, some of these
homeowners add to their payments for the 30 months or so when rates
are lowest and then add nothing to their payments during the high
end of the cycle.
   In such ways they can pare years from the maturity date of their
loans.
   The theory is similar to what is practiced regularly in the stock
market where wise investors buy when stock prices are low and avoid
further commitments when prices are high, thus getting the most
shares for the dollar.
   In real estate, homeowners in effect obtain more equity for the
dollar by adding to their payments when their variable mortgage
rates fall. In effect, such prepayments:
   _``Buy'' more equity for the buck.
   _Accelerate the equity-loan ratio, or the amount of the monthly
payment that goes to equity versus loan repayment.
   Most of the payment in the first few months of a mortgage loan is
to repay interest. As each month passes, more money is applied to
equity and less to interest until, near maturity, the payments are
almost all equity.
   By making additional payments, that process is hastened. Not only
does the additional payment, in itself, lower the loan amount and
add to the equity, but it ``jumps'' the homeowner into the more
favorable equity-loan relationship.
   _Shrink the mortgage maturity date _ perhaps, for example, from
20 years to 18 _ saving thousands of dollars of interest payments.
   All three of these benefits are simply different ways of saying
the same thing, that when you speed up repayments, especially when
rates are at the low point in the cycle, you can save substantial
sums.
   Unless drastic changes occur in the way the American economy
operates, such opportunities will present themselves at least two or
three times in a 20-year period. Economies are cyclical, forever
expanding or contracting.
   During the old days of fixed-rate mortgages, homeowners didn't
have the opportunity to take advantage of these cycles. No matter
what happened to rates in general, borrowers were locked into their
initial contract rates.
   Variable rates were developed primarily because lenders wanted
them for their own protection. Why, they reasoned, should they be
locked into low rates for long terms when their own costs of
obtaining money might rise?
   Lenders thus obtained the protection they sought, but in so doing
they also left an opening for savvy homeowners.
   There is nothing in most mortgage contracts written today to
prevent borrowers from taking advantage of the low end of the
interest-rate cycle.
   Even for bankers, it seems, security comes at a price.

<TEXT>
   Both say that they want to cool it, to stop the battling. Both
take a fundamentalist view of the Bible. Both affirm friendship. But
they're poised for a fight over the nature of Southern Baptists.
   Both claim to represent the genuine Baptist way, the authentic
heritage. But the two candidates for the denomination's presidency
disagree strongly about principles essential to that heritage.
   It's a conflict that has gone on for a decade in the nation's
biggest Protestant denomination, numbering l4.8 million. Its
presidency holds sway over makeup of its operating personnel.
   Filling that powerful top post is the key decision for the
denomination's convention June 13-15 in Las Vegas determining
whether fundamentalists will keep the office for an 11th straight
year.
   Their incumbent candidate, the Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville,
Fla., seeks a second term, calling for peace in the ranks.
   ``I have made a conscious effort to create an atmosphere where
healing and reconciliation could occur,'' he says.
   His challenger, the Rev. Daniel Vestal of suburban Atlanta,
backed by moderates, also calls himself a peacemaker, a
``responsible reconciler, a bridge to call our people back
together.''
   While both speak of ``peace,'' however, both also declare their
adherence to differing positions on principles considered basic for
Baptists, involving the latitude of condoned doctrinal freedom.
   On that, Vines sets certain limits on what is acceptable,
primarily about the Bible but impinging on many other issues, while
Vestal insists on greater room for acceptable differences.
   ``We have certain parameters which are overwhelmingly accepted in
Southern Baptist life,'' Vines says, adding that he has confined his
appointments to those whose beliefs are within those approved
``parameters.''
   Vestal says this has clamped on ``a kind of tight control''
demanding allegiance to it. ``Our freedom is being threatened,'' he
says. ``It has to stop...or we are going to destroy this
denomination.''
   Vines, 51, a native Georgian, has been pastor of First Baptist
Church of Jacksonville, Fla., for the last seven years. Vestal, 44,
a Texan, led the First Baptist Church of Midland, Texas, for 12
years, before becoming pastor of suburban Dunwoody, Ga., Baptist
Church last fall.
   Weighing against Vestal's bid is a longtime convention custom,
unvarying in modern history, of always giving the incumbent a second
term. Vines also is riding a fundamentalist tide.
   Its appointive authority, surpassing that of any post in U.S.
Christianity, determines trustees that control the denomination's 26
agencies and institutions with budgets totalling about $400 million
annually.
   ``In my second year,'' Vines told Baptist Press, ``I would
emphasize building soul-winning churches, and I would like to lead
our convention to a renewed emphasis on church growth.
   ``We have settled the debate over the nature of Scripture. Now it
is time to move into a new era of growth in our local churches.''
   Vestal says that ``humanly speaking, it is not likely that I will
be elected, although I'm going to try.'' If he does win, he says he
would seek a limitation on presidential powers to ``de-politicize''
that office.
   ``The pattern of the last 10 years has been basically a
philosophy of winner-take all,'' he says. ``My philosophy would be
that the winner shares all.''
   Curiously, both Vines and Vestal espouse ``biblical inerrancy,'''
meaning Scripture is literally without error historically,
religiously or scientifically.
   However, Vines' policy has restricted appointments to persons
inside those ``parameters.'' Linked to the paramenters have been
various social positions such as against divorced personnel,
abortion or ordaining women.
   Vestal says his ``appointments would be from a different
perspective. I would include all Southern Baptists'' on both sides
of the prolonged conflict.
   He says that he himself is an ``inerrantist'' about the Bible,
but also is a ``centrist'' who accepts differing approaches under
the Baptist principle of the right of believers to interpret
Scripture as each understands it.
   Vines, seeking to deflect sharp conflict from the convention, has
asked the executive committee to postpone action on a highly
controversial proposal to establish a separate Washington, D.C.,
religious-liberty arm.
   It would be an alternative to the current agency in which nine
Baptist bodies cooperate, the Baptist Joint Committee on Public
Affairs. Fundamentalists have assailed it as not adhering to their
social agenda.
   Vines says he wants the matter deferred so the convention can
focus on evangelism and be ``as positive and united as possible.''
   Vestal, who has campaigned in church meetings in several states,
says he wants the convention to return to its ``time-honored
principles'' such as local church autonomy and ``priesthood of
believers'' emphasizing their equal rights.
   ``We have forsaken basic principles,'' he says. ``It is a power
or control issue, and Southern Baptists have got to resist it. We
have got to stand up and say enough is enough.''

   Contending there is widespread prejudice against
Moslems in America, a new church educational series urges Christians
to develop an understanding of the Islamic faith and recognize
Moslems as neighbors.
   ``Unfortunately recent events have, if anything, strengthened
negative images of Islam and Moslems in the eyes of the West,'' says
the Rev. Elias Mallon, Catholic author of book in the series
entitled ``Neighbors''
   The series, issued by the National Council of Churches'
Friendship Press, also includes ``God is One: The Way of Islam'' and
``One God, Two Faiths: When Christians and Moslems meet.''
   ``Islam is the fastest growing religion on the North American
continent,'' says the Rev. R. Martston Speight, a United Methodist
and director of the council's Office on Christian-Moslem Relations.
   He says Moslems in the United States and Canada now number more
than 3 million.

<HEAD>Harry Connick Jr. _ A Young Pianist Praying For the Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICIA BIBBY</BYLINE>

   Harry Connick Jr., the young pianist whose music
has been rattling chandeliers at the city's swankier jazz joints,
planned to do just one thing before the biggest gig of his life, a
sold-out show at Lincoln Center.
   ``Pray,'' said the 21-year-old Connick.
   On the day of the concert, he'd sleep the day away, go to the
little Catholic church around the corner and ask for some divine
guidance.
   The day before the May 6 Lincoln Center performance, he's up
before dawn to appear on a morning TV news show. He'll be playing in
Washington that night. He's fighting a case of strep throat and,
since he sings during a good portion of his performances, he's
worried that his voice won't hold for the big show the following
night.
   ``Hopefully, I'll have my chops back,'' Connick says, rubbing his
throat with his huge hands. ``This is awful. It's like I can sing
but I have no control.''
   His Greenwich Village studio apartment is littered with tiny
throat lozenge wrappers, most of them crumpled in a pile on the
mantle of his grand piano, which takes up a good part of the space.
It's a gray day, and the studio is lighted only by the muted sun
streaming in the window. The only glow comes from Connick who beams
when he talks about his favorite topics: music and singing.
   Lately he's been practicing all night and, he says, ``praying is
the only thing that can help me now.''
   It's a tactic that's served him well. Relying on religion, in
part, brought him from a rich bog of musicial influences in his
native New Orleans to the splendor of New York's Alice Tully Hall at
Lincoln Center.
   He arrived in New York at age 18, got a room at the local YMCA
and within a month had a job playing the piano in a church. Then
another church in the Bronx needed a choir director. After that,
gigs at ``little dives here and there'' led to others; the joints
got classier, the pianos better tuned.
   Three years later, he has two albums out with Columbia Records _
the first called ``Harry Connick Jr.'' and the second ``20,'' as in
his age at the time. Earlier this year, he had a successful and
often sold-out run at the famed Algonquin Hotel.
   His repertoire relies heavily on nostalgia: Harold Arlen's ``If I
Only Had a Brain''; Hoagy Carmichael's ``Lazy River''; and Bart
Howard's ``In Other Words'' (also called ``Fly Me to the Moon'').
   Connick finds the whole notion of today's popular music
distressing.
   ``They don't understand,'' said Connick, his trademark slick
ash-blond hair bobbing back and forth, referring to no one in
particular and everyone in general who produces and performs trendy
tunes.
   ``There was just an innocence which is lost in American society
today. Can you imagine how nice it would have been, back in the
'40s? The innocence they had back then _ there is such a joyousness
about the music back then.''
   Still, his passion for the past leaves many puzzled.
   ``People always say, `Harry why do you do all those old songs?' I
would just run out of songs to play,'' Connick said of his first
days as a performer in New York when he'd be pressed to play for
hours on end.
   ``I would hear a song like `Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' by
Harold Arlen and I would say, `That sure is a pretty song. I'm going
to buy all his music.' Then I started reading his music and realized
he wrote `Come Rain or Come Shine,' `That Old Black Magic,' `It's
Only a Paper Moon' and a bunch of other songs that are really great.
   ``Not only lyrically are they wonderful to sing, but the melodies
are so perfect,'' Connick said. ``No one writes like that now.''
   He denies he's on a revival trip, and says his polished image _
big, pouty lips, slicked back short hair and loose-fitting suits _
isn't calculated.
   ``I didn't say, `What can I do to market myself? I got it! I'll
slick my hair back, wear baggy suits and sing songs from the 40s.'
Everything just happened coincidentally.''
   Not completely.
   Growing up near New Orleans' bohemian French Quarter with parents
who loved to indulge their boy's musicial aspirations, helped make
the package of Harry Connick Jr. what it is today.
   He made his first public performance when he was 5 for his
father's inauguration as the city's district attorney. ``I got up
there and I remember hearing that applause and I said, `I gotta have
more of that! Where can I get more of that?'''
   In his quest for a big, happy audience, he began to study a host
of musicial influences _ rhythm and blues, honky-tonk, bebop and
stride. Stride is a devilish piano style that requires one hand to
race across the keyboard at a furious speed while the other one
pounds away at a different tempo.
   He began to incorporate sounds from other artists including
Erroll Garner, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington, Thelonius Monk and Louis
Prima. Under the tutelage of jazz pianist Ellis Marsalis (father of
Wynton and Branford), Connick began to master bebop.
   The Marsalis family played a large role in Connick's young
career. Connick admits one of the reasons he moved to New York was
to be near his friend Wynton Marsalis, the Grammy-winning jazz and
classical trumpeter. Delfeayo Marsalis, Wynton's brother, produced
Connick's first album, which was recorded in one afternoon in
January 1987.
   But on this day, ballads were on Connick's mind. He said he'd
been listening to a piece by Frank Sinatra from the album ``In the
Wee Small Hours'' over and over again. He jumps up and plays it to
explain a nuance of the pain he hears in Sinatra's voice and how he
hopes to one day be able to sing a ballad as well.
   ``He's saying, `I get along without you very well, of course I
do.''' Connick said. ``He's being sarcastic.
   ``Now listen,'' he adds, reciting the lyrics along with the
music: ``Except when soft rains call and the drip of the leaves,
then I recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course
I do.''
   Connick stares off and gets a melancholy look in his eyes.
   ``These days they just don't understand,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jonathan Silverman Stars As Opportunistic Rookie Salesman</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

   When Jonathan Silverman was first offered his
role in the HBO movie ``Traveling Man,'' he loathed the character.
   ``I enjoyed the script but I couldn't see myself in it,'' he
said. ``It called for someone in his late 20s, cocky and a
Southerner. I read it again. I really hated Billy Fox.
   ``But the more I hated him the more I loved him. Then when I
heard John Lithgow was also going to play the older salesman I was
thrilled.''
   Billy Fox is a pushy, opportunistic young hustler ready to steal
his mentor's sales route out from under him in the HBO film,
premiering Sunday.
   Silverman is best known for playing ``nice Jewish boys,'' most
particularly Eugene Jerome in playwright Neil Simon's
autobiographical trilogy, ``Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' ``Biloxi
Blues'' and ``Broadway Bound.'' Silverman played the role on
Broadway, and in the movie version of ``Brighton Beach Memoirs.''
   ``Traveling Man,'' described as a combination of ``Death of a
Salesman'' and ``Tin Men,'' was written five years ago by David
Taylor. The crackerjack movie, with fine performances all around,
had kicked around so long, because it wasn't considered commercial
enough, until it was picked up by Home Box Office.
   Ben Cluett (John Lithgow) is a middle-aged salesman of industrial
foam in the deep South whose spectacular sales record hits a slump.
John Glover is the district sales manager with an evangelical fury
and a heart of stone. Glover induces Cluett to take along rookie
salesman Billy Fox to show him the ropes. What Billy has in mind is
to hang Cluett from the ropes and take over his lucrative route.
   Irvin Kershner (''The Empire Strikes Back,'' ``The Flim-Flam
Man'') directed. The movie was shot in Atlanta and New Orleans. It
also stars Margaret Colin as a caring woman Billy meets during Mardi
Gras.
   ``I've never played a character as shady or with such evil
intentions as Billy Fox,'' Silverman said during a break in shooting
his next movie, ``Sketches,'' also starring C. Thomas Howell and
Jason Bateman. ``He's a very complex character, but he has to come
across as naive and innocent until he sticks it to John Lithgow.
   ``He's thoroughly messed up Ben's life, but when Billy gets into
trouble Ben comes back and rescues him. John Lithgow's my idol. It
was a thrill to work with him, but it was difficult to yell at him
and hit him.''
   Silverman grew up in Beverly Hills and was 17 when he landed the
role in ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' in 1983, replacing Matthew
Broderick.
   ``Working in `Brighton Beach Memoirs' was my first job and my
first time away from home,'' he said. ``I'd never intended to become
an actor. It was just something I'd done in high school. My passion
was playing baseball, and I went back and forth between baseball and
drama. An agent saw me in a school play and called me. I thought it
was a friend playing a joke. He sent me on an audition and that's
how I was cast in the play.''
   His other film credits include ``Stealing Home,'' ``Caddyshack
II,'' ``Girls Just Want to Have Fun,'' and ``Weekend at Bernie's.''
He was on the NBC series ``Gimme a Break'' in 1984-86. The producers
had a role written for him after seeing him on stage.
   In ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' which will be released in July,
Silverman and Andrew McCarthy play two insurance agents who stumble
across some information on a crime. They tell their boss, who turns
out to be the crook.
   ``The boss invites us to his beach house so he can have the Mafia
kill us,'' Silverman said. ``But they kill him instead, so it's two
guys with a body. There's a party going on in the house and no one
else is aware he's dead. It's a very black comedy.''
   What's next for Silverman? ``I'm being offered a lot of things,''
he said. ``I usually have to fight for things. This is a lovely
time. But I haven't decided yet what to accept.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Paramount Hopes For Another `Trek' Into Profits </HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The allure of ``Star Trek'' has long delighted
its followers and confounded its detractors. Star William Shatner
has an explanation.
   ``Is it possible that we're creating a mythology, that we touch a
mythological vein somewhere? The more I read and the more I think
about it, I wonder if the key to `Star Trek' is not all the
wonderful stuff we talk about: the character interplay, the sci-fi,
action and adventure and all those good things that seem to be on
the surface,'' he said.
   ``Somewhere underneath, the chemistry and the concept touch upon
a mythological need in modern culture. That's my real thought. I
don't quite know what I mean. It would take a far more intelligent
and perceptive person to divine what I mean.''
   Paramount Pictures takes a far less intellectual view of the
phenomenon. The company still makes nice rentals on the 1960s TV
series, and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' has prospered in
syndication. A $50 million gamble on the 1979 ``Star Trek: The
Motion Picture'' paid off handsomely. ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home'' was the highest moneymaker of the series, earning $57 million
in rentals.
   Now comes ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' directed by
William Shatner. Why would he want to take on the onerous job of
guiding an immensely complicated production?
   ``Directing a film is the end of the rainbow,'' he said in an
interview. ``You've seen those T-shirts: `What I really want to do
is direct.' What I really want to do is direct. I've directed
several stage plays, some television. I thought that directing a
huge, large-budget motion picture might be something that would be
the culmination of all my efforts.
   ``I was indeed the culmination of my career _ I don't know if
this will be the end of my career. It is certainly the top moment of
my life, and it was everything I hoped it would be.''
   Leonard Nimoy, who directed ``The Voyage Home'' as well as
``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``The Good Mother,'' gives his co-star
good marks as a director.
   ``I think he's terrific,'' Nimoy said. ``He has a quality which
is wonderful. It's an almost childlike desire to entertain, to tell
a story, to capture your attention, to surprise you and touch you,
make you laugh. He wants to do that: to be a fun storyteller. That
kind of exuberance will serve him well.''
   Nimoy also discussed the difference in their directorial styles.
   ``The joke is that in a William Shatner film he does a lot more
running and jumping,'' he said. ``He's much more physical as a
person than I am. I've always been a lot more sedentary, always made
more cerebral choices in my acting. He makes more physical choices.
He would rather do a chase than a conversation.''
   ``The Final Frontier'' was Shatner's baby from the beginning. He
submitted a 14-page original story about a messianic leader who
kidnaps the Enterprise and its crew and takes them to a faraway land
where he believes God resides. Producer Harve Bennett approved his
story idea, and the pair worked on the plot with David Loughery, who
wrote the script.
   Production was stalled by two industry strikes and Nimoy's
commitment to direct ``The Good Wife.''
   ``The Final Frontier'' had only 18 weeks in post-production,
Shatner said, which was about one-third of what was needed. The
speed may have contributed to bad previews which were reported in
the press. The movie was retooled for its wide release on June 9.
   With all of his directorial duties, was Shatner the actor
neglected?
   ``Interesting,'' he mused. ``If I had been handed this script and
somebody else was directing, I probably have gone in and said,
`Look, I don't think the character is quite focussed.'
   ``I might have shortchanged myself as the egotistical actor. Let
me rephrase that. I don't mean egotistical in the bad sense; I mean
in the actor whose sole point of view is the character.
   ``My job when hired for Capt. Kirk was to keep my focus on Capt.
Kirk, to protect Capt. Kirk, to make him as exciting and make him
move as well as possible,'' he said.
   ``I didn't want to do that with this film. I wanted to open
myself up and make sure the other characters were not only protected
but a great deal was made of them.''
   Shatner, 58, is a Canadian, born and reared in Montreal. He
started acting early.
   ``I began at the age of six, acting in camp plays,'' he related.
``I continued in Montreal amateur theatricals as a teen-ager. I put
myself through college with radio work. I went to the professional
theater when I graduated from the university (McGill), stayed in the
professional theater through thick and thin. I've never done
anything else but act, write and direct.''
   Trained in the classics at the Stratford (Ontario) Shakespeare
Festival, he made his Broadway debut in the festival's ``Tamburlaine
the Great.'' Shatner became one of the busiest actors in live TV
dramas, won an MGM contract and made his film debut in ``The
Brothers Karamazov.''
   For a time he bounced between the theater (``The World of Suzie
Wong,'' ``A Shot in the Dark''), films (``Judgment at Nuremberg,''
``The Outrage'') and television (``For the People'').
   In 1965, Gene Roddenberry produced a pilot of a new space series
starring Jeffrey Hunter as Capt. Christopher Pike. NBC gave it
thumbs down, declaring it too cerebral. Roddenberry shot a second
pilot for ``Star Trek,'' casting William Shatner as Capt. James T.
Kirk in what became something of a lifetime job.

<HEAD>More Big Companies Evacuate China; Banks Tighten Lending Policies</HEAD>

   U.S. banks are tightening lending guidelines for
Chinese-foreign business ventures because of the civil strife that
threatens to engulf China, and American companies are accelerating
their retreat from the country.
   Reversing its position of a day earlier, McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft Co. announced Tuesday it was evacuating
expatriates and was among the first companies to charter a plane for
the pullout.
   The Douglas Aircraft workers included 43 from a Shanghai factory
that assembles MD-80 twinjets, seven workers based in the southwest
city of Chengdu and one representative in the northeast city of
Shenyang.
   ``We've changed our situation in China. We decided last night to
begin pulling our people out of China back to Hong Kong,'' Douglas
Aircraft spokesman Donald Hanson said from company headquarters in
Long Beach, Calif. ``The situation apparently has changed
overnight.''
   Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. also was moving out its staff of about 30
workers housed near Beijing's Summer Palace and Hewlett-Packard Co.
was attempting to withdraw an unspecified number of people from
Beijing and Shanghai.
   Several other companies also ordered employees to leave China and
scrapped business trips there because of the growing fear of civil
war.
   The intensified effort to get employees out reflected the
deteriorating situation in Beijing since the weekend, when soldiers
killed hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators and other
civilians. Protests have flared in other cities and it has become
unclear if anyone is running the country.
   In another sign that the chaos may have a widening and profound
economic impact, U.S. banks began reviewing credit to companies that
do business with China and shortened time limits on new loans for
trade and investment projects.
   ``We're doing something all banks are doing, just making sure any
new commitments and any renewed commitments are kept very
short-term, three months or less,'' said an official of one major
New York bank, who asked not to be identified by name.
   An official of another big New York bank, who also requested
anonymity, said: ``It's obvious that any sensible country-risk
process would be operative under present conditions and commitments
would be reviewed.''
   Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Citibank
and First Chicago are among some of the prominent U.S. banking
companies with offices in China. Many established representative
offices there after relations were normalized a decade ago.
   The banks' main role is to expedite financing for joint ventures
between U.S. and Chinese companies, but their direct loans to the
Chinese are considered inconsequential and aren't reported in their
accounting statements.
   A study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. estimated that total U.S.
bank loan exposure in China was less than $1 billion.
   Nonetheless, China's government historically has been considered
an excellent credit risk and many other foreign banks have loaned
money to the country.
   The Institute of International Finance, a Washington research
organization for commercial banks, estimates China's foreign debt
totaled $42.4 billion at the end of 1988, of which 46 percent was in
commercial bank loans. But the size of the debt compared with the
country's overall economic output is small.
   ``A simple way of looking at it is that China doesn't have that
much external commercial debt,'' said Thomas Layman, the institute's
director for Asia and the Pacific.

   A Los Angeles television station was not
required to tell viewers that a toy maker was providing a children's
program in exchange for free advertising time, the Federal
Communications Commission ruled.
   The commission, in a ruling Tuesday that uphold's the common
industry practice of ``barter'' sales, denied a complaint that
KCOP-TV should have identified Mattel Inc. and TV syndicator Group W
Productions as the sponsors of the animated cartoon show, ``He-Man
and the Masters of the Universe.''
   The Los-Angeles based National Association of Better Broadcasting
had characterized the children's fantasy show as a non-stop
depiction of ``He-Man'' logo and ``He-Man'' toy products, which are
made by Mattel.
   The association said the barter arrangement, whereby Mattel and
Group W provided ``He-Man'' in exchange for two minutes of
commercials distributed throughout KCOP's children's program
schedule, constituted a ``token payment,'' given the cost of
producing the shows.
   The association said the producers spent $14 million to make 65
episodes of the program.
   The association, in a 1984 complaint, said Section 317 of the
1934 Communications Act requires that sponsors be identified
whenever shows are provided free or with only nominal payment.
   But KCOP valued the commercial time at $300,000 a year. At the
same time, it said that even if the payment were deemed ``token,''
Section 317 does not require sponsor identification when the
sponsors are mentioned incidentally or not at all in the broadcast.
   The FCC in 1985 denied the complaint, which had been joined by
Action for Children's Television. NABB appealed to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, which in September 1987 remanded the case to
the commission.
   The FCC denied the complaint again Tuesday.
   ``I guess it would be amazing if they had voted any other way,''
Peggy Charren, head of Action for Children's Television, said of the
3-0 FCC ruling.
   She said the problem of advertising messages slipped into TV
programs was ``one of the sorriest problems in all of broadcasting''
and that the FCC was saying they are ``going to let everything relax
on the subject of advertising and editorial content.''
   NABB President Frank Orme said his group would continue the fight.
   ``Whatever they have done, the court will have to approve,'' Orme
said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``I think eventually we will win
this.''
   Charren's group, which helped write a bill pending in Congress
that would re-impose limits on the amount of commercials on kids'
shows, had said various broadcasters were violating FCC regulations
by airing ``He-Man'' and seven other programs with substantial
product tie-ins.
   But the commission, in its 1985 ruling, said such the shows were
not program-length commericials. The commission said the
broadcasters ``had made a good faith determination that `He-Man' and
the other challenged programs possessed significant entertainment
value for child audiences.''
   The appeals court said the FCC had interpreted Section 317
incorrectly and it instructed the agency to devise a standard to
determine if Section 317 covers barter arrangements.
   In its ruling Tuesday, the FCC admitted it erred when it said
Section 317 applied only to broadcasts that were purely commercial
in content. As for determining a standard, it said KCOP clearly had
paid more than a nominal fee for ``He-Man,'' and Section 317,
therefore, did not apply.
   The commission said it was not its business to ``engage in a
detailed review of the adequacy of a broadcaster's payment in every
case in which a program discount is alleged.''
   It such such an approach would ``not necessarily further the
statutory objectives, is unlikely to yield conclusive results and
could require disclosures that cause substantial competitive harm to
program suppliers.''

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up, Share Prices Erase Gains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Wednesday morning, while share prices erased early gains and
declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 5.07
points Tuesday, lost another 15.04 points, or 0.04 percent, to
finish the morning session at 33,436.97.
   The dollar was trading at late morning at 142.88 yen, after
opening lower at 142.45 yen, down 0.18 yen from Tuesday's close of
142.63 yen. The currency moved in the range of 142.40 to 143.00 yen.
   There were two main incentives in the foreign exchange market
Wednesday: an incentive to buy due to the turmoil in China, and one
to sell sparked by a prime rate cut by U.S. banks, said Mitsuhiko
Kinugawa, a trader at Daiwa Bank.
   He said the buying pressure due to the situation in China was
stronger.
   Investors tend to purchase dollars in times of uncertainty or
crisis.
   ``Although Japanese investors don't have a feeling of emergency,
they are buying because of reactions overseas,'' he said.
   Many market players believe the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has
been easing its monetary policy since major U.S. banks lowered their
prime lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 11 percent Monday.
   The trader said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market by
selling the dollar to support the yen. He said the amount of the
bank's selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on its
monetary activities.
   On the stock market, the index fell marginally mainly due to
selling for profit-taking after earlier gains, while the majority of
market players remained on the sidelines.
   Other traders said turmoil in China contributed to the
wait-and-see mood in the Tokyo market.
   Japanese goverment has urged the swift evacuation of Japanese
residents in China. Many Japanese businesses in China have closed
temporarily and brought employees back to Japan.

   Share prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
rose for a second day Wednesday on reports that the power struggle

   Trading was active, and brokers said they were surprised by the
brisk activity.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips, which plummeted Monday in its
worst loss since the worldwide market collapse in 1987, closed at

   Volume totaled $296.5 million, up from $256.6 million Tuesday.
   On Monday, the index closed at 2,093.61 points, down 581.77
points from Friday. The drop was the worst since the 1987
international market collapse, when the index fell 1,120.99 points
in one day.
   The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., the territory's largest
bank, said it purchased shares for a third straight day to bolster
the market.
   Brokers linked the market's activities to reports that Chinese
troops responsible for attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators last

<HEAD>Mexico Will Cut Production 5 Percent Despite OPEC Agreement ^With
OPEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and other independent petroleum
producers will proceed with plans to cut exports by 5 percent even
if OPEC raises production as expected, the government news agency
Notimex said.
   The government news service Notimex on Tuesday quoted Raul Robles
Segura, assistant commercial director for the government oil
monopoly Pemex, as saying the cuts would not significantly hurt
business.
   Robles said that during the first five months of this year Pemex
already has exceeded its profit estimates for all of 1989 by 40
percent.
   Robles' remarks came as OPEC oil ministers meeting in Vienna
tried to restart stalled negotiations over a new production and
pricing agreement.
   Mexico does not belong to the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and is not governed by the group's agreements.
However, it historically has followed cartel guidelines.
   OPEC talks had centered on how to divide any additional
production among the member countries.
   The ministers seemed to agree on lifting production levels to
19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day, in
the last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-June
period is 18.5 million barrels daily.
   A Pemex statement released Tuesday quoted Robles as saying he was
confident that an OPEC production cap would help maintain petroleum
prices worldwide.
   Robles said that during the first five months of this year, Pemex
exported a daily average of 1.3 million barrels of crude oil with an
average price of $15.32 a barrel.

<HEAD>Goodyear Selling South African Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.,
one of the largest U.S. companies in South Africa, today announced
it is pulling out of the country after 42 years and selling its
assets to a South African company.
   A combination of economic and political factors were responsible
for Goodyear's decision to divest its Uitenhage, South Africa, tire
and general products manufacturing operation.
   The business will be sold to Consol Limited, an industrial
subsidiary of Anglovaal Ltd., a South African financial, industrial
and mining group.
   Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the company regrets leaving South Africa
after providing jobs there for more than four decades.
   But, in an announcement of the sale, he stated: ``It is becoming
increasingly difficult for American companies to obtain adequate
returns on investments there.''
   Barrett said the reasons for Goodyear's disinvestment included
U.S. sanctions against South Africa, double U.S. taxation of South
African earnings and the likelihood of a continuing decline in the
value of the South African rand against major currencies.
   The U.S. Congress in late 1987 enacted legislation that
eliminates a tax credit for U.S. companies that allowed them to
deduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S.
government.
   The former Reagan administration opposed the amendment and
considered fighting to have it repealed, but it remains the law.
   Former U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said at
the time the bill was passed that ``the most likely effect will be
to accelerate the takeover of U.S. assets by South African firms at
bargain prices.''
   Barrett said Anglovaal Ltd. was a reponsible group that had
demonstrated concern for human rights in the workplace and had
expressed intentions to retain the current workforce of 2,400
people, the majority of whom are black and colored.
   Mike McNamara, chairman and managing director of Goodyear's South
African business, said the company would continue to operate under
the same management.
   ``We have always taken great pride in our people and our
management team and employees have vast knowledge of the local tire
and rubber industry,'' said McNamara. ``For them, we will continue
to operate under present employment policies, practices and benefits
and all existing agreements and arrangements with our two trade
unions remain unaltered.''
   Goodyear began manufacturing tires in South Africa in 1947, the
year before the South African government adopted the apartheid
policy of racial separation.
   Over the years, Goodyear took the position that it could
contribute to social progress in South Africa by maintaining its
operations in the country.
   The company says it has spent more than $10 million in education
and training of blacks, housing and social programs in South Africa.
Goodyear has adhered to the Sullivan Principles, a set of guidelines
for companies operating in South Africa that address employment and
other practices.
   However, Barrett stated, ``with the prospect of ever-diminishing
returns on our South African investment, our responsibility to our
shareholders must take precedence.''
   The sale will result in a one-time charge of about $44 million,
after taxes, or 77 cents a share, which will be taken against
Goodyear's second-quarter results.
   Over the past five years, excluding Goodyear, 195 U.S. companies
have divested their holdings in South Africa.

<HEAD>Central Banker Says Cooperation Exists In Exchange Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of France Governor Jacques de Larosiere
said Wednesday that the top seven industrialized nations continue to
cooperate to keep exchange rates stable despite recent volatility in
world markets.
   ``There has been some volatility over the past month,'' he told a
bankers' forum. ``But what is important is that the international
cooperation put in play since 1985 is still operating.
   ``The seven major countries are on the same wave-length and do
understand the problems in the same fashion,'' de Larosiere said at
the end of the three-day International Monetary Conference attended
by members of 99 comercial banks from 22 countries.
   He said the major task of the cooperation was to keep inflation
down and sustain current economic growth.
   De Larosiere made the remarks to reporters after a closed meeting
with private bankers and central bank governors or senior officials
of the United States, Japan, West Germany, England and Spain.
   Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyd's Bank Plc, moderated the
central bankers' discussion and appeared later before reporters.
   U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Pohl participated in the closed-door panel but
did not attend the press briefing.
   Morse said Greenspan had told the bankers it was difficult to
correctly evaluate the recent rise in the dollar's value.
   But he said Greenspan indicated the dollar's rise appeared to be
more of a market phenomenon than the result of fundamental economic
factors.
   Morse said the central bank officials did not believe the dollar
``was likely to go raging on.''
   The Bank of England's Robin Leigh-Pemberton sai, ``The degree of
currency stability is still reasonably satisfactory'' if seen from
the view of whether it inhibits cross-border investment.
   He added that the markets had seemed to incorrectly imply that
the international coordination policy on exchange rates ``had given
up.''
   Takeshi Ohta, the Bank of Japan's deputy governor for
international relations, said policy coordination among the major
nations does not always mean taking measures ``at the same time in
the same direction.''
   But he said, ``We should be able to move swifly when necessary.''
   He and de Larosiere expressed concern over too much emphasis
being placed on monetary policy to attempt to cut back economic
imbalances.

   OPEC oil ministers today held a flurry of

   He predicted a deal could be struck within the next two days.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto raised the possibility that all 13
ministers would gather at cartel headquarters later in the day to
resume their formal strategy session.
   The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, then
broke up to bargain privately.
   The talks have stalled over a Kuwaiti demand for a much larger
share of any increase in cartel production in the last half of the
year. Other members, including influential Saudi Arabia, want the
increase shared proportionately among all the members.
   ``A lot of work needs to be done,'' Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Tuesday. ``We need about one or two days
for consultations,'' Aqazadeh said.
   A delegate from one nation, who demanded anonymity, said, ``It's
a deadlock.''
   The ministers seemed in agreement on lifting their production cap
to 19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day,
in the last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-June
period is 18.5 million barrels a day.
   The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their
benchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia had recommended
getting rid of the target price.
   The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5
million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under output
levels at that time.
   Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the
cartel's $18 benchmark.
   Prices have eased a bit recently as OPEC has turned up its
production. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the
cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late
November.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, has
been trading at more than $20 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, reported that the
OPEC nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day
in May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year.
   ``This was primarily the result of higher production in Kuwait
and Nigeria, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian and
Ecuadorian production,'' it said.
   The slippage in Ecuador's output, it said, was due to a landslide
that damaged the country's main oil pipeline.
   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for the
cartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about
20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demand
for the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.

   LIN Broadcasting Corp. shares shot higher
in early trading today in response to a $6.5 billion takeover offer
by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
   The $120-a-share unsolicitated offer, disclosed after stock
trading closed late Tuesday, would solidify McCaw's position as the
nation's largest cellular telephone company.
   In national over-the-counter trading early today, LIN was up
$24.25 a share to $127.25. McCaw rose $2.50 to $45.75 a share.
   McCaw, which is LIN's largest shareholder with a 9.8 percent
stake, has franchises serving customers in Seattle, San Francisco,
Miami, Denver, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.
   New York-based LIN operates seven network-affiliated television
stations and has interests in cellular systems serving New York, Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston. It also owns a specialty
publishing house that produces hard-cover tourist guides for hotel
rooms.
   LIN said in a statement it would ``study the offer carefully and
act in the best interests of its shareholders.''
   There had been speculation for months that McCaw would launch an
offer for LIN.
   LIN announced two weeks ago that its board had approved in
principle spinning off all of the stock in a new subsidiary that
would own its TV stations. It said it would operate its cellular
operations along with a specialty publishing business as a separate
company.
   LIN said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons
due to the differences in the nature of the television and
cellular-phone industries.
   The McCaw proposal was seen by industry analysts as a recognition
of the premium that the stock market has placed on the fast-growing
cellular business.
   ``Given the regional geographic and operational nature of the
cellular business, the logic of combining our two companies is
compelling,'' McCaw Chairman Craig O. McCaw said in a letter to Lin
Chairman Donald A. Pels.
   In the letter, McCaw called the $6.5 billion bid ``the highest
price per `pop' in the history of our (cellular) industry.''
   Pop, a yardstick in the industry, refers to market area
populations multiplied by percentage ownership in the cellular
systems serving those areas.
   McCaw's cellular telephone systems serve 50 million pops, while
LIN serves more than 18 million pops.
   ``The next stage in the development of American cellular
communications must be the rationalization of the many disconnected
fragments of our industry,'' the McCaw letter said. ``The McCaw-LIN
combination would hasten that process. ... We would thus advance the
effort to provide a truly national cellular network for American
consumers.''
   LIN's TV stations are KXAS in Fort-Worth-Dallas; WISH in
Inidianpolis; WOTV in the Battle Creek, Mich., area; WAVY in Hampton
Roads, Va.; KXAN in Austin, Texas; WAND in central Illinois; and
WANE in Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Last year LIN earned $82 million on revenue of $226 million.

<TEXT>
   The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted British
port employers an injunction banning a national dock strike.
   The strike had been planned for sometime this summer by 9,400
dockers affected by the British government's plans to abolish a job
guarantee scheme.
   The Court of Appeal's verdict overturns an earlier decision by
the High Court which refused to outlaw a dock strike.
   The Transport and General Workers' Union, which represents
dockworkers, is expected to appeal the verdict to Britain's highest
court, the House of Lords.
   Since the government first announced its intention to abolish the
dock labor scheme, under which employees are guaranteed lifelong job
security, a dispute has raged between employers and unions over
whether strike action would constitute a ``political protest''
against the government or a genuine ``trade dispute.''
   Under the 1982 Employment Act, political disputes are illegal.
   Last month, dockworkers at 46 British ports voted overwhelmingly
in favor of striking against the government's proposals.

<HEAD>Government Announces Sale of Short Brothers to Canada's Bombardier</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with financial and other details.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it would sell Short
Brothers Ltd., the ailing Belfast aircraft and missile maker, to the
Canadian aerospace company Bombardier Inc. for 30 million pounds,
about $47 million.
   The announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy
the state-owned company, which is Northern Ireland's largest
employer, after the government said it planned to privatize it.
   The Northern Ireland Office said Northern Ireland Secretary Tom
King and Bombardier Chairman Laurent Beaudoin reached a formal
agreement in Belfast this morning.
   As part of the deal, the government has pledged to invest ``a
substantial amount'' in Short Brothers, King said.
   The government will inject 372 million pounds ($584 million) into
Short Brothers and write off a 390 million-pound ($612 million) loan
it made to Shorts earlier this year to help the company pay its
debts.
   The injection is subject to the approval of Parliament, but the
Conservative government has a parliamentary majority that virtually
assures approval.
   ``Bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by Shorts
in the Northern Ireland economy and intends to acquire the company
as a long-term investment and to maintain it as a complete entity,''
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King told the House of Commons.
   ``Its objective is to develop the three main divisions of
aircraft, aerostructures and missiles,'' King said.
   Under the agreement, the Shorts name will be retained and the
company will be kept intact for the foreseeable future, King said.
But he said he could not guarantee all jobs would be retained.
   ``In the end nobody can absolutely guarantee jobs to anybody. If
a business is not competitive, if in spite of new investment, in
spite of new products, there is not the commitment and performance
and it is not competitive, then there cannot be any guarantee of
jobs,'' he said.
   The acquisition was expected to be completed later in the year,
subject to approval by Office of Fair Trading and European
Commission.
   Last month, Short Brothers announced it was laying off 700
workers, bringing the work force to 7,000, because of heavy losses.
The company lost $223 million lin 1988 and another loss is expected
this year.
   Short Brothers' most successful arm is its missile division but
it also makes its own passenger short-haul airliners, the 360
36-seater, and the 330 30-seater, as well as aircraft components for
other companies.
   Bombardier, based in Montreal, is a manufacturer of mass
transport vehicles. Its best known products are the Challenger
series of business, cargo and commuter aircraft made by its Canadair
aircraft manufacturing company.
   Bombardier has a 46-seat regional commuter aircraft under
development, the only serious rival to Shorts' FJX twin-engined
regional jetliner project, which now is to be scrapped.
   Bombardier also is involved in research and development of
missile components and pilotless surveillance aircraft.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After several weeks of internal debate, the
Federal Reserve has taken a cautious first step toward lowering
interest rates, many economists believe.
   The action, if followed by further moves by the central bank to
loosen its grip on credit, will spell lower borrowing costs for
businesses and consumers, including declines in mortgage rates, the
economists said.
   A move to lower interest rates would mark a major policy shift by
the central bank, which launched a campaign in March 1988 to push
interest rates higher in order to fight inflation.
   Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger refused to respond directly
to reporters' questions today over whether the Fed had indeed
loosened monetary policy. However, she said, ``Let me put it this
way: I have been opposed to further tightening since late last
year.''
   Ms. Seger, who has been a frequent dissenter inside the Fed
arguing for lower interest rates, responded with a terse ``no
comment'' when asked whether the Fed should do even more in pushing
interest rates lower.
   She said following a congressional appearance that it still
remained to be seen whether the Fed's year-long anti-inflation
campaign had slowed economic activity so much that the country would
topple into a recession.
   The Bush administration, which has been pressing the Fed to ease
up and keep the economy out of a recession, had nothing but praise
for the central bank on Tuesday, with the president's chief economic
adviser, Michael Boskin, saying he had ``utmost confidence'' in the
Federal Reserve.
   The Fed, as usual, made no announcement of any change in policy,
but economists who closely watch its activities said they believed
the central bank had eased slightly, based on declines this week in
the federal funds rate.
   This rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other to
make overnight loans, is considered the best early-warning signal of
Fed intentions.
   The central bank influences the rate through daily decisions
about how much money it will make available to the banking system.
   The federal funds rate had been averaging between 9.75 percent
and 9.88 percent, but it dipped to around 9.63 percent on Monday and
dropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday.
   ``The Fed has eased and we are looking for the federal funds rate
to go lower,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources
Inc., a private economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass.
   Ms. Latta and other analysts said they believe Fed policy-makers
have become convinced that the economy has slowed enough to ease
inflationary pressures.
   Starting in March 1988, the Federal Reserve had pushed short-term
interest rates up by 3 percentage points in a campaign to cool off
an overheated economy by making credit costlier.
   Eliott Platt, director of economic research for Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette, predicted that a host of business and consumer loan
rates will head lower in the months ahead as the Fed loosens credit
further in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession.
   On Monday, major banks announced that they were cutting their
prime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, the
first reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year.
   Platt said he looks for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percent
over the next three to six months.
   Other economists predicted that mortgage rates are headed lower.
Fixed-rate mortgages have already fallen to a national average of
10.48 percent last week, down from close to 11 percent at the
beginning of May.
   Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers,
refused to comment specifically on the question of whether the Fed
is now pursuing a credit-easing approach.
   During an appearance Tuesday at the National Press Club, Boskin
did say that the administration has a ``great deal of confidence''
that the central bank will steer a prudent course between fighting
inflation and guarding against a recession.
   Earlier in the year, both the president and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady had criticized the central bank for being overly
concerned about inflation at the risk of harming economic growth.
   Boskin said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to
err on the side of fighting inflation in January and February when
inflationary pressures were higher.
   But he said current signals show that the economy is slowing to a
more sustainable pace with inflation abating.
   Analysts said the May unemployment report, released last Friday,
probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed
to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. The
unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by the
weakest advance in job growth in three years.
   There were published reports last week that the Fed's
policy-making Open Market Committee, composed of the seven Fed
governors in Washington and five of the 12 regional Fed bank
presidents, was split on the question of lowering interest rates and
unable to come to a policy decision during two telephone conference
calls.
   Former Fed governor Lyle Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said the Fed may have held another telephone
conference call in recent days and decided to take a cautious first
step toward easing.
   But he said financial markets would be wrong to expect any quick
and dramatic moves to ease credit, such as a cut in the discount
rate, the interest the Fed charges to loan money to financial
institutions.
   ``I think the Fed will be cautious because we are not entirely
certain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' Gramley said.

   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A.
and the United Auto Workers have agreed to a union election at the
plant July 26-27.
   It will be the first vote on union representation since
production began at the plant southeast of Nashville in 1983.
   The plant, Nissan's only one in this country, manufactures light
pickup trucks and Sentra cars.
   The agreement Tuesday came after three days of testimony before
the National Labor Relations Board in which the parties argued over
which employees would be eligible to vote.
   Union officials have made the plant a priority. The UAW filed a
petition with the NLRB May 18 to hold the election.
   Union organizers said about 2,400 of Nissan's 3,200 workers are
eligible to join the union.
   Under the agreement, the collective voting unit will include all
hourly production and maintenance employees _ or technicians _
including the 176 lead technicians and maintenance apprentices.
   Excluded are all other personnel, including office, clerical,
professional, managerial, contract labor, guards and supervisors.

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines is in negotiations
to sell its South American routes to rival American Airlines, an
Eastern spokesman said today.
   ``We have talked to American,'' Jim Ashlock said from Eastern's
headquarters in Miami. He said Eastern also has had talks on the
routes with other airlines since announcing its plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier and sell around $1.8 billion in assets separately.
   Ashlock declined to identify the other carriers interested in the
South American network or to disclose Eastern's asking price.
   Ed Stewart, a spokesman for American at its headquarters in Fort
Worth, Texas, wouldn't confirm that the talks had taken place
although he acknowledged American's general interest in Eastern
assets. ``We're looking at things that might be for sale,'' he said.
   Wall Street analysts have estimated the value of the South
American routes at around $150 million.
   Any sales of Eastern assets must be approved by the federal
bankruptcy court. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from
creditors on March 9, five days after pilots and flight attendants
joined striking ground workers represented by the Machinists union
in a walkout that virtually grounded the airline.
   The court recently approved the sale of Eastern's prized
Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   For American, the nation's largest airline, a purchase of the
South American routes would bolster its strategy to expand overseas
operations.
   American, which recently added new flights to Western Europe,
also has expressed interest in Eastern's Caribbean routes.

   OPEC oil ministers today reached a
tentative agreement to raise their production a modest amount to
keep prices strong in the coming months.
   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries held a flurry of meetings to try to wrap up an
agreement.
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Celestino Armas, asked if a deal had been
struck, replid, ``Yes, of course.''
   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer said the new production ceiling would
be 19.5 million barrels a day. The current cap stands at 18.5
million barrels for the first six months of the year.
   But the cartel, according to analysts, has been producing above
that level in recent months.
   As a result, analysts say an increase of about a million barrels
in the supply cap should keep crude prices _ and consumers' gasoline
prices _ steady.
   Further details of the accord were not immediately available.
   It was unclear whether the agreement would span six months or be
for a shorter period of time.
   It also was not immediately known how the ministers had dealt
with Kuwait's demand for a higher production share.
   The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, then
broke up to bargain privately. The talks stalled Tuesday largely due
to Kuwait's demand for a much larger share of any increase in cartel
production in the last half of the year.
   Other members, including influential Saudi Arabia, want the
increase shared proportionately among all the members.
   The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their
benchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia had recommended
getting rid of the target price.
   The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5
million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under output
levels at that time.
   Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the
cartel's $18 benchmark.
   Prices have eased a bit recently as OPEC has turned up its
production. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the
cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late
November.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, has
been trading at more than $20 a 42-gallon barrel.
   The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, reported that the
OPEC nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day
in May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year.
   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for the
cartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about
20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demand
for the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices rallied to close higher Wednesday
inspired by gains on Wall Street and news of two big U.S. takeover
bids.
   The gains came against the background of a modest boost in
sterling, which helped to erase some of the lingering nervousness
from the pound's plunge last week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained for the
second straight day after five days of losses prompted mainly by
fears that sterling's weakness would force another rise in British
interest rates.
   The 100-share index closed 10.5 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at
2,117.9, near the peak of 2,118.1 moments before the close. The
market's low was 2,103.9 at midmorning.
   Volume was 481.0 million shares, up from 445.8 million shares a
day earlier.
   News of the U.S. takeover bids bolstered stocks in the
telecommunications and publishing sectors of the British market.
   Paramount Communications Inc. launched a $10.7 billion offer for
Time Inc. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. announced a $5.85
billion bid for Lin Broadcasting Corp.
   London shares were able to advance across a broader front in the
afternoon as Wall Street posted some early gains.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rancho Seco nuclear plant began
shutting down today after voters for the first time in U.S. history
decided to close a working reactor.
   With all precincts reporting, there were 111,867 votes, or 53.4
percent, against a measure that would have kept the plant operating,
and 97,460, or 46.6 percent, in favor. About 40 percent of
registered voters turned out.
   Tuesday's vote was not binding on the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District, which owns the 15-year-old plant, but a majority
of its elected board members had promised to abide by the will of
the people.
   ``The plant is in the process of being shut down today,'' said
Jeff Marx, a Rancho Seco spokesman.
   Marx said the mood is ``pretty somber'' at Rancho Seco, where the
jobs of many of the 1,500 to 2,000 employees and contractors are in
jeopardy. How many of those workers will be laid off is uncertain,
Marx said.
   SMUD General Manager David Boggs said he would put the plant into
``hot shutdown,'' in which the reactor is operable but producing no
electricity. SMUD will then confer with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission on putting the reactor in cold shutdown and beginning the
decommissioning, he said.
   He said he had already informed the SMUD directors of his plan to
shut down the plant and would not seek their approval. He lamented
the vote and said decommissioning and dismantling could cost more
than $210 million.
   Public Citizen, a group formed in 1971 by Ralph Nader, said in a
statement that the vote ``marks the beginning of the end for nuclear
power in the United States. ``America's love affair with the atom is
over,'' it said.
   Meanwhile in Fremont, a city of 165,000 on the San Francisco Bay,
a child-care tax measure that was touted as the first of its kind in
the nation was trounced at the polls.
   Measure B, which would have taxed residents and businesses to pay
for citywide child care, was supported by many working parents,
feminists and business leaders but opposed by activists who targeted
senior citizens, older families and Christian groups.
   With all precincts reporting, there were 3,671 votes in favor and
12,697 against. The measure needed a two-thirds majority to pass.
   Voters in the utility district that includes most of Sacramento
County and parts of Placer County gave Rancho Seco a reprieve in
June 1988 but put it on probation until Tuesday's vote.
   Critics claimed the plant 25 miles from California's capital is
unsafe and has a poor operating record. They also expressed anger at
rising utility bills and pointed to a $400 million repair bill after
a 1985 overcooling accident that caused a two-year outage.
   But supporters said the 913-megawatt plant's bad days were over
thanks to an overhaul and hiring of new managers.
   The expense of decommissioning Rancho Seco, together with the
higher cost of buying electricity from outside sources, is expected
to boost utility bills, but estimates vary widely as to how much.
Boggs predicted an initial increase of 7.5 percent in 1990.
   Kim Dellinger, a spokeswoman for the the campaign to keep the
plant open, called the vote ``a big mistake.''
   ``It was based on the historical performance of Rancho Seco and
frustration with SMUD, without considering the ramifications of
shutting the plant that supplies half the power of the community,''
she said.
   The vote Tuesday marked the first time in the nation that voters
chose to shut down an operating nuclear power plant, according to
Greg Cooke, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman.
   Nuclear opponents have won elections preventing new nuclear
plants from being built in some states.
   The nuclear industry, fearful that a closure vote could
strengthen nuclear opponents, raised $580,000 for the campaign to
keep Rancho Seco open.
   Opponents, including the Campaign California environmental group
formed by Assemblyman Tom Hayden and his estranged wife, actress
Jane Fonda, raised $111,000, according to the latest campaign
reports.

   Hershey Foods Corp. announced Wednesday it
will build a $100 million chocolate factory near its existing plant
here.
   Groundbreaking is set for late this summer for the plant, which
will be about 130,000 square feet and process chocolate for the
company's main factory.
   The new factory will have about 60 new employees. But start-up
will mean a reduction of employees at the main factory as new
machinery replaces older, less-efficient equipment, the company said.
   Hershey Foods President Kenneth Wolfe said it was not yet known
how many employees at the main plant will be affected. But he said
the company will try to ease job reductions through retraining and
attrition.

<HEAD>Economist Says 1988 Inflation Was 8-9 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet inflation was 8 percent to 9 percent last
year, about double previous government estimates, a top economist
said Wednesday.
   Abel Aganbegyan, an economic adviser to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, said a 4 percent to 5 percent increase in official prices
combined with another 4 percent rise caused by excess money
consumers can't spend due to shortages.
   Deputy Finance Minister Vyacheslav Senchagov termed Aganbegyan's
estimate too high. He said the official estimate for 1988 price
increases was 2.7 percent to 2.8 percent, not 4 percent to 5 percent.
   The two Soviet economists spoke at a conference ``The Soviet
Union in the 1990s'' sponsored by the International Herald Tribune,
the Soviet Union's Economicheskaya Gazeta and the Soviet Chamber of
Commerce.
   They said the Soviet Union is hampered by lack of proper
statistics to determine the actual rate of inflation.
   Soviet officials denied for years that inflation existed, but
under the influence of Gorbachev's reforms have acknowledged
inflation and begun to talk about how to combat it.
   Last October, deputy statistics director Nikolai Belov said wages
rose 6.7 percent in the first nine months of 1988, but real income
rose only 3.5 percent. But he refused to term the difference a rate
of inflation.
   Aganbegyan said Soviet economic reformers were hampered when
Gorbachev took power in 1985 by a lack of understanding of the
severity of problems. Economic managers made the situation worse by
boosting spending on housing, education and health but implementing
no cuts, he said.
   Aganbegyan said that aggravated a budget deficit, officially set
at 35 billion rubles, or $56 billion, this year. But economists said
including money the government borrows from its savings, the deficit
is more than 100 billion rubles, or $160 billion.
   Senchagov said the Soviet government plans to attack the deficit
by slashing construction expenditures and relying on a drive for
efficiency for added production.
   Plans for 80 billion rubles, or $140 billion, in capital
investments will be halved, and 390 new construction projects will
be eliminated, he said.
   Gorbachev already has announced a 14 percent defense budget cut.
   But Ed Hewitt of the Brookings Institute in Washington, who also
spoke at the conference, said he saw ``every prospect that the
deficit will increase.''
   He called for the government to stop a flood of ill-considered
economic decrees.
   ``They've come out quickly, they've been poorly coordinated, in
some cases fighting with each other,'' he said. ``That's basically
because the reform has gone half-way.''
   U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, who began his business career
with a deal with Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin to supply grain in
1921, told Western businessmen that flexibility would pay off in
dealings with the Soviet Union.
   ``Above all, you've got to have patience,'' the 91-year-old
Hammer said. ``I think it's worth it because they have a huge
population ... and they need everything.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders continued to cast
a wary eye on events in China.
   Wheat prices were pushed lower by heavy professional and
commission house selling because of civil unrest in Beijing and
other Chinese cities.
   There is some doubt among traders that the 1.85 million metric
tons of wheat sold to China, which was announced earlier this week,
will be shipped or paid for, said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``Although the Agriculture Department says there has been no
disruption of business in China, it is a situation that can change
day by day,'' Mao said.
   Added pressure was placed on wheat prices by forecasts for drier
weather in winter crop areas, which is expected to allow farmers to
move ahead with the harvest.
   Corn prices were down despite the announcement Tuesday of the
sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union.
   The forecasts for drier weather is expected to promote soybean
planting in eastern crop areas, while wetter weather in other areas
is expected to spur growth, forcing down soybean prices, analysts
said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 6\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.82 a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 4\ cents lower with July at $2.57 a bushel; oats were unchanged
with July at $1.62{ a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cent lower to 1 cent
higher with July at $7.11 a bushel.

<HEAD>American to Build New Maintenance Facility, Expand Another</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines continued its
expansion Wednesday, announcing it would spend up to $550 million to
build one maintenance facility and expand another to service the
airline's growing fleet.
   American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said the carrier will build
a $400 million maintenance and service facility at Fort Worth
Alliance Airport, ending a hard-fought battle between Texas and
Oklahoma that had involved the governors of both states.
   Crandall also announced a $150 million expansion of the airline's
current maintenance facility in Tulsa, Okla.
   Alliance Airport is 12 miles northwest of Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, where American is based and operates its
largest hub. American is the nation's biggest airline.
   The Alliance maintenance center will be built on 207 acres and
include a series of hangars, shops and support buildings. Initial
construction will start next January and cost about $222 million.
The first phase should be completed by the end of 1991, the airline
said.
   Initial employment will be about 2,500 people, but could exceed
4,500 by completion.
   Crandall said American will spend $150 million to add a hangar at
Tulsa, which will increase employment there by 1,600 people. The
Tulsa facility, already undergoing a $250 million expansion,
currently employs some 6,100 people.
   The larger maintenance operation has become necessary to service
American's expanding fleet, which will grow from about 480 jets
currently to about 752 by the mid-1990s. The carrier recently
announced several multi-billion-dollar contracts for new jets for
both its main operation and its commuter airline subsidiary,
American Eagle.
   AMR Corp., American's parent, recently announced record
first-quarter earnings of $101 million. AMR plans a $95 million
expansion of its headquarters building in Fort Worth and is working
on plans to build a $1 billion terminal at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and its commercial bank creditors
agreed Wednesday to reconvene debt-reduction talks in New York
Friday.
   Mexico's undersecretary of finance, Angel Gurria, and William R.
Rhodes, co-chairman of a bank-negotiating committee, said in a
statement that a two-hour meeting in Madrid ``set the stage for
rapid progress in the negotiations with the commercial banks.''
   The meeting coincided with a three-day International Monetary
Conference attended here by members of 99 comercial banks from 22
countries.
   After the debt meeting with Mexico, Rhodes, a Citibank executive,
told reporters, ``We have gotten a better understanding of what type
of funding and guarantees the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and
World Bank are willing to provide.
   ``We've heard from the official institutions, now we will have to
work out the details.''
   Mexico has criticized the commercial banks' attitude toward debt
rescheduling.
   Mexico owes $74 billion to about 500 commercial banks. Its
overall foreign debt totals $107.4 billion and is the second-highest
in Latin America, behind that of Brazil.
   The joint statement said the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank had explained ``the nature and extent of their financial
support for debt and debt service reduction transactions to be
negotiated by Mexico and the commercial banks.''
   Mexico is viewed as a test case for the Bush administration's
Third World debt strategy, which calls on commercial banks to
forgive a substantial part of their loans to heavily indebted
countries in return for guarantees the rest will be repaid.
   But it did not specify how much financial support the lending
agencies had offered.
   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus told reporters at a
separate news briefing that the Madrid meeting was ``very positive''
and provided an opportunity for the international lending agencies
to inform Mexican officials and the commercial banks their view in
detail.

<TEXT>
   Black Flag admakers will still the sounding
of taps when ants and roaches die at the end of one of its insect
spray commercials.
   Viewer complaints about a few notes of the bugle call sounded at
military funerals have prompted the company to alter the ad,
American Home Products Corp. of New York, maker of Black Flag
insecticides, said Wednesday.
   Company spokeswoman Carol Emerling said the notes would be
deleted within about two weeks in response to an unspecified number
of complaints.
   ``Taps is a symbol,'' said Korean War veteran Bill Temple of Bryn
Mawr, who called the company Wednesday to complain. ``It represents
the finality of someone's incredible sacrifice.
   ``To trivialize it by playing it after blasting a bunch of ants
and roaches away is terrible,'' he said.
   Ms. Emerling wouldn't say who prepared the commercial or how many
complaints it drew.
   ``It was not a large response, but when we heard from a couple of
people we took another look at it,'' she said.
   American Home Products usually examines ad content before airing
them to ensure they won't offend viewers, Ms. Emerling said.
   ``We really try to be quite careful, but every now and then
naturally judgments differ,'' she said.
   Temple has been behind drives to build a national Korean War
memorial and to have a 1986 Clint Eastwood film altered to reflect
that Army troops, not Marines, fought the monthlong battle at
Heartbreak Ridge, one of the bloodiest in the Korean War.
   ``I lost an awful lot of buddies during that time I was in
combat,'' he said. ``I know what taps means to the people who lost
friends and relatives.''
   Temple said a woman who answered the telephone at American Home
Products told him the company had received several other complaints
about the Black Flag ad.

<TEXT>
   With its engines spitting fire and its pencil-thin
nose outlined against gray skies, the sleek American spy plane set
down here Wednesday for its debut at the world's most famous air
show.
   The SR-71 reconnaissance jet has never been displayed outside the
United States, but it will be a featured attraction at the Paris Air
Show, where it will stand beside flying machines from the Soviet
Union and other nations.
   More than 365,000 people are expected to attend.
   The air show, which is to be opened Thursday by President
Francois Mitterrand, will include a celebration of the 20th
anniversary of America's walk on the moon.
   The show, held every two years, is to the air industry what the
Cannes film festival is to movies: a glitzy gathering where products
are promoted, aviation stars strut before reporters, deals are
announced and others are made.
   More than 1,000 exhibitors from 34 countries will be at the show
this year, and 140,000 industry professionals are expected. They cut
deals under the roar of aircraft flying nonstop demonstrations
overhead.
   Even before the show officially opened, the rainy skies over
Pari's Le Bourget airfield were filled with jets performing feats
that awed even jaded professionals in the midst of last-minute
preparations for the displays.
   After setting down in the SR-71, known as the Blackbird because
of its two vertical stabilizers and sleek profile, the pilot and
systems officer climbed out of the aircraft dressed like astronauts.
Before a crowd of photographers, they unfurled the blue, white and
red French flag.
   First delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, the plane was
developed by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as a long-range, advanced
strategic reconnaissance aircraft.
   It is one of the fastest and highest-flying in the skies today.
It cruises at altitudes above 80,000 feet and at speeds of about
3,100 feet per second _ more than three times faster than sound.
   The aircraft carries systems capable of surveying 100,000 square
miles in one hour, placing it in direct competition with newer, more
sophisticated satellites.
   The Soviets also gave a glimmer Wednesday of what their planes
can do.
   Their Soukhoi-27 _ being shown alongside two MiG-29 jet fighters
and the Soviet space shuttle Buran _ swooped, spun, and flipped high
overhead. At one moment, the high-speed plane seemed to stall dead
still, pulled its nose straight up, and flipped over on its back.
   Apollon Systvov, the Soviet Aeronautics Industry Minister, later
told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and
more openness in his country made it possible for greater
participation by the Soviets at this year's show.
   ``We want to give you an idea of the level of Soviet technology
and the expertise of our pilots,'' he said. ``But we do not deny the
commercial aspects and know there is a market for our aircraft.''
   The Soviet officials said he expected his country's space shuttle
to be the star of the show.
   He said Buran, which made its first unmanned flight last
November, has commercial possibilities as a satellite launcher.
However, he said his government will continue launching its
satellites with rockets.
   Buran's next flight is to be in 1991, he said.

   Stock prices gained ground for the second
straight session Wednesday in a busy session energized by two
takeover bids in the communications industry.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.00 to 2,512.32
on top of Tuesday's 15.62-point rise.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
983 up, 538 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 213.71 million
shares, up from 187.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 250.50 million shares.
   Time Inc. soared 44 to 170, after a delayed opening, on word late
Tuesday that Paramount Communications was making a $175-a-share cash
tender offer for Time, which has been planning to merge with Warner
Communications.
   Paramount shares rose } to 54} and Warner gained 1} to 53{.
   Separately, LIN Broadcasting jumped 26 to 129{ and McCaw Cellular
Communications gained 3} to 47 in the over-the-counter market. McCaw
made a $120-a-share offer for LIN.
   Those developments prompted speculative buying of other
communications stocks. For example, Racal Telecom rose 5 to 81 and
Centel picked up 4[ to 53.
   Regional telephone stocks also were broadly higher. Bell South
gained 1] to 51; U.S. West 1 to 71; Nynex 2| to 82|, and
Southwestern Bell 1 to 53~.
   Analysts said the overall market also continued to benefit from
evidence that the Federal Reserve might have begun to relax its
credit policy. The Fed this week has permitted, if not encouraged, a
modest decline in the interest rate on federal funds, overnight
loans between banks.
   Hopes that the central bank has succeeded in its bid to restrain
inflation and may now ease credit face a possible test on Friday,
when the Labor Department issues its monthly report on the producer
price index.
   Advance estimates call for the index to post an increase of 0.5
percent or 0.6 percent, up from 0.4 percent in April.
   Windmere dropped 2[ to 14. The company said its manufacturing and
shipping activities in the Far East have been curtailed by the
effects of the political turmoil in China.
   Windmere shares traded as high as 29 earlier this year before
worries about the situation in China started pushing them down.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $23.49 billion, or 0.73
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.41 to 182.34.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.72 to 373.82, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.71 at 326.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 5.24 to 453.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 364.41, up 3.57.

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers struck a deal Wednesday
night to restrain production in order to keep bolstering oil prices,
but crude futures tumbled in U.S. trading on indications that some
nations would continue cheating.
   The accord, signed by all 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in the sixth day of sometimes-tense
bargaining, lifts OPEC's official production ceiling to 19.5 million
barrels a day in the July-December period from the 18.5 million
barrels in effect for January-June.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark U.S. crude _ closed down 79 cents
at $19.67 a barrel.
   OPEC is limiting production in an attempt to support a price of
$18 a 42-gallon barrel in the last half of the year.
   Analysts say OPEC has been pumping an estimated 21 million
barrels a day in recent weeks, so the producing nations would have
to curb output to meet the new supply level.
   ``Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels,'' said OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman.
   If they do, analysts say, crude prices and gasoline prices at the
pump should hold steady.
   At their final strategy session, the ministers agreed that a
special committee would meet in September to review the oil market.
   ``If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the
ceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or
any other level agreed upon,'' read a statement released by the
ministers. Any adjustments would take effect Oct. 1.
   Under the accord, the 1 million barrel increase in the production
ceiling will be distributed proportionately among all members.
   Talks had stalled Tuesday over Kuwait's demand for a greater
share of any increase in the ceiling, and some Kuwaiti delegates
indicated that nation did not accept its new quota.
   Lukman, asked about Kuwait's position, told a news conference,
``Kuwait signed the resolution.''
   But Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah later told
reporters he had made a reservation to the agreement. He said he
would give details on Thursday.
   A Kuwaiti delegate, who demanded anonymity, said his government
doesn't feel bound by the quota assigned it under the new accord.
Another Kuwaiti delegate, who also sought anonymity, said Sabah
wrote those reservations in the margin of the agreement signed by
the ministers.
   Kuwait has been pumping well over its OPEC quota. If it continues
doing so, it would add to the world supply and possibly help weaken
prices.
   The United Arab Emirates also has persistently produced more than
its ceiling. There was no indication whether it intended to adhere
to its new target, although a Kuwaiti delegate said the U.A.E.
verbally expressed its reservations in the closed meeting.
   Prices have risen from near-term lows reached in late 1988,
partly due to OPEC cutbacks earlier in the year and to accidents
that temporarily disrupted supplies in key oil-producing regions of
the world.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
exceeded the $18 a barrel reference earlier in the year and prices
are up more than 40 percent since last November.
   In its insistence on a greater share of the increase, Kuwait was
pitted against influential Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude
exporters.
   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer walked out of the OPEC meeting
hand-in-hand with Sabah in an apparent attempt to signal their
differences were patched up.
   Nazer said several times during the bargaining that he wanted to
see prices rising.
   Kuwait, however, is concerned that higher prices will erode the
cartel's share of the oil market to non-OPEC countries, analysts
say. Higher prices encourage more production and more exploration by
producers.
   The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independent
producing nations ``with a view to soliciting their cooperation in
support of market stability.''
   Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail
their output some to help bolster prices.
   Under the agreement, Saudi Arabia's new quota will be 4.8 million
barrels a day, up from 4.5 million barrels.
   Iran and Iraq will have quotas of 2.8 million barrels a day, up
from 2.6 million barrels in the January-June period.
   Other quotas for the July-December period are: Algeria, 733,000
barrels per day; Ecuador, 242,000 barrels; Gabon, 175,000, and
Indonesia, 1.3 million barrels.
   Others included Kuwait, 1.1 million barrels; Libya, 1.1 million
barrels; Nigeria, 1.4 million barrels; Qatar, 329,000 barrels;
United Arab Emirates, 1 million barrels, and Venezuela, 1.7 million
barrels.

   Petroleum futures prices skidded Wednesday
despite OPEC's decision to restrain crude oil production more than
the market had expected.
   The contract for July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, dropped 79 cents to $19.67 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following
Tuesday's decline of 6 cents.
   The selloff was most severe in the wholesale home heating oil
pits. The July contract for No. 2 heating oil settled at 48.71 cents
a gallon, a loss of 2.29 cents on the day.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for July delivery fell 1.60 cents to 63.34 cents a
gallon.
   Madison Galbraith, an energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said the market reacted skeptically to the agreement
announced by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   The cartel's ministers, meeting in Vienna, decided to raise
OPEC's production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day for the July
to December period. The current output cap of 18.5 million barrels
daily expires at the end of this month.
   The agreement retains the cartel's benchmark price of $18 a
barrel for the last half of the year.
   But the OPEC ministers apparently didn't come up with a solution
to the problem of members exceeding their self-imposed output
quotas. The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels
a day in recent weeks, energy analysts say.
   ``The market told OPEC today: `We don't believe in you ... We
don't believe your numbers','' said Galbraith.
   The market initially displayed some strength when it was
announced that the new OPEC production ceiling was lower than the 20
million to 21 million barrels a day some analysts had anticipated.
   But doubts about OPEC's ability to abide by its accord created an
opportunity for traders to sell and collect profits. Selling was
dominated by large commercial energy brokers, Galbraith said.

   The dollar drifted in a narrow range in
foreign-exchange trading Wednesday and gold gave up part of the big
gain made late in the previous session.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $374 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $376.70 an ounce late
Tuesday. Gold had jumped about $12 an ounce in late trading Tuesday.
   The dollar held its ground despite a decline in the federal funds
rate to 9] percent, which confirmed to traders that the Federal
Reserve was easing credit policy by injecting fresh reserves into
the banking system.
   The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans between
banks, had hovered at close to 9} percent for months. Lower interest
rates would tend to discourage global investors from owning
dollar-denominated securities, but dealers said interest in the
dollar remained healthy.
   ``It seems like the dollar is still comfortable at this level
even if the Fed eased by one notch,'' said Eishi Wakabayashi, head
of foreign-exchange trading at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International
Inc. in New York.
   Traders continued to speculate that the Federal Reserve was
secretly selling dollars, but there was no confirmation of that,
said Jose Gonzalez, foreign-exchange manager at National Bank of
Detroit.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5815 to buy one pound, compared to $1.5665 late Tuesday. In New
York the pound rose to $1.5730 from $1.5710 on Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.17 yen to a closing 142.80 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.45 yen. In New York the dollar rose to 142.84
yen from 142.67 on Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday's rates
included: 1.9735 West German marks, unchanged from Tuesday; 1.7100
Swiss francs, up from 1.7095; 1.1975 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2010; 6.6867 French francs, down from 6.7060; and 1,436.2 Italian
lire, up from 1,434.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday's rates
included: 1.6965 Swiss francs, down from 1.7240; 6.6600 French
francs, down from 6.7360; 2.2138 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2370;
1,441.00 Italian lire, down from 1,443.00; 1.1967 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2015.
   Gold rose in overseas markets to catch up with the gains made
late Tuesday in the New York trading session.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $11.17 a troy ounce to a bid $376.61.
Gold jumped in London to a late bid price of $375.65 from $365.25 In
Zurich, the late bid was $374.50, up from $365.30 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $376.10 a troy ounce from $379.90 on Tuesday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.38 a troy ounce,
up from Tuesday's $5.28. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.464 an ounce from $5.431.

   When Martin S. Davis took over Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. six years ago, he had a vision for the conglomerate that
manufactured bedding products and clothes, turned out airplane
pistons and produced books and motion pictures.
   Davis, a corporate product of Gulf &amp; Western's Paramount
Pictures, focused on the company's highly-successful entertainment
and publishing businesses, and began to systematically pare almost
all its other segments.
   Now his sights have fallen on another media giant, Time Inc.
Paramount Communications Inc. _ which Gulf &amp; Western became after
changing its name on Monday _ offered late Tuesday to buy Time for
$10.7 billion.
   In a recent advertisement announcing its new name, Paramount
Communications described itself as a leader in entertainment and
publishing and a global communications company.
   Time, with holdings like Time-Life Books, Home Box Office and
American Television and Communications Corp., would fit right in
with Simon &amp; Schuster and Prentice Hall, part of Paramount's
publishing division, and its Paramount Pictures and Television units.
   It also would fit with Martin Davis' vision of what his company
should be.
   ``We will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book
publishing, as well as in motion picture and television production
and distribution, cable systems and cable programming,'' he said
about a Time-Paramount combination in a news release.
   Davis, who did not respond to a request for an interview
Wednesday, became chairman of Gulf &amp; Western in 1983 upon the death
of Charles G. Bluhdorn. The conglomerate then embraced a wide
variety of businesses: sugar, zinc, chemicals, energy products, race
tracks, Kayser-Roth apparel and hosiery, Simmons bedding and
automotive, electronic and construction products.
   Almost immediately he announced a restructuring plan for the
company, saying it had become too unwieldy and could not gain the
maximum profits possible from its many assets.
   Between the fiscal year that began in August 1982 and early 1987,
Gulf &amp; Western disposed of more than 50 operations and reduced its
number of major business segments from nine to three: financial
services, entertainment and publishing.
   The company, which once ran a large stock portfolio, also gave up
investing in other businesses.
   The restructuring slashed the company's annual revenue _ which
fell from $6.42 billion before the restructuring to $3.78 billion in
the year ended Oct. 31, 1986 _ but boosted profits in the same
period, to $267.4 million from $168.6 million.
   In its most recent fiscal year, ended Oct. 31, 1988, the company
reported revenue of $5.1 billion and income of $384.7 million.
   The businesses it kept were prominent and successful. Paramount
Pictures, for instance, has had some of the biggest movie hits in
recent years: ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Crocodile Dundee'' and the
``Star Trek'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' series.
   Earlier this year, Davis announced a further honing of his
company. Gulf &amp; Western said it would sell The Associates, the
nation's third-largest consumer finance company, and get out of
financial services altogether.
   It's not surprising Davis would have taken the company down the
path to becoming a communications conglomerate. He began working for
Paramount Pictures in 1958 as director of sales and marketing, later
moving up to vice president of the company's home office.
   By all accounts he is an aggressive and determined executive. In
1984 he set out to acquire Prentice-Hall; the bid was initially
rejected, but Davis won the publisher, paying $710 million.
   He appears equally adamant about winning Time. His $175-per-share
offer was nearly 40 percent higher than Time's closing price Tuesday
of $126 a share.
   Davis was undaunted by Time's proposed merger with Warner
Communications Inc., saying Time essentially put itself up for sale
by agreeing to merge with Warner.

   Copper futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on speculation that labor contract negotiations
at major U.S. copper producers will be accompanied by strikes.
   On other futures markets, precious metals were mixed, grain and
soybean prices fell, livestock and meat prices were higher and
energy futures declined.
   Copper rallied on word that officials of Magma Copper Inc.
expected labor contract talks to be difficult and expected a strike.
   Copper settled 2.25 cents to 2.45 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in June at $1.0885 a pound.
   Supply concerns were fueled by reports that Bougainville Copper
Ltd.'s supply contracts were delayed by the shutdown of its Papua,
New Guinea mine, said John O'Connell, an analyst with Refco Inc. in
New York. The mine has been damaged by attacks from native rebel
landowners.
   O'Connell said the rise in copper prices also could be attributed
partly to a comeback from a selloff spurred by the turmoil in China.
The nation is a big copper importer and traders reacted to the
upheaval there with a big selloff Tuesday due to speculation the
troubles would disrupt commerce and industry there.
   ``The markets are beginning to believe that the liquidation was
overdone,'' O'Connell said.
   Precious metal prices closed mixed on New York's Commodity
Exchange, following a runup of as much as $13 an ounce for gold on
Thursday. Silver continued the price rise that began Tuesday as the
dollar showed weakness.
   Gold was $2.40 to $3.80 lower with June at $376.10 a troy ounce;
silver was 3.3 cents to 3.6 cents higher with June at $5.464 a troy
ounce.
   Energy futures fell sharply in volatile trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in the wake of OPEC's new production agreement.
   Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, meeting in Vienna, agreed to boost output to 19.5 million
barrels a day for the last half of the year, up 1 million barrels a
day from the current ceiling.
   ``The ceiling is not high enough,'' said Robert Baker, an analyst
wtih Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``How many
nations will overproduce to get to higher level, the market just
doesn't know.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 53 cents to 79 cents lower
with July at $19.67 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.29 cents
lower with July at 48.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.32
to 1.60 cents lower with July at 63.34 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   There is some doubt among traders that the 1.85 million metric
tons of wheat sold to China, which was announced earlier this week,
will be shipped or paid for, said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Corn prices were down despite the announcement Tuesday of the
sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union.
   Forecasts for drier weather are expected to promote soybean
planting in eastern crop areas, while wetter weather in other areas
is expected to spur growth, forcing down soybean prices, analysts
said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6\ cents lower with July at $3.82 a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 4 cents lower with July at $2.57\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged with July at $1.62{ a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $7.11 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 68.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with
August at 79.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent higher
with June at 48.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent
lower to 1.32 cents higher with July at 31.77 cents a pound.

   An energy company has agreed to pay a
reported $2.75 million to eight families who discovered in 1987 that
their homes sat atop a toxic waste dump, officials said Wednesday.
   The settlement was announced at a meeting attended by the
families, local officials, mediators who helped construct the deal
and representatives of Colonial Gas Co., which once dumped on the
site.
   Colonial Gas acknowledged its coal-gasification byproducts were
dumped decades ago where the families' homes were later built.
   Railroad debris, leather, hospital bandages, bottles, light
bulbs, drums, metal paint cans, ash, paint, dye and rubber shoe
scraps were among the waste dumped at the site when it was known as
Costa's Dump from the 1920s to '40s.
   The families reported seeing blue soil and camphor-like odors in
1987 to the state Department of Environmental Quality Engineering.
   Under the settlement, Colonial Gas will buy the homes, pay
damages and finance the continuing cleanup costs at the site near
the Concord River in this city about 35 miles north of Boston.
   The agreement will provide each family with approximately
$250,000, the parties said. Colonial Gas reportedly also has agreed
to pay $750,000 to the DEQE for the testing and fencing and cleaning
the site.
   Colonial Gas attorney Ralph Child the cleanup would not begin for
at least a year. He said the houses either will be razed,
transported to another location or left on the site during cleanup.
   As a provision of the agreement, the families will not be allowed
to seek further damages for future health problems.
   In a report, the DEQE found the site ``does not currently pose an
immediate threat to the health or welfare of abutters to the
property.''
   But it said the area was unsafe to live on and ``remedial actions
were necessary'' to ensure the protection of the families and future
users of the site.
   The families, whose members complained about health problems
including headaches and asthma, were reolcated together to a
condominium complex in another town. The mediation took six months.

   A sewing machine company that closed its
Massachusetts plant in 1981 has been ordered to rehire the entire
workforce and make up eight years of lost earnings for up to 190
employees, officials said Wednesday.
   Jubilant workers hailed the decision by the National Labor
Relations Board as vindication of their claim that the company,
Reece Corp. of Waltham, moved operations to Maine and overseas to
escape a costly union contract.
   ``Maybe this will show people that unions hang on and defend
people, we're not just dues collectors,'' said Vincent C. Ofria,
president of the 2,000-member Local 1596 of the United Auto Workers,
which represented the Reece employees.
   It's not clear what how much total back pay might be owed. The
NLRB must hold a separate hearing to determine that.
   Labor lawyers said the decision did not chart new legal ground
but appeared to mark a shift from the NLRB's decisions under former
President Reagan, when the board steadily strengthened management
rights at the expense of unions.
   Peter J. Abate, Reece's president and chief executive officer,
said the company would appeal the order, which could cost it
millions of dollars, in court.
   The exact amount of back pay remains to be determined through a
separate NLRB hearing. Joel Gardiner, an attorney in the NLRB's
Boston office, said the hearing won't be held until after the
company's appeal.
   Reece, a 108-year-old firm that had sales of $59.5 million last
year, announced in April 1981 it would close the plant, which made
industrial machinery for sewing buttonholes and pockets.
   Approximately 190 workers were laid off, and the operations were
transferred to plants in Gorham, Maine, and Leiden, the Netherlands.
   A three-member NLRB panel issued its decision in Washington on
May 31, but it was not received by the parties until this week.
   By a 2-1 vote, the panel overturned a 1982 decision by an
administrative law judge who had found that the company had a
contractual right to shut the plant.
   The NLRB interpreted the contract more narrowly, ruling that
neither a management-rights clause nor a paragraph covering
severance pay eliminated the company's obligation to bargain with
the union over the plant's future.
   ``By refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith with the
union ... the company has engaged in unfair labor practices,'' NLRB
Chairman James M. Stephens and board member Mary Miller Cracraft
wrote.
   The NLRB ordered Reece to make up any difference between what the
workers have earned over the past eight years and what they would
have earned at the plant.
   Workers at the Reece plant earned an average of more than $9 an
hour, and many who were paid at piece rates made more than $14 an
hour.
   The company also was required to offer the Waltham employees
immediate reinstatement to their former jobs, and if those jobs no
longer exist, to equivalent positions at the company's other plants.
   The board said the company would have to pay the workers' moving
costs and, if necessary, make jobs for them by dismissing employees
hired after the plant closing.
   The NLRB did not explain why it took nearly seven years to decide
the case. However, lawyers said the board has been struggling with a
significant backlog, and delays of three years or longer are common.
   The dissenting board member, Wilford W. Johansen, argued the UAW
had waived its right to bargain over the plant's future by agreeing
to put the management-rights and severance pay clauses in the
contract.
   Alan H. Shapiro, a Boston labor lawyer, called the decision ``a
good precedent from a union perspective.''
   ``It sounds like this kind of a decision _ in which the board is
not willing to buy into a waiver-by-contract argument _ is shifting
away from the Reagan years, when they found waivers in everything,''
Shapiro said.

<HEAD>Metropolitan Buys J.C. Penney Casualty Insurance</HEAD>

   Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
Co. announced Wednesday it would buy Ohio-based J.C. Penney Casualty
Insurance Co., which the retailing giant had said it wanted to
unload.
   The price was undisclosed. ``We don't anticipate it being a
significant loss or gain for us,'' said J. Duncan Muir, a spokesman
for J. C. Penney Co. at the retailer's Texas headquarters.
   The casualty insurance subsidiary, headquartered in Westerville,
Ohio, lost $7 million on premiums of $168 million last year, about
80 percent of it in auto insurance, Muir said. It had about 350,000
policies in force.
   Metropolitan Property and Casualty, a subsidiary of Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. of New York, earned $40 million on premium income
of $543 million last year. It had 1.1 million policies, said
spokeswoman Liz Ostrowski.
   J.C. Penney will keep its life insurance subsidiary, Muir said.
Unlike rival Sears, Roebuck and Co., Penney had been unable to
produce a satisfactory package of financial services to sell through
its stores, Muir said.
   ``The direction of our company is to become a department store.
We found that people did not choose to make financial decisions at
the same time they were shopping for apparel,'' he said.
   Ms. Ostrowski said Metropolitan would probably keep Penney's
over-the-counter insurance sales force in place for up to 18 months
after the expected closing of the sale later this summer, then fold
those operations into Metropolitan's existing sales force of agents,
direct-marketing specialists and Century 21 real estate agents.
   Less certain was the future of 770 employees at Penney Casualty's
headquarters in suburban Columbus. Metropolitan would keep a service
center there, but staffing levels had not been decided, Ms.
Ostrowski said.
   Metropolitan, which writes most of its business in the Northeast,
wants to expand to the Midwest and South, Ms. Ostrowski said. Penney
Casualty wrote nearly half its premiums in 1987 in Ohio and
California, with other significant amounts in Pennsylvania and
Georgia, according to A.M. Best Co., an industry rating service.
   Best gave Penney's insurance operations a B-plus rating last
year, which one expert said is generally the lowest rating accepted
by insurance brokers. Metropolitan improved from B-plus to A-minus.

<HEAD>Third World Debt Dropped $12.4 Billion in 1988</HEAD>

   Debts of the Third World to commercial banks
dropped by $12.4 billion last year, partly because banks used the
money to buy local assets, according to new figures from the
International Monetary Fund.
   The fund did not give totals in its monthly IMF Memorandum,
distributed this week, or the debts of individual countries. It
classes 130 countries in the Third World as ``developing.''
   According to the World Bank, its sister organization, Third World
debt now comes to $1.3 trillion. Michel Camdessus, the fund's
managing director, said banks hold about 60 percent of it. Most of
the rest is owed to governments and intergovernment bodies such as
the fund itself.
   Both organizations, owned by the same 151 governments, have
pledged to help reduce the debt further, as urged by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. They are pressing private banks to go
along by forgiving some of the debt in return for assurances that
interest will be paid promptly on what is left.
   There was a drop of $17.3 billion in the amount owed by the 15
countries singled out as specially troubled by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III when he was secretary of the Treasury in 1985.
The World Bank calculates that they owe about $520 billion. They
include Argentina and Venezuela, where price rises linked to debt
have brought bloody rioting recently.
   According to the fund, the reduction in the debt owed to the
banks is not due to repayments but to other operations.
   The banks disposed of $8.7 billion worth by using what the fund
calls official conversions. These include conversion of the debt
from dollars or other hard currency into the money of the debtor
country, and then buying shares of stock in local industry.
   Chile has taken the lead in these ``debt-equity swaps.'' In
Mexico, Brazil and other countries the swaps have been criticized as
contributing both to inflation and to the sale of too many important
assets to foreigners.
   The banks also sold off at a discount debts with a face value of
$8 billion. Some Third World debt brings as little as 10 cents on
the dollar in the market. After a sale, the debtor country still
owes the full face value to the new purchaser, but nothing to the
bank.
   In addition to the 15, more than 100 other Third World countries
are classified by the fund as ``developing.'' In 1987, the debts of
all of them to the banks increased by $18.7 billion.
   Debtor countries complain mostly about the burden of interest
payments. Camdessus reported last week that debtors fell another $11
billion behind on their payments in 1988. These are largely interest
payments, since few debtors have paid back much principal since 1982.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Says Prime Computer Has Beefed Up Its `War Chest'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   MAI Basic Four Inc. said Wednesday it had filed a
lawsuit opposing the postponement of Prime Computer Inc.'s annual
meeting, where it plans to wage a proxy battle for control of the
company.
   The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, seeks to compel the
Natick-based computer maker to hold the meeting June 14, as
previously scheduled.
   Prime announced Tuesday that it would delay the meeting until
July 26 to give its stockholders time to consider MAI's recent
reduction in its hostile tender offer, from $20 a share in cash to
approximately $19 a share in a mixture of cash and securities.
   MAI is a Tustin, Calif.-based computer company controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow. It has been pursuing Prime, a maker
of minicomputers and computer-aided design equipment, since November.
   On June 1, MAI cut its bid to $19.50 in cash for about 75 percent
of the shares on a fully diluted basis, plus securities with a face
value of $21 per share for the remaining 25 percent of Prime's stock.
   Since the securities are likely to trade at less than face value,
many analysts have valued the new offer at $18 to $19 a share.
   MAI also said Wednesday that Prime has put an additional $5
million into a war chest to oppose MAI's hostile takeover bid and
defend ``tin'' and ``golden'' parachute arrangements.
   Prime previously announced charges totaling $15.4 million for
legal, investment banking and other costs associated with fighting
MAI's tender offer.
   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Prime said its board authorized a $5 million letter of credit to
cover legal costs for defending its employee protection and
executive retention agreements.
   Those agreements, known generically as tin and golden parachutes,
provide payments ranging from a few hundred to many thousands of
dollars to soften the landing for ordinary workers and top
executives who bail out of the company after a takeover.
   MAI has claimed the arrangements could cost the company up to
$170 million and has pledged to fight them in court.
   MAI charged Wednesday that Prime has ``apparently deliberately
chosen not to publicize this new $5 million commitment.''
   Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan declined to comment directly on
MAI's statement.
   Prime stock closed unchanged at $16.50 a share in composite
trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
