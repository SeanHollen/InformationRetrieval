<HEAD>Fighting Inside Burma Spills Over Border Into Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mortar shells from fighting between Burmese
troops and rebel forces destroyed 55 houses and wounded two people
at a village just inside the Thai border, a senior police officer
said today.
   Col. Amphol Ngamchit, police chief of Tak Province, said a woman
and a young girl were wounded in Mae Salit village, which straddles
the Burma-Thailand frontier. Damage was estimated at $500,000.
   The fighting Friday was part of an intensified campaign by the
Burmese military against the Karen National Union, the strongest of
a dozen ethnic minority organizations seeking greater autonomy. The
Karen groups fields about 4,000 guerrillas and operates primarily
along the rugged Thai border.
   Brig. Gen. Khin Nyunt told journalists in Rangoon, the Burmese
capital, that Burmese forces captured the Karen stronghold of Kler
Day a week ago and last Thursday seized Maetri, another Karen
settlement.
   Thai officials said hundreds of armed Karens fled to areas
southeast of Kler Day where the guerrillas hoped to regroup.
   Late last year, the Burmese army retook the vital border village
of Mae Tha Waw, disrupting the rebels' main source of revenue _ a
lucrative smuggling trade between Burma and Thailand.

<TEXT>
   The victims arrive day and night at the
sand-bagged Red Cross Hospital: men with shattered legs or stomachs
ripped open by bullets, and children burned by anti-missile flares.
   There are fears of worse to come as the last of the Soviet troops
depart Afghanistan in the next few weeks to try to meet a Feb. 15
deadline.
   The nation's pro-Marxist regime led by President Najib will be
left with its poorly trained army to face the guerrillas alone, and
some Western diplomats say the guerrillas will win.
   Gunfire and explosions have been heard regularly the past few
nights, and rifle-toting Afghan soldiers are deployed throughout the
city.
   The Swiss-run International Red Cross opened the 50-bed hospital
in October in a villa beside the frozen Kophen River in central
Kabul. It has 16 foreign and 140 Afghan staff members.
   Victims arrive in ancient taxis or are carried by relatives.
   Some of the latest arrivals were shot or wounded hours earlier by
mines, which are planted around Kabul and villages in the
surrounding hills.
   Other victims were wounded weeks or months ago and have infected
limbs, sometimes the result of botched surgery at government
hospitals.
   As several victims arrived, Ingrid Andersson, the Swedish chief
nurse, cajoled an apprehensive middle-aged man into giving blood for
the relative he had brought in with shrapnel wounds to the chest.
   Minutes later word came that seven more patients were on their
way. Nurses chased relatives from a waiting area to make room, and
set up brightly colored lounge chairs as temporary beds.
   ``There's a lot of shooting in the city. Most of the ones coming
now seem to have been hit by stray bullets,'' said Dr. Kari
Koskinen, a Finnish surgeon.
   Koskinen's three-member team and one led by Dr. Brian Hewitson, a
British surgeon who arrived this week, alternate shifts and are on
call around the clock.
   Most of the foreign staff, from a half-dozen Western European
countries and Australia, New Zealand and Canada, have worked civil
wars in Asia, Africa and Lebanon, and in Thailand's refugee camps.
   Many say they sense there is a lot more killing to come in
Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978, and Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979. Since
then, an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the civil
war, and one-third of the nation's population of 15 million has
sought refuge in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   In the past two weeks, the Red Cross has readied a 100-bed
extension to the hospital.
   ``I just have the impression that this is the beginning of a
very, very bad time,'' said Robert Keusen, a Swiss radiographer and
laboratory technician who arrived eight months ago from Uganda. ``We
could set up a hospital for 500 patients, for 1,000, it would still
be too small.''
   But somehow, the hospital staff finds room for the wounded.
   Beds are jammed together. An old man with leg injuries lay
semi-conscious next to a cheerful 12-year-old boy who was shot in
the spine four months ago during a clash betweeen guerrillas and
government troops outside Kabul. The boy will never walk again.
   A 10-year-old girl shows a visitor the healing burns that cover
her left leg.
   At the Red Cross artificial limb center in the city's industrial
district, French physiotherapist Christoph Etienne makes tough
choices daily.
   There's a waiting list of 1,500. Most of the patients are
disabled soldiers, but women and children get priority, followed by
young men over old, and amputees with one leg over people who have
lost both legs and are least capable of using artificial limbs.
   The center opened in 1987, making it the first international
facility the Afghan government allowed into the country to help the
war-wounded.
   The Red Cross has run hospitals and clinics in Pakinstan
throughout most of the Afghan conflict, mainly serving civilians and
guerrillas.

   Thousands of jubilant Republicans celebrated
George Bush's brand-new presidency at 11 inaugural balls Friday
night, and during a fast-paced tour of the merrymaking Bush took a
few reluctant whirls around the dance floor.
   He called himself ``a lousy dancer'' and told one crowd rocking
to the music of Lionel Hampton: ``I hope you don't judge my being a
president by the way I dance.''
   A chill wind whipped evening gowns and fur stoles as 60,000 party
faithful thronged from Union Station to the National Air and Space
Museum to the Kennedy Center on the banks of the moonlit Potomac for
a night of dancing and carousing.
   Inside the Kennedy Center, the air was hot and thick as 5,000
guests were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder in the Grand Foyer to
awaiting the president's arrival. Several people fainted, and for
one woman, the crowd was so dense that she couldn't fall down after
she passed out.
   Hours after he was sworn in as President Reagan's successor on
the steps of the Capitol, Bush began his tour of the invitation-only
balls with a visit to an American Legion affair for 149 Medal of
Honor winners _ including freshman Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. _ and
other military heroes.
   ``I'll do my level best to be a president who respects the
military ... and keeps the United States of America strong,'' said
Bush, who was accompanied by former Rep. Edward Derwinski, R-Ill.,
his choice to be secretary of the new Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Bush also let slip that he's not particularly keen on dancing.
``This is the first formal event ... and perhaps the most humane,''
he said, ``a ball at which you do not have to dance.''
   But by the time he reached Union Station, the president finally
took his wife, Barbara, onto the dance floor as the band struck up
``I Could Have Danced All Night.''
   ``You can say that you saw it first here,'' Bush said, ``a lousy
dancer trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the
United States of America.''
   A while later, at the cavernous Pension Building, the president
quipped, ``the Bush family is going to give dancing a bad name.'' He
took a few turns with Mrs. Bush and stopped abruptly. ``That's it,''
he said. ``That's the only step I know.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle apparently felt the same way. He told
revelers at another hotel ballroom that ``I guess protocol allows
you to witness my inability to dance.'' Quayle then took a few stiff
turns on the dance floor with his wife, Marilyn, as the band played
a tune from ``My Fair Lady.''
   Tickets to the nine crowded black-tie balls sold for $175 each,
assuring guests the privilege of jostling for drinks at cash bars
and catching brief glimpses of Bush and Quayle. Tickets were easier
t obtain for two casual-dress balls for the 30-and-under crowd,
where the drinks had more fizz than kick.
   ``To be included in this is incredible,'' said Kerry Trost, 16,
of Fairfax, Va., who got her $30 ticket from a friend and joined
several thousand other youngsters in dancing to loud recorded rock
music and videos.
   When Bush showed up at one of the youth balls, he recalled the
inaugural parade and said, ``It was the young people that brought
that thing alive.''
   Outside one hotel, a group protesting the killing of animals for
their fur hides picketed arriving guests, many of whom wore fur
coats. The demonstrators carried signs reading, ``Fur Is Murder''
and ``I'm Warm. I'm Not Wearing Fur.''
   A star of one hotel ball was 7-year-old Jessica Catonia, the
current Little Miss Buffalo. The girl's mother, Sharon, said her
daughter was conceived at the same hotel during Reagan's first
inauguration in 1981.
   Before the hoopla began, inaugural officials had said a $175
ticket to the black-tie events, reserved for invited guests, would
get them little more than ``the honor of being there.'' Bars at each
site were charging for drinks, there was no food and the dance
floors promised to be gridlocked.
   The partying continues Saturday with scores of social events
around the capital, including a ``Black Tie and Boots'' ball for
5,500 Texans that sold out within 24 hours.
   The four days of inaugural festivities costing a record $22
million to $25 million will end with a Sunday morning worship
service at Washington Cathedral which was requested by Bush.
   One highlight of the week was a two-hour variety show Thursday
night at the Washington Convention Center, where Bush and Quayle
joined 12,000 black-tie guests in applauding big-name performers
from Frank Sinatra to country singer Loretta Lynn.
   The gala was broadcast live on television and grossed about $9
million from ticket and TV commercial sales to help defray costs of
the privately financed inauguration week.
   Meanwhile, those protesting the policies of the Reagan
administration and what they fear will be those of the Bush
administration held their own Counter-Inaugural Ball at the Crispus
Attucks Museum on Friday night, with a $6 to $10 sliding scale
admission charge.
   The dance party was arranged by the Counter-Inaugural Coalition
for a People's Agenda, a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the
Gray Panthers to the Student Coalition Against Apartheid and Racism.
   Those attending were asked to wear ``their finest trash,'' said
Michael Hasty of the Washington Peace Center, a member of the
coalition. Live music was planned for the first hour, followed by a
disk jockey playing tapes ``so people can dance the night away.''

<HEAD>Restaurateur Defends Exotic Male Dance Fund-raiser For Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLARKSBURG, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restaurateur who held an exotic
male-dance show to raise money for a shelter for the homeless says
she doesn't understand why some people objected to the show.
   ``I can't understand the uproar'' over Friday's show, said Sandra
Beaudin, owner of the Mountainview Restaurant in this northwestern
Massachusetts town. ``I just thought it would be nice (for patrons)
to donate $10 and get something in return.''
   However, some people in nearby North Adams strenuously objected
to the show, saying they believed it was in poor taste.
   ``I don't think it's right to hire male dancers for a cause like
this,'' said City Council Member Paul Babeu. ``It tarnishes it
somewhat.''
   Ms. Beaudin said she sold all 220 tickets nearly a week before
the two-hour performance, and said she was pleased it all worked out
well.
   ``Now I feel fine,'' she said. ``I was just hoping it went well
because it really is to benefit the homeless. People are just having
a good time.''
   Ticket sales brought in about $2,000. The money will go to a
24-bed shelter for the area's homeless, which welfare workers say is
urgently needed to house the increasing numbers of families seeking
shelter.
   Northern Berkshire Community Action _ a branch of the private,
non-profit Berkshire Community Action Council which uses state
grants to help the homeless _ has been handling 10 to 15 family or
individual cases a month, said branch Director Theresa Louison. That
compares with one case every month or two five years ago.
   Ms. Beaudin said the situation prompted her to look for a
creative solution. She held a spaghetti supper fund-raiser in
November, but made only $900. She said she saw the dance as an
easier way to raise money.
   The Clarksburg board of selectmen waived the usual $75
entertainment license fee so Ms. Beaudin could use the money to hire
police guards.
   ``She has the right to put it on if it's done properly and there
is no physical contact,'' said Selectman Edward Deneault, who added
that he had heard no complaints from people in the town of 1,890
people. ``Most of the people doing the complaining are from North
Adams.''

   Morton Thiokol successfully tested its
redesigned space shuttle booster Friday, firing the rocket in colder
weather than that which contributed to the Challenger disaster.
   ``The nation has a new president today and a new success in its
space flight program,'' said Royce Mitchell, NASA's solid-fuel
rocket motor project manager at the Marshall Space Flight Center, in
Huntsville, Ala.
   The $20 million test, the last of six qualifying tests, was
designed to show the strength of the rocket's casing and the
behavior of its solid-fuel propellant, which hasn't as much
``oomph'' in cold weather, Mitchell said.
   Early test data showed the propellant's burn rate was normal for
the conditions and there was no evidence of the uneven burning that
could have occurred at that temperature, he said.
   The horizontal 126-foot-long booster, its 1.1 million pounds of
propellant chilled to a coldest-ever 40 degrees, was fired for 125
seconds at the company's Wasatch Operations center 25 miles west of
here.
   The bright orange plume from the rocket's tail melted the snow
from a nearby hillside during the test, which was delayed for 90
minutes by a lack of wind to blow away dust from the blast. About
300 company and space officials cheered as the rocket ignited.
   If post-test analysis turns up no serious problems, the
experiment will qualify the rocket for cold-weather launches,
although further testing on a smaller scale is planned, said Allan
McDonald, vice president of engineering for space operations.
   Identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flights
in the four months since America's return to manned space flight.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ordered Morton
Thiokol to redesign the booster after a Jan. 28, 1986, explosion
destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its seven astronauts.
   NASA required only five qualifying tests before the shuttle
program resumed with the launch of Discovery on Sept. 29. The
shuttle Atlantis was sent into space Dec. 2, and in both cases the
boosters performed with no problems.
   A presidential commission blamed the Challenger disaster on a
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through
an O-ring, triggering the explosion of the craft's liquid fuel tank.
   Investigators also found that freezing temperatures the night
before the launch stiffened the joint's rubber-like O-ring seal,
causing it to lose pliability and contributing to the failure.

   Nets, firecrackers and recordings of killer whales
haven't stopped sea lions from gobbling trout and salmon swimming
through a ship canal, so wildlife officials are going to send the
overeaters into exile.
   This year's run of steelhead, a seagoing rainbow trout that
returns to fresh water to spawn, was about 1,650 at a fish ladder
that lets fish bypass a set of locks, down from about 2,600 last
year, officials said this week.
   Seven to nine California sea lions ``hanging around'' the locks
are gulping an average of 14 fish a day each, said Bob Byrne, state
Wildlife Department spokesman.
   Despite a net barrier erected last year, the 300- to 800-pound
animals ate 53 percent of the run, Byrne said. Sea lions eat 5
percent of their body weight daily, said Susan Ewing, a department
spokeswoman.
   The new plan calls for installing a cage near the mouth of Salmon
Bay below the locks on the Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle's
Ballard section, said Tag Gornall, a Marine Animal Resource Center
veterinarian.
   The cage of five-sixteenths-inch steel mesh will be mounted on a
buoy that was a favorite sea lion resting place and will have a trap
door that can be closed by rope from a nearby boat, said Bob DeLong
of the National Marine Fisheries Service mammals laboratory.
   Sea lions heading for their usual easy pickings in the pool below
the fish ladder at the locks will be trapped, tagged with radio
collars and trucked about 200 miles to the Long Beach Peninsula,
just north of the mouth of the Columbia River, and released on the
coast.
   Long Beach Peninsula was chosen ``because you can't extradite
them,'' Gornall said, ``and besides California and Oregon have
enough of their own sea lions and don't want any more.''
   Asked about the difficulty of moving one of the animals, DeLong
said it could be about the same as moving a ``leather bag filled
with 600 pounds of rocks.''
   DeLong said he expects the sea lions will be back for more fish,
perhaps as soon as five days after they are removed. He said the
animals migrate from their Baja California breeding grounds every
year and they know the route.
   ``I reckon they'll know where they are when we put them off the
Pacific coast,'' he said.
   The operation will begin as soon as the cage is completed, said
Ms. Ewing.
   The feasting sea lions have been the bane of fishermen and others
concerned about the salmon run but have delighted residents and
tourists who flock to the locks to watch the spectacle and applaud
the frolicking animals.
   The sea lions have become a problem at the locks only in the last
couple of years. Scientists have said sea-lion populations have been
growing since federal legislation protecting marine mammals took
effect several years ago.
   Only one or two sea lions feasted outside the Lake Washington
Ship Canal in 1984, but others caught on quickly, Wildlife
Department spokeswoman Susan Ewing said.
   ``They kind of see their buddies over there. Since 1984 that one
or two has grown to the neighborhood of 20 problem animals,'' she
said.
   Along with firecracker noisemakers and recordings of sea lion
predators such as killer whales, offerings of dead fish injected
with a sickening substance failed as deterrents. Rubber bullets have
been rejected _ for now.
   ``We must exhaust all other viable options before we even
consider shooting the sea lions _ the last option,'' Gornall said.
``We're trying to save and manage the fishery and the animals.''

   Former President Reagan and his wife say there
are no movie parts in his future, but they both plan to keep busy in
the home state that Reagan says is not so much a place as a way of
life.
   ``I don't even use the word retirement,'' Reagan told reporters
aboard the Air Force plane that flew him here Friday after the
inauguration of President Bush.
   The former president and first lady came back toward the
reporters' seats early in their flight West and answered questions
for about 20 minutes.
   When the plane arrived at Los Angeles International Airport, the
Reagans were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd and then driven to
their new home in the fashionable Bel Air neighborhood by motorcade.
   Their spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said they planned a private
weekend and no announcements would be made about their activities.
   ``We're just moving into a new house,'' said Reagan. ``We didn't
get the job done over the holidays when we were there.''
   The Reagans slept a total of nine nights in the home around
Christmas and just after New Year's Day.
   ``Obviously, we have to unpack,'' said Mrs. Reagan.
   Reagan, a movie actor before he entered politics, was asked if he
couldn't be tempted to re-enter films, even in a cameo part.
   ``No, there is kind of a lingering feeling that would look a
little bit like trying to cash in on this job that I've had,'' he
said.
   But, a reporter asked, aside from making money, wouldn't it be
appropriate to go back to what he did before politics?
   ``Well ...'' said the former president.
   ``You don't go back,'' said his wife.
   ``No,'' he agreed.
   Reagan said he plans to write a book and to speak out on behalf
of such causes as a presidential line-item veto, a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution and repeal of the two-term limit for
presidents.
   Mrs. Reagan said she doesn't believe in retirement either and
plans to finish a book she is writing and work on behalf of a drug
abuse treatment center she is backing in the Los Angeles area.
   Reagan, who had changed to a blue Air Force jacket with his name
on the pocket after boarding the plane, told reporters he was
prepared to hand over power to Bush. ``For a long time I had to
accept this day and know it was coming,'' he said.
   Returning to California, he said, ``will be a return to a life we
did love very much. California isn't a place in my mind, it's a way
of life, so that is the sweet part of the bittersweet experience.''
   There was just one more thing, Mrs. Reagan said, that the Reagans
wanted to clear up.
   ``He never took naps,'' she said, bringing the subject up
herself. ``No, in eight years, he never took a nap.''
   ``She sometimes gets edgy because she thinks I should be able to
take a nap,'' the former president said.
   At the airport Reagan told the crowd it had been ``a bittersweet
several hours this day'' and added, ``I have to warn you, when you
have to stay eight years away from California excerpt for an
occasional visit, you live in a perpetual state of homesickness.''
   Reagan spent 458 days in California during his eight years as
president. By contrast, his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, spent 77 days
in his native Georgia during his one four-year term.

   Protesters rebuked President Bush on his
Inauguration Day by twisting his oft-mentioned ``thousand points of
light'' into their own ``thousand lights for women's rights'' and
``1,000 sparks of dissent.''
   Nearly 1,000 National Organization for Women demonstrators strewn
through the inaugural parade crowd of 300,000 wore buttons Friday
that lighted up to read, ``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   ``George Bush can't get to the White House without knowing there
are a lot of us who feel very strongly about our constitutional
rights,'' said NOW President Molly Yard.
   In a separate demonstration, four Washington women _ three
wearing rubber masks of Ronald and Nancy Reagan and George Bush _
marched along the Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk wearing signs
protesting the extravagance of the inauguration and contrasting it
to the nation's need to address problems of the homeless, AIDS and
other social issues.
   ``This is pretty much like a coronation in a monarchy,'' said Amy
Barehr. ``The only difference is George Bush isn't Ronald Reagan's
son.''
   As the Bushes moved by in their car, other protesters shook their
fists and jeered, but were virtually drowned out by cheers.
   Meanwhile, members of the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a
People's Agenda _ a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the Gray
Panthers to the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador _ distributed thousands of leaflets calling for changes in
administration policies. Their slogan was ``1,000 sparks of
dissent.''
   The coalition called for all people to ``have the right to
adequate food, housing, clothing and quality health care and
education.'' In addition, the coalition called for a clean
environment, the right to safe, legal abortions, and no
discrimination against minority groups or AIDS victims.
   ``We demand a government responsive to the needs of the people
and the planet rather than corporate and military interests,'' the
group said.

   The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is looking for a kind of radar that can spot orbiting
debris as small as a dime which someday could pose a hazard to its
planned space station.
   The space agency has access to space debris reports from the Air
Force, but it says information is still ``extremely limited about
the number and size of small debris pieces at the operational
altitude range of the space station.''
   The station will operate 180 to 360 miles above Earth.
   NASA needs radar that can see debris as small as one centimeter
in diameter, compared with the 10-centimeter capability of current
systems. The new equipment also would need to calculate the altitude
of the objects.
   A request issued this week for proposals specifies that the new
system must be available by October 1991. The space station, named
Freedom, is scheduled to be in orbit in 1996.
   As of Jan. 11, the Air Force was tracking 7,087 pieces of space
junk, 3,142 put into orbit by the United States and 3,302 left
behind by Soviet spacecraft.
   Space junk has included items such as screws 1@8-inch in
diameter missing after a 1984 space shuttle mission, a thermal glove
that floated out of Gemini 4 in 1965, and a screwdriver dropped by a
spacewalking astronaut aboard the Soviet Mir space station.
   ``Even the smallest pieces of orbital debris pose a potential
hazard'' to the space station, NASA said. ``It is important that the
pressurized modules of Freedom be built to withstand as much orbital
debris damage as possible.''
   The station is planned to remain in Earth orbit for up to 30
years.

<TEXT>
   President Bush led his inaugural parade of
floats, bands and military marchers up Pennsylvania Avenue, walking
for a time under bright sunshine along the route to the White House
he now calls home.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, emerged three times from their
armor-plated limousine to walk along parts of the parade route from
the Capitol to the mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue where they
have a four-year lease.
   At one point, the first lady left her husband's side and rushed
over to kiss television weatherman Willard Scott, who was
broadcasting from the sidelines.
   The Bushes, followed by Vice President Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, and the Quayle's children, walked the final leg of the
1.6-mile parade route past the U.S. Treasury and into the
presidential reviewing stand outside the White House.
   For nearly three hours, the president and his new vice-president
sat with their families, Cabinet officers, Supreme Court justices
and other guests to review floats, bands, dance troupes and
equestrian teams representing all 50 states.
   Darkness fell and bone-chilling cold set in before some 12,000
marchers, 70 floats and 457 horses had filed past the presidential
reviewing stand. Most of the people who paid $100 a seat in
bleachers nearest the White House had left long before the parade
ended.
   For the finale, Bush and his guests stood to sing ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic'' with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which
arrived on a white float bearing the slogan ``Peace, Prosperity and
Independence.''
   ``It's a grand day sir, and it's a grand old flag,'' conductor
Jerold Ottley told Bush, whereupon choir members, sporting yellow
plaid scarves, broke into a spirited version of ``It's a Grand Old
Flag.''
   Like any firemen's parade in towns across America, Bush's
inaugural procession had a stream of high school bands, flags, baton
twirlers and antique cars.
   But unlike most local parades, this one also had the Ohio State
Marching Band, the Budweiser Clydesdales and the ``President's Own''
Marine Corps Band all in the same line.
   The two grand marshals, comedian Bob Hope and test pilot Chuck
Yeager, rode to the White House on the lead ``Flag Float'' and
joined the Bushes in the front row of the reviewing stand.
   The president's son, George Bush Jr., donned a white ten-gallon
hat when the Texas float, followed by the University of Texas
Longhorn Band, arrived on the scene.
   The line of march also included a band from Yale, the president's
alma mater, and another from DePauw University, the Indiana college
that Quayle attended.
   Mrs. Quayle's alma mater, Purdue, was represented by a marching
band that boasted ``the world's largest drum.''
   An obviously delighted president stood up and waved as a Navy TBM
Avenger torpedo bomber, a duplicate of the plane he piloted during
World War II, went by on a float.
   Bush and Quayle shared a joke as the Boston Patrolmen's
Association, Inc., the first police union to endorse the GOP
presidential ticket last fall, filed by along with a large float
representing Boston's finest.
   The endorsement was particularly embarrassing for Michael
Dukakis, Bush's Democratic challenger from Massachusetts.
   During the parade, Bush dangled grandchildren on his knee,
greeted Cabinet officers and chatted with his children. Across the
aisle, the Quayles sat alone, speaking only infrequently with the
Bushes or others on the platform.
   Arriving on the platform, Mrs. Quayle greeted Bush with a kiss,
then quickly froze to attention after noticing that a color guard
was passing by.
   Each time a flag appeared, Mrs. Quayle stood up and placed her
hand over her heart.

Bush</HEAD>

   Democratic lawmakers welcomed George Bush's
inaugural speech as a sign that the new Republican president will
have better relations with Congress than Ronald Reagan did, but they
also said it offered too few specifics.
   ``I think we're off on a good foot,'' said Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich. ``This has genuinely established a kind of bipartisanship
and friendship that should go beyond inaugural speeches.''
   ``I've been very touched by the things he's said in the last
several days,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``It's better than what
we've had in the past eight years.''
   ``It was a very sensitive speech,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan. ``In style, it's a dramatic break from Ronald Reagan. It was
humane, and it showed a recognition that the Democrats control both
houses of Congress.''
   He said Bush's suggestion in his 20-minute address that the
federal government's money needs be reallocated clearly implied a
shift from Reagan's emphasis on military spending to domestic
priorities.
   ``He repeated the themes he's been stating since the election:
cooperation and conciliation,'' said House Majority Leader Thomas
Foley, D-Wash. ``It is all very well received, and Congress will
respond with an equal effort and attitude.''
   ``Bush is extending the hand of friendship, and we intend to
extend ours in return,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Mitchell said he planned to make a speech in response on
Wednesday, when the Senate reconvenes, ``setting forth some of our
objectives for this Congress.'' He said he had discussed his plans
for the response with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Dole said the speech represented ``a good start,'' but added:
``Now the hard part comes _ doing all these things the president
wants to do.''
   Former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, D-Mass., also welcomed
the change. ``It's the dawn of a new era,'' he said. ``We're back to
normalcy in the White House. How delighted I am.''
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., praised Bush's address and
predicted he will be a different type of president than Reagan.
   ``He remembered the real problems, like the deficit and drugs,''
Hollings said. ``George Bush, you can tell by the way he talks, will
be a hands-on president. Rather than trying to dismantle the
bureaucracy, he'll try to make it work.''
   Some lawmakers said that while they welcomed Bush's heavy
emphasis on volunteerism to meet the country's social needs, they
were concerned that it might indicate an intent not to put federal
money into programs like housing and welfare.
   ``I just don't understand how he's going to have America be more
generous and not spend any more money on the people who need help,''
said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y. ``Be happy, don't worry _ that's
what we heard today.''

   A fireball that blazed across the night skies of the central
United States on Friday was a Soviet rocket body launched in
December and re-entering the atmosphere, authorities said.
   The rocket was sighted in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi and Iowa, and a number of
witnesses called officials to say they had seen it blaze across the
sky about 8:10 p.m. CST.
   Some witnesses said the fireball had fiery tail 30 to 40 miles
long.
   Maj. Dick Adams, a spokesman for the North American Air Defense
Command in Colorado Springs, Colo., said the U.S. Space Command
identified the object as a Soviet-built rocket body that was
launched sometime last year.
   ``It came down about 9 p.m. EST,'' Adams said. ``There is no way
to know as to what happened to it.''
   The space command tracks about 7,100 manmade objects and once
they start to notice an object falling out of orbit they try to
predict its re-entry, Adams said.
   Adams said the object would not be positively identified until
Saturday.
   Earlier in the evening, before the rocket body was tentatively
identified, Navy Cmdr. Dugald Gillies, deputy director of public
affairs for the U.S. Space Command, said the Space Surveillance
Center was monitoring the object.
   ``We've gotten many calls as well,'' Gillies said. ``To the best
of our estimation, it would be a re-entering of a Soviet rocket body
from a launch that took place last year.
   ``(That's) as much detail as we have. (It was) one of the objects
that we track. This re-entry correlates with what we were tracking.''
   He said the sightings were made better because of weather that
was clear and perfect for such sightings.
   A dispatcher at the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the office had
received calls from ``all over the state.'' ``Altus, Enid, Pawnee,
Muskogee ... you name it, they've seen it,'' she said. ``We're not
sure yet what it was.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration, National Weather Service and
military bureaus and bases across the midwest and southwest were
swamped with calls from the curious, officials said.
   ``It just appeared all of a sudden out of the south and fell
straight due north and it left a line just as straight as could
be,'' Robin England of Abilene, Texas, told the Abilene
Reporter-News.
   Ms. England said the rocket was in the sky for about three
minutes, slowly streaking across the sky.
   Sgt. Ron Lenzini of the Macon, Mo., division of the Missouri
State Highway Patrol, said the display was spectacular.
   ``I went to the front door about 8:10 p.m. and saw what looked
like a cluster of five pieces of some kind of burning debris in the
sky,'' Lenzini said.
   ``It had the effect of Fourth of July, or Roman candles trailing
fire behind it,'' he said.

   Condemned killer Ted Bundy began confessing
to the murders of about 30 young women in five Western states, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Volusia State Attorney John Tanner, a personal friend of Bundy,
told The Orlando Sentinel Friday night that he learned of the
confessions from law enforcement agents at Florida State Prison near
Starke.
   ``It's my information that murders are being solved,'' Tanner
said. ``This is coming from law enforcement officers who are
participating in these meetings. The information they are giving me
is that he is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved
murders.''
   Tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him, but said
Bundy met Friday with Robert Keppel of the Washington state attorney
general's office, and Bill Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Sciences
Unit in Quantico, Va.
   Bundy, who faces execution Tuesday in the slaying of a
12-year-old Lake City girl, is scheduled to meet this weekend with
authorities from Colorado, Utah and Idaho.
   Tanner and his wife met with the killer for about two hours
Friday morning before the law enforcement meetings began.
   Police have mentioned Bundy as a suspect in as many as three
dozen slayings in the early and mid-1970s in Washington state,
Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Colorado. The victims were young women
between the ages of 16 and 26. Many were never found.
   Bundy has frequently met with investigators and reporters over
the past 11 years, but has refused to talk specifically about any of
the cases.
   Bundy, facing the electric chair for the 1978 murder of Kimberly
Leach, has tried to trade information about the unsolved murders for
a delay in his execution, but Gov. Bob Martinez rejected the offer.
   Tanner has been meeting regularly with Bundy for about two years.
He said the killer told him about a year ago that he wanted to
confess to everything he'd done.
   Tanner, a defense attorney before being elected in November, said
they specifically did not discuss details of any of the cases
because he is a lawyer.
   ``I know people won't necessarily accept this, but (Bundy) says
it's the right thing to do,'' the attorney said. ``People think he's
just trying to buy time.''

   Condemned murderer Ted Bundy began
confessing to the murders of about 30 young women in five Western
states Friday, a newspaper reported, and the Florida Supreme refused
to block his execution.
   The 42-year-old former law student is slated to die in the
electric chair Tuesday for the murder of a 12-year-old Lake City
girl.
   Volusia State Attorney John Tanner, a personal friend of Bundy,
told The Orlando Sentinel Friday night that he learned of the
confessions from law enforcement agents at Florida State Prison near
Starke, the newspaper said Saturday.
   ``It's my information that murders are being solved,'' Tanner
said. ``This is coming from law enforcement officers who are
participating in these meetings. The information they are giving me
is that he is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved
murders.''
   Tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him, but said
Bundy met with Robert Keppel of the Washington state attorney
general's office, and Bill Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Sciences
Unit in Quantico, Va.
   Bundy is scheduled to meet this weekend with authorities from
Colorado, Utah and Idaho.
   The Supreme Court, meanwhile, said it didn't want to hear from
Bundy again.
   Defense attorney James Coleman was expected to take his appeal to
U.S. District Court in Orlando for a hearing on Saturday morning.
   The high court rejected three claims from Bundy and said his
attempt to again raise the issue of mental competency constituted an
abuse of process.
   The Supreme Court said the issue had not been raised in a timely
fashion, should have been raised at an earlier stage and had already
been settled in an case in which Bundy was convicted of murdering
two sorority sisters.
   The court also said no petition for rehearing will be permitted.
   ``The question really was, was he able to assist his lawyers?''
said Coleman, who sought to stop the execution to determine whether
Bundy was competent during his trial for the murder of Kimberly
Diane Leach, a Lake City schoolgirl.
   Bundy served as his own attorney through much of that trial.
   ``Much of what he did, even at the hearing, undermined his
defense and his lawyers were having problems controlling him,
getting him to make decisions, having problems getting him to stick
to decisions,'' said Coleman.
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth said after the hearing that
Bundy's attorneys were ``grasping at a straw.''
   ``All the courts have found Ted Bundy to be competent,'' said
Butterworth.
   The appeal centered on allegations that Bundy's competence to
stand trial wasn't adequately reviewed in either the Leach case or
an earlier conviction in the 1978 slayings of sorority sisters at
Florida State University.
   They also claimed the judge at the Leach trial improperly
discussed the case with prosecutors without defense attorneys
present.
   Those claims were rejected by the Supreme Court, which said they
were not raised in timely fashion in accordance with rules of
procedure.
   Bundy is under his fourth death warrant. Gov. Bob Martinez signed
the most recent warrant Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to hear the case.
   Bundy's last stay of execution was in 1986, six hours before he
was to go to the electric chair.

   A homeless man ``cold-bloodedly'' chased
and shot two policemen to death Friday before he was killed by other
officers in a noontime gun battle recorded by a student television
crew.
   The man, a transient, grabbed the gun of an officer questioning
him outside a doughnut shop, then chased the officer and opened
fire, wounding him and then fatally shooting him in the head, police
and witnesses said.
   The homeless man then mortally wounded a second officer before
other police officers arrived and killed him in a fusillade of
pistol and shotgun fire, witnesses and police officials reported.
   Police said there were 30 witnesses to the incident, which was at
least partly recorded by a student television crew from Santa Clara
University that was making a film about the homeless across the
street from the shooting.
   The videotape they shot is jumpy and incomplete, but apparently
shows the transient firing at the wounded officers, then running
across the street while still holding the gun. A moment later, he is
shown lying in the street.
   The second officer died about six hours after the shooting, after
undergoing three hours of surgery at the San Jose Medical Center,
doctors said.
   Coroners officials in this city, about 40 miles south of San
Francisco, withheld the officers' names until their families could
be notified.
   Will Douglas of Los Angeles was driving through the area when he
saw a man pointing a gun at the officer.
   ``He began pursuing the officer. The officer hit the ground. He
(the transient) cold-bloodedly pursued him,'' said Douglas. ``I saw
the officer disappear behind a truck. I saw the man lower his gun
and shoot.''
   The 3{-minute audio track of the tape carries the sound of 26
shots, 21 of them during the final 30-second volley that killed the
transient.
   The shooting came three days after another drifter, Patrick
Purdy, opened fire in an elementary school playground in Stockton,
80 miles to the east, killing five children and wounded 30 other
people before taking his own life.

   Fires set by inmates erupted Friday night in a
prison south of Washington and authorities said an unknown number of
inmates were free within the sprawling complex. One inmate was
killed and one was injured, authorities said.
   At least four fires were set in the Lorton Reformatory complex,
according to authorities. The administration building of the central
facility was destroyed by the flames, according to officials at the
mayor's command center.
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, accompanied by his wife
Effi, both dressed in formal clothes they wore to Friday night's
inaugural balls, arrived early today for a briefing.
   The fires were at the corrections complex, which is operated by
the district and located about 20 miles south of the city. The
medium-security complex houses about 1,280 inmates from the district
in dormitories and has been the scene of numerous inmate protests
because of overcrowded conditions.
   Pat Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the city corrections department,
said one inmate was killed in the outbreak and another was injured.
No details about the circumstances of those casualties were
immediately available.
   Ms. Wheeler said all inmates had been accounted for and none had
escaped from the complex.
   Firefighters remained outside for about an hour while city
corrections officers herded inmates who had been loose in the
complex onto a baseball field.
   Lt. Mike Reilly of the Fairfax County, Va., Fire Department, said
firemen did not try to put out the fires until it was certain the
situation was safe. ``Until we get an area that is confirmed secure,
we are keeping our firefighters out,'' he said.
   It was not clear how many buildings were on fire in the sprawling
complex, which sits in a wooded, rolling area near the Potomac
River. One official said four buildings had fires, but there were
other reports that only two buildings were aflame.
   Washington police were rushed to the area, including officers who
had been assigned to protection duties at inaugural balls around the
city. The galas were celebrating the inauguration of President Bush
earlier Friday.
   The fire did not disrupt Bush's schedule as he made the rounds of
inaugural events, but six police cars, their sirens wailing, sped by
on their way to the prison just as the president's motorcade pulled
up to a private dinner at the Organization of American States
building near the White House.
   The incident began with a power failure about 9:15 p.m. at the
prison's central facility.
   With the lights out, fires were set by inmates in the building,
said Ms. Wheeler.
   ``We have no idea what specifically is going on inside'' the
central facility, she said in answer to a question about the
location of inmates.
   Inmates were herded into a nearby baseball field where they were
being guarded by police, Ms. Wheeler said.
   The fires continued to burn several hours after the first alarm
was sounded.
   Early today, D.C. fire units arrived to aid Fairfax firefighters.
   FBI agents also went to the prison, said Ms. Wheeler. The FBI
investigates crimes at the complex.
   A district police helicopter hovered overhead and some inmates
were running loose in an open area within the prison complex.
   The chronically overcrowded prison complex, made up of a series
of smaller prisons, held a total of 6,165 inmates last month, when
the district government asked a federal judge to bar newly sentenced
felons from the entering city institutions.
   The city closed its doors to new inmates for six weeks last fall,
opening them again only under a federal judge's order. The federal
government was forced to take charge of 300 city inmates during that
time.
   The district has also sent more than 200 inmates to the states of
Washington and Tennessee.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., responding to the violence and frequent
escapes from the facility, introduced legislation in Congress last
fall to give Virginia some control over the prison complex. At the
time, he said, ``The situation at Lorton reached crisis proportions
a decade ago, and it has continued to deteriorate.''
   Although there have been isolated incidents at the complex,
Friday night's outbreak was the largest since an inmate riot broke
out in July, 1986 at the Occoquan I and II facilities, two sections
within the Lorton institution. One inmate was killed by buckshot
wounds to the head suffered when guards tried to quell the uprising.
   Twenty-nine inmates, nine guards and three firefighters were
injured in that riot. The fiery outbreak damaged 13 buildings and
many inmates were kept in temporary shelters for a time afterwards.
   Edward Koren, an attorney with the National Prison Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said, ``This is not
anything new, we have a long, sad history of overcrowding at these
facilities. Inevitably, there are disturbances.''
   ``It's really a very dangerous place. They claim it is medium
security, but really its used for long timers. It's really just a
dormitory. There's a lot of violence, a lot of idlness, conditions
are poor, and that's a real dangerous mix.''
   The district has been unable to build new facilities at the
complex because of political opposition from Fairfax County
officials, who oppose the presence of the district prison and hold
more power than the city in Congress.

   President Bush called himself ``a lousy
dancer'' but gamely took a few whirls with his wife during an
exultant tour of inaugural balls where 60,000 Republican stalwarts
toasted his swearing-in and caroused into the wee hours today.
   During the gaudy, noisy and slightly wacky evening, Bush also
bragged about his ``fantastic'' new living quarters at the White
House and Vice President Dan Quayle had one hotel ballroom throng
erupting in laughter with an offhand remark with a double meaning.
   Bush's choice for secretary of state, James A. Baker III,
sashayed with fellow Texans beneath the Wright brothers' plane at
the National Air and Space Museum, where Crystal Gayle sang her
country best.
   It was so crowded and the air so heavy in the red-carpeted grand
foyer of the Kennedy Center that several black-tie guests fainted in
front of the stage. One woman who lost consciousness was kept from
sagging to the floor by the crush of more than 5,000 people around
her.
   Presidential son Marvin Bush introduced his wife, who wore a
full-length blue velvet gown, and told several thousand partygoers
at the Washington Convention Center: ``I paid a lot for this dress
and, damn it, I wanted you to see it.''
   One of the belles of the ball at another hotel was 7-year-old
Jessica Cartonia, the current Little Miss Buffalo. Her mother,
Sharon, proudly confided that Jessica was conceived in the same
hotel during President Reagan's first inauguration in 1981, when
``we thought we were never going to have children.''
   Outside one of the 11 invitation-only inaugural balls, animal
rights protesters shouted ``Fur is Murder'' and ``I'm Warm _ I'm Not
Wearing Fur'' at arriving guests, many of whom wore fur coats in the
chill wind.
   The bass player for the Bus Boys rock band at a $30-a-head youth
ball stood up and shouted: ``It's the inaugural day for a brand-new,
get-down president.''
   During his hurried ball-hopping tour from Union Station near the
Capitol to the Kennedy Center on the banks of the moonlit Potomac
River, the new president made it laughingly clear that he's not very
fond of dancing.
   Each time the band struck up ``I Could Have Danced All Night,''
Bush took his wife, Barbara, out for a brief cheek-to-cheek turn on
the floor. He took a few steps of an old-fashioned fox trot _ and no
more.
   He told the crowd at Union Station that ``you can say that you
saw it first here: a lousy dancer trying to dance his first dance
with the first lady of the United States of America.''
   Later, at the sprawling Pension Building, he quipped, ``The Bush
family is going to give dancing a bad name.'' After taking a few
steps with Mrs. Bush, he stopped abruptly and announced: ``That's
it. That's the only step I know.''
   At the Washington Convention Center, which rocked to the music of
his old friend Lionel Hampton, the president pleaded with the crowd
to overlook his footwork. ``I hope you don't judge my being a
president by the way I dance,'' he said.
   Quayle told revelers at a hotel ballroom that he feels the same
way about dancing as his new boss. ``I guess protocol allows you to
witness my inability to dance,'' he said, taking his wife, Marilyn,
onto the floor for a few stiff turns.
   At another hotel, Quayle appeared with his wife and, recalling
their departure from the oath-taking ceremony at the Capitol,
remarked that ``we went behind the Bushes.'' The crowd erupted in
laughter at the double-entendre.
   ``Johnny Carson could not do it better,'' the vice president said
with a grin.
   Bush seemed elated by his new home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   ``Don't worry about our housing,'' he told one ballroom assembly.
``We were over at the White House for two hours and, boy, is it
something special. Unbelievable.''
   At his first stop, an American Legion affair for 149 Medal of
Honor winners and other military heroes, the president vowed to keep
America strong. By the time he reached the Omni Shoreham for his
12th visit, Bush's energy was flagging.
   ``Where do you get all that life from?'' he asked the cheering
throng.
   At his 15th and final stop on the party circuit, standing in the
Washington Hilton Hotel ballroom at 12:30 a.m., a hoarse Bush seemed
in a reflective mood as he recalled his emotions when he took the
oath of office at the West Front of the Capitol at midday Friday.
   ``I did feel moved standing there today and looking across that
sea of faces,'' he said, ``thinking of the continuity of the
presidency, thinking of my gratitude to my predecessor, thinking of
the joy that I have and the strength that I get from my family,
thinking of how lucky we are to be a nation under God and thinking
how lucky I am to have friends like you.''
   With that, he departed in his limousine. Fifteen minutes later,
he arrived home for his first night in the White House.

   World leaders showered President Bush with
congratulations as he took office, with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev hoping he would bring peace and Pope John Paul II wishing
him ``an abundance of divine blessings.''
   The leftist Nicaraguan government extended an olive branch and
Arab leaders were optimistic that Bush would move the United States
from former President Reagan's staunch pro-Israeli position in the
Middle East.
   One European newspaper hailed the return of pragmatists to the
U.S. government and another ``the down-to-earth Bush'' over ``Reagan
the romantic.'' A British daily said Bush would need some of
Reagan's luck.
   While the sendoffs for Reagan were mostly warm, about 5,000
Panamanians shot off fireworks in Panama City and Nicaraguans danced
in the streets of Managua to celebrate his departure.
   Gorbachev told Bush he hoped his term would bring ``stable and
diverse development of relations between our countries,'' and said
Moscow was ready to work in that direction, the official news agency
Tass said.
   Gorbachev said, ``Further joint efforts by the Soviet Union and
the United States will make it possible to substantially bring
closer the solution of the most painful problems of the present
time, above all, the need to eliminate the threat of war.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent Bush a congratulatory
message, as did West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President
Francois Mitterrand of France and other European leaders. In Vatican
City, the pope, leader of the world's Roman Catholics, wished Bush
and the United States ``an abundance of divine blessings.''
   Also among the well-wishers were King Juan Carlos of Spain and
presidents Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Jose Sarney of Brazil and
Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico.
   Panamanians, led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, celebrated
Reagan's departure by shooting off fireworks and dancing to bands in
a plaza on Panama City's main thoroughfare. Noriega denies U.S. drug
charges against him and has outlasted U.S. efforts to force him to
quit as the nation's de facto leader.
   In Managua, Sandinistas celebrated the end of the Reagan era with
dancing in the streets and parades that mocked him. Reagan's
administration has financed the anti-government Contra rebels since
1981. One float Friday showed Uncle Sam throwing dollars and the
local opposition picking them up.
   However, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, saying he was
optimistic U.S.-Nicaraguan ``relations will improve'' under Bush,
announced that it would begin issuing visas for U.S. officials.
   Nicaragua imposed visa restrictions after each country expelled
eight of the other's diplomats, including the ambassadors, during a
diplomatic tiff in July.
   In the Middle East, Israeli and Arab commentators appeared to
agree that the changeover from Reagan to Bush was Israel's loss and
the Arabs' gain.
   In Jeruslaem, the daily Hadashot said Israel must be prepared for
Bush ``to be less sensitive and more pragmatic in approaching the
(Arab-Israel) conflict.''
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he believed Bush
``understands the Palestinian problem and has good intentions,''
according to an interview with the Kuwait daily Al-Rai Al-Aam.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for PLO chief Yasser Arafat, and
other officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization expressed
cautious optimism that their cause may fare better with Bush.
   ``The pros are back,'' said the conservative La Libre Belgique in
Brussels, but added they were ``a network of serious patricians who
risk being boring.''
   In Paris, the leftist newspaper Le Monde asked: ``After `the
Great Communicator,' `the Great Corrector?'''
   Bush's ``big challenge will be peace, of which Mr. Gorbachev made
himself the champion,'' the paper said.
   The center-left Het Parool of Amsterdam said Bush's presidency
will be less flamboyant than that of Reagan. ``But better than
Reagan the romantic, the down-to-earth Bush may be expected to draw
the line between dream and reality. And that holds no small
promise.''
   The Financial Times anticipated ``a preference for management and
a recognition of interdependence,'' but added Bush would need luck _
``a commodity that Mr. Reagan had in abundance but cannot bequeath.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle danced gamely into
his second day on the job, partying with wife Marilyn until well
past midnight and facing down a heckler in the only moment of
discord on a night of celebration.
   The Quayles stopped at 14 inaugural balls and parties over more
than four and a half hours Friday night after being sworn in as the
44th vice president. It was after 1 a.m. before they headed to the
vice president's residence for their first night's sleep in their
new home.
   At the American Legion's ``Salute to Heroes' Banquet,'' Quayle
was interrupted by a shout from the audience just as he was speaking
of freedom as ``the most precious thing we have.''
   ``What do you know about it?'' shouted a woman who appeared to be
a guest but could not be identified.
   Pausing only briefly, Quayle said: ``Freedom, people have the
freedom to speak. We have free speech in this country.''
   He received a long and loud applause from the crowd made up
largely of war veterans, including 149 of the 225 living recipients
of the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military
honor.
   Quayle savored the sound of his new title at several stops. After
praising Bush at length, he said, ``As a matter of fact, Vice
President Dan Quayle doesn't sound too shabby.''
   Quayle danced with his wife briefly at each of the balls on their
motorcade tour of the city. He told reporters before stepping out
for the evening that his wife says he is a ``terrible dancer,'' and
he pledged ``to keep it to a minimum.''
   He did little to dispel that judgment, and the dances were brief.
   At the lavish ball in newly restored Union Station he danced with
his mother, and at several other stops he and Marilyn danced with
guests selected from the audience _ after first dancing with each
other.
   But as the night wore on both appeared weary, and by midnight he
had lost track of how many parties they had been to.
   ``Ask the press,'' said Marilyn Quayle. He did.
   ``The press says it's the 11th ball,'' the vice president
announced. ``They're usually wrong _ so for the record, it's either
10 or 12.''
   He won more applause.
   At a stop at the youth inaugural ball, the 41-year-old Quayle was
greeted warmly. One woman on the front row, 24-year-old Cindy Butler
of Atlanta, yelled to him, ``Dan, blow me a kiss,'' and, ``Take your
coat off, Dan.''
   At another stop he told of his unease at the new protocol that
put him ahead of former President Reagan upon leaving the inaugural
ceremony. He said he and Marilyn ``went out behind the Bushes,'' and
then paused to consider what he'd said.
   Mrs. Quayle put her hand to her face in embarrassment.
   The crowd roared.
   ``Johnny Carson could do no better,'' Quayle said finally.
   With that, it was time to dance.

   Oil union bosses Joaquin Hernandez Galicia and
Salvador Barragan Camacho have been kicked out of the Mexican
Workers Federation in the wake of their arrests in a government
crackdown, the official news service Notimex said.
   The federation cleared their belongings out of their offices at
the union headquarters Friday on the orders of Mexico's top labor
leader, Fidel Velazquez, Notimex said. Their offices are to be
occupied by meat union leaders.
   Hernandez Galicia and Barragan Camacho were among 46 people
arrested in a Jan. 10 crackdown on oil union leaders.
   Hernandez Galicia, 66, was arrested after soldiers and federal
agents raided his home in Ciudad Madero. A federal agent was shot to
death in the attack.
   The federal Attorney General's office reported it found 200 Uzi
machine guns, believed to have been smuggled in from the United
States, in the Hernandez Galicia home in the northeastern state of
Tamaulipas.
   Hernandez Galicia, also known as La Quina, is in a Mexico City
jail on weapons and homicide charges.
   Barragan Camacho is under arrest in a Mexico City hospital, where
he was taken with heart troubles the day of the arrests.

   A touch of the flu forced Johnny Carson to
cancel his appearance on ``The Tonight Show,'' sending several
hundred audience members home when no substitute host could be found.
   ``We hoped to get Jay Leno as a replacement, but he had an
engagement in Nevada,'' show spokesman Charles Barrett said Friday.
   He said Carson rarely misses a taping, adding that Carson's last
sick day came about two years ago.
   Scheduled guests for Friday's show included actor Tom Selleck and
singer Emmylou Harris. NBC televised a rerun of the show.

   ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson did it one last
time. As Ronald Reagan headed for the plane that would carry him off
to California, Donaldson shouted: ``How about a word, Mr. President?
How about a word?''
   As usual, the president just grinned and shrugged.
   When Reagan left the White House on Friday morning, Donaldson
left, too, after 12 years as ABC's chief White House correspondent.
   ``I'm going out with no regrets,'' Donaldson said. ``And it's a
pleasure they're not carrying me out feet first and not pushing me
out, but I'm going of my own will.''
   Brit Hume took over the job as of noon Friday with George Bush's
inauguration. Donaldson is expected to be named co-anchor of a new,
prime-time ABC news program and will continue to appear on ``This
Week with David Brinkley.''
   His habit of shouting questions at Reagan during ``photo
opportunities'' was often cited as an example of an arrogant and
disrespectful news media. But Donaldson maintained he shouted
questions only when there was no other way to get an answer.

   Actresses and pop stars modeled T-shirts to support
a retail venture in the campaign against furs, while a half-dozen
furriers protested outside the shop.
   Actresses Julie Christie, Rita Tushingham and Twiggy, Chrissie
Hynde of The Pretenders and Siouxsie of the group Siouxsie and The
Banshees on Friday donned T-shirts designed by the animal rights
group LYNX.
   The 3-year-old group has opened a store in Covent Garden, making
its case by selling T-shirts bearing slogans like, ``Yuck, Your
Disgusting Fur Coat.''
   ``I modeled a fur coat when I was 16 _ that is the first and last
time I have ever worn one,'' said Twiggy. ``Wearing a fur coat is
absolutely unnecessary, absolutely disgusting, and complete vanity.
We have got to stop women wanting them so there would be no point
selling them.''
   Some of the protesting furriers handed out leaflets with a
distorted LYNX logo which they had embellished with horns and forked
tongue.
   ``LYNX's stated purpose is to destroy the fur trade,'' said
Mihran Allalemdjian, who buys and sells skins. ``There is a question
whether their literature and posters do incite other people to act
in a violent manner.''
   Hynde said she had no sympathy for violence. The fur trade, she
said, ``is an immoral industry but not an illegal one. The only way
to stop it is to boycott the products.''

   Actress Cicely Tyson says blacks have
lost some of the unity they had before the civil rights era
blossomed.
   Tyson, spoke at the University of Tennessee here on Friday in one
of the many events across the country this week in memory of slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Tyson, 55, said the 1960s movement was essential for blacks, but
said ``before the civil rights movement came, people needed each
other and relied on each other to survive. Somehow we have lost
this.''
   The actress, who has spoken out against typecasting blacks as
drug addicts and prostitutes, also said overt racism has given way
to more subtle forms of discrimination.
   Tyson's film credits include ``Sounder,'' for which she received
an Oscar nomination, and ``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.'' She also
received an Emmy nomination for her role in the TV miniseries
``Roots.''

   Poet Edgar Bowers, an English professor
at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has been awarded
Yale University's prestigious Bollingen Prize in Poetry.
   The university announced Friday that Bowers received the award,
which carries a $10,000 prize, in recognition of his entire body of
work.
   Past winners include Wallace Stevens, Archibald MacLeish, William
Carlos Williams, e.e. cummings, Robert Frost, Robert Penn Warren and
Marianne Moore.
   The Bollingen Prize, established in 1949, was awarded annually at
first, but has been bestowed every two years since 1965.
   The judges said Bowers, 64, has ``consistently exhibited a vigor
of image and idea that extends beyond the comparatively small
compass of his collected poems.''
   Bowers' first book, ``A Form of Loss,'' was published in 1956.
His last collection of verse, ``Witnesses,'' was published in 1981.

teaching students to learn by writing research papers rather than
studying textbooks.
   Wang, 48, flew on a 1984 space shuttle mission, then worked at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of
Technology before joining the Vanderbilt faculty last summer to

   ``Students have a tendency to learn from the textbook,'' he said.
``I want them to learn from research.''
   Wang is developing a center for microgravity research.

<HEAD>Iran Institutes Mandatory Death Penalty For Smugglers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tough Iranian crackdown on drug
traffickers takes effect today, with a mandatory death penalty for
anyone found with small amounts of narcotics.
   At least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month in
the fiercest crackdown since the early days of the Islamic
revolution, when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers were
rounded up and killed.
   The new campaign followed the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq
war and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships caused
by the 8-year conflict, worsening unemployment and Iran's religious
ban on alcohol.
   The laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30
grams, or just over an ounce, of heroin, codeine or morphine or
smuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish. Simple possession of opium
or hashish carries a jail term.
   ``We have no fear of increasing statistics on executions because
those who become the victims of the traders of death are far greater
in number than the smugglers,'' said Mohammad-Mousavi Khoeiniha,
Iran's prosecutor-general, on Tehran radio.
   Official figures on drug abuse in Iran are not available. But
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani recently indicated the scale
of the crisis by referring to ``the devastating problem of drug
abuse ... a blight that has ruined some of our young people.''
   ``The problem ... is a political one,'' said Iran's chief
justice, Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili. ``The superpowers, just as they
fought the Islamic revolution on the battlefield and in the economic
field ... use narcotics as one method to battle with the people ...
and taint the revolution.''
   Even before the new law came into force, Iranian authorities had
rounded up more than 1,000 suspected smugglers and pushers, running
them through Islamic tribunals and hanging them as soon as they were
found guilty.
   On Jan. 7, 19 smugglers were hanged or shot by firing squads.
   Tehran's radical Jomhuri Islami daily hailed the executions as
``a landmark on the path to eradicating narcotics.''
   Nine days later, Iran's official media said 56 were executed in
one day in various cities, a chilling display of Tehran's
determination to eliminate drugs.
   Jomhuri Islami urged that authorities ``put an end to the
disgraceful life of a few who take joy in ruining a nation only to
fill their pockets.
   ``It's much better if some families lose their breadwinners in
this way than a nation loses its youth.''
   The new law was announced Dec. 5 by the 13-member Expediency
Council, a body with special powers set up in February by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini to speed legislation snarled in Parliament.
   Apart from the death sentences, the law provides for a minimum
20-year prison term for anyone convicted of addicting another person
to drugs. Those convicted of causing widespread addiction could also
face death.
   The Expediency Council gave drug addicts six months to kick their
habits or face imprisonment.
   Mokhtar Kalantari, deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary
Committees, which have largely taken over law enforcement from
police, acknowledged shortcomings in recent years in combatting the
narcotics trade from neighboring Afghanistan and Pakistan while Iran
concentrated on the war with Iraq. There are extensive poppy fields
in Iran as well.
   Officials say large quantities of narcotics are smuggled through
Iran into Turkey and the Soviet Union.
   Former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, in exile in France,
claimed in a recent New York Times interview that the Tehran
government is involved in the drug trade ``to make ends meet,''
earning $2 billion a year from it.
   Kalantari predicted with the new laws that authorities will
eliminate 80 percent of the narcotics trade within two years.

   Mayor Xavier Suarez unveiled an economic development
plan for poor black neighborhoods in the wake of riots as the city
geared up for the Super Bowl with fanfare, fireworks and fiestas.
   Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, prepared for the funeral
today of one of two black men whose deaths in a police shooting
Monday triggered the riots.
   Suarez discussed the plan in a meeting Friday with black leaders
as the black neighborhoods shaken by three days of violence returned
to normality.
   ``We know that a little bit of anger can have good results, and
we hope to turn what was more than a little bit of anger expressed
in our community into many, many good results,'' he told them.
   The city refused to let one of its worst weeks completely spoil
the prelude to one of its biggest events: the Super Bowl this Sunday.
   Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis performed Friday
night at the Miami Arena on the edge of Overtown, the predominantly
black neighborhood where the riots began. Another performance was
booked for tonight.
   In nearby Miami Beach, 3,000 people attended a bash held by
National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle at the Stephen
Muss Convention Center.
   Fireworks burst over Biscayne Bay as thousands of excited
partiers listened to salsa and jazz bands at a shopping center and
park less than a mile from where the shooting occurred.
   A panel formed to investigate the shooting met for the first time
Friday.
   ``I'm hoping we'll begin to deal seriously with this community's
problems and do more than just put some iodine on its cancers,''
said the Rev. Richard Berry, chairman of the 11-member committee of
police officers and black residents.
   An unarmed motorcyclist, 23-year-old Clement Lloyd, was shot in
the head by a Hispanic policeman Monday as he sped through Overtown.
Lloyd's passenger, Allen Blanchard, died of injuries from the
subsequent crash.
   The rioting that followed left one man dead, and 11 others were
treated for gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were torched, others
were looted and 372 people were arrested in Overtown and the
predominantly black Liberty City neighborhood, authorities said.
   About 150 of those arrested remained in jail, unable to post
bond, said police Sgt. Michael Mazur. Authorities planned to keep
them locked up until new arraignments Monday when, if they plead
guilty, they will released based on time served.
   Blanchard was to be buried this afternoon. Officials said they
were concerned about the potential for trouble at the funeral,
primarily because of the involvement of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who
has led protests by blacks in New York City and in Atlanta.
   ``The major concern is that Sharpton will cause problems,'' said
Mazur. ``We don't need someone pouring gasoline on the situation.''
   Black leaders have said Sharpton is unwelcome, but he was
scheduled to hold a news conference and rally anyway.
   Security concerns also focused on the Super Bowl. Three hundred
Metro-Dade police officers in uniform and plainclothes will guard
Joe Robbie Stadium, said police spokesman Jim Hutton.
   Only people with tickets will be allowed past the parking gates.
If protesters show up and obstruct the entrance, they will be moved
out quickly, Hutton said.
   Suarez called his program ``Miami's comeback plan,'' aimed at
giving an economic boost to black areas and improving
police-community relations.
   The plan includes special tax districts, business and job
creation programs and police sensitivity and screening efforts. He
said that it was only a partial solution and some of the programs
may fail.
   The mayor did not set a cost for his plan, nor did he say how it
would be financed, but City Manager Cesar Odio said city resources
for helping impoverished sections were slim.
   ``We're almost taxed out,'' Odio said. ``There's no more we can
do with taxes.''
   Black leaders gathered 200 residents and high school students at
a community center for a previously scheduled workshop on
non-violent conflict resolution and the teachings of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. They said they hoped the session, at which Suarez
also appeared, would help calm tensions.
   Yolanda King, daughter of the slain civil rights leader, said her
father would not have advocated violence but would have been
heartened that the needs of the community were receiving attention
because of the unrest.

<TEXT>
   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is fighting a legal
battle with Wampanoag Indians over a strip of beach on chic Martha's
Vineyard that they consider sacred.
   The Indians portray Mrs. Onassis as a rich newcomer intent on
grabbing their tribal lands to round out her private summer retreat
on the resort island off Cape Cod.
   But her New York City lawyer, Alexander D. Forger, says the
former first lady has tried to deal fairly with the Indians,
offering to swap better land or buy the beach for a fair price.
   The Indians, descendants of the island's original inhabitants,
seem to be trying to take advantage of her wealth and the publicity
her name can generate, he added.
   ``Because the interested party is Mrs. Onassis, it seems evident
that they believe thay can obtain five times what the property is
worth,'' Forger said Friday.
   Mrs. Onassis' real estate trust is suing for partition of the
1.5-acre stretch of pristine dunes, a legal maneuver that could
result in the property being put up for sale to the highest bidder.
   A pretrial conference was held earlier this week at the Dukes
County Probate Court in Edgartown. The original motion was filed
Aug. 12, 1980, but the lawsuit lay dormant for years.
   Paul J. Sulla, a Boston lawyer representing about a dozen of the
Indians, said little doubt exists about who the high bidder would be.
   ``Most of my clients have little or no money, and there is no way
they can compete with Jackie,'' he said.
   Mrs. Onassis' trust already has a one-seventh interest in the
land. The remaining shares are owned by more than 25 Wampanoag
Indians.
   Mrs. Onassis wants to buy out the Indians and gain sole ownership
of the 264-foot-long stretch of beach because she owns all the land
around it: a 400-acre tract that includes her summer home and guest
house, Forger said.
   The property, in the town of Gay Head, ``is rapidly being eroded
by the Atlantic and is expected not to exist in another 10 years,''
he said.
   Mrs. Onassis offered to swap a larger beachfront property that is
not subject to erosion and has better access, but the Indians
declined, Forger said.
   Sulla said the Indians are willing to respect Mrs. Onassis'
privacy but would like her to allow them to swim and pick wild
berries on the beach as they have for generations.
   ``Jackie's property completely surrounds the Indians' land, and
she has guards at both ends of her beach to keep everyone away,''
Sulla said. ``But this area is very sacred to the Wampanoags. This
is where their great chief resides in legend. They say he smokes his
pipe, and that's where the fog comes from.''
   Mrs. Onassis's trust bought the 400 acres on Martha's Vineyard in
the mid-1970s and has brought a series of court actions to try to
clear title to the land. Titles in Gay Head are often unclear
because the town was divided into a checkerboard pattern in the
1870s, and many lots have no legal access.
   Joan Patadal, a tribal member whose family has a small share in
the land, said the property is the only piece of beach Indians still
own in Gay Head. Most of the Wampanoag tribal lands have gradually
been lost or sold, and the Indians intend to preserve what they've
got left, she said.
   ``Nobody wants to sell tickets for people to see Jackie,'' Mrs.
Patadal said. ``We're not interested in that. We just want to be
able to get to our beach.''

<HEAD>Foreign Minister's Good English Seen As Bad For Portuguese Diplomacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of Portugal has had
his knuckles rapped for what is usually considered an essential
skill in modern diplomacy _ speaking English.
   Newspapers and politicians have harshly criticized Joao de Deus
Pinheiro ever since he spoke English earlier this month at an
international conference on chemical weapons in Paris.
   Critics say it breaks a pledge by the seven Portuguese-speaking
nations to promote their language _ the sixth most widely spoken in
the world _ at international events.
   More importantly, they charge Pinheiro hurt Portugal at a time
when its influence among former colonies is increasingly being
challenged by one of them _ Brazil.
   ``No speak Portuguese,'' was the motto plastered across the
T-shirt of a cartoon of Deus Pinheiro on the cover of the satirical,
right-wing weekly O Diabo.
   Another paper this week showed the stocky, bearded minister
introducing himself as ``God Pine'' _ the direct English translation
of his name.
   While Deus Pinheiro has been busy drumming up international
financial support for an economic recovery plan for the other major
Portuguese-speaking countries of Angola and Mozambique, Brazil has
outflanked Portugal on trade and relief efforts.
   Trade between Angola and Brazil has quadrupled the last three
years to more than $1 billion.
   Portugal's trade with Angola dropped from about $165 million in
1986 to $127 million in 1987. For the first eight months of 1988,
the countries' did about $103 million in business.
   Deus Pinheiro's recovery plan foresees $600 million dollars worth
of aid from several nations to Angola, but Brazil has already
granted Luanda a $1.1 billion credit that the African nation repays
in oil it produces.
   According to one government official in Brasilia, next week's
planned visit by President Jose Sarney to Angola, the first ever by
a Brazilian head of state, should increase cooperation between the
countries.
   Brazil already sells food, cars, and farm machinery to the
southern African nation and is helping to build a hydroelectric dam
there. Brazilian companies are now showing interest in helping
rebuild Angola's ravaged telephone and power networks.
   ``We think Portugal made an error (at the Paris conference),''
said Mozambique's secretary of state for foreign affairs, Antonio
Materrula. ``We have to push our mutual language at an international
level.''
   Portuguese is not an official language of the United Nations, but
the countries that use it _ Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome e Principe _ count
about 180 million inhabitants.
   Only Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, English, Spanish and Russian are
spoken by more people worldwide.
   Brazilian and Mozambican delegates at the chemical weapons
conference spoke in Portuguese, further enraging Portugal's
politicians, scholars and journalists.
   ``It's a scandalous insult to the values and interests of our
language,'' said Herminio Martinho, leader of Portugal's New
Democratic Party.
   ``The importance of this language should be turned into a
diplomatic tool _and we (Portugal) don't have many others,'' said
Jorge Sampaio, newly elected leader of Portugal's main opposition
Socialist Party.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
inaugural address as delivered on Friday.
   Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
   Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator
Mitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and
fellow citizens, neighbors and friends.
   There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts
_ and in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our nation, I
thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America.
   I have just repeated word-for-word the oath taken by George
Washington 200 years ago; and the Bible on which I placed my hand is
the Bible on which he placed his.
   It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not
only because this is our bicentennial inauguration, but because
Washington remains the father of our country. And, he would, I
think, be gladdened by this day. For today is the concrete
expression of a stunning fact: Our continuity these 200 years since
our government began.
   We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk as
neighbors, and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made
whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.
   And, my first act as president is a prayer. I ask you to bow your
heads:
   ``Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for your love.
Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared
faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your
work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts
these words: `Use power to help people.' For we are given power not
to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world,
nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve
people. Help us remember, Lord. Amen.''
   I come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with
promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it
better.
   For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom
seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the
dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas
blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree.
   A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom
stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new
action to be taken.
   There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and
wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path.
   But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk
right through _ into a room called Tomorrow.
   Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy _ through
the door to freedom.
   Men and women of the world move toward free markets _ through the
door to prosperity.
   The people of the world agitate for free expression and free
thought _ through the door to the moral and intellectual
satisfactions that only liberty allows.
   We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom
is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for
man on earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and
the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.
   For the first time in this century _ for the first time in
perhaps all history _ man does not have to invent a system by which
to live. We don't have to talk late into the night about which form
of government is better. We don't have to wrest justice from the
kings _ we only have to summon it from within ourselves.

   We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a
saint in crucial things _ unity; in important things _ diversity, in
all things, generosity.
   America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil _ a place
we cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and
proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond
what we see, and that our strength is a force for good.
   But have we changed as nation, even in our time? Are we
enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility
of work and sacrifice?
   My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not
the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We
cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank
account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a
loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his
neighborhood and town better than he found it.
   And what do we want the men and women who work with us to say
when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than
anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had
gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of
friendship.
   No president, no government, can teach us to remember what is
best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this
government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the
quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of
better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he
must.
   America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high
moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to
make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.
   My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and
roaming _ there are the children who have nothing, no love, no
normalcy _ there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement
to whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rules
the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the
streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become
mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. They
need our care, our guidance, and education; though we bless them for
choosing life.
   The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money
alone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is not
so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring
down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.
   We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have, perhaps
allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need
and prudent safety.
   And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to the
only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the
goodness and the courage of the American people.

   And, I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others _ a
new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must
bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the
elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. For not only
leadership is passed from generation to generation, but so is
stewardship. And the generation born after the Second World War has
come of age.
   I have spoken of a ``thousand points of light'` _ of all the
community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the
nation, doing good.
   We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading,
sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White
House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the
programs that are the brighter points of light, and I'll ask every
member of my government to become involved.
   The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are
timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds
its expression in taking part and pitching in.
   And we need a new engagement, too, between the executive and the
Congress.
   The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and
Senate. And we must bring the federal budget into balance. And we
must ensure that America stands before the world united: strong, at
peace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult.
   We need compromise; we have had dissension. We need harmony; we
have had a chorus of discordant voices.
   For Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a
certain divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the
statements in which not each others' ideas are challenged, but each
others' motives.
   And our great parties have two often been far apart and
untrusting of each other.
   It's been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But,
friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and,
surely, the Statute of Limitations has been reached. This is a fact:
The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford
to be sundered by a memory.
   A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must be made
new again.
   To my friends _ and yes, I do mean friends _ in the loyal
opposition _ and, yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand.
   I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker.
   I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Majority Leader.
   For this is the thing: this is the age of the offered hand.
   And we can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our
fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the
water's edge. And we don't wish to turn back time. But when our
mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the Congress and the
executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on
which this nation could live.

   Let us negotiate soon _ and hard. But in the end, let us produce.
   The American people await action. They didn't send us here to
bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ``In crucial
things, unity'' _ and this, my friends, is crucial.
   To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We
will stay strong to protect the peace. The ``offered hand'' is a
reluctant fist; once made, strong and can be used with great effect.
   There are today Americans who are held against their will in
foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can
be shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good
will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.
   ``Great nations like great men must keep their word.'' When
America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an
agreement or a vow made on marble steps. We will always try to speak
clearly, for candor is a compliment. But subtlety, too, is good and
has its place.
   While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world
strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the
Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress.
One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph
of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good. And so is
strength. And vigilance.
   Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the
understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in
democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled.
   But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who
would be watching at home _
   To an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the
flag goes by, and the women who will tell her sons the words of the
battle hymns. I do not mean this to be sentimental. I mean that on
days like this, we remember that we are all part of a continuum,
inescapably connected by the ties that bind _
   Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land.
And to them I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. For
democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite
that can go higher and higher with the breeze...

   And to all I say: No matter what your circumstances or where you
are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great
nation.
   A president is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek ``a
window on men's souls.'' In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance,
an easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.
   There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up
united and express our intolerance. And the most obvious now is
drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may
as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body,
the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be
said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop.
   And so, there is much to do: and tomorrow the work begins.
   And I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead.
For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges
are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless,
God's love is truly boundless.
   Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets
calling. And sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with
many pages _ and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness
and meaning.
   The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds _ and so
today a chapter begins: a small and stately story of unity,
diversity and generosity _ shared, and written, together.
   Thank you.
   God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

<HEAD>Two Police Officers, Transient Die In Shootout Filmed By Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A transient grabbed a policeman's gun,
shot him to death and mortally wounded another officer before police
killed the man in a 30-second fusillade as a terrified student
television crew recorded the violence.
   The homeless man, identified as Dale Randy Connors, 35, was being
questioned by Officer Gene Simpson, 45, in front of a downtown
doughnut shop when a scuffle broke out around noon Friday, police
and witnesses said.
   Among the estimated 30 witnesses were Santa Clara University
students making a documentary on the homeless. As the videotape
rolled, Connors grabbed Simpson's pistol, chased the 19-year police
veteran and opened fire, wounding him and then fatally shooting him
in the head, police and witnesses said.
   ``He began pursuing the officer. The officer hit the ground. He
(the transient) cold-bloodedly pursued him,'' said Will Douglas of
Los Angeles, a witness who was driving through the area. ``I saw the
officer disappear behind a truck. I saw the man lower his gun and
shoot.''
   The film crew and other bystanders ducked behind cars and into
nearby businesses as shots rang out and a second patrolman, Gordon
Silva, was mortally wounded.
   The students' videotape, though jumpy and incomplete, shows the
transient firing at the wounded officers. A moment later, he is
shown lying in the street.
   On the tape, a cacophony of voices can be heard as members of the
film crew and their subjects try to figure out what happened.
Gradually, as the sound of sirens grows louder in the background,
they identify the gunman as a figure wearing a brown coat _ Connors.
   Although the tape is of poor quality, the man in the brown coat
can be seen firing a final shot, then jogging across the street with
the pistol in his hand. As the frequency of gunfire increases, a
hysterical woman shouts, ``Stay down! Stay down!''
   The next video image is of the gunman's motionless body in the
street.
   Police later said Simpson was dead at the scene.
   Silva underwent three hours of surgery at San Jose Medical Center
and received 50 units of blood, but doctors were unable to save the
17-year police veteran, authorities said.
   Among the witnesses was Mike Fletcher, another homeless man who
knew Connors only as Randy. He said said he thought something was
wrong with Connors when he saw him earlier in the day.
   ``I talked to him earlier this morning and he was in a trance, in
a daze,'' said Fletcher.
   Simpson apparently approached Connors initially because the
transient had been acting oddly. Witnesses said the homeless man had
been waving his arms as if he were trying to direct traffic.
   Another witness, Vince Ojeda, said Connors ``just grabbed the
cop's gun and the cop took off. The guy started shooting. ... He
fired about three (shots) or more. The cop took off and then a
minute later, there were a lot of cops _ a ton of cops were
shooting.''
   Other shootings of police involving transients have occurred
across the nation in recent years.
   In one of the more highly publicized cases, a white Dallas police
officer was killed last year by a mentally ill, black transient who
grabbed his gun and shot him while a crowd watched and some
witnesses allegedly shouted, ``Shoot, shoot!'' The transient was
later killed by police.

<HEAD>Military Unlikely To Allow Elections Until 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government blamed lawlessness
for delaying free elections, and official sources said balloting to
end more than a quarter-century of one-party rule might not take
place until 1990.
   ``We need peace and tranquility in the country. If there is no
law and order, how can we have elections?'' said Brig. Gen. Khin
Nyunt, ranked No. 2 in a military council that has ruled Burma since
it seized power Sept. 18 and brutally put down a nationwide uprising.
   The general did not specify Friday what disorder the nation was
experiencing, and there has been no known resurgence of violent
protest since the government, by its count, killed 500 people after
the takeover.
   Western diplomats say about 1,000 were killed and dispute the
government's claim that most of those killed were looters and
``destructive elements'' _ not pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Khin Nyunt told a news conference the government would keep
schools closed, maintain a curfew and continue restrictions on
opposition parties being mentioned in the state controlled media.
   ``Further opening will come slowly,'' he said.
   He repeatedly denied the government had arrested, tortured or
executed student activists who had returned from border areas after
fleeing the military repression.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International claimed
earlier this month that students returning from the Thai-Burmese
border had been arrested. The U.S. State Department said it had
``credible reports'' that some returnees had been executed.
   Rangoon says about 2,000 students and others who participated in
pro-democracy demonstrations last year have returned home, among
them 320 repatriated under a Thai government-sponsored program.
   Shunned by the international community, including former aid
donors Japan and West Germany, the military has attempted to improve
its tarnished rights image.
   The news conference came at the end of a three-day, four-city
trip arranged for 46 foreign correspondents, who interviewed nearly
150 repatriated students and some of their parents.
   Burmese officials could not recall such a large foreign press
presence since the country gained independence from Britain in 1948.
   Speaking with the authorities present, most students denied
knowledge of arrests or lengthy interrogations although a few said
they knew of some returning activists who were detained.
   Among students the government assembled for the journalists in
the city of Taunggyi were Myo Win Htun and Kyi Moe, whom Amnesty had
said were feared arrested.
   Myo Win Htun charged Thai authorities had exerted ``psychological
pressure'' on him and some colleagues to return to Burma from a
special repatriation center. He said he was forced to dig cesspools
and cut down trees. He went on a hunger strike to protest his return.
   Thailand has said that all students returned voluntarily from its
border center.
   ``We were not molested but we're uncertain about our situation,''
said Aung Htu, a 26-year-old student from Meiktila. He and virtually
all others expressed their support for a democractic system and free
elections.
   Khin Nyunt said he could not specify the date of elections to end
one-party rule that began in 1962.
   But official sources said these would probably not take place
until late this year or 1990. While the military had not set a
polling date, Western analysts had speculated they would be held
before mid-1989.
   To date, 182 political parties have registered with the election
commission.
   Khim Nyunt, secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration
Council, acknowledged that authorities were detaining some people,
including lawyer Nay Min and political satirist Thu Ra, on charges
of inciting insurrection and endangering national unity during the
uprisings.
   But he denied Nay Min and Thu Ra had been tortured or poorly
treated in detention.
   Uprisings last year prompted the resignation of Ne Win, who took
over in a 1962 military coup. Pro-democracy protests by hundreds of
thousands of people forced the resignation of his successor and led
to the sacking of another by the military.

   Federal investigators probing allegations of
widespread fraud at the nation's largest futures exchanges pressured
three suspects into secretly taping conversations with employers and
other traders, a newspaper reported today.
   The three were among a number of traders suspected of fraud who
have provided the FBI with fresh evidence in the two-year probe, the
Chicago Tribune said, quoting unidentified sources.
   FBI agents have been visiting the homes of traders suspected of
wrongdoing, threatening them with criminal charges and demanding
cooperation, the newspaper reported.
   Law enforcement sources said the three suspects were fitted with
hidden recording devices and told to call on colleagues to obtain
recorded admissions of guilt from those involved in fraud at the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The investigation centers on allegations that investors were
cheated out of millions of dollars, according to published reports.
   Seats on the exchanges, which go for hundreds of thousands of
dollars, have been selling like hot commodities by traders panicked
by the probe.
   Fourteen seats were sold at the Merc and the Board of Trade
starting Thursday, when the investigation was first reported,
through the end of business hours Friday.
   ``We had a week's worth of sales in a day,'' said Andrew Yemma,
chief spokesman for the Merc.
   Officials in the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office have said nothing
publicly about the investigation, but news of subpoenas for exchange
records dating back to January 1983 has shaken the industry.
   ``Everybody is obviously concerned about what this means,'' said
Board of Trade spokesman Raymond Carmichael.
   ``If there are people breaking the rules, of course people that
make an honest living in this business think they ought to be
punished,'' a Merc pork belly trader, who asked that his name not be
used, said after a day of trading Friday.
   ``The mood's very uneasy,'' said a soybean futures trader, who
also asked that his name not be used. ``Everybody's worried about
what's going to happen. ... It's very unsettling to long-time
members.''
   Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which
speculators bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods
ranging from gold to Treasury bills to frozen orange juice.
   FBI agents-turned-traders recorded conversations that suggest
some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting
fair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false reports to
customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on
commissions, the Chicago Tribune has said.
   FBI spokeswoman Jane Koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the
investigation, but two law enforcement officials in Washington,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed it Thursday.
   The seats, which allow traders access to various markets on the
trading floor, sell for a wide range of prices. The Merc has 2,724
seats and the Board of Trade has 3,400.
   Last year the price of a Merc seat ranged from $350,000 to
$523,500, officials said. Prices for Board of Trade seats ranged
from $371,000 to $545,000.

<TEXT>
   The FBI's undercover probe of the world's two
largest futures exchanges exposes the fraud potential that many
believe is inherent in the industry's raucous, century-old trading
method.
   The investigation of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange reportedly targets individual traders who rigged
trades and skimmed profits.
   Unlike Wall Street's insider-trading scandal, which apparently
involved a relatively small number of professionals active in a
limited segment of the stock market, the commodities allegations
strike at the heart of the futures industry _ the crowded trading
``pits'' where the business actually takes place.
   Experts say the frenetic trading system used in the pits provides
opportunity for fraud and raises problems in tracking whether
traders are obeying the rules.
   Futures traders in the pits stand shoulder-to-shoulder,
frequently for hours at a time, shouting and using hand signals to
strike deals.
   This system is known as ``open-outcry'' trading and has remained
essentially unchanged since the early days of grain trading on the
141-year-old Chicago Board of Trade, the world's oldest and largest
futures exchange.
   Trading is permitted only in the pits during specified trading
hours and traders are forbidden by exchange rules from playing
favorites. A trader seeking to sell a contract must accept the first
offer that meets his asking price.
   At least part of the FBI probe is believed to be focused on pairs
of traders who arranged ahead of time complicated trading schemes
that would allow both of them to share in profits skimmed from
customer accounts.
   Such schemes often involve executing customer orders and trading
for one's own account simultaneously, a controversial _ but entirely
legal _ practice.
   The investigation also is believed to have uncovered instances in
which traders simply reported to their brokerage firms trades that
were different from the trades they actually made.
   These instances also require collusion among traders because
exchange rules require both the buyer and the seller to report their
trades.
   Pre-arranged trading and commodity fraud are nothing new; traders
readily admit that the potential is always there for those so
inclined, partly because of the difficulty in monitoring traders
both inside and outside of the pits.
   It is not unusual for unscrupulous traders to be caught. On
Thursday, even as news of the FBI probe was breaking, the Chicago
Merc announced the unrelated expulsion of two of its members for
pre-arranging trades.
   The most alarming aspects of the FBI investigation are its
breadth _ one news service reported that 150 people could be
implicated _ and its depth. Undercover agents wearing concealed
microphones reportedly recorded conversations with other traders on
and off the exchange floors over a period of two years.
   ``There's a fear of the unknown'' among Chicago's trading
community, said John Troelstrup, an industry lawyer. ``It's the
sudden realization that they have been in the midst of people who
are not of them, wearing wires.''
   Some experts see the advent of electronic trading _ using
computerized rather than human traders to match customer buy and
sell orders _ as a way to reduce the fraud potential of commodities
trading.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is a leader in this area and is
preparing to launch a fully automated trading system called Globex
that would operate during the hours its trading floor is closed.
   The Chicago Board of Trade opposes the concept, saying the
open-outcry system is more efficient, and has raised objections with
federal regulators who have yet to approve Globex.
   But even electronic trading would not erase the potential for
abuse, experts say.
   ``It will be easier to keep track of trades that are recorded
electronically than it is when you depend on people in the pits to
write them down in the midst of furor,'' said one industry
consultant. ``But just like electronic banking, they'll have
problems that nobody anticipated.
   ``Somebody who knows the system can figure out innovative ways to
beat the system,'' he said.

   Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which
speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices
of goods ranging from gold to Treasury bills to frozen orange juice.
   The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of
price fluctuations from people who don't want the risk, such as
farmers or metals processors, to speculators who are willing to take
a gamble on making big profits.
   Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods
at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options, which
also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the right
but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price
within a specified period.
   Commodities traders, standing in recessed ``pits'' and dressed in
brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to each
other in a free-for-all auction of contracts.
   Because trading is so chaotic, some rules infractions are hard to
detect immediately. For example, a dishonest trader could cheat a
client by paying more than necessary for a contract ordered by the
client. The seller who got the extra profit would later return the
favor.
   In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who
wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise to
deliver 20,000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future date
at a specified price.
   Assuming the price goes up, the speculator who buys the contract
could take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to someone
else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the profit.
   But if the price goes down, the speculator would lose money by
having to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the
cattle at the lower market price.
   In practice, speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or
pork bellies _ they sell their positions at a profit or loss before
the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer that actually
needs the commodity.
   Although the exchanges started out with agricultural products,
they have rapidly expanded into financial products. For example, the
Chicago Board of Trade does most of its business in contracts based
on the value of the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock
indexes.
   Other major exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange in New
York, the New York Cotton Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, and abroad, the London International Financing Futures
Exchange.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Deported From Britain Returns Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sri Lankan man deported from Britain
after a two-year battle for asylum returned home today and accused
the British government of racism.
   Viraj Mendis had sought asylum since late 1986 by holing up in an
English church. His fight ended when British authorities broke into
the church Wednesday and two days later put him on an Air Lanka
flight to his Indian Ocean homeland.
   ``I am happy to be back in my homeland, but I am angry for being
deported by the racist British government,'' the 32-year-old Mendis
told reporters upon his arrival.
   He was escorted by a British policeman, two British immigration
officers and the Rev. Henry West, an Anglican priest who described
himself as a friend.
   Mendis said he feared persecution or death if he returned to Sri
Lanka, which is wracked by ethnic violence between guerrillas of the
majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. Nearly 10,000 people
have died in five years of fighting.
   Foreign Ministry Secretary W.T. Jayasimsghe said: ``I don't think
anything is going to happen to Mr. Mendis.''
   But Mendis said the government couldn't guarantee his safety.
   ``I am a Sinhalese and, as a Communist, support the Tamil
liberation struggle. I fear the Sinhalese chauvinists and, of
course, I don't believe any assurance given by the Sri Lankan
government.''
   Police arrested Mendis in the northern English city of
Manchester. He had moved into the church after being issued a
deportation order in 1986, 13 years after going to Britain as a
student.
   Mendis' removal from the church sparked an outcry from
supporters, who said the action violated his ancient right to
sanctuary in a church.
   Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crime
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the
country in 40 days. This right was abolished in 1623, but Mendis'
supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay in
Britain.
   Mendis was met at the airport by his younger brother, Suresh, and
an uncle, Eugene Fernando.
   Mendis said he would not be living with his family in the
southern town of Kalutara ``for security reasons.'' Instead, he
said, he is heading for an undisclosed location to write his memoirs.

<HEAD>Cold Weather Military Exercise to Begin in Alaska</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN FOSDICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 26,000 troops, 120 aircraft and
1,000 vehicles from Canada and the United States began maneuvers
across Alaska in the military's regular test of personnel and
machines in freezing temperatures.
   ``This may be the premier cold-weather exercise in the Free
World,'' Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerney, commander of Joint
Task Force-Alaska, said Friday as the biennal exercise began Friday.
   ``Brim Frost '89'' _ a $15 million training exercise involving
the U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard,
reserve units and the Canadian Forces _ is to continue through Feb.
1.
   ``We hold some exercises like this in Norway, but they're a
little different,'' McInerney said. ``Here you have an entire (Army)
division operating in an arctic environment.''
   Maneuvers were planned at more than 17 sites around Alaska,
including Kodiak Island in the Pacific Ocean, but the focus will be
a major land battle between two Army brigades on the Tanana Flats at
Fort Greely, about 75 miles southeast of Fairbanks.
   That will include a battalion-sized Canadian force dropped by
parachute, officials said.
   ``It will be a rehearsal of the procedures we'd have to go
through if we actually had to defend Alaska,'' said Army Maj. Gen.
Harold T. Fields Jr., in charge of land forces during the exercise.
   Brim Frost '87 _ slightly smaller with 24,000 troops _ focused
primarily on unconventional warfare, where Alaska forces faced
guerrilla units and defended airfields, remote radar stations,
ports, a trans-Alaska oil pipeline pump station and other sites from
attack.
   Planners said they will emphasize safety throughout Brim Frost
'89. No live ammunition is to be used, but troops will face
temperatures that are expected to plummet to 50 degrees below zero.
   ``Safety is a very challenging thing,'' McInerney said. ``If you
don't have any accidents, then it's a tribute to your
professionalism.''
   ``Our track record in the past has been very good,'' Fields said.
``Last month, 3,500 soldiers at Fort Greely trained in weather that
was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no serious
cold-related injuries.''
   Fields said at a news conference Wednesday there is a lot of
difference between simply being out in the cold and operating in the
cold.
   ``We'll not back off our exercises simply because the weather
drops,'' Fields said. ``It teaches you how to cope. Our potential
adversaries are very good at this business.''

<HEAD>South Korea Agrees To Preparatory Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea today accepted a North
Korean call for working-level border contacts to arrange high-level
talks on easing tension on the divided Korean peninsula.
   Government officials said a telephone message was issued through
the border truce village of Panmunjom to inform North Korea that
South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon would deliver a letter
Monday to his North Korean counterpart, Prime Minister Yon Hyung Muk.
   Kang's letter would contain remarks agreeing to Yon's earlier
proposal that a Feb. 8 meeting be held at Panmunjom by vice
ministers to work out terms for full-scale talks, they said.
   It was not clear if South Korea would agree to the date set by
the north. The two Koreas have agreed to hold political and military
talks headed by their prime ministers on ending military
confrontation to help unify the peninsula.
   If realized, the talks would be involve the highest level of
officials since the Korean War began in 1950.
   Korea was split into the communist north and the capitalist south
in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule at
the end of World War II.
   Talks in the past have produced little progress, with each side
insisting on its own proposals.
   In today's message, South Korea also said its Red Cross officials
would send a letter Tuesday urging North Korea to resume Red Cross
talks stalled in 1985. North Korea has rejected South Korean calls
for separate economic and Red Cross talks.
   The north closed several channels of talks on humanitarian and
other concerns in 1985 to protest annual U.S.-South Korean military
exercises.

   Salvador Dali was in critical condition
today, afflicted with severe heart trouble and pneumonia, his
physician said.
   Carles Punsati told reporters at Figueras Hospital that the
84-year-old artist's ``clinical situation had not changed
signicantly overnight.
   ``Thus, his condition remains extremely critical,'' the doctor
said.
   A hospital spokeswoman, who was not identified in keeping with
custom, said Dali had spent ``a tranquil night'' and was awake in
bed listening to classical music.
   The noted artist was hospitalized Wednesday in this northeastern
Spanish town where he was born after his condition deteriorated.
   Dali, who has suffered chronic heart ailments in recent years,
has been hospitalized three times since November.
   A founding member of the surrealist movement, Dali is the last of
an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a decade later.

   Promoters conceded that Super Bowl week was a
fiasco, but remained confident the weekend festivities and game
could be salvaged despite three days of rioting and racial unrest.
   ``There is no question that it really hurts, but we think our
community can recover,'' Charles Scurr, president of the Greater
Miami Super Bowl Host Committee, said Friday. ``It's already started
... The mood is lifting and I think people will be able to enjoy the
celebration.''
   Miami once viewed Super Bowl week as a crown jewel in the tourism
comeback for south Florida.
   Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis performed Friday
night at the Miami Arena, and another concert was scheduled for
tonight.
   At a Miami shopping center and park, thousands of excited
partiers watched fireworks explode over Biscayne Bay and listened to
salsa and jazz bands.
   In Miami Beach, 3,000 people held a bash held by National
Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle at the Stephen Muss
Convention Center.
   Miami has worked to rebuild its image as a tourist mecca since
1980, when the troubles began: devastating riots that year, the
Mariel Boatlift, the upspurt in the drug trade and bad press such as
a ``Paradise Lost'' cover story in Time magazine.
   ``Those factors created such an unappealing perception of the
place,'' said Ruben Aguilar, an executive with the Greater Miami
Convention and Visitor's Bureau. ``We lost 1.3 million tourists in
the next five years.''
   But in the last few years, he said, ``We felt like we were on a
roll.''
   Earlier this week, riots triggered by the shooting of a black
motorcyclist by a Hispanic policeman left one man dead and 11 others
shot in two black neighborhoods. Thirteen buildings were torched and
others looted, authorities said.
   Veteran Miami publicist Hank Meyer said the tragedy of those
riots went far beyond the damage to the tourism industry and the
city's image.
   ``I was saddened ... a feeling of shock, disbelief,'' said the
68-year-old Meyer, who has lived here for 50 years.
   The city has made major strides to come back after the heyday of
the 1950s and '60s, when TV shows like Jackie Gleason's originated
in Miami, helping to make the tropical city popular throughout the
country, Meyer said.
   But in the 1970s, the hotels began to age, too many apartments
and condos were built, and the economy declined.
   The devestating blow came in 1980, with the boatlift and the
riots, which killed 18 and injured hundreds. More riots followed in
1982 and 1984.
   The Miami area had about 7 million visitors in 1980. It finally
approached that total again in 1988.
   The completion of the colorful Bayside Marketplace in 1987 and
the Miami Arena last year helped revive the inner city, and the art
deco district of Miami Beach is coming back.
   Landing the Super Bowl seemed to put the seal of approval on
Miami as a tourist destination. But this week's rioting brought the
progress into question.
   ``My first reaction was `Why now?''' said Aguilar. ``If it had
happened when we didn't have 2,000-plus media here, then I don't
think the nationwide response would have been as wide-ranging and
immediate as it was.''
   But the city seemed to be easing back to normal. Police were out
in force to assure the weekend is a success. And Rozelle reassured
Miami that the riots would not affect the city's chance to host
another Super Bowl.

   Field Marshal Lord Harding, who commanded an
armored division in the World War II battle of El Alamein and
shrugged off death threats as governor of Cyprus in the 1950s, died
Friday at the age of 92.
   In World War I, Harding served in Egypt, took part in the
Gallipoli and Palestine campaigns, was wounded twice and won the
Military Cross.
   In 1940, he commanded the 7th Armored Division in the Battle of
El Alamein and on the victorious pursuit of Field Marshal Erwin
Rommel's German forces to Tripoli, Libya.
   In 1951, Harding was appointed commander-in-chief of the British
Army of the Rhine, and remained in Germany until his appointment as
chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1952. His promotion to field
marshal came in 1953.
   Harding was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Cyprus,
then a British colony, in 1955. Throughout his two-year tour, he was
the target of a ``Death to Harding'' campaign by the EOKA guerrilla
organization.
   One of Hardings most famous actions was to order the banishment
of Archbishop Makarios to the Seychelles. Makarios was later
president of Cyprus, which became independent in 1960.

<HEAD>Gang Member: Robinson Held Power With El Rukn</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former member of a Chicago street gang
testified that Noah Robinson, half-brother of Jesse Jackson, wielded
a great deal of power over the organization, which was known for its
violence.
   Robinson is on trial for murder and conspiracy in the January
1986 death of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber. Robinson is accused of
hiring the El Rukn gang to go to Greenville to kill Barber, who was
Robinson's childhood friend.
   Eugene Hunter, formerly a high-ranking member of the El Rukn
gang, testified Friday that he participated in planning Barber's
slaying but did not pull the trigger.
   Hunter testified that he and another member of the gang met with
Robinson about a week after Christmas in 1985.
   ``He had said he had been home and had a fight with Hambone, and
he had kicked his behind,'' he testified. ``He said he was tired of
the situation and wanted us to take care of it.''
   Hunter, who has also been charged with murder in the death, said
Robinson was a close friend of Jeff Fort, the chief of El Rukn now
in a Texas prison.
   ``He (Fort) told us whenever you listen to Noah Robinson, it's
like you listen to me,'' Hunter said. ``If he says do something,
it's like I said do it.''
   Robinson, a Greenville native who now lives in Chicago, has
maintained that he is a victim of a political conspiracy caused
partly by the success of his half-brother. Robinson and Jackson have
the same father, but the former Democratic presidential candidate
has said he has had no recent contact with his half-brother.
   Earlier Friday, another witness for the prosecution testified
that she heard Robinson threaten to kill Barber and that Barber had
a heavy cocaine habit she helped supply.
   Hunter described the complicated structure of the Chicago gang
and how they made millions of dollars through narcotics, contract
murder and extortion.
   Hunter said he first met Robinson when the gang attempted to move
into some legitimate businesses.
   Circuit Judge James Moore agreed Thursday to combine the murder
and conspiracy charges and the charge that Robinson conspired to
kill a witness to Barber's death, who survived a stabbing attack.

   As George Bush slept for the first time in the
White House, 1,000 revelers spent today's early morning hours
dancing to an up-tempo ``Hail to the Chief'' in a no-holds-barred
spoof of his inauguration.
   Partygoers at the Los Angeles Inaugural Ball greeted Bush
impersonator Chuck Kovacic with boos and derisive whistles as the
look-alike mimicked the new president in a satirical address.
   ``Here comes the theme,'' Kovacic said after being introduced by
cartoon characters Batman and Robin and sworn in by a human Statue
of Liberty. ``A new breeze. There's a new breeze blowing. We all can
feel it ... especially the millions who choose to sleep in the great
outdoors.
   ``As there's hope, there will be a new breeze. But if that breeze
blows too hard, it will extinguish the 1,000 points of light and you
won't be able to read my lips.''
   The party was held to greet the installation of Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle with cheery displeasure. Of those in attendance
asked about their political preferences, almost all voted for
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the November election.
   The West Coast inauguration, advertised as ``the political party
for the rest of us,'' featured lighting by Thousand Points of Light
Inc. and performances of the satirical songs ``A Kinder, Gentler
Nation'' and ``Out of the Loop.''
   Admission was $15, but card-carrying members of the American
Civil Liberties Union got in for $13.50. Any profits were to be
donated to an environmental group.
   ``It's absolutely a celebration, but, of course, black is to be
worn,'' said organizer Pacy Markman, an advertising copywriter.
``The inauguration in Washington was done with smoke and mirrors.
We're just merely holding up the mirror.''
   Markman wrote both ``A Kinder, Gentler Nation'' and ``Out of the
Loop.'' The latter song, the title of which refers to Bush's
response to questions about his involvement in the Iran-Contra
affair, also hints at the party's real purpose _ to point up the
president's supposed shortcomings.
   ``I was out of the loop when it happened,'' goes the song. ``I
was out of the loop through it all. I'll give you a scoop, I was out
of the loop. Talking to me is like talking to a wall.''
   ``We're not wishing Mr. Bush ill,'' Markman said. ``But the whole
idea of this is that people have really been put to sleep by Reagan
and you can either awaken them by a slap in face ... or, as we're
hoping, to wake them up with some good humor and some excellent
music.
   ``We weren't invited to the other inaugural. But ours is not out
of spite. It's very possible that we might have done this if there
were a Democrat in office.''

<HEAD>Senator Reportedly in Argument in New York Bar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., got into a
shouting argument in a Manhattan bar with a former bouncer who
``insulted the memory of his brothers,'' according to a Kennedy
spokesman.
   Dennis McKenna, 32, a former city hospital security officer who
once worked at the Upper East Side bar, American Trash, said he
filed a harassment complaint with police, which was later dropped.
   Police said Friday they were unable to confirm whether a
complaint had been filed after the alleged Jan. 12 incident.
   Bar manager Brian Woods said Kennedy came into the bar about 2:30
a.m. that day. ``He was hanging out, talking to some people, and
Dennis McKenna was being a real jerk,'' Woods said.
   According to reports Friday in the Boston Herald and on Fox
Television's ``A Current Affair,'' McKenna said he had gone over to
Kennedy, told him he did not think it wise for him to be there and
offered to help him if he needed it.
   He said Kennedy, 56, answered that he did not need help, but
during a later confrontation, he told the senator, ``You're nothing
like your other two brothers.''
   McKenna said Kennedy then threw a drink at him. The two men went
outside and shouted at each other, and when McKenna went to pull
identification out of his wallet, Kennedy slapped his hand.
   Kennedy's press secretary, Paul Donovan, issued a statement in
Washington Thursday night saying the senator stopped at the bar
after going to the theater and eating supper.
   ``After dropping off friends on the Upper East Side, he stopped
at the bar on his way back to his sister Pat Lawford's apartment,''
the statement said.
   ``A stranger in the bar began to harass him, and when the man
insulted the memory of his brothers, Sen. Kennedy took offense and
angry words were exchanged.
   ``Sen. Kennedy said the incident was of no consequence, and he
regretted that it had occurred,'' Donovan said. He declined to
comment further.
   Woods said McKenna, who was once employed as a doorman at
American Trash, ``had a little too much to drink'' and was asked to
leave the bar after he hassled Kennedy.
   McKenna said he did not want to pursue the complaint because he
felt sorry for Kennedy, the Herald said in its Celebrity column.

<HEAD>Prayers, Counseling in Aftermath of School Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grief-stricken family and friends mourned
the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while
the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town.
   Parents and teachers continued counseling the children who
witnessed Tuesday's schoolyard slayings, trying to help them deal
with the tragedy.
   Patrick Purdy, 24, opened fire outside the Cleveland Elementary
School with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, firing more than
100 rounds, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one
teacher.
   Three days and nights of prayer began Thursday for two of the
youngsters killed, and services for the other children were being
held today and Monday. Gov. George Deukmejian was to attend Monday's
services.
   Purdy was buried Friday in nearby Lodi, said his grandmother,
Julia Chumbley. He was interred following a service at Cherokee
Memorial Cemetery, which several of his relatives attended, she said.
   Fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized, but
most were reported in improved conditions.
   At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the school's 970
pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the
number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine
school day.
   Counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in
classrooms, and some parents sat in with their children to comfort
and reassure them.
   One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that
her youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playground
when the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if she
stayed with him.
   ``They're making it back, slowly but surely,'' she said, adding
that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son's
side in the classroom.
   Cleveland School is in the heart of California's third-largest
community of refugees from Southeast Asia, and nearly two-thirds of
the school's population is from Asia. All of the dead children were
from refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded.
   School authorities said they were particularly concerned that the
killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the
horrors they experienced in Southeast Asia, but that those families
might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared
a racial motive in the attack.
   ``We want to pass the word to the community that this is not a
racist act ... It could happen to anybody, anywhere, anytime. This
is a crazy action from one individual. It is not racism,'' said An
Tran of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Program.
   Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry also repeated that there was
no evidence that Purdy, who committed suicide after the attack, was
specifically targeting Asians.
   ``It wasn't any one race or group of people. He hated
everybody,'' Perry said of Purdy, who as a child 14 years earlier
had attended Cleveland School.

   Lech Walesa met today with Solidarity's
National Executive Commission to hammer out an official response to
a Communist Party offer to legalize the trade federation.
   The Solidarity leader was expected to advise the union leadership
to begin long-delayed talks on Poland's future with the communist
government.
   Earlier today, Walesa attended a rally by 4,000 workers inside
the Lenin shipyard where Solidarity was born, but he did not speak.
   Walesa summoned the commission to this Baltic port to respond to
the Communist Party's announcement Thursday that it will legalize
Solidarity after a seven-year ban if certain conditions are
negotiated.
   The commission's 20 members and 10 advisers and local Solidarity
activists met at St. Mary's Basilica several blocks from the
shipyard, then moved to a more private meeting place at a convent
near the city's Old Town.
   In the past, the commission has followed Walesa's recommendations.
   Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, told suspicious
workers at the shipyard Friday he also has doubts about the
authorities' good intentions.
   The Polish government cracked down on the independent trade union
federation during the labor upheaval of 1980, declaring martial law
in December 1981 and banning Solidarity the next year.
   A tape recording of Friday's closed, 1{-hour meeting was obtained
by The Associated Press, and in reply to a question accusing
authorities of always lying to workers, Walesa said: ``I don't trust
them either. But if someone gives a chance for (trade union)
pluralism, I take the chance.''
   Walesa told the worker that the party's change in policy was
significant.
   ``They have never proposed pluralism before. And what's even more
_ economic, union and political pluralism. Our people are checking
already today what it may mean in practice.
   ``If we are really getting economic, social and political
pluralism, I say, `Thank you very much, gentlemen.' It has never
happened in the party before. It will mean breaking the monopoly.
And that's the point.''
   Later, Walesa told reporters at the shipyard gates, ``I will do
everything on my side to begin talks about Poland ... as soon as
possible.''
   But he said that was his personal view and Solidarity's official
statement would come only after the meeting of the executive
commission.
   The government proposed formal talks to include Walesa, the
authorities, the official trade unions and other social groups
during a wave of strikes in August. Poland is wracked by economic
unrest, rising inflation, scarce supplies of basic commodities and
its $39 billion foreign debt.
   After some fitful preliminary talks last year, Walesa refused the
invitation until the party agreed to legalize the union.
   This week's Communist Party plenum seems to have satisfied that
demand, said Adam Michnik, a senior adviser to Walesa.
   After that plenum, communist authorities said they would be
willing to legalize Solidarity if the trade union membership
promised to obey the law, not go out on strike for a period of time
and help reform the economy.
   Walesa told reporters he has to bargain with authorities because
Poland's problems are so daunting.
   Millions of Poles were treated to an unprecedented barrage of
openness in the official news media about Solidarity and other
sensitive political topics.
   The coverage left many people shaking their heads in wonder.
   ``What's going on in Poland?'' said one worker at the Gdansk
shipyard when asked about the heavy coverage that portrayed Walesa
as an official figure, even though Solidarity remains technically
illegal.
   State television also showed police controlling demonstrators in
Czechoslovakia, a Politburo member explaining why he voted against
the party's new position on unions, and a Solidarity-led strike at a
textile plant in Lodz.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Boeing 767 Wiring Checked In Addition to 757's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. operators of Boeing 767 jetliners have been
ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to inspect the wiring
in cargo compartment fire suppression systems.
   The FAA earlier required similar checks on Boeing 757 jets.
   Mitch Barker, spokesman for the FAA's Northwest regional office
here, said the airworthiness directive was issued late Friday as a
precautionary measure because of the similarity between the fire
protection systems on the two models.
   Last week, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive for U.S.
operators of the mid-sized 757s to check the cargo hold
fire-suppression systems after wiring problems were found on a Royal
Brunei jet and a Delta Airlines 757. Airlines around the world
subsequently found wiring mistakes on five more 757s.
   Investigators said some of the errors would have caused the wrong
extinquisher to work in the event of a cargo hold fire. Other
mistakes would have indicated a fire to the pilot without activating
an extinguisher.
   Wiring in Boeing planes got widespread public attention recently
following the Jan. 7 crash of a British Midlands Boeing 737 in
central England in which 44 people died. Faulty wiring is one
possibility being examined by investigators.
   On Thursday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes asked 26 operators of
767s worldwide to check the fire extinguisher wiring.
   ``We put one out yesterday alerting 767 operators worldwide to
inspect their fire extinguishing systems, not because there was any
incident involving a 767, but because it was prudent,'' Boeing
spokesman David Jimenez said Friday. He said the FAA directive ``now
just ensures it will be checked.''
   Both Jimenez and Barker said they knew of no wiring problems on
767s, although Jimenez said that last spring, some piping for
cargo-hold fire extinguishers on 767s were found to be misconnected.
   That problem was corrected, Boeing said.
   Barker said the 767 order ``calls for a check of cargo
compartment fire protection system wiring and, if necessary, to
ensure the wiring is correctly configured.''
   He said U.S. operators of the planes will be required to make the
inspection by Jan. 30 and to report any findings of incorrect wiring
to the FAA within 72 hours of making the check.
   Barker said the U.S. operators affected are American Airlines
with 40 767s, Delta Airlines with 30, United Airlines with 19,
Piedmont with 11 and Trans World Airlines with 11.
   Worldwide, there are 246 767s in service, Jimenez said. While the
FAA order is not binding on foreign carriers, Barker said many
foreign regulatory agencies often follow the FAA's lead in requiring
inspections.
   The 757 and 767, both twin-engine jets, were designed at the same
time in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The 767, which carries 170 to 261 passengers, depending upon
model and configuration, entered service in 1982. The 757, which
entered service in 1984, can carry between 186 and 239 passengers.

<HEAD>More Than 1,700 Officials Pay Respects To Late Emperor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,700 Cabinet members, lawmakers and other
government workers paid their respects to the late Emperor Hirohito
in a ceremony at the Imperial Palace today, palace officials said.
   The officials said 1,748 people attended the ceremony, held from
morning through evening at the palace ``hinkyu,'' or imperial
mortuary, where the body of the late emperor will remain until his
funeral on Feb. 24.
   Hirohito died Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and leading members of the three
branches of government paid their respects in a similar ceremony
Friday, a day after the emperor's coffin was moved to the makeshift
mortuary, the officials said.
   In addition, ceremonies will be held almost daily at the mortuary
until the funeral next month, with members of the imperial family
and Shinto ritualists offering prayers, food and court music.
   Shinto derives from ancient nature worship and today includes
worship of the sun goddess, the imperial ancestors and thousands of
other deities.
   Also today, a newspaper reported that Hirohito's son and
successor, Emperor Akihito, wrote in an essay in 1945 that Japan's
lack of group skills, material wealth and technological prowess led
to its World War II defeat despite the innate Japanese superiority
over Americans.
   The essay, penned by the then 11-year-old crown prince, was
copied by the late vice Grand Chamberlain Michio Kinoshita, an
employee of the Imperial Household Agency, and recently disclosed.
   ``If an individual Japanese is compared with an individual
American, a Japanese is superior on every point,'' the crown price
wrote shortly after the war, the daily Japan Times reported. But
Akihito added that Japanese lacked skills to efficiently organize
group strength.
   ``The people gathered their courage and fought diligently, but
the war was lost nevertheless,'' the crown prince wrote. ``That is
because the Anglo-American forces had incomparable material
superiority and because America's war tactics were extremely
skillful.''
   ``Japanese thought more of themselves than of their country and
acted selfishly. That is why we were not able to win this total
war,'' he wrote.
   He described the radio broadcast by his father in 1945 announcing
Japan's unconditional surrender to the Allies as a ``fearful thing''
for his father to ``bear the people's humiliation.'' He also
expressed regret over the defeat.
   The crown prince wrote of his determination that Japan be rebuilt
after the wartime destruction.

<HEAD>Extremist Leader Claims To Quash Challenge From Dissenters</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: TerreBlanch is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a nationwide
white-supremacist group, accused by colleagues of misconduct and
womanizing, claimed he won a unanimous vote of confidence at a
meeting today.
   Several of the dissenters said they were barred from the
auditorium or ejected before the vote was taken.
   Armed members of the group, wearing its swastika-like emblem,
patrolled outside the hall under the surveillance of about 100
policemen.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, a fiery orator who often closes his speeches
with a Hitler-style salute, has headed the Afrikaner Resistance
Movement since he helped found it in 1973. Its membership is kept
secret, but TerreBlanche often draws thousands of whites to his
rallies.
   The unprecedented challenge to his leadership began last month
after he allegedly tried to ram his car through a gate at an
Afrikaner historical monument near Johannesburg. He was accompanied
by Jani Allan, a former model who now writes a column for the
nationally circulated Sunday Times.
   TerreBlanche, who is married, has denied any improper
relationship with Ms. Allan. She had previously interviewed
TerreBlanche for one of her columns.
   The incident led to police filing a charge of malicious damage
against TerreBlanche, and four senior members of the resistance
movement demanded his resignation. One of them accused TerreBlanche
of womanizing and excessive drinking, charges which TerreBlanche
denied.
   About 300 members of the resistance movement _ known by its
Afrikaans initials as the AWB _ attended today's meeting at a hall
in Pretoria.
   Dries Alberts, a former AWB spokesman who had joined in
challenging TerreBlanche, told reporters he was carried out of the
meeting hall in his wheelchair after he arrived. Other dissenters
said they were barred from entering the hall.
   ``Today would have been an ideal opportunity for solving the
AWB's serious problems, but the meeting has been turned into an
utter farce,'' Alberts said.
   TerreBlanche declined to field questions from AWB delegates but
gave a 30-minute speech in which, to loud cheers, he reiterated his
call for creation of a whites-only state in South Africa.
   ``There will not and cannot be schism in the AWB,'' he said.
``The press thought I was going to resign today, but they will be
resigning instead.''
   After the meeting, some reporters were invited to attend a brief
news conference, but the Sunday Times' representative was not
allowed in.
   Despite its extremist stance, the AWB is viewed as politically
influential because of its ties to the Conservative Party, which won
26 percent of the vote in the 1987 white election on a platform
urging tougher enforcement of segregation laws.
   The governing National Party has emphasized the link between the
AWB and the Conservatives, seeking to suggest that the opposition
party is reliant on dangerous extremists.

<HEAD>Senator Says Marcos Could Return If He Gave Money Back</HEAD>

   A key senator said today the
government probably would let former President Ferdinand Marcos come
home if he returned money he is accused of stealing and made a
public apology.
   Jovito Salonga, the Senate president, said he believes Marcos
must do what South Korea's disgraced former president, Chun
Doo-Hwan, did last year.
   ``If Marcos decides to do a Chun Doo-Hwan _ that is, make a
public apology, seek our people's forgiveness and restore his
ill-gotten wealth _ there will be enough time for the former
president and his lawyers to initiate a plea- bargaining process ...
with the New York courts and prosecutors ... authorities in
Washington and the government of the Philippines,'' said Salonga.
   The government of President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow
Marcos to return to the Philippines. He fled to Hawaii after he was
swept out of office in February 1986 in a military-civilian uprising
that put Mrs. Aquino in power.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, face racketeering charges in New
York. They are accused of looting $103 million from the Philippines
and using it in part to buy real estate in New York.
   Critics say Marcos accumulated $5-$10 billion during his 20-year
administration.
   Salonga added that if Marcos ``decides to insist on his innocence
and refuses to do a Chun Doo-Hwan, the Aquino government may no
longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return.''
   Chun made a public apology to his country in November,
surrendered assets worth $24 million, and went into rural exile in a
remote temple.
   The Senate president, who formerly chaired a committee leading a
worldwide search for money Marcos is accused of stealing, made his
remarks today to a lawyer's group in the central port city of Cebu.
The Associated Press acquired a copy of his speech in Manila.
   In New York, a dispute over whether Marcos is too ill to be
arraigned on racketeering charges remains unresolved. The
71-year-old Marcos suffered a collapsed lung Thursday and was
reported hospitalized in Honolulu.

   For ice fishing fans Doris Julius and
Larry Issendorf, the best catch of the day was each other.
   They exchanged wedding vows on the thick ice of West Battle Lake,
but neither got cold feet in this western Minnesota town.
   The wedding took place at the head of a snowplowed heart
surrounded by fish houses.
   ``Several of our friends have fish houses out there, so there
were places to go to warm up,'' Julius said. ``Some people fished.''
   The ice-fishing nuptials Jan. 14 started as a joke for the
couple, who got engaged last Valentine's Day. But after awhile, the
joke started to make sense.
   ``We spend an awful lot of time out there ice fishing anyway, so
we thought we might as well get married out there,'' Issendorf said.
   The temperature reached into the 20s, so the couple didn't even
need the snowmobile suits they thought they would need for the
20-minute ceremony.
   Instead, the bride wore a white flannel shirt and blue corduroy
pants over her long underwear. An ivory-white hat, royal blue coat,
leg warmers over boots and a beaded scarf completed the look.
   The groom wore a green and purple plaid flannel shirt and navy
corduroy pants.
   ``I knew it'd be a special day,'' Julius said. ``But I didn't
think it would be quite like that.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany today closed its embassy
in Kabul, sources said, becoming the first foreign mission to shut
down amid fears of an economic blockade and increased violence after
all Soviet troops are withdrawn.
   The three remaining West German diplomats left this afternoon on
a flight for New Delhi, India, with no prior announcement, said the
Western diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Bonn, the West German Foreign Ministry confirmed it ordered
its diplomats to leave Kabul because of fears of increasing
violence. But it said the embassy would continue to function ``on a
reduced status'' and that the diplomats could return if the
situation in Kabul improves.
   Other Western embassis say they are reviewing their positions now
that it appears the Soviets may remove all their remaining troops by
next month.
   The British Embasy this week warned Britons and nationals of six
other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibiity to leave
immediately.
   Earlier today, the Soviet Union airlifted food supplies to the
Afghan capital to combat shortages caused by rebel attacks and bad
weather, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency reported from Kabul that the
3,500-ton airlift began Friday with three special flights.
   An English-language Tass report, monitored in Moscow, said six
flights arrived today with flour and other food supplies.
   There was no immediate independent confirmation the flights had
arrived.
   Traffic has been heavy at the airport since the beginning of the
month with giant transport planes arriving and leaving daily as
Soviet troops try to meet a Feb. 15 deadline to depart Afghanistan.
   The Afghan capital is increasingly tense because the withdrawal
date for the final 50,000 Soviet soldiers is drawing closer.
   In Bonn, Juergen Chrobog, chief spokesman for the West German
Foreign Ministry, said the remaining diplomats and their families
left Kabul today.
   But he said the embassy would continue to function ``on a reduced
status'' and be maintained by a small local staff.
   Chrobog said the envoys had been ordered home on leave ``because
of the growing danger'' and worsening economic conditions. Chrobog
said he did not know how long the diplomatic staff would remain out
of the country.
   ``We intend to watch developments there carefully before making a
decision on when to return,'' he said.
   Soviet officals have warned they might not meet the deadline set
in a U.N.-brokered accord because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani
assistance to the anti-Marxist resistance.
   But recent reports indicate Soviet soldiers might be gone from
Kabul by early February to protect the Salang highway during the
final withdrawal.
   U.N. aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged
similar help from Western nations, which refuse to deal with the
pro-Marxist government of President Najib.
   Guerrilla disruption of convoys, which are also carrying
ammunition, has been increasing as Soviet troops hand over escort
duties and positions to government units along the key Salang
highway from the Soviet border. Bad weather also has held up convoys.
   Today's English-language Tass report mentioned ``significant
shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition to
organize an economic blockade of the city.'' It also accused some
Kabul traders of engaging in ``open sabotage'' by hoarding food.
   Food prices have doubled in recent weeks, and long bread lines
have formed in 20-degree temperatures.
   The Soviet Union has promised to keep supplying arms to Najib's
shaky government after Feb. 15. But it is uncertain whether Moscow
will continue to supply Kabul, where guerrilla groups have closed in
in the surrounding hills.
   The Soviet military, which intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, is
expected to move its command from Kabul to a northern border post at
the end of January.

   After 11 years of silence about his crimes,
condemned killer Ted Bundy began confessing to about 30 murders of
young women in five Western states just days before his scheduled
execution, an attorney said.
   ``Murders are being solved,'' Volusia County State Attorney John
Tanner, who befriended Bundy, told The Orlando Sentinel on Friday
night.
   Bundy faces death in the electric chair at 7 a.m. Tuesday at
Florida State Prison near Starke for the 1978 murder of a
12-year-old girl in Lake City.
   Tanner said law enforcement officers from Western states told him
that the 42-year-old former law student ``is giving them verifiable
hard facts concerning unsolved murders,'' the newspaper reported
today.
   After a 40-minute hearing this morning, U.S. District Judge G.
Kendall Sharp rejected Bundy's latest appeal, ruling there was no
evidence a lower court judge talked privately to prosecutors about
Bundy's mental competence. The state Supreme Court curtly rejected
his appeal Friday.
   Bundy's attorney James Coleman said he would appeal to the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   Tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him, but said
Bundy met Friday with Robert Keppel of the Washington state attorney
general's office and Bill Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Sciences
Unit in Quantico, Va.
   Keppel met with Bundy from late Friday morning until late evening
and planned to meet with him today, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer
said. Keppel refused to discuss details of the conversations until
he completed them.
   Florida Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster said early
today he had no information on anything Bundy may have told other
law enforcement agencies.
   Bundy has frequently met with investigators and reporters, but
previously refused to talk specifically about any cases.
   He was also scheduled to meet over the weekend with authorities
from Colorado, Utah and Idaho.
   Bundy, who has also been sentenced to death for the 1978 slayings
of two sorority sisters at Florida State University in Tallahassee,
is suspected in as many as three dozen slayings in Washington,
Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Colorado. The victims were young women, many
of whom were never found. His case inspired the book ``The
Deliberate Stranger'' and the television miniseries of the same name.
   In considering Bundy's appeal Friday, the state Supreme Court not
only ruled against him, but said it would not permit a petition for
rehearing. It called the attempt to raise the issue of mental
competency again ``an abuse of process.''
   Tanner, a former defense attorney who was elected to the
prosecutor's post in November, was widely criticized Wednesday when
Gov. Bob Martinez and other state officials announced he was trying
to negotiate a stay of execution. But he said Friday that he is not
advocating that Bundy's life be spared.
   ``I want to emphasize that my role was to put Ted Bundy in
contact with law enforcement and I've done that,'' Tanner said.
``It's disturbed me that it's come out any different. It's caused
the people I represent to be very angry at me.''
   Authorities from Western states have said they want Bundy to
clear up the unsolved murders, but not if it meant delaying his
execution.
   ``Certainly we want to know. But I'm not sure it matters to the
extent of keeping him alive,'' said King County sheriff's Lt. Dan
Nolan in Seattle. ``Bundy is the quintessential manipulator, and
it's our opinion he's doing that again.''
   Salt Lake County Sheriff's Detective Dennis Couch said Friday
night that his scheduled 1{-hour interview with Bundy on Sunday
should be enough time to solve any cases in Utah.
   But the mother of Denise Naslund, 19, who was found dead just
outside Seattle two months after disappearing from a state park in
July 1974, said she wouldn't mind a postponement if Bundy would
confess.
   ``I would like to hear him say, `I did murder your daughter,'''
Eleanore Rose said. ``I'd have lot more peace of mind if he would.''
   Bundy is under his fourth death warrant. Martinez signed the most
recent warrant Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear
the case.
   Bundy's last stay of execution was in 1986, six hours before he
was to go to the electric chair.

<HEAD>Former Polish Prime Minister Dies At 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jozef Cyrankiewicz, the longtime prime
minister who signed the landmark 1970 agreement with West Germany
that formally established Poland's western border, has died, a news
agency reported today. He was 77.
   The official news agency, PAP, said Cyrankiewicz died Friday. It
did not give the cause of death or say where the death occurred. He
reportedly fell ill last last year but details of his ailment were
not disclosed.
   Born to an intelligentsia family in Krakow, Cyrankiewicz was a
resistance fighter during World War II and interned at the Auschwitz
concentration camp.
   Cyrankiewicz held top government post for 25 years, a period that
saw Poland develop into a one-party state in the Soviet bloc.
   He was prime minister in 1947 and then from 1954 to 1970.
   On Dec. 7, 1970, he and West German Chancellor Willy Brandt
signed the Warsaw Treaty that recognized the Oder-Neisse line as
Poland's western border and abandoned West Germany's claim to the
Reich borders of 1937.
   The treaty allowed for the detente process of the 1970s and gave
Poland access to the industrial and money markets of West Germany,
still its most imporant trade partner and holder of the largest
share of its multibillion dollar foreign debt.
   After leaving office, Cyrankiewicz became president of Poland's
Peace Committee and was not in public view again until last year.
   Cyrankiewicz had been reported ill late last year.

<HEAD>More than 4,000 Stolen Books Traced To Woman Who Died Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty boxes of stolen books that mysteriously
turned up on a library doorstep earlier this month have been traced
to a woman who died last year, authorities said.
   The boxes returned to the Thornhill Branch County Library Jan. 3,
along with several more boxes and other missing library items
recovered, yielded 4,369 books and magazines worth about $28,000,
library spokeswoman Jo Ann Rogers said Friday.
   The mystery was solved when a lawyer for the woman's estate
called several days after the initial dropoff and asked that the
library pick up the remaining books, Rogers said. The library
dispatched a van to pick up the other boxes, and staff members
needed two weeks to count, sort and return most of the materials to
regular circulation.
   The haul included 1,300 paperback novels, most of them romances,
and more than 400 magazines. The magazines and about 90 paperbacks
were not returned to circulation because they were in bad condition
or out of date.
   Most of the items appeared to have been taken between 1969 and
1984, when an electronic beeper security system was introduced at
the Thornhill Branch, Rogers said. None of the books had been
checked out.
   Rogers declined to identify the person who had taken the material
other than as an elderly woman who was a ``heavy user'' of Thornhill
materials.
   Rogers said the library had decided against charging penalties to
the woman's estate because the missing items had never been checked
out in the first place _ and thus carried no overdue fines _ and
because the items had been returned voluntarily.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha will probably
be discharged from a hospital next week but needs to rest for six
weeks to recover from his stroke, a Cabinet minister said today.
   Health Minister Willie Van Niekerk, who is a doctor, said in a
statement that Botha appeared to have made a remarkably speedy
recovery from the stroke he suffered at home Wednesday.
   The 73-year-old president was admitted to a military hospital in
the Cape Town suburb of Wynberg. Doctors later said the stroke had
weakened his left arm and leg but did not affect his facial muscles
and speech.
   On Thursday, Botha appointed a longtime ally, Constitutional
Development Minister Chris Heunis, as acting president.
   Van Niekerk's statement did not say if Botha would return to work
after his recovery.
   However, a pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, said today that
``the belief in government circles is that Mr. Botha will carry on
as president for the rest of this year _ or certainly until after a
general election, now expected in the second half of the year.''

   Israeli soldiers accidentally killed a
Palestinian mayor's bodyguard today while trying to defend the mayor
from Arab stone-throwers who accused him of collaborating with
Israel, Arab reporters said.
   An army spokesman said a Palestinian was killed early today by
soldiers in the West Bank village of Yatta, 10 miles south of
Jerusalem, but the spokesman could not confirm whether the man
worked as a bodyguard.
   Military sources said an Israeli-made Uzi machine gun was found
next to the body of the Palestinian man. The army routinely gives
weapons to pro-Israeli Palestinian figures.
   Arab reporters, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified
the dead man as Yasser Karaish, 28, and said he was a bodyguard for
Yatta's Israeli-appointed mayor, Ismaeel Abu Hemeid.
   The reports said a small crowd of young Palestinian nationalists
gathered in front of Hemeid's home early today and began shouting
slogans accusing him of collaborating with Israel. When the group
began to throw stones at his house, Hemeid called his armed
bodyguards and the Israeli army.
   Israeli troops rushed to the scene, saw Palestinians with guns in
front of Hemeid's home and opened fire, accidentally killing
Karaish, Arab reporters said. It was not immediately clear what
Karaish was doing when he was shot.
   Military sources said Israeli troops opened fire after being shot
at several times. An army spokesman said the military has sealed off
the village and is investigating the incident.
   The Arab reporters said the Israeli soldiers apparently thought
the bodyguards were members of a Palestinian strike force.
   On Thursday, a group calling itself the Palestinian Popular Army
issued a leaflet calling for attacks on soldiers and Jewish settlers.
   The PLO claims it is forming strike forces in villages and towns
throughout the occupied territories under the command of Force-17, a
unit of Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the PLO. There have
been no reported incidents of group members firing guns at Israeli
troops.
   More than a dozen Palestinians have been killed by their fellow
Arabs for cooperating with the Israeli military.
   On Friday, the deaths of two alleged collaborators were reported.
   Ahmed Jeredat, 36, was killed Thursday night by a shot in the
face in the West Banmk village of Atil, and Mohammed Irut, 18, died
Friday of wounds sustained in a Jan. 12 shooting in Nablus.
   Reporters said Jeredat was a shopkeeper who cooperated with the
Israeli government and Irut was from a family closely linked with
the authorities.
   Also today, a 60-year-old man was wounded in the neck in the
occupied Gaza Strip after troops opened fire with plastic bullets to
disperse stone-throwing youths. On Friday, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin gave troops permission to fire plastic bullets at
stone-throwers and Arabs setting up roadblocks.
   Fifteen Palestinians were wounded Friday in violence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 365 Palestinians have been killed
during the 13-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the
territories.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic magazine today said Pope John Paul
II plans to visit South Africa in 1990, but the Vatican refused to
confirm the report.
   The monthly, 30 Days, said the Vatican has tentatively scheduled
the trip for either April or September of next year.
   The magazine quoted an unidentified Vatican source as saying ``it
would have been unjust to punish an entire Christian community ...
for the sole fact that it finds itself living under a morally
reprehensible regime.''
   A summary of the report, scheduled to appear in the magazine's
February issue, was sent to news agencies today.
   A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole, said he was
unaware of any plans for the pontiff to make his first official
visit to the country. The pope has criticized South Africa's
apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   The pontiff made an unscheduled landing in Johannesburg during a
September 1988 trip to southern Africa when foul weather and
mechanical problems diverted his plane. While at the airport, he met
with Foreign Minister Pik Botha.
   The pope is to return to Africa this spring, but he is not
scheduled to visit South Africa.
   In the past, Catholic bishops in South Africa have advised the
pope against visiting the country, whose population of 24 million
includes more than 2 million Catholics.
   But the bishops have recently dropped their opposition, according
to the magazine, which quoted Archbishop of Durban Denis Hurley as
saying: ``The pope must come here soon, (his followers) cannot wait
10 years.''

   Heavy smog fed by burning coal and
automobile exhaust killed at least four people in this western city
last week, according to a heart specialist.
   Ahmet Yalim, a cardiologist at a state hospital in Bursa, was
quoted by the Anatolia News Agency on Friday as saying the hospital
had been treating about 100 people a day for three days for problems
related to the pollution.
   Yalim said four patients with these symptoms died at the hospital.
   Authorities on Wednesday closed schools and banned private cars
from traveling in the city, Turkey's fifth largest.
   Bursa, 90 miles south of Istanbul, has a population of about
800,000 and is a hub for Turkey's auto industry. Anatolia said
wealthy residents with weekend homes outside the city left town to
escape the pollution.

   With the Red Army nearly gone, the
capital's last line of defense is manned by disheveled Afghan
troopers huddled around an armored vehicle, hugging themselves
against the biting cold.
   Half a dozen tanks stand on the treeless, snow-covered terrain to
the right of the soldiers, arranged in a rough semicircle with
cannons pointed north.
   Shivering in their filthy uniforms, the troops stand at the foot
of the vital Salang highway, three miles outside Kabul, with orders
to stop Moslem guerrillas who have isolated the city since the
Soviets left the countryside.
   This final line against the Moslem insurgency that began with a
Commuist coup in 1978 looks as uncertain as the future after Feb.
15, the deadline for the Soviets to end their role in a war they
joined nine years ago.
   Departing Soviet military forces leave behind a regime
stockpiling ammunition for a battle of survival with the guerrillas,
who ring the capital in mountain bases and have rejected proposals
for a political settlement.
   Kabul's daily life is a tableau of war, suffering, fear and
efforts to escape. Amputees hobble in the potholed sreets. Long
lines wait for visas at the Indian Embassy.
   The U.S. Embassy shut its visa section last month after a deluge
of more than 250 applications a day, compared with five a month last
year.
   Food and fuel are scarce because of guerrilla attacks on convoys
along the Salang, making the bitter weather even harder to bear. The
highway connects Kabul to the Soviet border, carrying Red Army
soldiers home and supply convoys south toward the capital.
   Giant Ilyushin 76 transports drop cascades of anti-missile flares
as they climb from the Kabul airport, bound for Moscow with soldiers
and civilian advisers after delivering cargoes of ammunition.
   An average of six planes arrive and depart daily. Hundreds of
fully equipped Soviet troops have been seen boarding them.
   Incoming road convoys roar down the Salang with ammunition as
well as food and fuel.
   North of the Salang Pass toward the border, Soviet troops are
digging in at new positions, diplomats say, apparently to secure the
road for the final withdrawal.
   Workmen in Kabul are felling an avenue of trees and leveling the
ground on either side of a long, wide road that runs from the
Darulaman Palace, headquarters of the Defense Ministry, past the
Soviet Embassy.
   It is wide enough to accommodate smaller Antonov transports and
there is speculation the Soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip.
   Indications are that thousands of Afghans, including supporters
or beneficiaries of the current regime, are trying to slip away or
make arrangements for quick exits.
   Since the U.S. Embassy stopped issuing visas, lines form outside
the embassy of India, the nearest country for those who can afford
air fare.
   Most embassies, down to skeleton staffs with families already
evacuated, have contingency plans to close. The U.S. Embassy has 11
American staff members left and says the question of whether to stay
is ``under constant review.''
   U.N. aid agencies have instructions from headquarters in New York
to withdraw 20 foreign staff by the end of January, leaving just
eight.
   The West German Foreign Ministry on Saturday confirmed that it
had ordered its diplomats to leave Kabul.
   Fur-hatted Soviet troops still man mountainside artillery
emplacements on Kabul's outskirts but have handed over some posts on
the perimeter road.
   Rumors abound, including one that Soviets are about to move part
of their military headquarters from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharaf. That
city is near the Soviet border and, more importantly, on the other
side of the daunting Hindu Kush mountain range.
   Some analysts believe the guerrillas, who have reduced rocket
attacks on the capital, are holding off a major assault to let the
Soviets out.
   President Najib fills his public pronouncements with a blend of
exhortations to fight on and urgings that the guerrillas resume
talks with Kremlin representatives on a political solution.
   ``We will forge ahead and struggle,'' he told a recent gathering
to mark the ninth anniversary of the feared Ministry of State
Security.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in Afghanistan when
withdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed in
Geneva. Half were gone by Aug. 15 and Feb. 15 is the deadline for
all to be withdrawn.

<TEXT>
   Visits to their old battlefields this week
were a blend of tears and cheers, remembrance and reunions for six
former U.S. Marines. One was reminded that a broken toe may have
saved his life.
   Bill Johnson, a 41-year-old maker of electric signs from
Manchester, Conn., wept as he walked through Cam Lo, feeling the
sting of a war he fought more than 20 years ago and the loss of men
who served under him.
   Johnson did not remember Cam Lo as the peaceful village it is
today but as the site of an attack on his squad, part of the 11th
Engineers who cleaned Viet Cong mines from the highways and planted
their own to protect U.S. bases.
   ``Fortunately for me, we had gone on a detail to do some work and
something fell on my foot and broke my toe,'' Johnson said.
   He had to remain in the rear at Dong Ha and another sergeant took
over his squad. They swept Highway 9 west to Cam Lo and stayed
overnight.
   A North Vietnamese battalion attacked Cam Lo that night and the
first rocket-propelled grenades hit the engineer squad's truck,
around which the men were sleeping. It started a fire that burned
some of them to death.
   The 11th Marines were based just below the Demilitarized Zone
that divided North and South Vietnam at the 17th parallel, and five
of the six men in Vietnam now served in the battalion, but none had
ventured into the DMZ until last week.
   ``Ever think you'd be standing here?'' Nate Genna, a 41-year-old
maintenance worker from Boston, asked Gene Spanos, 39, a police
lieutenant in Rosemont, Ill.
   ``No way, brother,'' Spanos replied as they walked across the Ben
Hai bridge that divided the country until victory by the North in
April 1975.
   Escorting them, by an irony of war, was Col. Ho Minh Thanh, who
had tried to kill them a generation earlier by planting land mines
on the highways they traveled.
   Johnson took a picture of his former foe. Spanos asked Thanh to
autograph a map at the point where they were standing, and both
former Marines shook the colonel's hand.
   ``This the guys won't believe,'' Spanos said, and Johnson
commented:
   ``He put them in, we took them out. He was putting in the mines
at night that we were taking out in the morning in the road. That
was his specialty. He said he was good at it. We're glad we were
good at our work or we wouldn't be meeting each other today.''
   Thanh said: ``Both the American people and the Vietnamese people
don't like war. Now we talk. We don't want to fight each other
again. We want to be friends, not enemies.''
   ``I don't feel any bitterness,'' Johnson said. ``Some veterans
may, probably some families who lost a son. If you look at the
reality, these people were hurting as bad as we were. I hope nobody
back in the States looks negatively on our visit here.''
   It was a sad journey for the Marines in many ways, but there were
light moments.
   At the government guest house in Dong Ha where the visitors
stayed, children waited at the gate each day to cheer them as they
left and again as they returned.
   When the Americans left their van to retrace their steps and
reminisce at landmarks they remembered, scores of children followed
as if the men were leading a parade.
   Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from Langdon, Kan., brought a
photo of a Vietnamese woman and her infant son he snapped while
building a road to Con Thien. He asked Col. Thanh if the woman was
still around.
   She was. Thanh knew her well and led Wallace and the others to
her thatched-roof hut in Chau Hau village, just off the dirt road.
   There, Wallace was reunited with Hoan Thi Chit, 56, and her son,
now 25. They smiled and posed for pictures and the son son put his
arm around Wallace.
   The American's biggest surprise, however, came as they left Mrs.
Chit's home. Thanh told the former enemy she had been his top Viet
Cong agent, and both men laughed.

   A British Airways Boeing 757 carrying 82 people
made a safe emergency landing today at Heathrow International
Airport after one of its two engines developed problems in flight,
the airline said.
   ``It landed perfectly safely,'' said British Airways spokeswoman
Linda John. She said the plane, flying from Edinburgh, Scotland to
London, was able to taxi to the boarding ramp under its own power.
Fire engines and ambulances stood by on the runway as a precaution
during the landing.
   British Airways first reported the left-hand engine had been shut
off, but later today it said the engine had only been throttled back
after developing problems it did not detail.
   It was the third emergency landing involving Boeing aircraft
since Thursday. On that day, a Boeing 757 owned by Eastern Airlines
made a safe emergency landing in Atlanta after a wing panel fell off.
   On Friday, a Boeing 737 owned by Piedmont Airlines made a safe
landing after the plane's right engine fell off shortly after
takeoff from Chicago.
   Forty-four people were killed Jan. 8 when a British Midland
Boeing 737 crashed while attempting an emergency landing near
Kegworth, outside London. The pilot had reported engine trouble
before the crash.

   President Bush today took some time away from
the $25 million extravaganza marking his inauguration to try out his
Oval Office chair and to get down to business, declaring that those
holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon will not gain any concessions from
the United States.
   After opening the White House grounds to the public and leading
about 15 people on a tour of his new home, Bush invited his mother,
Dorothy Prescott Bush, and some reporters into the Oval Office where
he amplified some remarks included in his inaugural address Friday.
   Asked whether his plea Friday for assistance in the hostage
matter was an extension of an olive branch to the hostage-holders,
Bush said, ``I want to make clear to them that good will begets good
will. ...
   ``We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans
hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are going to
make concessions in order to free those precious lives,'' Bush said.
   In his inaugural address, Bush had said of the hostages, ``There
are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign
lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be
shown here, and will be long remembered. Good will begets good
will.''
   The day started early, with yet another event marking the
inauguration of the nation's 41st president: The White House grounds
were opened to the public.
   ``This is the people's house and it does seem appropriate on this
first day that we welcome as many as we can,'' Bush said after
spending his first night at the White House.
   The doors opened at 8 a.m. to about 400 people who had waited
through the night outside in temperatures that dropped to the 20s.
   It was the first ``open house'' at the White House in 80 years,
and organizers had expressed concern that the crowd touring the
building would be more restrained than when Andrew Jackson invited
celebrators into the White House at his first inauguration in 1829
and they all but trashed the place.
   Those allowed inside went through the usual security checks, and
once they got in the presidential mansion, they were jovial but
still shivering from the cold they had endured.
   First Lady Barbara Bush joked about how early the tourists had to
come to be the ones selected for the personalized tour, saying,
``They saw us come in last night.''
   The Bushes had spent Friday night stopping in at each of the
galas held to celebrate the inauguration, and had not gotten back to
the White House until 12:45 a.m.
   Asked about her first night in the new home, Mrs. Bush said it
was comfortable, but ``too short.''
   As Bush began his first full day as president, former President
Reagan was back in his home state of California, where he and wife
Nancy were settling into their new home in Bel Air, near Los Angeles.
   Speaking with reporters en route to California, Reagan called the
transfer of power a ``bittersweet experience.''
   ``It was hard to say goodbye,'' he said, but he added that he was
returning ``to a life we did love very much.''
   Bush was equally nostalgic about taking over from the man he had
served as vice president for two terms. ``I was trying to keep the
tears from running down my cheeks. After eight years of friendship,
it was pretty tough,'' Bush said.
   The Bushes made the round of black-tie, invitation-only inaugural
balls into the night. Sixty-thousand Republican party faithful
thronged from Union Station to the Kennedy Center on the banks of
the moonlit Potomac for a night of dancing and carousing.
   At Union Station, the Bushes took a turn on the dance floor, with
the president joking: ``You saw it first here _ a lousy dancer
trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the United
States of America.''
   More partying was store for this evening, including a glitzy
``black tie and boots'' reception thrown by the Texas Society, then
a less-formal dance party featuring performances by rock 'n' roll
and blues stars.
   But amid the festivities there was a grim reminder of the
responsibilities that now rest squarely on Bush's shoulders. From
the moment he was sworn in, a military aide was on call with a
satchel containing the codes necessary to launch a U.S. nuclear
attack. The satchel, which went to the Capitol with Reagan and left
with Bush, is never far away from the president.
   Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, said Bush today would begin
``the routine of being president'' with a national security
briefing, and then would get in some paperwork.
   ``Nothing exciting, but certainly the important day-to-day
routine,'' Sununu said.
   He said Bush also would contact some of his Cabinet nominees, but
that a formal Cabinet meeting is not scheduled until early next
week. The new president plans to conduct some work on Sunday as
well, Sununu said.
   Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle took their oaths of office at
midday Friday under a partly cloudy sky at the West Front of the
Capitol in a ceremony watched by 200,000 people on the Capitol
grounds and by millions more who saw it on television.
   Bush delivered a 20-minute inaugural address that was marked more
by lofty calls for national unity than for specific proposals.
   ``A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom
stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new
action to be taken,'' Bush declared.
   In his vow to devote new attention to the homeless, the
disadvantaged, the forgotten and the drug-addicted, Bush also made
an appeal for political reality in an era of $100 billion-plus
deficits. ``We have more wallet than will; but will is what we
needed,'' he said.
   The Republican president held out a symbolic hand to leaders of
the Democratic-controlled Congress, urging compromise because
Americans ``did not send us here to bicker.''
   In his first official act as president, Bush signed the
nominations of his Cabinet and other top-level members of his infant
administration as well as a proclamation designating Sunday as a
national day of prayer and thanksgiving.
   Bush then went the 1.6 miles down Pennsylvania Avenue to the
White House for the first time as chief executive, riding some of
the way and walking some of the way, hand-in-hand with Barbara at
the head of his inaugural parade.
   Thousands of onlookers lined the route, including Dean Brundage
and Marcia Little of suburban Fairfax, Va., who rode horses into the
city and were rewarded with an unobstructed view. ``You have to be
an NBA center to see over this crowd,'' Brundage said.
   Despite the months of preparation, Bush showed some signs of
still adjusting to his new status. At one point during his
triumphant day, as he was bidding a final farewell to Reagan,
Barbara Bush had to nudge him to remind him that from now he is the
one who answers to ``Mr. President.''

<BYLINE>40 Years Later, Beijing Residents Remember Surrender</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio stations broadcast the news 40 years ago
Sunday to anxious Beijing residents: the city's Nationalist
officials had surrendered peacefully and a long Communist siege was
over.
   She Diqing, now 71, remembers the day well. The announcement
meant his imminent release from jail in Beijing for his underground
Communist work.
   Historian Wang Huilin is less sure of the dates but remembers
clearly getting the news. He and friends, then students, ran into
the streets and sang songs of celebration.
   From a military standpoint, Beijing's surrender Jan. 22, 1949 was
anticlimactic. After more than three years of civil war, the rest of
northeastern China already was in Communist hands. Communist troops
had surrounded the ancient walled city since Dec. 13.
   Gen. Fu Zuoyi, Beijing's Nationalist commander, had no line of
retreat and no chance of relief from Nationalist leader Chiang
Kai-shek's forces in the south.
   For Beijing's 2 million residents, the surrender meant the end to
waiting and wondering whether the proud Fu, one of the Nationalists'
most able generals, would choose to make a stand.
   ``It was a very dismal, difficult time. We never knew whether
there would be violence or not,'' Derek Bodde, professor emeritus of
Oriental studies at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a
telephone interview. Bodde was in Beijing during the siege, busy
translating a history of Chinese philosophy, and remembers filling
his bathtub with water each day because water supplies often were
cut.
   Wang, who in 1949 was a student at Beijing Normal University and
now teaches history there, remembers food supplies also were tight.
   ``Classes went on as usual. But everyone wanted a peaceful
surrender. Aside from the possible loss of life, Beijing held so
many ancient relics that would have been destroyed in a battle,'' he
said.
   The relics were part of Beijing's mystique as China's capital for
centuries. The Nationalists made their capital in Nanking, to the
south, but the Communists planned to restore Beijing's status and
did not want to destroy the city first.
   Beijing city officials have commemorated the fateful weeks in
1949 by issuing three books of photographs, reminiscences and
documents.
   She, now retired from a top position in Beijing's postwar
government and a contributor to the books, recalled his work as an
underground Communist organizer.
   Even before the siege began, he said, he sent envoys to persuade
Fu to surrender, starting with Fu's daughter, a member of the
pro-Communist Democratic Youth Alliance that She headed.
   ``We feared that if we picked someone else to talk to Fu, he
might be angry and kill the messenger,'' She said. ``But we figured
if we picked his daughter, he might be unhappy but he wouldn't do
anything.''
   Several weeks later, She was arrested by Nationalist forces and
spent the last 22 days before the surrender in jail.
   W. Allyn Rickett, then a student at Beijing's Qinghua University
outside the city wall, watched events from a different perspective.
   Nationalist troops had set up an artillery unit on campus, said
Rickett, now retired as a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania.
   ``But on the night of the 13th, the Nationalists withdrew and the
Communist forces went past the university and set up their lines
around Beijing,'' he recalled in a phone conversation. The two sides
dug into defensive positions in the arid winter landscape, trading
occasional cannon volleys.
   Rickett said he crossed Communist and Nationalist lines twice to
enter Beijing and found a city crowded with refugee students whom
the Nationalists had evacuated from other cities. They camped in
parks and ancient temples.
   ``The place was loaded with troops and trucks rushing around.
There were a lot of accidents,'' he said. Soldiers patrolled the
dark streets at night to enforce a curfew.
   ``You couldn't see them and they couldn't see you,'' Rickett
said. ``I'd go along with a flashlight in my face to show I was a
foreigner. Sometimes that got me by, sometimes I got yelled at.''
   Fu, meanwhile, paced the floor of his study in Beijing's former
imperial palace and debated what to do, Major Gen. Zhou Beifeng, his
former aide, wrote in the latest edition of Outlook Weekly magazine.
   Zhou said Fu's hestitation lost him the chance to peacefully give
up the nearby city of Tianjin, which he also commanded. Communists
finally attacked on Jan. 14, and history books say 130,000 defenders
were killed.
   Tianjin's fall was the last straw. Fu surrendered a week later
and the grateful Communists made him minister of conservation. He
died in 1974.

   A cargo ship carrying logs from
Malaysia to South Korea caught fire, and six of its 21 crew members
were seriously burned trying to put out the flames, officials said
Saturday.
   Lt. Francisco Mendoza, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the
3,768-ton Cattleya issued a distress call Thursday while it was in
the Luzon Sea off Zambales province, about 100 miles of Manila.
   Eduardo Mendoza, operations manager of the ship's local agent,
said reports from crew members indicated the fire started in the
ship's engine room. He said the extent of damage was not known and
that the cause of the fire was under investigation.
   The 21 Korean crew members managed to put out the fire but six of
them were seriously burned, he said.
   Another ship picked up the wounded men, who were then airlifted
to a hospital.
   The rest of the crew members stayed with the ship, which was
towed to Manila.

   Despite scattered violence, millions of
people voted in three federally-ruled states today in balloting that
tested Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's popularity before national
elections later this year.
   Officials suspended the voting in the state of Nagaland after
clashes between rival groups left three people injured, election
officials said.
   Authorities also reported minor clashes but no casualties in
populous Tamil Nadu, an especially important state for Gandhi's
fortures.
   Nevertheless, election officials reported heavy turnout in all
three states after eight hours of voting for state assemblies came
to a close.
   The voting will lead to a restoration of local rule.
   An estimated 75 percent of 600,000 eligible voters in Nagaland
and about 75 percent of 300,000 eligible voters in Mizoram state
cast ballots. An estimated 55 percent of 36 million eligible voters
in Tamil Nadu went to the polls, the officials said. Results were
expected to be released Sunday.
   The federal government imposed its own rule last year after
political crises in Mizoram and Nagaland, sparsely populated
northeastern states, and Tamil Nadu in the south.
   Indian law allows the federal government to dismiss a state
government and impose its control if there is no clear majority in
the legislature. A state may be kept under federal rule up to one
year.
   Today's state assembly elections also were important for Gandhi
and his governing Congress Party. Gandhi made nine trips across
Tamil Nadu since September in an uphill battle to win a victory for
his party.
   Gandhi, who must call national parliamentary elections by
December, has been considering early elections if his party wins in
Tamil Nadu.
   A loss, however, could rule out such a move and give the
newly-formed opposition People's Party nearly a year to organize.
The new party is a coalition trying to unite behind V.P. Singh, a
former Gandhi ally who is planning to challenge the prime minister
in the general election.
   The Congress Party, which has enjoyed almost uninterrupted
control of India in the 41 years since independence, has not held
power in Tamil Nadu since 1967. Pre-election opinion polls showed
the Congress Party trailing Muthuvel Karunanidhi and his Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam Party, which was expected to win about 120 of the
234 state assembly seats. Karunanidhi is backed by Singh.
   Karunanidhi served as Tamil Nadu chief minister from 1967 to 1976
when he lost to M.G. Ramachandran, a popular actor who turned to
politics.
   The Indian Constitution says the leader of the largest party
should become prime minister. If he is not already sitting in the
legislature, he must seek election within six months.
   Ramachandran ruled Tamil Nadu for 10 years until he died in
December 1987. His death split his once-massive party into two
factions _ one led by 64-year-old wife, Janaki, and the other by his
leading lady on and off screen, Jayalalitha Jayaram.
   Ms. Jayaram, 42, claims the late chief minister secretly married
her and insists she is his political heir. She made the claim of the
secret marriage after Ramachandran died.
   Gandhi's party has not designated anyone to be chief minister if
it wins.
   Sixty seats were at stake in Nagaland, a remote hilly state
bordering China. Forty seats were being contested in Mizoram. Both
states have a history of insurgency and tribal unrest.

   Pork rinds? They're loaded with cholesterol,
salt and fat. But they crunch pleasingly and explode on the palate
with delight before dissolving into a light, bacon-flavored residue.
And President Bush loves them.
   He was introduced to the crispy tan strips during his days as an
oilman in West Texas. After a tough day in the oil fields, pork
rinds, washed down with a cold beer, seems like a food of kings _ or
of presidents.
   So when Bush left Texas for the political wars of Washington, he
carried with him a continuing yen for them.
   But a diet laced with pork rinds, say nutrition experts, is bad
news for a guy with a job like George Bush's.
   ``This is an appropriate snack for somebody who is doing a lot of
manual labor _ an agricultural worker, a guy working on the chain
gang, or building railroads,'' said Dr. Wayne Callaway, an associate
clinical professor of nutrition at George Washington University.
``Where they are burning up to 4,000 calories a day and sweating a
lot, this would be fine.''
   How about an executive who spends most of his time at the desk?
   ``As a general snack, it's not a good idea,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I think once a year would be fine.''
   According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis, a
two-ounce package of pork rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of
protein; 18.9 grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol, and 1,054
milligrams of sodium.
   In effect, a small package of the hog chips has 20 percent more
calories, almost twice the fat and double the sodium of a typical
fast-food hamburger. But the snack also has almost three times more
protein than the burger.
   The fat, cholesterol and sodium, says Callaway, make pork rinds
an unhealthy addition to a typical American diet that already is
high in those elements. He said jelly beans, the treat preferred by
former President Reagan, are a much more healthy snack.
   ``On the other hand,'' Callaway added, ``if Mr. Bush had a
cholesterol of 165 ... and was otherwise healthy and was eating this
stuff all day long, then I wouldn't make a big to do about it.''
   According to his staff, President Bush's cholesterol count is 192
_ well above the pork rind safety limit suggested by Callaway.
   Bush is so fond of the fried pig skin that in his primary
campaign last April he stopped in Lima, Ohio, and met with the
president of Rudolph Foods Co., one of the nation's top pork rind
processors.
   ``He said he learned about (pork rinds) in Texas,'' said John E.
Rudolph, the food company president. ``He told me, `I eat the heck
out of these things.' ''
   But the president is not alone in his craving for fried hog hide.
   ``Pork rinds are a $200 million part of the $6 billion snack food
market,'' said Rudolph. ``They're just a little less popular than
pretzels, but they're crawling ahead by 4 to 5 percent a year.''
   Rudolph's company produces both the finished product and the
partially-prepared ``pellet'' that other companies ``pop'' into the
snack food.
   Rudolph believes pork rinds originated decades ago in Mexico. He
and his company modernized the technique and spent the last 33 years
trying to sell the product to a skeptical world.
   Pork rinds start with raw, fresh hog hides delivered to the Lima
plant. The skins are cut into one-inch squares and smoke-cured like
bacon. Then they are rendered, a process that extracts grease and
moisture and shrivels the strips into hard kernels called
``pellets.''
   To ``pop'' the pellets into the final porcine delicacy, they are
placed into oil heated to 400 degrees and deep fried. Finally, the
rinds are salted _ generously _ and packaged, usually in two-ounce
snack bags.

   Nearly a decade and a half after Richard M.
Nixon, a distraught former president beset by the past, flew home to
California, another former president has followed in his path _
serene, popular and proclaiming that he looks to the future as he
nears his 78th birthday.
   The contrasts between Nixon and Ronald Reagan were inescapable as
Reagan flew west after George Bush's inauguration Friday. Reagan
left Washington declaring that it was ``very pleasant living'' in
the White House but there are ``a lot of things yet to be done''
outside of it.
   Nixon, driven to resignation by the Watergate scandal, took off
by helicopter from the South Lawn of the White House on Aug. 9,
1974, and was aboard an Air Force jet to his native state by the
time Gerald Ford was sworn in to succeed him.
   Reagan, whose own administration was plunged into turmoil by the
Iran-Contra affair he professes not yet to understand, sat by
benignly on the Capitol's western porch as Bush took the oath of
office. Then he boarded a helicopter for the eight-minute flight to
Andrews Air Force Base and the same jet trip west.
   Nixon, born and raised in California, called his departure from
Washington ``the nightmare ending of a long dream.''
   Reagan, a Midwesterner who adopted California as his home, said
the journey back there for him and former first lady Nancy Reagan
was ``a return to a life we did love very much.''
   Nixon went to an exile of seclusion and silence _ first in
California, then in New York, then in New Jersey _ only recently
emerging to proclaim his views in books, articles and public
appearances.
   Reagan said he will quickly be ``out on the mash potato circuit''
pushing his proposals for budgetary and electoral reform.
   Asked what he would miss most about Washington, he said, ``I
haven't tried (thinking about) that; it was very pleasant living
there...''
   As to what they would like most about their new life, he said,
``Well, because it will be a return to a life we did love very much.
California isn't a place in my mind, it's a way of life, so that is
the sweet part of the bittersweet experience.''
   Reagan often conferred with Nixon while in office and once said
that as fellow Californians they had a ``closer bond'' than he
enjoyed with former presidents Carter or Ford.
   Nevertheless the two men's attitudes toward past and future seem
to differ greatly.
   Nixon, 61 when he left office, asked diplomat Vernon Walters some
months later, ``What did I do wrong?''
   If there is any such soul searching in Reagan, he does not show
it.
   The circumstances of his departure as the first president since
Dwight Eisenhower to complete two terms are, of course, immeasurably
happier.
   Still, the stark contrasts stand out. In his farewell to his
staff in the East Room, Nixon said, ``Always remember, others may
hate you _ but those who hate you don't win, unless you hate them.''
   In Reagan's East Room farewell, as in Nixon's, there were tears
aplenty. But no talk of hate.
   On his helicopter flight to Andrews, Nixon leaned his head back
against his seat back and closed his eyes and heard his wife, Pat,
murmur, ``It's so sad. It's so sad.''
   Reagan, asked as he jetted back west if he was sad, happy or
relieved, replied, ``There are elements of all that, yes.''

<HEAD>Bundy's Crimes Left Deep Mark On Florida</HEAD>

   Ted Bundy's grisly sex crimes 11 years
ago galvanized support for the death penalty in Florida and left
their mark on the political landscape.
   ``There'll be a celebration when he dies,'' said Gerald Witt,
mayor of the North Florida community of Lake City, home of Bundy's
final victim, 12-yearold Kimberly Leach. ``He has such a terrible
criminal record, it's just impossible to have any sympathy for him.''
   Although Bundy's scheduled execution Tuesday is for Kimberly's
1978 murder, he also received a death sentence for strangling two
students in their beds in a 1978 rampage at a Florida State
University sorority house in Tallahassee. Two other women were
critically injured.
   The law school dropout also was suspected in the sex-related
deaths of up to three dozen women in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Utah
and Colorado.
   As his execution date approached, Bundy began confessing to some
of those slayings, said a prosecutor who befriended him. ``Murders
are being solved,'' Volusia County State Attorney John Tanner told
The Orlando Sentinel late Friday.
   At a 1987 competency hearing, U.S. District Judge Kendall Sharp
called Bundy ``probably the most competent serial killer in the
country at this time ... a diabolical genius.''
   ``This is not one of those cases where death penalty opponents
are going to have much luck rallying public sympathy to their
cause,'' said Jon Peck, spokesman for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
``We have not heard from Amnesty International for a change.''
   Bundy became part of the state's 1986 gubernatorial race when a
hard-hitting television commercial for Martinez said Democrat Steve
Pajcic ``voted to weaken the death penalty for killers like Ted
Bundy.''
   Although some found the commercial distasteful, its effects were
devastating to Pajcic, who lost the election largely on the
law-and-order issue.
   ``It is an issue that resonates very deeply in this state,''
Steven Craig, a political science professor at the University of
Florida, said during the campaign. ``Everybody knows who Ted Bundy
is.''
   Political experts generally agreed that Democrat Michael Dukakis'
presidential aspirations also were crippled in Florida by his
opposition to the death penalty. Dukakis received just 38 percent of
the Florida vote in November.
   State officials and death penalty supporters complain that Bundy
escaped three earlier death warrants through legal maneuverings.
   On one of those occasions, Bundy, 42, whose case was depicted in
the TV miniseries ``The Deliberate Stranger,'' came within seven
hours of execution Nov. 17, 1986, before a federal appeals court
ordered a competency hearing.
   ``That man has been living off the taxpayers for 10, 11 years,
and it reflects badly on the judicial system,'' the mayor said.
``People begin to wonder if there is such a thing as criminal
justice any longer because of so many postponements.''
   When the Legislature passed a law in 1986 requiring automobile
passengers to buckle their seat belts, hordes of bumper stickers
appeared that read: ``I'll Buckle Up When Bundy Does _ It's the
Law.''
   ``It makes a mockery of our judicial system every day that Ted
Bundy continues to live,'' said State Attorney Jerry Blair, who won
a conviction in the Leach case. ``People are virtually up in arms
about this, and every day that justice is delayed, justice is either
denied or at least diminished.''
   Nineteen people have been executed in Florida since the death
penalty was restored in 1976, but none has attracted as much
attention as Bundy.
   Hundreds of calls have poured in from editors and reporters from
around the country who want to cover the execution. The Department
of Corrections has received scores of calls from people hoping to
land one of a dozen seats available to the public for witnessing the
execution.
   ``We've had an average of 30 calls a day from people wanting to
be witnesses,'' said Carrie Flack, an administrative assistant.
``There is no comparison. We normally get three or four requests on
an individual inmate, normally from law enforcement.''

<HEAD>JFK-Khrushchev Missile Crisis Letters Still Under Wraps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is refusing to unseal a
26-year-old correspondence between President Kennedy and Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev concerning the Cuban missile crisis,
despite requests from scholars who say officials in Moscow are
``thrilled'' by the idea.
   The 11 classified letters exchanged in 1962 following the Cuban
confrontation remain ``extremely sensitive ... from the national
security point of view,'' said Pratt Byrd of the department's
freedom of information office.
   Scholars had hoped for the release of the letters in time for a
conference in Moscow next weekend featuring for the first time _ and
most likely the last _ missile crisis participants from the United
States, Cuba and the Soviet Union.
   ``There'll never be a group able to discuss these letters like
this group ever again,'' scholar James G. Blight said in a telephone
interview last week.
   ``Some of the co-authors of these letters will be in the room,''
said Blight, assistant director of the Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government.
   He said scholars are anxious to learn ``what was said so often
and so deeply felt, because this was supposed to be regarded by both
men as absolutely private.''
   The missile crisis flared in October 1962 when an American U-2
spy plane spotted construction of Soviet medium-range ballistic
missile sites in Cuba. Kennedy responded with a naval blockade.
   Many believe the confrontation brought the superpowers to the
brink of war. It ended when Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles
in exchange for U.S. guarantees that Cuba would not be invaded.
   Blight, who recently published a book on the missile crisis and
helped set up the Moscow conference, said Soviet leaders were
enthusiastic about the idea of releasing the letters.
   ``The Soviets were thrilled by this idea,'' Blight said. Mikhail
Gorbachev ``absolutely would have gone along with it,'' he said.
``There's no doubt in my mind.''
   Aleksander Alekseev, Soviet ambassador to Cuba at the time of the
crisis, urged Kremlin leaders to allow release of the letters. Other
``people very close to Gorbachev and the Central Committee'' also
embraced the idea, he said.
   But Blight said the Soviets would not release the correspondence
without the State Department approval.
   The John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, spurred by researchers at
the Kennedy School who helped set up the Moscow conference,
requested in November that all 11 documents be reviewed for release.
Previous requests by the library on behalf of individual scholars
have been rejected.
   The State Department has not announced its decision to the school
or library. But Byrd said Secretary of State George Shultz told Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., in a letter and a telephone conversation
last month that the documents would remain sealed. Kennedy had been
working on behalf of the school to have the documents declassified.
   Kennedy aide Paul Donovan said discussions between Shultz and the
senator were private and that Kennedy would not release his
correspondence with the secretary of state.
   The world leaders exchanged 22 letters between Oct. 22 and Dec.
14 concerning the missile crisis, according to Suzanne Forbes, an
archivist at the Kennedy Library in Boston.
   Ten of the letters were declassified in 1973 by the State
Department and the 11th was released in 1979, she said. The
remaining letters, written by both men from Oct. 30 through Dec. 14,
have remained sealed at the Boston library despite periodic requests
by the library on behalf of scholars to have them released.
   Blight expressed skepticism about the ``national security''
reason for keeping the letters classified.
   ``The Americans who saw it at the time say there's nothing
embarrassing (and poses) no national security risks,'' said Blight.
   He said the reason may be that world leaders may be reluctant to
have frank correspondence if they fear the documents might be
released later.
   Blight also suggested that the State Department may fear setting
a precedent.
   ``Rather than the (missile crisis) correspondence being the
problem, it would be the precedent of opening up sensitive material
related to the U.S.-Cuban-Soviet relationship as a continuing
problem,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A woman and her former boyfriend have been
arrested on charges of plotting the murder of the woman's
millionaire husband in order to collect more than $500,000 in life
insurance.
   Debra Hartmann, 36, was arrested Friday by federal and state
agents at her Deerfield home, authorities said.
   Also charged were former tennis pro John Scott Korabik Jr., 33,
who was arrested outside his Chicago home, and Kenneth Kaenel, 56,
an acquaintance of the couple.
   They were indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on charges of
mail fraud and conspiracy.
   Werner J. Hartmann, 38, who owned a suburban Franklin Park car
stereo company, was shot to death in the bathroom of his north
suburban Northbrook home on June 8, 1982, according to police.
   The indictment alleged that Mrs. Hartmann and Korabik began
planning in 1981 to have her husband killed. They are accused of
enlisting Kaenel's help and giving him weapons.
   Authorities said investigators recovered three bullets from a gun
found in Kaenel's basement and that ballistics tests matched the
bullets with those fired into Hartmann.
   The indictment said that, in addition to collecting $587,940 from
two insurance companies, Mrs. Hartmann also inherited her husband's
businesses and property.
   A fourth person, insurance broker Harvey L. Loochtan, was charged
with fraud and accepting an unspecified bribe in connection with the
alleged forgeries of an insurance policy and an application for
insurance.
   Loochtan surrendered Friday, pleaded guilty to two counts of mail
fraud and was released pending sentencing. Authorities said he is
expected to testify as a government witness.
   Mrs. Hartmann was released late Friday on $250,000 bond. Korabik
was freed on $150,000 bond. Kaenel is already in federal prison on
unrelated gun charges.
   Nearly a year ago in an affidavit filed by a federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent James DeLorto, it was disclosed
that Mrs. Hartmann, Korabik and Kaenel were suspected of plotting
Hartmann's death.

   A 16-year-old who told authorities he was
forced to chauffeur two prison escapees on an 11-day crime spree
says the 4,000-mile odyssey taught him how to protect himself from
being a victim again.
   ``I've learned how criminals look at the world. They look for
people who are by themselves, who flaunt things,'' Ted Siegel said
as he returned to school Friday for the first time since he
disappeared Jan. 3.
   He also learned how to navigate in New York City, where he said
the three got lost in a snowstorm and walked 80 blocks trying to
find his car.
   ``I'd never driven in New York,'' Siegel said. ``You've got to
watch out for the taxis.''
   Siegel told investigators that Patrick Paige, 21, of Ocala, and
Anthony James Cokley, 23, of St. Petersburg, forced him to drive
them up and down the East Coast because neither knew how to drive
his stick-shift car.
   Siegel disappeared near his family's Marion County horse farm
Jan. 3, the same morning Paige and Cokley escaped from the Marion
Correctional Institution at Lowell.
   Siegel was released in Baltimore on Jan. 14 after the two men
bought a used car, with an automatic transmission, with money from
six burglaries and three strong-arm robberies, the FBI said.
   The escapees were arrested Wednesday near Salt Lake City, and on
Friday a federal magistrate in Utah ordered them returned to Florida
for a preliminary hearing on federal escape, kidnapping and auto
theft charges.
   Siegel is glad the experience is over.
   ``I just want to get this all behind me,'' he said. ``Maybe
someday I'll write a book about this whole experience.''

<HEAD>Bush Says US Won't `Make Concessions' To Gain Hostages' Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: SUBS 5th graf bgng ``His comment ... '' to DELETE extraneous

<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, getting swiftly down to work,
sent a fresh signal today to the powers holding nine Americans
captive in the Middle East, suggesting that the hostages' release
would engender a comparable act of good will from the United States.
   The new president greeted tourists visiting the White House, sent
a letter to Congress asking to address a joint session on Feb. 9,
welcomed a letter of congratulations from the Kremlin and met with
reporters during his first visit to the Oval Office.
   With his mother, Dorothy Prescott Bush, seated at his side, Bush
said he hoped a plea for assistance in the hostage matter in his
inaugural speech ``was heard around the world.''
   ``I want to make clear to them that good will begets good will,''
he said when asked whether he was extending an olive branch to the
hostage-holders.
   His comment echoed what he said Friday in his inaugural address
in a clear appeal to Iran for help: ``There are today Americans who
are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are
unaccoaunted for. Assistance can be shown here, and will be long
remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral
that endlessly moves on.''
   At the same time, Bush said the United States will not make
concessions in an effort to free the U.S. hostages, some held for
nearly four years.
   Refusing to indicate that any Middle East nation was responsible
for holding the hostages, Bush said, ``We keep hearing rumors that
countries want to have improved relations with the United States.
But you can't finger any one country for holding hostages agaisnt
their will.''
   He added: ``We are not going to escalate the currency of holding
Americans hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are
going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives.''
   Bush said he planned to respond to ``a generous letter'' from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Gorbachev letter was handed to Bush on Capitol Hill shortly
after his swearing-in ceremony. In it, the Soviet leader told Bush
that the two superpowers have a chance to ``bring closer the
solution of the most painful problems of the present time, above all
those connected with the need to eliminate the threat of war.''
   Gorbachev congratulated Bush on his new job and said he hoped
that Bush's tenure ``will be marked by the stable and diverse
development of relations between our countries'' and added that the
Soviet Union ``is prepared to work in this direction.''
   Later in the morning, Bush sent a letter to the bipartisan
leadership of Congress, inviting them to meet with him Tuesday at
the White House to discuss the nation's deficit and its foreign
policy. He asked for the opportunity to address a joint session of
the Congress on Thursday, Feb. 9.
   ``Let me say how much I look forward to our working together on
these critical issues,'' Bush wrote, according to a text released by
the White House. ``I am sure the American people expect that
conserns of such national import should be tackled in a spirit of
bipartisan cooperation, and am hopeful that we may prove worthy of
the confidence they place in us.''
   Asked for his reaction to being in the Oval Office for the first
time, Bush grinned and said, ``It's wonderful. I can't wait to get
to work. I really feels wonderful.''
   Bush also read the note that Reagan had left him for in his Oval
Office desk, handwritten on a notepad with the inscription, ``Don't
let the turkeys get you down.''
   ``You'll have moments when you'll want to use this particular
stationary, well, go to it,'' Bush quoted Reagan as writing.
   Bush also marked his first full day in office by welcoming
America to ``the people's house,'' opening the grounds of the White
House and leading a tour for a few of the many who were waiting in
the icy morning chill.
   The president, with first lady Barbara Bush at his side, came
outside below the south porch of the White House _ not usually a
tourist entrance _ to welcome about 400 people waiting for a free
public tour of the presidential mansion.
   ``This is the people's house and it does seem appropriate on this
first day that we welcome as many as we can,'' Bush said.
   While thousands more people waited their turns to enter the White
House grounds, a randomly selected group of about 15 visitors was
personally escorted by Bush on a tour of the historic house.
   Bush left the tour, saying he had to begin some presidential
paperwork, ``to sign one or two things.''
   Dozens of people waited outside the White House grounds most of
the night for the public tour, which came after the Bushes had a
busy evening of inaugural ball-hopping.
   Bush took the oath of office at noon Friday in a chilly ceremony
watched by 200,000 on Capitol Hill and by millions of television
viewers around the world.
   Bush was also attending a lunch at the State Department honoring
the finance committee that raised more than $25 million for these
inaugural festivities, and was heading out again tonight to a Texas
``Black Tie and Boots'' party and another affair for young Americans.
   Bush, who has often joked that he has Martin Van Buren to thank
for his example of being the last vice president elected directly to
the presidency, may have Van Buren to blame for the black tie ordeal
he endured Friday night.
   Van Buren in 1837 became the first chief executive to hold two
inaugural balls, and he offended supporters by only attending the
higher-priced affair. Since then, no president has passed up any
official ball, even as they mushroomed from five in John F.
Kennedy's time to nine at Ronald Reagan's second inauguration.
   This time, there were 11 official balls, with separate overflow
balls at three sites, and a stop at a Congressional Medal of Honor
winners' banquet, making 15 stops in all for Bush.
   Bush made no bones that dancing is not his favorite pastime.
   Bush, who began the eventful day by rising at 6 a.m. in Blair
House, didn't get home to the White House until 12:45 a.m., more
than 4{ hours after he and Barbara began the party rounds. They
danced cheek-to-cheek at five balls, but although the bands played
``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' they never did more than a few
turns.

<HEAD>West Germany Pulls Diplomats From Kabul; Soviet Airlifts Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's diplomatic staff left
Kabul on Saturday under orders from the Bonn government, and Tass
said the Soviet Union began an airlift of emergency food supplies to
this beleaguered capital.
   The West German Foreign Ministry said it told its three diplomats
in Kabul to leave because of fears of worsening economic conditions
and increased violence as Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan and its
civil war.
   Juergen Chrobog, chief ministry spokesman, said the diplomats and
their families left the city Saturday. He said the embassy would
function ``on a reduced status'' with a small local staff.
   Western diplomatic sources in Kabul, however, said the embassy
was closed. That would make it the first foreign mission in Kabul to
shut down amid concerns about an economic blockade and possible
blood bath following the Red Army's departure.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the West
Germans left on a flight for New Delhi with no prior announcement.
   ``We intend to watch developments there carefully before making a
decision on when to return,'' Chrobog said.
   Other Western embassies say they are reviewing their positions
now that it appears the Soviets will meet a Feb. 15 deadline for
removal of their troops from Afghanistan, where they have been
helping government troops fight Moslem guerrillas since December
1979.
   The British Embassy last week told Britons and nationals of six
other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibility to leave.
The U.S. Embassy has 11 American staff members in Kabul and says the
question of whether to stay is ``under constant review.''
   Kabul has been increasingly tense as the withdrawal date for the
remaining 50,000 Soviet soldiers approaches and guerrillas close in.
Food prices have doubled in recent weeks. Civilians, including young
children, stand in bread lines for hours in 20-degree temperatures.
   Guerrilla disruptions of convoys of food and supplies, including
ammunition, have increased as Soviet troops hand over escort duties
and positions to government units along the key Salang highway from
the Soviet border. Bad weather also has held up convoys.
   Saturday's English-language Tass report mentioned ``significant
shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition
(guerrillas) to organize an economic blockade of the city.'' It
accused some Kabul traders of engaging in ``open sabotage'' by
hoarding food.
   The official Soviet news agency reported from Kabul that a
3,500-ton airlift of food began Friday. Tass said six flights
arrived Saturday in Kabul with flour and other food supplies.
   U.N. aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged
similar help from Western nations, which refuse to deal with the
pro-Marxist government of President Najib.
   ``We're very pleased. This is a beginning,'' said Vincent
O'Reilly, head of UNICEF in Kabul.
   ``We've heard reports of children dying (from cold) in the bread
queues and we're very concerned about the dangers of increased
malnutrition ... This is a humanitarian, not a political issue, and
the West should help too.''

   Jessica Hahn says she found it difficult
to return to the South, the heart of the PTL television ministry
constituency, but came anyway to help promote a car show.
   ``In this part of the country, I didn't know if I was going to
get kicked or kissed,'' said Ms. Hahn, whose sexual encounter with
PTL founder Jim Bakker helped lead to the downfall of the
evangelical empire.
   Signs such as ``Jessica is a Disgrace to All Women,'' which
greeted the former church secretary upon her arrival Friday at the
Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, no longer bother her, she said.
   ``When you get Jessica Hahn, you get controversy. Some people
like me, and some people don't,'' she said.
   At a promotional appearance for the Spartanburg car show, Ms.
Hahn was a guest on an Anderson radio station show Friday night.
Station officials said they offered her a permanent spot after
listeners overwhelmingly said they enjoyed her.
   Since leaving her job as an on-air personality for a Phoenix
radio station Dec. 31, Ms. Hahn said she has received about 130
offers from other stations around the country. She said she would
sift through the offers and make a decision in the next few weeks.

   A local NAACP official, who has criticized
Arsenio Hall for failing to hire more blacks for his new late-night
talk show, has filed a $10 million libel suit against the black
actor-comedian.
   Willis Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
claimed in the lawsuit filed Friday in Superior Court that Hall
defamed him by accusing him of extortion during a radio talk show
earlier this month.
   According to Edwards' lawsuit, Hall claimed Edwards had sought
$40,000 to prevent him from publicizing Hall's alleged failure to
hire black writers, directors or producers for his new syndicated
show, ``The Arsenio Hall Show.''
   Hall's comments were ``for the sole purposes of defaming Edwards
and the NAACP,'' Edwards' lawsuit alleges.
   Bob Wachs, a Hall manager, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He
said his client, who formerly was a guest host of Fox Broadcasting
Co.'s ``The Late Show,'' had not been served with the legal papers.
   The Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP also has criticized Michael
Jackson and Lionel Richie on similar grounds, saying the black
singers employed few blacks in administrative positions on their
staffs.

   Pat Sajak, host of CBS' first entry in the
late-night talk show field in 17 years, beat out Johnny Carson of
NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' in the Nielsen ratings in Sajak's debut
week.
   The ratings are subject to some interpretation because ``The Pat
Sajak Show,'' which made its debut Monday, Jan. 9, runs 90 minutes,
half an hour longer than Carson's show. The last half-hour of
Sajak's show competes against ``Late Night With David Letterman'' on
NBC.
   Sajak got a first-week rating of 5.3 and a share of 21 percent of
the audience for all 90 minutes. The combined rating for Carson and
Letterman was 4.7 with a 17 share.
   During just the hour Sajak and ``The Tonight Show'' were against
each other, Sajak got a 6.1 rating and ``Tonight'' got 5.3. However,
Carson appeared on only three shows. Jay Leno was the substitute
host Monday night and Tuesday was a rerun.
   An NBC official, who asked not to be identified, said the network
was not concerned by the ratings loss. The official said Sajak got a
lot of first-week sampling, including viewers who normally would
watch cable or independent stations.
   Each ratings point equals 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of the sets in use.

   Pop star Boy George says he'd like to have a baby,
but out of wedlock.
   ``I'd love to have a child but I don't think I would be allowed
to adopt, although I would make a fine parent,'' the singer said on
the ``Desert Island Discs'' radio program broadcast Saturday by the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   Asked if his paternal urges meant he might settle down to married
life, the 27-year-old singer said, ``I don't think you have to get
married to have a child, just give it some sort of stable life,
that's all.''
   Boy George said his life has become more settled in the 2{ years
since he said he had beaten a heroin addiction. He said he works out
with an exercise instructor every day at his Gothic-style mansion in
north London, and eats a diet of whole grains, lentils, root
vegetables and white fish.

   Actor Richard Dreyfuss and Tri-Star Pictures
Inc. have settled a lawsuit the actor filed after the production
company halted filming of the movie ``Fifty.''
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Dreyfuss' lawsuit,
filed in December, sought a $3.5 million advance the actor said his
contract called for as well as an admission from Tri-Star that he
was not to blame for it ending production of the film.
   Richard Grant, a Dreyfuss spokesman, said the 41-year-old actor
was out of the country and unavailable for comment.
   In a statement issued Thursday, Tri-Star President David Matalon
said, ``Mr. Dreyfuss was not to blame for Tri-Star's decision to
discontinue production of `Fifty.'''
   The studio still faces a lawsuit filed earlier this month by Mark
Rydell, who was to have directed ``Fifty.''
   Rydell's $2 million suit claims the director ``believes that
Tri-Star harbored a desire to cancel production of the picture prior
to Dec. 12, when it actually abandoned production.''

   Character actress Norma Varden,
whose lengthy stage, television and film career included such roles
as comedian Jack Benny's mother and the housekeeper in ``The Sound
of Music,'' has died at age 90.
   Miss Varden died Thursday of heart failure at Cottage Hospital's
coronary care unit, nurse Kathy Polischuk said Saturday. She had
moved to this coastal city 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles in 1969.
   She began making movies in the early 1930s in her native England.
Among her English films were ``East Meets West,'' ``The Student's
Romance,'' ``The Iron Duke'' and ``Fire Over England.''
   The movies led to offers from Hollywood, where she appeared in
some of the biggest hit movies of the time.
   Among her credits were ``Random Harvest,'' ``The White Cliffs of
Dover,'' ``National Velvet'' and ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''
   In addition to her ``Sound of Music'' role, she played the murder
victim in ``Witness for the Prosecution.'' And she was the woman
whose husband's pocket was picked in the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid
Bergman classic ``Casablanca.''
   Turning to television, Miss Varden was Benny's mother on ``The
Jack Benny Show'' in the 1950s.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete, a Wech-Ryce-Haider Funeral
Chapel spokeswoman said Saturday.

<HEAD>British Conduct in Palestine Alarmed Government 50 Years Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British officials frequently expressed alarm at
their security forces' behavior during an Arab rebellion in
Palestine 50 years ago, but they did little to curb the excesses,
newly declassified documents show.
   The Independent newspaper, which sifted through the government
files, said Saturday they showed ``ministers refused to curb the
atrocities and excesses ... _ the very charge now leveled against
Israel by the present British government.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman said he did not expect the department
to comment because, ``That is history and it's for the historians to
decide.''
   One tactic was to force Arab cabdrivers to ride at the head of
British convoys in case the road was mined, the Independent said.
   A note from Sir John Shuckburgh, a senior government official at
the time, was quoted as likening conditions in Palestine to what the
British faced against Irish rebels 20 years earlier.
   ``We have to deal not with a chivalrous opponent playing the game
according to the rules, but with gangsters and murderers,''
Shuckburgh wrote.
   This followed the assassination of a British official in the town
of Jenin and the shooting death of the suspected assassin, allegedly
as he tried to escape after being arrested.
   A heavily armed convoy set out for Jenin, in what is now the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, carrying 9,300 pounds of the explosive
gelignite and orders that ``a large portion of the town should be
blown up,'' according to a commander's report dated Sept. 5, 1938.
   Demolishing homes is one of the penalties Israel has used during
the 13-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories.
It inherited this and other tactics from the British, who ruled
Palestine from 1917 until Israel won statehood in 1948.
   What particularly alarmed London, the Independent said, was
security forces' use of ``mine-sweeping taxis.''
   Known troublemakers owned the taxis, which were commandeered with
their drivers and put at the heads of convoys, the papers said.
   Lord Dufferin of Ava, parliamentary undersecretary at the
Colonial Office, wrote: ``Much as I dislike the implications of the
`mine-sweeping taxi,' I do not feel that we have the right to
interfere. British lives are being lost and I don't think we, from
the security of Whitehall, can protest squeamishly about measures
taken by the men in the front line.''
   Let's ``close our eyes,'' he recommended to the government in a
letter endorsed by other officials.
   A letter to the Colonial Office from the British High
Commissioner in Jerusalem, Sir Harold MacMichael, shared a concern
that the British were using ``Black and Tan tactics'' _ a reference
to atrocities committed by the Black and Tan units of British
military police in Ireland in 1920 and 1921.
   ``One recognizes that when men see their friends and comrades ...
blown into pieces by a land mine they are apt to `see red''' he
wrote. ``But there are limits which must not be passed.''
   The Independent said the papers contain ``no evidence of firm
government action to demand discipline and adherence to publicly
stated orders.''
   Many of the documents should have been made public in 1969 but
were withheld for an additional 20 years because of their
sensitivity, the Independent said.

   Two black policemen and a

   A third policeman suffered a bullet wound in the chest and was

   The civilian was described as a 45-year-old black man who
happened to be in the area at the time of the attack. None of the
victims' names was released.
   Police said the attackers used a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle. No
arrests were reported, and the police statement did not suggest a
possible motive for the attack.
   Black policemen have been frequent targets of attacks by
guerrillas and anti-apartheid militants who consider them
collaborators with the white-led government.

   George Bush begins his presidency awash in
political good will for the moment but strapped in the long run by
the legacy of debt from the Reagan administration. The trick is to
jump start his term without any money.
   Bush has been trying to dampen expectations of a dazzling new
start, perhaps hoping to insure that any early achievements seem
larger than life.
   Dismissing the notion of a dramatic first 100 days, Bush said in
an inauguration-eve interview, ``I'm not shooting for any 100 days.
And I think it's kind of a concept that doesn't really apply.''
   Bush is guaranteed of making a splash, though, just by comparison
with the way Ronald Reagan did things. There will be plenty of
differences to highlight _ many of them that will depict Bush as a
busy, hands-on manager in contrast to Reagan's laid-back style.
   A late sleeper, Reagan never got to work before 9 a.m. On his
first day, Bush was on the move at 8 a.m., leading a tour of the
White House for selected tourists. On regular work days, Bush is
expected to be in the Oval Office between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
   In public and private appearances, Reagan relied heavily on
prepared scripts and ``talking points'' written on file cards. Bush
is more comfortable speaking off the cuff, though he, too, depends
on speech writers to write formal remarks.
   Where Reagan's schedule was carefully choreographed, Bush is
spontaneous and often unpredictable. While Reagan consented to
always be accompanied by the press, Bush said he won't wait around
for reporters and will come and go as he pleases. ``You just don't
want to be totally isolated,'' he said.
   There will be a big emphasis on family and children in the Bush
White House. He has four grown sons and a daughter and 10
grandchildren who will be frequent visitors.
   In contrast, Reagan and his wife Nancy were often estranged from
their family.
   While Reagan was not fond of traveling overseas, Bush loves it,
making 40 separate foreign trips and visiting 74 nations since 1981.
He'll go to Tokyo for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito and
has not ruled out other stops on that trip. A NATO summit in
Brussels is likely in April, and an economic summit in Paris is set
for July.
   As Reagan flew into retirement on Friday, he acknowledged, ``I
think there are a lot of things yet to be done. ... Certainly a
change with regard to the abortion situation _ (I) couldn't get that
done yet.'' He also mentioned his futile efforts to get authority
for line-item vetoes on the budget and to win passage of a
constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.
   For Bush, the realities of the deficit loom over everything else
on the domestic agenda.
   On Monday, Bush will have his first Cabinet meeting and the
budget is sure to be Topic A. On Tuesday, he wants to meet at the
White House with the bipartisan leadership of Congress to open talks
on the $150 billion budget deficit bequeathed by Ronald Reagan. On
Feb. 9, he will address a joint session of Congress to announce his
budget priorities.
   For now, at least, congressional Democrats are treating Bush
warmly. ``Bush is extending the hand of friendship and we intend to
extend ours in return,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Former House Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill, who led the
Democrats' budget battles with Reagan, exulted, ``It's the dawn of a
new era. We're back to normalcy in the White House. How delighted I
am.''
   No one expects the honeymoon with a Democratic Congress to last
forever, and some think it will end sooner than later. ``The Hill is
stacked against them. It will give this administration little or no
slack,'' said Reagan's former political adviser, Mitchell Daniels.
``The Hill will treat this as an extension of the Reagan
administration.''
   Already the deficit has forced Bush to scale back on education
initiatives and other plans. ``Our funds are low,'' he said in his
inaugural address. ``We have a deficit to bring down. We have more
will than wallet; but will is what we need.''
   Bush, in an interview, said, ``We'll have to sort through and set
priorities. Some of what I want to do will have to wait on a
solution to the budget question.''
   While Bush and his lieutenants are hanging tough, polls show that
a majority of Americans doubt that the new president will be able to
live up to his promise not to raise taxes. He has to find billions
of dollars for the savings and loan industry crisis, the cleanup and
repair of the nation's nuclear weapon plants and other costly
problems.
   There also are vexing national security and foreign policy
problems. For the Pentagon, Bush has to decide on a scaled-down
budget and choose between two strategic weapon systems, the MX
missile or the Midgetman. He plans to order a major reassessment of
how to deal with the Soviet Union on arms control and other areas.
The Middle East and Central America also demand immediate attention.

<HEAD>Cleric Says Release of Britons `Imminent' But U.S. Must Make Concessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem cleric said in an
interview published Saturday there are signs British hostages in
Lebanon will be freed soon but that U.S. captives won't go free
until the United States makes concessions.
   President Bush said Saturday in Washington the United States
would make no concessions to free the hostages. ``We are not going
to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage,'' he said.
   The fundamentalist cleric, Sheik Sadek Mousawi, said the United
States should meet Iranian conditions for freeing the American
hostages, according to the interview published by the Beirut
magazine An-Nahar Arab and International.
   The magazine quoted Mousawi as saying, ``I would like to assert
that there are good indications of an imminent release of the
British hostages as a result of the Iranian-British rapprochement.''
   Britain and Iran agreed Dec. 9 to restore full diplomatic ties,
ending a 19-month break that followed the arrest of an Iranian
diplomat in England on shoplifting charges.
   Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. They
are Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, who disappeared Jan. 20,
1987; journalist John McCarthy, kidnapped April 17, 1986; and
educator Brian Keenan, a dual British-Irish national abducted April
11, 1986.
   Also missing is Alec Collett, a British journalist who was
working for the U.N. Relief and Works agency when he disappeared
March 25, 1985. An Islamic group claims to have killed him, but no
body was found.
   Mousawi heads a small group called The Islamic Movement, which
seeks to set up an Islamic republic in Lebanon patterned after the
Iranian regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Mousawi's group is allied with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, an umbrella organization for pro-Iranian factions
believed holding most of the hostages.
   The magazine quoted Mousawi as saying the United States would
have to make concessions to win freedom for the nine American
hostages.
   ``If America wants its hostages, then it has to respond to the
Iranian demands so that Iran would give the advice (to the hostage
holders) to free the American hostages,'' he said.
   Tehran has demanded release of $10 billion in Iranian assets
frozen in the United States as a precondition for its aid in
releasing the American hostages.
   The American captives include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who is the foreigner held
longest in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Mousawi said Iran could exert influence on the captors, even
though the kidnappings were ordered by ``Lebanese personalities''
and carried out by Lebanese without intervention from Iran.
   He added, ``But it is normal for any Moslem irrespective of how
far he is geographically from Iran to be influenced by the advice of
the officials in Iran.''

   President Bush, looking ahead Saturday to his
first days in office, said he will quickly answer a peace missive
from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and seek an early bipartisan
foreign policy relationship with Congress.
   A letter Bush received from Gorbachev through emissaries during
his inauguration ceremonies Friday congratulated him and offered
hopes for ``stable and diverse development of relations between our
countries, so important for peace throughout the world.''
   Bush told reporters that he would respond to the letter, which he
characterized as ``generous ... pledging world peace.'' He said he
had received other ``heartwarming'' expressions of good will from
leaders around the world and will respond to them as well.
   Taking questions from reporters as he sat at his Oval Office desk
during his first day on the job, Bush also said the United States
will not make concessions in an effort to free the U.S. hostages
held in Lebanon. He said he hopes his inaugural plea for help from
other countries on the hostage matter will be heard worldwide.
   ``I want to make clear to them that good will begets good will,''
he said.
   Bush indicated he has several things on his mind as he prepares
to begin his presidency, and said he couldn't wait to get started.
   A first formal meeting of his cabinet is set for Monday. On
Tuesday he will meet with a bipartisan group of congressional
leaders on the budget deficit and on foreign affairs, according to
chief of staff John Sununu.
   Bush aides have indicated there will be an ethics-in-government
package and he is expected to name an advisory commission on ethics,
with that coming within a matter of days, according to Sununu.
   Sununu said he expected Bush to make a statement to coincide with
Monday's anti-abortion demonstration in Washington to mark the
anniversary of the Roe V. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.
   Bush has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or a threat to the life of the mother, although in earlier years he
espoused a more flexible view.
   The president sent a letter Saturday to congressional leaders
formally asking to address a joint session of Congress on Feb. 9.
   Forseeing battles over his vow not to raise taxes, Bush
acknowledged many on Capitol Hill ``won't accept some of the
fundamental premises on which I was elected.''
   ``I'm not expecting miracles, but I want them to know we are
going to try,'' he said in remarks to a group of Republican
financial backers Saturday afternoon.
   Earlier Bush told reporters that despite his overtures to
Congress, he also has concerns ``about the erosion of presidential
power'' in which the House and Senate often are able to thwart
presidential initiatives.
   He said he wants to discuss that with members of Congress how
``to reestablish in the presidency the firm hand that I think the
Constitution gave the president.''
   Regarding the hostages, he said, ``We keep hearing rumors that
countries want to have improved relations with the United States.
But you can't finger any one country for holding hostages against
their will.''
   ``We are not going to escalate the currency of holding Americans
hostage. We are not going to have people feel that we are going to
make concessions in order to free those precious lives,'' Bush said.
   Bush displayed an upbeat and eager demeanor Saturday, the day
after he was sworn in as the 41st president.
   ``I can't wait to get to work. I mean, serious work,'' he told
reporters in the Oval Office. ``I couldn't wait to come over here
this morning.''
   Bush began his day Saturday by leading an open house for members
of the public to tour the White House, personally taking a group of
about two dozen of the first arrivals through the mansion's public
rooms.
   He also spent time with Chief of Staff John Sununu and met with
CIA Director William Webster and National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft, and took a moment to stroll on the White House grounds
and tennis court with his children and grandchildren.

   President Bush admitted Saturday with a
sheepish grin that he got lost wandering around on his first night
in the White House but vowed to ``get to work ... serious work'' on
his first day in the Oval Office.
   ``I couldn't wait to get in here ... It's wonderful,'' said Bush,
seated before a crackling fire with his mother, Dorothy Prescott
Bush, by his side.
   ``Oh, I think it's the most exciting day of my life _ so far!''
said Mrs. Bush, who was seated in the traditional chair reserved for
visiting heads of state and dignitaries when they visit the
president.
   From around 8 a.m. when Bush popped his head out of a
second-floor window to wave to tourists, the new president started a
first day that had its hectic moments. Several dozen inaugural week
visitors toured the mansion's ceremonial rooms and caused more
commotion than the White House has seen in years.
   Bush _ clad in a suit and sweater against the January chill _ led
several dozen members of his family on an impromptu tour of the
South Lawn and tennis court, capping the stroll by tossing a
footfall with his sons.
   Then the new president joined about 240 of his family members for
lunch in the East Room.
   Shortly before 9 a.m., Bush strolled across the colonnade and
entered the Oval Office, stealing a few private moments with the
matriarch of his family.
   Even at that hour, he already had put his stamp on the office _
several pens were neatly arranged on a gilt plate on his desk,
accompanied by a letter holder and a trio of books. Pictures of Bush
family members in plastic frames crowded the table behind his ornate
wooden desk.
   As he chatted amiably with reporters, the president sipped coffee
from a green and gold cup emblazoned with the eagle of the
presidential seal.
   A somber portrait of George Washington in full dress uniform
looked down upon the nation's 41st president. A dark bronze bust of
Teddy Roosevelt played sentry by a side door.
   Asked how he felt on his first visit to the office, Bush said,
``It feels just fine,'' noting that his large family was ``settling
in ... after the glamor and excitement of the inauguration.''
   ``I can't wait to get to work ... serious work. And we're going
to do some here today,'' Bush said. He said he has ``a good full
schedule'' for next week.
   ``I got lost in the White House yesterday evening when we came
in, trying to find a couple of kids rooms,'' Bush admitted when
asked about his first night in the mansion.
   As his mother beamed, Bush reached over and patted her on the
knee. ``This is the one who told me not to brag about myself and to
bend my knees when I volleyed,'' Bush cracked.
   The president said he began his day around 6 a.m., caring for a
sick grandchild, Nancy Ellis LeBlond, and that the recovery was
rapid _ ``Pumped a half a Tylenol into her and she's looking good.
Ate two pancakes.''
   Asked about the note President Reagan left for him on Friday
before leaving the office, Bush told an aide to pull it from the
desk drawer.
   Holding high a notepad with the inscription, ``Don't let the
turkeys get you down,'' Bush showed reporters how Reagan had written
his successor he'd ``have moments when you'll want to use this
particular stationary. Well, go to it.''
   ``You'll be in my prayers. God bless you and Barbara. I'll miss
our Thursday lunches,'' Bush quoted Reagan as saying in the note.
   Bush also touched on matters of policy ranging from U.S.-Soviet
relations to relations with Congress.
   He told reporters that ``the United States will stay strong'' and
that occasionally presidents are called upon to use force. ``This
president will be no different,'' he vowed.
   He went on to muse about the limits of presidential power and
said he intended to work with Congress ``not only to avoid the
erosion of power but to re-establish ... the firm hand that I think
the Constitution gave the president.''
   Bush, who has vowed not to answer questions in the so-called
``photo opportunities'' set up by the White House, insisted that his
17-minute session with reporters and photographers ``is not a phot
op.''
   ``I love it when it's tranquil and peaceful like this,'' Bush
told the assembled reporters and photographers as the cameras
clicked and the reporters asked questions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush opened the White House doors
Saturday to a band of shivering pilgrims _ some in tuxedos and
others wrapped in quilts _ who had waited outside all night for a
chance to greet him in his new home.
   ``I've been here 11 hours and 30 minutes. It's cold,'' said Kyle
Shadix of Atlanta when the White House east gate was finally
unlocked shortly after 7 a.m.
   Cheers and occasional shouts of ``Where's George?'' came from the
long line of bundled-up people clutching sleeping bags, quilts and
blankets as they streamed into a security area to walk through metal
detectors.
   ``One of the highlights of the tour is heat,'' Secret Service
Agent William Ludtke joked as the crowd moved out of the 24-degree
chill and into the historic house.
   The White House American Welcome, billed as Bush's first official
act as president and as the first White House open house in 80
years, prompted dozens of people to sleep out overnight to make sure
they were admitted.
   More than 4,000 visitors took the free tours as part of the
three-hour open house. What made the event different from the
regular Saturday tours was that Bush and his wife were on hand to
greet many of the visitors.
   Inauguration officials said a new president had not made such a
planned, formal gesture since 1909.
   The earliest arrivals showed up at 8:30 p.m. Friday, and the long
vigil paid off for 15 people chosen to tour the White House with
Bush and his wife Barbara.
   ``The president actually stood beside me and nudged me and said
`what do you think of this room?''' said Dick Nichols, 52, of
Baltimore.``I said, `It's beautiful.'''
   He paused and laughed incredulously. ``I never thought it would
happen. I never thought he'd even be there. It's something I'll
never forget. I will never be that close a president again.''
   It was barely light in the south courtyard of the White House
when the first visitors were allowed in, but the mood was festive.
The Truman Balcony was hung with red, white and blue bunting, and a
U.S. Marine Band pianist sent cocktail music wafting across the lawn.
   College students and senior citizens and parents lugging children
in snowsuits shouted ``We love you George'' as the first couple
strode out to make brief remarks. ``I know some of you have been up
all night long,'' Bush told about 1,500 patient fans. ``We just
wanted to wish you well and welcome you to the people's house.''
   Those on the personal tour were a mix of students, older people
and families, all among the first to arrive Friday night. Also
picked was a double amputee in a wheelchair. The Bushes, accompanied
by a curator, led the small group through several ceremonial rooms,
the same ones shown on normal White House tours.
   ``It was just great. He was the kindest man. I wasn't expecting
him to get up so early,'' said Adam Slater of Pittsburgh.
   Slater, Steven Resnick and Saul Kellner, three George Washington
University students, earned their presidential tour by being the
very first in line. The president, they said, was as nice as they
had expected.
   ``He treated us like we were real people _ not like rabble,''
Resnick, of Scotch Plains, N.J., said in amazement. What next? ``I'm
going to call my parents,'' said Kellner, of Manalapan, N.J.
   The decorous tour was a far cry from Andrew Jackson's inaugural
open house in 1829. Muddy-booted men stepped on chairs and knocked
over furniture and glassware to get at the refreshments, which were
later moved onto the lawn in hopes the unruly crowd would follow.
Jackson ended up cornered by the mob and had to be spirited out the
back door.
   William Howard Taft held the most recent open house, shaking
visitors' hands for hours the day after his inauguration in 1909.
Bush and his wife continued that tradition Saturday after their
stint as escorts, greeting hundreds more people with handshakes and
chitchat before leaving for other engagements.
   ``It was well worth not sleeping,'' said Claudine Fortunato of
Westchester, N.Y. ``He's got a nice firm handshake, he really
does,'' said Tom St. George of Springfield, Va. ``It wasn't an
assembly line. He looked me in the eye and said thanks for coming
by. It was completely worth waiting for,'' said John Donnelly of
Philadelphia.
   Donnelly was among several men attired in tuxedos, telltale
evidence that they had come straight from Friday night inaugural
balls to camp outside the White House. Commenting on the phenomenon
later, Bush said he had shaken hands with people who ``had been to
one of these balls and ... slept out there.''
   ``Now what does it take for somebody to stay awake all night to
come into the White House?'' Bush mused. ``What kind of people were
they? They were all different kinds of people... The common thread
was that they felt they were lucky to be there, which amazed me in a
sense because I felt we were so lucky to have people that would care
that much.''

   Grand Ole Opry performer Johnny Russell
was home Saturday after being released from the hospital where he
underwent triple bypass heart surgery, his agent said.
   ``He's doing great,'' publicist Steve Campbell said. ``He is home
right now and doing real well.''
   Russell, who had a hit with ``Act Naturally,'' underwent surgery
Jan. 10. Fellow country stars Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings also
had heart surgery within days of Russell's operation.
   While he was hospitalized, Russell was deluged with get well
wishes, Campbell said.
   ``They counted a little over 5,000 pieces of mail during the 10
days he was in. For several days, half the mail the hospital got was

   The singer isn't expected to return to the stage until around
April 1, Campbell said.

<HEAD>Homemakers Say They'll Protest Scarcity of Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of homemakers said Saturday
they will protest at government offices because of a shortage of
goods that has created a wave of panic buying and put the government
at odds with manufacturers.
   ``There's no coffee, toilet paper or detergent. There hasn't been
all week. It's been crazy,'' said Cesar Rumbos, a supermarket clerk
in Caracas.
   He was describing a wave of panic shopping after a group of
companies announced they would no longer be able to supply the
market with goods. Many stores simply closed their doors by week's
end, unable to stock shelves with items ranging from toothpaste to
milk.
   The government says manufacturers are storing away goods to
pressure it into increasing import subsidies, which have been
curtailed.
   ``In Venezuela, the scarcity is false and distorted,'' said
President Jaime Lusinchi late Friday. He blamed manufacturers for
hoarding and smugglers for taking goods out of the country,
especially to neighboring Colombia and the Caribbean. Venezuelan
products often fetch higher prices there.
   The homemakers said they were fed up with both the government and
manufacturers. They announced they would protest this week in front
of the government's Superintendency for Consumer Protection to
highlight the scarcity.
   ``The government says there's no problems because they assigned
the dollars (for import subsidies). The industrialists say they
haven't gotten them. The truth is consumers have lost faith in both
the government and the industrialists,'' said Diana Vegas, head of a
neighborhood group.
   Advertisements placed in local newspapers by a soap maker and a
paper manufacturer blamed the government for cutting back on the
subsidies granted to Venezuelan companies to import goods.
   President-elect Carlos Andres Perez has warned the program must
be eliminated in an effort to bolster U.S. dollar reserves, which
are used in the program. A slump in prices for oil, a major national
export, has contributed to the reserve crisis.
   Manufacturers and the business community generally welcome the
reform in the long run. However, they blame the Lusinchi
administration for the shortfall in reserves that led to the cutback
in dollars for imports.
   ``There's one reason for the scarcity. The government has no
money to assign us,'' said Habib Levi, a diaper manufacturer. He
said his company, Panales Mammi, has cut production in half and
denied it was hoarding.

<HEAD>One Thing Was for Sure: Ronald Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 11th graf bgng ``Reagan campaigned ... '' to CORRECT that
federal debt has reached $2.6 trillion, sted billion.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In an uncertain world, Ronald Reagan stood for
certainty. He was unwavering, absolute in his convictions _
especially when changing.
   Consistency was not a hobgoblin of the Reagan White House.
   That style not only worked, it triumphed. The 40th president left
office on Friday with the highest public approval ratings since the
pollsters started keeping score.
   A New York Times-CBS News poll conducted Jan. 12 to 15 showed
that 68 percent approval of Reagan's job performance. That's 9
points higher than the farewell approval rating of Dwight D.
Eisenhower. And Reagan made those numbers count politically. He was
the first president in 60 years to leave office at the inauguration
of an elected successor of his own party.
   For Reagan, the genius was not in the details but, more often, in
avoiding them. He made U turns without a signal, and usually without
a problem. He campaigned against deficits and tripled them. He won
the biggest tax cut in U.S. history and later quietly signed the
biggest increase. He denounced Moscow's ``evil empire,'' then
fashioned a ``new closeness'' with the Soviet Union under new
leadership.
   A prime exhibit: the swollen federal budget deficit.
   ``Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal
domestic program spending,'' Reagan said in the budget he bequeathed
to President Bush. ``Time and again these proposals have been
rejected by Congress.''
   He said the deficit problem began with the recession that hit
early in his first term, and worsened because he couldn't get half
the spending curbs he sought. By Reagan's reckoning, he hadn't
changed, conditions had. So he kept making the deficit speech while
the deficit soared on his watch.
   But in six of the eight Reagan budget years, the budget passed by
Congress actually was lower than that proposed by the administration.
   Supplemental appropriations, approved after the budget resolution
was adopted, pushed actual spending higher than the Reagan budget in
all but two of those years. Those additions were the handiwork of
both Congress and the administration.
   Reagan campaigned in 1980 with a promise to balance the budget
within a four-year term. The federal debt has nearly tripled, to
$2.6 trillion, during his two terms. The average deficit was $180
billion.
   With deficits worsening, Reagan insisted that a balanced budget
had not been a campaign commitment _ ``I've never said anything but
that it was a goal.''
   He promised a military buildup and he delivered, a $2.4 trillion
expansion during his eight years. That fed the deficit and the
struggle over priorities that raged through both his terms.
   Reagan political challenges stayed the hands of two presidents,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, in arms control dealings with Moscow.
Ford dropped the word ``detente'' from his vocabulary while fending
off Reagan in 1976. Compared with the Reagan-era thaw, Ford's
detente was a chill.
   Reagan's farewell address described ``a satisfying new closeness
with the Soviet Union.'' He and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
signed the treaty to scrap intermediate range nuclear missiles, met
at the summit five times in three years and fashioned a dramatically
different relationship between Washington and Moscow.
   Reagan said that was possible because ``this time, so far, it's
different,'' the Soviet Union has changed.
   Reagan changed, too, but he wasn't given to mentioning it.
   When the Iran arms sales of 1985 and 1986 were disclosed, Reagan
insisted he had not tried to trade arms for hostages.
   The record showed otherwise. When his own investigating
commission said so, the president acknowledged that what he called
an attempted opening to Iran had deteriorated into arms for hostages.
   Even then, he said ``my heart and my best intentions still tell
me'' it wasn't a trade despite ``the facts and the evidence.'' Soon
afterward he reverted to the no-trade position and stuck with it to
the end of his term.
   For all that, Reagan's years were years of evolution. ``They call
it the Reagan Revolution and I'll accept that,'' he said, ``but for
me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery: a rediscovery
of our values and our common sense.''
   Rediscovery or revolution, it rewrote the agenda, ending an era
in which government programs multiplied to address each emerging
problem. Reagan always said that government was the problem, not the
solution.
   He argued that the government shouldn't have more revenue because
it would only spend the money. His parting budget advice was to curb
deficits ``by continuing to limit the appetite of government.''
   A troubling legacy to President Bush, the deficits Reagan rued
may yet serve the purposes of the Reagan revolution. Limits on
government are more easily enforced when borrowing is the only way
to pay the bills.

   America's new first family and second family _
the Bushes and the Quayles _ spent their first night in office
partyhopping around the capital.
   All told, there were nine official balls and two youth balls on
Friday night. President Bush called himself a ``lousy dancer'' but
the ball crowds thought he was wonderful nonetheless.
   Here are on-the-ballroom-floor reports from some AP reporters are
a few of the balls:

   ``You're going to see a lousy dancer trying to dance the first
dance with the first lady,'' President Bush told the crowd Friday
night as he took his wife Barbara's hand and moved about the
platform to the tune of ``I Could Have Danced All Night.''
   The dance was brief, but the appearance by the president and
first lady was enough for the 5,000 that jammed the newly-restored
train station's Main Hall.
   They cheered as the first couple walked the deck atop the center
kiosk and waved. Above them, red, white and blue bursts of sparkles,
gold bunting and light blue streamers were hanging from every
corner. Outside, guests purchased T-shirts, sweatshirts and other
souvenirs at a stand equipped with a credit card machine.
   Among those jostled in the crowd were actor George Hamilton,
singers Wayne Newton and Jimmy Dean, and artist Peter Max.
   David Treen, governor of Louisiana for four years and a U.S.
congressman for seven years, said it was the last inaugural ball he
planned to attend.
   ``I can't believe this is anyone's idea of fun,'' he said of the
cash-bar event that included seating only for guests who paid extra.

   The inaugural ball at the Omni Shoreham had special significance
for 7-year-old Jessica Cartonia, this year's ``Little Miss Buffalo.''
   ``She was conceived in the Shoreham eight years ago,'' said
Jessica's mother, Sharon.
   As little Jessica, decked out in a long white gown listened, Mrs.
Cartonia recalled how she and her husband attended Ronald Reagan's
inaugural in 1981.
   The Cartonias, both long-time workers at the Erie County Board of
Elections, had given up on having children when they came to the
nation's capital for her first inaugural.
   Surprise! In February 1981, Mrs. Cartonia learned she was
pregnant with Jessica.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Look-alike Delights Pension Building Crowd</HEAD>

   At the elegant Civil War Pension Building, the luminaries
included CIA Director William Webster, Senators Alan K. Simpson of
Wyoming and Bob Dole of Kansas, and Dole's wife Elizabeth, Bush's
designate for secretary of labor.
   But perhaps the most photographed person at the ball was Ronald
V. Knapp.
   A Gorbachev look-alike complete with an artificial birthmark, he
spent the night laughing and being photographed alongside other
partygoers. ``I'll probably end up in more scrapbooks than anybody
in Washington,'' he said.
   Maybe he looked too much like the Soviet leader. Webster arrived
with two bodyguards, despite the already tight security.
   Simpson danced in an impromptu conga line joined by hundreds of
other celebrants dressed in anything from black tie to Scottish
tartan kilts, at a party including states and territories ranging
from Simpson's Wyoming to Guam and the Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>At Air And Space Museum, Bushes Dance Beneath Planes</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President and Mrs. Bush waltzed beneath the X-15 experimental
aircraft and the plane that the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk
at the ball for the Texas and South Carolina contingents at the Air
and Space Museum.
   Bush apologized for what he called ``the shortest dance
demonstration you will ever have to put up with'' as he and wife
Barbara danced to the strains of ``I Could Have Danced All Night,''
from the musical, ``My Fair Lady.''
   ``Oh, she looks great,'' gushed Joanne Lawson, a member of the
ball host committee, commenting on Mrs. Bush dancing in her gown
with a midnight blue velvet bodice and taffeta skirt with pearl and
diamond earrings and a double-stranded pearl necklace.
   One Texan whose credentials were never questioned was Arnie the
Armadillo, who in the absence of Bush drew heavy attention from the
media.
   ``He's too famous to race,'' said Jim Schmidt, keeper of Arnie
and spokesman for the Texas Armadillo Association, headquartered in
New Braunfels.

<HEAD>Twin Inaugural Balls At Convention Center A Lesson In Contrasts</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The ``Stars'' party at the Washington Convention Center was a
free-flowing, lighthearted affair but things got testy at the
``Stripes'' bash in the other hall.
   Long-time bush friend Lionel Hampton entertained the ``Stars''
crowd, and the first family was represented by presidential son
Marvin Bush and his wife Margaret.
   ``I paid a lot for this dress and I wanted you to see it,'' said
Marvin of his wife's navy blue velvet dress as he introduced her to
the crowd.
   Washington's local office holders _ mostly Democrats _ wondered
aloud why they had been invited but they were obviously pleased.
   ``It was significantly symbolic that the city was represented by
its chief of police in the inaugural parade,'' said city council
member Charlene Drew Jarvis. Washington has been plagued by a murder
wave, with more slayings per capita than any other U.S. city.
   On the other side of the convention center, Virginia Sen. John
Warner and former Republican senate candidate Linda Chavez of
Maryland were on hand when tempers got a little testy at the
overcrowded ``Stripes'' ball.
   Even entertainer Lee Greenwood, leading the party-goers in
singing his favorite, ``I'm Proud To Be An American,'' couldn't keep
nerves calm.
   One man reportedly punched a news photographer who aimed his
camera in the participant's direction while taking random shots of
the crowd.

<HEAD>At the Kennedy Center: No Room Even to Faint</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Several people fainted during the sardine-can simulation at the
Kennedy Center, where 5,000 people in a place that maybe could
accommodate 1,500. The crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted
was kept from falling to the floor: no floor space was available.
   One woman complained that she had spent ``all this money'' on her
new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies
room.
   No one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 p.m. in
the Grand Foyer that parallels the Potomac River and connects the
Kennedy Center's three auditoriums, until after George and Barbara
Bush's five-minute visit at 11:25 p.m.
   During the three-hour wait for the Bushes' visit, the
shoulder-to-bosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their
neighbors. The resulting din was such that:
   Even conversation was difficult and the most effective
communications award should go to the two women sign-language users
who had been stationed on either side of the make-shift stage so
they could translate Bush's comments to the hard-of-hearing. During
the long-wait for the presidential party, the two signers chatted
back and forth across the 50-foot stage. It was the only way to
communicate.

<HEAD>Young Republicans Chant ``USA, USA'' For Their New Idols</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Several thousand young Republicans danced shoulder to shoulder to
the throbbing beat of rock bands and music videos and roared their
approval for President Bush and Vice President Quayle.
   ``To be included in this is incredible,'' said Kerry Trost, 16,
of Fairfax, Va., who got her $30 ticket from a friend.
   The crowd of about 3,000 at the Young Americans Ball _ one of two
for the under-30 set _ really came alive after Bush and Quayle made
their appearances.
   They chanted ``USA, USA, USA'' as Quayle stood on the stage
thanking the young Republicans for their support and promising a
bright future. Bush received an even louder welcome.
   ``This is one of the most exciting things. I've never seen a
president or vice president before,'' Ruben Rodriguez, a
hearing-impaired student at Galludet University in Washington, D.C.,
signed through an interpreter.
   The crowd, most of whom were in their 20s, was largely white.
Although Elizabeth Smith, a Washington, D.C., clerk had not expected
to be in the majority, she had not expected to be one of a handful
of blacks at the party.
   ``I saw very few blacks and the ones I saw were working,'' she
said.
   As many men arrived at the Marriott in coat and tie as in
tuxedos, but most of the women wore formal dresses and gowns, and _
as Susie Ostrander of Newport Beach, Calif., and Stacey Schlosser of
Washington, D.C., discovered during a break in the women's room _
sometimes the same one.
   ``We're good friends now,'' Schlosser said, after the two posed
for a picture in their distinctive full-length gowns of black velvet
with a layered white taffeta skirt and large white bow on the back.

<HEAD>At Armory, Young Americans Toast A ``Get-Down President''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dress and decorum were relaxed at the Young Americans Ball for
the under-30 crowd at the D.C. Armory, where ballroom dancing was
replaced with hard rock, wall-sized video screens and even a
bunny-hop line or two.
   Organizers had tried to soften the cavernous setting with red,
white and blue drapes, fringed metallic streamers and flowers, but
it still had a look akin to a high school gymnasium dressed up for
the prom.
   Long gowns mixed with short skirts; tuxedos alternated with suits.
   Before the fete had ended, the floor was littered with
stadium-size Budweiser cups, beer cans and empty champagne bottles.
Young women _ and occassionally their dates _ were seen slipping off
their too-tight shoes.
   Between the appearances of Bush and Quayle, the latter of whom
looked like he would have fit right in, the biggest hit of the night
was actor Ricky Schroeder. A bevy of squealing girls and clicking
cameras tracked him around the room.
   When the crowd's energy started to flag at one point, the Bus
Boys' bass player reminded them they were celebrating ``the
inaugural day for a brand new get-down president.''

<HEAD>Bush Likes New Home; Quayle Likes ``Say Hey'' Crowd</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It was nearly midnight when Bush greeted those gathered at the
Sheraton. He and Barbara had stopped at their new home to refresh
themselves for the marathon evening, he said.
   ``Don't worry about our housing. We were at the White House for
two hours and, boy, is it something special ... unbelievable,'' Bush
declared.
   Eariler, Quayle and Marilyn made the Sheraton their first stop of
the evening.
   ``Hey,'' Quayle shouted as he took the stage. ``Hey,'' the crowd
intoned back.
   ``This sounds like a good group. We might just stick around for
awhile,'' Quayle said to applause.
   Then, a reluctant Quayle gave in to an inaugural tradition. ``I
guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance,'' the
vice president, as began a stiff, slow spin around the stage.

   Some waited more than five hours for their chance to applaud the
new president at the Washington Hilton, where Bush arrived after his
appearances at the other 10 official ball sites.
   ``When's he getting here?'' ``Are we really last?'' ``What time
did you hear he was coming?''
   The main ballroom was so jammed that for more than an hour the
local fire marshals, aided at first by Boy Scouts and later by
police, barred the doors.
   ``You should have heard them. They were banging on the doors.
They were shouting. They paid all that money for tickets and they
wanted in,'' said a fire inspector.
   It was next to impossible to dance in the human gridlock, and
very difficult to get drinks, so many simply marked time with
politicking and people-watching.
   A young woman who described herself only as a ``debutante from
Pittsburgh and Washington'' wore a zebra-print mini-dress with a
white ruffled train and was inundated by strangers wanting to take
her picture.
   Martha Poli of Derry, Pa. did her people-watching from a carpeted
corridor, where she and two companions cornered a section of the
floor.
   ``It's just too crowded,'' she said. ``We're not having fun.''

<HEAD>Bush: No Concessions, But `Won't Forget' Any Help For Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said on his first day in the
Oval Office Saturday he is prepared to respond in kind to any acts
of good will by those holding Americans hostage, but will make no
concessions ``to free those precious lives.''
   ``People in the past facilitated the release of our citizens, and
I'd love to see that happen again, and I won't _ and I won't forget
it,'' if it does, Bush declared.
   In a freewheeling exchange with reporters, the new president also
said he intends to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday to
discuss the government's spending deficit, and has asked to address
a joint session of Congress Feb. 9. Bush hinted that would be a more
specific call to action than what he termed a ``thematic'' inaugural
address on Friday.
   ``Stay tuned. Feb. 9th, we'll have something a little different,
if that's the date that's settled on,'' he said.
   After a night of celebration at 11 inaugural balls, Bush and his
wife Barbara were up early to open the doors of the White House to
4,500 ordinary Americans, many of whom had stood in line for hours
in bitter cold for a special tour and a chance to stroll the South
Lawn.
   It was the first ``open house'' at the executive mansion since
William Howard Taft held a public reception 80 years ago. But it was
hardly reminiscent of the most famous such occurrence, when
thousands of Tennessee frontiersmen in muddy boots followed Andrew
Jackson through the doors in 1829 and virtually trashed the place.
   After personally escorting 15 tourists, picked at random, through
his new home, Bush took his place at the Oval Office desk occupied
by Ronald Reagan for the last eight years. There, he found a
personal note left behind by his mentor, inscribed on joke-shop
stationery which bore the printed heading: ``Don't Let the Turkeys
Get You Down.''
   Beneath it was Reagan's handwriting: ``Dear George. You'll have
moments when you want to use this particular stationery. Well, go to
it. George, I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the
very best. You'll be in my prayers. God Bless you and Barbara. I'll
miss our Thursday lunches. Ron.''
   Showing the note to reporters, Bush said none of those assembled
should take the ``turkey'' reference personally. ``It is a broad,
ecumenical statement,'' he grinned.
   With his aging mother, Dorothy Prescott Bush, seated at his side,
Bush took his first presidential news conference question:
   Q: How does it feel to be president?
   A: It feels just fine. It's setting in now after the glamour and
excitement of the inauguration. It's a great joy to have my mother
here, the leader of our family.
   Later, he declared ``It's the most exciting day of my life so
far. It just is wonderful. Everything's been perfect. Everything's
so beautiful.''
   Bush said, too, he would soon respond to a ``generous letter''
from Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev. In the letter, Gorbachev told
Bush he hoped his term would bring ``stable and diverse development
of relations between our countries,'' and that they could work
together ``to eliminate the threat of war.''
   Bush's schedule included an intelligence briefing from National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Chief of Staff John Sununu, an
appearance at a luncheon for the financial organizers of his $25
million inaugural, and a second night of formal revelry, including a
``Black Tie 'n' Boots'' ball for his fellow Texans. His official
inaugural calendar ends Sunday with a national prayer service at the
Washington Cathedral.
   Bush acknowledged he couldn't find his way around the White House
his first night, after he and the first lady returned from the long
round of balls. ``I got lost trying to find a couple of kids' rooms,
yeah,'' he chuckled.
   Along with his mother, five of Bush's children, their spouses and
10 grandchildren shared the first night in the mansion. After a
luncheon for the entire Bush clan in town _ 240 relatives in all _
the kin scattered.
   ``It's a great joy to have our kids over there (in the living
quarters) last night,'' said Bush. ``One got sick, so I had the duty
at about 6 o'clock this morning _ Ellie LeBlond. I pumped half a
Tylenol into her and she's looking good. Ate two pancakes. What
you'd call a rapid recovery.''
   Bush expressed special feeling, too, for the thousands who stood
outside the White House, in subfreezing temperatures, for a chance
to tour it at the new president's invitation. The White House is
routinely opened for limited tours by the public, but this was
different.
   ``I must say that was kind of interesting,'' said Bush. ``I was
saying to myself, `Now what does it take for somebody to stay awake
all night to come into the White House? What kind of people are
they? Well, they were all different kinds of people. A lot of kids.
A lot of young people. Some older.
   ``The common thread was that they felt they were lucky to be
there, which amazed me in a sense because I thought we were so lucky
to have people that would care that much.''
   On the hostage issue, Bush was asked if his inaugural address
reflected any movement or change of policy regarding the
imprisonment of AP Correspondent Terry Anderson and eight other
Americans believed held in Lebanon by Shiite Moslems. Bush had said
in the speech that ``assistance can be shown here, and will be long
remembered. Good will begets good will.''
   Bush told reporters ``I don't think it's a change of policy. But
I wanted to be sure I mentioned in that speech my absolute
determination not to forget either ... the POW-MIAs or these
hostages. And I wanted that right in there. It was one the few
specific points in an otherwise thematic speech. And in terms of
your question, I hope it was heard around the world.
   ``You know,'' Bush added, ``we keep hearing rumors that countries
want to have improved relations with the United States. I wanted to
make clear to them that good will begets good will. I also know
enough about the situation to think, in fairness, that because of
the nature of the hostage-holders you can can't finger any one
country for holding Americans hostage against their will.
   ``But people have in the past facilitated the release of our
citizens, and I'd love to see that happen again, and I won't _ and I
won't forget it.
   ``But having said that,'' Bush concluded, ``we're not going to
escalate the currency of holding Americans hostage. We're not going
to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order
to free those precious lives.''

   America's new first family and second family _
the Bushes and the Quayles _ spent their first night in office
partyhopping around the capital.
   All told, there were nine official balls and two youth balls on
Friday night. President Bush called himself a ``lousy dancer'' but
the ball crowds thought he was wonderful nonetheless.
   Here are on-the-ballroom-floor reports from some AP reporters are
a few of the balls:

   ``You're going to see a lousy dancer trying to dance the first
dance with the first lady,'' President Bush told the crowd Friday
night as he took his wife Barbara's hand and moved about the
platform to the tune of ``I Could Have Danced All Night.''
   The dance was brief, but the appearance by the president and
first lady was enough for the 5,000 that jammed the newly-restored
train station's Main Hall.
   They cheered as the first couple walked the deck atop the center
kiosk and waved. Above them, red, white and blue bursts of sparkles,
gold bunting and light blue streamers were hanging from every
corner. Outside, guests purchased T-shirts, sweatshirts and other
souvenirs at a stand equipped with a credit card machine.
   Among those jostled in the crowd were actor George Hamilton,
singers Wayne Newton and Jimmy Dean, and artist Peter Max.
   David Treen, governor of Louisiana for four years and a U.S.
congressman for seven years, said it was the last inaugural ball he
planned to attend.
   ``I can't believe this is anyone's idea of fun,'' he said of the
cash-bar event that included seating only for guests who paid extra.

<HEAD>GOP Inaugurals Hold Special Meaning For Buffalo Family</HEAD>

   The inaugural ball at the Omni Shoreham had special significance
for 7-year-old Jessica Cartonia, this year's ``Little Miss Buffalo.''
   ``She was conceived in the Shoreham eight years ago,'' said
Jessica's mother, Sharon.
   As little Jessica, decked out in a long white gown listened, Mrs.
Cartonia recalled how she and her husband attended Ronald Reagan's
inaugural in 1981.
   The Cartonias, both long-time workers at the Erie County Board of
Elections, had given up on having children when they came to the
nation's capital for her first inaugural.
   Surprise! In February 1981, Mrs. Cartonia learned she was
pregnant with Jessica.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Look-alike Delights Pension Building Crowd</HEAD>

   At the elegant Civil War Pension Building, the luminaries
included CIA Director William Webster, Senators Alan K. Simpson of
Wyoming and Bob Dole of Kansas, and Dole's wife Elizabeth, Bush's
designate for secretary of labor.
   But perhaps the most photographed person at the ball was Ronald
V. Knapp.
   A Gorbachev look-alike complete with an artificial birthmark, he
spent the night laughing and being photographed alongside other
partygoers. ``I'll probably end up in more scrapbooks than anybody
in Washington,'' he said.
   Maybe he looked too much like the Soviet leader. Webster arrived
with two bodyguards, despite the already tight security.
   Simpson danced in an impromptu conga line joined by hundreds of
other celebrants dressed in anything from black tie to Scottish
tartan kilts, at a party including states and territories ranging
from Simpson's Wyoming to Guam and the Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>At Air And Space Museum, Bushes Dance Beneath Planes</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President and Mrs. Bush waltzed beneath the X-15 experimental
aircraft and the plane that the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk
at the ball for the Texas and South Carolina contingents at the Air
and Space Museum.
   Bush apologized for what he called ``the shortest dance
demonstration you will ever have to put up with'' as he and wife
Barbara danced to the strains of ``I Could Have Danced All Night,''
from the musical, ``My Fair Lady.''
   ``Oh, she looks great,'' gushed Joanne Lawson, a member of the
ball host committee, commenting on Mrs. Bush dancing in her gown
with a midnight blue velvet bodice and taffeta skirt with pearl and
diamond earrings and a double-stranded pearl necklace.
   One Texan whose credentials were never questioned was Arnie the
Armadillo, who in the absence of Bush drew heavy attention from the
media.
   ``He's too famous to race,'' said Jim Schmidt, keeper of Arnie
and spokesman for the Texas Armadillo Association, headquartered in
New Braunfels.

<HEAD>Twin Inaugural Balls At Convention Center A Lesson In Contrasts</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The ``Stars'' party at the Washington Convention Center was a
free-flowing, lighthearted affair but things got testy at the
``Stripes'' bash in the other hall.
   Long-time bush friend Lionel Hampton entertained the ``Stars''
crowd, and the first family was represented by presidential son
Marvin Bush and his wife Margaret.
   ``I paid a lot for this dress and I wanted you to see it,'' said
Marvin of his wife's navy blue velvet dress as he introduced her to
the crowd.
   Washington's local office holders _ mostly Democrats _ wondered
aloud why they had been invited but they were obviously pleased.
   ``It was significantly symbolic that the city was represented by
its chief of police in the inaugural parade,'' said city council
member Charlene Drew Jarvis. Washington has been plagued by a murder
wave, with more slayings per capita than any other U.S. city.
   On the other side of the convention center, Virginia Sen. John
Warner and former Republican senate candidate Linda Chavez of
Maryland were on hand when tempers got a little testy at the
overcrowded ``Stripes'' ball.
   Even entertainer Lee Greenwood, leading the party-goers in
singing his favorite, ``I'm Proud To Be An American,'' couldn't keep
nerves calm.
   One man reportedly punched a news photographer who aimed his
camera in the participant's direction while taking random shots of
the crowd.

<HEAD>At the Kennedy Center: No Room Even to Faint</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Several people fainted during the sardine-can simulation at the
Kennedy Center, where 5,000 people in a place that maybe could
accommodate 1,500. The crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted
was kept from falling to the floor: no floor space was available.
   One woman complained that she had spent ``all this money'' on her
new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies
room.
   No one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 p.m. in
the Grand Foyer that parallels the Potomac River and connects the
Kennedy Center's three auditoriums, until after George and Barbara
Bush's five-minute visit at 11:25 p.m.
   During the three-hour wait for the Bushes' visit, the
shoulder-to-bosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their
neighbors. The resulting din was such that:
   Even conversation was difficult and the most effective
communications award should go to the two women sign-language users
who had been stationed on either side of the make-shift stage so
they could translate Bush's comments to the hard-of-hearing. During
the long-wait for the presidential party, the two signers chatted
back and forth across the 50-foot stage. It was the only way to
communicate.

   A plane carrying 17 people crashed
outside a town in northern Sweden on Saturday, but everyone on board
escaped injury, officials said.
   The twin-engine Muk Air plane crashed shortly after leaving the
airport outside Ornskoldsvik, 880 miles north of Stockholm, airline
spokeswoman Knut Linda said. Linda said the 15 passengers and two
pilots were not injured.
   Earlier, police had said two people suffered slight injuries.
   The plane took off at 4:30 p.m. from the airport at Ornskoldsvik
heading for Copenhagen.
   Linda said the pilot registered a fall in oil pressure shortly
after takeoff. The pilot decided to stop the engine and return to
Ornskoldsvik but crashed about 30 yards from the runway.
   ``A guardian angel held its hand over the Danes when they tried
to emergency land,'' the national news agency TT quoted Erling
Sandstrom, chief of the Ornskoldsvik airport, as saying.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders on Saturday praised the
tone of conciliation sounded by President Bush in his inaugural
address but said the nation should expect some discord as the new
administration pursues an agenda.
   ``There's a good spirit now and I think that's useful,'' said
Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., the House Majority Leader. ``There
will be some difficulties and disagreements obviously but it's a
good mood in which to start any administration.''
   ``George Bush has done everything during the transition that he
could to offer an olive branch to the Congress,'' said Rep. Dick
Cheney, R-Wyo., the House Minority Whip.
   ``The reaction yesterday on both sides of the aisle was very
positive to the president's speech,'' he said. But he cautioned: ``I
think people shouldn't mistake this for meaning there won't be
disagreements. There will be. ... That's as it should be.''
   Foley and Cheney appeared on Cable News Network's ``Newsmaker
Saturday'' program.
   Bush, in his inaugural address on Friday asked for a new
cooperative spirit between the Republican White House and the
Democratic Congress. While he offered little detail of what specific
proposals he'll ask Congress to approve, Bush's speech was greeted
warmly by the opposition.
   On Saturday, Bush said he has suggested to congressional leaders
that he address a joint session of the House and Senate on Feb. 9 to
lay out his plans.
   ``It was a beautiful and warm speech, less ideological (than
former President Reagan) and I feel much better,'' Rep. Anthony
Beilenson, D-Calif., said of Bush's inaugural address.
   But Beilenson, a member of the House Rules Committee, said Bush
still was not dealing realistically with the deficit and the need
for raising taxes.
   ``We've got to all stop this pretense with there not being any
additional revenues. You can't do that. The realities are somewhat
different,'' he said.
   Leaders of the House and Senate have insisted that Bush's
campaign pledge not to raise taxes is unrealistic, and that new
revenues will be needed to meet deficit reduction targets. But they
are equally insistent that they will not propose new taxes on their
own _ that Bush will eventually admit the need for new federal
revenue.
   Some of the first difficult disagreements of his presidency will
ensue next month when Bush is expected to send Congress his detailed
proposals for revising the fiscal 1990 budget that Reagan submitted
on Jan. 9.
   But even when conflict comes, Democrats predicted it would be
less acrimonious than the often sharp battles with Reagan.
   ``I think Bush understands the Congress and the need for working
with cooperation,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., former majority
leader and the new chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   ``We've had too much confrontation. The people will be better
served,'' he said.
   Foley said Bush's reputation for ``straightforwardness and
openness'' will serve him well on Capitol Hill.
   Craig Fuller, co-chairman of Bush's transition team, said on the
CNN program that Bush has the advantage, when compared to Reagan, of
his long year in Washington including two terms in the House.
   ``You have relationships of respect and trust on both sides that
have been built up over the years,'' he said.
   Bush based his appeal for bipartisanship largely on foreign
policy, the area of his greatest expertise.
   In his inaugural speech, Bush seemed to hint that there would be
no new money for some of the social, educational and environmental
programs he has championed. Instead, where money is needed, it will
be shifted from other spending categories or sought from
non-governmental sources, he indicated.
   ``Our funds are low,'' Bush said. ``We have a deficit to bring
down. We have more will than wallet. But will is what we need,'' he
said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said he saw ``hard times coming.''
   ``He pointed to the private sector, and to sacrifice'' as ways to
achieve some of the goals, Anthony said. ``You're going to have a
confrontation of numbers, and of policies.''
   Foley said he doubted a full-scale ``budget summit'' such as the
one with Reagan following the 1987 stock market crisis will soon
occur, although congressional leaders have already been invited to
the White House for a meeting on the deficit next week.

<HEAD>Indians Vote in Three States, 19 Injured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Voters in three Indian states cast ballots
Saturday in elections testing the popularity of Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi, and reports said at least 19 people were injured in
election-related violence.
   A success in the state polling could allow Gandhi to call early
national Parliamentary elections.
   Voting was suspended at five centers in the state of Nagaland
after clashes between rival groups left three people injured,
election officials said.
   At least 16 supporters of Gandhi's Congress Party were injured in
the key state of Tamil Nadu, United News of India reported. The news
agency also said two bombs exploded there, but there were no reports
of casualties.
   Despite the violence, election officials reported heavy turnouts
in polling for assemblies in three states, where voting will restore
local rule. The government in New Delhi imposed federal rule in the
states last year after political crises there.
   In Tamil Nadu, a southern state, an estimated 65 percent of 36
million eligible voters went to the polls, election officials said.
   An estimated 75 percent of 600,000 eligible voters in the state
of Nagaland and about 97 percent of 300,000 eligible voters in
Mizoram cast ballots.
   Results are expected Sunday.
   Saturday's elections are important for Gandhi and his party
because they faced popular regional parties in all three states.
   But the crucial test is Tamil Nadu, where more than 2,000
candidates vied for 234 seats in the state assembly.
   Gandhi must call national elections by December, but a Tamil Nadu
victory could allow him to move sooner. A loss there could give more
time to organize to the newly formed People's Party, which is trying
to unite behind Gandhi's chief rival, V.P. Singh.
   Pre-election polls showed Congress trailing the front-runner,
Muthuvel Karunanidhi and his Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party. That
party was expected to win about 120 of the 234 seats. Karunanidhi is
backed by Singh.
   Karunanidhi served as Tamil Nadu chief minister from 1967 to
1976, when he lost to M.G. Ramachandran, a popular actor who turned
to politics at the peak of his career.
   Ramachandran led Tamil Nadu for 10 years until he died December
1987.
   His death split the huge All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
Party into two factions. One is now led by his 64-year-old widow,
Janaki. The other is led his leading lady on screen who says she

<TEXT>
   On a day when much of Washington was discussing
what George Bush will or should do, a group of scholars and scarred
political veterans gathered to talk about what he can't do.
   ``Fragmentation,'' ``micromanagement,'' ``constraints,''
``stymied,'' ``encroachment'' were the terms of art at a seminar on
``The Fettered Presidency'' staged on the last full day of Ronald
Reagan's presidency by the conservative American Enterprise
Institute.
   It drew participation from old Reaganite figures such as Richard
Perle, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Robert Bork.
   Their theme, summed up by L. Gordon Crovitz, a Wall Street
Journal editorialist: ``Instead of an imperial presidency, we have
an imperial Congress, aided by an activist court.''
   The same thought popped into the head of President Bush during an
impromptu news conference Saturday on his first day in the White
House.
   ``I'm concerned, as a lot of congressmen are, as a lot of
senators are, about the erosion of presidential power,'' he said.
   He said he wanted to talked ``with reasonable members in the
Senate and the House'' about how ``to reestablish in the presidency
the firm hand that I think the Constitution gave the president.''
   The discussion at the American Enterprise Institute Thursday
celebrated the publication of a book, its cover picturing a White
House encircled by a chain, which made the same case: Congress has
managed to erode the power of the presidency and of the executive
branch and presidents from here on out should fight to regain the
power they once exercised.
   A chart showed that one legislative restriction on the
president's ability to conduct foreign affairs was enacted by
Congress between 1789 and 1900 and 37 were adopted between 1950 and
1960, but 191 passed during Reagan's eight-year watch.
   ``He leaves the office of the presidency weaker than he found it
in 1981,'' lamented Crovitz, saying Reagan had been a strong
president but an unsuccessful one ``as the keeper of the institution
of the presidency.''
   The problem of congressional usurpation of power cripples all
chief executives, he said; it would have been just as severe ``for a
President Dukakis.''
   Bork, Reagan's rejected nominee to the Supreme Court, wrote to
complain of an ``intrusive and debilitating congressional oversight
of intelligence activities'' and of Congress' ``vacillating
incursions into foreign policy'' such as the Boland amendments
restricting the use of money to help the Contras.
   He deplored, particularly, the Supreme Court's 8-1 ``unsurprising
but disappointing decision'' upholding the law under which
independent counsels are named to investigate the ethics of the
executive branch.
   Bork said presidents must fight congressional encroachments,
``perhaps by refusing to accept some restrictions even at the risk
of political damage.''
   ``It would be a prolonged and bloody fight,'' he said, ``but our
national well-being requires that it be made.''
   Kirkpatrick, Reagan's former United Nations ambassador,
complained that a Congress that wants a hand in running foreign
policy cannot keep secrets and she said secrecy is vital to
diplomacy. She deplored ``the ethic of reveal-all.''
   Perle, former assistant secretary of defense, complained that
Congress' ``micromanagement'' of the defense budget invited
wastefulness.
   Once, he said, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger wanted
to chop $600 million worth of unneeded jets from the Pentagon
budget, but swallowed hard and accepted them when told the planes
were built in the home district of a vital congressional chairman.
   And C. Boyden Gray, who is moving into the White House as
President Bush's counsel, wrote that the problem is exacerbated by a
Congress, where most seats are safe, that has become ``vulnerable to
the paralyzing effect of special interests.''
   ``Democrats and incumbents,'' he wrote, ``generally have
controlled Congress for so long that most members of Congress have
figured out how to achieve the rough equivalence of life tenure.''

<HEAD>Syrian Defense Minister Says U.S. Trooper Carried Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria's defense minister alleged that Israel duped
an American soldier into carrying the bomb that blew up a Pan Am jet
over Scotland last month. Israel called the charge ``ridiculous.''
   ``An agent of Israeli intelligence, Mossad, handed him the
bomb-laden bag to carry in return for $300,000, claiming it was
diamonds worth $500,000 needed to be smuggled into the United
States,'' Mustafa Tlass said in an interview published Saturday in
Kuwait's daily Al-Qabas.
   Reached in Damascus, Tlass confirmed the newspaper reported his
statements correctly, but he refused to give additional information.
   In Israel, Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Leil said, ``It is
ridiculous and malicious. This story shows how the Syrian leaders
are not serious toward Israel and peace in the region.''
   Syria is Israel's most vehement enemy in the Middle East. Israel
has accused Palestinian terrorists of placing the bomb and has
dismissed claims of Israeli involvement as ludicrous.
   The Syrian minister did not say where he got his information, but
he said it was known to Western investigators.
   Britain's Sunday Express newspaper, in an unattributed report
Jan. 15, said U.S. government investigators are looking into the
theory the bomb went aboard the plane with a soldier involved in a
diamond smuggling ring.
   All 259 people on board Pan Am Flight 103 were killed and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, died when the Boeing
747 fell from the sky Dec. 21.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany and stopped in
London en route to New York.
   Tlass said ``the one who carried the explosives aboard the plane
in Frankfurt was one of the American soldiers serving at a base in
West Germany and he did it unknowingly.'' He did not name the
soldier.
   British investigators determined the plane was destroyed by a
bomb placed in the luggage hold, but they have not said who was
responsible.
   Representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization have
talked of a Mossad connection, suggesting Israel planned the attack
to throw blame on the PLO and undermine a new dialogue between the
PLO and Washington.
   Suspicions also have turned on several Syrian-backed Palestinian
factions which might be trying to derail peace overtures of PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat.
   In addition, a caller claiming to represent an Iranian group
called the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution made two calls to The
Associated Press in London saying that group planted the bomb.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Dali is Near Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors treating Salvador Dali for a heart
ailment and other problems said Saturday the famed surrealist artist
appeared to be close to death.
   Dr. Carles Ponsati, Dali's chief physician, said the 84-year-old
painter has ``a great will to live ... and this is what is keeping
him alive.''
   He said Dali was not responding to treatment for heart trouble,
which has been aggravated by pneumonia, and that he needs an oxygen
mask to breathe.
   Ponsati also heads Figueras Hospital, where Dali returned
Wednesday after his condition deteriorated.
   Dr. Joan Garcia San Miguel, who treated Dali during two previous
hospital stays since November, told the Spanish news agency EFE the
painter had only ``a one-in-a-thousand chance'' of surviving his
present crisis.
   ``Even if he does, he would suffer the same again in a short
time,'' he said.
   Dali has suffered chronic heart ailments and has been in a
wheelchair since August 1984, when he suffered severe burns in a
fire in his former home in nearby La Pera.
   Afterward, he moved to quarters next to the Dali Theater-Museum
in Figueras, near the French border. He has since lived there in
seclusion, fed through a tube and watched round the clock by a team
of nurses.
   In 1986, he underwent surgery to receive a heart pacemaker.
   A founding member of the surrealist art movement, Dali is the
last of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included
Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro. Dali is best known for his eerie,
dreamlike landscapes.
   Figueras Mayor Mariano Lorca, a friend of Dali, told The
Associated Press by telephone the painter had requested he make
arrangements for Dali's burial in the inner court of the museum in
Figueras.
   The museum, a converted municipal theater, is filled with Dali's
works and crowned by giant golden eggs and a glass dome.
   Lorca said Dali also requested his body lie in state at his
Galatea Tower residence next to the museum and that a funeral
service be held in Figueras' San Pere Roman Catholic parish church,
where Dali was baptized.
   Lorca said parish priest Narcis Costabella visited Dali in the
hospital Friday and Dali asked him to return.

   Barbara Bush, on her first full day as first
lady Saturday, gathered her grandchildren around her at an inaugural
celebration for young people.
   Mrs. Bush, who has promised to focus on the needs of children
during her husband's term in office, was the honored guest at
``George to George ... Two Hundred Years,'' an historical
dramatization of American history.
   The show, designed for children, featured music, clogging, clowns
and a fife and drum band.
   The first lady, the mother of four sons and one daughter, held
one of her young grandsons on her lap for much of the performance.
   All told, 10 Bush grandchildren were in the nation's capital for
the inaugural festivities.
   Also at the performance were Mrs. Bush's daughter, Dorothy, and
two daughters-in-law, Sharon and Margaret Bush, as well as a batch
of youngsters.
   Marilyn Quayle, the wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, came to
the show with her children.

<TEXT>
   Celebrated ballerina Natalia Makarova said Saturday
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has fostered an artistic
renaissance in her homeland, which she soon will visit for the first
time since defecting in 1970.
   The dancer, speaking in an interview in her London apartment,
said she is pleased with changes in Soviet society under Gorbachev.
   ``I think he is a very courageous man. It gives a new spring for
any form of art. I think artistic life will flourish if this
progress continues.
   ``It is quite difficult for Russian people to take this freedom
because years without freedom left its imprint. But they will get
used to it, and I think it will be really great for artists to
express whatever they want to say.''
   During the interview, the day before she left on the two-week
visit, the 47-year-old ballerina wore a long, pale green scarf as a
headband, a black and white knitted top, and black pants. She smoked
a cigarette in a black holder.
   Ms. Makarova has been invited to Leningrad by her old company,
the Kirov Ballet. She trained and advanced to principal dancer with
the company before breaking away while on tour in London in
September 1970.
   ``I wanted greater artistic freedom and opportunity,'' she said.
   Granted asylum to start a new career, she became an international
star. She made her home in San Francisco, married U.S. businessman
Edward Karker and raised their son, Andrusha. He remains at home to
go to school, but Karker will accompany his wife to Leningrad.
   Ms. Makarova will make two stage appearances during her visit.
She also has been invited by the Leningrad film festival to show her
series of four one-hour programs titled ``Ballerina,'' made in
Britain to describe a ballerina's life and recently shown in the
United States.
   She said she believes she is the first Soviet artist defector to
be invited back since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.
   ``Horowitz went back to perform, but he was never a defector,''
she said.
   Pianist Vladimir Horowitz emigrated from his homeland in 1925 and
became a U.S. citizen. He returned in 1986 on a visit and performed
there.
   Asked what she had missed most in her native land, Ms. Makarova
said in heavily accented English: ``Not to be able to dance in the
Kirov, the nature of the Russian people, the Russian countryside,
not to be able to communicate.
   ``Most of all, I missed my family and friends, and it's very
important for me to see them after almost 19 years,'' she said.
   The dancer decided to stay in the West nine years after Rudolf
Nureyev quit the Kirov to defect while on tour. Mikhail Baryshnikov
followed suit four years after Ms. Makarova left.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Appeals for Brazilian Action on Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Sunday released a report
urging Brazil's government to investigate ``the widespread killing
of community leaders.''
   The report came a month after the death of environmental activist
Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, whose murder drew international
attention.
   ``Amnesty International fears that when public interest in the
murder of Chico Mendes abates, his case will follow the pattern of
cases now numbering many hundreds which remain pending because of
inconclusive or obstructed investigations,'' the report said.
   Brazilian authorities have said that Darcy da Silva, the
21-year-old son of a rancher, has confessed to the killing.
   Mendes, 42, was an internationally acclaimed ecologist who said
he received death threats from cattler ranchers for organizing
demonstrations against deforestation of the Amazon rain forest. He
was under local police protection when he was shot.
   
   Amnesty International said authorities did not investigate six
previous attempts to murder Mendes. It said he was one of five rural
trade union presidents killed in 1988.
   ``These cases are among hundreds which show the result of
governmental failure to take effective action against political
killings in rural areas,'' said the organization, which won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1977.
   ``A new wave of death threats and killings began after the
municipal elections of November 1988,'' Amnesty International said.
   ``More than 1,000 killings have occurred since 1980 in the
context of land disputes.
   ``Amnesty International's information indicates that less than 1
percent of these killings have resulted in convictions of gunmen or
of people who hired them to kill.''

   Jurors who begin deliberating alleged child
killer Joel Steinberg's fate Monday could send him to prison for
most of his remaining life even if they believe his version of what
happened to his ``adopted'' daughter.
   Even if the jurors accept Steinberg's claim that he returned home
to find 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg comatose, it is undisputed that he
virtually ignored her while she lay unconscious on the cold tiles of
their bathroom floor for several hours.
   Instead, he lay in bed with Hedda Nussbaum, his battered live-in
companion, getting high on cocaine and its derivative, crack.
   Before the jurors get the case, state Supreme Court Justice
Harold Rothwax will tell them the defendant had a parental duty to
see to the health and safety of Lisa, the girl he got illegally at
birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised as his own.
   The judge will tell them that if they find Steinberg showed
``depraved indifference'' to the first-grader's life, they may
convict him of second-degree murder, even if he never hit the child.
He could face up to 25 years to life.
   The jury can also consider first-degree manslaughter, punishable
by up to 25 years, second-degree manslaughter, a maximum of 15
years, and criminally negligent homicide, up to four years.
   ``Anything less than a verdict of second-degree murder is a
victory for the defense,'' said Steinberg lawyer Ira London.
   London and co-counsel Adrian DiLuzio say Lisa was attacked in a
jealous rage by Ms. Nussbaum, who saw the child as a rival for the
affection of the man she considered a god.
   DiLuzio says Steinberg, 47, left Lisa ``alive and well'' with Ms.
Nussbaum, whom the lawyer called ``a poor excuse for a woman and a
mother,'' when he went to dinner with a friend the evening of Nov.
1, 1987.
   DiLuzio says Steinberg returned about three hours later and found
Lisa unconscious, and even now does not know what really happened.
   The next morning, emergency medical service workers took Lisa
from Steinberg's Greenwich Village apartment to a hospital. She died
three days later.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro says it was Steinberg,
drugged with cocaine and vexed and frustrated by the child's
rebelliousness, who struck Lisa.
   ``He's a huge guy and she's a little girl and she gets knocked
out,'' Casolaro said in his summation Friday.
   ``And then he leaves the apartment and goes to get dinner,'' he
continued, ``and he comes back and does some more drugs, and he
doesn't do a thing for the next 12 hours until six in the morning
when she finally stops breathing.''
   ``These are acts of omission that put her in grave risk of
death,'' Casolaro said. ``This isn't just depraved indifference to
human life; this is monumental indifference to human life.''
   Steinberg's lawyers claimed several times during the trial that
he did not perceive the danger that Lisa was in and that he thought
she was asleep.
   And in their double-barreled summation _ part of it by London and
part by DiLuzio _ the defense lawyers asserted that even if
Steinberg had called for medical help sooner it would not have done
Lisa any good.
   This, Casolaro said, is unknowable. He said the point in any case
is that Steinberg ignored his duty to summon help for his clearly
distressed child.
   The prosecutor conceded that Steinberg didn't intend to kill the
child.
   But, he added, ``He's an adult. He knows what smashing a
6-year-old girl in the head would do. ... You have to ask, `Isn't
this the equivalent of taking a gun and shooting her in the head?' ''

<HEAD>Iranian Minister Visiting Syria To Mediate On Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati will travel to Syria on Sunday in an effort to halt
fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions in Lebanon, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Velayati's visit was expected by leaders of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah group who are optimistic about its outcome, said the
agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   On Friday, top Iranian leader Hussein Ali Montazeri called for an
end to bitter fighting between Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal
militia in which 168 people have died and 318 been wounded since
Dec. 31.
   Over the last two days the fighting has stopped, but each side
has been fortifying its positions in the southern suburbs of Beirut
and in south Lebanon near Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   The fragile truce is believed to have been arranged by Syrian
troops in charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sectors, a Lebanese
police spokesman said.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has more than 40,000
troops there, including a 7,500-strong force in Moslem-controlled
west Beirut and another 4,500 soldiers in the south Beirut slums
where the clashes erupted Dec. 31. Within a day they spread to south
Lebanon.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been locked in a struggle for control of
Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect,
since last April.
   More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since
then.
   The mainstream Amal, which is Arabic for ``hope,'' wants to
prevent Hezbollah, or Party of God, from setting up an Iranian-style
Islamic state in south Lebanon. The fighting also has strained
Syria's alliance with Iran.
   Montazeri's plea followed appeals to the warring militias from
Iranian President Ali Khamenei and Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani as well as mediation by Syrian officials.
   Velayati's trip to Damascus is the third this month by an Iranian
foreign ministry official.

<HEAD>Falling Space Debris Lights Up The Sky Across U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A spectacular light show that some mistook for a crashing
airplane or a comet when it lit up the night sky over several states
was just the body of a derelict Soviet rocket burning up in the
atmosphere, officials said Saturday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, National Weather Service and
military bureaus and bases across the Midwest and Southwest were
swamped with calls about Friday night's display, officials said.
   Sightings of the object around 9:10 p.m. EST were reported from
Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana,
Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi and Iowa, officials said.
   ``It was definitely a Soviet rocket body that was re-entering the
Earth's atmosphere,'' said Maj. Dick Adams at the North American Air
Defense Command at Colorado Springs, Colo.
   He said the rocket body that fell out of orbit was either
``destroyed in re-entry, or fragments of it have fallen to Earth and
are some place, but who knows where.'' Most such objects burn up
before hitting the ground.
   The re-entry was unusual only because it happened over land and
was visible in the night sky, Adams said.
   Robin England of Abilene, Texas, said the object ``just appeared
all of a sudden out of the south and fell straight due north and it
left a line just as straight as could be.''
   Some callers thought that was a sign of trouble.
   ``They thought a plane blew up in the sky,'' said Patsy Halfacre,
dispatcher for the Washington County, Ark., sheriff's department.
   ``It was the most horrible thing I ever saw and it scared the
heck out of me. I kept worrying, and I called the airport, and they
told me it was a satellite,'' said Katheryn Berger of Spring, Texas.
``I said `Thank God it wasn't an airplane.'''
   Others were more appreciative of the display.
   ``It was fabulous, just fascinating. I'm 57 years old and I've
never seen anything like it,'' said Jack Lippincott of Fulton, Mo.
``We had this terrific panoramic view of the thing. You could see
the reflection of the moon in the rocket body. And there were these
white and orange spots trailing along behind it at the same speed.
Then it faded off.''
   ``It was the most spectacular thing I have ever seen in the
sky,'' said Laura Kyro, an astronomer at the St. Louis (Mo.) Science
Center. ``Even better than a shuttle landing.''
   ``People were stopping their cars on the highway and about a
dozen came into our office because it is so spectacular,'' said John
Feldt, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in St. Louis.
   In Houston, David Czarnek and his 11-year-old daughter went
outside to look at the moon and the stars, but their attention was
caught by a very bright, falling light.
   ``It was real bright, a little yellowish, with a small tail,''
Czarnek said. ``The tail was shimmering, and then it went behind the
trees and we couldn't see anything.''
   ``It looked like a comet, you know,'' said Tom Wald of Atkins,
Ark. ``I just happened to walk outside at the right time and I
grabbed a camera _ but I don't think my pictures were any good. I
was so excited, I don't think I was focused too well.''

   Blacks gathered on Saturday to bury one of the two
men killed in a police shooting that sparked race riots, and police
said many of those arrested in the uprising would be kept behind
bars until after the Super Bowl.
   Elsewhere, Miami erupted in parties and hoopla for Sunday's
football extravaganza in stark contrast to the tension and violence
of last week, and police arranged for tight security at Joe Robbie
Stadium, 15 miles north of the city.
   About 150 people entered the Cathedral of St. Mary for the
funeral of Allen Blanchard, a passenger on a motorcycle whose
unarmed driver was gunned down Monday in the Overtown neighborhood
by a Hispanic police officer. Police were chasing the motorcycle for
a traffic violation.
   Blanchard, 24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle
crashed. His family made televised appeals for calm in Overtown and
Liberty City. Driver Clement Lloyd, 23, who was killed by a shot to
the head, will be buried Monday.
   Riots touched off by the shooting left one man dead, and 11
others were treated for gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were
torched and others looted in the two black neighborhoods, and 372
people were arrested, authorities said. There were less serious
disturbances in the black section of the Coconut Grove neighborhood.
   Blanchard was remembered as a youth who ``resented trouble and
violence,'' and worked with both the elderly and schoolchildren in
his native Virgin Islands.
   After the service, Blanchard's family and community leaders said
they hoped the burial would also lay to rest the tension in the
community.
   ``We would like to have peace and not have violence,'' brother
Stanley Blanchard said.
   ``The tension has somewhat dissipated. ... As of now things are
under control,'' said James Bush, president of Operation PUSH in
Miami. ``Forgiveness has already taken place. But we're not going to
forget that there's a lot of things that need to be accomplished
here in Miami before we can eradicate this type of action.''
   Another death was linked to the riots when a 66-year-old
asthmatic was found dead Friday in his Liberty City apartment of a
clogged bronchial tube. His family said he had tried unsuccessfully
to stop the burning of a grocery store, and smoke and tear gas
aggravated his condition.
   Police remained on 12-hour shifts, ready for any signs of a
rekindling of the violence, spokesman Angelo Bitsis said Saturday.
   Sgt. Michael Mazur said authorities planned to keep about 150
rioters locked up until after the Super Bowl. They were unable to
post $250 bail.
   Mazur said there will be arraignments Monday. If those arrested
plead guilty, they will be released based on time served, he said.
   Police said only people with tickets for the game between the San
Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals will be allowed past the
parking gates at the stadium.
   If protesters obstruct the entrance, they will be moved out
quickly, spokesman Jim Hutton said. Some 300 officers have been
assigned to the stadium.
   On the edge of Overtown, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy
Davis Jr. performed Friday night at the Miami Arena with a large
police presence, but no trouble. A professional basketball game at
the arena Tuesday night was canceled because of the unrest.
   Fireworks burst over Biscayne Bay on Friday night as thousands of
revelers listened to salsa and jazz bands at a shopping center and
park less than a mile from where Lloyd was shot.
   In nearby Miami Beach, 3,000 people attended a bash held by
National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle at the Stephen
Muss Convention Center.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, an activist who has led protests by blacks
in New York City and in Atlanta, addressed a gathering of about 50
supporters in Liberty City. He is known for his involvement in the
case of Tawana Brawley, the Wappingers Falls, N.Y., teen-ager who
claimed she had been raped by whites but later, with Sharpton's
backing, refused to cooperate with investigators.
   Many local black leaders have said Sharpton is unwelcome in
Miami, and police worried his visit was designed only to rekindle
violence. A half-dozen officers watched from across the street.

<TEXT>
   Police blocked roads and stopped
strangers on Saturday to prevent a vigil at the grave of a student
who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the Soviet-led
invasion.
   In the village of Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague, authorities
checked the identifications of Western reporters and Czechoslovaks
traveling on roads to the village.
   The village was the hometown of Jan Palach, who burned himself to
death in Prague's Wencenslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion
that crushed the country's Communist Party reforms of 1968.
   Czechoslovaks without Vsetaty residence permits or police
permission to pass the roadblocks were told they could not go to the
village, where the part of the cemetery where Palach is buried was
closed for ``technical reasons,'' according to a sign outside.
   The Charter 77 human rights group called the vigil at Palach's
grave, but Western reporters at Vsetaty saw no sign of them in the
village. Activist Petr Uhl said on Friday that passenger trains
traveling to Vsetaty would not stop there on Saturday.
   Uniformed police also patrolled Wenceslas Square late Saturday,
but there were no crowds gathered as there had been the previous six
evenings in the longest wave of unrest since the weeks after the
1968 invasion.
   An attempt to commemorate Palach on Jan. 15 was broken up by
police, spawning a week of demonstrations in Prague.
   The youth daily Mlada Fronta reported that police arrested 280
people during a demonstration Thursday, when truncheon-swinging riot
police charged a crowd of more than 2,000, beating several people.
   Fourteen people, including three policemen, sought medical aid
after that demonstration, Mlada Fronta said. Nine people, including
a 59-year-old man who suffered a fractured skull, were injured on
Jan. 15, it said.
   Police threats of violence and a heavy presence of riot police
dispersed a silent crowd that gathered in Wenceslas Square for a
sixth day on Friday.
   Mlada Fronta also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been
made in the past 11 days against two Prague schools, the city's
Kotva department store, the main railway station and the National
Theater.
   The reports that violence had been threatened appeared to be part
of the efforts of Communist authorities to discredit dissidents and
demonstrators.
   Mlada Fronta said all the places where bombs reportedly were
planted were searched and nothing was found.
   But Jiri Schwarz, manager of the Kotva department store, said he
knew nothing about a reported bomb threat when asked about it by a
Western reporter.
   Several calls were made to the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo
and to a Prague emergency number threatening violence against
security forces, the party daily said.
   The anonymous callers ``announced that if the police won't leave
alone the anti-state demonstration in Wenceslas Square on Friday,
firearms will be used,'' the daily said.

<HEAD>New Report Says Cycle of Native Despair Likely to Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A baby boom among Alaska's natives could herald
an increase in the rate of suicides, violent deaths and other
problems plaguing the villagers, a new report says.
   The report, released Friday by the Alaska Federation of Natives
and the University of Alaska's Institute of Social and Economic
Studies, concludes that without major steps taken by the government,
problems in the villages will likely only get worse.
   Especially troubling, the report said, is a population surge in
rural villages that will mean an increasing number of young
villagers without jobs, dependent on government benefits and at high
risk of alcoholism, suicide and violent death.
   ``During the next two decades young native adults, many of whom
have been brutalized by alcohol abuse, despair, violence and deaths
in their homes and villages, will be having their own children,''
the report said.
   ``Unless the cycle can be broken, the projected high birth rate
for young native adults will create a new generation at risk, far
more numerous than the current one.''
   The native birth rate in 1980 was twice the national average and
50 percent higher than the rate for non-natives in Alaska, the
report said. At the current rate, Alaska's native population of
75,000 is expected to double in 26 years.
   Alcoholism, accidental death and suicide are major concerns among
native Alaskans.
   Alaskans drink the equal of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per person
each year, compared with the national average of 2.88 gallons,
according to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
   Alaska has twice the national average of accidental deaths, and
70 percent are alcohol-related, according to a 1982 state report.
   Suicide rates in rural Alaska quadrupled during the past decade
and doubled in urban areas, according to the 1982 report. Officials
believe 80 percent of the suicides were alcohol-related.
   Among the recent report's conclusions:
   _A plague of alcoholism, violence and self-destruction afflicts
natives throughout Alaska.
   _Village economies, based largely on public assistance or
government jobs, cannot meet the needs of the growing native
population.
   _Despite improvements in public health, native Alaskans remain
more vulnerable to serious injury, infectious disease and violent
death than non-natives.
   The document was the first ``status report'' on Alaska natives
published in a decade, said AFN President Janie Leask.
   The report does not offer specific solutions, although Leask said
it has become obvious that many government programs intended to help
Alaska natives have failed.

   Israeli soldiers accidentally killed a
Palestinian mayor's bodyguard Saturday as protesters threw stones at
the mayor, accusing him of cooperating with Israel, Arab reporters
said.
   Also in the occupied territories, a teen-ager was killed and four
Arabs wounded in confrontations with Israeli troops. The deaths
raised to 367 the number of Palestinians killed during the
11-month-old uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died.
   Arab reporters said troops shot Yasser Karaish, 28, a bodyguard
for Ismaeel Abu Hemeid, the Israeli-appointed mayor of the West Bank
village of Yatta, eight miles south of Jerusalem.
   The reporters said Karaish was armed and protecting the mayor
from a crowd of young Palestinian nationalists throwing rocks at
Hemeid's home and accusing him of collaborating with Israel.
   Israeli troops arriving at the scene saw an armed Palestinian in
front of Hemeid's home and opened fire, accidentally killing
Karaish, Arab reporters said. It was not clear exactly what Karaish
was doing at the time he was shot or whether he had fired his gun.
   A preliminary army investigation revealed Karaish was carrying an
Uzi submachine gun, which he was licensed to carry.
   The army could not confirm whether Karaish worked as a bodyguard
for Hemeid or whether he was at the stone-throwing incident, but the
military routinely gives weapons to pro-Israeli Palestinian figures.
   A military official said Karaish saw Israeli troops coming toward
him and opened fire at the soldiers.
   ``He thought he was being attacked,'' a military official said.
``The soldiers reacted and returned fire.''
   An army spokesman said the military has sealed off the village
and is investigating.
   Arab reporters said their was no evidence Karaish opened fire
first and said the troops may have thought Karaish was a member of a
Palestinian strike force.
   Thursday, a group calling itself the ``Palestinian Popular Army''
issued a leaflet calling for attacks on soldiers and Jewish settlers.
   The PLO claims it is forming strike forces in villages and towns
throughout the occupied territories under the command of Force-17, a
unit of Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   In the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank, a teen-ager was
killed in a confrontation with Israeli troops. Arab reporters
identified the dead boy as 14-year-old Ali Ibrahim Shariefah Kenaan.
The army confirmed the death.
   Four Palestinians were wounded Saturday in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East War. In Tulkarem, a 27-year-old Palestinian was
shot in the chest with a plastic bullet and a 22-year-old Arab was
shot in the abdomen. Both were in serious condition.
   In Nablus, a 14-year-old girl was shot in the left knee while in
the Gaza Strip, a 60-year-old man was wounded in the neck after
troops opened fire with plastic bullets to disperse stone-throwing
youth.
   The army confirmed that three Palestinians were wounded in the
West Bank, and said it was investigating the Gaza incident.
   On Friday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin liberalized the army's
open-fire policies by giving officers and specially designated
soldiers permission to fire plastic bullets at stone-throwers and
Arabs setting up roadblocks.
   Previously, only officers could fire plastic bullets in
self-defense or to incapacitate leaders of violent protests.
   The army also made security sweeps in villages throughout the
occupied territories Saturday, holding over a hundred residents for
questioning, Israel radio reported.

<HEAD>Gunman Who Killed Two Officers Acted ``Bizarrely'' Before Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who wrestled away a policeman's gun
and fatally shot two officers before he was gunned down had acted
bizarrely hours earlier, police and friends said.
   Dale Randy Connors mumbled to himself Friday, looked dazed and
occasionally raised his arms in the air, said friends and street
acquaintances.
   Connors, 35, had been arrested at least twice for willful
obstruction of a thoroughfare after standing in the middle of the
street and waving his arms.
   The usually affable, easy-going Connors became violent just
before noon in the parking lot of a doughnut shop, and he later was
overheard telling one officer he had shot, ``I got you now.''
   ``Basically, he was a nice, quiet, even-tempered guy,'' said
Johnny Flamingo, 44, a friend of Connors who witnessed the
shootings. ``He was the kind of person who'd talk to you about God,
but I never saw him like this before.''
   Connors had his own apartment but was well known among the
homeless in downtown San Jose.
   ``I saw him about 7:35 this morning and he kind of mumbled,''
said Michael Williams, who said he has known Connors for six years.
``I was wondering why he didn't speak. He wasn't like that. He was a
good guy. He'd come around and have a little fun with us all the
time.''
   Officers wore black bands on their badges Saturday in memory of
their slain comrades, the first to die in the line of duty since
1985.
   The Friday shootings, witnessed by about 30 people, were partly
videotaped by San Jose State University students doing a documentary
on the homeless. It began as a routine call of a disturbance outside
Winchell's Donut House, a block from the college.
   Connors had been acting ``bizarrely,'' repeatedly challenging
people to fight and may have been accosting them for money, said
Police Chief Joseph McNamara.
   Officer Gene Simpson, 45, a 19-year veteran working an overtime
shift, approached Connors outside Winchell's, which had evicted
Connors three times, and attempted to calm him down.
   Almost immediately, Connors attacked the officer. Witnesses said
the two men wrestled to the ground. But Connors managed to pull
Simpson's .357-caliber Magnum from his holster.
   Simpson ran off and called for help on his portable radio, police
said.
   Simpson ducked around cars in the parking lot in an attempt to
escape Connors. But Connors followed, shooting.
   Police said Simpson fell to the ground, either from a gunshot or
after losing his footing.
   Witness Samuel Tobias said that after the third shot, he heard
Connors tell the officer, ``I got you now.''
   As Simpson lay on the cement, Connors walked up and shot him in
the head, police said.
   Officer Gordon Silva, 39, was flagged down by a bystander and
came to Simpson's aid. However, as he climbed out of his car,
Connors ran into the street and shot him once in the stomach and
twice in the leg.
   Other officers arrived and fired at Connors, hitting him three
times in the heart and killing him instantly.
   Silva, a 17-year veteran, died several hours later.
   The blurred videotape made by the two journalism students
recorded 26 shots in 3{ minutes, with 21 of those coming during the
final 30-second volley that killed Connors.

<HEAD>Farm Giant's Complaints Prompted Commodities Exchange Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaints by a major grain processor about
corrupt commodities traders sparked a federal undercover
investigation at the nation's largest futures exchanges, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   Officials at Archer Daniels Midland Co., based in Decatur, first
approached prosecutors under U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas about two
years ago, the Chicago Tribune reported, quoting sources who were
not named.
   A security guard answering the telephone at ADM's headquarters on
Saturday said a company spokesman would not be available until
Monday.
   The ADM complaint came at a time when federal prosecutors in New
York were cracking down on insider trading on Wall Street.
   The seriousness of the allegations of fraud at the Chicago Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange prompted Valukas to go
after similar corruption in his region, the newspaper said.
   The investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100
traders at the two exchanges systematically cheated customers out of
millions of dollars in executing trades.
   On Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly would neither
confirm nor deny the investigation, but the Chicago Sun-Times
reported he and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson were the lead
prosecutors on the case.
   FBI agents Richard Carlson and Michael McLoughlin began working
as trainees at ADM Investors Inc., the farm giant's commodities
trading arm, in December 1986, and then acquired seats on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the newspaper said.
   Richard Burket, an ADM vice president, told the newspaper the two
were employed by the firm, but he would not comment further.
   In addition to the undercover agents, the FBI used six traders
who were angry about alleged corruption to inform on their
colleagues at the two exchanges, the Sun-Times reported, also citing
sources it did not name.
   About a year after the investigation began, the six were wired to
record conversations on the frenzied trading floors and during
social gatherings after work, the newspaper said.
   The two exchanges were served with subpoenas Thursday demanding
records of trades.
   FBI spokeswoman Jane Koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the
investigation Friday, but two law enforcement officials in
Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed it
Thursday.
   The complaint by ADM indicates that some traders who deal in tens
of millions in futures contracts a year were victims of alleged
fraud at the exchanges.
   While Carlson and McLoughlin were trading in the Treasury bond
and soybean pits at the Board of Trade, two other FBI agents were
trading currency at the Merc, The Tribune said.
   ``Everybody is obviously concerned about what this means,'' Board
of Trade spokesman Raymond Carmichael said Friday.
   Commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which
speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices
of goods ranging from gold to Treasury bills to frozen orange juice.
   FBI agents-turned-traders recorded conversations that suggest
some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting
fair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false reports to
customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on
commissions, the Chicago Tribune has reported.
   Fourteen seats were sold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
the Chicago Board of Trade from Thursday, when the investigation was
first reported, through the end of business Friday.

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa met with other Solidarity
leaders on Saturday to draft the outlawed union's official answer to
a communist party offer to legalize the labor group.
   Solidarity representives from across Poland hoped to complete
their statement by Sunday, said Jacek Kuron, a veteran
anti-government activist.
   Attending the meeting were about 30 people, including members of
the union's executive commission chaired by Walesa and the senior
union advisers.
   Late Saturday, Walesa left the meeting and returned home for the
night, but the meeting continued. No union officials were available
for comment, but a Solidarity source said an announcement of the
meeting's results was expected Sunday.
   The urgent meeting was called by Walesa to respond to the
announcement Thursday of the ruling Polish United Workers Party of a
new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization.
Currently, the only legal trade union alliance is the
government-sanctioned OPZZ.
   The party offered to legalize Solidarity under terms to be
negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help in
reforming the economy.
   The party statement, agreed on at a stormy Central Committee
meeting earlier in the week, marked a dramatic reversal for the
party and for Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   In 1981 he declared martial law and interned thousands of people
in order to crush Solidarity, which was banned the following year.
   But the worsening economic situation and the threat of an
outburst of public unrest because of rising prices and consumer
shortages have helped persuade officials to reassess Solidarity.
   The union is now seen as a potential partner that could help
smooth the introduction of painful economic and political reforms
that both sides agree on necessary.
   At a closed-door rally Friday, Walesa said he favored beginning
as soon as possible ``round-table'' talks with the government that
would lead to legalization, because the country's problems are so
overwhelming.
   Responding to a worker saying the party always lies, Walesa said,
``I don't trust them either. But if someone gives a chance for
pluralism, I take the chance.''
   But there was some feeling among Solidarity supporters that the
government should recognize their organization immediately so Walesa
could go to the talks officially as a union representative, and not
as a private citizen.
   ``Solidarity has to be a side at the talks and not just a subject
of discussion,'' said the Rev. Henryk Jankowski, an adviser to
Walesa. ``Who is he there to represent, if not Solidarity?''
   Earlier, at a Saturday morning rally of 4,000 workers at the
Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, the leader of the shipyard Solidarity
committee, Alojzy Szablewski, appealed to Prime Minister Mieczyslaw
F. Rakowski and Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek to rescind a
decision to liquidate the yard as unprofitable.
   Such an action ``would be received with great relief by our work
force and by the whole nation,'' Szablewski said.
   Liquidation of the yard officially began Dec. 1, but outwardly
work there appears normal. Several private companies are opening up
operations that would take over parts of the yard.
   Walesa attended the rally and was applauded by his fellow workers
but did not address the crowd.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday rejected
calls to import more consumer goods to end shortages, saying it
would not force the Soviet Union to learn to manufacture its own
products.
   He also attacked speculators hoarding laundry detergent, caviar,
children's clothing and other items. A laundry soap shortage is
plaguing Soviet mothers this winter.
   ``If we take a credit of a billion dollars and buy goods for one
or two years, they will be in the market. But what will happen in
the third year?'' he asked rhetorically in a speech to the Moscow
Communist Party conference.
   ``Will we continue not to produce anything ourselves?'' he said.
   That was the government policy when the Soviet Union was enjoying
the benefits of high oil prices, Gorbachev said in excerpts
broadcast on the evening news.
   ``Instead of technical and scientific progress, instead of
stimulating the economy, all faults were covered up with the wild
sums the country got due to high oil prices,'' he said.
   That's all over now, he said. With oil prices down, ``we need to
found our own industry,'' he said. ``We can't continue selling raw
materials for Western consumer goods.''
   Television cameras showed audience members hastily scribbling
notes when Gorbachev supported his argument with the shortage of
laundry detergent and soap.
   In the first quarter of 1988, the government sold 80 tons of
laundry detergent, and there was no shortage, he said. Yet this
year, more than 200 tons has been sold, yet the soap is a rare find.
Production of soap also has grown from 50 tons to 110 tons,
Gorbachev said.
   ``Certain people are making money on the deficit, hoarding
everything from black caviar to tights for children,'' Gorbachev
charged.
   Gorbachev also rejected calls for a crackdown on his opponents.
He said it would be narrow-minded to ``employ the same old methods
we are trying to give up, which we condemn'' while trying to
democratize the country.

   The new president of the United States lobbed a
surprise proclamation at reporters as he strolled around the White
House grounds on Saturday.
   President Bush announced with great delight and drama that a
doubles tennis match will be played at the White House courts
between Bush's sons Neil and Marvin against a team of professional
tennis players who are friends of the Bushes, Chris Evert and Pam
Shriver.
   The Bush clan contains some avid tennis buffs, including the
president himself, whose games sometimes include professionals.
   ``These women, confident of their own ability, have suggested
that the Bush boys will not get over two games a set,'' Bush told
reporters who accompanied him and several children and grandchildren
for a stroll to the courts. ``Yesterday Chris Evert renewed the bet,
renewed the challenge. I am absolutely confident that the Bush boys
will get over two games a set,'' the president added.
   He predicted a ``tremendous match'' with ``a lot of hostility.''
   No date was mentioned but Bush said it would occur when spring
arrives.
   ``The pressure is mounting,'' Bush quipped.
   As to one of Bush's other athletic pursuits he disclosed that the
search is on for a location on the White House grounds for a
horseshoe pit.

   With temperatures dipping to 64 degrees
below zero Saturday, about 26,000 servicemen prepared for a mock
battle in maneuvers described as ``the premier cold weather training
exercise in the free world.''
   But participants in Brim Frost '89 may be getting too much of a
good thing.
   Overnight lows Saturday dipped to 50 degrees below zero or lower
at 11 reporting stations in Alaska, including 64 below zero at
McGrath.
   Air Force Col. John D. Hopper Jr. said orders were issued to
field commanders allowing them to suspend the exercise if weather
conditions become too severe.
   That means temperatures ranging from 30 below to 65 below.
   ``We do have some curtailment of activity this morning,'' Hopper
said Saturday, although noting that the exercise still is primarily
in its command and communication phase.
   About 26,000 servicemen, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from the
United States and Canada are participating in the $15 million
biennial arctic training exercise, which military planners called
the largest of its kind in the West.
   Among the players are the U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast
Guard, Alaska National Guard and reserve units, and Canadian land
and air forces.
   The exercise is to conclude Feb. 1.
   Maneuvers are planned at more than 17 sites around Alaska, but
the focus of the exercise will be a set piece battle between two
Army brigades on the Tanana Flats at Fort Greely, about 75 miles
southeast of Fairbanks.
   That will include a battalion-sized Canadian force dropped into
the arctic winter darkness by parachute.
   Planners said they were emphasizing safety throughout the
maneuvers.
   ``Our track record has been very good,'' said Army Maj. Gen.
Harold T. Fields Jr., in charge of land forces during the exercise.
   ``Last month, 3,500 soldiers at Fort Greely trained in weather
that was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no
serious cold-related injuries,'' Fields said.
   Army Maj. John Tilman said the bitter cold produced ice fog which
has restricted visibility in many areas. ``That has delayed some
flights and stranded some flight crews around Eielson (Air Force
Base) today,'' he said.
   ``We're also having problems with metal fatigue and rubber
fatigue on vehicles and aircraft,'' Tilman said.
   ``This kind of stuff (weather) is old hat to the military
personnel stationed in Alaska,'' he said. ``But for guys like me
from the Lower 48 (Fort McPherson, Ga.), this is quite a learning
experience. We're getting initiated fast.''

   Grieving relatives and friends gathered
at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children
slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.
   ``Although there are some people in the United States who do bad
things, most of the people in the United States do good things,''
said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School,
where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher
happened last Tuesday.
   ``The tragedy that occurred at our school could have happened
anywhere. There is no way to protect us from this kind of tragedy
... this senseless tragedy. In time, some of the cutting edge of the
pain will go away,'' Busher said.
   Her speech, at a memorial service attended by 200 people for the
four Cambodian children killed, was translated as she spoke into the
Cambodian language.
   ``Tragedy has followed you,'' state Sen. John Garamendi told the
families, refugees from a country where more than 1 million people
were killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975
communist takeover.
   The service, held in Central Methodist Church, was for 8-year-old
Oeun Lim, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old
Sokhim An.
   During the morning, a Catholic funeral mass and burial were held
for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees.
   Another memorial service for the four Cambodians was planned
Sunday at a mortuary.
   Gov. George Deukmejian planned to speak at a service Monday
morning for all five children at Stockton Civic Auditorium. People
attending that service were asked to follow a Southeast Asian
cultural tradition and wear black-and-white ribbons.
   Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a gun on himself after firing
more than 100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle at
Cleveland Elementary, where he had attended grade school, was buried
Friday in an unmarked grave in a family plot at Lodi.
   Ten of the wounded children and the wounded teacher remained
hospitalized Saturday. Three children were discharged Friday.
   Stockton police said they have located all of Purdy's close
relatives, except for his mother, identified as 43-year-old Kathy
Snyder. Police said she has had four different surnames and that
when she renewed her driver's license a year ago, she used an
address in La Mesa that turned out to be a chemical shed.

<HEAD>Gun Dealers Say AK-47 Sales Up After Stockton Schoolyard Massacre</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-School Shooting-Profile, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of AK-47 assault rifles have increased
at some gun stores since one was used in a schoolyard massacre,
dealers said.
   One gun dealer said he plans to stop stocking the weapon, and
concerns that distribution will be further restricted prompted the
sales surge, sellers said.
   ``The gun was already a popular gun,'' Al Campbell, general
manager of Western Surplus, said Friday. ``Now, everyone wants to
get it before the distribution is stopped. It's having a profound
effect on sales.''
   Patrick Purdy, 24, used a semi-automatic, Soviet-designed AK-47
rifle to shoot up an elementary schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., on
Tuesday. Five pupils were killed. Twenty-nine pupils and one teacher
were wounded.
   Purdy fired more than 100 rounds from the rifle and then killed
himself with a handgun.
   Since then there have been calls to either ban the sale of such
high-powered semiautomatic rifles or subject buyers to the same
background check and waiting period required of handgun buyers.
   Campbell said he used to sell three AK-47s a week but now is
selling at least one a day.
   Art Noroian, who said he sells the rifle for $349 at Art's Guns
in Reseda, estimated the price could go as high as $800 if sales are
restricted or the Legislature passes a law banning the gun.
   ``It's trendy,'' Noroian said. ``Everybody wants to buy the gun.
They're fun to shoot. They're outstanding to shoot. It's
exhilarating. It's just a lot of fun.''
   He said his sales of the gun also increased after the shooting,
but declined to provide figures.
   Bob Kahn, owner of B&amp;B Sales in North Hollywood and Westminster,
said he sold 4,500 AK-47s over the last year. Most of the volume was
wholesale to other dealers but there also were many retail sales, he
said.
   Sales increased as soon as the public perceived through the press
that they might be restricted, Kahn said Saturday.
   Kahn said veterans of Korea and Vietnam buy AK-47s as nostalgia
items for display and many people buy paramilitary-style weapons
because they are the latest in technology and use them for family
outings to shooting ranges.
   One Orange County dealer, Randy Garell, said he would quit
stocking the rifle at The Grant Boys store in Costa Mesa.
   ``The handwriting is on the wall that these types of weapons with
massive firepower have little true purpose,'' said Garell, who also
sells camping and outdoor gear. ``I believe they are going to be
banned eventually.''

<HEAD>Bitter Cold In New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bitterly cold air blew across New England on Saturday,
threatening wind chill temperatures as low as 50 below zero, while
one record high was posted on the northern Plains.
   A strong low pressure system east of Nova Scotia pulled gusts of
cold air across New England out of the northwest.
   Gale warnings were posted over the Atlantic Coast from Maine
through Virginia.
   The combination of wind and cold raised a threat of wind chill
readings of 30 below to 40 below zero over northern New Hampshire
and much of Maine, and to 50 below zero over Vermont, the National
Weather Service said.
   Temperatures below zero during the night combined with 25 mph
wind to make it feel like 41 below zero at Albany, N.Y., and 42
below zero at Montpelier, Vt.
   But in western South Dakota, on the edge of the Black Hills,
Rapid City warmed to a record 63 degrees near noon.
   Snow showers extended over northern Maine, and from northeastern
Ohio into western Pennsylvania.
   Snow also was scattered over northwestern Utah, the Idaho
Panhandle and western Montana.
   Rain was scattered across central Florida and over northern and
western Oregon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zero at
Limestone, Maine, to 83 at Miami. Saturday morning's low was 23
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, rain and occasional thunderstorms were forecast over
the Georgia coast and Florida. Rain also was forecast over western
Oregon, with showers scattered across the northern coast of
California. Snow showers were forecast over western and central
Montana.
   Highs in the low teens were predicted over northern Maine; in the
20s over the remainder of northern New England and northeastern New
York state; in the 30s and 40s from central New England across the
Carolinas, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi
Valley, the northern Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies
and the northern Pacific Coast; in the 70s from southern California
through southwestern Arizona, and in south-central Texas and
southern Florida; and in the 50s and 60s over the remainder of the
nation.

   Crab meat with duxelle sauce and
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts isn't the usual bill of fare for
the homeless, but that was on the menu Saturday after celebrity
chefs ousted from a fund-raising event decided to cook instead for
those who can't pay.
   ``We normally serve a very nice meal, a hot meal with either
fresh fruit salad or fresh green salad. But ... we don't serve clams
or crab. People around here got all perky about that,'' said Mitch
Snyder of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, which runs the
homeless shelter.
   A commercial event had been scheduled for Saturday night and
Sunday, charging $50 per ticket for Saturday night and $15 for the
Sunday Super Bowl party. The for-profit organization planning it, A
Taste of America, had expected to donate $150,000 to $300,000 in
profits to the homeless shelter, said spokeswomen for the sponsoring
group.
   But the event was canceled because of last-minute contract
problems with the DC Armory, they said.
   James Dalrymple, general manager of the armory, did not
immediately return a phone call to his home Saturday.
   ``Obviously, we could use the money and we're sorry that didn't
work out,'' Snyder said. ``At least people in our shelter are going
to get one nice meal.''
   The dismayed chefs, who had brought some of their food with them,
met Friday to decide what to do.
   ``We had a choice whether we should pick up and go, but we
decided we were here to help the hungry and homeless, so why don't
we?'' said John P. Hughes III, owner and chef of Windows On the
Water in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   When President and Mrs. Bush stop by his restaurant, he usually
serves them lobster-stuffed potatoes, and he had intended to make
the same dish for the A Taste of America event. But he managed to
stop the shipment of 160 pounds of lobster.
   ``It would have cost us $2,000,'' said his wife, Cynthia. ``We're
a small business. We can't absorb that.''
   John Weichman of All Seasons restaurant in Mobile, Ala., had
brought more than $500 worth of crab meat with him, and Filippo
Milone of The Pillars Restaurant, also in Mobile, who had canceled
his shipment of crab meat, offered to split the cost.
   Referring to the homeless shelter residents, Weichman said,
``Hopefully, they'll have a memorable meal and they'll realize they
ate as well as some of the fat cats.''
   There appeared to be no clash of egos as the chefs whirled around
the shelter's kitchen, directing college volunteers on the proper
way to slice potatoes, chop carrots and open and mix cans of tomato
paste with whole tomatoes.
   ``Broccoli au gratin,'' Weichman pronounced as crates of broccoli
appeared in the kitchen. ``You gotta be flexible,'' he said,
explaining the instant addition to the menu.
   ``We'll make a good pasta with crab sauce, whatever,'' said
Milone, reflecting the ad hoc menu decisions.
   In addition to the crab meat with a sauce of bell pepper, onions,
mushrooms and pimentos, the chefs prepared a dish of roasted garlic
potatoes, pasta with a red sauce as well as a lamb dish and salad.
   Chef Daniel Thiebaut of the Mauna Kea Beach Resort in Kohala
Coast, Hawaii, got his company to donate the lamb, fruit and special
colored chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.
   Snyder surveyed the busy scene in his kitchen at 2 p.m. and asked
warily, ``You can get this dinner done by 5 p.m.?''
   ``No problem,'' Weichman responded.
   Snyder, who runs the 1,400-person homeless shelter, said he
expected the residents to be thrilled by the culinary change of
pace, but some waited to be impressed.
   ``It'll probably be all right,'' said Ronnell Showell, 29, of
Washington, who, after thinking about it a moment, added, ``It
should be all right.''
   Herman Jackson, 51, also of Washington, said, ``I think it's a
very good idea. ... I'm thankful for everything we get.''
   Snyder said the money that had been expected from the commercial
event would have been used to renovate a theater next to the
shelter, a project that will cost about $250,000.
   ``We've discovered that cultural activities, theatrical
activities, are very important to the people here,'' he said.
   There are no plans to build another shelter now.
   ``We already operate the largest shelter in America,'' Snyder
said. ``We're trying to make this as complete a model as possible so
people here have the greatest chance possible to get out of here ...
to help their transition back to the real world.''

<HEAD>Soviet Deficit Could Pass U.S. Red Ink in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ballooning Soviet budget deficit could pass the
U.S. deficit in 1990, according to figures published in a Soviet
newspaper Saturday.
   Driven by the cost of the Chernobyl clean-up, a crash program to
solve shortages of housing and consumer goods, and reconstruction
after the Armenian earthquake, Soviet red ink could nearly double
next year to 100 billion rubles, or $162 billion.
   That figure, calculated by research economist O.T. Bogomolov and
reported in the newspaper Arguments and Facts, is higher than
estimates for the U.S. deficit for 1989, which range from $127
billion to $141 billion.
   Worse, it looms as a far greater percentage of the Soviet economy
_ 11 percent of gross national product compared to 3 percent to 4
percent in the United States, Bogomolov said.
   The economist blamed the deficit in part on the declining price
of oil, the Soviet Union's primary export; and the anti-alcohol
campaign, which cost $65 billion in lost tax revenue.
   He also cited ``urgent social problems,'' apparently referring to
the Soviet government's decision to boost spending on housing and
consumer goods this year to appease an unhappy population.
   In addition, the cost of reconstructing the area devastated by
the Armenian earthquake is estimated at more than $13 billion during
the next two years.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said last week that Soviet
financial problems were so pressing that even the defense budget
would have to be cut.
   The Soviet Union first admitted to a budget deficit last autumn,
saying it has been running in the red for years while telling Soviet
citizens it was producing an annual surplus. Finance Minister Boris
Gostev projected a deficit of $55 billion on a 1989 government
budget of $795 billion.
   However, some Western economists say the severity of a deficit is
determined by its proportion to the entire economy, not just the
government budget. They say that is a better indicator of how far a
nation can afford to go into debt.
   Until Saturday, the Soviet Union had not revealed the size of its
economy.
   But in reporting the 1988 economic statistics, Izvestia said
Saturday that the Soviet gross national product grew 5 percent to
$1.4 trillion dollars in 1988.
   That would be a strong increase if it did not include inflation,
but the government newspaper did not say. The Soviet Union first
acknowledged that it suffers from inflation last year, but officials
said they had not yet calculated the rate.
   Overall, Georgetown University Soviet expert Murray Feshbach
evaluated the economic performance described in the Izvestia report
as ``not enough progress _ but not failing badly either.''
   The Izvestia report said one out of 10 enterprises in the country
was losing money, and only 12 percent of high schools have a single
ersonal computer.
   Although the economic news was mixed, Feshbach noted the Soviet
Union had progressed substantially in reducing the extremely high
infant mortality rate. The national figure dropped from 25.4 to 24
deaths per 1,000 births. However, that does not include deaths in
the first six days of life.
   Tass said the infant mortality rate in Central Asia and
Kazakhstan ranges as high as 51.4 deaths per 1,000, due to
insufficient medical care and ``unfavorable conditions of women's
work.''
   Alcohol-related crime and toxic air pollution also decreased,
Feshbach said.

   Officials at a troubled District of Columbia
prison complex spent Saturday cleaning up from a series of fires
that left one prisoner dead, another injured, and gutted an
administration building.
   Inmates took advantage of a power failure that occurred Friday
night to set a series of fires, according to Corrections Department
spokeswoman Pat Wheeler.
   Two inmates were stabbed during the disturbance, a press release
issued Saturday by the D.C. Department of Corrections said. Both
were taken to Dewitt Army Hospital at nearby Fort Belvoir, where one
of the inmates was pronounced dead.
   The dead inmate was identified as Andre Drake, 26, of Washington,
D.C. The other prisoner, Jerry Gill, 36, a Shelby, N.C., native, was
taken by helicopter from Dewitt to D.C. General Hospital, where he
is listed in stable condition.
   Gill, who is eligible for parole in August 1996, is serving a
five- to 15-year sentence for rape and several other convictions.
Drake had been convicted of simple assault but was also serving two
to five years for unauthorized use of a vehicle. He would have been
eligible for parole in 1990.
   One blaze engulfed the prison's main adminstration building, as
Fairfax County, Va., firefighters refusing to enter the grounds
stood by for more than an hour. They said they were waiting until
prison guards could contain inmates who roamed the grounds freely.
   A damaged heating system, smoke and water at one of the complex's
25 dormitories forced prison officials to move about 60 prisoners to
the D.C. Jail. Officials have said the prisoners will probably spend
another night there.
   Damage estimates from the fires have not been released.
   The prison _ one of 10 correctional institutions in the Lorton
complex _ is about 20 miles south of Washington and held 6,165
prisoners last month.
   District Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who came to the city-run
prison complex from a presidential inaugural celebration at the
city's convention center by helicopter, downplayed the incident.
Barry was accompanied by his wife, Effi.
   Rating the incident at two ``on a scale of one to 10,'' Barry
said, ``it could have been a lot worse.''
   Corrections officials said a power outage had briefly knocked out
the lights at the facility.
   William Falls, an operations manager at the Virginia Power
Company said Saturday that about 620 customers in the nearby
Occoquan area of Prince William County, Va. loss power from 9:15
p.m. until about 10:13 p.m. Friday. But he said he had not been
notified that the prison had experienced an outage.
   At least four fires were set during the incident, according to
Lt. Mike Reilly, spokesman for the Fairfax County fire department.
Ms. Wheeler said the fires which began at about 9:30 p.m. were
brought under control at about 2:30 a.m.
   One blaze destroyed the main administration building for the
medium-security central facility. One dormitory and a supply unit
also received ``minor damage,'' Ms. Wheeler said.
   Police from Fairfax County, the district and Virginia State
Police ringed the outer fences to guard against escape attempts,
county officials said. All inmates were accounted for within about
four hours after the fires started.
   Members of the D.C. police department's special operations
division and civil disturbance unit _ some on overtime duty because
of the events surrounding President Bush's inauguration _ went to
the scene, as did about a half dozen D.C. fire department units,
police said.
   The disturbance was the latest in a series of problems plaguing
the city prison system, including escapes, accusations of drug
dealing inside prison walls, disorders and years of litigation to
reduce chronic overcrowding.
   But corrections director Hallem Williams said early Saturday the
disturbance was not caused by overcrowding. ``We are in compliance
with the cap and overcrowding was not the issue,'' he said. In July
1986, fires set by inmates destroyed four dormitories at the
Occoquan area of the correctional complex. That blaze was blamed for
severely intensifying the crowding that has plagued the prison
system.

<HEAD>Dissidents Form Major Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissidents formed a major coalition
Saturday and vowed to drive out foreign forces, end U.S. influence
on the government and pursue unification talks with communist North
Korea.
   The umbrella dissident group, tentatively named the Coalition for
Democratic Movement, was inaugurated at Seoul's Yonsei University
and immediately called an anti-government rally Sunday in downtown
Seoul.
   About 3,000 supporters shouting anti-U.S. and anti-government
slogans attended the rally at Yonsei University. Riot police stood
guard outside the campus but did not intervene.
   The coalition, the largest in recent years with its members
coming from labor, religion and other circles, characterized the
government of President Roh Tae-woo as a front for military
dictatorship.
   It declared a campaign to drive out ``foreign forces'' such as
the United States and end annual joint military exercises between
the United States and South Korea to help advance unification of the
divided Korean peninsula.
   Coalition leaders stressed strategic ties with what they called
conservative opposition parties led by Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Young-sam, despite criticism of their failure to produce a single
candidate in the last presidential election.
   The two Kims have been criticized for splitting the opposition
vote and help Roh win the election in December 1987.
   Opposition parties welcomed the coalition but said it should
adopt a moderate line and oppose revolutionary changes.
   Some government officials have accused dissidents and radical
students of trying to topple the government by force and set up a
leftist regime.
   The coalition resolved to pursue unification talks with North
Korea and proposed a working-level meeting be held on March 1 at the
border truce village of Panmunjom to disscuss arrangements for
full-scale talks between South Korean and North Korean
representatives.
   The dissidents called for an end to alleged U.S. interference in
South Korean affairs and defined their goals to realize ``genuine
liberation, freedom and justice.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion forces marked the 16th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion on Saturday with demonstrations
across the country, prompting more than 400 arrests and a clash with
pro-choice activists in Michigan.
   In Maine, the lawyer who successfully argued the landmark
abortion case in 1973 said that for the first time she is seriously
concerned that the Roe vs. Wade decision may be overturned.
   Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in Arizona, Texas,
Louisiana, Michigan and California to protest the day before the
anniversary of the abortion ruling. But in Florida, about 200 people
gathered to support the legal right to an abortion.
   In Arizona, about 500 anti-abortion protesters blocked the
entrance of a Phoenix women's clinic, which led to 184 arrests,
including three for assault, police said.
   ``They were just abusive, violent people,'' said Dr. Brian
Finkel, medical director of the Metro Phoenix Women's Clinic, who
was assaulted during the protest.
   In Michigan, a fight broke out between a group of anti-abortion
demonstrators and pro-choice activists outside a Detroit clinic,
resulting in 55 arrests, police said.
   Most of those arrested outside East GYN Center were members of
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group that has been coordinating
protests nationally since this summer, said police spokeswoman
Allene Ray.
   The scuffle broke out just after 8 a.m. as 130 protesters
gathered to block the entrance to the abortion clinic, police said.
No injuries were reported, police said.
   Protests were peaceful elsewhere in Michigan.
   In California, about 200 people were arrested at an anti-abortion
demonstration in front of a family planning clinic in Sunnyvale that
attracted counterdemonstrators, police said.
   An estimated 600 people either opposed to or in favor of
abortions participated in the demonstration at the Family Planning
Alternative Clinic, police said.
   About 400 members of Bay Area Rescue, a coalition of
anti-abortion groups including many who belong to Operation Rescue,
appeared in front of the clinic at 8 a.m., chanting, singing and
attempting to block the facility's door, said police Capt. Jim
Barnett.
   In Florida, a crowd of 200 pro-choice activists listened to folk
music and speeches at the state's old Capitol in Tallahassee.
   ``I come to you at a time when women are saying we will not go
back,'' said the Rev. Reesce Joyner, a member of the North Florida
Rainbow Coalition.
   His audience carried signs with slogans like ``Keep Your Laws Off
My Body,'' ``My Body My Choice'' and ``If men could get pregnant,
abortion would be a sacrament.''
   In New Orleans, about 400 people gathered on the steps of the
Hale Boggs Federal Building for the Right to Life rally and march in
the city's central business district.
   ``We are standing here for the rights of the unborn,'' said Mary
Catherine Shanks. ``We are taking a stand against what we believe is
a criminal act made possible by Roe versus Wade 16 years ago.''
   In Texas, about 3,000 anti-abortion protesters marched through
downtown Austin Saturday and held a rally near the state Capitol.
Pro-choice activists in Texas held a later rally and candlelight
vigil on the Capitol steps.
   Their concern about a possible reversal of Roe vs. Wade stems
from the Supreme Court's intention to review a federal appeals court
ruling that struck down key provisions of a Missouri law regulating
abortions.
   ``I've never truly worried before,'' said Sarah Weddington, the

   A 7-year-old boy appointed to the city
Youth Commission after he worked for the re-election of a councilman
attended his first meeting Saturday and proposed some attacks on
poverty.
   Edward Andrews, who looked bored at times, sat through an hour of
plodding discussion by fellow commissioners and school officials on
topics such as student motivation and high school assemblies.
   But then Teddy, as he's known, rose to tackle an even more
serious subject.
   ``I propose we join together to help the poor and homeless
children,'' he said.
   His suggestions included soliciting contributions from the
University of California at Berkeley and the city Police Department;
helping ``children in need'' get haircuts; collecting books, toys
and clothing for homeless children; and distributing them in ways
that will not humiliate the youngsters.
   ``Not only will these points help the homeless and needy children
of Berkeley, they will help in the fight against drugs,'' said
Andrews. ``What if you were homeless or poor, had no clothes, shoes
or decent recreation program? Some guy comes up to you and says,
`Hey kid, I`ll give you $50 to carry my drugs.'''
   The young commissioner _ dressed in blue jeans, scuffed white
sneakers and a black sweatshirt _ said he came prepared for the
meeting, held in the gymnasium at the Martin Luther King Jr.
recreation center in Berkeley.
   He said he wrote to both the university and police about his
ideas, found two bookstores willing to donate books and persuaded
several establishments to donate haircuts.
   ``Let us show the world we can make a difference,'' he said.
   The rest of the Youth Commission endorsed his proposals and Bob
Weinbarger, director of the Berkeley Subcommittee on the Homeless,
said the youngster's ideas, among others, will be discussed at an
educational workshop for the City Council later this month.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Blaize Ousted As Party Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRENVILLE, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize was
ousted as political leader of the ruling New National Party during a
party convention vote Saturday night, and replaced with his
long-time critic, Keith Mitchell.
   The election of Mitchell, by a delegate vote of 190-154, means he
will be Grenada's next prime minister if the centrist New National
Party wins in elections due by December.
   Blaize will remain prime minister until the elections.
   Though the press was excluded from the convention, held in
Grenville on the Caribbean island's east coast, proceedings could be
heard from outside the building through a loudspeaker.
   Mitchell, 43, minister of Communications and Works, has regularly
criticized Blaize for taking major decisions without consulting his
cabinet. It had been rumored for months that he would challenge
Blaize's party leadership.
   Blaize's ouster as party leader was apparently due to his drop in
popularity, especially among the young, and his ill health. At 71,
Blaize is suffering from prostate cancer and an old spine injury. He
recently returned from several days of hospitalization in the United
States.
   Blaize, who was the party's leader since 1960, became prime
minster when his party was elected in December 1984, replacing an
interim government that had ruled since the U.S. invasion of Grenada
in October 1983.
   Blaize's party originally controlled 14 of the 15 seats in
parliament, but the defection of elected party officials due to
disputes with Blaize reduced his party's majority to nine seats.
   Defecting party members created an opposition party called the
National Demoratic Congress, which now controls the remaining six
seats.
   The invasion ousted a hard-line Marxist regime that came to power
in a bloody coup against leftist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who
was assassinated by extremist members of his own government.

   Foreign ministers from six
Southeast Asian nations said in a statement Saturday that former
Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk should lead any
future government in Cambodia.
   The statement came during a one-day meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.
   ``(The foreign ministers) reaffirmed their view on a future
government in (Cambodia) that is sovereign, independent, neutral and
non-aligned under the leadership of his Royal Highness Prince
Norodom Sihanouk,'' said the statement.
   It said the foreign ministers expressed hope intensified efforts
among the concerned parties will contribute positively to a
``comprehensive and durable political solution'' to the Cambodian
problem.
   The statement added that the ministers ``reaffirmed their
determination to work for the interests of the Cambodian people by
continuing cooperation with the Coalition Government of Democratic
Kampuchea (Cambodia).''
   The coalition, recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate
Cambodian government, comprises three resistance factions fighting
Vietnamese troops and the Phnom Penh regime, which Vietnam installed
10 years ago.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge in
Cambodia. The ultra-radical Khmer Rouge had ruled Cambodia since
1975 in a bloody reign that left at least one million dead. Sihanouk
had ruled before the Rouge.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw its forces in 1990, but
recently said it would pull out of Cambodia by September if a
political solution can be achieved.
   The Khmer Rouge remains as one of the guerrilla factions fighting
the Vietnam-backed government. Vietnam is seeking assurances that
the Khmer Rouge do not seize power after a Vietnamese withdrawal.

   A Piedmont Airlines jet whose engine fell off just
after takeoff had not yet undergone safety modifications ordered by
the Federal Aviation Administration, a federal official said
Saturday.
   The official said, however, that it was too soon to know whether
the modification could have been a factor in preventing the incident
Friday, in which no one was injured.
   The right engine tore away from the Boeing 737-200 jet on
Piedmont Flight 1480 as the plane left O'Hare International Airport.
Two months earlier, the FAA ordered all Boeing 737-200 engines to be
equipped with additional engine supports.
   ``The modification had not been performed on this airplane,''
said William Bruce, who is heading an investigation for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   The FAA order said the support could be added anytime within the
next 4,000 landings, and Bruce said he believed the aircraft had not
made that many subsequent landings.
   The engine, which fell in a field at the airport, was being
examined at O'Hare and portions of the plane's engine mount were to
be sent to Washington for analysis, he said.
   The investigation was not focusing on any one possible cause,
Bruce said at a news conference at O'Hare. He said he would be
reviewing maintenance records for the Piedmont plane, which was
built in 1981.
   Friday's incident was the second one of its type in 13 months.
   Last January, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect some
engine-mount bolts on Boeing 737-200 aircraft for cracks after an
engine fell off a USAir flight shortly after takeoff from
Philadelphia on Dec. 5, 1987, said Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman in
Seattle.
   The Boeing 737-200 has two engines, one mounted under each wing.
The plane, which can carry about 125 passengers, is designed to fly
on one engine, said David Shipley, a spokesman for USAir Inc, which
owns Piedmont.
   In both incidents, the pilots were able to land the planes with
the one remaining engine and no injuries were reported.
   But in 1979, an engine separation led to the worst air disaster
in U.S. history, when an American Airlines DC-10 crashed just after
takeoff from O'Hare, killing 273 people.

   When the Legislature convenes for its spring
session Tuesday, one freshman assemblyman plans to display an
American flag while riding to work on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
   ``To me, that ride is very important, a milestone,'' said Rep.
David Zien, 38, a Republican from Gilman and a decorated Vietnam War
veteran.
   ``I almost sacrificed my life for that flag,'' Zien said.
   The motorcycle and flag have been Zien's trademarks since his
first run for the Legislature in 1986, when he lost by 242 votes to
longtime incumbent Democrat Joseph Looby. Zien ousted Looby in the
Nov. 8 election by 1,121 votes.
   Looby said that in 1986, Zien rode around on a Japanese-made
motorcycle with an American flag in the back. It wasn't until Zien
was criticized, Looby said, that he went out and purchased a
U.S.-made Harley.
   Zien admits he drove a Japanese-made Yamaha for a brief time in
1986. He added, however, that the bike belonged to his wife, Jane.
   He said he purchased a Harley shortly after that because he had
owned several Harleys in the past ``and I happen to love Harleys.''

   Restaurant owners are taking a dim view of a
crackdown by fire inspectors, who have been by snuffing out candles
and other open flames in establishments that failed to get the
required inspection and approval.
   ``There must be another planet we can go to where they'd allow a
candlelight dinner,'' said Marlene Pulaski, general manager of the
Tin Angel, a cliffside restaurant and lounge.
   ``It all seems a little preposterous,'' said Dan Cosagrande,
owner of Brandy's restaurant. ``How am I supposed to keep a chafing
dish warm or to use butter warmers for crab legs?''
   Ed Zeliesko, co-owner of Tramps downtown, said his restaurant has
been darker since fire inspectors ordered him to remove
glass-enclosed candles from 40 tables.
   ``At first we were astounded when these guys came in with their
fire hats on,'' Zeliesko said. ``I've seen candles in every
restaurant I've eaten at, all over town. But it's really not funny
when you realize they could cost you business.''
   Violators also can be fined $1,000.
   Fire Capt. Robert Friel said if the restaurants would seek
permission, and an inspection shows they have a good sprinkler
system and fireproof construction, ``we might be able to give them
an OK.''

   Rock star Ted Nugent married a former radio
traffic reporter Saturday on a casino showroom stage with actor Kurt
Russell by his side as a groomsman.
   Nugent, 40, exchanged vows with Shemane Deziel, 26, on the
Ziegfeld Theatre stage at Bally's Reno Hotel, said Nugent's
spokesman, Mitch Schneider. It's the second marriage for both.
   The non-denominational ceremony began as Nugent entered the stage
in an antique car driven by Russell. Six showgirls in costume from
Bally's ``Hello Hollywood, Hello'' production stood behind the
wedding party during the ceremony.
   Nugent met Ms. Deziel at Detroit radio station WLLZ, where he was
a guest host and she was a traffic reporter.
   Nugent's new wife, who now works for a video production firm,
said she had never heard much of Nugent before meeting him in
October.
   ``I didn't want to get involved with a rock 'n' roller with
rumors trailing him,'' she said. ``But he was fun to be around and
intelligent-speaking and here we are.''
   Nugent, best known for his hits ``Weekend Warriors'' and ``Cat
Scratch Fever,'' is writing material for an Atlantic Records album,
Schneider said.

<HEAD>Four Wounded By Attackers In Apparent Attempt On Leader's Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men waiting to throw dynamite at a plane
carrying author and activist Mario Vargas Llosa shot and wounded
four people when their attempt was foiled, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   The daily newspaper Expreso reported the plane belonging to the
domestic airline Faucett had just landed Thursday in Pucallpa, 355
miles northeast of Lima, and was taxing to a halt when the incident
occurred.
   The incident was confirmed by the Libertad (Freedom) movement led
by Vargas LLosa, Peru's most celebrated novelist.
   Vargas Llosa has headed the Libertad movement since 1987 and with
the political parties Popular Action and Popular Christian Party
formed a center-right Democratic Front that supports the candidacy
of the writer for the 1990 presidential elections.
   Expreso said the foiled attack occurred at 8 p.m. (EST) when the
two men waited at the end of the runway where the plane slowed down
to turn and park, Expreso said.
   Some residents of a nearby shantytown heard about the presence of
two gunmen at the airport and went there to investigate, it said.
They were greeted by a round of bullets that wounded four of them,
it said.
   The attackers escaped, leaving behind dynamite that could have
been used to severely damage the aircraft, Expreso said quoting
Pucallpa police.
   Vargas LLosa visited the wounded in a local hospital Friday and
was quoted by Expreso as saying he will not surrender to terrorists'
threats.
   There are two guerrilla groups in Peru. The Maoist Shining Path
and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. A third group
the Rodrigo Franco Command, linked to the governing Aprista party,
began its attacks in 1988.
   Vargas Llosa went to Pucallpa to establish a local committee of
his movement and give a speech in a local theater.
   Vargas Llosa is the author of ``The Green House'' and
``Conversation in a Cathedral,'' and has been among those mentioned
in recent years as a possible winner of Nobel Prize in literature.

   Iran on Saturday called for the United
Nations to put pressure Iraq so that a permanent truce in the
Persian Gulf war can go into effect.
   A commentary broadcast on Tehran Radio and reported by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said a deadline should be set
for putting into effect a U.N. Security Council resolution that
calls for troop withdrawals, prisoner exchanges and peace talks.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year gulf war took effect
Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in Geneva five days later broke
down immediately.
   The commentary, monitored in Nicosia, said the way to ensure
progress in the peace talks was for the United Nations to apply
``corrective discipline'' to Iraq.
   The commentary did not mention specific sanctions but appealed to
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to think of other
devices for implementing the resolution.''
   It also called for ``more serious international actions'' to
pressure Iraq into withdrawing from Iranian territory it occupied
during the war and freeing prisoners of war.
   The commentary was aired shortly before a special United Nations
envoy, Jan Eliasson, was due in Tehran in an effort to restart
stalled peace talks between the gulf war foes.
   The Swedish U.N. ambassador was to arrive in Iran on Jan. 23 and
travel to Iraq Jan. 27.
   Three rounds of peace talks have failed to resolve the deadlock
over troop pullouts to prewar borders.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 calls on Iran and Iraq to
halt `all military activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw troops
to prewar borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war and
start peace talks.
   Iran ``firmly believes a final date for execution of the
Resolution should be set,'' IRNA reported the radio as saying.
   Iraq occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory and refuses
to pull out until Iran gives up the right to search ships in the
gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iran, which has not stopped any Iraqi ship since the cease-fire,
insists that troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the peace
process.
   On Friday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iran's tactics
were blocking peace talks, citing Iran's refusal to exchange sick
and wounded POWs as a major obstacle to progress in the negotiations.
   An exchange of 1,158 sick and disabled POWs sponsored by the
International Committee for the Red Cross in November collapsed four
days after it began, amid mutual recriminations over the numbers to
be repatriated.
   A total of 155 Iraqi and 56 Iranian POWs were freed before the
operation broke down Nov. 27.
   On Saturday, a senior Red Cross official said the organization
will begin Monday repatriating 255 Iranian prisoners of war that
Iraq unilaterally decided to release earlier this month.
   The official, Arnold Luethold, told The Associated Press that a
plane chartered by the Swiss relief agency will fly about half the
Iranian prisoners to Tehran on Monday.
   He said the Iranians already have been examined by Red Cross
medical staff but declined to say whether all of them are willing to
be repatriated.
   The Red Cross says it has registered 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284
Iranian POWs but estimates the total number of prisoners at more
than 100,000.
   Before the failed November exchange, the two sides had exchanged
765 sick and wounded Iraqi and 613 Iranian POWs.

<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday it will
still try to recover billions from Ferdinand Marcos even if he dies.
A key senator said Marcos may be allowed to return if he gives back
money he allegedly stole and apologizes publicly.
   ``The government will not be prejudiced by Marcos' death,''
Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez told reporters. ``And it would be
doubly difficult for his heirs or any appointed administrator of his
estate to touch his alleged Swiss bank deposits.''
   Ordonez made the comment following reports from Hawaii that the
ousted Philippine president is in declining health and suffered a
collapsed lung Thursday.
   Concern over Marcos' health prompted a federal judge in New York
to postpone until next month a hearing on whether Marcos is too ill
to be arraigned on racketeering charges.
   Ordonez said the government could pursue its 35 civil suits
against Marcos' estate if the former president dies. President
Corazon Aquino's government has never filed criminal charges against
Marcos for fear he would demand his right to return to face his
accusers.
   Marcos has lived in exile in Hawaii since a 1986
civilian-military uprising toppled his 20-year administration and
propelled Mrs. Aquino into power. Critics say Marcos accumulated $5
billion to $10 billion during his administration.
   Also Saturday, the president of the Philippine Senate, Jovito
Salonga, said Marcos might be allowed to return home if he returns
allegedly stolen funds and issues a public apology as South Korea's
disgraced former president, Chun Doo-hwan, did last year.
   ``If Marcos decides to do a Chun Doo-hwan _ that is, make a
public apology, seek our people's forgiveness and restore his
ill-gotten wealth _ there will be enough time for the former
president and his lawyers to initiate a plea- bargaining process .
.. with the New York courts and prosecutors ... authorities in
Washington and the government of the Philippines,'' said Salonga.
   Salonga added that if Marcos ``decides to insist on his innocence
and refuses to do a Chun Doo-hwan, the Aquino government may no
longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return.''
   Chun made a public apology to his country Nov. 23, surrendered
assets worth $24 million and went into rural exile in a remote
temple.
   The Senate president, who formerly chaired a committee leading a
worldwide search for money Marcos is accused of stealing, made his
remarks to a lawyer's group in the central port city of Cebu. The
Associated Press acquired a copy of his speech in Manila.

   Thousands marched in a cold, heavy rain
through the center of this restive northern city Saturday, demanding
the government open talks with the Basque separatist group ETA.
   The march, which authorities said drew an estimated 18,000
people, was organized by the radical Basque nationalist party Herri
Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of ETA.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for more than 600 deaths since
1968, when it began fighting for independence for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   The demonstrators carried a wide banner bearing the phrase ``for
the negotiation toward peace'' and shouted slogans in favor of ETA
and for negotiations.
   The march was peaceful and guarded by national police, said Julio
Ignacio Campuzano, a spokesman of the Vizcaya province civil
governor's office.
   ETA, an acronym for Basque land and liberty in the Basque
language, declared Jan. 8 it would stop attacks for 15 days to press
the government to enter negotiations on the future of the Basque
region.
   But the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
has asked ETA for an indefinite ``cease-fire'' as a condition for
resuming talks cut off a year ago after an ETA attack, according to
a report published in the leading Madrid daily El Pais.
   El Pais, citing government sources, reported Jan. 15 the talks
were to be resumed in Algeria where Eugenio ``Antxon'' Etxebeste and
other leaders of the organization are exiled.

   Foreigners who took part in a ``peace
caravan'' demanded a government apology Saturday after military
roadblocks stopped them from reaching a U.S. naval base to stage a
protest rally.
   A joint statement of the 200 foreigners who attended the
Asia-Pacific People's Conference on Peace and Development said the
roadblocks were a ``theater of the absurd ...
   ``We demand an apology from the (President Corazon) Aquino
government, more particularly the military, over the way its foreign
guests were treated and intimidated,'' it added.
   The foreigners, mostly Australians and New Zealanders, said their
200-vehicle peace caravan was stopped Friday in 16 military and
police checkpoints in a 30-mile stretch from Clark Air Base to the
Subic Bay naval base in Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila.
   The protesters, who included prominent Filipino activists and
Australian Sen. Josephine Valentinne, planned a rally in Olongapo
but gave up the idea because the roadblocks prevented them from
reaching the naval base city before their parade permit expired at 5
p.m. Friday.
   The soldiers said they were looking for weapons and infiltrators
from communist rebel or other groups. Earlier, civilian and military
officials threatened to deport peace activists who made contact with
communist rebels.
   At least 10,000 residents of Olongapo turned out for a boisterous
pro-bases rally Friday. Most of the 150,000 Olongapo residents
depend on the base for their livelihood.
   In the statement, issued Saturday, the foreign peace activists
criticized the organizers of the pro-bases rally for playing on the
residents economic benefits from the base.
   The United States maintains six military installations in the
Philippines, and their lease expires in 1991.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, in his first full
day on the new job, pledged Saturday to remember his small-town
midwestern values and ``to live up to the awesome trust you have
placed in me.''
   Quayle spent much of his first full day as vice president at his
new home, the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory in
Washington.
   He relaxed and made final touches to the text of his first formal
speech as vice president, which he delivered at an evening ``Tribute
to Democracy'' at Constitution Hall.
   Quayle also made plans to conduct his first official acts as vice
president Monday morning.
   At the request of President Bush, Quayle is to administer oaths
of office to the new presidential and vice presidential staffs in
the White House's East Room, Quayle press secretary David Beckwith
said.
   Quayle scheduled a mid-morning meeting on Monday with
anti-abortion leaders, which Beckwith said was being held in
conjunction with the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision
upholding the right of women to have abortions.
   Quayle, his wife Marilyn and their three children planned to
return to their suburban Virginia home Sunday, Beckwith said. The
electricity in the official residence will be shut off for several
days of repairs and renovations, and they will wait a week or more
before moving back in, he said.
   Before his speech, Quayle stopped in on some of the final
inaugural events _ receptions with members of Congress and the
diplomatic corps.
   Quayle heard a performance by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir at the
Constitution Hall before delivering a speech in which he praised the
``common sense and plain wisdom of the American people.''
   ``First in the House of Representatives, then in the Senate, now
in the vice presidency, I have tried and will continue to try to
live according to the values I learned in Huntington, Indiana,''
Quayle said.
   ``And I'll work to make sure our government lives up to the
expectations of the decent, hard-working citizens of Huntington _
and of the thousands of towns and suburbs and cities across our
nation.''
   Quayle said the new administration ``will be judged, and it will
deserve to be judged, by how well it does in securing the blessings
of liberty to ourselves and extending those blessings to others.''
He said it will also be judged ``by how well we succeed in sharing
and deepening the enjoyment of the blessings of liberty here at
home.''
   ``On this first day of the Bush-Quayle administration, I pledge
to you that with every ounce of my energy and ability, I will seek
to live up to the awesome trust you have placed in me,'' he said.
   He cited the words of another former vice president from Indiana,
Thomas Riley Marshall, who once said: ``Those who know nothing are
placed in the seats of the high and mighty. The wise men remain at
home and discuss public questions on the ends of street cars and
around barber shops.''
   ``Well,'' Quayle said, ``I intend to `remain at home' in my
thinking even as I have to occupy high offices here in Washington.''
   The vice president, as he did during the campaign, reminded the
crowd that he was named for James Danforth, a friend of his parents
who was killed in service in World War II. In a prepared text he had
recalled that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
``mockingly'' referred to his name as ``J. Danforth Quayle,'' but he
omitted that in reading the speech.
   ``I bear my name proudly, ladies and gentlemen, because it
reminds me of the incalculable debt we owe to those who have
sacrificed their all so that we may live our lives in freedom and
peace,'' he said.
   Quayle and his wife danced until well past midnight at Friday
night's inaugural balls, stopping at 14 events as they crossed the
city by motorcade. At one stop Quayle told of his unease at the new
protocol that placed him ahead of former President Reagan upon
departing the inauguration.
   He said he and Marilyn ``went out behind the Bushes'' _ and then
paused as the ballroom filled with laughter over what he'd said.
   Mrs. Quayle put her hand to her face in embarrassment.
   ``Johnny Carson could do no better,'' Quayle said finally,
laughing at himself.

<HEAD>Study Finds Blacks Twice As Likely To Have Loan Applications Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are twice as likely as whites to have their
applications for home loans rejected by savings and loan
associations, a newspaper reported.
   The records of 10 million applications from savings and loans
show a lending gap so wide that in much of the country, high-income
blacks are rejected at the same rate as low-income whites, said a
report in Sunday's combined editions of The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution.
   The Journal-Constitution said it studied government records of $1
trillion in loan applications between 1983 and mid-1988 at the
nation's 3,100 savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks, which make 50 percent of U.S. home loans.
   ``On the face of it, it looks like what you have there is a great
big red flag,'' said Jerauld C. Kluckman, director of compliance
programs for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
savings and loans.
   The rejection rates were derived from computerized summaries of
loan applications sorted by race, sex and marital status in the
newspaper study.
   The raw statistics were obtained through a Freedom of Information
Act request.
   In settling a civil rights suit 10 years ago, the board agreed to
collect and analyze the statistics. Each year since, it has
collected the numbers and stored them in a computer, but never has
analyzed them, the newspaper said.
   Loan statistics do not by themselves prove discrimination, since
they reveal nothing about the debt burdens or credit histories of
applicants. But Home Loan Bank Board regulations say statistical
disparities should be examined for clues that might reveal illegal
discrimination.
   ``I can't argue with the numbers,'' said Richard Tucker, director
of the Bank Board's Office of Community Investment. ``Clearly we've
got a problem, and the powers that be have got to agree on a way to
deal with it.''
   The records show that blacks, besides being rejected more than
twice as often as whites, withdraw applications 22 percent more
often and receive no decision on loan applications 10 percent more
often.
   Counting these factors, 50 percent of blacks who fill out loan
applications receive loans, compared with 74 percent of whites.

   Six white supremacists marched through downtown
Saturday surrounded by National Guard troops in riot gear as
hundreds of angry counterdemonstrators hurled bricks, rocks and
insults at them.
   A half-dozen law enforcement officers were injured as violence
broke out along the route and in spots throughout downtown after the
march. Police reported 42 arrests.
   Two thousand police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded
the Capitol and lined the mile-long march route, trying to keep
about 1,000 counterdemonstrators away from the white supremacists.
   John Bankhead, a spokesman for the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, said the counterdemonstrators overwhelmed the
security forces at some points. The white supremacists said they
completed their march battered from being hit with debris, but
without serious injuries.
   ``I wouldn't call it a riot,'' said Public Safety Commissioner
George Napper, who was quickly surrounded by an angry crowd of about
50 people when he appeared downtown after the march. ``It's an
unusual situation that we're going to contain.''
   He told the crowd the white supremacists had a right to march,
adding, ``They're entitled to protection. it's not always easy.''
   The six marchers were among 10 white supremacists who had rallied
at the state Capitol, marking the second anniversary of clashes
between civil rights marchers and white onlookers in neighboring
Forsyth County.
   Rally organizer Richard Barrett, a Mississippi lawyer and leader
of the white supremacist Nationalist Movement, had predicted 1,000
supporters would attend his rally and march, which also was a
protest of last week's observances honoring the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   ``People ask me, `Where are your numbers?''' Barrett told the
nine supporters at the Capitol. ``How many people were at Kitty Hawk
(where the Wright brothers made their historic flight)? I don't
know, but it changed the course of history. I have the spirit of
Kitty Hawk in my heart.''
   As Barrett's group walked from the Capitol to near The Omni
sports arena, they were surrounded by riot-helmeted Guardsmen,
massed shoulder to shoulder, who covered almost a full city block.
   The Guardsmen were led by a convoy that included 12 motorcycle
officers, four police cars, two dozen officers on foot, two police
buses and two vans.
   At the end of the route, the marchers were met by dozens of
youths throwing bottles, bricks and other objects. The violence
scattered dozens of curious bystanders, including conventioneers in
town for a homebuilders trade show.
   When the convoy turned around and marched back to the Capitol,
the melee continued, with more rocks and bottles tossed at the group.
   After the march, hundreds of people milled about at spots
throughout downtown. Vandals at the Underground Atlanta shopping and
entertainment complex, which is under construction, threw building
materials.
   Police used riot shields and clubs to disperse the crowds, and
several people were seen struck by policemen wielding billy clubs.
   By sundown, the streets downtown were quiet.
   At a City Hall news conference, Napper said he thought police
handled the day's events well. He said Atlanta historically has been
able to work out its racial conflicts, adding, ``I think that's why
we haven't had the kind of situations that took place in Miami.''
   During the melee, a police officer was knocked unconscious by a
flying rock, a National Guardsman was injured by a brick that hit
his foot, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said several of its
agents were hurt, and Grady Hospital said it was treating two
officers from the state Department of Natural Resources.
   Barrett's rally and march was billed as a resumption of one
canceled at the last minute in July by police on the eve of the
Democratic National Convention. That march was canceled as about 500
counterdemonstrators gathered and police feared violence.
   As troops waited for Barrett's rally to begin, a loudspeaker
blared a song proclaiming, ``If the South would have won, we'd have
it made.''
   A few blocks away, about 1,000 people gathered at Woodruff Park
to demonstrate against the supremacists. Participants, ranging from
clean-cut Emory University students to punk rockers to street
people, were separated from the streets that the white supremacist
marchers were to take by 100 police officers.
   The counterdemonstration was organized by a New York-based group
called the Partisan Defense Committee, which bills itself as a
Trotskyist-socialist organization.
   Gene Herson, a member of the group, said it was not seeking a
violent confrontation but wanted to make a statement of its own. He
said the white supremacist march was ``a provocation in a city that
is predominantly black, has a large Jewish population and is strong
in trade unions. These are all things the Klan is against.''
   Barrett said his rally was intended to repudiate the holiday
marking King's birthday.
   ``The theme of the march is `America arise _ no King over us,''
he said earlier on the steps of the Forsyth County Courthouse in
Cumming, a virtually all-white community 40 miles north of Atlanta.
   Forsyth County officials refused to permit him to use a podium or
loudspeakers or to put up his American flag because he was denied a
permit for a full demonstration.
   ``Me without my flag is like Castro without his cigar,'' Barrett
told Sheriff Wesley Walraven.
   ``If you had a permit, we'd let you fly that little old flag all
over the place,'' Walraven said.

<HEAD>First Game In World Chess Quarterfinal Drawn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The first game in the world chess
championship candidates' quarterfinal between Kevin Spraggett of
Canada and Artur Yusipov of the Soviet Union ended in a 37-move draw
on Saturday.
   Spraggett, 34, from Montreal, is considered the underdog by most
experts in this six-game contest with Yusipov, a 29-year-old, who
plays board-three for the Soviet Union behind world champion Garri
Kasparov and the former world titleholder Anatoly Karpov.
   ``Spraggett's not the favorite, but he's not to be underrated,''
said Danny Kopec, an American international master. ``He proves that
again and again.''
   By holding the draw, with the black pieces, Spraggett now gains a
small edge because he has three remaining games to play with the
advantage of the white pieces while Yusipov has only two.
   The second game of the contest scheduled to finish Jan. 29 will
be played Sunday, with Spraggett playing white. A win scores a point
and a draw a half point.
   Yusipov gained a nagging edge from a queen's gambit, but the
Canadian managed to free his cramped position with a pawn break on
the 23rd move. With both players short of time, Yusipov forced a
draw by repeating the position.
   The winner of the contest will receive five-eighths of the
$32,000 prize fund with the loser receiving three-eighths.
   British grand master Jonathan Speelman is so far the only player
qualified for the semifinal, which is scheduled to be played in
London in October.
   The contest between former world champion Karpov and Johann
Hjartarson of Iceland will begin Jan. 28 in Seattle. The remaining
duel pits Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman with Lajos Portisch of
Hungary, which starts in the Belgian city of Antwerp on Jan. 31.
   The winner of the candidates' cycle will challenge Kasparov for
his title in autumn 1990.
   Spraggett shot to prominence in his previous qualifier with
Soviet grandmaster Andre Sokolov. Although Sokolov was expected to
crush the Canadian, Spraggett held on to tie 3-3 and defeated his
opponent in a hair-raising playoff at high speed.

<HEAD>Uranium Plant Work Continues Despite Shutdown Recommendation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction projects worth more than $80
million are in progress at the federal government's
uranium-processing plant in nearby Fernald despite recommendations
that the facility be closed by 1994.
   About 500 of the plant's 1,264 employees have finished two-thirds
of a six-year schedule of projects to replace old equipment and
improve safeguards at the 39-year-old plant.
   In contrast, only 123 of the workers were involved in cleanup of
radioactive contamination at the facility, which processes uranium
the government refines elsewhere for use in nuclear weapons.
   The construction work is defended by the plant owner, the U.S.
Department of Energy and the plant operator, Westinghouse Materials
Co. of Ohio. Both claim the projects will improve environmental
safety and production at the site 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   ``There is no construction that I am aware of that would fall
under the category of expanding production capability,'' said
Westinghouse spokesman Bob Walker. ``There are a number of
improvements and construction projects that, while related to
production, are environmental or safety-related.''
   The Energy Department scheduled $88 million worth of construction
at Fernald from 1985 to 1991. About $7 million worth of projects
that would have increased production capacity have been canceled
because demand for uranium at the plant has fallen sharply as other
government reactors have closed.
   A report by the Energy Department, known as the ``2010 Report,''
recommended closing the plant by 1994. Former President Reagan
concurred with the report and passed it along to Congress.
   The recommendation, however, has no legal force.
   ``We're supposed to maintain the feasibility of production until
we're phased out,'' Pete Kelley, a Westinghouse spokesman told The
Cincinnati Enquirer in a story published Saturday.
   Neighbors of the facility have sued the plant's former operator,
National Lead of Ohio, alleging it allowed unsafe amounts of
chemical and radioactive pollution into the atmosphere, putting
their health at risk and depleting the value of their property.
   The Energy Department has acknowledged the pollution in documents
filed in the suit pending in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.
   Critics question using money for construction on a plant the
government wants to close.
   ``It's typical. ... Money that obviously should be used for
cleanup is being frittered away on projects they admit will not be
needed,'' said Tom Carpenter, a spokesman for the Government
Accountability Project, a Washington-based lobbying group.
   Bob Alvarez, a spokesman for Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said it
makes no sense ``to pour money into revitalizing the facility when
there are problems that will just fester and get worse.''
   But Bruce Boswell of Westinghouse, the plant's president, said
the facility must be maintained in good condition because its
capacity may still be needed.
   ``Although the 2010 report says we'll operate just until 1994,
that doesn't mean everything here will be demolished then,'' Kelley
said. ``And we do have production quotas for the next few years.''

   A satellite that provides those clever moving
cloud pictures for television weather forecasts failed Saturday,
depriving customers of views of the Western United States, officials
said.
   The failure occurred aboard GOES-6, a National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration satellite that was launched in April
1983, said Milton Mortman, a shift supervisor at the agency's
satellite operations control center.
   ``It's just old age,'' Mortman said.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Al Brown said weather
map-making would be little affected.
   ``For making maps it wouldn't have that much effect,'' Brown
said, noting that forecasters rely mostly on conventional ground
data.
   ``We do things such as help them locate frontal positions ...
coming in over the ocean areas. It's sort of extra input,'' he said
of the GOES-6 data.
   Brown said partial pictures can be provided from a companion
satellite, GOES-7, that covers the Eastern United States.
   ``We'll be getting pictures from the eastern satellite.
Eventually we will move the eastern satellite over so it can cover
the entire country,'' Brown said.
   Mortman said the process of moving GOES-7, using small rockets
mounted to the satellite, would be completed around Feb. 21.
Controllers will move the GOES-7 satellite from its present position
at 80 degrees west longitude over northern South America to 108
degrees west longitude.
   GOES-6 is located at 134.5 west longitude, far out over the
Pacific Ocean. The two satellites are in stationary orbits 22,300
miles above the equator.
   Until the satellite is moved, weather-watching also will be
augmented by other existing satellites operated by NOAA and by
satellites from the European and Japanese space agencies, said
Thomas N. Pyke Jr., NOAA's assistant administrator for satellite and
information services.
   NOAA said GOES-7 will perform double duty for an estimated 18
months until mid-1990, when the next GOES satellite is expected to
be ready for launch.
   Mortman said the satellites take cloud-cover pictures in narrow
strips and then compile the pieces to give large-scale, moving views
of cloud patterns. An encoder lamp that is critical to the
compilation process failed, he said.
   ``Without the lamp you have no instrument,'' Mortman said.

   A private firecracker factory blew up in southern
China's Henan province, killing 26 people and seriously injuring 18,
the state-run radio reported Sunday.
   The blast of 15 tons of explosives, which occurred Friday, gutted
the factory located in a private house in Chenguang county, the
radio said.
   Five people were killed immediately and 21 died later in the
hospital, the report said.
   Safety standards are generally low in China's more than 90,000
small-scale private and township-run fireworks factories, and
accidents are common. China has begun drafting workplace safety
regulations but enforcement is lax.
   China's biggest holiday, Spring Festival, the celebration of the
lunar new year, occurs in early February. Fireworks and firecrackers
are used in the celebrations.
   Several cities have taken measures to restrict the use of
fireworks. Shanghai has banned fireworks from the city's center
during the holiday, which begins Feb. 6. A recent report in
Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News said railway officials were
overwhelmed with cases of people trying to smuggle fireworks onto
trains.
   Beijing police also are cracking down.
   The Chinese are believed to have invented gunpowder, the main
ingredient in fireworks, in the 9th century.

   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke led a
field of seven candidates Saturday to advance to a runoff election
for a Louisiana state House seat representing a mostly white
suburban district.
   Duke, 38, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, had 3,995 votes, or 33 percent. He ran as a Republican, but
under Louisiana's open primary system all candidates run on the same
ballot, regardless of party.
   ``The Klan is far behind me, but the effort for equal rights for
everybody is ahead of me,'' Duke said in a telephone interview
Saturday night.
   ``I think when I win this race you'll find candidates across the
state and across the country begin to talk about the issues I'm
raising,'' said Duke, whose campaign platform included such racial
issues as welfare reform to reduce black births. ``I think this is
the beginning of a change in this country.''
   Duke will meet fellow Republican John Treen in the Feb. 18
runoff. Treen, 62, brother of Louisiana's first Republican governor
since Reconstruction, came in second with 2,277 votes, or 19
percent. David Treen served four years as governor, beginning in
1980.
   In Louisiana, the top two vote-getters go into a runoff election
if no one wins a majority.
   Delton Charles, a Republican member of the Jefferson Parish
School Board, was a close third with 2,011 votes, or 17 percent.
   Treen and Charles both drew endorsements from high-profile
politicians.
   Four other candidates split the remainder of the vote. They were
Democrat Budd Olister, 1,150, or 10 percent; Republican Roger
Villere, 1,142, or 9 percent; Republican Ron Courtade, 791, or 7
percent; and Democrat Bobby Savoie, 697, or 6 percent.

<TEXT>
   The special election was to fill a seat vacated by Charles
Cusimano, who became a state judge. The district covers a
predominantly white neighborhood in Jefferson Parish, a suburb of
New Orleans.
   Duke left the Klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell
top-secret membership lists and set up the National Association for
the Advancement of White People. He calls himself a white civil
rights worker.
   But his Klan activities emerged as an issue during the state
House race with a report that he has a personal listing under the Ku
Klux Klan in the telephone directory.
   Duke said the listing was only to make it easier for people to
contact him, and offered to sign an affidavit swearing he is no
longer a Klan member.
   Duke mounted a campaign for president last year as a Democrat.
Party chairman Paul Kirk wrote to state party leaders urging them to
do everything legally possible to thwart Duke from getting any
delegates at the 1988 national convention in Atlanta.
   Duke said his presidential campaign was a protest against Jesse
Jackson's candidacy.
   The state House campaign, mostly a race of personalities that
centered on name recognition and endorsements, was mostly quiet. In
the last few days, Duke blanketed the area with large yard signs.
   His campaign echoed the issues he raised in speeches across the
nation last fall _ white supremacy through such things as welfare
reform to reduce black births.

   President Bush put a hard-rocking finish to the
weekend of inaugural parties Saturday night at a rollicking bash
where new Republican party chairman Lee Atwater jammed with a stage
full of rock 'n' roll legends, including Ron Woods, Sam Moore and
Joe Cocker.
   The new president, after giving a double thumbs-up when the
star-studded performance of ``High Heeled Sneakers'' came to an end,
mounted the stage himself and was presented with a gleaming white
guitar carrying the legend ``The Prez.''
   The 64-year-old Bush got right into the rhythm of things, trying
to follow Atwater's fingerwork on ``Soul Man,'' but it was all for
show: the gift guitar wasn't plugged in.
   At one point, the 37-year-old Atwater, an unreconstructed rhythm
and blues fan from South Carolina, dropped to his knees, then fell
back to the floor, all the while strumming his guitar.
   ``I taught Lee everything he knows about that kind of dancing,''
joked Bush, who the night before was pained to take even a few waltz
steps with the first lady. Barbara Bush and several of their
children were also at Saturday's concert, clapping and cheering
throughout.
   ``Listen, I want to get this show (to) keep going. That was
marvelous, absolutely wonderful,'' said the president. ``I know when
to shut up and I know when to say something. This is a time to shut
up.''
   The big band on stage included Steve Cropper and others from the
Blues Brothers Band. Woods once played with the Rolling Stones.
Moore was famous as part of the soul duo, Sam and Dave.
   Bush's 32-year-old son, Marvin, helped organize the rock affair.
   Earlier, Bush showed off his Lone Star boots to an appreciative
crowd at a Texas ``black tie and boots'' affair for thousands of
members of the Texas State Society at the Washington Hilton. His
footgear was black with a map of the state of Texas enameled on each
of them, and with a Lone Star flag in the middle.
   ``I want to show you my boots. I don't want Ann Richards to think
I'm not a Texan,'' said Bush, referring to the Texas state treasurer
who delivered an address mocking Bush at the Democratic National
Convention last July. She did not appear to be at the party.
   Coyly lifting his pants leg, Bush said, ``Hey, listen. Stop
whistling at me.''
   Several people yelled ``take em' off.''
   Mrs. Bush, who did not address the crowds at any of the numerous
balls she and her husband visited the night before, said, ``What I
ought to do is make George stand on his head and really show you
those boots.''
   Bush, in what was clearly the understatement of the evening, told
the 9,000 young people jammed into the Convention Center: ``This has
got to have been the most active event of the inauguration. It is
fantastic.''
   Moore presented the guitar to Bush. After trying his hand at
``Soul Man,'' he gave up and waved Atwater off.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is a dream come true. ... You're
going to hear the greatest of rhythm and blues and soul,'' Atwater
told the crowd before some of the best-known singers in the genre
took the convention center stage.
   ``Tonight is not the night for politics. ... We're going to have
the time of our lives tonight,'' said the Columbia, S.C., native who
likes to entertain friends with his own guitar playing.
   Among those who led off the show were Percy Sledge singing his
classic ``When a Man Loves a Woman,'' and Coco Taylor, the so-called
queen of the Chicago blues.
   Audience members, who paid $35 a seat, were mostly young, wearing
a range of outfits from black tie to blue jeans and casual clothes.
Behind the stage in the center of the hall party-goers packed the
dance floor to twist and jitterbug to the sounds of the 1950s and
1960s.
   In front of the stage, VIP guests sipped soft drinks at round
tables. Among those attending were Marvin Bush and Dorothy Bush
LeBlond, two of Bush's children.
   Earlier, at the black tie and boots event, Bush told his audience
and a separate overflow crowd, ``We've had a great, wonderful family
day.''
   He recalled going home to the White House on Friday night for the
first time, looking out the window and seeing people already lined
up to visit it during Saturday's open house.
   ``Here were people who spent all night out there under blankets _
or maybe not,'' he said. ``It made me realize just how important it
is to be the custodian of the people's house.''
   And Mrs. Bush, who wore a red dress with a black, lace-covered
bodice, also turned serious, saying, ``Just a minute ago, when
George said `first lady' _ I don't think so. I think I'm still
George Bush's wife and I'm darn happy to be living in the White
House.''

   President Bush called himself ``a lousy

exultant tour of inaugural balls where 60,000 Republican stalwarts
toasted his swearing-in and caroused into the wee hours today.
   During the gaudy, noisy and slightly wacky evening, Bush also
bragged about his ``fantastic'' new living quarters at the White
House and Vice President Dan Quayle had one hotel ballroom throng
erupting in laughter with an offhand remark with a double meaning.
   Bush's choice for secretary of state, James A. Baker III,
sashayed with fellow Texans beneath the Wright brothers' plane at
the National Air and Space Museum, where Crystal Gayle sang her

   It was so crowded and the air so heavy in the red-carpeted grand

sagging to the floor by the crush of more than 5,000 people around

   A tough Iranian crackdown on drug
traffickers takes effect today, with a mandatory death penalty for
anyone found with small amounts of narcotics.
   At least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month in
the fiercest crackdown since the early days of the Islamic
revolution, when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers were
rounded up and killed.
   The new campaign followed the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq
war and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships caused
by the 8-year conflict, worsening unemployment and Iran's religious
ban on alcohol.
   The laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30
grams, or just over an ounce, of heroin, codeine or morphine or
smuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish. Simple possession of opium
or hashish carries a jail term.

Vineyard that they consider sacred.
   The Indians portray Mrs. Onassis as a rich newcomer intent on
grabbing their tribal lands to round out her private summer retreat
on the resort island off Cape Cod.
   But her New York City lawyer, Alexander D. Forger, says the
former first lady has tried to deal fairly with the Indians,
offering to swap better land or buy the beach for a fair price.
   The Indians, descendants of the island's original inhabitants,
seem to be trying to take advantage of her wealth and the publicity
her name can generate, he added.

of good will by those holding Americans hostage, but will make no
concessions ``to free those precious lives.''
   ``People in the past facilitated the release of our citizens, and

   In a free-wheeling exchange with reporters, the new president
also said he intends to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday to
discuss the government's spending deficit, and has asked to address
a joint session of Congress Feb. 9. Bush hinted that would be a more
specific call to action than what he termed a ``thematic'' inaugural
address on Friday.
   ``Stay tuned. Feb. 9th, we'll have something a little different,

   By all the evidence, Wall Street is expecting
good things as George Bush begins his presidency.
   While Bush was preparing to take the oath of office last week,
the stock market climbed to new highs since the crash of 1987.
Analysts said that wasn't just a coincidence.
   ``Stock and bond prices rallied despite tight money and a growing
risk of recession,'' said Erich Heinemann, chief economist at
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   ``In part, this was a vote of confidence in the Bush brigade. Mr.
Bush has deep roots in the financial community. Perhaps he will
bring the bull back to lower Manhattan.''
   During the presidential campaign and in the period after the
election, investors seemed to change their appraisal of the former
vice president sevberal times.
   Once the conventions were over and the race came down to two
candidates, the markets registered their decided preference for Bush
over Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   But by the time the election results were in on Nov. 8, market
participants seemed to develop some misgivings. Over the next six
trading sessions, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.89 points.
   That selloff wasn't necessarily the result of second thoughts
about Bush's prospects, many analysts argued. But it did appear to
signal doubts about what any president would be able to do to shrink
the federal budget deficit without inducing a recession.
   Since then, traders evidently have grown more optimistic that
constructive action will be taken.
   ``We think the financial markets care almost as much about the
politics of the budget this year as they do about the deficit,''
said Susan Simon, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The market's worst fear is that we might have to face a
protracted stalemate with a president who won't deal.
   ``We think the poker game will be different after Reagan. Bush
has been in Congress and has more Congressional ties than Reagan
ever had, and he has said he will meet with Congress to work out a
budget.''
   Peter J. Davis Jr., Washington-watcher at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., says investors may see some surprises as the tax
and budget negotiations between the White House and Congress unfold.
   ``If Congress could get Ronald Reagan to accept a half dozen
budget packages containing tax increases, why shouldn't it expect
the same result with George Bush?'' Davis says.
   But he adds, ``Bush won't relent. In my opinion, he will prove to
be a stronger opponent of tax increases that President Reagan ever
was.''
   The new president, he notes, ``has spent much of his career in
Washington. He knows how to play the game.
   ``I do not expect Congress to bamboozle him into a tax increase,
although maybe around October he might go along with some modest
sin-tax increases if Congress offers up enough spending to go
along.''
   Political commentators have remarked that Bush has won for
himself much more of a ``honeymoon'' than anyone thought he would
get, in Washington and on Wall Street as well.
   As Heinemann put it: ``The new administration has made it plain
it will confront, not avoid, a host of long-festering issues.
   ``The federal budget, the savings and loan crisis, drug
enforcement, toxic waste, Third World debt _ the list goes on and on
_ will all get fresh, pragmatic examinations from the Bush brigade
in months to come. Actions should replace stalemate.''

<HEAD>Tensions Among Disaffected Blacks Had Been Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Super Bowl week began with Miami's civic leaders and
promoters eager to show off the vibrant city's new look _ and with
most of the black community on the sidelines, as usual.
   The black problems of disaffection, displacement, despair,
resentment, feelings of injustice and lack of hope were there
seething, but far from the national spotlight or from immediate
local concern.
   Then the confusing fatal police shooting of a black motorcyclist
on the Monday night of Martin Luther King Day, provided the spark
that quickly brought smouldering tensions to a fiery rage of violent
disturbances lasting three days.
   Now black leaders, offended by the initial local focusing on the
riot's damage to Miami's Super Bowl image instead of the reasons
behind it, say the question to them hadn't been ``Why?'' blacks
erupted again, as they did in 1980 riots and disturbances in 1982
and 1984.
   It was ``When?''
   ``Here we are once again,'' said Willie Sims, who has served on
the Dade County Community Relations Board since the 1980 rioting
aftermath. ``The black community takes all these negatives and they
store them and you've got the powder keg. It's just a question of
who would detonate it.''
   ``It is almost elementary now,'' said a weary-sounding Garth
Reeves Sr., publisher of the black-oriented Miami Times newspaper.
``We keep hoping we learn from the past; hopefully, we're coming
around to redressing our grievances.''
   Much has changed about Miami since it last was host to a Super
Bowl 10 years earlier. There is a colorful new downtown skyline, a
modern people-mover system, a Bayside marketplace of shops and
restaurants, a new downtown convention center and three new luxury
hotels; a new $50 million basketball arena. And the football game
itself will be played in a new stadium north of the city.
   A ``Cubanization'' of Miami has transformed it from a southern,
tourism-based resort to a thriving center of Latin commerce, as
refugees from Fidel Castro's revolution stopped being exiles and
exerted financial, social and political influence.
   The transformation, though, swept past blacks, who account for
between 20 percent and 25 percent of the county's nearly 1.8 million
residents. Hispanics _ chiefly Cubans _ account for about 40 percent.
   Blacks saw their neighborhoods carved up for new buildings and
roads and felt themselves slipping in the city's new tri-ethnic
structure: from perhaps second to the whites who had run Miami, to
third.
   ``It's like standing on shore and looking at a body of water,
watching the high tide constantly receding from you over a period of
10 years,'' said Arthur Teele, a black attorney. ``What you have in
Miami today is a community that has grown dynamically in a way
perhaps no other city has ever grown, and in a short time. And what
you have had is a squeezing out of the black community; socially,
economically, politically.''
   A listing in The Miami Herald last year of the city's power
brokers was filled with Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (called
Anglos here). City listings of ethnic ownership of businesses have
put black ownership in single-digit percentages.
   Black unemployment in Dade County in 1987 was 10.4 percent,
nearly double that of the two other ethnic groups. Black youth
unemployment in neighborhoods such as Overtown was estimated at 40
percent to 50 percent.
   Jobs haven't been coming in to the black community, but crack
cocaine has, and that has compounded crime.
   Sims' agency compiles a weekly neighborhood ``tension chart,''
using reports from its own staff and some 150 volunteers, ranging
from county judges to bus drivers, who are in daily contact with the
black comunity.
   Using reports on police incidents, crime and what people are
talking about, plus their own experience and sense of the community,
the Community Relations Board staffers assign black neighborhoods
numbers from 1 to 5 and watch for areas that stay near the crisis
level of 5.
   ``The levels were staying high,'' Sims said. ``That's an
indication of something seriously wrong.''
   Sims last month became alarmed by a startling series of
similarities to community concerns in 1980 before the riots that
killed 18 and did hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage.
   In late December, he said, his staff wrote to the chiefs of the
Miami and Metro-Dade police department and listed comparisons.
   For example, in 1980, several black officials were under fire,
most notably Dade County School Superintendent Johnny L. Jones who
lost his job in March 1980 after being charged with grand theft for
alleged misuse of school funds. A later conviction was overturned on
appeal, but Jones eventually served time for solicitation of perjury.
   In 1988, several black officials were under fire, including U.S.
District Judge Alcee L. Hastings, who was acquitted in a 1983
bribery trial but has been impeached by the U.S. House.
   As in 1980, when the Metro-Dade Police Department was recovering
from the indictments and trial of former officers accused of helping
a cocaine kingpin, 1988 saw Miami police struggling after the
indictments and trials of officers accused of running a drug ripoff
ring.
   In both years, Sims said, there were several instances of
controversial police shootings of black suspects and wrong-house
raids; one before the 1980 riots involved a former black
schoolteacher, while one this year involved a black minister.
   Deep-seated economic and social problems were combining with
feelings that black officials were being singled out for
persecution, that police couldn't be trusted and that they were
unfairly violent to blacks, Sims said as he reviewed the Community
Relations Board letter dated Dec. 23.
   After that letter, a federal judge in Texas ruled that Central
American immigrants couldn't be forced to stay near the border while
awaiting U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service action on their
asylum requests. That led this month to a ``buslift'' of hundreds of
Central Americans, most Nicaraguans, to Miami.
   The Cuban community, identifying with Latin refugees fleeing a
Marxist homeland, opened up their pocketbooks with donations to help
the Nicaraguans amid predictions the 100,000-strong Nicaraguan exile
community could double by year's end.
   To some blacks, who had seen more than 100,000 Cubans come into
Miami in less than five months in the 1980 Mariel Boatlift that
began a month before the race riots, this was another group coming
to crowd them further down the city ladder.
   Some compared the open-arms treatment for Nicaraguans to the fact
that many black Haitian immigrants are turned away before they reach
the Florida coast or are later deported.

   The incident that touched off last week's rioting also bore
striking similarities to events of the past.
   In 1980, the acquittal of Metro-Dade police officers charged in
the beating death of black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie sparked
riots. In 1982 there were disturbances after the fatal shooting of a
black youth by a Cuban-born Miami police officer, and in 1984 after
that officer's acquittal.
   When it came, many blacks scoffed at civic clucking over the
unfortunate timing of their rage.
   ``These people and their lives were here before the Super Bowl,''
said the Rev. Carlton Coleman of New Providence Church. ``It's wrong
to worry about the incident might hurt the Super Bowl, or will the
Heat (basketball team) play tonight? What about the people in the
Heat neighborhood (Overtown)?''
   As in the past, city leaders responded with promises of speedy,
impartial investigation of the triggering incident and help for the
underlying problems. Some black community leaders say the new
efforts will face skepticism from most blacks.
   Cuban-born Mayor Xavier Suarez has made improving black
neighborhoods a top priority since taking office three years ago,
and his predecessor, Puerto Rico-born Maurice Ferre, had made that a
theme in the last years of his 12-year tenure. Reviewing Miami's
progress in 1985, Ferre said: ``We must also be on the cutting edge
of solving problems of the poor who live in our ghettos.''
   Recent years have found increased local-government aid and loans
to spur black enterprise, job placement services aimed at blacks,
requirements that 25 percent of local-government contracts go to
blacks, and appointments of two successive black Miami city police
chiefs.
   ``But the problems are so overwhelming, that if we had kept all
our promises, it would have made no difference,'' Ferre said last
week. High-level leadership must be backed by support for blacks by
the community as a whole, he and others said.
   ``It doesn't do any good to start pointing fingers,'' said Teele,
a former Reagan administration mass transportation official and
Vietnam War hero. ``All of us must shoulder some responsibility.''
   Can the fire next time be avoided?
   ``That's the $64,000 question, ... I'm not in a position to
predict,'' Teele said. ``Not if there's not a comprehensive
commitment to respond to these repeated cries for help.''

<HEAD>Market Sometimes Cool to New Presidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the stock market is going to do well in the
first year of George Bush's presidency, it will have to give him a
warmer welcome than it has accorded the past several newcomers to
the White House.
   In 1969, when President Nixon took office, the market dropped
about 14 percent.
   After his successor, Gerald Ford, was sworn in in August 1974,
the Dow Jones industrial average went into a 200-point swoon in less
than two months.
   Jimmy Carter, in 1977, was greeted with a 10 percent decline.
Even the arrival of Ronald Reagan, with his immense popularity on
Wall Street, was followed by a 7 percent loss in 1981.
   It is a generally accepted view in the financial world that this
tendency is more than coincidence.
   A change of command presumably begets uncertainty among
investors, who pull back until they become familiar with a new
administration.
   Furthermore, new presidents often use their early months in
office to take tough measures that would be politically difficult or
awkward at any other time.
   And, as it happens, 1969, 1974 and 1981 _ though not 1977 _ were
recession years.
   As 1989 begins, the economy is growing, with few signs of a
business slump any time soon. Stock prices have rallied in the weeks
leading up to Bush's inauguration, aided by hopes that he would
bring a new touch to dealing with some old problems.
   Nevertheless, Wall Streeters are watching closely to see if past
patterns repeat themselves.
   Said Suresh Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp;
Co., ``1989 is likely to be a very difficult year for stocks and
bonds.
   ``The U.S. budget deficit is no longer improving. The U.S. has
become a net debtor, currently owing $400 billion to the rest of the
world.
   ``Capacity utilization is very tight in the manufacturing sector,
and labor shortages are beginning to surface. And there is too much
debt in all sectors of the economy.''
   Stocks shrugged off such worries in the past week. In fact, the
week's best showing came on Wednesday, in the face of a government
report that showed a larger-than-expected increase in the nation's
trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,235.36, up 9.29 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.58 to 161.16;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
4.53 to 391.62, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 3.59 at 319.52.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 161.40 million shares a day, up
from 153.57 million the week before.
   There has been much talk on Wall Street of late that President
Bush may well prove more adroit than most chief executives at
working with a Congress dominated by the opposing party.
   In particular, hopes seem to have increased that a constructive
plan for dealing with the budget deficit can be worked out.
   ``The prevailing level of optimism about good things happening in
Washington provides a good chance for disappointment, in my view,''
said Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``We must keep in mind that the pace of Congress doesn't match
Wall Street's. The certified optimists in Washington feel investors
could see action on the budget deficit by April or May at the
earliest.
   ``That is still a long time away for Wall Streeters.
   ``The stock market does not usually react well to newly elected
presidents,'' Smith concluded. But the past record suggests, he
added, that ``after the president has about six months to settle in,
the market usually likes what it is seeing.''

<HEAD>Wishful Thinking About Bush Does Funny Things to Dollar, Stocks and
Bonds</HEAD>

   Many investment strategists scrounged to devise
logical explanations for the curiously cheerful behavior of the
stock, bond and dollar markets in the face of disturbing news about
the trade deficit.
   Only a few considered the emotional, but just as potent, power of
a presidential inauguration to incite euphoria about the future,
whether justified or not.
   Perhaps the most confounding event of the past week was the
market reaction to the Commerce Department news that the trade
deficit, the most visible symbol of declining U.S. economic might,
surged to $12.51 billion in November, reflecting a 2.3 percent drop
in exports and 4.2 percent rise in imports.
   The report suggested the United States was losing the battle to
export more and import less, a struggle to avoid what some
economists see as a looming financial crisis based on America's
habit of spending beyond its means.
   It was the sort of news that in months past would have incited a
heavy selloff in the dollar and sent investors fleeing from
securities denominated in the currency, namely stocks and bonds.
News of a ballooning trade deficit was one of the elements that
played a role in the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Instead, the dollar surged in hectic trading despite efforts by
the world's central banks to stem the rise by selling dollars on the
open market. Elsewhere, the stock market rallied to a post-crash
high, interest rates eased and bond prices strengthened.
   What happened?
   Many strategists scrambling for answers now reasoned that the
dollar had been undervalued in the first place. Some said more
important economic signs, such as strong corporate profits, low
inflation and a decline in borrowing, had overshadowed the market
neurosis over the trade deficit.
   Others maintained the overall trade deficit was shrinking in
relation to the country's total economic output. A few even heralded
what they saw as the reincarnation of the historic bull market on
Wall Street.
   Dollar traders theorized the trade deficit news meant the Federal
Reserve would tighten interest rates, a signal that they should buy
dollars. But securities traders theorized that the economy was
slowing and the Fed wouldn't have to tighten interest rates, so they
bought stocks and bonds.
   Suddenly, almost everybody was finding good news in the week that
George Herbert Walker Bush would become the 41st president of the
United States, only a few months after the markets worried about his
inflexible ban on new taxes, indicating an uncertain commitment to
reducing the trade and budget deficits.
   In the chorus of enthusiasm that historically accompanies a
presidential inauguration, only a few economists raised skeptical
hands.
   ``What's happening in the financial markets is that everybody is
pretending the deficits aren't that important,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International. ``Nobody's
paying any attention to the fundamentals because the attention has
diverted to politics.''
   In other major business and economic news this past week:
   _The Labor Department said the rate of increase in consumer
prices last year totaled 4.4 percent, matching the 1987 gain. But
private economists said mild increases in energy costs last year
masked more serious inflation.
   _The Commerce Department said housing construction dropped 8.2
percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six years. But industry
analysts said the housing industry, one of the most sensitive to
economic slowdowns, remained healthy.
   _Chicago's freewheeling commodity exchanges acknowedged a major
federal sting operation to investigate possible widespread fraud.
FBI agents posing as brokers secretly taped conversations on trading
floors and reportedly implicated more than 100 people.
   _Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada
Inc. to Imperial Oil Ltd. of Canada for $3.24 billion, a key part of
the No. 3 U.S. oil company's post-bankrutpcy restructuring.

<HEAD>Why Don't We Have Serious Inflation?</HEAD>

   These are difficult times for those whose
reputations are based on forecasts of inflation. Some have been at
it for more than two years now, and month after month they wait in
vain for fulfillment.
   Again in December the official consumer price report failed them.
December prices rose just 0.3 percent, the same as in November. And
inflation for all 1988 was 4.4 percent, no higher than a year
earlier.
   Inflation of that rate isn't to be ignored, of course. If
continued, it would cut buying power in half in about 16 years.
Apply that to housing prices or education and you can see how it
might submerge many families.
   But, while undesirable, 4.4 percent inflation is tolerable for a
short period, and in fact, history shows that it is almost
impossible to avoid from time to time. It is not runaway inflation,
which some seers have forecast.
   Still suffering from the trauma of the 1970s, when inflation
trampled the economies of millions of American households, a very
large segment of the forecasting fraternity nevertheless has made it
their over-riding concern.
   For them, it is a passion. They stand high in the watchtower,
binoculars raised, peering over the distance, seeking evidence they
know must be out there. Each day they scan the horizon for ominous
shapes.
   In recent weeks they have discovered new possibilities taking
shape.
   Energy prices, for example, are likely to rise because of higher
world prices. The 1988 drought has pushed up food costs. And prices
for services, especially health care, are rising faster than product
prices.
   Moreover, industrial activity appears to be getting close to
capacity at the very time the jobless rates has been pushed down to
a 14-year low. Either one could set the inflation spiral spinning
faster.
   The Boston Co. Economic Advisors described the threat succinctly:
   ``When an economy is in a `full-employment zone,' continuing
price inflation eventually spills into wage costs which, through
downward pressure on profits, spill back into prices which, in turn
spill back into wages.''
   While worrisome, however, such items and others do not
necessarily make a case for an important rise in prices generally in
1989. Over the past few years similar scares have evaporated,
sometimes magically. True, luck was involved.
   Last year, to illustrate, oil prices fell during the year,
offsetting food price increases. The falling jobless rate did not
produce wage inflation, as widely expected. Neither did the rise in
plant and equipment usage.
   Many economists had stated confidently their belief that if
industrial activity reached 83 percent of capacity inflation would
certainly boil over. Now they have been forced to raise the critical
percentage. The exact level is still unknown, but one thing is
clear: It is not what it used to be.
   Several explanations have been offered for the economy having the
good fortune to avoid the worst fears of the pessimists:
   Greater competition in a global economy; wage restraint by labor;
more efficient production facilities placed on stream in the past
decade or so; wiser corporate management; Federal Reserve Board
restraint.
   Monetary restraint, which grew tighter throughout 1988, has
produced an economy that plods rather than races, and that slow rate
of expansion is perhaps the best defense of all against a surge of
inflation.
   Meanwhile, the pessimists are saying that events are not
unfolding logically, and that we should be getting more inflation _
if not today then certainly tomorrow.
   For many of them, destructive inflation is a presence in its
absence. They talk about it, write about it, warn about it and
confidently forecast that it will come. Maybe it will, and then
they'll be right, finally.

   Air Canada has ordered three Boeing 747-400
jetliners and placed options for four more, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes said Friday.
   The Montreal-based carrier ordered ``combi'' versions of the
aircraft. The combis can be arranged to carry additional cargo on
the passenger deck.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez did not have an exact figure for
the value of the orders, but said each 747-400 generally sells for
$110 million to $129 million, depending on configuration.
   Air Canada pegged the deal's value at 600 million Canadian
dollars, or about $505 million, but Jimenez said he thought that
might include some of the options as well as firm orders.
   The first of the Air Canada jets is scheduled to be delivered in
December 1990.
   Air Canada becomes the 22nd customer for the 747-400, the latest
version of the popular jumbo jet and the largest commercial aircraft
in the world.
   To date, Boeing has received orders for 173 of the 747-400s, and
for 887 747s of all models.

<HEAD>Turf Battle Smolders As Banks Tred Further Into Wall Street Territory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By giving banks the right to operate in an area
off limits for more than 50 years, the Federal Reserve Board
signaled willingness to let banking companies and investment houses
meet in head-on competition.
   The Fed's unanimous decision this past week authorizing five
large banks to underwrite corporate debt addressed one of the key
elements of rules designed to reduce risks identified as a cause of
bank failures during the Depression.
   Limits set by the Fed will prevent banks from challenging the
dominance of big Wall Street securities firms in the near future.
However, the decision eventually will lead to increased competition
and pinch the profitablity of debt underwriting, analysts say.
   Historical banking functions were separated from securities
businesses by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, but in modern times the
line between the two has blurred as banks have been permitted to
broaden their activities and investment houses have created
bank-like services, such as money-market accounts that work like
checking accounts.
   The ensuing turf battle has featured brokerages complaining about
banks encroaching on their territory while the banks argue that
times have changed and they should be free to participate in the
worldwide trend toward ``universal'' banking, which has led to the
creation of financial conglomerates offering a wide range of
services.
   Even though the Fed's move greatly expands the type of
underwriting banks may do, it places low limits on the quantity of
underwriting.
   Also, responding to concerns about concentrating too much power
among banks, the Fed spelled out how banks engaging in underwriting
must structure their operations. Generally, the parent bank must
refrain from involving itself too closely in operations of
securities affiliates.
   Debt underwriting is a crucial link in the process of raising
money for businesses. Corporations selling bonds depend on
underwriters to purchase them and then resell them to the public.
   For acting as a marketer in this way, underwriters collect fees
that in recent years have been shrinking as other financing methods
have gained more widespread use.
   Last year, the value of new corporate debt registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and sold to the public totaled
about $100 billion, industry estimates show.
   On deals lately, an underwriter can expect to make about $7.50
per $1,000 of face value of a long-term bond issue. So, of a $100
million bond issue, the underwriter's share would be $750,000, minus
expenses, typically netting the underwriter $500,000.
   Robert Judge, a vice president in the bond trading department of
Nikko Securities Co. International, said that as a result of the
Fed's decision, underwriters might have to settle for smaller
spreads as more competitors vie for a share of the business.
   The five banks given debt underwriting authorization also had
asked the Fed for permission to sell new issues of stock, but the
central bank withheld that power for a year, pending a review of the
banks' activities.
   The five banks are: Bankers Trust New York Corp., Chase Manhattan
Corp., Citicorp, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Security Pacific Corp.
   John J. Kriz, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said
banks will not make much of a dent in the debt underwriting business
of the giants that handle most U.S. deals.
   ``In the long term, it signifies a trend toward universal
banking, which is what we already have in most European financial
centers,'' he said, adding that in the future it will ``put severe
pressure on profits.''
   From the view of big money-center banks, the Fed's latest move
was significant only so far as it was part of the evolution of the
industry's financial powers.
   It enables them to provide a service in the United States that
some already have experience with in the Eurobond market. Judging by
the somewhat unimpressive record of U.S. banks in underwriting debt
overseas, one banking analyst who asked that his name not be used
said the Fed's decision ``won't amount to a hill of beans.''

   They find things in the dark. They check
groceries, play concertos and perform eye surgery. They are faster
than a speeding bullet and could do serious damage to a locomotive.
   Lasers have been the Superman of the electromagnetic spectrum
ever since 1960, when 33-year-old Theodore H. Maiman of Hughes
Aircraft Co. built the first one from a pink ruby.
   As they near their 30th anniversary, though, lasers have switched
from comic-book novelties to necessities that preoccupy the
technology giants of the United States, Europe and Japan.
   Lasers are not only in compact disc players and bar-code scanners
at checkout counters, they are in the phone system, carrying
long-distance calls over hair-thin glass fibers.
   Now, lasers are poised to take a quantum leap. Tiny devices
called quantum lasers herald an era in which lasers will be more
central to the technology underlying daily life.
   Experts say quantum lasers and their cousins, quantum
transistors, could make possible supercomputers the size of
baseballs, and television screens of unparalleled clarity that hang
on the wall like a painting.
   ``Quantum devices are the wave of the future. Almost all of the
research that goes on involves quantum effects in some way or
another,'' said David V. Lang, director of the solid state
electronics research lab at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
   Lasers are what some scientists call a ``killer'' technology:
Compact discs are killing vinyl records, for example, and nobody
uses copper anymore for long-distance phone lines.
   To repeat a familiar story, the Japanese are putting the
American-invented killer to use more effectively than Americans
themselves are.
   Japan's dominance of mass-market electronics gives its companies
unmatched expertise in making things small, cheap and reliable. For
example, Japanese companies dominate the market for CD players,
which use more lasers than any other product.
   ``It's a byproduct of the Japanese decision to invest in consumer
electronics. They'll find an application and find the technology to
solve it. I wish we did it here,'' said Henry Kressel, a venture
capitalist at E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Japan's twin towers of strength in lasers and semiconductors
could allow it to build the first computers in which chips are
connected by quantum laser beams instead of electricity. That
worries companies like International Business Machines Corp., which
is intensively studying quantum well lasers and quantum well
transistors.
   At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, one of America's foremost laser
research centers, Alan Huang is hoping to leapfrog the Japanese. But
he admits the competition is tough: For an early model of his
``optical computer'' he had to use a diode laser he took from a
Japanese-made CD player.
   A laser is a directed needle of light purified to one particular
color, or wavelength. In contrast, ordinary light is a jumble of
many wavelengths flying in all directions.
   ``Laser'' stands for light amplification by stimulated emission
of radiation. In a cascading effect, photons of light strike an
energized material and stimulate the release of more photons in a
synchronized pattern.
   The most powerful lasers, big enough for someone to walk inside,
are being used to attempt to fuse the nuclei of atoms in flashes of
energy a million times more intense than a nuclear blast. Sustained
nuclear fusion could be a source of clean, plentiful and cheap
electricity.
   At the other end of the scale are semiconductor diode lasers, no
bigger than a grain of salt _ the kind used in compact disc players
and the phone system. One exotic subspecies is the quantum laser.
   Scientists build quantum lasers by ``spray-painting'' atoms in a
layer cake of incredibly thin layers, some of which have impurities
added.
   The impure layers act like walls to trap electrons. Confining so
many electrons and their receptors (``holes'') to a tiny space makes
it easier to get a cascade of photons going, creating laser light.
   If a laser the size of a salt crystal were blown up to the size
of the World Trade Center in New York, a quantum well would be about
the thickness of a rug in an office, said Michael Ettenberg,
director of the optoelectronics research lab at the David Sarnoff
Research Center in Princeton, N.J.
   Quantum lasers are more precise and require less current, and
their efficiency in converting electricity to light is unmatched.
   Spectra Diode Laboratories of San Jose, Calif., recently produced
55 watts of continuous wave power from a quantum laser, a record
power output and power conversion efficiency for a semiconductor
laser, president and chief executive Donald Scifres told The
Associated Press this past week.
   Ophthalmic surgeons have used lasers since 1970 to weld detached
retinas. Later came other medical uses like excising tumors and
eliminating cataracts. Today, lasers snaked into the body on optical
fibers clean arteries and destroy urinary-tract stones.
   Lasers are used to make pinholes in the nipples of baby bottles,
study components of car exhaust and form the three-dimensional
holograms used on credit cards _ and maybe someday dollar bills.
   The military has ``Star Wars'' designs for free-electron lasers
and powerful X-ray lasers, which physicist Edward Teller has
suggested could be triggered by a nuclear blast.
   Laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space: ``People
tried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discovered
was fog and rain,'' said William Bridges of California Institute of
Technology.
   Quantum well lasers fill only one niche, but an important one.
Their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapid-fire
communication, initially for long-distance calls, later for links
between neighboring computers and eventually for the links between
chips in computers, said Robert Melcher, a laser expert for IBM in
Zurich, Switzerland.
   ``I've been in the laser game for 25 years now,'' said one
researcher, Ross A. McFarlane, of Hughes Research Laboratories in
Malibu, Calif. ``That (quantum lasers) is where the future lies.''

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s sale of its lucrative Canadian
subsidiary marked one of the final steps in a massive restructuring
since the oil giant emerged from bankruptcy law protection last
April.
   But while observers say they are impressed with the pace and
execution of Texaco's restructuring, they concede the oil giant's
future remains uncertain.
   Texaco has made major changes over the last year, selling off
major assets, reorganizing internally and shifting its focus to
exploration and production from refining and marketing.
   But despite the changes, analysts say Texaco has not been able to
formulate a clear, long-term strategy due largely to the cost and
energy that has gone into battling the power plays of a legion of
dissatisfied investors led by its largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn.
   Icahn has been pushing Texaco to boost the value of the company's
stock by selling off assets and this week indicated he might try for
a second time to wrest control of Texaco's board from management at
the May shareholders meeting. Icahn also has indicated in the past
he might mount a buyout bid for the oil giant.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company behind Exxon Corp.
and Mobil Corp., announced Friday it had signed a definitive
agreement to sell its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada Inc. to
Imperial Oil Ltd. of Canada for $34.36 a share, or $3.24 billion.
The deal was the final step in the asset-sale portion asset sale
portion of a major restructuring.
   The Canadian subsidiary fetched far more than had been
anticipated, bringing the total value of Texaco's asset sales under
its restructuring program to more than $7 billion.
   Texaco has promised to distribute $1.7 billion in proceeds from
the sales to shareholders, probably in the form of a stock buyback.
   Analysts say they don't expect Texaco to boost the amount of the
proceeds promised to shareholders, but rather raise the common
dividend to enhance shareholder value over the longer term.
   Nevertheless, now could be the perfect opportunity to weaken
shareholder support for Icahn, especially if Texaco opts for a stock
buyback, some analysts say.
   ``I believe Icahn's intention all along has been to sell, not to
buy,'' said Michael Young, an analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham
&amp; Co.
   Friday's sale included Texaco Canada's refining assets but left
intact much of its exploration and production assets in Canada as
well as in West Africa, Brazil and other areas.
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri acknowledged that the company's
focus has shifted to exploration and production side of the business.
   ``That's clearly where Texaco is going,'' Young said. ``But the
jury is still out as to whether Texaco will have success in the
exploration business.''
   In the last two years, U.S. oil production has declined by
approximately 1 million barrels a day due in mainly to a sharp drop
in oil prices, according to the American Petroleum Institute. During
that time, many major oil companies have shifted their focus to the
more profitable refining and marketing side of the industry.
   Analysts say Texaco's turn to exploration and production has
happened by default due to its financial troubles.
   Texaco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to post
a potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight
with Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil had sued claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil
Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part of the
reserve-rich Getty. In 1985 a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3
billion judgment.
   Texaco had appealed the judgment but eventually was forced by
shareholders to settle with Pennzoil for $3 billion.
   Icahn pressured Texaco into a restructuring, mainly through the
sale of assets, to boost the company's stock price after the
company's board rejected his friendly proposal to buy Texaco for $60
a share. Last year, Icahn narrowly lost proxy fight for control of
Texaco's board.
   Icahn has continued to increase his stake in Texaco and earlier
this week announced he controls 16.6 percent of the company. Icahn
also disclosed he was considering the possibility of waging another
contest for board seats at the annual shareholders meeting in May.
   Nevertheless, analysts said they were impressed with the price
and the terms of the Texaco Canada sale as well as with the pace at
which Texaco has managed to complete its restructuring.
   ``Less than a year since emerging from bankruptcy, Texaco has
been able to sell $7 billion in assets and pay down debt by $2.8
billion and improve earnings dramatically,'' said Young.
   When Texaco first announced last year that Texaco Canada would be
put on the auction block, observers speculated the company would
fetch under $3 billion. In the last several weeks, that estimate had
soared.
   In addition to the asset sales, Texaco has cut back operations
and reorganized management.
   Other major asset sales in the last year have included its 99
percent interest in the West German subsidiary, Deutsche Texaco
A.G., for $1.2 billion. Late last year, it completed the sale of 50
percent of its refining and marketing assets in 23 eastern and Gulf
of Mexico states to Saudi Arabia for $800 million. Texaco has said
it expects to realize $1.8 billion from that joint venture
partnership with the Saudis.

   Technical factors and profit-taking have
depressed the market for crude oil and refined petroleum products.
   In moderate trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, lost 42 cents to $18.86 a barrel, after rising
2 cents on Thursday.
   The contract, which was set to expire Friday, had reached a
14-month high on Wednesday after breaking the psychologically
important $19-a-barrel level. It shot up to $19.45 a barrel at one
point Thursday before falling back largely on profit-taking.
   Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Friday, February
home heating oil settled 1.15 cents lower to 52.60 cents a gallon,
after falling 0.86 cent on Thursday.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.16
cent in Thursday's session, settled at 51.78 cents a gallon Friday,
down 0.32 cent.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
Friday's price decline was mainly because of technical conditions,
which included profit-taking from the earlier rally.
   But Beutel said the downturn also appeared to show a change in
market sentiment to one of cautiousness from bullishness.
   ``It's a very jittery market right now,'' he said.
   Oil prices had risen steadily this year on the belief that the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abide
by a production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.

   Texaco Inc. said it has agreed to sell its 78
percent stake in Texaco Canada Inc. for $3.24 billion cash to
Imperial Oil Ltd. of Canada.
   The planned sale announced Friday would complete a major step in
Texaco's post-Chapter 11 restructuring. Analysts said it appeared
that Texaco would raise more money than expected from the asset
sales that are at the core of its reorganization.
   Toronto-based Imperial will pay Texaco $34.36 a share for its
94.18 million shares of Texaco Canada and agreed to make a
$34.36-a-share tender offer for the remaining 26.59 million shares
held by 4,500 minority stockholders.
   The total value of the deal for all 120.77 million Texaco Canada
shares is $4.15 billion, Texaco said.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Texaco rose 87{ cents to
$55.62{ in heavy trading. Texaco Canada closed up $1 at $34.12{ a
share on the American Stock Exchange, after a trading halt for part
of the session.
   Texaco Canada also was expected to issue special common stock
dividends Friday totaling 75 cents a share, out of which Texaco will
get $59.1 million, said Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri.
   A previously announced special dividend of $6.50 (Canadian) a
share to be issued Feb. 1 will give Texaco another $514 million, and
an additional one-for-one stock dividend issued to Texaco Canada
shareholders in the newly-formed Texaco Canada Petroleum Inc. will
raise the total value of the deal for Texaco to $3.9 billion, Maneri
said.
   Texaco Canada Petroleum was formed late last year to continue
Texaco Canada's interest in production and exploration mainly in
Brazil, West Africa and Canada. It is not part of the sale package.
   Imperial _ 70 percent owned by Exxon Corp. _ the biggest U.S. oil
company _ is Canada's largest integrated oil company, with $2.7
billion in sales in 1987 and 12,000 employees.
   Texaco Canada is that nation's fourth-largest oil company, with
3,200 employees.
   The sale package includes, among other assets, two refineries
with a combined capacity of 115,000 barrels a day and 1,800 service
stations. The sale is subject to Canadian government approval.
   Analysts said they were impressed with the price that Texaco
Canada fetched as well as with other terms of the deal.
   For example, Texaco will receive an additional $100 million if
the deal is not completed by March 10, said Michael Young, an
analyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Also, certain exploration and production properties in Alberta,
Nova Scotia and West Africa were not included in the sale as some
had expected.
   The sale could face stiff opposition from those worried about
growing corporate monopolies. However, Imperial said Friday that
discussions with antitrust officials were under way and it had
started to divest certain types of assets.
   The sale of Texaco Canada marks one of the final steps in the
massive restructuring Texaco undertook in emerging from federal
bankruptcy court protection last April.
   Texaco had hoped to raise some $5 billion in cash primarily
through the sale of assets. With Friday's sale, Texaco tops its goal
by more than $2 billion, analysts said.
   Texaco promised to issue $1.7 billion in proceeds from the sales
to shareholders after being challenged last June in a proxy contest
by its largest stockholder, takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn.
Promising the dividend helped Texaco win the proxy fight, analysts
said.
   James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive, said
Friday that announcement of the distribution would be made ``as soon
as practical.''
   Icahn again has been pressuring the company to increase the value
of its stock, partly with the dividend payments raised by the asset
sales. Sources have said Kinnear did not want to sell the lucrative
Texaco Canada but agreed to do so to win shareholder support.
   Icahn, who owns 16.6 percent of Texaco, said this week he might
mount another proxy fight to win control of Texaco's board during
the annual shareholders meeting in May if the asset sales did not
produce the shareholder benefits he wanted.
   Icahn did not return calls Friday from The Associated Press.
   Imperial beat out a string of other bidders, including Bond
Corp., owned by Australian tycoon Alan Bond, and Royal Dutch Shell
Group of the Netherlands.
