   A detective was shot to death Monday by
his former business partner in a police fund-raising business,
authorities said. The gunman was killed by shots fired by the
mortally wounded detective.
   The gunman had also apparently killed his wife earlier. Police
found her body in their home when they went to tell her that her
husband was dead, said police Lt. Paul Saucedo.
   Detective Norman Montion died of gunshot wounds suffered in the
shootout with Richard Stratton in the office of Police Officers
Promotions Inc., authorities said.
   Two office employees were wounded, one seriously.
   Stratton and Montion, both 42, were owners of the company and
had a falling-out when Montion was bought out by Stratton,
witnesses said. The company raises money for the El Paso police
officers' union and the sheriff's office.
   Police Chief John Scagno said Stratton spent Monday morning in a
bar, where he brandished his weapon in front of bar patrons before
heading to the office. Police believe he had already shot his wife
by that time.
   Stratton went to the office that afternoon and fired three shots
at Montion, who was sitting at a desk, the police chief said.
Stratton shot one employee, then another who tried to knock him
down.
   Police believe Stratton was going to fire at the fallen Montion
again when the detective pulled his .38-caliber pistol and fired
six shots, hitting Stratton at least four times.
   Montion, a 16-year veteran, was on duty at the time. Police said
they did not know why he had stopped by his business.
   Police found the body of Stratton's wife, Elva Corona Stratton,
about four hours after the office shooting. Stratton left behind
two brief notes apologizing to family members for what he was about
to do, police said.

<HEAD>Zeffirelli, Kleiber, Gruberova in `Traviata'</HEAD>

   Franco Zeffirelli's productions for the
Metropolitan Opera are lavish, contain surprises but aren't really
avant-garde. When the Met audience gets used to them and the
surprises don't surprise any more, they become favorites.
   Zeffirelli's new production of ``La Traviata,'' with the famed
German conductor Carlos Kleiber and the Czech coloratura Edita
Gruberova, bowed at the Met on Monday night.
   Kleiber made the orchestra sound smooth as silk. In Act 1, he
varied tempi _ he ended the act very fast _ but never put the
singers in jeopardy.
   One expected Miss Gruberova to be best in Act 1, where the
coloratura singing is, and less good later. However, her Act 1 was
a bit disappointing and her lyric singing in the later acts was
effective and often pianissimo.
   Her top notes are effortless but her voice in coloratura
passages has a rather hard edge. One would like Violetta to have a
more womanly quality.
   Zeffirelli begins the opera with a prologue showing Violetta on
her deathbed. Then the party begins in her house. In most
productions, her guests leave her to enter the dining room.
Zeffirelli sends her into her bedroom to be alone, achieving this
by having the outer circle of the Met's revolving stage move. Act 1
alternates between her living room and bedroom. Since Alfredo, who
just met her, marches in to sing with her, this production gives
him more nerve than may be warranted.
   Having these two rooms move in and out ultimately seems not to
add anything.
   Zeffirelli uses the same ploy in Act 3, at Flora's party. A
sumptuous ballroom becomes a small gambling room when dark back
walls slide in from the wings. The party returns to the ballroom
when the walls slide out. There, we liked the contrast and found
the change less distracting than a revolving stage.
   Act 2 is in a huge garden room with one glass side, beautiful
but reminiscent of a conservatory at a botanic garden. Act 4 has
Violetta's bedroom wall become see-through, letting revelers
outside be seen. And Violetta sings standing and sitting instead of
in bed, as in most productions. This Violetta does a minimum of
coughing and fainting all evening.
   Neil Shicoff sang Alfredo. In Act 1, he was swamped by his
soprano's larger voice. He gained vocal strength later. The lovers'
duets were never a marvelous blend. Wolfgang Brendel sang Alfredo's
father with clarity and an edge which placed his character nearer
stern than sympathetic.
   Fernando Bujones and Cynthia Harvey danced splendidly in Act 3
though their choreography was unexciting. Wendy White, a native of
Chicago, who was a 1978 winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditions
for Young Singers, made her Met debut as Flora. She managed to make
a distinct and favorable impression in that small role.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Julie Ward's charred remains were found in a
sprawling gane reserve in September 1988, four months into her
vacation in Kenya. Her father is convinced she was murdered. The
government claims she was eaten by wild animals. Chege Mbitiru and
Didrikke Schanche have covered the case, and this is their report.

<TEXT>
   One of the few things not contested during
the inquest into Julie Ward's death was that the young British
tourist was killed in one of the world's most famous wildlife
preserves.
   Just how she was killed remains a glaring question.
   Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango has promised to rule Oct. 27
whether enough evidence exists to open a murder investigation into
the 28-year-old woman's death.
   The inquest, largely the result of pressure from Ms. Ward's
father, John Ward, has run intermittently since mid-August. Ward, a
successful hotelier from Suffolk, England, has vowed to pursue the
case, whatever Mango decides.
   Ms. Ward, a wildlife photography enthusiast, was four months
into her second trip to Kenya when she disappeared Sept. 6, 1988 in
the sprawling southwestern Masai Mara Game Reserve.
   Seven days later, following an air and ground search, Ms. Ward's
Suzuki bush vehicle was found mired in a creek, well off her
intended route. Six miles away in trackless bush, searchers found
the young woman's lower jaw and charred and severed lower left leg
near a pile of ashes and partly burned personal belongings.
   Kenyan police said Ms. Ward either committed suicide or was
eaten by one of the many carnivores that inhabit the game reserve,
home to Kenya's largest lion population.
   John Ward insists his daughter was murdered, and he has spent
hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars trying to prove
it.
   Ward and his attorney, Byron Georgiadis, dismiss the suicide and
wild animal theories as absurd. They claim park employees and
police engaged in a massive cover-up _ to protect either Ms. Ward's
murderer or Kenya's lucrative tourism industry.
   Tourism earned Kenya $360 million last year and is the nation's
largest foreign exchange earner.
   Georgiadis has argued that Ms. Ward was killed by someone who
knew the Masai Mara well, who had freedom of movement there and who
could have ordered or inspired a cover-up.
   He has accused the Mara's senior game warden, Simon Makallah, of
involvement in the death.
   Makallah found Ms. Ward's remains within hours after the Suzuki
was located, and Georgiadis claims he was able to do that only
because he already knew where they were. He further claims the game
warden planted Ms. Ward's vehicle in the creek.
   ``Mr. Makallah knew where her remains were and was going there
to make sure that nothing was left, but he was with others, so when
he saw some still remained he had to `find them,''' Georgiadis said
in a closing argument Oct. 5.
   To have committed suicide, he said, Ms. Ward would have had to
hack off her left leg, cut off her head and douse her own remains
with gasoline before setting them alight.
   The wild animal theory was rejected after pathologist reports
both in Kenya and Britain determined Ms. Ward had been dismembered
with a sharp instrument and her remains subsequently burned, say
Ward and Georgiadis. Both reports determined she died Sept. 12,
1988.
   However, the Kenyan report prepared by state pathologist Dr.
Adel Yousef Shaker, which initially said Ms. Ward's remains had
been ``cleanly cut'' and that she suffered a ``sharp wound,'' was
subsequently changed by a superior.
   The altered report said instead that her remains had been
``cracked'' and ``torn'' _ injuries more indicative of an animal's
mauling.
   This report proved a key point during the inquest. Georgiadis
claimed Shaker was forced to accept the changes.
   Accepting the altered report as true, said state prosecutor Alex
Etyang, left no other possible conclusion than that Ms. Ward died
by misadventure _ implicitly endorsing the wild animal theory.
   Etyang denied there had been any sort of cover-up, but he
admitted police may have been inefficient and incompetent in their
investigation.
   Superintendent Muchiri Wanjau, a police investigator on the
case, admitted several blunders, including the failure to take
statements from rangers present where Ms. Ward last was seen or
from a Swiss film crew camped several hundred yards from where her
vehicle was found.
   He also failed to record statements made by Maasai tribesmen
camped a mile from where Ms. Ward's remains were found and who,
Georgiadis said, told police they heard a woman's screams.
   In addition to the altered post-mortem report and police
failures in the case, Georgiadis points to the forgery committed by
a game park gate keeper, David Nchoko, who wrote Ms. Ward's name in
his visitor's book the day she was supposed to have left the
preserve.
   The visitor's book with Ms. Ward's signature would have been the
only material evidence the young woman left her campsite as
intended. But confronted with a handwriting expert's testimony that
her signature had been forged, Nchoko admitted he entered it into
the book himself. He said Ms. Ward had forgotten to do so.
   ``The fact that he forged and lied brings into question the
whole edifice of the assertion that she left Sand River Gate on
Sept. 6,'' said Georgiadis.

<TEXT>
   It only took a three-day meeting for
the Communists to scrap their party, but it could take years to
remove the influence of more than four decades of Communist rule in
Hungary.
   The Communist Party, formally the Hungarian Socialist Workers'
Party, was declared dead at a historic congress a week ago that
gave birth to the Hungarian Socialist Party.
   Spurred by upcoming free elections, the congress heeded
reformers' calls for a party with democratic aspirations that would
be more appealing to the electorate than a monolithic
Marxist-Leninist party. The elections are due by June.
   Reform has been in the wind in Hungary for the past several
years, even before Mikhail S. Gorbachev decreed changes in the
Soviet Union.
   The most blatant Stalinist manifestations _ personality cults,
workers' brigades, a repressive secret police _ were done away with
under the late Janos Kadar. But real reform gathered steam only
after Kadar was retired last year after 32 years at the helm.
   The collective leadership succeeding Kadar decided
liberalization was the only way to counter serious economic
problems. It permitted political opposition to flourish for the
first time since the Communists consolidated power in 1948, and it
pledged to permit the country's first free national elections in 41
years.
   Such developments have placed Hungary on the vanguard of
democratization within the Soviet bloc along with Poland, the first
Warsaw Pact country with a primarily non-Communist government.
   The old party decided in September to begin dismantling its
government chapters, and the ministries of the interior, finance
and trade and commerce already have been formally depoliticized.
   The party formally transferred control of its armed Worker's
Militia to the government in the summer.
   After more than four decades of rewritten history, there are
plans to write it again _ this time reflecting events independent
of Marxist coloration. Education Minister Ferenc Glatz has urged
history teachers to use their own judgment in the classroom instead
of old party dictates.
   Dozens of independent newspapers and periodicals have blossomed
and are as free with criticism of the government and the party as
any in the West. Private radio, a British-Hungarian commercial
venture, began functioning in June.
   Yet old habits die hard.
   The premier and all but one of his ministers were ranking
members of the old party, and most remain in the top levels of the
new one.
   About 85 percent of senior officials in the Interior Ministry,
which controls the police, were Communist Party members, according
to the independent weekly Heti Vilaggazdasag. In the Ministry of
Trade and Commerce the rate is 80 percent, and in the Finance
Ministry it is 73 percent.
   Top management at state enterprises continues to be appointed by
the party, through the government. The classic decision-making
triangle of management, party and trade union officials never has
been dissolved, although party spokesman Emil Kimmel said in an
interview that ``it has died a natural death.''
   The congress endorsed the right of the new Hungarian Socialist
Party to organize politically in the workplace, dismaying reformers
who associate such a presence with traditional Marxist-Leninist
infiltration and indoctrination.
   The overwhelming majority of Workers Militia members are also
party members, and its Marxist-Leninist orientation continues
informally.
   Plans to correct school text distortions could be complicated by
reluctance in the new party to face the past squarely. While
condemning Stalinist excesses, the party congress rejected calls by
reformist delegates to declare a holiday in memory of the 1956
anti-Stalinist revolution. It expressed support, instead, for a
``Day of Reconciliation,'' a normal working day with no direct
mention of the Soviet bloc's bloodiest revolt.
   The major newspapers, radio stations, and television remain
under direct or indirect party control.
   With the Hungarian Socialist Party committed, at least on paper,
to democracy and market forces, its founders assert that its
creation moves the country farther along the path of reform.
   But membership is open to anyone who signs a declaration of
agreement with the new party's democratic nature, leading to fears
that conservatives will join to keep jobs or privileges. If enough
do so, their sheer numbers could sabotage reforms.
   And even if the new party turns out to be a truly democratic
institution that honors its pledge to give up power if defeated at
the polls, the stubborn legacy of the old party is bound to color
society for years.

<HEAD>Czech Playwright Awarded Publishers' `Peace Prize'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German Publishers'
Association awarded Czech playwright Vaclav Havel its annual
``peace prize'' but the human rights activist was not allowed to
leave his country to claim it.
   Swiss actor and director Maximillian Schell collected the award
at a ceremony Sunday in St. Paul's cathedral because Prague
authorities refused to let the 53-year-old Havel to travel to
Frankfurt.
   Havel is banned from publishing in Czechoslovakia and has been
repeatedly jailed for his role in pressing for democratic reforms
in his Communist homeland. He is a co-founder of the Charter 77
human rights organization.
   The West German Publishers Association peace prize is awarded as
part of the annual Frankfurt Book Fair.
   The publishing group says Havel plans to use the $13,000 prize
money to start an independent publishing house for banned
Czechoslovak authors.
   Schell read a short acceptance message sent by Havel, who
decried the continued repressions in Czechoslovakia against writers
who speak out for change.
   Havel reminded the gathering of the risks involved for him and
other writers living ``in a country where one is still thrown in
jail for his words'' and where ``socialism has become a rubber
truncheon.''

   Hurricane Jerry swept ashore at Texas' Galveston Island on
Sunday, spawning tornadoes and heavy rains, and severe
thunderstorms battered parts of Michigan with high wind and large
hail.
   Hurricane warnings and tornado watches were posted over
southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas and people were urged
to move inland from low-lying areas to avoid high tides and heavy
rain.
   The hurricane blew down power lines and trees and tossed cars in
Galveston before weakening overland, but there were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   Tornadoes were reported on the island, in Webster between
Houston and Galveston and in Orange, where several homes and
businesses were damaged. There were no reports of injuries.
   Thunderstorms developed along and north of a warm front that
extended across central Lower Michigan. Two campers at Traverse
City State Park were injured when a tree fell on their trailer.
   A tornado touched down near Buckley, Mich., but no injuries were
reported said Sgt. Marty Dahlstrom of the Wexford County Sheriff's
Department. Numerous trees were knocked down, at least one roof was
ripped off and a mobile home was demolished, Dahlstrom said.
   Storms also produced wind gusts to 58 mph, blowing down some
trees, and produced hail the size of golf balls, the National
Weather Service said.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered along
the Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Showers were scattered from the Colorado Rockies to South
Dakota, with light rain and snow showers over Wyoming and
south-central Montana.
   During the early morning, dense fog was reported in eastern
Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and the Washington,
D.C., area.
   Roanoke, Va., posted a record high of 85 degrees.
   But in the Northeast, Portland, Maine, had a record low of 36,
and in the Northwest , Eugene, Ore., tied its record of 32.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 22 degrees at Allagash,
Maine.
   On Saturday, thunderstorms produced severe weather in New York
state, knocking out power to thousands of homes and killing at
least one person, a man whose mobile home was thrown several
hundred feet.
   A sky diver who was aloft over western New York when the storm
hit was blown upward 1,500 feet in three seconds, said Niagara
County Sheriff's Deputy Duane Jacobs.
   David Konstabel said he had to cut his main parachute away to
descend, then use his reserve chute to land, said sky-diving
instructor Henry Szczepanski.

   Angela Lansbury says it took her two decades to
become a leading lady, and then it was 20 years too soon.
   The star of CBS-TV's ``Murder, She Wrote'' says she spent about
20 years as a supporting player in movies before she hit it big as
``Mame'' on Broadway in 1966.
   ``People thought I was fat because I had this round face, and I
think it was the round face that defeated me as an actress,'' the
64-year-old actress said in an interview in this week's People.
   By the time she started in ``Mame,'' Lansbury was 40, ``and
40-year-old actresses didn't have a chance. Nowadays, most of the
women in Hollywood who are successful are in their 40s, so I just
missed.''

   Emmy-winning actress Candice Bergen, star of
TV's ``Murphy Brown,'' soon will have a Beverly Hills zip code
again, to go with her addresses in New York and France.
   Moving into the one-story, colonial-style residence _ even if it
is part-time while filming the CBS show _ would represent a
homecoming of sorts. Bergen, daughter of the late ventriloquist
Edgar Bergen, lived nearby as a child in a walled hacienda known as
Bella Vista.
   The seller of the new place, which has three bedrooms, maid's
quarters, four bathrooms and a pool, was asking $1.3 million, a
real estate broker unconnected with the deal told the Los Angeles
Times. The deal is in escrow.
   Bergen also has homes in France and New York with her husband,
French film director Louis Malle, and their 4-year-old daughter,

they are so much in love they want to adopt children.
   ``We want to adopt a son,'' the 51-year-old designer said in an

   ``After that we'll probably adopt another so he can have
company,'' added Kohle Yohannan, a 22-year-old Columbia University
student. ``I know it's difficult, but I plan to have a child within
two years. Mary and I want to go for every experience and live life
in its quintessential form.''
   The couple said they didn't make a formal prenuptial agreement.
   ``We had a verbal agreement that if either one of us gains 20
pounds that it would be cause for divorce,'' Yohannan said four
months into the marriage. ``So far we've both lost 10 pounds, so I
guess things are fine.''
   Yohannan already has begun to take an active role in the

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman named Shifa, attired in a modest
Moslem headscarf and a full-length dress, says she is ready to vote
in next month's general election _ the first in which Jordanian
women will take part.
   But who will determine her vote?
   ``Of course my husband, because he is the man,'' she told a
reporter who chatted with her on a busy Amman street festooned with
banners for the Nov. 8 parliamentary election.
   Women like Shifa _ she would not give her family name _ have
dampened the optimism of women's rights activists facing their
first nationwide campaign.
   ``Sixty percent of the women at least are not independent
voters. ... they will be influenced by their husband, father or
brother,'' said Laila Sharaf, one of just two female Cabinet
ministers in Jordan's 65-year history.
   Jordan gave women the right to vote in 1974, but nationwide
elections have not taken place since 1967. Women have voted only in
a few local elections to replace deputies who died or resigned.
   This year, several women are running for the 80 parliamentary
seats and women comprise about half the country's 1 million
registered voters.
   ``This is the first time we will have candidates discussing
women and their rights,'' said Mrs. Sharaf, a former minister of
information.
   Some male candidates have targeted appeals to female voters:
``Woman is half of society. She is the one who raises future
generations,'' announced a banner hoisted by one man.
   The election follows two decades of rapid educational
improvement.
   When Jordanians last voted nationwide, only about a quarter of
young women attended secondary school. Today the figure is about 80
percent, and many go on to universities or technical schools.
   But conservative views of women mainly as homemakers remain
deeply held _ some rooted in religion, some in local traditions.
   Many women wear headscarves and long plain dresses that
symbolize their adherence to a conservative vision of Islam.
   ``The world is the world of men, and they always believe the
woman is only for the house,'' said Haifa Bashir, head of the
Jordanian Federation of Women and a candidate for Parliament.
   Women accounted for less than 15 percent of the work force in
the mid-1980s, and activists say the number is declining because of
economic difficulties and the tendency to drop women workers before
men.
   ``Even now, when the family can't pay for all their children (to
study), they prefer to let the boy continue his studies and not the
girl,'' said Asma Khader, a leading human rights lawyers.
   ``They will not present the freedom to us,'' she added. ``We
must work for it.''
   Ms. Khader complained that Jordan's social security, insurance
and pension laws grant more benefits to men than women, and that
women cannot obtain a passport or get married without approval of
male relatives.
   Women married to foreign men cannot pass along Jordanian
citizenship to their children. And Khader said criminal laws allow
male relatives to kill a woman caught having sex out of wedlock.
   While many of the laws are based on interpretations of Islam,
Jordan's official religion, Mrs. Bashir argues that they are
misinterpretations.
   She said both the Koran, Islam's holy book, and traditional
Islamic law ``gave rights to women 14 centuries ago better than
what we are seeking now.''
   The debate flared into the press in September when a column
defending women's rights in the daily newspaper Al Rai prompted a
flood of complaints.
   One letter writer opined that women ``are short of brains based
on women's natural structure, which differs from the man's as her
emotional, psychological structure prevails.''
   ``The weight of a woman's brain is less than the brain of man,''
argued another letter writer.
   Apparently to counter such sentiments, King Hussein used a
recent speech to denounce religious preoccupation with women's
clothing or attempts to limit their freedom.
   ``Islam is the religion of action and production and cannot
accept the crippling of half the society,'' said the king, whose
wife Queen Noor is a Princeton-educated Arab-American.
   Women will have little impact on this year's election, said Mrs.
Sharaf, but ``there will be a time they begin and they learn. ...
By the time the next election is held, women will have increased
their political conciousness and their role.''
   Already, politics has become a part of women's lives.
   ``Everyone, everyone, everyone is talking about it,'' said
Rabiah Adawiyeh, who like Shifa wore Islamic clothing.
   ``There's nothing on their tongues except the elections.''

   Hurricane Jerry roared into the Texas
coast Sunday, killing at least two people as it tossed cars and
ripped down power lines, balconies and trees in this island city.
The storm also spun off tornadoes that inflicted damage along the
Gulf Coast.
   Jerry's fury combined with the highest tides of the year to
flood coastal areas as thousands of people, mostly in Louisiana,
fled to higher ground.
   The center of the hurricane moved ashore on the west end of
Galveston Island about 7:25 p.m., with sustained winds of 75 mph
and gusts up to 100 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables, Fla.
   In Galveston, a 32-mile long barrier island connected to the
mainland by a causeway, officials reported scattered power
failures, street flooding and a roof torn off a building, along
with numerous downed trees and neon signs.
   Late Sunday, the bodies of a man and a small child were found
floating near the city's seawall, said Gary Stone, a spokesman for
Galveston's Emergency Operations Center. He said the victims, who
could not be identified immediately, were believed to either
passengers in a car that washed over the seawall or pedestrians.
   There were no other immediate reports of injuries.
   Glass windows in an apartment complex on the island's west end
were blown out, and several balconies were torn off.
   ``The winds blew threw the glass of several of these apartments
and blew the gutters down,'' said John Harsh, a resident of the
complex who had been without power since 7:30 p.m. ``Whole
balconies came down, it just ripped them up from the bolts.''
   At the historic Galvez Hotel, the management said guests would
have to spend the night in the lobby because several rooms had
broken glass inside.
   Houston Lighting &amp; Power spokeswoman Graham Painter said 52,000
customers were without power Sunday night, most of them on
Galveston.
   The city of 62,000 was the site of one of the worst hurricanes
in U.S. history, a storm that killed an estimated 6,000 people in
1900. Galveston Island is about 50 miles south of Houston.
   By 11 p.m., Jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm as maximum
sustained winds decreased to 70 mph. The storm's center was located
about 40 miles north of Galveston near Baytown, Texas, or near
latitude 29.6 degrees north, longitude 94.6 west.
   The storm was moving northeast at 14 mph and was expected to
brush past the southeast side of Houston while steadily losing
power over land, meteorologists said. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5
inches were expected along the path during the next 12 to 24 hours.
   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severe
possible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated Charleston and other
parts of South Carolina last month, was a category 4.
   ``I think that we did very well,'' Galveston Mayor Jan
Coggeshall said after the hurricane had passed over the island
after a two-hour mauling.
   ``I think we're going to find some damage, but I don't think
it's going to be as significant as it could have been. I think we
are going to suffer a lot of erosion on the west end beaches,'' he
said.
   City leaders said a team of officials would begin surveying
damage to the area at 6 a.m. Monday.
   As Jerry struck, heavy rains and rising tides moved over the
upper Texas coast and were expected to increase over the southwest
Louisiana coast, the National Weather Service said.
   The hurricane center said the area would receive 4 to 8 inches
of rain.
   Jerry's hurricane-strength winds extended 25 miles east of the
eye and 15 miles west. That was about 10 times weaker than Hugo,
which packed hurricane force winds extending 100 miles out from its
center.
   ``It's a very small hurricane. I would not expect much damage
from it,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center.
   ``Category 4 is a major disaster and Jerry is a bad day,'' said
Jerry Jarrell, deputy director of the center.
   Jerry strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane 110
miles off Galveston Island at 1 p.m. when its sustained wind hit 75
mph, or 1 mph above the threshold, according to the National
Hurricane Center. During the afternoon, the storm reached 85 mph
sustained wind and swung onto a northerly course toward Galveston,
the hurricane center said.
   The storm surge caused by a combination of Jerry and high tides
was not expected to be over eight feet, he said. In comparison, the
storm surge in the Charleston, S.C., area from Hugo was up to 20
feet.
   Hurricane warnings were posted from Freeport, Texas, to
Intracoastal City, La. Tornado watches were issued for southwestern
Louisiana and southeastern Texas.
   Several tornadoes were spotted between Galveston and Houston,
damaging some buildings. No injuries were immediately reported.
   A tornado hit downtown Orange, near the Louisiana border, and
several homes and businesses were damaged, police officials said.
There were no reports of injuries, police dispatcher Rachel Timaeus
said.
   Earlier, a funnel cloud was reported near New Orleans.
   Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews, who ordered an 11 p.m.
curfew, said he believed many of the island city's residents
decided to stay in their homes behind the seawall. He said about
500 residents left their low-lying homes on the island's west end,
which is not protected by the seawall.
   Several cars were tossed onto sidewalks and there was a report
of one washing over the seawall, but officials did not know if
anyone was inside. The wind also blew out the windows of a police
car, but the officer was not injured.
   Earlier, workers distributed sandbags and barricades to
low-lying areas, and residents stocked up on supplies and secured
homes and boats.
   In Louisiana's southwestern corner, the Cameron Parish Civil
Defense Office ordered coastal areas evacuated, and spokesman Scott
Henry said that affected 8,000 to 10,000 people.
   ``We're anticipating extremely high tides, plus we'll be in the
storm push for the tidal surge,'' said Henry.
   Even without the hurricane, tides were expected to peak this
week because of the relative positions of the sun, moon and the
Earth.
   High tide at Galveston, which arrives around sunset and just
before sunrise, is 1{ to 2 feet above sea level. Astronomical tide
was expected to add about a foot, and storm surge 4 to 7 feet,
forecasters said.
   ``Our main concern is we only have two or three roads out of the
parish,'' said Henry of Cameron Parish. High tides ``could cut off
several escapes routes. As night comes, if you hadn't already got
out, it could cause problems.''
   An evacuation center was set up by the Red Cross at Lake
Charles-Boston High School, but only 48 people had checked in by
late Sunday.
   ``Cameron evacuates four times a year. I don't think they were
worried about this one,'' said Mary Touchette, the center's manager.
   Offshore oil operations pulled hundreds of workers in from the
Gulf of Mexico.
   Chevron spokesman Jim Lajaunie said Sunday the 250 offshore
workers from the company's base in Amelia, La., were moved to dry
land. Mobil Oil spokesman Bill Barnard said about 600 workers were
called in in southwestern Louisiana.

   Joel Brandon never could figure out how to
whistle the way most people do, but that didn't stop him from
winning top honors at the International Whistle-Off for the second
time.
   The Altadena, Calif., man whistles while inhaling, sucking air
between his teeth and tongue to produce a unique, horn-like sound.
   ``I never used it when I was young,'' the 40-year-old Brandon
said of his unusual style. ``It was so odd-looking, I got a lot of
flak.''
   Brandon won the solo popular male division with his renditions
of ``Wave'' and ``Green Dolphin Street,'' and captured the solo
classical male honors with a Bach concerto. He won in 1987, too.
   Another crowd-pleaser at Sunday's 12th-annual event was Judy
Roberts of Eugene, Ore., who whistled several songs while standing
on her head and conducting a puppet show with her feet.
   ``I think whistlers are made, not born,'' said Brandon, who has
performed with orchestras in Houston and Indianapolis. He had this
advice for would-be whistling champs: ``Practice. It's just like
anyone who plays an instrument.''
   He won $500 and a trip to anywhere in the United States.

   It may sound like a contradiction in terms, but
the vending machine business is trying to go upscale.
   For the yuppie in a rush, there are now machines that offer a
7-inch, microwave-heated pizza or a freshly-brewed cup of
cappuccino or espresso.
   These and other variations on the old coin-in-the-slot candy
machine were on display this weekend at the National Automatic
Merchandising Association's convention.
   The latest in coffee machines, made by Borghi SpA of Italy,
grind beans for each cup, blast hot water through the grounds, and
dispense a strong brew in a tiny cup.
   ``We're looking for the upscale, higher-end consumers who
appreciate a better, European cup of coffee and ethnic groups who
don't like American coffee,'' said Erick Feitshans, director of
U.S. operations.
   Pennsylvania businessman G.W. Black hopes college students
hankering for a late-night snack will line up at his Pizza Chef
machines, which heat an individual-size cheese and pepperoni pizza
in 60 seconds.
   The innovations aren't cheap. The pizzas go for $2 and the
Italian coffee machine demands 80 cents to $1.20 a cup.
   But the industry has an answer to the problem of finding enough
change, too: Vending machines that take magnetic-strip debit cards,
deducting the amount of purchase and spitting the cards back out
for re-use. The cards are sold in vending machines that accept big
bills.

   John Browne's new license plates say OIHO
instead of OHIO, but he isn't about to return them.
   ``I won't give them back even if they tell me to get new ones,''
Browne said. ``I think they might be valuable.''
   Browne, a 20-year-old printer at City Hall, got the plates
recently when he bought a new car. The state name was printed
across the bottom of the plates instead of the top, and the
lettering was reversed. The plates apparently were turned
upside-down between the time the state name was stamped on and the
time the number were added.
   ``I looked at it and laughed,'' he said.
   State officials offered to swap the plates, but don't object to
Brown's keeping them.

   Bosco Matamoros, once the voice of the Contra
rebels, is hammering out his memoirs, a work he says will unmask
the ``stupidity and arrogance'' of the government's handling of
Central American policy in Nicaragua.
   ``I will portray the Americans as we saw them,'' Matamoros said
during an interview at his Washington apartment. ``I'm very
relieved we don't have to deal with people who didn't speak a word
of Spanish, who represented the ugly American.''
   Matamoros, 44, always an outspoken critic of the United States,
describes himself as deeply resentful of what he sees as the Bush
administration's dismantling of the civilian directorate and the
way the Contras were treated. Although he still considers himself
the movement's spokesman, the United States does not.
   ``My whole thesis of the book is the whole thing has been a
farce,'' he said. ``The Americans never respected us as the
resistance. They saw us as puppets. Their attitude is `change your
course or you are purged.'''
   The United States backed the Contra rebels since 1981 in their
fight to oust the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. That
support brought international condemnation as well as domestic
problems, most notably the Iran-Contra affair in which the
government sold arms to Iran and used the funds to finance the
anti-Sandinista rebels.
   The Bush administration has sought to distance itself from the
Contras. Pointing to congressional will and agreements reached by
Central American leaders, the administration has stopped arguing
for military aid and agreed to provide the rebel combatants, most
of whom are in base camps in Honduras, with food and clothes.
   Several of the civilian leaders recently returned to Nicaragua
to take part in next year's elections. The CIA-financed Contra
office in Miami and the congressionally approved radio station were
shuttered.
   ``Our perspective has changed,'' said one administration source,
who works closely with Contra issues but declined to be further
identified. ``We no longer deal with the guys in suits.''
   The State Department now works directly with the rebel
commanders, he said, adding that the Contra civilians ``at the time
served a tactical necessity'' to lobby Congress for funds. The move
leaves Matamoros and others as unemployed exiles.
   Sitting by his typewriter near four cages of chirping doves,
finches and parakeets, Matamoros says: ``A tamed, more easily
influenced Sandinismo was preferable to continuing the fight in
Washington.''
   He leafs through his notes, written in Spanish and translated
into English by his American wife.
   ``They have achieved their big objective, to eliminate the
resistance politically,'' Matamoros says.
   He said his book, in the infant stages, will talk about his
dealings with prominent figures in the Iran-Contra scandal,
including Oliver North, Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, Richard R. Miller
and Richard Secord.
   North, Channell and Miller were found guilty of charges
surrounding the affair. Secord, a former air force general, is
scheduled for trial next month.
   Matamoros mocked the key American players charged with plotting
the Contra policy, saying: ``It shows the stupidity and arrogance
of an establishment facing a problem in a Third World country.''
   Matamoros indicated his book also will expose the schisms and
infighting among the civilian Contra leadership. He portrays
himself as sympathetic to the fighters, writing: ``on one side are
the Sandinistas, on the other are the refugee camps.''
   But Matamoros, who has lived outside Nicaragua since 1962, saw
the battlefield only when accompanying journalists on forays into
war zones. He headed Nicaragua's delegation to the United Nation's
Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome as the representative of
Anastasio Somoza, the Nicaraguan dictator deposed by the
Sandinistas in 1979.

<HEAD>Jesse Helms in a New Flurry of Conservative Activity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was Jesse Helms one recent night,
rolling one of his trademark legislative hand grenades down the
aisle of the United States Senate and waiting cannily to watch his
colleagues scatter in fear.
   But instead, freshman Sen. Barbara Mikulski handily defused the
Helms bombshell _ an amendment barring U.S. aid to Poland from
going to communist-controlled enterprises.
   Invoking her own Polish heritage, the Maryland Democrat asserted
that ``Poles everywhere ... know that the heart and soul of Poland
lie with democracy.'' She argued Helms' amendment would cripple a
fledgling economic reform movement and ``once again slam down the
iron curtain.'' The move was killed, 74-25.
   It was one in a series of recent legislative setbacks for the
vocally conservative Helms, whose maneuvers on the Senate floor are
drawing an irritated response from other senators.
   ``We are being asked to cast a lot of votes, make a lot of
political statements, not for the purpose of what the body was set
up to do but rather for a variety of other purposes,'' said Sen.
Tim Wirth, D-Colo. ``I, for one, am fed up with it.''
   In the past few weeks alone, Helms sought to bar the National
Endowment for the Arts from subsidizing works deemed ``indecent'';
to pressure the Bush administration to use military force to oust
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega; and to kill reparations
payments to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.
   Veteran Helms observers say the flurry of activity is an
indication that at age 68, the North Carolina Republican still has
the zeal for a fourth term in Washington and will go after it with
his usual ferocity. Helms has made no public announcement of his
intentions for next year, when his seat comes up for re-election.
   Says political scientist Merle Black: ``His political strength
has always been ... the old Confederate mentality _ you don't have
to win, you just have to put up a good stand.''
   Helms acknowledged he has been active lately, but called it
coincidental and dismissed any political connection. ``Every six
years this sort of speculation occurs,'' he said.
   And he said despite polls showing his favorable rating below 50
percent, his own instincts tell him his brand of emotional issues
politics still plays well in North Carolina. ``Joe Lunchbucket, out
there in America land, he goes by issues ... If anything, there has
been an increase in the intensity of people with respect to issues
which they think are important to them.''
   The Senate ultimately agreed to a watered-down version of his
arts amendment, but defeated him on the reparations issue and
soundly knocked down the Panama proposal.
   ``The Senate is refusing to be intimidated,'' said Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J. ``At some point you've got to ask yourself, why is
he doing this?''
   One answer may be fundraising.
   Helms' office has sent out a flurry of money appeals, and the
fight over grants supporting ``offensive'' art has been turned into
radio commercials in North Carolina that tout the senator as a
defender of moral standards.
   Another may be politics.
   During debate over arts funding, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
voiced what other senators were saying privately: ``If you vote
against this amendment, can you not see the 30-second ad? `Senator
So-and-so voted for pornography ...'''
   But some say Helms' tactics are losing their effectiveness and
predict he will find himself with less and less company.
   ``I think he is running scared,'' said Black, a political
science professor at Emory University in Atlanta who has closely
studied Helms' career. He said the senator's recent high activity
level is ``a signal that the re-election campaign is underway, and
that he has slipped.''
   And the outrage was palpable one recent night as the clock
ticked later and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell sought
agreement to have the Senate meet at 8:30 the next morning to
resume work on Helms' amendment.
   ``My 17-month-old granddaughter is visiting me and I want to
feed her breakfast,'' Helms said. ``Could we start at 9?''

<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates and others say they're glad
President Bush is finally filling a vacancy that will put the
Consumer Product Safety Commission back in business _ but they're
troubled with his choice for the job.
   Bush last week nominated Jacqueline Jones-Smith as the panel's
third commissioner. If confirmed by the Senate, she would succeed
Terrence M. Scanlon to head the commission and would provide the
quorum the panel needs to conduct business.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' said Mary Ellen Fise, product
safetyrector at the Consumer Federation of America, thgest consumer
advocacy group. ``We're happy that finally the commission will be
able to act again.''
   ``There was concern for the overall commission in the fact that
it can't function now. They can't take formal action,'' said one
congressional aide.
   The agency has been virtually powerless without its
congressionally mandated quorum of three since Scanlon's departure
nine months ago. It cannot hold meetings to proceed with rulemaking
or many enforcement activities.
   Earlier, consumer advocates attacked Scanlon's emphasis on
voluntary ety standards and cooperation with industry. Theny
criticized Bush for allowing the commission to languish without its
third member.
   But now, some expresss about whether Jones-Smith has the
necessary bexperience in the consumer arena.
   Jones-Smien a staff attorney in the general counsel's ofl
Election Commission since 1987. She also was an assistant county
attorney in Montgomery County, Md.
   ``Whdn't find was any evidence of experience in consumer product
safety issues,'' said Pam Gilbert, consumer program director of the
Public Interest Research Group, founded by consumer advocate Ralph
Nader.
   ``That's where I would register my concern. She would be the
chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission with little or
no experience in product safety issues,'' Gilbert said.
   However, Bonnie Guiton, head of the White House office of
consumer affairs, said, ``There is value to someone who hasn't been
so locked in that they can't see things with a balanced
perspective.''
   ``Jackie is very bright, very capable and her legal background
makes her very thorough,'' said Guiton, a friend of Jones-Smith.
   There also has been concern on Capitol Hill about her ``lack of
formal background in consumer matters,'' according to one House
Commerce committee staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, most in consumer interests circles say they believe
Jones-Smith will be confirmed by the Senate.

<HEAD>Says He Almost Dropped Acting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor William Hurt says the ordeal of being
center stage in a highly publicized court case pushed him to the
brink of abandoning his acting career.
   ``I've been walking the edge for a long time, thinking about
whether acting is the right thing for me to be doing,'' Hurt said
in an interview in Sunday's editions of The New York Times. ``I
have never said that because I was an actor you can have my
privacy, you can steal my soul. You can't.''
   The Oscar-winner drew headlines this summer and fall in the
lawsuit filed in New York state court by the mother of his
6-year-old son.
   Sandra Jennings claimed she was Hurt's common-law wife and
deserved a portion of the millions Hurt has earned during the past
eight years. A judge ruled in Hurt's favor two weeks ago, but
Jennings is appealing the verdict.
   To gather his thoughts, Hurt has returned to the stage at the
Circle Repertory Company, where he was a performing member from
1977 to 1982.
   Hurt stars opposite Lois Smith in ``Beside Herself,'' a play by
Joe Pintauro about a middle-age woman who confronts the ghosts of
her younger self.
   ``This is the best thing I could be doing right now,'' he said.
``I can relax the most. My guard doesn't have to be up.''
   Hurt has starred in the films, ``The Big Chill,'' ``Body Heat,''
and ``Broadcast News,'' and won an Academy Award for ``The Kiss of
the Spider Woman.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Shows Disorganized Strategy on Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil and auto company lobbyists had worked
furiously to weaken President Bush's plan to produce millions of
clean-fuel cars _ and it was time for a crucial subcommittee vote
on gutting the program.
   Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., the bill's chief sponsor, told the
packed hearing room that White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
told him the administration did not oppose the weakening amendment.
   But Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., piped up that he just got a
call from Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K.
Reilly, saying the administration vigorously opposed the change.
   The mixup exposed a disorganized administration seemingly in
conflict with itself over President Bush's clean air bill. The
weakening amendment passed the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee on Wednesday, 12-10.
   ``I don't know where the administration is and it may be all
over the lot ... on both sides,'' said Waxman, the subcommittee
chairman, shortly before the vote. ``It tells a lot about how
they're handling the bill.''
   Actually, the administration did have a workable strategy _ to
oppose the industry amendment but show a willingness to negotiate
changes to restore the thrust of Bush's proposal.
   But the strategy broke apart the day of last week's vote.
   The administration only had to turn one GOP vote around, but the
mixed signals were ``the blessing from the Pope that Republicans
needed'' to vote with the special interests, according to a
Democratic staffer, speaking only on condition he not be named.
   The incident was just the latest example of administration
officials sowing confusion about their position on a key issue.
   When the Senate was debating repeal of catastrophic health
coverage for retirees, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan publicly endorsed an amendment that would have salvaged
most of the program. Within hours, White House Budget Director
Richard G. Darman said Sullivan was not speaking for the
administration, which was not endorsing any particular amendment.
   In the failed coup against Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the administration's actions _ reported as confused and
cautious _ failed to match Bush's rhetoric encouraging dissident
officers to overthrow the strongman.
   The clean air vote ``could have been avoided by sending a clear
message that the administration was opposed'' to the weakening
language, the Democratic staffer said.
   At stake was a provision that the White House previously
characterized as ``the most innovative and far-reaching'' component
of Bush's proposals to clear up urban smog by the end of the
century.
   In fact, according to lawmakers and administration officials,
negotiations to change the amendment were underway as the
subcommittee convened last Wednesday. But instead of communicating
that, Lent and Waxman told of the conflicting phone calls.
   Amid such confusion, eight Republicans and four Democrats backed
the weakening changes, while nine Democrats and one Republican
opposed them.
   The vote weakened Bush's proposed performance standard for fuels
other than pure gasoline, and dropped the required production of 1
million clean-fuel cars a year between 1997 and 2004. The change
would allow automakers to simply certify that they could build the
cars.
   The administration is negotiating with amendment sponsors Jack
Fields, R-Texas and Ralph Hall, D-Texas, to revive the key portions
of Bush's proposal in the full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   White House press spokesman Stephen Hart said Sununu did not
change the administration's position that the amendment should move
closer to the president's language. Any misunderstanding rested
with Lent, he added.
   Lent said in an interview that ``undoubtedly there was a
misunderstanding,'' about Sununu's position _ and acknowledged he
may not have given the subcommittee the full picture by failing to
mention the changes demanded by the administration.

   As UNESCO opens a monthlong meeting to chart its
future course, the United States is expressing doubt that the
troubled world body will jettison enough ideology to bring about
Washington's return as a member.
   The 158-nation organization will also decide whether to admit
the PLO as a full member, a step the United States has said will
rule out any possibility of it rejoining the agency.
   The meeting, beginning Tuesday, represents a crucial test for
Director-General Federico Mayor. The Spanish biochemist and former
education minister took over as head of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization two years ago.
   He must see that the new, more pragmatic program he has proposed
for the first half of the 1990s gets approved without any of the
ideological overtones that led to U.S. and British withdrawal in
the mid-1980s.
   A former U.S. senator heading an international panel examining
UNESCO policies backed Mayor's plan.
   Republican Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, speaking for the
Americans on the panel, said Thursday that if UNESCO adopts ``the
substance'' of Mayor's plan, ``the United States should resume its
membership in UNESCO early in 1990.''
   But the panel, in a report released today, said UNESCO will
remain an ``underperformer'' unless it adopts reforms and seeks
advice from eminent scientists and experts in human rights,
communications and other fields.
   ``The key to UNESCO's success is professionalization'' in its
programs, says the report commissioned by the U.N. Association of
the U.S.A., a private group interested in strengthening and
improving the United Nations and other international agencies.
   Panelists were drawn from America, the Soviet Union and numerous
other industrialized and developing countries and spanned the
ideological spectrum.
   The United States and Britain, which between them provided 30
percent of UNESCO's budget, pulled out because they said UNESCO had
become too political, spent too much money and was poorly managed.
   Singapore also left, saying it could spend its dues better
elsewhere.
   Some 2,000 delegates will attend the biennial meeting of the
General Conference, the organization's highest decision-making
body. In addition to charting UNESCO's future activities, they will
adopt a budget for 1990-1991.
   The United States and Britain have said they will review their
positions on rejoining UNESCO after the General Conference ends.
   Last month, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John R. Bolton
told a congressional committee that it was ``extremely unlikely''
the United States would rejoin the body if its current draft plan
for 1990-1995 is approved.
   Bolton said Mayor, who took over in November 1987 from Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, had promised to depoliticize the world
body, introduce budgetary restraints, cut back on activities and
``neutralize'' a drive by Third World nations to set up a new world
information order.
   Bolton said Mayor failed on all counts and has been ``hesitant
to enunciate a clear, new direction, much less institute
significant change or programmatic reforms.''
   Mayor has said his room for maneuver was somewhat limited
because he had inherited M'Bow's programs. He said more reform
would come after the General Conference adopted his proposals.
   But he asserts that since he took over UNESCO has become more
open, improved its management and strengthened its ties with member
states and other U.N. agencies. He promised to make personnel
changes but said he would not remove senior aides appointed by
M'Bow.
   On the Palestine Liberation Organization's request for
membership, he has said the U.N. General Assembly should decide
such issues, not UNESCO. But he has promised to involve the
Palestine observer mission more closely in UNESCO activities.
   UNESCO's executive board recommended Wednesday that the PLO
request be put off until 1991.
   As at previous conferences for more than a decade, one of the
most contentious issues will be the New World Information and
Communication Order.
   Mayor presented a new reform-oriented free press approach in the
communications section of the plan for 1990-1995. But members of
UNESCO's 50-nation executive board, including Senegal's Iba Der
Thiam, made changes steering the plan toward disputed objectives.
   The delegates will have to decide whether to accept the board's
changes or stick with the draft proposed by Mayor.
   To overcome what they see as Western domination in the flow of
information, Third World nations, backed by the Soviet bloc, favor
the new information order so they can regulate content of news and
enlist media support for government objectives.
   Western nations and news organizations say the order could lead
to censorship and other restrictions on journalists.

<HEAD>Hurricane Hugo Harmed Endangered Birds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo took a devastating human toll,
but its victims also included rare and endangered birds such as the
Red Cockaded Woodpecker, which lost one of its few remaining
habitats in the killer storm.
   ``Some endangered species really took a heavy hit by Hugo,''
said Rudy Rosen, a biologist for the National Wildlife Federation,
which along with several government agencies has been trying to
catalog the loss.
   Perhaps no endangered bird fared as badly as the Red Cockaded
Woodpecker, a tiny bird that conservationists have been trying to
save from extinction for nearly two decades. In recent years its
decline had been halted with an estimated 2,000 woodpecker colonies
found mainly in three national forests.
   One sanctuary for about 500 woodpecker colonies was the
250,000-acre Frances Marrion National Forest just north of
Charleston, S.C., where Hugo roared ashore last month.
   ``The forest was just wiped out. Trees on the ground, twisted
and uprooted,'' said Rosen. He said anywhere from one-fourth to
perhaps as many as three-fourths of the endangered woodpeckers in
the forest may have been killed. Those that lived through the storm
may not survive because most of the aging trees that were their
habitat no longer stand, he continued.
   ``We have lost potentially forever one of the most viable
populations of the Red Cockaded Woodpecker at a time when the
population is declining,'' said Rosen. The only other significant
habitats for the woodpeckers are national forests in Mississippi
and Florida.
   The old-growth pine trees at the Marrion forest, which the
woodpeckers called home, were especially easy targets for Hugo
because many already had been weakened by the woodpecker's boring
of holes for nests.
   The U.S. Forest Service has been drilling artificial cavities
into remaining pine trees in hopes of accommodating the surviving
woodpeckers, but Rosen said it's unclear whether that will work
because the remaining trees are not ideal for woodpeckers' nesting.
He said other animals and birds, including squirrels and owls, may
compete for the man-made nests.
   But the Red Cockaded Woodpecker was not the only endangered bird
caught by Hugo.
   Even before Hugo raced onto the U.S. mainland, its victims in
the Caribbean included the rare Puerto Rican wild parrot. Before
the storm, 47 of the endangered wild parrots were known to live in
the wild on the island.
   ``To date we have been able to locate 23 of the birds,'' said
Rosen. He said about 80 percent of the bird's habitat was
defoliated when Hugo whipped across the island.
   Conservationists for a time thought the storm also had claimed
five rare red wolves on Bull Island near Charleston. The wolves
disappeared for days but later were found, said Rosen.
   Their loss would have been a major setback in efforts by the
Interior Department to reintroduce red wolves into the wild. Until
a few years ago the red wolf was considered extinct except for
those found in zoos.
   Today there are fewer than two dozen of the wolves believed to
be in the wild, says Bob Irvin of the Wildlife Federation.

<HEAD>HUD Scandals, Management Reviews Question Reagan's Privatization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, partly because of the
federal housing scandal, appears to be quietly moving away from the
Reagan-era policy of turning more and more governmental functions
over to private enterprise.
   Publicly the administration remains committed to the policy of
``privatization,'' and the sale of some government assets remains
an attractive means to help reduce the budget deficit. But there
are a number of signs that the Bush administration does not share
its predecessor's zeal for finding ways to contract out work done
by government employees.
   After nine months in office, Budget Director Richard Darman has
not yet replaced previous officials who ran President Reagan's
privatization program.
   ``Let's not ignore the proper role of government in determining
those instances where the public benefit outweighs the costs,''
Darman's deputy, Frank Hodsoll, earlier this year told the
Privatization Council, a lobbying group formed in the Reagan years.
   ``We must draw the line between public responsibility and
private provision of goods and services,'' Hodsoll said.
   Conservatives estimate that privatization could save the
taxpayers billions of dollars, but a leading congressional watchdog
of Reagan's efforts, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said government
accountability should come before possible savings.
   ``Contractors, not government officials, often have effective
responsibility for the most basic decision-making,'' Pryor said.
   Darman recently told Congress ``the management problems of the
federal government are enormous.'' That assessment was based
largely on a government-wide review he ordered after reports
surfaced of widespread fraud and mismanagement at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development expected to cost the government $6
billion.
   Several officials who responded to the review questioned the
effectiveness of contracting out certain services and said civil
service morale needed a boost.
   ``Management and internal control oversight are inherently
governmental functions which are adversely affected by initiatives
like the current strong OMB (Office of Management and Budget)
emphasis on contracting out,'' NASA Deputy Administrator James R.
Thompson Jr. said in his memo to Darman.
   ``Nearly 90 percent of our funds pass through deliverers whose
operations and accounting systems are not under DOL operational
control,'' Labor Department Deputy Secretary Rod DeArment wrote to
Darman.
   Those who helped Reagan push his privatization plan contend
neither Bush nor Darman was committed to the idea and now can use
the HUD scl as a reason to halt the effort.
   ``It's norivatization that went wrong, it was the execution,''
said the ritage Foundation's Stephen Moore, who was resefor
Reagan's Commission on Privatization. ``Pri is being made a
scapegoat here.''
   Moore's ts mirror those of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who ushing
ahead with some of the more controversial elements of the Reagan
privatization plan: allowing tenants to public housing and
providing rent vouchers to instead of subsidies to their landlords.
   `t the idea, it was the implementation of the ide Kemp said when
asked if the $1 billion losses a HUD co-insurance program stemmed
from privatiin that case giving private lenders the power tove
government-insured loans.
   Under Reagan,rivatization was established within the budget
office and aidesere told to search for government assets and seo be
turned over to the private sector. As a rember of government
agencies now contract out secial and food service work, computer
processing and repairs and other work.
   HUD allows private lenders to process and approve government
loans; the Environmental Protection Agency hires consultants to
interpret regulations and the Energy Department contracts out
management of its nuclear facilities.
   Reagan's OMB in late 1987 estimated the government had saved
more than $2 billion through privatization and that several billion
more could be saved annually if more government work was contracted
out.
   Heritage, a conservative think tank, estimated $3 billion a year
could be saved by expanded privatization and a commission Reagan
appointed put the annual savings at $4.6 billion if work now
performed by 400,000 federal workers was contracted out.

<HEAD>Record Christmas Tree Season Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks like another record season for
Christmas tree farmers, despite the preference of many Americans
for artificial trees that can be boxed and stored until next year.
   A record 34.3 million Christmas trees were sold in 1988, and an
Agriculture Department report says the market is expected to exceed
35 million this year.
   Economist Doyle Johnson said there are about 15,000 commercial
Christmas tree growers in the United States. These producers have
more than 87 million trees of all ages planted on about 1 million
acres.
   Last year, he said, Christmas trees had a wholesale value of
about $680 million, putting the tree business ahead of a number of
traditional agricultural commodities in terms of total cash
receipts.
   In 1987, for example, oat production was worth about $200
million; rice, $500 million; sheep and lambs, $600 million; barley,
$800 million; sugar cane, $800 million; grain sorghum, $1 billion;
and peanuts, $1 billion.
   The report, which is scheduled for the November issue of
Farmline magazine, said that 90 percent of the Christmas trees sold
each year are U.S.-grown, with the rest coming from Canada.
   Top producing states are Oregon, Michigan, Wisconsin,
California, North Carolina, Washington and Pennsylvania.
   ``A few larger growers in the West and the Northeast harvest
over 1 million trees each, but most operations are much smaller,''
the report said. ``Many producers grow Christmas trees on a
part-time basis or to supplement other farm-related activities.''
   According to USDA and industry analysts, the supply of natural
Christmas trees may grow over the next five to seven years because
of overplanting following 1988 drought losses and the entry of new
growers.
   Johnson said growers averaged about $12 per tree last year,
while wholesale prices averaged about $20. Most trees _ Douglas fir
and Scotch pine _ retailed for $3 to $3.50 per foot.
   ``Consumers generally buy trees that are 6 to 7 feet tall,'' the
report said. ``Spruce trees, the most expensive type, retail for
$40 to $50. Pines are typically lower in price, especially in the
South. Naturally, a premium tree commands a premium price, but
usually requires longer to mature, and more labor.''
   Two other agency economists, Glenn Zepp and Boyd Buxton, said in
telephone interviews that they didn't know of any overriding factor
that would boost Christmas tree prices significantly this season
from 1988 levels.
   Fred Strathmeyer of Dover, Pa., president of the National
Christmas Tree Association, said Christmas tree farming demands
someone ``willing to work year-round on a crop that might not be
marketable for a good six years.''
   Depending on the species, it can take up to 15 years to grow a
tree to a height of six feet, the average retail height. The
average growth time is seven years; the shortest is four years in
the deep South.
   According to the association, there is a growing tendency for
farmers to open their land to people who want to choose and cut
their own trees. Currently, there are an estimated 5,000 of these
choose-and-cut farms.
   The trade association, which has been promoting Christmas trees
for more than 30 years, says the industry has grown 2 percent to
2.5 percent annually for the last 15 years, at least twice the
growth rate of the U.S. population.
   But the industry had its greatest blow in the 1950s when the
artificial tree was introduced, the report said. Made primarily in
South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the artificial tree continues
biting at the U.S. market.
   The industry countered in 1988 with its first national
advertising campaign, RealTree, featuring television personality
Willard Scott.
   ``Following a $1 million advertising assault on `fake' Christmas
trees, preliminary retail reports were encouraging,'' the report
said. ``Retailers' sales were up 6 percent over 1987.''
   The choose-and-cut farms showed the biggest gains, with an
average increase in sales of between 12 percent and 15 percent, the
report said.
   But the future is unclear. An increase in the number of family
households of 16 million between 1970 and 1980 would indicate a
growth market for real trees. However, a slow population growth of
1 percent a year, coupled with an aging America, could mean more
demand for artificial trees.
   ``The older generation, middle-aged America, tends to buy
artificial trees or forego a tree altogether,'' the report said.
``The family unit consisting of mom, dad and about two kids is the
backbone of the real Christmas tree market.''
   Strathmeyer said that in 1965 artificial trees held 20 percent
of the available market for Christmas trees. By 1985, artificials
held 47 percent and could add another 10 percent to 12 percent by
the mid-1990s.

   The Solar Maximum satellite,
repaired in a daring space shuttle mission five years ago, is
expected to come crashing back to Earth next month, possibly in
three big chunks.
   The satellite's imminent demise comes as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is trying to reassure the
public about the safety of a nuclear-powered probe to be launched
Tuesday from the space shuttle Atlantis.
   Charles Redmond, spokesman for NASA's science office, said the
chances of satellite debris hurting anyone are remote because Solar
Max's track takes it over large expanses of ocean and sparsely
settled land areas.
   ``This is a routine satellite re-entry,'' Redmond said Sunday.
Only the largest parts of the satellite are expected to survive the
heat created by crashing through the atmosphere: a gyroscope
package that orients the satellite, a frame for a sun sensor, and a
device that holds parts in place.
   Redmond said the satellite will hit the Earth sometime in
mid-November, producing up to three 120-pound pieces.
   Environmental activists oppose Tuesday's shuttle launch, saying
an accident might release radioactive fuel over parts of Florida.
   The Galileo probe, carrying 49.4 pounds of plutonium-238, is to
be released by the five astronauts six hours after launch and sent
on its six-year journey to Jupiter.
   The only portions of the United States under the Solar Max
ground track are South Florida, the extreme southern part of Texas
and Hawaii. The track also covers much of South America, Africa,
India, Australia and the southernmost tip of China.
   Solar Max cost $77 million to build and launch in February 1980,
at a time of maximum activity in the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.
Its mission was to study solar flares.
   But after 10 months of service, three fuses blew in a control
box and it was unable to point itself accurately. That, in turn,
caused four of its seven onboard instruments to fail.
   In 1984, the shuttle Challenger pulled alongside the satellite
and astronaut Terry Hart grabbed it with the ship's 50-foot robot
arm. At the time, it was called ``the historic first capture of a
satellite in orbit for in-flight repair'' and then-President Reagan
congratulated the astronauts in an Oval Office-to-Challenger call.
   The following day, two astronauts, working in the open cargo
bay, replaced the satellite's control system module and an
electronics box.
   Solar Max has been working well since then. Plans were made for
a time to boost it to a higher orbit again, but that would have set
back other scheduled missions, and the idea was abandoned, Redmond
said.
   ``It's seen a complete solar cycle,'' he said of the satellite.
``Essentially, it's completed its mission.''

   The historic Battery has been spruced
up, the tourists have been invited back, and all but one of the
emergency shelters for victims of Hurricane Hugo have been closed.
   But the recovery of this 319-year-old city has largely bypassed
the poor, and many families left homeless by the storm 3{ weeks ago
wonder where they will get their next meal and how long they can
depend on charity for a place to sleep.
   ``We've been going from place to place. This is the fourth place
we've stayed,'' said Ethel Williams, 77, bedridden with a cold last
week at the Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church shelter.
   Mrs. Williams hasn't been able to return to Ansonborough Homes,
a low-income housing project, since it was flooded with 4 feet of
water by the 18-foot tidal surge that came ashore with Hugo on
Sept. 21.
   Joining Mrs. Williams in her worries was her 78-year-old
neighbor, Rosa Ferguson, who retired on a small pension.
   ``I don't know where I'm going to live,'' Mrs. Ferguson said.
``The only thing I wish for is they could turn me out to a shelter
of my own, that I could find my own shack.''
   The two women are far from alone.
   The church is feeding about 150 people a day and housing 16,
with more expected, said the Rev. Charles McLamore.
   ``We're talking about the people who've got no family to go to,
got no insurance to repair their home,'' he said. ``Those kind of
people that lost everything they had, and a paycheck won't cover
it.''
   Hugo killed 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.
mainland.
   In South Carolina, 18 were killed, 270,000 left jobless and
50,000 to 65,000 lost homes. Damage to homes, businesses and the
farming, fishing, timber and tourism industries has been estimated
at $4 billion or more.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency provides individuals and
families with up to $10,000 for housing and smaller amounts for
repairs and rent. So far, the agency has distributed about $4.4
million to 2,300 people.
   But McLamore says many of the poor will never see the federal
aid because they're unable or unwilling to deal with the paperwork.
   ``Most of these people who need it, most don't want to go
through all of them applications and stuff,'' he said. ``A lot of
these people can't write, can't read, just can't find a decent job.
... They (are) just left out.''
   The American Red Cross has helped thousands by providing
vouchers for food, clothing and furniture, and one month's rent for
temporary housing, said Liz Leopard, a spokeswoman for the Carolina
Lowcountry Red Cross. But she said the poor may be unable to bounce
back as quickly as middle- and upper-class victims.
   ``(It's) the people who are barely getting by in the first place
that really get hit by this,'' she said.
   The Red Cross, which housed 90,000 people in 67 shelters in five
states at one point, had just one shelter open in South Carolina
during the weekend, housing 40 people.
   In the Battery section overlooking Fort Sumter, roofs of stately
homes have been patched and debris has been cleared and stacked for
removal. Mayor Joseph Riley has invited the tourists to return.
   Relief workers say there are many like LeRoy Clifford, who lost
everything in the storm and is living at the church shelter with
his blind father. Housing prospects are bleak.
   ``Really, I don't know,'' Clifford said when asked where he and
his father will live.
   Roxy Hyatt lost her job just before the hurricane. Then, Hugo
tossed a tree onto her trailer in North Charleston.
   ``We've had to hit the free food lines,'' said Ms. Hyatt, who
has two children, Shawna, 10, and Corey, 6. She's looking for a job
but having a hard time for lack of money for gas, and the handouts
go only so far: ``Enough to survive, but it's barely enough.''
   She and her children got sick from trudging to relief centers in
the unseasonably cold and heavy rains that followed the storm.
   ``Shawna and Corey both have strep throat, and Corey has a rash
that doctors say is from the stress of the storm,'' she said.
``I've been begging and borrowing to get the money for the medicine
... but it still wasn't enough.''

   Father-and-son actors Martin Sheen and Emilio
Estevez pounded the pavement to help the city's homeless find
shelter.
   The two celebrities were joined by more than 100 recovering drug
addicts from Skid Row in Saturday's third-annual Run for the
Homeless in Griffith Park.
   ``I'm so proud of myself because I thought about quitting or
cheating by tripping somebody near me during the race,'' said Betty
Wright, 25, who finished next to last among the group of Skid Row
runners. ``But I figured if I could do this honestly, I can do
anything.''
   More than 1,000 participated in the 5-kilometer run, raising
more than $100,000, sponsors said. The event benefited Chrysalis, a
non-profit organization that finds jobs and shelter for the
homeless.
   Roni Apple, 32, who lives in a Salvation Army treatment center
on Skid Row, said the race ``showed me _ amazingly enough _ that I
still have my health'' after years of drug abuse.
   ``Bad luck and timing have put many families out in the cold,''
Sheen said in a statement issued before the run. ``This is one way
to get these homeless people back in the running.''

<HEAD>Sisulu Ranks With Mandela Among Prominent Black Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South African blacks view Nelson
Mandela and Walter Sisulu as virtual equals, and the Sisulu clan is
widely considered the first family of the anti-apartheid movement.
   But during their long imprisonment, Mandela, a college-educated
lawyer and charismatic speaker, captured the international
spotlight rather than Sisulu, a former laborer and high school
dropout.
   ``I am happy to be with the people and to receive a civilized
welcome,'' Sisulu told hundreds of supporters and journalists
gathered outside his small stucco house in Soweto after his release
from 26 years in prison Sunday.
   Despite his unpromising origins, Sisulu has become one of the
most respected thinkers and strategists of the outlawed African
National Congress. His wife and six children are committed and
respected activists in the anti-apartheid movement.
   Wearing glasses and a gray suit, the white-haired, 77-year-old
Sisulu looked more like a church elder than leader of an outlawed
guerrilla group.
   But he remains completely dedicated to his organization, which
was formed in 1912, the year he was born in the Xhosa homeland of
Transkei, also Mandela's birthplace.
   Unlike Mandela, who is related to a tribal chief and was trained
for leadership, Sisulu was born into rural poverty and quit school
at 15 to help support his family.
   He held jobs as a baker's assistant, domestic servant, dairy
worker, factory laborer and gold miner. After quarreling with
employers over wages and work conditions, he set up his own real
estate business, which lasted only a few years.
   Sisulu joined the then-legal ANC in Johannesburg in 1940, and
became known as the person young men from the rural areas should
see to get a start in the big city. He advised and helped Mandela
and current ANC President Oliver Tambo, who are both six years
younger.
   Sisulu was secretary-general of the ANC and ran its day-to-day
operations from 1949 to 1954, when the government ordered him to
resign. After that, he continued to participate behind the scenes.
   He was imprisoned eight times from 1953 to 1964 and was one of
156 defendants in the 1956 to 1961 treason trial of government
opponents, which ended with acquittals for all.
   In 1962, Sisulu was arrested six times, but charged only once.
He was convicted in March 1963 of furthering the aims of the ANC,
which had been banned in 1960.
   Released on appeal, Sisulu went underground and joined the ANC's
armed wing. In July 1963 he was arrested with others at the ANC's
secret headquarters in Rivonia, outside Johannesburg, and charged
with sabotage.
   During the trial, Sisulu acknowledged the ANC had used sabotage
but denied the state's charge that a guerrilla war had been
launched because, he said, ``There was still hope.''
   ``Leading Afrikaner intellectuals began to meet leaders of the
African people,'' he said. ``It was my view that well-conducted
political action could bring about a changed situation.''
   Sisulu's wife, Albertina, is a prominent activist in her own
right. She was banned from 1964 until 1981, and was served with new
restrictions in 1988 because of her role as co-president of the
banned United Democratic Front, an anti-apartheid coalition. Her
restrictions were lifted on Friday.
   The government granted her a limited passport in June, allowing
her to leave the country for the first time. She met President Bush
and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, among other world
leaders.
   The couple's oldest son and daughter, Max and Lindiwe, live in
exile. Their third child, Zwelakhe, editor of the New Nation, was
freed in 1988 after being detained without charge for two years. He
is prohibited from working as a journalist.
   The Sisulus' adopted son, Jonguzi, was sentenced to five years
on Robben Island for treason. Another son, Mlungisi, runs a small
business in Soweto. The youngest daughter, Nonkululekhe, attends
the University of the Western Cape.

<HEAD>10 Governors Plea to Supreme Court Wins Pro-Choice Applause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten governors, in an unusual
friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court are urging
the justices to reject efforts to restrict abortion.
   The governors asked the high court to strike down an Illinois
statute they said would impose ``extremely burdensome
requirements'' on abortion clinics.
   They added that while it is their job to enforce constitutional
rights, it is up to the courts to define those rights.
   They urged the high court not to scale back the principle laid
down in the landmark 1973 case, Roe v. Wade, holding that women
have a constitutional right to abortions during the first three
months of pregnancy.
   The amicus curiae brief in the Illinois case, Turnock v.
Ragsdale, was signed by Govs. Madeline Kunin of Vermont, James
Blanchard of Michigan, Richard Celeste of Ohio, Steve Cowper of
Alaska, Mario Cuomo of New York, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
Booth Gardner of Washington, Neil Goldschmidt of Oregon, John
McKernan of Maine and Roy Romer of Colorado.
   McKernan is a Republican; the other nine are Democrats.
   Kunin told reporters after addressing the closing session of the
20th annual conference of the National Abortion Rights Action
League on Sunday, ``The climate has dramatically changed in the
past two weeks.''
   She cited the failure of abortion restrictions during a special
session of the Florida legislature last week, and the House vote to
expand Medicaid eligibility for abortions to victims of rape and
incest.
   President Bush said Friday he is looking to see if there is
``room for flexibility'' to avoid a veto on the Medicaid abortion
funding.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, speaking Sunday
on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' said a veto ``would be a tragic
mistake on his part. We're talking here about the poorest, most
vulnerable American women, those who have become pregnant after
being victims of rape or incest, and can't afford to pay for an
abortion.''
   The governors' brief, dropped off at court offices Saturday,
said:
   ``It would be unprecedented for this court, having recognized a
fundamental constitutional right, to withdraw that right and throw
the abortion issue back into the political arena.''
   The governors expressed ``concern that the workable and
restraining constitutional guidelines that have developed since Roe
v. Wade may yield to laws that discriminate unfairly against large
segments of our population, are easily evaded by persons with
money, or are so widely ignored that evenhanded enforcement becomes
impossible.''
   They said they are also worried that respect for law is eroded
by statutes such as the Illinois one ``that purport to regulate
health when their true purpose _ restricting abortions _ is
apparent.''
   If the right to a first trimester abortion is abandoned, they
said, women's ability to choose ``would be determined primarily by
whether she fortuitously resides in, or has the ability to travel
to, a state where abortions'' remain legal.
   The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments Dec. 5 on the Illinois
statute, which a federal judge and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
already have struck down.
   However, a new bid is being made in Illinois to settle the case
before it goes any further.

<HEAD>Prisoner Release A Political Victory For ANC</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To CORRECT date of Durban rally, SUB 9th graf, `At a ... demonstration

Bjt ^By GREG MYRE</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unconditional release of
seven African National Congress leaders is a resounding political
victory for the guerrilla movement at a time its armed wing is
relatively dormant.
   The hero's welcome given to the political prisoners _ six jailed
for at least 25 years _ reflects the depth of support for the ANC
despite government repression throughout the movement's 77-year-old
history.
   The government outlawed the ANC in 1960, and President F.W. de
Klerk remains adamant that the organization must renounce violence
before it may participate in negotiations on a new constitution.
   However, the release of ANC leaders and de Klerk's recent
decision to allow peaceful mass protests, ``virtually amounts to de
facto validation of the banned ANC,'' said The Sunday Times, the
country's largest-circulation newspaper.
   ``At the very least, the de-demonization of the ANC has began,''
the newspaper said in an editorial.
   After their release, the seven spoke to hundreds of supporters
and journalists at a news conference. It was the first time ranking
ANC leaders were permitted to engage in political activity in South
Africa since the organization was banned.
   Government officials have conferred with the ANC's most
prominent jailed leader, Nelson Mandela, whose release is widely
expected in coming months. There is speculation Mandela wants the
ANC legalized as a political force before he leaves prison.
   ANC supporters, long denied the chance to express their
political sympathies, now wave the green, gold and black ANC flag
at marches _ an action that previously brought swift police action.
   At a rally in Durban last month, the ANC banner was raised at
city hall and police allowed it to remain on the flagpole until the
demonstration ended.
   Black-oriented newspapers now print articles favorable to the
ANC and run pictures of its imprisoned and exiled leaders _ in
outright defiance of government censorship laws.
   New Nation, one of the country's most militant opposition
newspapers, on Friday printed its entire front page in green, gold
and black and ran pictures of the seven former prisoners under the
headline, ``ANC Lives.''
   Such developments seemed unthinkable as recently as a year ago.
   De Klerk's predecessor as president, P.W. Botha, and his
security officials denounced the ANC as a communist-led terrorist
group. Botha said the guerrilla movement would be barred from any
negotiations on apartheid.
   In recent months, the ANC appeared to be regrouping, if not
retreating.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo, 71, suffered a stroke in August and
remains hospitalized in London. He has no clear successor, and
there has been speculation of a rift between ANC hardliners, who
want more military action, and political leaders who believe
negotiations are on the horizon.
   While the ANC publicly calls for an escalation of its armed
struggle, there have been fewer attacks this year than any time
since nationwide black unrest broke out in 1984.
   Since a state-of-emergency was declared in June 1986 more than
210 bombings have killed 37 people, but this year about 40 have
killed three.
   This year, the ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, had to close its
military bases in Angola under a regional peace treaty signed by
South Africa, Angola and Cuba.
   The organization won't say where its thousands of guerrillas
were sent. Reportedly, the fighters were moved to Uganda and
Tanzania, two countries with little day-to-day contact with
southern Africa.
   The South African government also has successfully eased its
diplomatic isolation on the continent. Botha and de Klerk met
several black African leaders in the past year.
   The ANC's bid to increase economic sanctions on South Africa has
waned, and few new punitive measures were imposed in the past two
years.
   The government can claim small victories, but the ANC's support,
particularly among the young, is stronger than ever.
   Thousands of black youths fled South Africa in 1976 amid
nationwide black violence to join the ANC and the organization says
that since 1984 it has received about 100 new recruits monthly.
   The organization has an estimated 15,000 members in exile, and
millions of supporters inside South Africa, where blacks comprise
28 million of the 37 million population.
   Most political analysts believe the ANC would receive the most
votes if free elections were held.
   Even relatively conservative black leaders say the ANC must be
legalized before serious negotiations on political change can take
place.

   Leftist guerrilla leaders and
officials of President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government open
negotiations today for a temporary cease-fire in El Salvador's
decade-old civil war.
   Spokesmen for the wo sides said the gulf between them was wide
and they expect no early agreement. But Roman Catholic Church
officials, who had acted as mediators in earlier meetings, said the
of two-day round of talks are the most substantial so far and they
are hopeful.
   ``We consider this meeting very important. It could be a
significant step toward peace,and that is why we are helping the
participants with our prayers,'' Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas,
the head of El Salvador's Catholic church, told reporters Sunday.
   But Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal, who is
playing host to the talks, had a different opinion: ``It would be a
miracle if an agreement is reached in these negotiations.''
   At a preliminary meeting in Mexico City last month, both sides
agreed to this week's talks and to subsequently meet at 30-day
intervals until a peace accord is reached.
   Three meetings by the preceding administration of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte's administration with guerrilla leaders from 1984
to 1987 all ended in deadlock, with the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front demanding to share power in a new
government before laying down its weapons.
   Cristiani succeeded Durate on June 1 for a five-year term. His
ultra-conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance had defeated
Duarte's centrist Christian Democrats in national elections in
which leftist groups refused to participate.
   Since then, the rebels have softened their demands.
   At the Mexico meeting, they offered for the first time to call a
temporary cease-fire by Nov. 15, form a political party and run
candidates in future elections if Cristiani agrees to undertake
wide-ranging social, political and constitutional reforms and
reduce military ranks.
   Cristiani, who is demanding an immediate cease-fire while talks
of reform continue, said Saturday that the rebels are expected to
step up attacks in coming days in an effort to bolster their
positions at the talks.
   Rebel spokesman Cesar Marti said Sunday that the front will not
agree to stop fighting unless terms _ including reforms _ are
agreed upon first, adding that ``the negotiations will be
difficult.''
   ``The government wants us to lay down our weapons and negotiate
afterwards. `But we want a temporary truce and progressively work
towards a definite cease-fire, with absolute guarantees there will
be true democracy in our country,'' he said.
   According to human rights groups, more than 70,000 people have
been killed in the civil war and the United States has been
providing $1 million daily in military and economic aid to prop up
a succession of Salvadoran governments.
   The talks were to be held at a church retreat in Moravia, a
small town six miles northeast of San Jose, and monitored by church
leaders, and observers from the United Nations and the Organization
of American States.
   The talks are being held within the framework of peace accords
Cristiani and four other Central American presidents signed in
Honduras in August to end the Salvadoran war, a U.S.-supported
Contral rebel war in Nicaragua and a long-simmering leftist
insurgency in Guatemala.
   Before the talks open, Marti said the nine-member rebel
leadership would meet with President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who
won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring a regional peace plan.

   In a papal pilgrimage filled with
guarded gestures, none stood out more than the East Timor kiss.
   It underlined the tightrope Pope John Paul II walked as he
toured Indonesia, the world's most populous Moslem country, for
five days before reaching this Indian Ocean island.
   The pope treaded softly when he touched on such controversial
issues as human rights, the Roman Catholic Church's position
against contraception or pressures on Catholics from Moslem
extremists.
   But nothing provoked more debate than whether John Paul kissed
the ground of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony invaded and
annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
   John Paul has kissed the ground each time he arrived in a new
country on his 44 foreign tours.
   Indonesian authorities were relieved when he made no such move
upon arriving in East Timor. They had posted billboards beside the
airport tarmac welcoming him to Indonesia's ``27th province.''
   Although the Vatican, like the United Nations, doesn't
officially recognize the Indonesian claim on East Timor, John
Paul's hosts viewed his stop as bolstering their position.
   But 90 minutes later, when the pope arrived at a dusty seaside
field to celebrate Mass, he knelt beneath the altar and kissed a
crucifix resting on a pillow on the ground.
   Applause rang out from the crowd of 100,000 people, indicating
people believed he had done the deed. Or had he?
   A Vatican official rushed to tell reporters that kissing the
crucifix was merely a ``pastoral gesture,'' done by every bishop
when he enters a new diocese.
   For Kiku's Corner, a front-page column in the English-langauge
Indonesia Times, the pope kissed the soil only once _ upon arriving
in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
   ``It's thus a recognition of East Timor as part of the
Indonesian country. No doubt about it,'' Kiku told his readers.
   The Vatican insists that no obstacles were placed in the pope's
way during the trip and that he spoke with ``absolute freedom.''
   But he clearly made choices, as he has on past trips when, for
example, the price of visiting Paraguay was a meeting with the
former authoritarian ruler, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   One such choice, according to a Vatican official, was not to
upset the ``delicate balance'' in Indonesia, which unites some 200
ethnic and language groups.
   For this reason, the explanation goes, John Paul did not visit
ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples in Java, near where he
celebrated Mass. He also didn't step inside a model mosque when
visiting a miniature reconstruction of Indonesia in Jakarta.
   Expert knowledge was required to decipher the codewords in his
speeches. The pope spoke of ``traditional practices and other
contemporary social influences'' contrasting with church teaching
on the family, an apparent reference to polygamy and the
government's active family-planning program.
   One thing John Paul could not escape was the heat on his 10-day
pilgrimmage that took him from Indian summer in Seoul, South Korea,
to sweltering Indonesia and Mauritius.
   The fair-skinned pope, born 69 years ago in the cool of Poland,
reddened from standing hatless in open cars waving to the crowds.
Temperatures were in the 90s.
   The pope returned to Rome today, the eleventh anniversary of his
election as pontiff.

   Anti-nuclear activists say weekend protests
that resulted in about 475 arrests show that their 13-year-old
fight against the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant remains
spirited.
   ``I'm thrilled with the way things have gone,'' Dianne Dunfey of
the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance said Sunday as about 200
protesters rallied at the Statehouse. ``They (Seabrook proponents)
thought we'd go away a long time ago.''
   On Saturday, Dunfey and the others scaled fences surrounding the
seacoast plant and were arrested for trespassing.
   Today, a small group of activists planned a sit-in at Gov. Judd
Gregg's outer office until he meets with them to discuss Seabrook.
   The protests were part of a week of anti-Seabrook events
scheduled to culminate with a rally near President Bush's vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Seabrook was finished in 1986 and conducted low-power atomic
tests this summer, but the $6.2 billion reactor still lacks a
commercial license because of challenges to evacuation plans for
nearby beaches and communities in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
   Anti-Seabrook demonstrations since 1976 have resulted in more
than 3,600 arrests and made the plant a symbol of the nation's
anti-nuclear movement.
   ``The fight is far from over. And, in many ways, the fight has
just started,'' said Massachusetts state Sen. Nicholas Costello,
one of Sunday's speakers.
   But the police chief in the town of Seabrook, Paul Cronin, said
he is considering a new weapon against Clamshell organizers _ the
federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a decision in which an
abortion clinic used RICO to win damages from an anti-abortion
group in Philadelphia. Cronin said he wants to determine whether he
can use the law against Clamshell leaders.
   The chief said Seabrook opponents have a right to climb over the
plant's fences to be arrested, but not to incite others to follow
them.
   ``They rouse up those people and brought them to the town with
the express idea of breaking the law,'' Cronin said.
   Roy Morrison, one of four Clamshell leaders identified as
targets for possible harsher treatment, countered: ``The
authorities are willing to destroy the basic fabric that protects
freedom in this country _ freedom of citizens to speak, associate
and take action.''

   With a boost from President Bush,
Republican Tom Anderson is racing to make up ground in Tuesday's
special election that could cost the GOP its last U.S. House seat
in Mississippi.
   Based on returns in the primary election and recent polls,
Democratic state Sen. Gene Taylor is the front-runner to take the
5th District seat Republicans have held 16 years.
   Anderson, 43, is an aide to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., a national
spokesman on conservative issues who formerly held the south
Mississippi House seat now being contested.
   Anderson acknowledges he's chasing Taylor.
   ``It has been a long campaign in a very short period of time.
We've got a long way to go. And, I am the underdog, but we can do
it,'' Anderson said at a rally last week.
   Taylor, 36, who represents Bay St. Louis in the Legislature,
captured 42 percent in Oct. 3's open primary, while Anderson
finished second with 37 percent.
   The seat become vacant when freshman Republican Rep. Larkin
Smith, a popular former sheriff, died in an Aug. 13 plane crash.
Smith won the office in 1988, beating Taylor.
   The national parties view the campaign as a key battleground
less than a year before the 1990 congressional elections.
   Bush visited last week at Lott's urging and appeared at a rally
for Anderson.
   ``Part of the legacy of Larkin Smith is making sure that his
successor carries on the work you sent him to do in Washington. I
know Tom Anderson is the right man,'' Bush said.
   ``Tommy took on two Democrats who ganged up on him at every
turn, and tried to smear his good name,'' said Rep. Guy Vander
Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ``But Tom remained on the high road and continued to run
on the issues, and he was rewarded for that by the intelligent
voters of Mississippi's 5th District.''
   The candidates differ little on issues.
   Anderson has tried to pin the ``liberal'' label on Taylor, who
contends his voting record in the Mississippi Senate is
conservative.
   ``I'm a conservative Southern Democrat,'' Taylor has said.
   The district, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi on the thriving
coast, has a history of voting Republican. It twice rejected
southerner Jimmy Carter and went 87 percent for Richard Nixon in
1972, the highest percentage he won in any congressional district.
   In 1972, Lott, then a top aide to U.S. Rep. Bill Colmer, was
elected to Congress from the district. Lott, who was minority whip,
gave up the seat to win the Senate post of the retiring Democrat
John C. Stennis in 1988.
   Anderson has been Lott's chief of staff since 1972, except for
two years as he spent as ambassador to Barbados during the Reagan
administration.
   Anderson has spent more than $500,000 bolstering his name
recognition after living in Washington for 17 years. Taylor has
spent more than $100,000.
   Anderson also has had to deal with the appearance of being
Lott's hand-picked candidate.
   Lott rallied Republicans around Anderson after clearing the
field of other Republicans, including Sheila Smith, wife of the
late congressman.
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has filed two
ethics complaints against Anderson _ for allegedly failing to list
all flights he took while a Lott aide on the jet of a Mississippi
corporation, and for alleged discrepancies between financial
disclosure statements filed with the Senate and House.
   Anderson and the Republicans have labeled the complaints as
smear tactics, but Democrats contend the issues are real.
   ``Mississippi has a long history of sending members to Congress
who are beyond reproach when it comes to integrity and honesty,''
said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of his party's
congressional campaign committee. ``Tom Anderson is a walking
ethics scandal. The voters of the 5th District can't possibly
approve of these actions by Mr. Anderson.''
   If Taylor wins the election, the Democrats would have all five
Mississippi seats in the U.S. House for the first time since 1972.

   Ferdinand E. Marcos was entombed in an
air-conditioned mausoleum as thousands of loyalists said farewell
to the ousted Philippines president.
   The mausoleum also is outfitted with a small chandelier; a
religious statue surrounded by flowers sits on a shelf. Marcos'
favorite slippers, pajamas and golf cap were placed in his coffin,
said Col. Arturo Aruiza, a Marcos adviser for 21 years.
   ``He was my hero, he was my general. He was my teacher, my
friend. He was my father,'' Ferdinand Marcos Jr., said during the
tribute to his father Sunday.
   Later the son, who is known as ``Bong Bong,'' told the crowd,
``Weep not, for you sat at the feet of a man touched by God.''
   Enrique Fernando, the last Philippine Supreme Court chief
justice during Marcos' presidency, collapsed during the speech in
hot, humid weather and was taken to St. Francis Medical Center.
   Marcos died at the hospital Sept. 28 at age 72. He had lived in
exile in Honolulu since February 1986, when he was ousted by a
civilian-military uprising following a disputed election, and
replaced by Corazon Aquino.
   Hospital officials said the 74-year-old Fernando was stable
Sunday night. Marcos spokesman Roger Peyuan said Fernando has a
history of heart disease, but didn't suffer a heart attack.
   More than 2,500 people waited hours for Marcos' widow, Imelda,
to arrive at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park with her
husband's body.
   More than a dozen men rolled Marcos' casket up a long, winding
hillside drive, with hundreds of mourners walking behind. When the
pallbearers reached the stairs leading to the small mausoleum,
elderly retired Philippine generals were replaced by younger men.
   Marcos' widow wants to return his body to the Philippines for
burial, but Mrs. Aquino has refused, saying it could provoke
unrest. Marcos' followers have asked the country's Supreme Court to
overturn the ban but there is no indication when the 15-judge panel
will issue a ruling.
   The mausoleum was designed as a temporary resting place in hopes
the remains will eventually be returned.
   At the ceremony, there were prayers and a blessing by Monsignor
Domingo Nebres, the Philippine priest who drew the wrath of the
Honolulu Catholic Diocese for comparing Marcos to Jesus Christ
during a funeral Mass Friday.
   Mrs. Marcos sang ``Ave Maria'' and ``The Lord's Prayer.''
   The service took a more political turn when Philippines pop star
Imelda Papin, Mrs. Marcos' partner in a recent commercial recording
duet, sang the Philippine national anthem. Adding to the atmosphere
was the speech by the son, widely believed to have political
aspirations in his homeland.
   The Marcoses were charged with criminal racketeering in New
York. The charges accuse them of plundering $200 million from the
Philippine treasury.

   Investigators seeking the cause of a flash
fire that gutted a parked Delta Air Lines jetliner said they are
focusing on an area in the belly of the Boeing 727 that houses
computer gear.
   A team of federal inspectors arrived Sunday to join the
investigation of the blaze, which burned a 4-by-15-foot hole in the
side of the plane as it sat at a Salt Lake International Airport
boarding gate.
   Saturday's fire forced the nine passengers and six crew members
aboard to evacuate. Five crew members and one passenger were
treated for smoke inhalation.
   The investigation, assisted by representatives of Delta and
Boeing Co., should take three or four days, said Bob Johnson,
regional director for the National Transportation Safety Board in
Denver.
   The fire broke out 20 minutes before Flight 1558 was to leave
for Edmonton, Alberta. The flight, which began in Los Angles, had a
one-hour layover in Salt Lake City and most passengers were in the
terminal.
   Those aboard reported hearing a loud pop before smoke began
billowing from a vent in the first-class section.
   Early indications are the fire broke out in a spot below and
behind the cockpit, where the plane's computer and avionics nerve
center are housed, said Johnson and Delta spokesman Fred Rollins.
   ``We are focusing on that area,'' Rollins said. ``But it's
really too early to speculate on the cause.''
   Investigators have determined that the fire didn't begin in the
baggage area. FAA officials initially sealed the plane and kept the
baggage from being returned to the passengers, but Rollins said the
luggage was released later.
   Firefighters extinguished the flames within 15 minutes,
authorities said.
   Delta has yet to determine if the $30 million airliner can be
flown again, said Rollins, who was unable to provide a damage
estimate.
   The fire heavily damaged the aircraft's interior and melted
portions of the metal skin.

   Panamanian soldiers tried to overthrow Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega because of his constant drinking and corruption,
which left troops so poor they had to mend their own boots, the
wife of the slain coup leader says.
   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, who was the first person to make
contact between the conspirators and U.S. officials, described the
mood among the rebels before the Oct. 3 revolt led by her husband,
Maj. Moises Giroldi.
   ``My husband was once stationed in Nicaragua, and he always said
to me, `It can't continue this way _ we are on the same road as
Nicaragua under Somoza. The officers are corrupt and we will end up
the same as Somoza,''' the 36-year-old Mrs. Giroldi said of the
late Anastasio Somoza.
   She fled to Miami with her three children, her brother and her
parents after the failed coup.
   Giroldi was named to the top security post at Noriega's central
headquarters after he helped put down a coup in March 1988. But
while Noriega grew wealthy, Giroldi and other loyal military
officers saw their countrymen and their troops' situation
deteriorate, his wife said in an interview last week.
   ``The people were hungry. The soldiers were hungry,'' she said.
``There were units where they don't even have enough money to take
a bus home. If their boots have holes, they must repair them
themselves.''
   In addition, she said, Noriega drank to excess and behaved
erratically.
   ``General Noriega spends all day drinking, 24 hours a day
drinking, so he can make decisions,'' she said.
   She said he fires ministers and banishes officers based on what
his inner circle tells him while he is drunk.
   On Sept. 29, Giroldi told his wife he planned to lead fellow
officers in a coup, arrest Noriega and turn him over to the U.S.
military. They never planned to kill him, she said.
   Then on Oct. 1, she said, he asked her to get in touch with U.S.
officials because it was too risky for him and the other officers.
   A friend who worked with the U.S. military arranged a meeting
between Mrs. Giroldi and a U.S. colonel.
   She told the colonel the rebels needed the United States to send
flights over Panamanian air bases to keep Noriega loyalists on the
ground. They also wanted U.S. roadblocks around Noriega's downtown
headquarters.
   The colonel called in two Americans in street clothes who later
met with her husband. Giroldi said he was elated with the U.S.
response.
   On Oct. 2, her husband reported to headquarters. She visited him
in the barracks that night. She would never see him again.
   The next morning she took her family to Fort Clayton, a U.S.
base outside Panama City. But because the coup plans were secret,
the officer on duty wouldn't let her in at first, she said.
   ``I didn't know whether to trust him or not. It was a very
difficult situation,'' Mrs. Giroldi said. She was quite literally
saved by the bell.
   ``The alarm went off and they were yelling, `Alert,' to everyone
in Fort Clayton,'' she recalled. ``He asked why I was there, and I
answered, `For the alert.' ''
   Later, soldiers who survived the coup, including Capt. Javier
Licona, the highest-ranking plotter to escape, helped her piece
together what happened.
   At first it went according to plan, she said. Noriega was
captured, and tried to negotiate with Giroldi, but her husband
refused, she said
   Then, she said, they realized a fellow conspirator, Maj.
Federico Oleochea, head of the strongest local unit, Battalion
2000, had betrayed them and was surrounding the barracks.
   ``If Major Oleochea had not turned on us, all would have been
well, all would have been as planned,'' she said. ``But he is the
type who always bets on the winner.''
   Licona tried to call in American help using an emergency number
given Giroldi at the meeting, but the officials doubted Licona's
identity, she said. Licona had to leave the headquarters and go to
Fort Clayton to convince them.
   ``There was a lot of trouble trying to identify him,'' she said.
``Confirming this, confirming that. When they finally said they
were going to act, it was very late. That was the failure.''
   Giroldi and his fellow conspirators apparently surrendered. Some
Panamanians said Giroldi was shot personally by Noriega. But a
soldier who survived told her all of the prisoners, including her
husband, were lined up and mowed down with a machine gun.

   Anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu,
resuming the struggle on his first day of freedom in 26 years, told
an emotional crowd he's confident he'll see the day a black man can
become president.
   The government freed Sisulu and seven other aging anti-apartheid
leaders at dawn Sunday and the seven who belong to the African
National Congress held the guerrilla movement's first news
conference in South Africa since it was banned in 1960.
   ``Our determination has never been weakened by our long years of
imprisonment,'' said Sisulu, a former ANC secretary general and the
country's best-known black leader after the still-imprisoned Nelson
Mandela.
   Some among the hundreds of ANC supporters packing the church
hall where the news conference was held wept as the freed
prisoners, raising clenched fists, led them in singing ``God Bless
Africa,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.
   Sisulu said the seven, aged 60 to 80, were confident they would
live to see ``a government that includes blacks ... a democratic
method where a black man can become president, or a white man can
become president.''
   Today, newspapers across the political spectrum said the release
had ushered in a new era that will be full of dramatic change and
uncertainty.
   ``The country enters a new phase in its history,'' the
pro-government Citizen said in an editorial. ``But it is not going
to be an easy transition ... (and) nobody knows what kind of new
country will emerge.''
   The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily,
cautioned that the freed black leaders face a daunting task: ``that
of uniting the democratic forces in this country and transforming
it into a non-racial democracy.''
   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, concurred.
   ``This is only the start of a long and complex process,'' wrote
editor Ken Owen. ``What is said by Sisulu and his colleagues this
week will be as important for creating a negotiating climate as
President (F.W.) de Klerk's bold move in ordering their freedom.''
   De Klerk announced the unconditional release of the eight
Tuesday as part of his attempt to improve conditions for
negotiating a new constitution that will extend political rights to
blacks.
   But he envisions some arrangement under which whites would
retain veto power over major decisions. Under apartheid, the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.
   The releases are viewed as tacit acknowledgement by the
government of the ANC's influence and popularity.
   Sisulu, 77, told the news conference that he had felt pressure
building for his release and ``that sooner or later they would have
to give in ... It was not possible to despair because the spirit of
the people outside was too great.''
   Even relatively conservative black leaders have said they will
reject any negotiations with the government unless the ANC is
legalized and its jailed leaders freed.
   Sisulu and his colleagues said the ANC, the largest group
fighting the white-led government, will continue its military
campaign and reject negotiations until the government legalizes it,
lifts the 3-year-old state of emergency and releases all political
prisoners.
   ``If the government doesn't meet our demands, we have no
alternative but to continue to fight for our freedom,'' said Andrew
Mlangeni, 63.
   The ex-prisoners, seated in front of a large green, gold and
black ANC flag at the news conference, also said they would press
for Mandela's release.
   ``There can be no real joy about our release when we think of
the comrades we left behind,'' Sisulu said.
   Mandela, 71, is widely expected to be released in the next few
months. But there is speculation he does not want to go free until
the government takes further steps to legalize ANC political
activity.
   Five of the ANC men, including Sisulu and Mlangeni, were
arrested in 1963 and sentenced to life prison terms in 1964, along
with Mandela, for plotting anti-government sabotage.
   The others freed Sunday were Elias Mostsoaledi, 65; Ahmed
Kathrada, 60; Raymond Mhlaba, 68; Wilton Mkwayi, 67; and Oscar
Mpetha, 80, who had been hospitalized in Cape Town and was the
nation's oldest political prisoner.
   The eighth man is 58-year-old Jafta Masemola of the outlawed Pan
Africanist Congress, a smaller guerrilla group. He was convicted of
sabotage in 1963.
   All except Mpetha had served at least 25 years.
   The ANC seven spoke directly to their supporters after the news
conference. ``We are not the heroes. You are the heroes,'' said
Kathrada.
   At least 10,000 greeted Kathrada, an Indian, later Sunday night
when he arrived in the Lenasia, the main Indian township outside
Johannesburg.
   The ANC leaders said they would seek passports to travel to the
ANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to consult with their
colleagues.

   Japanese investors' message to Wall Street today
was: ``It's up to you now. We held on.''
   Instead of unloading their shares in panic as they did two years
ago after Wall Street crashed, most Japanese market players were in
a holding pattern.
   They watched anxiously today as the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted
a sharp, but not disastrous, loss in thin trading.
   ``I did not sell much, but it's tough to buy shares on a day
like today,'' said Hiroshi Yamamoto, a private investor watching
price displays before the Ginza branch of Nikko Securities Co. in
central Tokyo.
   ``Depending on how New York will do, today's drop may turn out
to be just timely relief for the Tokyo market, or an omen of
another crash,'' he said.
   Dealers and traders tried to build confidence and show they
learned from the 1987 crash, while investors remained calm compared
with two years ago.
   ``I don't think there were many investors who sold their
holdings in panic,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a dealer with Kidder
Peabody Securities in Tokyo. ``It was nothing like two years ago
when investors rushed to the brokerages to unload their holdings.
   ``So many investors only lost money two years ago when they sold
their shares quickly after Black Monday in New York, and these
shares quickly won back their loses,'' Nishida said. ``They have
learned lessons from that experience.''
   A day after Black Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 23 percent, the Nikkei average lost about 15 percent. But
the barometer gained back most losses in the next two days.
   The Nikko Securities retail brokerage office was somewhat busier
than usual today. Scores of phone calls poured in from investors
anxious to find out where their holdings stood.
   ``I am telling you that it's not time to sell yet. It's not too
late if we wait until tomorrow and see how New York will do,'' a
broker was overheard saying on the phone.
   Some investors said they were waiting for bargains rather than
to unload their shares.
   ``I expect the Nikkei index to remain bearish all day, but I am
not so worried because we all know it is due to external factors,''
said an investor watching the key index at Nomura Securities
shortly after the market opened.
   ``I am going to sit and wait for a while and start buying shares
later on as they start hitting the bottom,'' he said.
   A dealer at Nikko Securities said, ``Japanese private investors
seemed to have learned the lesson that fluctuation of the Wall
Street index is only one of many aspects of the Tokyo market. It is
undoubtedly an important element, but not necessarily as dominant
as it was thought to be.''
   Nishida said many investors remained hesitant to place purchase
orders today because ``they want to make sure that the New York
plunge was only a one-time thing, and the Dow Jones will not go
down further there.''
   Some investors said there was no reason why the Tokyo market
should suffer because of New York.
   ``If Tokyo plunges after New York, the whole world is in
trouble,'' said Motoko Goto, a veteran private investor.
   ``I think the Dow Jones average fell in New York because it was
Friday the 13th,'' she said. ``It may have a negative implication
in the Christian world, but there is no reason it should depress
the stock market in Japan.''

<HEAD>Hurricane Jerry Hits Texas Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Remnants of Hurricane Jerry drenched Texas today after the storm
roared ashore in Galveston with sustained winds of 80 mph and gusts
to 100 mph.
   Before withering into a tropical depression early today, Jerry
spun off a half-dozen tornadoes inland, blacked out at least 52,000
homes and businesses and cut off phone service to Galveston Island.
   Tides along the Gulf Coast were 5 to 8 feet above normal as
Jerry's landfall coincided with an unusually high tide caused by a
rare alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. But Gary Vasquez of the
Galveston emergency operations center reported only minor street
flooding.
   Elsewhere, severe storms produced a tornado and large hail in
northern Michigan on Sunday. The tornado touched down in Buckley,
on Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula, knocking down trees and
destroying at least one mobile home, said Sgt. Marty Dahlstrom of
the Wexford County Sheriff's Department said
   The Michigan storms produced wind gusts to 85 mph and hail as
large as ping-pong balls, the National Weather Service said.
   Snow fell this morning in the higher elevations of Colorado and
Wyoming.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were reported in central
Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota. Light showers extended across
central Minnesota into central South Dakota.
   High temperatures Sunday were in the 40s from northern Minnesota
to the northern half of the high Plains and in the 30s in the
central Rocky Mountains. Temperatures reached the 90s in parts of
Florida, Texas and the desert Southwest. Records were tied in
Baltimore, 89, and Kansas City, 84.

<HEAD>US Officials Protest To Soviets in Espionage Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials today lodged a formal protest with
Soviet authorities after two Soviet officers were allegedly caught
trying to obtain classified military documents from a U.S. Air
Force airman in West Berlin.
   Anthony Sariti, a spokesman for the U.S. diplomatic mission in
West Berlin, said the protest was filed after two Soviet majors
were ``apprehended while engaging in espionage activities.''
   Sariti said Sunday night that the U.S. Air Force airman, whose
name was not released, was caught in the act of passing classified
information to the Soviets.
   But he said today that he had been mistaken, that the airman had
not been caught in the act. Sariti said he had erred Sunday night
because he did not at that time have with him the official news
release prepared in the case.
   Sariti said today that the Soviets were detained after asking
the airman to hand over documents on Saturday night. He said the
airman was cooperating with authorities.
   Sariti would not say how serious the case was.
   Both Soviet officers were questioned and then returned to ``the
Soviet sector,'' Sariti said in reference to East Berlin.
   He refused to say where the meeting had taken place and declined
to provide further details.
   He said returning the Soviets to East Berlin after questioning
was ``normal procedure.''
   Sariti said agreements with the Soviets regarding the divided
city provide that ``(military) forces from one side cannot be
arrested by the forces on the other side.''
   He said U.S. officials lodged a verbal protest with the Soviets
on Saturday night. Sariti said the Soviets had not responded to the
protests as of late this morning.

<HEAD>Michigan Schoolgirl Upsets Town With Noriega Visits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEGAUNEE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A schoolgirl's friendly visits with
Panamanian pen pal Gen. Manuel Noriega have her neighbors and her
congressman shaking their heads.
   ``If it was my daughter, she wouldn't be going,'' City
Councilwoman Virginia Paulson said after 11-year-old Sarah York
left last week for her second trip to Panama.
   On Wednesday, Sarah and her father turned up beside Noriega as
Panama's military leader lauded her as a ``meritorious daughter''
of Panama City and an example of ``the truth of the United States,
purity not hatred.''
   After her meeting with Noriega, she repeated her support for the
general. She said he's ``very nice'' and she doesn't believe ``the
bad things newspapers in the United States say about him.''
   In the United States that day, U.S. leaders were talking about
ways to oust Noriega.
   Rep. Bob Davis, R-Mich., said Sarah's visits to Noriega put the
United States in an awkward position.
   ``To have one of our little citizens go down there and be
treated well is kind of an embarrassment for our government,''
Davis said. ``It sends the wrong message that we, or some people in
this country, say Noriega is an all-right guy.''
   The schoolgirl and her father, Mitchell, a prison guard, left
for Panama on Oct. 8 and planned to return Tuesday to this northern
mining town of about 5,000 people. The trip, which the Yorks say is
safe despite a State Department travel warning, was delayed by the
Oct. 3 coup attempt.
   The girl visited Noriega last October.
   She sent her first letter to Noriega following his U.S.
indictment on drug trafficking charges.
   Her mother, Pauline, who accompanied her on the first visit but
stayed behind this time, refuses to discuss the second trip.
   Mayor Jack Morris said residents never had given much thought to
Panama.
   ``It was nice to have somebody go to another country,'' he said.
   But he rejected Mrs. York's request that Negaunee find a sister
city in Panama.
   ``It just wouldn't be proper,'' Morris said.
   After her first trip, Sarah set up school exhibits and helped
classmates become pen pals with children in Panama. Negaunee
Schools Superintendent Don Mourand said very few parents complained.
   ``I believe parental choice is certainly come to force here,''
Mourand said. ``The parents of Sarah have decided to allow her to
be exposed to many things the average child is not exposed to. ...
Unfortunately she's being characterized by many people as being
naive, as being non-American.
   ``She just has a natural curiosity about other people,'' Mourand
said.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Arrives In Egypt For First Visit In 16 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Mubarak, Gadhafi arriving;
No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERSA MATRUH, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
arrived in this seaside resort today for talks with President Hosni
Mubarak, a milestone in ending one of the Arab world's bitterest
feuds.
   The leaders were to discuss regional affairs and resuming
diplomatic relations, Egyptian sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Talks will concentrate on bilateral relations and how to
develop them,'' one source said.
   Gadhafi traveled the 150 miles from the frontier between the
North African neighbors to this historic town in a motorcade.
Mubarak flew from Cairo to Mersa Matruh. Welcoming ceremonies with
an honor guard and presentation of flowers were performed at the
airport.
   Mubarak and Gadhafi were to spend the night in Mersa Matrouh, a
popular Mediterranean resort 300 miles northwest of Cairo, then
travel to the Libyan border town of Tobruk for more talks on
Tuesday, sources in Cairo said.
   The visit is Gadhafi's first to Egypt in 16 years, but his
second meeting with Mubarak this year.
   Gadhafi led Arab opposition to Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with
Israel and was considered an archenemy until May, when he and
Mubarak met at an Arab summit in Morocco.
   After the reconciliation, the two countries opened their
borders, closed for 12 years, and land and air travel between the
nations resumed.
   Each country's media toned down persistent carping about the
other. The official Libyan agency stopped using the phrase
``Oppressed Egyptian Capital'' for Cairo.
   Unlike most visits to Egypt by Arab leaders, when host cities
are decked with banners and posters, no such signs of welcome were
in evidence in Mersa Matruh. There was, however, a notable increase
in security on city streets.
   Of the 17 Arab countries that broke relations with Egypt after
Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, made peace with Israel, only
Libya and Syria have not resumed diplomatic ties.
   Gadhafi last visited Egypt in November 1973 when he joined Sadat
in a special Parliament session honoring top Egyptian military
officers for their performance in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
   But relations had already begun to sour a year earlier, when
Sadat refused overtures by Gadhafi to merge the two countries.
Gadhafi threatened to lead Libyan civilians on a march across the
border to enforce the merger.
   Relations further deteriorated in 1974 after Sadat's
rapprochement with the United States and his preliminary steps
toward peace with Israel, a move in which Egypt still stands alone
among the Arabs.
   Egypt blamed Libya for several bombings in Cairo and other
cities in 1975 to 1976, and the two fought a five-day border war in
July 1977. The border was sealed after that and remained closed
until after the May summit in Casablanca.

   Here are profiles of the seven
South African political prisoners freed Sunday with Walter Sisulu.
Five were tried and sentenced in 1964, along with Nelson Mandela,
to life in prison for sabotage and conspiracy in a trial in the
Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia.

<TEXT>
   AHMED KATHRADA:
   Kathrada, arrested at age 17 for participation in a passive
resistance campaign in 1946, was a member of the high command of
the African National Congress' military wing. He is one of only two
Rivonia defendants who denied all the charges against him. He was
convicted on only one count, sabotage.
   Kathrada was born Aug. 21, 1929, in the western Transvaal to a
scholarly Moslem family and became involved in politics at age 11.
He joined the Communist Party in the early 1940s and as general
secretary of the Transvaal Indian Congress was instrumental in
linking it to the African National Congress. He was acquitted in
the 1956-61 mass treason trial but placed under house arrest in
1962. He went underground a few months before his arrest at Rivonia.

<TEXT>
   ELIAS MOTSOALEDI:
   As a founder of the Johannesburg regional command of the ANC's
military wing, Motsoaledi hid recruits and helped send them abroad
for military training and procuring arms, prosecutors alleged at
the Rivonia trial. He said he joined the military wing in 1962.
   Born in northern Transvaal Province on July 26, 1924, the son of
a migrant laborer, Motsoaledi worked in Johannesburg as a servant
and at factories. He joined the Communist Party in 1949 and the
congress in 1948.
   In 1949, he became chairman of the Council of Non-European Trade
Unions, organized strikes and was banned in 1952. He was held in
solitary confinement for three months in 1960 before going
underground. His wife, Caroline, lives in Soweto. Three of their
seven children are in exile.

   RAYMOND MHLABA:
   At the Rivonia trial, Mhlaba denied he belonged to the high
command of the ANC's military wing. But he was identified in the
South African press as the man who became commander-in-chief after
the arrest in 1962 of Mandela.
   In 1952, Mhlaba was the first congress leader arrested as part
of the defiance campaign, when he led blacks through the ``whites
only'' entrance to a train station.
   He was born Dec. 2, 1920, son of a policeman. He dropped out of
school, became active in trade unions in Port Elizabeth, joined the
Communist Party in 1943 and the congress in 1944.
   In 1986, prison authorities allowed him to marry the mother of
three of his eight children.

<TEXT>
   ANDREW MLANGENI:
   Mlangeni said at the Rivonia trial he had agreed to carry
messages for the ANC's military wing, but he denied he was a
member. He was accused during the trial of being responsible for
explosives and being a member of the Johannesburg command.
   Born in Johannesburg on May 30, 1926, he worked as a golf caddy
to pay for school and later as a clerk, bus driver and journalist.
He joined the ANC in 1951 and was regional secretary for the
township of Soweto from 1958-60, before he went underground.

   WILTON MKWAYI:
   Mkwayi, 66, briefly took command of the ANC's military wing
after the arrest of Mandela's colleagues in 1963. He was arrested
shortly afterwards and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 after
being convicted on 58 counts of sabotage. The judge said Mkwayi
received guerrilla training in China and had taught ANC members how
to make bombs. In 1987, Mkwayi was allowed to marry his common-law
wife, Irene. She died in December.

   JAFTA MASEMULA:
   Masemula, 58, a member of the outlawed Pan Africanist Congress
guerrilla organization, was sentenced to life in prison in 1963 for
sabotage. At the time of his arrest in 1961, he was a primary
school teacher in Atteridgeville, near Pretoria. Some other members
of the Pan Africanist Congress were freed last year after agreeing
to a government offer of release in exchange for renunciation of
violence. Masemula refused to do so.

   OSCAR MPETHA:
   The country's oldest political prisoner, 80-year-old Mpetha
began campaigning for black rights as a union organizer in the
1940s. A diabetic, he had a leg amputated in 1983 and been
hospitalized for most of the past three years.
   Born Aug. 5, 1909, he joined the ANC in 1951 and became its Cape
Town regional chairman in 1958. He helped found the
Communist-oriented South African Congress of Trade Unions.
   In 1980, he was charged with murder and terrorism in connection
with the slaying of two whites at a roadblock erected by black
youths near Cape Town. He was convicted of terrorism in 1983 and
began a five-year sentence in 1985 after losing an appeal.
   In August 1983, Mpetha was elected co-president of the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition.
   Mpetha's wife and a son died while he was jailed. He was denied
permission to attend the funerals.

<HEAD>Shares Fall In Early Trading, Then Recover Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Share prices plummeted in heavy but orderly
trading on London's stock market today in response to Wall Street's
plunge on Friday, then recovered slightly as bargain hunters
stepped in.
   Shares fell sharply on other European exchanges, then
stabilized. In Amsterdam, a limit was imposed on price declines,
and in Milan and Paris, trading in some shares was suspended
because of insufficient buying orders.
   In Brussels, an unusually heavy volume and order imbalance
delayed the start of computer-assisted trading by an hour.
   The London market, Europe's largest, was less panicky than
during the October 1987 crash, and the Stock Exchange said the
trading system was holding up well.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down
142.4 points, or 6.4 percent, at 2,091.5 two hours after it opened
and volume was a heavy 387.4 million shares.
   The index had opened 157.1 points _ down 6.8 percent. In trading
before London's exchange officially opened, the index was estimated
down 200 points, or 9 percent.
   Dealers are allowed to trade stocks outside exchange hours, and
it was during the pre-opening trading that bargain hunters entered
the market and triggered the partial recovery.
   ``There isn't the same panic as there was during the 1987
crash,'' said Bob Wade, joint head of market making at Robert
Fleming and Co. ``So the pressure on the dealing machinery hasn't
been so intense.''
   Charles Larkum, an equity analyst at the London investment firm
James Capel and Co., said, ``The market is looking for a level
which it is comfortable holding.''
   The dollar also sank and then partially recovered in European
trading. It was quoted at $1.5785 to the pound at midmorning
compared with $1.5625 late Friday. The dollar cost 1.8561 West
German marks and 140.99 Japanese yen, down from 1.9025 marks and
144 yen late Friday.
   Market makers, who are required to make continuous prices
available in certain stocks, were quoting prices on the exchange's
screen-based trading system normally, the exchange said.
   On Friday, Wall Street slumped after the London market closed
for the weekend, and initially, London investors were not reassured
by a relatively calm response in Tokyo earlier today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before London dealings begin, the
Nikkei Stock Average fell 647.33 points, or 1.8 percent, to close
at 34,468.69 today.
   The Securities Association, which governs the London Stock
Exchange, met early today to assess Asia's response. Some
stockbrokers stayed in central London hotels overnight to get an
early start in trading.
   Stock Exchange Chairman Andrew Hugh Smith said before trading
began: ``I certainly do not think there is any reason to panic.''
   London market makers moved prices sharply lower in an effort to
protect themselves from any flood of sell orders, dealers said.
   ``It's havoc at the moment but we expect the market to stabilize
at lower levels ahead of the New York opening later Monday,'' said
Richard Dingwall-Smith, an economist at the London investment firm
County Natwest Woodmac Securities.
   Analysts said the London market was concerned that a fresh burst
of computer-driven selling on New York later today could drag the
market sharply lower.
   The plunge of 190 points in Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial
average Friday occurred two years after a 108-point Dow drop
presaged the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash of a record 508
points.
   The Bank of England said Saturday it saw ``no reason for such an
exaggerated fall in London share values.''
   It said it regarded the New York price fall as ``a special case,
sparked off by the collapse of the high-risk `junk bond' market,
which does not exist on anything like the same scale in London.''
   Michael Hughes, an economist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
said on BBC-TV that the apparent determination of governments to
prevent a 1987-style crash ``gives underlying support for the
market, so I wouldn't get overexcited'' about the danger of a full
crash.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve was reported ready to move large
amounts of cash into the American banking system if money was
needed to prevent a financial crisis. An option would be to lower
interest rates.
   But that was not seen as a choice for Britain, because of its
7.6 percent inflation rate. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson last week raised base lending rates to an eight-year high of
15 percent to control inflation.

<HEAD>California Initiative Proposed; Rally in New Jersey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands demonstrated their support of abortion rights in New
Jersey and in California, where the state attorney general
announced he would sponsor a ballot initiative to protect a woman's
right to have an abortion.
   In Trenton, N.J., several thousand pro-choice demonstrators
chanted, waved banners and marched on the Statehouse on Sunday to
urge lawmakers not to change laws that allow abortion.
   The battle over abortion has heated up nationwide since the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a ruling in July broadening states' rights to
restrict abortion, and the issue figures in the New Jersey
governor's race.
   Eleanor Smeal, former president of the National Organization for
Women, urged the demonstrators in Trenton to use the election to
send a message to the rest of the country.
   ``It's a political fight, it's a medical fight and it's a public
health fight,'' Ms. Smeal said.
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio opposes any new
restrictions on abortion. James Courter, the GOP candidate, has a
long anti-abortion voting record, but in recent weeks has said he
wouldn't impose his personal views on New Jersey women.
   State police estimated the crowd at 6,500; organizers claimed
10,000.
   In San Francisco, a crowd estimated by police at 30,000 marched
down Market Street on Sunday, carrying signs and chanting their
support for abortion rights.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, sporting a
``Choice'' button, told the crowd he would sponsor a ballot
initiative to protect abortion rights.
   As in New Jersey, the issue is becoming a matter of
gubernatorial politics.
   The ballot measure proposed by Van de Kamp, one of three
Democratic hopefuls in the 1990 governor's race. If the measure
attracts enough signatures it will appear on the ballot in November
1990.
   The measure is designed to negate a provision of a crime
initiative that will appear on the ballot in June that is sponsored
by Sen. Pete Wilson, the expected Republican candidate for
governor, and local prosecutors.
   The Wilson-backed measure would repeal a wide range of state
constitutional rights in criminal cases, including the right to
privacy.
   Van de Kamp, backed by several constitutional scholars and major
abortion-rights groups, contends the initiative could lead to
criminal prosecution for some abortions. That is because abortion
rights in California are based on the state constitutional right of
privacy.

   Rescue divers watched helplessly from the
ocean's surface as a 12-foot shark fed on the body of a scuba diver
who had failed to return from an outing the night before.
   Acting fire department Capt. Aaron Young said he ordered his men
out of the water Sunday when he determined there was no safe way to
reach the body while the shark continued feeding.
   ``I decided it was not worth the risk to put fire personnel into
the water in a situation that involved a recovery and not a
rescue,'' Young said.
   ``There is no way we could find out if he got into trouble and
he died or if he initially was attacked by sharks,'' he said.
   Young said the divers later recovered a small part of the man's
body and his dive equipment. The 33-year-old man's name was not
immediately disclosed, pending notification of his family.
   He had gone diving with three companions Saturday evening, but
failed to return to shore, officials said. A search Saturday night
was suspended and resumed about 9 a.m. Sunday, Young said.
   About an hour after the body was located, lifeguards on shore
spotted a large school of tiger sharks, some as big as 15 feet, in
the area and warned people to stay out of the water, said Capt.
Joseph Mills of the city's Water Safety Office.
   The body was located in 15 feet of water about 400 yards
offshore of Kahe Point, about 30 miles from Honolulu. The area is
known for shark sightings, Young said.

<HEAD>Investigation Under Way Into Fatal Air Force Fighter Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force investigators studied the
wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet today to determine what caused it
to turn upside down and slam into the ground, killing the two men
aboard.
   The jet, which had been on a training mission, went down Sunday
morning at Carswell Air Force Base, said a base spokesman.
   The fighter crashed just 200 feet from ``Bomber Row,'' a section
of the airfield's taxiway where about 10 B-52s were parked. Three
of them were slightly damaged.
   The victims were identified as the pilot, Reserve Maj. Robert M.
Tucker, 37, of Roanoke, Texas, and Marine Corps Capt. James T.
Bourne, 33, of Dallas, officials said.
   The crash site was restricted because of fuel that had spilled
and because of unspent ammunition that was aboard the aircraft,
said 1st Lt. Stephen Norton, a base spokesman.
   Officials said the jet was making a simulated attack run on the
base when the crash occurred. Witnesses said the fighter was 200 to
300 feet high when it listed to its right, turned upside down and
slammed into the ground.
   The jet was assigned to the 944th Tactical Fighter group, Air
Force Reserve, stationed at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, said
Luke AFB spokesman Capt. Joe Davis.
   The $20 million aircraft was en route from Dallas Naval Air
Station to Carswell on a training mission when it crashed, Norton
said.
   Col. John Sams Jr., the base commander, said it could take eight
to 12 months to determine the cause of the crash.
   Sunday's fatal crash followed by two days the crash of an Air
Force RF-4C jet that went down in a pasture near Bangs, Texas,
killing one of its two crewman. The RF-4C was stationed at
Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, about 150 miles from Bangs in
central Texas.

<TEXT>
   Fan blade fragments probably severed the
hydraulic controls of a DC-10 this summer, crippling the aircraft
and causing it to plunge to the ground in a fiery crash, officials
said.
   General Electric Co. flight saftey investigator Jerry Clark
speculated about the cause of the crash Sunday night after more
than 100 volunteers swept farm fields in northwestern Iowa looking
for the missing parts from the No. 2 engine of United flight 232.
   The July 19 crash at the Sioux Gateway Airport _ 60 miles from
here _ killed 112 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``It is much more likely that the hydraulic lines were hit by
fan belt blade fragments than fan disc fragments,'' Clark said in a
telephone interview.
   Federal investigators are not sure whether the fan disk that has
already been recovered will solve the mystery.
   ``We won't know that until we analyze it, but we want to recover
everything that is out there,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman
for the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Searchers on Sunday found a sheared off bolt buried 3 inches in
the ground of a field near Alta. On Saturday, searchers found a
part of a fan blade sticking out of the ground in a nearby field.
   The search was financed by GE, which made the plane's engine in
1972.
   Alta-area farmer Janice Sorenson earned a $119,000 reward for
finding about two-thirds of the rear engine fan disc while
harvesting corn on her farm last Tuesday. The remainder of the disk
was found Thursday on the nearby farm of Harold Halverson, who will
collect about $40,000.
   GE paid $1,000 each for the bolt and fan blade fragment
discovered this weekend. An equal payment of $1,000 was made to the
metal detector clubs that found the parts and the owners of the
land, Nick Droegmiller and Dale Sorenson.
   ``The important thing is to try to get as much of the rotating
parts of the engine back to Cincinnati (where GE makes engines) so
we can understand the complete failure sequence,'' said Clark.
   The engine broke apart north of Alta, cutting parts of hydraulic
lines that controlled the flight of the jumbo jet. Pilots were able
to guide the craft erratically to Sioux City, but the plane crashed
in flames on landing.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danilo Kis, a Yugoslav-born writer and essayist
whose works blended fact and fiction to describe the horror of the
Holocaust and Stalin's forced labor camps, has died of cancer,
friends said today. He was 54.
   Kis, who lived in Paris for the past 10 years, died Sunday, they
said.
   Kis was born in 1935 in Subotica, on Yugoslavia's border with
Hungary. He studied comparative literature and then began his
literary career translating the works of Charles Baudelaire, Paul
Verlaine, Pierre Corneille and Raymond Queneau, among others, into
his native Serbo-Croatian.
   He found a sympathetic and enthusiastic audience in France.
   His novels include ``Jardin, Cendre (Garden, Ashes)'' (1971),
``Un Tombeau Pour Boris Davidovitch (A Tomb For Boris
Davidovitch)'' (1980), ``Sablier (Hourglass)'' (1982), and
``Chagrins Precoces (Early Sadness)'' (1984). His best-known
collection of short stories, ``Encyclopedie des Morts (Encycolpedia
of the Dead),'' was published in 1985.
   ``Who would know how to separate dream from reality, day from
night, night from dawn ... the joy of love and the sadness of
memories,'' he wrote in ``Encyclopedie des Morts.''
   In 1980 he received the Grand Aigle d'Or literary prize from the
city of Nice for his life's work.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Pennsylvania DWI Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the drunken-driving conviction of a Pennsylvania man
who was videotaped answering police questions about his height,
weight and color of his eyes.
   The court said it will decide whether police violated the
motorist's rights when they videotaped his responses before warning
him of his right to remain silent or have a lawyer present.
   Inocencio Muniz first was questioned by Upper Allen Township
Patrolman David Spotts, who noticed Muniz's car stopped by the side
of the road Nov. 30, 1986, with the engine running.
   The patrolman said he smelled alcohol on Muniz's breath, and
noticed that his eyes were glazed and bloodshot. Spotts said he
told Muniz not to drive until he was in a condition to operate the
car safely, but Muniz drove off as the officer returned to his
patrol car.
   Spotts pursued Muniz, ordered him to stop and told him to
perform some sobriety tests, which he failed. The officer said he
then took Muniz to a police station where the motorist was
videotaped answering questions about his height, weight, eye color
and other personal characteristics.
   Only after those responses was Muniz given so-called Miranda
warnings about his rights.
   Muniz, convicted previously of drunken driving, was convicted
again and sentenced to a prison term of 45 days to 23 months.
   A Pennsylvania appeals court threw out the conviction last year.
It said, ``Any testimonial or communicative statements elicited
from Muniz following his arrest and before he received his Miranda
warnings should have been suppressed for trial purposes unless he
effectuated a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his
rights.''
   The statistical questions Muniz was asked were designed to
reveal his thought processes, and Muniz's ``confusion and failure
to speak clearly indicated a state of drunkenness,'' the state
court said.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Muniz, 89-213.

<HEAD>Regional Communist Leaders Reportedly Urge Ouster of Honecker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's regional Communist Party leaders
have urged a sweeping reshuffle of the ruling Politburo and the
ouster of hard-line leader Erich Honecker, a West German newspaper
reported today.
   Also today, the government's labor chief warned of growing
tension among the nation's work force. Opposition activists planned
a mass protest in Leipzig tonight to press for democratic reforms.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper, quoting what it called
``well- informed'' sources in East Berlin, said 13 of the 15
regional Communist Party chiefs are demanding dramatic changes in
leadership as well as an easing of the nation's hard-line policies.
   Bild said the demand for Honecker's ouster and the reshuffling
of the Polituro comes ``because they (the regional Communist
chiefs) fear that strikes and unrest will break out all across the
nation.''
   According to Bild, the regional chiefs are demanding that the
government enter into talks with opposition groups, loosen travel
restrictions to the West and hold free elections with independent
candidates.
   Bild is owned by the conservative Springer publishing group,
which has been at odds with East Germany's leadership for decades.
   Honecker's hard-line stance has come under increasing criticism
at home.
   Party sources have said leaders in East Berlin are unhappy over
the way Honecker, Communist Party chief since 1971, has handled the
current unrest in the country and that he has lost support in the
163-seat Central Committee.
   ``I can say openly that the climate among the workers is
tense,'' said Harry Tisch, a member of the ruling Politburo who
oversees the nation's nearly 8.6 million workers.
   In an interview with the state-run newspaper newspaper Junge
Welt, Tisch said Communist leaders must respond to complaints from
workers ``or others will'' _ an apparent reference to the nation's
growing opposition movement.
   Despite official warnings against street protests, opposition
activists plan to demonstrate tonight in Leipzig to press demands
for democratic reforms.
   More than 70,000 people joined in a pro-democracy march in
Leipzig last Monday, the largest single protest in nearly four
decades.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans have taken to the streets in
recent weeks to demand reforms in the largest protests since a 1953
uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   More than 52,000 East Germans have fled West since Sept. 10 from
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Some 70,000 more have been
allowed to emigrate legally so far this year, or have refused to
return to their homeland.

<HEAD>Growth in Business Sales Far Outstrips Inventory Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose 0.3 percent in
August, but business sales gained a hefty 3.1 percent, the
government reported today.
   The combination of sales advancing far faster than the
accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots normally is good news
for the economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it
could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
   The Commerce Department said inventories climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $789.9 billion in August, following a gain of 0.9 percent
in July.
   Business sales, meanwhile, rose to a seasonally adjusted $526.8
billion after dropping 0.9 percent in July.
   The August business activity produced a decrease in the ratio of
inventories to sales. It was 1.50, meaning it would take one and
one-half months to exhaust inventories at the August pace. The
ratio stood at 1.54 in July.
   The business picture could have continued to improve last month.
The Commerce Department reported last week that September retail
sales were up a moderate 0.5 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in
August.
   Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of
the total, rose 0.3 percent while retailers' backlogs increased 0.7
percent. Wholesalers registered a 0.1 drop.
   Overall inventories were 7.1 percent above those of a year ago.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, rose 5.6 percent.
Retailers' sales were up 0.7 percent and wholesalers' 1.5 percent.
   Total sales were up 7.1 percent from August 1988.

<TEXT>
   The first of more than 1,300 East German
refugees here renounced their citizenship today and received
special permits allowing them to join thousands of their countrymen
who have fled to the West.
   ``We are free,'' read a hand-lettered banner unfurled as the
cheering refugees emerged from the East German Embassy.
   Even as preparations were made for the departures, several dozen
more refugees arrived today seeking help at the West German
Embassy. Diplomatic sources said 200 to 300 new refugees were taken
in over the weekend.
   The first group of a dozen refugees, mainly mothers and
children, arrived for processing at the East German Embassy from a
holiday camp outside Warsaw.
   They first signed a form labeled ``Request for release from
citzenship of the German Democratic Republic.'' Then they were
given a new identity card allowing them to leave the country and
were taken to the West German compound.
   Checks also were made for any criminal background, East German
Ambassador Juergen Van Zwoll said.
   The East Germans will be allowed to go to the country of their
choice without crossing their Communist homeland, said Falko
Schreiber, press attache of the East German Embassy. The
arrangement was announced Saturday.
   A West German official said it was possible some refugees could
leave as early as this afternoon, but that was unlikely because
transport arrangements had not been completed.
   The West German government, which will pay to get the refugees
to the West, contacted LOT Polish Airlines to discuss possible
arrangements but no flights were confirmed, said Jacek Jaworksi of
the LOT charter department.
   The West German Embassy here is having difficulty finding room
for the increasing number of refugees. Its staff, taxed by two
months of handling the refugees, is being augmented by officials
flown in from Bonn to help with the complex housing and
transportation arrangements and the issuing of new citizenship
papers.
   A West German diplomat overseeing the refugee situation said a
better solution must be found.
   ``At this rate, this thing could take a half a year with more of
them coming in,'' he said.
   There was no indication of any time limit to the exit permits
agreed to by Communist East Berlin, which has been shaken in recent
months by the exodus of thousands of its citizens and widespread
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   ``The action will last as long it is necessary,'' Schreiber said.
   Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said the
agreement ``has no term'' and Poland may be a transit point for
more refugees for some time to come.
   ``It looks that we may have to deal with it for a long period of
time,'' he said. ``It will all depend on the situation in East
Germany.''
   The exodus grew elsewhere over the weekend, as more than 3,800
East Germans escaped West through Hungary.
   More than 52,000 East Germans have flooded into West Germany
since Sept. 10 from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Some 70,000
more have been allowed to emigrate legally so far this year, or
have refused to return to their homeland.

<HEAD>LaRouche-Linked Committee Loses Appeal, Faces Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political action committee linked to fringe
presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche lost a Supreme Court appeal
today, and now faces having to pay $2.7 million in
contempt-of-court fines.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the National
Democratic Policy Committee's challenge to fines stemming from a
federal mail fraud and conspiracy prosecution.
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year prison sentence after being
convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than
$30 million in defaulted loans, 11 counts of actual mail fraud
involving $294,000 in defaulted loans, and one count of conspiring
to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
   Four organizations associated with LaRouche _ Caucus
Distributors, Campaigner Publications, Fusion Energy Foundation and
the National Democratic Policy Committee _ were cited for contempt
in connection with a grand jury investigation of him.
   U.S. District Judge P. David Mazzone in Boston ruled that the
organizations had failed to comply with subpoenas ordering release
of all fundraising records.
   Mazzone originally imposed $6.55 million in fines against Caucus
Distributors, based in Leesburg, Va., and $5.1 million fines
against each of the three other organizations.
   The amounts were set aside by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, and Mazzone was ordered to recalculate the fines.
   Last Sept. 13, the judge ordered Caucus Distributors to pay $2.6
million and the three other organizations to pay $2.7 million each.
   The appeal acted on today was filed last August, before
Mazzone's latest action. The appeal was filed in behalf of the
National Democratic Policy Committee only.
   Peter Gelhaar, a federal prosecutor in Boston, said denial of
Supreme Court review would clear the way for payment of the
contempt fines.
   ``We're going to go forward vigorously to collect these fines,''
he said in an interview.
   The case is National Democratic Policy Committee vs. U.S.,
89-320.

<TEXT>
   Hockey's Wayne Gretzky made good on his
nickname, ``The Great One,'' by slamming in his 1,851st point to
make him the National Hockey League's all-time leading scorer.
   Gretzky erased Gordie Howe's record of 1,850 points with two
goals and an assist Sunday in leading the Los Angeles Kings to a
5-4 overtime victory over the Edmonton Oilers, his former team.
   Howe earned his 1,850 points over 26 seasons. Gretzky beat his
record during his 11th season.
   The sellout crowd of 17,503 in the Northlands Coliseum, many of
whom walked by Gretzky's statue on the way in, roared and roared.
But Gretzky almost didn't make it through the game.
   ``I almost didn't play the third period,'' said Gretzky, who
complained of dizziness. ``I got my bell rung a couple of times.''
   When he made the second record-setting point, Gretzky leaped
into the air and was surounded by his teammates. The crowd gave him
an ovation that lasted more than two minutes.
   The game was stopped as Howe, NHL president John Ziegler and
Mark Messier, who succeeded Gretzky as captain of the Oilers,
presented him with gifts marking the occasion, including a diamond
bracelet containing 1.851 carats.
   ``An award such as this takes a lot of help,'' Gretzky told the
crowd. ``Both teams that are here today are a big part of these
1,800 points.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to free Pan
American World Airways from having to pay $951,500 plus interest to
two families of 1974 crash victims.
   The justices, without comment, left intact the awards stemming
from the April 22, 1974, crash in Indonesia of a Pan Am plane
flying from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. All 96 passengers and 11 crew
members died in the accident.
   Lawyers for Pan Am say the airline's liability should not have
exceeded $75,000 per victim.
   Numerous lawsuits were filed after the crash, and all but three
cases were settled. The unsettled suits centered on the deaths of
John and Virginia Causey of West Point, Va., and John W. Ryder,
identified in court documents as a citizen of Australia.
   Treaties set the $75,000-per-passenger liability limit for
deaths in international flight crashes. But the Causey and Ryder
families contended that the limit should not apply because Pan Am
had been guilty of willful misconduct.
   A federal jury in California concluded that the airline had
committed willful misconduct by entrusting the flight to an
incompetent pilot.
   The Causey family was awarded $300,000 in damages; the Ryder
family $651,500.
   The awards were upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
last March 27.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Pan Am said a special
report compiled by the Federal Aviation Administration after its
investigation of the Pan Am crash in Indonesia and earlier
accidents wrongly was admitted as trial evidence.
   The case is Pan Am vs. Causey, 89-157.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a right-to-work group that sought to limit the power of unions to
collect dues from non-members.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments in an
Illinois case that the group was treated unfairly by a federal
appeals court.
   The justices also turned down a related appeal by the heirs to a
non-union worker who had opposed the way his dues were spent.
   The National Right to Work Legal Defense and Education
Foundation of Springfield, Va., said it was unfairly maligned in a
January ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court in that decision ruled against nine non-union
employees of Illinois state and local agencies.
   The workers had sued the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees (AFSME), accusing the union of using
non-members' dues to promote political and ideological causes.
   The 7th Circuit court upheld a federal judge's decision that
noted the union had agreed to refund any improper overcharges.
   What sparked the main appeal acted on today were references by
the 7th Circuit court to the role of the National Right to Work
Foundation.
   For example, the appeals court said the foundation was ``trying
to hamstring the union.''
   The foundation said it was not involved in the Illinois workers'
suit and sought vindication from the Supreme Court.
   AFSME, in urging the justices to reject the appeal, said a
foundation lawyer did represent the Illinois workers and that the
appeals court references to the group were proper.
   In the companion appeal, heirs to the late Jack Gilpin, one of
the non-union workers, asked the high court to throw out the 7th
Circuit court ruling.
   The cases are National right to Work Foundation vs. AFSME,
89-287, and Gilpin vs. AFSCME, 89-292.

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan Says Astrologer Was Reaction To Assassination Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan says she began consulting an
astrologer during her husband's years in the White House as a way
of dealing with the fear she felt after an assassination attempt on
the president.
   In her soon-to-be-published memoirs, Mrs. Reagan said her
consultation with astrologer Joan Quigley ``began as a crutch''
after Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 and was ``something I did to
hedge our bets, to try to keep Ronnie from getting shot again.''
   It eventually became ``an enormous embarrassment'' to Reagan
when it was revealed to the news media.
   The book, ``My Turn: The Memoirs of Nancy Reagan,'' written with
ghostwriter William Novak, is excerpted in the Oct. 23 issue of
Newsweek magazine. It will be published later this month by Random
House.
   She said she started talking to Quigley after entertainer Merv
Griffin told her Quigley had predicted ahead of time that the day
Reagan was shot would be a dangerous day for him. She called her
sessions with Quigley ``helpful and comforting'' and likened her to
a therapist.
   In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' program,
Mrs. Reagan confirmed that her astrologer advised her on dates for
presidential trips and news conferences.
   ``She ... would pick out dates that were good or bad,'' Mrs.
Reagan said of her husband's planned trips.
   ``If it was ... if he were going, say to Chicago, and, and I
would say to her, `Gee, is it better if he leaves in the morning or
the afternoon?' Or maybe the night before. And she'd tell me. I
didn't see anything wrong with that.''
   Mrs. Reagan said the same was true with news conferences, but no
political decisions were ever based on astrology.
   The president learned she was talking to an astrologer when he
overheard a conversation with Quigley on the telephone, she wrote.
``If it makes you feel better, go ahead and do it,'' she quotes him
as saying. ``But be careful. It might look a little odd if it ever
came out.''
   In the interview, the former first lady said she is no longer
consulting Quigley or any astrologer.
   Mrs. Reagan wrote that the biggest mistake of her husband's
presidency was allowing Donald Regan and James A. Baker III to
switch jobs in January 1985.
   In the book, she sharply criticized Regan, who moved from
Treasury secretary to White House chief of staff in the job swap,
and said he ``often acted as if he were president.''
   She denied she engineered Regan's departure from the White
House, but detailed her role in making her husband aware of growing
complaints about him at the height of the Iran-Contra affair.
   In an interview Wednesday that was broadcast Sunday on the
Associated Press Radio Network, Mrs. Reagan said the book was not
intended as an attempt to get even for slights she suffered during
the White House years.
   ``I hope it doesn't read that way,'' she said in on the AP
Network program ``Newsweek on Air.'' ``I tried very hard not to be
vindictive.''
   Mrs. Reagan said all she wanted to do was ``set the record
straight about a lot of things that had not been straight during
the White House years.''
   The book renders harsh judgment on several other top officials
of the Reagan administration. Reagan's first secretary of state,
Alexander Haig, was ``Ronnie's biggest mistake in the first term,''
she says, calling him ``power hungry,'' ``belligerent,'' and
``obsessed with matters of status.''
   She called former budget director David Stockman ``a shrewd and
crafty man'' who violated the president's trust.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, by waiting far too long
to resign after getting into trouble over finances, ``weakened both
the Justice Department and the presidency,'' she wrote.
   Mrs. Reagan said she thinks the press made too much of her
supposed feud with Soviet first lady Raisa Gorbachev, but admitted
she didn't like her, saying Mrs. Gorbachev ``struck me as a woman
who expected to be deferred to.''
   ``My fundamental impression of Raisa Gorbachev was that she
never stopped talking. Or lecturing, to be more accurate.''

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded early today near the
offices of a newspaper in the city of Bucaramanga, killing two of
the paper's workers and injuring at least seven others, police said.
   The director of the Vanguardia Liberal newspaper said in a live
radio broadcast that drug traffickers were responsible for the
bomb, which exploded in a car parked near the offices and was
packed with up to 130 pounds of dynamite.
   The newspaper is the main daily in Bucaramanga, 175 miles north
of Bogota.
   ``Although I can't identify the perpetrators, I can say that
basically they are the same group of drug traffickers that have
carried out these types of attacks in the past,'' Alejandro Galvis
Ramirez said on the national radio chain Caracol.
   The blast killed a night watchman and a maintenance worker at
the paper's downtown offices, a Bucaramanga police spokesman said
in a telephone interview.
   It injured another seven people and caused extensive damage, the
spokesman said. He added that 15 houses nearby were affected, and
three of them were almost completely destroyed.
   Police initially estimated the damage caused by the explosion at
$1.2 million. ``The area is a mess,'' the spokesman said.
   The attack is the second major bombing of a Colombian newspaper
since the government began a crackdown on drug traffickers Aug. 19.
   On Sept. 2, the main offices of Bogota's El Espectador newspaper
were targeted in a car bomb attack that injured 83 people.
Journalists at the paper blamed the attack on drug lords angered by
the paper's hard line on traffickers.
   Galvis Ramirez said he did not know if the Vanguradia would be
able to continue publishing in the city of 400,000 people.
   ``We don't yet know if the machines are still functioning or
even if we have electricity,'' he said.
   Another police officer, Col. Jorge Ernesto Ferrero, said on the
radio that some of the injured were workers at the paper while
others were passing by when the bomb, placed in a Renault, exploded.
   He said police had made no arrests in connection with the blast.
   On Sunday, the visiting director of the U.S. Information Agency
said international publishers pledged $1 million in donations to
the Bogota newspaper El Espectador, which also has been battered by
a terrorist campaign blamed on traffickers.
   Also Sunday, authorities captured a man convicted of drug
trafficking charges in New York and seized an alleged accountant
for one of Colombia's powerful drug lords, news reports said.
   Police arrested Victor Eduardo Mera Mosquera, 36, at his
apartment Friday in the southern city of Cali, according to reports
in the daily El Tiempo and in El Espectador.
   He was arrested in New York in February 1984 and charged with
taking part in a drug ring operating in New York, Florida, Texas,
California and Arizona, El Tiempo reported.
   El Espectador said Mera Mosquera was freed from a Manhattan jail
because of a ``bureaucratic error'' but was later convicted in
absentia. It did not elaborate.
   The paper reported that he was arrested again in Bogota in 1986
but was released months later by a judge who ruled authorities had
not completed the paperwork for his extradition to the United
States in the time alloted by the law.
   Spokesmen for the national and local police in Cali said they
could not confirm Mera Mosquera's arrest or details about him. The
U.S. Embassy in Bogota says it cannot comment on specific
extradition cases.
   In a raid Saturday on a Bogota apartment, police captured Tulia
Consuelo Rincon Barrera, 35, whom they said was an accountant for
Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the three leaders of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, El Espectador reported.
   The woman maintains she never met the Medellin cartel leader and
only filled out income tax forms for one of his reputed underlings,
Leonardo Vargas Vargas, who was arrested last week, El Espectador
said.
   President Virgilio Barco announced his war on drugs after the
assassination Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate and an anti-drug crusader. Barco said he
would seize the property of drug traffickers and extradite reputed
narcotics figures to the United States.

<HEAD>Court Backs Out of Deciding IRS Issue on Inheritance Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today backed out of deciding
whether the Internal Revenue Service, when assessing inheritance
taxes, may challenge deductions state courts have allowed for legal
fees and executor's commission.
   The justices agreed last February to decide the issue in an
appeal by a New York lawyer who acted as executor and attorney for
a $450,000 estate.
   In a brief announcement today, the court said without further
explanation that the appeal had been ``improvidently granted.''
   The court voted, 8-1, to dismiss the case. Justice Byron R.
White dissented.
   The justices' action has the effect of permitting an IRS
subpoena of the files of James M. White, a Rochester attorney who
handled the will of Helen P. Smith after she died in November 1982.
   A state judge who presided over enforcement of the will, a
procedure known as probate, ruled in 1984 that White should be paid
$16,800 for his legal services and $17,548 as an executor's
commission.
   White deducted those amounts when calculating the federal tax
owed by the estate.
   The IRS said White must provide records to justify the
deductions. The lawyer refused to comply, contending the amount of
time he spent handling the settling of the will and the hourly
rates he charged did not bear on whether the fees were reasonable
under New York law.
   A federal judge ruled that the IRS failed to show its
investigation of the case is reasonable. The judge said the IRS did
not demonstrate any reason to suspect ``fraud, overreaching or
excessiveness'' by White to justify inspecting his records.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the federal
judge's decision and said White must provide the documents even
though there is no claim he acted improperly.
   The IRS has the authority to require the information in its
investigation of the tax liability of the Smith estate, the appeals
court said.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, White said, ``No federal
interest is served by permitting the Internal Revenue Service or
the federal court to redetermine the reasonableness of an
attorney's fee that has already been considered and approved by a
state probate court.''
   The case is White vs. U.S., 88-928.

   The leader of a national abortion rights group
said today it will consider removing Connecticut Gov. William A.
O'Neill from a list of top political targets for defeat next year
if he will agree not to push his anti-abortion views.
   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said she was contacted by O'Neill's staff over the weekend
and was trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the
governor.
   His selection to the group's ``NARAL Nine'' drew expressions of
surprise and regret from some Connecticut pro-choice leaders when
it was announced Saturday.
   ``If I get some assurance from him that he will in fact
represent the views of his constitutents and not introduce
legislation and not sign legislation (restricting access to
abortions), then we may remove him from the list,'' Michelman said.
``I have to talk to the governor.''
   Others on the target list include North Carolina Sen. Jesse
Helms and Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, both Republicans, as well as
state legislators and likely candidates for governorships or the
Senate in 1990. O'Neill was one of only two Democrats on the list.
   Michelman said officials of the group's Connecticut affiliate
asked NARAL to reconsider O'Neill's inclusion on the list of
priority targets. O'Neill may seek re-election next year.
   O`Neill spokesman John Sandberg called the listing ``bizarre''
and said the Connecticut governor has not supported failed attempts
in the state's legislature to cut off Medicaid funding for
abortions.
   Lynn Blackwell, president of the board of the Connecticut NARAL
group, said O'Neill ``is not an active anti-choice politician. He's
never used his power, his considerable power, to advance his
personal opinion on abortion.''
   Michelman acknowledged that O'Neill has not used his influence
as governor to oppose abortion rights. But, she said, ``He is an
anti-choice governor _ there's no question.''
   Michelman and abortion-rights supporters in Congress, meanwhile,
voiced opposition to any attempts to compromise with opponents in
an attempt to head off a possible presidential veto of legislation
that would expand federal Medicaid funding for abortions for poor
women who are victims of rape or incest.
   ``We're not interested in any compromise,'' said Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., a supporter of abortion rights.
   President Bush said Friday he was looking for ``flexibility''
and awaiting the outcome of negotiations in Congress on the
legislation, which passed the House last week and goes back to the
Senate, where it has already been passed, for agreement on another
provision.
   Packwood said Bush appeared to be seeking the addition of
language allowing the Medicaid abortions only when the rape or
incest was reported within 48 hours of the occurrence. As passed by
th House the bill requires the event be reported ``promptly.''
   Michelman commented as abortion-rights activists from around the
country presented members of Congress with what they said were
petitions bearing 1 million signatures stating opposition to ``any
attempt to interfere with the fundamental right of a woman to make
her own decision about abortion.''
   The activists gave the petitions to Packwood and Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., then spread out around Capitol Hill to take
their message to other congressmen.

<HEAD>California Initiative Proposed; Rally in New Jersey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands demonstrated their support of abortion rights in New
Jersey and in California, where the state attorney general
announced he would sponsor a ballot initiative to protect a woman's
right to have an abortion.
   In Trenton, N.J., several thousand pro-choice demonstrators
chanted, waved banners and marched on the Statehouse on Sunday to
urge lawmakers not to change laws that allow abortion.
   The battle over abortion has heated up nationwide since the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a ruling in July broadening states' rights to
restrict abortion, and the issue figures in the New Jersey
governor's race.
   Eleanor Smeal, former president of the National Organization for
Women, urged the demonstrators in Trenton to use the election to
send a message to the rest of the country.
   ``It's a political fight, it's a medical fight and it's a public
health fight,'' Ms. Smeal said.
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio opposes any new
restrictions on abortion. James Courter, the GOP candidate, has a
long anti-abortion voting record, but in recent weeks has said he
wouldn't impose his personal views on New Jersey women.
   State police estimated the crowd at 6,500; organizers claimed
10,000.
   In San Francisco, a crowd estimated by police at 30,000 marched
down Market Street on Sunday, carrying signs and chanting their
support for abortion rights.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, sporting a
``Choice'' button, told the crowd he would sponsor a ballot
initiative to protect abortion rights.
   As in New Jersey, the issue is becoming a matter of
gubernatorial politics.
   The ballot measure proposed by Van de Kamp, one of three
Democratic hopefuls in the 1990 governor's race. If the measure
attracts enough signatures it will appear on the ballot in November
1990.
   The measure is designed to negate a provision of a crime
initiative that will appear on the ballot in June that is sponsored
by Sen. Pete Wilson, the expected Republican candidate for
governor, and local prosecutors.
   The Wilson-backed measure would repeal a wide range of state
constitutional rights in criminal cases, including the right to
privacy.
   Van de Kamp, backed by several constitutional scholars and major
abortion-rights groups, contends the initiative could lead to
criminal prosecution for some abortions. That is because abortion
rights in California are based on the state constitutional right of
privacy.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Jerry blustered ashore with 80
mph winds, flinging a half-dozen twisters inland, blacking out
thousands of homes and killing two people before quickly losing
much of its punch today.
   A voluntary evacuation order for thousands of people in the
low-lying southwestern corner of Louisiana was lifted today as the
remnants of the late-season storm moved away to the north through
eastern Texas.
   By 5 a.m. the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression with
winds at 35 mph. It was centered was 35 miles east-southeast of
Lufkin, near 31.2 degrees north latitude and 94.2 degrees west
longitude. It was moving northeast at 17 mph and was expected to
continue in that direction and weaken further.
   As the hurricane blew into Galveston from the Gulf of Mexico, it
uprooted trees, smashed windows and tore several balconies from an
apartment building. ``Whole balconies came down. It just ripped
them up from the bolts,'' said resident John Harsh.
   But damage overall was limited, with City Manager Doug Matthews
saying today that it is estimated to be less than $10 million. He
said also that there was no looting.
   The bodies of a 24-year-old man, who worked for the U.S. Coast
Guard, and his 2-year-old daughter were found on rock jetties on
Galveston Island's protective seawall, Galveston police said. It
appeared that they had been in a car that was swept off the
seawall, officers said.
   The seawall was erected after Galveston was devastated in a 1900
hurricane in which 6,000 or more people died. It was the deadliest
hurricane on record in the United States.
   A tornado spun off by Jerry damaged several buildings in the
town of Orange near the Louisiana line, and another twister ripped
the door off a Galveston fire truck and damaged the fire station
and a shed at the airport.
   Tornadoes or funnel clouds were sighted around Galveston Bay in
Hitchcock, Baytown, Beach City, Webster and a nearby spot northeast
of Texas Highway 6. Tornado damage generally was confined to roofs
and power lines.
   Two tornadoes were spotted early today in inland Polk County,
damaging some houses and barns, said sheriff's spokeswoman Genace
Chapman.
   At least 52,000 homes and businesses lost power, most of them in
Galveston Island, said Houston Lighting &amp; Power spokeswoman Graham
Painter. But by 5 a.m. today, 80 percent of the power was restored.
Phone service to much of the island also was disrupted.
   The center of the hurricane made landfall Sunday evening, with
sustained winds of 80 mph and 100 mph gusts, according to the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. Within 3{ hours,
Jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm after its maximum
sustained winds fell below 74 mph.
   On Galveston, which bore the brunt of the storm, an early
assessment found minor street flooding but little serious damage,
said Gary Vasquez of the emergency operations center. The biggest
task appeared to be cleaning up debris scattered by the wind, he
said.
   ``I think we did very well,'' said Mayor Jan Coggeshall.
   Schools were open as usual today, except for one elementary
school closed because of a power outage.
   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severe
possible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the Caribbean
and South Carolina last month, was a category 4 with winds of 135
mph. Jerry was much smaller, too, with hurricane-force winds
extending just 15 to 25 miles out from the eye, as compared with
100 miles for Hugo.
   But Jerry was still enough to cause fear in low-lying areas,
particularly because it coincided with an unusually high tide
caused by a rare alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. The
combination of astronomical forces and the storm sent tides 5 to 8
feet above normal.
   In Louisiana's Cameron Parish, officials Sunday urged voluntary
evacuation of 8,000 to 10,000 residents. ``We're just concerned
about getting people to higher ground,'' said Scott Henry, a Civil
Defense volunteer.
   The evacuation advisory was lifted this morning.
   Earlier, hundreds of workers had been evacuated from offshore
oil rigs as Jerry zigzagged through the gulf during the weekend.
   Most of Galveston's 62,000 residents decided to stay in their
homes instead of evacuating for Jerry.
   By 11 p.m., those who had moved to shelters were told they could
return home, said Gary Stone, spokesman for Galveston's Emergency
Operations Center.
   Jerry was the seventh hurricane of the six-month Atlantic
season, which ends in November. Hugo was easily the most
destructive, killing 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.
mainland and causing billions of dollars in damage.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Whether States May Use Federal Law to Break Up Mergers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states, and possibly private citizens, may use federal
antitrust law to break up corporate mergers.
   The court said it will hear arguments by California officials
seeking to scuttle the $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha
Beta supermarket chains.
   Today's action kept in effect an order issued by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor in August that blocks completion of the merger.
   Lucky, California's largest supermarket chain, and Alpha Beta,
the fourth largest, operate 550 stores between them.
   Alpha Beta's parent company, American Stores, acquired Lucky in
June 1988, intending to merge the two chains under the Lucky name.
   American Stores said California customers would save more than
$50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger.
But lawyers in the California attorney general's office said in a
lawsuit filed last year that a merger means less competition _
leading to $440 million in higher prices each year.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles temporarily
blocked completion of the merger, ordering continued separate
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had
occurred.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling in March.
   In effect, the appeals court said Attorney General John Van de
Kamp of California waited too long to sue.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Turned away an appeal by a political action committee linked
to fringe presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche. It now faces
having to pay $2.7 million in contempt-of-court fines.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the National
Democratic Policy Committee's challenge to fines stemming from a
federal mail fraud and conspiracy prosecution.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a right-to-work group that sought to
limit the power of unions to collect dues from non-members.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments in an
Illinois case that the group was treated unfairly by a federal
appeals court.
   _ Refused to free Pan American World Airways from having to pay
$951,500 plus interest to two families of 1974 crash victims.
   The justices, without comment, left intact the awards stemming
from the April 22, 1974, crash in Indonesia of a Pan Am plane
flying from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. All 96 passengers and 11 crew
members died in the accident.
   In the merger case, the appeals court said California officials,
if they had moved quickly enough, could prevent the merger. But the
appeals court said only the federal government, not states and
private citizens, has the power to break up mergers after financial
arrangements are completed.
   O'Connor's order in August had the effect of temporarily setting
aside the 9th Circuit court's ruling.
   The Federal Trade Commission temporarily blocked the merger last
year but later reached an agreement with the corporations allowing
the acquisition as long as certain conditions were met.
   Van de Kamp had been ordered to post a $16.3 million bond while
the state pursued its Supreme Court appeal but Kenyon later reduced
the amount to $10,000.
   In the state's appeal, Van de Kamp said the 9th Circuit court
ruling conflicts with rulings by federal appeals courts elsewhere.
   The case is California vs. American Stores, 89-258.

   A 7-year-old Massachusetts girl whose liver
transplant in 1982 helped shape the nation's organ transplant
policy remained hospitalized today after suffering a mysterious
bout of internal bleeding.
   Jamie Fiske was in stable condition at University of Minnesota
Hospital, officials said. It was the same hospital where she
received a liver transplant as an infant after he father, Charles
Fiske, made a dramatic televised appeal for her life.
   Jamie, of Bridgewater, Mass., left the hospital with her parents
Saturday after removal of her enlarged spleen on Oct. 9. She was to
stay one night at a hotel before returning home, but was readmitted
to the hospital at 5 a.m. Sunday with internal bleeding, said
hospital spokeswoman Mary Stanik.
   The bleeding had stopped today, but doctors did not know where
the bleeding came from and planned to conduct more tests, Stanik
said. She didn't know how long the child would be hospitalized.
   Jamie was admitted to the hospital Oct. 6 after suffering three
bouts of internal bleeding in a month. Her spleen, which doctors
said was seven or eight times the normal size for a child her age,
was removed and doctors believed that would end the bleeding.
   Exploratory surgery found no problems with Jamie's liver, said
her physician, Dr. John Najarian.
   When she received a liver as an infant, Jamie's case raised
questions about the procedures for determining who should receive
organ transplants and the propriety of awarding organs on the basis
of publicity campaigns. Partly as a result, the National Transplant
Act was passed to create a national computer system used to match
donors to recipients.
   Jamie was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition
in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, her
parents learned that only a liver transplant could save her life.
   She received a liver in 1982 a few days after Charles Fiske made
his appeal for a donor during a convention at the American Academy
of Pediatricians. Television networks showed him singing a line
from an old song, ``please don't take my sunshine away.''

   A federal magistrate today granted a
government request to order Frank Arnold Nesbitt, charged with
passing information to the Soviets, held without bond pending a
further court hearing.
   Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell agreed with Assistant U.S. Attorney
Deborah Young, who cited the severity of the charge and a risk that
Nesbitt, 44, might flee the country.
   Nesbitt was arrested Saturday at a hotel in nearby McLean, Va.,
and charged with communication and delivery and the attempt to
communicate and deliver unauthorized information to agents of the
Soviet government, according to a brief FBI statement.
   The affidavit supporting Nesbitt's arrest remained sealed today,
authorities said.
   Nesbitt told The Washington Post before he was arrested that he
tried to fool the KGB, did not tell Soviet agents anything useful
and wanted to be a double agent for the U.S. government. He said he
is a former Marine and Air Force communications officer.
   The Post said Nesbitt approached the paper Friday because he was
unhappy with the response he received from the FBI after he offered
his services as a spy following his return from an 11-day stay in
Moscow.
   At the hearing today, Nesbitt said he did not understand why he
was being kept in isolation at the Alexandria, Va., Adult Detention
Center. Sewell said it was the decision of the U.S. Marshal's
Service to determine how a suspect is to be kept.
   Sewell also told Nesbitt that a public defender would be
appointed, after the suspect said he had no money to hire his own
attorney.

   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets today
to disperse stone-throwing students outside a high school in Arab
east Jerusalem, and 15 students and five policemen were injured,
witnesses and officials said.
   Also today, an 8-year-old Palestinian boy died three days after
Israeli soldiers shot him during a demonstration in the occupied
Gaza Strip.
   Forty Palestinians were detained in the east Jerusalem
disturbance, which took place as thousands of religious Jews
visited Jerusalem for the eight-day Sukkot festival, police
spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   The unrest began when students from the Rashadiyeh High School
blocked roads with rocks and showered police with stones, witnesses
said. Paramilitary border police fired tear gas and rubber bullets
to disperse the crowd, they said.
   Sandori said five policemen were slightly injured from stones.
Officials at Mukassed Hospital in east Jerusalem said about 15
students were treated for tear-gas inhalation and bruises from
rubber bullets.
   Israel radio said police were investigating whether the riot was
sparked by the plans of militant Jews to lay a three-ton
cornerstone inside Jerusalem's Old City for what they hope will be
a rebuilt Jewish temple.
   The militants, who call themselves the Temple Mount Faithful,
want to rebuild the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
   But police prevented them from taking the cornerstone off a
truck and barred about 100 of the militants from going up to the
Temple Mount.
   The 35-acre Temple Mount site includes the spot where Moslems
believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven. The platform's two
mosques, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa, are the holiest Islamic
places of worship after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   The Gaza boy, who died in Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv,
was identified by the army as Qassem Abdallah Abu Lubda.
   He was shot Friday in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza when
soldiers opened fire on Palestinian stone-throwers, the army said.
The army said it was ``checking the circumstances of his injury.''
   Also today, Israeli tax collectors backed by soldiers raided at
least seven shops on the main square of Nablus, the largest town in
the occupied West Bank with 120,000 residents.
   An Arab reporter said the agents confiscated goods from the
stores and sealed some with red wax to prevent them from reopening
until taxes are paid. The shops specialize in shoes, clothes,
jewelry, photographs, and luggage.
   Israeli authorities have stepped up tax raids in recent weeks to
try to break a tax boycott called by the underground leaders of the
uprising.
   Boycotts and strikes have been the main economic weapons of the
uprising.
   Abu Lubda's death raised to 596 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis since the uprising began in December 1987. At
least 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have died in
the violence.

<HEAD>Ban on Use of Fetal Tissue for Research Reportedly Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to extend a
19-month-old ban on federal funding for research using fetal
tissue, The New York Times reported today.
   James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of
Health and Human Services, has recommended to HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan that the ban be continued over the objections of two
federal panels, the newspaper said.
   Sullivan was expected to act within a week, said the Times,
which cited no sources for its information.
   Spokesmen for Sullivan and Mason would say only today that issue
was under review in the department.
   Abortion opponents have strongly opposed using fetal tissue for
medical research, though scientists say transplanting fetal tissue
into adults may be effective in treating diabetes and Parkinson's
disease.
   HHS imposed the ban in March 1988 while the department reviewed
the issue. In December, two panels at the National Institutes of
Health studied the question and voted to recommend that the ban be
lifted.
   The Times quoted Robert Windom, assistant secretary for health
in the Reagan administration, as saying that he had been prepared
to approve fetal tissue experiments in January, but was instructed
by then-HHS Secretary Otis Bowen to leave the decision to the Bush
administration.

   The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy today he meant
only to tell the truth with his controversial autobiography in
which he says Martin Luther King Jr. had extramarital affairs.
   ``I held Martin Luther King in the highest regard,'' Abernathy
said at a news conference a week after news of the book made
headlines. ``He is my dearest friend, dead or unborn. I would do
nothing to harm Dr. King. I loved him dearly.''
   But Abernathy said King ``was not a Jesus, he was not a saint,
he was not an infallible person. I have told no lies.''
   In ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' published this month,
Abernathy wrote that King had difficulty resisting sexual
temptation. Abernathy, a King confidant, also wrote that the civil
rights leader spent parts of the night before his April 4, 1968,
assassination in Tennessee with two different women, and that he
then struck a third woman during an argument.
   Civil rights leaders, including former King colleagues Jesse
Jackson, Andrew Young and John Lewis, denounced the book last week
and demanded that Abernathy repudiate its statements. The said they
doubted he wrote the section about King's last night alive.
   In a statement issued to reporters today at his West Hunter
Street Baptist Church in Atlanta, Abernathy said his purpose in
writing the book was ``to focus attention once again on the civil
rights movement. ... I wanted to tell the truth and set the record
straight once and for all.''
   With King's private life already documented by historians, he
said he knew people would not believe his autobiography if he did
not tell the truth about King's infidelity.
   Abernathy said envy prompted fellow civil rights leaders to
denounce his autobiography.
   ``I think people are jealous of the fact that Ralph David
Abernathy has written a good-looking book and I was not supposed to
do that because they thought I was finished with the movement,''
Abernathy said Sunday.
   ``I may make some money for the first time in my life,''
Abernathy said. ``People are funny. ... I can name five or six
movement people who are now millionaires.''
   Black leaders also said in a statement that the revelations
about King's last night could rob Abernathy of his ``rightful place
in history.''
   Abernathy, 62, dismissed those suggestions after a service at
his church.
   ``You may be able to crop me out of a photo marching next to
Martin Luther King Jr.,'' he said, ``but you cannot take me out of
history, because I have earned my place.''
   The service took place with scarcely a hint of the controversy
generated by his autobiography and its passages on King's private
life.
   Abernathy, pastor of West Hunter Street Baptist Church, didn't
address his congregation. Instead, a guest minister preached in a
service honoring Abernathy on his 28th anniversary at the church.
   Several members of the congregation applauded when it was
announced that the book would soon be available at the church, and
that their pastor would autograph their copies.
   At Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was pastor, The Rev.
Joseph Roberts called on the congregation to boycott Abernathy's
book.
   The book already has gone into a second printing, adding 10,000
copies to the 30,000 copies ordered, according to Harper &amp; Row.

<HEAD>Court to Provide Guidelines for Penalizing Lawyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to provide some
guidelines for penalizing lawyers who file improper lawsuits.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a Washington, D.C., law
firm penalized $21,402 for filing an antitrust suit based on
inadequate research.
   The fine was ordered against Cooter &amp; Gell, which represented
Dash's Designer, a now-bankrupt discount men's clothing store.
   Dash's filed an antitrust suit against Hartmarx Corp.,
manufacturers and distributors of Hickey-Freeman and Hart,
Schaffner &amp; Marx men's clothing.
   Dash's said Hartmarx illegally sold the brands exclusively to
only one retailer in each of various major cities nationwide.
   Cooter &amp; Gell filed a second suit after a secretary at the law
firm telephoned some retailers in Washington and three other cities
to determine whether Hartmarx had such an exclusivity policy.
   Hartmarx later asked for dismissal of the Cooter &amp; Gell suit
after submitting affidavits that it distributed to as many as 20
different retailers in some markets.
   The law firm agreed to drop the suit.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ordered the $21,402
penalty against Cooter &amp; Gell last May.
   The appeals court said Cooter &amp; Gell ``claimed a nationwide
conspiracy ... after polling merchants in only four Eastern cities.
Cooter &amp; Gell had not made an inquiry reasonably commensurate with
the extent of their allegations.''
   The Supreme Court said today it will decide whether the appeals
court had authority to impose the fine after the lawsuit was
withdrawn voluntarily. The justices also will determine whether the
appeals court used the right test to decide the law firm acted
improperly.
   The case is Cooter &amp; Gell vs. Hartmarx Corp., 89-275.

<TEXT>
   Beijing's Communist Party embraced an orthodoxy
unheard of for a decade by demanding the ouster from its ranks of
wealthy private businessmen, whom it called exploiters.
   The decision to rid itself of the businessmen and other
``hostile and anti-party elements'' came during a meeting of the
capital chapter's Central Committee that ended Sunday.
   In another development, the government announced today that more
than 13,600 people have turned themselves in for embezzlement,
taking bribes and other economic crimes since August when the
government announced a 10-week leniency period.
   Official corruption had been one of the chief complaints
expressed by leaders of the pro-democracy campaign.
   Those who do not surrender will be severely punished, said
government prosecutor Zhang Siqing.
   During the gathering Sunday, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing
emphasized the need to carry on the ``class struggle'' against
party enemies.
   Li, an ideological hard-liner, said the party must ``rely on the
worker's class wholeheartedly'' and fight all who ``belittle and
deny the worker's position and role,'' the official Beijing Daily
reported today.
   The attack on private entrepreneurs and reference to class
struggle _ a concept largely ignored in the past 10 years of reform
_ were indications of the anti-liberal campaign's continued
momentum four months after troops crushed the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the Beijing party committee
demanded that all members in the city re-register in the coming
year as part of a drive to ``purify the party organizations.''
   ``A drive will be conducted to examine and investigate how party
members, especially officials with a party membership, behaved in
ending the national turmoil and quelling the anti-government
rioting,'' it said.
   The paper was referring to the spring student protests for
democratic reform, which the government ended with a military
assault that left hundreds of unarmed civilians dead.
   The report, which did not mention how many of Beijing's 10
million residents are party members, said only ``a very small
number of hostile and anti-party elements will be resolutely purged
from the party.''
   It indicated that private businessmen, called ``exploiters,''
will be a prime target.
   ``The resolution stipulated that exploiters cannot be admitted
into the party, and those who have already been party members must
adhere to the party's ideals,'' Xinhua said.
   ``Besides getting their own due pay, they should spend their
post-tax profits on production and public welfare and should not
use them for their own private needs. If they fail to do so, they
can no longer be party members.''
   Former capitalists faced constant persecution during the first
three decades of Communist rule. Over the past 10 years, however,
private businessmen have flourished under senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's economic reforms and his slogan of ``to get rich is
glorious.''
   But since the June crackdown on dissent and the ascendancy of
ideological hard-liners, the party has insisted there can be no
challenge to the socialist system. It has said that those people
allowed to do business on their own must be kept under close
surveillance.
   Some cities have put limits on how much private businessmen may
pay themselves, and tax collectors have been told to tighten their
monitoring of the 19 million privately employed in China.
   The Workers' Daily reminded readers last week that the abolition
of private property is the foundation of Marxist theory, and while
private ownership is tolerated today because of China's weak
economic base, the eventual goal remains to eliminate it.
   Party Secretary Li took a swipe at another stalled political
reform _ the separation of party and administrative functions _ by
saying the leadership of the party in the workplace must not be
denied.
   Party secretaries should respect managers and shouldn't ``take
over every administrative thing,'' but managers should accept party
control ``not as bondage but as an essential guarantee for well-run
socialist enterprises.''
   Former Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, ousted in June after
he was accused of supporting the students, is also charged with
weakening the party by calling for less intervention in daily
operations of government offices and factories.
   Li said China must ``sincerely uphold the party's leadership on
every front'' as the battles against infiltration, subversion and
``evolution'' toward capitalism reach new levels of intensity.

   A middle-aged Russian man described as the
first person granted a visa from the Soviet Union solely to visit
Elvis Presley's Graceland arrived in the United States _ wearing
blue suede shoes.
   ``I am ambassador of Russian rock 'n' roll,'' Kolya Vasin told
about 100 well-wishers when he arrived at Memphis International
Airport on Sunday night. ``For 30 years I love rock 'n' roll. I am
happy to be here today.''
   It was the first trip outside the Soviet Union for Vasin, 44,
whose visit was arranged by a British fan club. Traveling with 79
Elvis fans, mostly from Britain, he planned to visit Graceland,
home of the late King of rock 'n' roll, today.
   A spokesman for Graceland said managers of the estate, which
attracts more than 600,000 tourists a year, were not informed of
Vasin's visit and had not seen him by late morning.
   Previous visitors have included the Soviet ambassador to the
United States and a Soviet historian identified as a leading
scholar on rock 'n' roll, said Todd Morgan, a Graceland spokesman.
   ``We've had several people from Russia over the years. We've
always known there was a strong following over there,'' Morgan said
today. ``We're really tickled this guy is here. We wish we'd known.
We'd have done some kind of special welcome.''
   Vasin, a Leningrad resident who organizes rock concerts, said
official disapproval has left Soviet Elvis fans pretty much on
Lonely Street.
   ``Many, many people want more information about Elvis, but in
Russia is very little information about Elvis,'' he said in
accented English during a stopover in Boston. ``This is great
problem. There is a problem with black market and underground
information between people: no LPs, no books, no posters or any
information.''
   At a stop in London, Vasin added to his collection of Elvis
memorablilia.
   ``This is my dream on my feet,'' he said of his brightly colored
footgear. ``All my life I hear `Blue Suede Shoes' and I dream about
them.''
   The long-haired, bearded fan explained his infatuation with the
man who might be known in Moscow as The Czar: ``I listen to
`Jailhouse Rock' for the first time in 1958. After this shocking
moment, I love Elvis forever.''
   The visit, which some have called ``Presleynost,'' is being
sponsored by Elvisly Yours, a London Elvis fan club. According to
club president Sid Shaw, fans raised the $3,500 for Vasin's trip.
   Every year, Elvisly Yours pays for several handicapped children
to accompany the group to Graceland. Shaw, who has been to
Graceland 36 times, said he decided last year to find a Russian fan
to sponsor.
   The Soviet Embassy in London refused to help, but he finally
found an expert on Soviet rock 'n' roll at the BBC who told him
that Vasin was the biggest Elvis fan in the country.
   ``He's the Colonel Parker of the Soviet Union,'' proclaimed
Shaw, referring to Elvis' manager. ``He's a living legend in the
Soviet Union. He's the biggest rock 'n' roll fan.''
   Vasin, who left Moscow Oct. 7, said he had tried to get an exit
visa for a year with no luck. But the fan club arranged for an
American Elvis club, Suspicious Minds, to extend a formal
invitation to Vasin through Soviet authorities.
   During his 10-day visit, Vasin plans to visit Sun Records in
Memphis, where Elvis recorded, and Elvis' birthplace in Tupelo,
Miss.
   Vasin, who is single, said he arranges about five rock concerts
a year. He lives in one room in Leningrad, for which he pays 8
rubles ($12) a month.
   ``All I want is to love rock 'n' roll,'' said Vasin. ``I sit in
my very small room and listen to rock 'n' roll with my friends and
drink vodka.''
   His musical tastes are distinct.
   ``Number one is Elvis, number two the Beatles, there is zero for
the next numbers and then number eight is Little Richard and number
nine is the Rolling Stones and number 10 Bob Dylan.''

<HEAD>California Educator Named New Superintendent Of Troubled Chicago
Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California educator who survived several recall
attempts in wrestling control of a scandal-ridden school district
there is being named to head the nation's third-largest system, a
spokesman said.
   Ted Kimbrough, the former Los Angeles Unified School District
administrator, was to be officially appointed as head of Chicago's
public schools today at an afternoon meeting at the Chicago Board
of Education offices, said board spokesman Kenneth Masson.
   The Chicago system's woes _ gangs, a high dropout rate and poor
academic scores to name a few _ led former federal Education
Secretary William Bennett to call it the nation's worst in 1987.
   Public school enrollment totals 410,000.
   Kimbrough, 54, has had experience with troubled schools and
demonstrated his resilience as leader of the Compton, Calif.,
Unified School District.
   He took over leadership of the largely black district near Los
Angeles in 1982, a system plagued by gang-related activity that was
mired in a scandal over altered student test scores.
   Kimbrough demanded an investigation, reassigned 40 top
administrators and then survived several unsuccessful campaigns
seeking to force his removal.
   His appointment to head Chicago's schools, which are undergoing
a radical restructuring aimed at giving parents more say over local
schools, ends a nearly yearlong search for a replacement for former
Superintendent Manford Byrd Jr.
   Kimbrough, who is black, assumes leadership of a system in which
more than 60 percent of students are also black. He will be paid
$175,000 a year.
   The reform plan, passed by the state Legislature last year, is
being implemented for the first time this school year.
   It includes decentralizing the Board of Education by eliminating
hundreds of administrative jobs. A a key element of the reform plan
is the creation of 540 local parent-controlled councils assigned to
most of the district's schools.
   The councils, whose members were selected in citywide elections
last week, have the power to hire and fire principals, spend money
and draw up improvement plans for each school.

   Mother Teresa attended Mass on ck last month.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was released from the
Woodlands Nursing Home on Saturday.
   Mother Teresa's message, written in her distinctive hand, read:
   ``Kindly thank the people of the whole world and the Woodlands
people for all their prayers and tender love and care I have
received. God bless you. M. Teresa MC.''
   ``MC'' stands for the Missionaries of Charity, the order of
Roman Catholic nuns founded by the Yugoslav-born nun in 1950.
   ``Mother Teresa is much better today and progressing quite
steadily. She is quite radiant,'' said Sister Dorothy, who is
taking care of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   Sister Dorothy delivered Mother Teresa's note to a reporter who
had gone to the Missionaries of Charity home to inquire about her
recovery.
   Mother Teresa was staying with her fellow nuns, instead of the
order's headquarters, out of concern that too many visitors might
impede her recovery.
   Doctors have told Mother Teresa to restrict take it easy for the
next 10 days.
   ``She is doing some work and she's reading _ mostly prayer
books, but mostly she's in prayer,'' the nun added. ``Mother Teresa
feels that she has been healed because of the power of prayer.''
   Mother Teresa is eating her normal diet of porridge, bread and
jam in the morning and vegetable soup, boiled fish and fruit in the
afternoon.
   When Mother Teresa was released from the nursing home, her chief
physician, Ashim Bardhan, said she was still very weak and would
need to rest ``for quite some time.''
   Mother Teresa, whose order runs a home for the destitute and
dying in Calcutta and operates missions on six continents, was
hospitalized Sept. 5. She suffered a heart attack three days later
and developed recurring chest pains and a high fever that was
aggravated by infection.

   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization marked
its ninth World Food Day on Monday with calls to protect the
environment while using the Earth's resources to feed the poor.
   FAO Director-General Edouard Saouma said there is a
``fundamental paradox'' between providing enough food and
safeguarding the environment.
   In developed countries, pesticides and fertilizers have caused
pollution, while developing countries have abused natural resources
to feed a growing population, Saouma said. An estimated 27 million
acres of forest are cut down each year, leading to erosion, desert
formation, bad crops and famine, he said.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers cited the program his country
is trying out with Third World debtors as a possible way of
reversing environmental destruction: paying a portion of a
country's debts as an incentive for implementing environmental
protection measures.
   In a telegram, Pope John Paul II said he hopes ``the world
community preserves the riches of the Earth so that future
generations can live in dignity.''
   World Food Day was used to promote reforestation campaigns in
Nepal, Pakistan, Honduras, Barbados and Bangladesh and the use of
traditional, underexploited crops in East and West Africa.

   Former Industries Minister Cyril
Mathew, an ardent crusader for Sinhalese nationalism, died Monday
of a heart attack at the age of 77.
   Mathew was expelled from the Cabinet and the ruling United
National Party by President Junius R. Jayewardene in 1984 after
criticizing a conference called by Jayewardene to redress
grievances of the Tamil minority.
   Jayewardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, reinstated
Mathew's party membership six months ago and named his son, Nanda
Mathew, the minister for youth and sports.
   Cyril Mathew was best known for leading a vigorous campaign
among the Sinhalese majority to oppose Tamil separatism. He cited
archaeological and historical data in his effort to show Sri Lanka
was an invisible nation.
   He also wanted Sinhala to be the country's sole official
language and priority given to Buddhism, the religion of most
Sinhalese.
   Tamils, who have their own language and are mostly Hindus,
embarked on a separatist war in 1983 that has claimed the lives of
11,000 Tamils, Sinhalese, Moslems and Indian peacekeeping soldiers.

   Tropical Storm Dan killed 34 people and
injured 466 in central Vietnam last week as it devastated houses
and crops, the Vietnam News Agency said Monday.
   The storm hit the coastal province of Nghe Tinh on Friday,
whipping up tides that flooded more than 330,980 acres of rice
fields and destroyed about 51,000 houses, the news agency said.
   High waters washed away thousands of cattle and ruined 14,000
tons of food in the impoverished nation, which is plagued annually
by devastating storms.
   Casualties also were reported from a storm that struck two Red

   The U.S. Navy has called off its search for a
sailor who fell overboard while his ship was conducting exercises
near southern Japan, the military announced Monday.
   The search for Boatswain's Mate 3rd Class David M. Yanders, 24,
of Ripley, Tenn., was called off Friday, two days after he and
Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class David M. Bowman of McKinney, Texas, fell
overboard, the Navy said.
   Bowman was rescued shortly after falling early last Wednesday
from the frigate USS Downes, which was conducting exercises with
the Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific about 300 miles southwest of
Tokyo.
   Bowman was in stable condition Monday aboard the USS Tarawa,
where he was transferred for medical evaluation, the statement
said. Bowman's age was not given.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, said Master
Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for the U.S. Forces Japan. He said
weather conditions were listed as poor and visibility was limited
when the two fell overboard.

<HEAD>State Monopoly Over Farm Supplies Causing Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's attempt to suppress independent
suppliers and restore monopoly control over distribution of farm
supplies and equipment have caused major disruptions in the market,
an official daily said Monday.
   The government decision this year to reassert control over farm
materials has ``aggravated the shortage, reduced production,
blocked transfer between provinces, created official speculation
and furthered price hikes,'' the China Daily said.
   The daily, citing a survey taken by the Beijing-based newspaper
Economic Information, said producers of fertilizer, pesticides and
plastic sheeting are going broke because of low state-set prices
for their goods, while high markups on products then sold by the
state are ``arousing resentment of producers and consumers.''
   The government moved last year to restore central controls over
agriculture and industry to counter rising prices and profiteering
that have accompanied economic reforms under which commodity value
is to some extent determined by market forces.
   Requirements that producers must sell to state monopoly
departments rather than directly to farmers have led to delays and
economic losses, the report said.
   In the central province of Anhui, 60 percent of fertilizer
factories lost money in the first quarter of 1989. Overall, 52 of
the country's 91 factories making plastic sheeting halted
operations and another 21 reduced production because of low prices
and delayed payment from the state.
   Both stockpiling and supply shortages have occurred because some
state offices, to protect local interests, have imposed
restrictions on selling materials to other provinces.
   Some government companies, taking advantage of the monopoly,
have speculated in hard-to-get materials. The State Price Bureau
found that 95 percent of illegal price rises during a three-month
period this spring were done by state monopoly companies.
   Prices of agricultural materials were up 23.8 percent in the
first quarter of the year, and sales declined.
   Grain production has stagnated for four straight years, largely
because farmers put off by rising costs and low state-determined
prices for their crops have switched to other cash crops or gone
into sideline businesses.
   One major problem, apparently unresolved, has been a
double-track pricing system where some materials are sold by the
state at low prices and others are available on the free markets at
usually much higher prices.
   The system has led to widespread corruption, with producers and
officials diverting fertilizer, seeds and other goods from state
channels and forcing farmers to turn to the free markets.

   The car exploded as Shrewi, identified as a clerk in the Saudi

   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
   A year ago, another Saudi Arabian embassy employee, Abdulgawi
Bedawi, was shot and killed in front of his home.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad in Hijaz claimed
responsibility for Bedawi's assasination. The previously unheard of
group was believed made up of Shiite zealots loyal to Iran.

<TEXT>
   Civilian government now prevails in Latin
America, and Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama is being
isolated to a degree not seen since the cases three decades ago of
Gen. Rafael Trujillo and Fidel Castro.
   What role, if any, the rejection will play in bringing Noriega
down is a question. While indicating solid support for President
Bush's efforts to oust Noriega, the condemnation clearly does not
include support for direct U.S. intervention.
   On Friday in Washington, Bush said he believes his feelings
about Noriega, who commands the Panamanian military and controls
the government, ``are shared by my colleagues south of the border.''
   Seven Latin American leaders meeting last week in this desert
city 185 miles southeast of Lima condemned ``the continued lack of
democracy, and human rights violations,'' in Panama.
   They continued the ``indefinite suspension'' of the Noriega
regime from the Group of Eight, an informal group of which Panama
was a founding member three years ago.
   At the same time, the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela said the 1977 treaties that
turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the end of 1999 should be
respected fully.
   Heat started building on Noriega after U.S. officials accused
him of trafficking in drugs. In February 1988, he was indicted in
Florida on federal narcotics charges.
   At the recent meeting of the Inter American Press Association in
Monterrey, Mexico, Roberto Eisenmann, editor of an opposition
newspaper in Panama, said Noriega had created ``the first
narco-military regime in the world.''
   Noriega has responded to pressure with increasingly harsh
treatment of opponents.
   He is seen in the region as a throwback to the old-style
military dictator. Noriega summed up his view of power recently as
``blows for the weak, bullets for enemies, money for friends.''
   President Alan Garcia of Peru, who extended the red carpet two
years ago when Noriega visited Lima, now is among the general's
severest critics.
   Garcia told the opening summit session he was using the occasion
``to express publicly the Peruvian people's and the Peruvian
government's repudiation and condemnation of the military
dictatorship'' in Panama.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, who once had warm
relations with Noriega, called his regime ``a masked dictatorship''
and Guillermo Larcos Cox, Peru's foreign minister, declared: ``We
cannot allow a country like Panama that scoffs at and ridicules the
democratic system to continue with us.''
   In May, after annulling elections outside observers said were
swept by the opposition, Noriega chose economist Francisco
Rodriguez to be president.
   Peru and Venezuela immediately recalled their ambassadors, and
virtually all other Latin American countries followed suit. Even
President Augusto Pinochet of Chile, a general often criticized for
a poor human rights record, quietly ordered his envoy back to
Santiago.
   Now Noriega finds himself isolated from other Latin American
nations, an example of rejection not seen in more than a generation.
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Trujillo suffered similar
repudiation, but only after Venezuela presented evidence of the
Dominican Republic dictator's involvement in an attempt to
assassinate the Venezuelan president, Romulo Betancourt.
   Venezuela again sought regional solidarity in the early 1960s
when Castro's Cuba trained and financed leftist guerrillas fighting
the Venezuelan government.
   Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States and
all Latin American countries but Mexico broke relations. Most
governments have restored ties since, however, and the ICA summit
urged the renewal of Cuba's OAS membership.
   Efforts to isolate Castro were hampered by enthusiastic support
for him among leftist groups throughout Latin America, but no
pro-Noriega voices are being heard.
   Whether Latin American rejection will have an effect on Noriega
remains to be seen; it appeared to have little on Trujillo or
Castro. Trujillo resisted the pressure until his assassination in
1963 and Castro remains in power.

   The pilot-management group trying to take over
the parent of United Airlines will have to consider wooing those
who oppose the deal, bringing in other backers or making an offer
with more securities, analysts said.
   The group's $6.75 billion cash offer for UAL Corp. collapsed
last week when banks, largely Japanese, refused to finance the
deal. That helped trigger the steepest one-day decline in the stock
market since the Oct. 19, 1987 crash.
   UAL stock plunged $60 a share to $219.34 by midday today on the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading in the company's shares was halted
Friday and many traders trying to unload the stock were forced to
postpone their sales until today.
   All parties to the bid _ the Air Line Pilots Association,
United's managers and British Airways PLC _ spent the weekend
restructuring the offer, said pilots union spokesman Hank Krakowski.
   ``We are confident we can restructure the transaction and can
move ahead,'' he said Sunday. ``All I can say is we're not
committing to any timetable, but we intend to move as rapidly as we
can.''
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said today that the company was not
in a position to comment on a revised offer. A British Airways
statement from London reiterated the company's commitment to
reviewing any revised bid and completing the deal.
   Published reports today said a new bid might be disclosed early
this week. The Chicago Tribune quoted unidentified sources as
saying the original all-cash offer might be a package of cash and
scurities with a nominal value of $300 a share _ the same per-share
value as the initial bid.
   One speculator, whom the newspaper did not identify, said the
revised offer might contain $250 to $270 a share in cash, with the
remainder in securities.
   Bankers who turned down the UAL proposal said in interviews with
the Wall Street Journal that the market might have misinterpreted
the significance of the collapsed deal. They said banks didn't
suddenly become unwilling to finance takeovers, they just didn't
like this particular UAL buyout plan, which called for unattractive
fees and interest rates to banks.
   Industry analyst Louis Marckesano said the pilot-management
group should move quickly with a restructured plan to calm the
market, which tumbled on Friday with a 190-point drop on the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   ``I don't think it has to be done (today), but there has to be
some indication they're working on a revised bid,'' said
Marckesano, of the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc.
   ``At this stage, everybody's waiting'' to see what the revised
bid will look like, said Marckesano. ``It'll be two weeks before we
know what the ultimate outcome will be and how it's going to be
structured.''
   He suggested the buyout group try to enlist the backing of the
Machinists union, which had vehemently opposed the takeover bid, to
make the offer more attractive.
   ``Or perhaps bring in outside financing ... somebody like a
friend of the group,'' Marckesano said. ``Perhaps (Marvin) Davis
restating his backup bid at $300 a share could contribute to the
deal in some form or another.''
   But Robert Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., said he doubted Davis _ a California billionaire whose bid
was rejected by the UAL board _ could find financing for his offer
since the pilot-management group could not.
   ``I doubt very much if he would be anxious at this point'' to
press a bid, Joedicke said, predicting the restructuring of the
pilots-management offer would involve a combination of cash and
securities.
   A spokesman for Davis said Friday that Davis had no statement on
whether he would pursue his offer.

   Evangelist Jim Bakker says he will continue
his television ministry, despite his conviction on fraud charges,
as soon as he and his wife, Tammy Faye, can pay some bills.
   ``We're going back on television, whether it's me or Tammy or
Tammy and me together,'' Bakker said Sunday upon return to his New
Covenant Church in Orlando.
   Earlier this month, Bakker was convicted of defrauding
supporters of $3.7 million in connection with his former PTL or
Praise the Lord ministry and its Heritage USA Christian retreat at
Fort Mill, S.C.
   Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 24. Bakker faces a maximum
120-year prison sentence and fines totaling $5 million.
   Bakker took to the pulpit at the storefront church from which he
and his wife have been broadcasting their new ``Jim and Tammy
Show'' intermittently since moving to Orlando in May.
   No shows have been broadcast since his conviction at Charlotte,
N.C. His lawyers had said after the trial that the TV ministry was
suspended indefinitely.
   Bakker refused to meet with reporters and the media was barred
from Sunday's service, but from outside Bakker could be heard
speaking freely about his trial and his faith to a crowd of 50 to
100 people.
   He denied defrauding so-called partners in Heritage USA who were
told they could have three nights free lodging a year in exchange
for large donations, and said that if he is sentenced to prison he
will go to jail an innocent man.
   Bakker, 49, resigned from PTL in 1987 amid a sex scandal
involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Mrs. Bakker told the crowd her faith is strong.
   ``I'm counting on God's peace,'' she said. ``I don't know what
the next few weeks might bring. My emotions go up and down like a
roller coaster.''
   After the service, Bakker ducked out a back door trying to avoid
reporters and photographers. A ministry spokesman said he had made
an agreement with his laywers not to talk to reporters.

<HEAD>China's Population Jumps Again in 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There will be more than 1 million new babies in
China in 1989 than last year because of failures to follow through
on the government's tough family planning policies, a senior
government official has said.
   State Family Planning Commission head Peng Peiyun said more than
23 million babies will be born in 1989, about 1.18 million more
than in 1988, the official China Daily reported Monday.
   Peng, speaking to family planners, said this year's birth rate
will exceed 21 per thousand, and natural population growth 15 per
thousand. Last year the birth rate was 20.8 and the growth rate
14.2 per thousand.
   China's population growth, which reached as high as 33 per
thousand in 1963, decreased dramatically when the government in the
1970s inaugurated a family planning policy based on one child per
family.
   The natural growth rate fell to 10.8 per thousand in 1984 and
11.2 per thousand in 1985. But it has since been rising again as
women born in the baby boom period of the early 1960s reach
childbearing age and more people in rural areas defy the one-child
rule.
   A growth rate of 15 per thousand would be the highest since 1975.
   China's population, which stood at 540 million when Communist
rule began in 1949, hit 1.1 billion in April this year. China had
hoped to keep population down to 1.2 billion at the end of the
century, but demographers now say it will be closer to 1.3 billion,
about one-fifth of the world's people.
   ``One must keep a sober mind over the country's serious
population issue and make greater efforts to publicize the
importance of family planning,'' Peng said.
   She said programs had fallen short in rural areas, where the
reinstitution of family farming under China's economic reforms has
encouraged farmers to have more children to help in the fields.
   Affluent farmers also are able to pay fines imposed for having
more than one child, and many rural areas, bowing to the strong
desire for sons to carry on the family name, are allowing farmers
whose first child is a girl to try again.
   Peng said better publicity and education are needed at the
grassroots level, especially in areas where poverty is high, saying
such methods work better than tough policies and fines.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states, and possibly private
citizens, may use federal antitrust law to break up corporate
mergers.
   The court said it will hear arguments by California officials
seeking to scuttle the $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha
Beta supermarket chains.
   Today's action kept in effect an order issued by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor in August that blocks completion of the merger.
   The case is California vs. American Stores, 89-258.
   
   LAROUCHE
   
   The court turned away an appeal by a political action committee
linked to fringe presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche. It now
faces having to pay $2.7 million in contempt-of-court fines.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the National
Democratic Policy Committee's challenge to fines stemming from a
federal mail fraud and conspiracy prosecution.
   The case is National Democratic Policy Committee vs. U.S.,
89-320.
   
   UNION DUES
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a right-to-work group that
sought to limit the power of unions to collect dues from
non-members.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments in an
Illinois case that the group was treated unfairly by a federal
appeals court.
   The cases are National Right to Work Foundation vs. AFSME,
89-287, and Gilpin vs. AFSCME, 89-292.
   
   PAN AM
   
   The court refused to free Pan American World Airways from having
to pay $951,500 plus interest to two families of 1974 crash victims.
   The justices, without comment, left intact the awards stemming
from the April 22, 1974, crash in Indonesia of a Pan Am plane
flying from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. All 96 passengers and 11 crew
members died in the accident.
   The case is Pan Am vs. Causey, 89-157.
   
   PENALIZING LAWYERS
   
   The court agreed to provide some guidelines for penalizing
lawyers who file improper lawsuits.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a Washington, D.C., law
firm penalized $21,402 for filing an antitrust suit based on
inadequate research.
   The case is Cooter &amp; Gell vs. Hartmarx Corp., 89-275.
   
   VIDEOTAPED ANSWERS
   
   The court agreed to consider reinstating the drunken driving
conviction of a Pennsylvania man videotaped answering policce
questions about his height, weight and color of his eyes.
   The court said it will decide whether police violated the
motorist's rights when they videotaped his responses before warning
him of his right to remain silent or have a lawyer present.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Muniz, 89-213.
   
   INHERITANCE TAXES
   
   The court backed out of deciding whether the Internal Revenue
Service, when assessing inheritance taxes, may challenge deductions
state courts have allowed for legal fees and executor's commission.
   The justices agreed last February to decide the issue in an
appeal by a New York lawyer who acted as executor and attorney for
a $450,000 estate.
   The case is White vs. U.S., 88-928.

   Police were placed on heightened alert
for anti-American protests Monday and security was bolstered at
U.S. facilities after an attack last week on the U.S. ambassador's
residence.
   National Police Headquarters said they feared more anti-American
protests and attacks on U.S. facilities while President Roh Tae-woo
is in the United States this week for talks with President Bush.
   Thousands of radical students in seven cities took part in
anti-U.S. protests Friday and Saturday, burning American flags and
demanding Roh call off his Oct. 15-20 visit.
   Additional police have been assigned to the U.S. Embassy and
other American facilities, but officials declined to give details.
Riot police also were told to enter college campuses to arrest
radical student leaders or stop the burning of U.S. flags, police
said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said security talks between Korean and
U.S. officials were under way to prevent a recurrence of Friday's
violent attack by six radical students at the U.S. ambassador's
residence.
   The students climbed over a stone wall, hurled homemade bombs at
guards and rampaged through the residence of U.S. Ambassador Donald
Gregg with iron bars, smashing artwork and windows. Gregg and his
wife escaped unharmed.
   The country's main dissident alliance, Chominyon, defended the
radical attack and demanded Gregg's recall to Washington, saying he
supported military rule when he was CIA station chief in Seoul in
the 1970s.
   The alliance also demanded the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. stroops
based in South Korea and an end to U.S. demands for greater access
to South Korean markets. The radicals, a small but powerful
minority, have little support because of their violent tactics.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Monday that U.S. officials were
conferring with Korean police to determine how security around U.S.
facilities could be upgraded to prevent future attacks.
   ``We're looking for ways to cooperate better with the Korean
police, and for the Koreans to cooperate better with us,'' said a
spokesman, requesting anonymity. The embassy has about a dozen
Marine guards, and the ambassador's residence is protected by a
private security agency.
   South Korea provides protection to diplomatic personnel and
assigns patrols to the perimeters of all U.S. facilities, including
the headquarters of the 8th U.S. Army in Seoul.
   National Police Headquarters, embarrassed over the breach in
security, announced it fired the police station chief for failing
to prevent the attack on the U.S. residence. It also said four
police officers were held for disciplinary action and a warning was
issued to the Seoul police director.

   A countdown suspended for five days
by a failed engine computer resumed without a hitch today and a
federal appeals court removed a legal obstacle to Tuesday's launch
of space shuttle Atlantis.
   Hours after the countdown started up, an appeals court in
Washington dismissed environmentalists' request to stop the launch
because of the nuclear-powered Galileo spaceship that will be
aboard.
   The anti-nuclear activists, who had appealed a lower court's
rejection of their request, fear that a Challenger-style accident
could poison the atmosphere with plutonium from Galileo's power
pack.
   But the three-judge appeals panel, headed by chief judge
Patricia Wald, said last week's order by U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch was not appealable.
   More than 30 activists marched this morning on a Kennedy Space
Center gate about 10 miles from the launch pad. Eight of them were
arrested on trespassing charges after they walked through a line of
security guards at the gate.
   The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice has threatened to
stop Tuesday's liftoff by infiltrating the launch area danger zone.
   The countdown was resumed at 12:01 a.m. when the traditional
call to stations summoned workers to their posts in the control
center and on the launch pad.
   ``We see nothing standing up and going to bite us,'' NASA test
director Al Sofge said today after workers had completed early
tasks, including checks of the guidance system and preparations for
fueling the spaceship.
   Liftoff of Atlantis and its crew of five astronauts was set for
a 26-minute period starting at 12:57 p.m. Tuesday. That's when
Earth and Jupiter will be aligned properly for Galileo to orbit the
giant planet in 1995 after a six-year voyage.
   The weather outlook was improving with forecasters today
increasing from 70 to 80 percent the chance that conditions will be
good at launch time.
   Shuttle managers on Sunday gave the go-ahead to restart the
countdown after assessing the readiness of the shuttle and
replacing the bad computer that forced a postponement of the
launch, scheduled originally for last Thursday.
   ``We retested the computer and everything looks fine,'' test
director Mike Leinbach told reporters.
   Astronaut Donald Williams, who commands Atlantis' crew, praised
technicians who worked around the clock for four days to make the
computer swap, saying they ``did a super job.''
   Launch preparations were taking place under the tightest
security ever for a shuttle flight because of the threats from
anti-nuclear activists. In all, 49.4 pounds of radioactive
plutonium-238 will be aboard to provide electricity to operate
Galileo's systems.
   Large areas of the Kennedy Space Center were closed to the
public and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
mobilized more than 200 armed guards and helicopter and boat
patrols.
   The astronauts are to release the $1.5 billion Galileo from
Atlantis' cargo bay about 6{ hours after they reach orbit. An hour
later, a rocket motor will start the 6,700-pound craft on a
roundabout trip that will cover 2.4 billion miles to Jupiter.
   In December 1995, a 737-pound probe released from Galileo is to
plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers and take the first samples of
the Jovian atmosphere.
   The main Galileo craft will enter an orbit around the planet,
and its cameras and 10 scientific instruments will gather
information on temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud
characteristics and gravity.
   Galileo also will study Jupiter for clues to the formation of
the solar system. Many scientists believe the planet still holds
much of the material, in the original state, from which the sun and
planets formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   Planners say the craft's investigations of Jupiter will be the
most scientifically rich interplanetary mission yet. The pictures
it relays will be up to 1,000 times sharper than those obtained by
the Voyager spacecrafts.
   ``Galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing, as
the Voyagers did,'' said Edward C. Stone, one of the mission
scientists. ``Being there and observing over a period of nearly two
years will allow us to sort out the dynamics of Jupiter and its
moons.''

<HEAD>Old Boy Scout Style of Camping Too Tough on Wilderness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service wants people to forget
some of the camping techniques they learned as Boy Scouts.
   And recognizing that times have changed, the Boy Scouts have
revised their handbook and are urging young campers to leave their
hatchets at home.
   Rangers such as Michelle Kaptur, who patrols the high wilderness
of the Cascade Range, are telling campers that it's no longer good
enough to leave a clean camp in the wilderness. The Forest Service
wants you to leave no trace of a camp at all, especially not a ring
of rocks where you built a fire.
   ``When you leave a fire ring, the next person says, `Hey!
There's a camp! Let's use it!''' Kaptur explained to a group of
campers at Quinn Meadows outside Bend. ``After 300 people use it,
it's not a wilderness anymore.''
   ``There is this whole cultural image of what camping is,'' she
said in an interview. ``In the new Star Trek movie, there's a scene
where they're sitting around a campfire. They had looked through
the computer log to find out what camping is. And it's exactly
true. You have to have a fire ring. You have to have marshmallows.
That's all true.
   ``But it doesn't work anymore. There's too many of us for it to
work.''
   The urge to build a campfire _ what Kaptur calls the television
of the wilderness _ is so strong that the most popular wilderness
areas of the Deschutes National Forest no longer have any dead wood
for fires within reach of a human.
   ``People don't realize that at ground level all those little
twigs they use for fires have a purpose,'' Kaptur said. ``They
(decompose and) feed the trees.''
   The 10th edition of The Official Boy Scout Handbook, due out in
January, for the first time advises young campers to cook on a
stove rather than a fire and to leave their hatchets behind.
   Since the first handbook came out in 1910, the book that has
taught millions of Americans how to camp has described the joys of
cooking over an open fire and using an ax to hew a camp from the
wilderness.
   ``That's when you'll really feel yourself akin to the early
American pioneers hewing their homes out of the wilderness,'' reads
the 1962 handbook.
   The handbook's latest edition doesn't even feature the Official
Boy Scout Hand Axe, handbook editor J.D. Owen said from his office
in Irving, Texas.
   ``In the old days, you could go pitch a camp anywhere and chop
down trees to build pioneer projects and nobody would care,'' said
Owen. ``These days they do care. High-impact techniques are not
suitable anymore, and we don't teach them.''
   Robert C. Birkby, author of the new handbook, said the Boy
Scouts want to influence beginning campers.
   ``Here is a real opportunity to make a difference in the way
that young people, future adults, view the environment in which
they live and can take an active part in making some substantial
changes in the quality of that environment,'' Birkby said from his
home in Seattle.
   ``When people think of scout camping now, I hope they will think
of small, very environmentally aware groups that are able to go
deep into the backcountry and leave no trace of their passing,'' he
said.
   Cliff Blake, national coordinator for the Forest Service's ``No
Trace'' camping program, has a tough job trying to spread the word
with a meager budget and no animal champion to help, the way Smokey
Bear sniffs for forest fires and Woodsy Owl hoots at polluters.
   Blake went to the Boy Scouts for help about five years ago and
now counts on them to help promote No Trace camping.
   ``We were talking about 18 million visitors to the national
forest system back in 1946,'' said Blake. ``Now we are looking at
225 million per year doing their thing. The land hasn't expanded
any. But the people certainly have.''

   Gloria Horowitz thinks her husband Sheldon is
the greatest thing since sliced bread, and that's the way she wants
him immortalized: with a sandwich named in his honor at the Stage
Delicatessen.
   The Stage, home of overstuffed sandwiches named for celebrities,
is running a contest to select a common person for a spot on the
menu alongside the ``Mike Tyson Triple Decker Knockout'' and the
``Donald Trump Power Special.'' And Mrs. Horowitz thinks Sheldon is
a winner.
   ``Because my husband is renowned for his honesty, this sandwich
should be open-faced, revealing all the beautiful truth of its
contents,'' she writes.
   The ingredients in a Sheldon Horowitz sandwich: Tongue (because
Sheldon loves to talk), red bell peppers, half-sour pickles,
lumpfish caviar, smoked turkey, green-leaf lettuce and mustard on
pumpernickel bread.
   The Tuckahoe couple will learn Thursday whether this Horowitz
hoagie will triumph over more than 150 other entries in the contest
sponsored by Stage co-owners Paul Zolenge and Louis Auerbach.
   The idea for the contest, Zolenge said, stemmed from the
restaurant's traditional practice of taking Polaroid snapshots of
celebrities who dined there. Other customers often wanted to have
their pictures taken, and asked why they were not given the
spotlight.
   ``The common customer really is more important than the stars,''
said Zolenge. ``If not for them, we wouldn't be here.''
   The winner is to appear on Stage menus in all three of the
deli's locations _ the original, on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, as
well as branches in Boston and Los Angeles. In addition, the winner
will receive $100 and a dinner for four at the Stage Deli in New
York.
   The rules specified, ``No one who has made a significant
contribution to the arts, theater, music, literature, pop culture
or sports may enter. In other words, Woody Allen need not apply.''
   Brett Eidman of Manhattan took the rules seriously.
   ``Be assured,'' he wrote, ``I have not made any significant
contribution to the arts or to mankind. In fact, sometimes my
uselessness even gets to me and I try to sleep it off.''
   His sandwich would be corned beef on club, but the meat would be
sliced so thin that it resembles ham, which befits him, Eidman says.
   Who could be more appropriate, ask friends of the ``unfamous''
producer Wheeler Jackson, than the man ``who has done it all, or at
least tried to?''
   ``A regular guy, just slugging it out, day by day doing the best
he can,'' reads his description. Jackson, they say, appears in a
recent New York Lottery commercial as a ``real person'' _ sure
testimony to his typicality.
   Bubbles Helfman insists that she is even more typical. ``My
problem,'' she says, ``is that I want the whole left side of the
(Stage's) menu.''
   ``So I end up tasting a little of each. From my plate. My
husband's plate. My boss's plate. Tourists from South Dakotas'
plates. (I'm not proud. I'll schnorr from anyone...),'' said
Helfman about her sandwich sampling.
   As a solution, Helfman proposes ``The Bubs,'' a platter
comprising five mini-sandwiches to satisfy the palates of fickle
eaters.
   Three judges will select the winner, among them baseball players
Gary Carter and Don Mattingly, both of whom have left their mark on
the game and on the Stage Deli's menu.
   Evidently, there are ordinary sandwich fans everywhere. Entries
came from throughout the metropolitan area, from several states and
from both coasts.
   Some were in prose, some in verse. One woman signed her rhyming
recipe ``with apologies to Shakespeare.'' Another could think of no
better wedding present for her fiance than to have a sandwich named
for him.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ford Foundation announced Monday a
five-year, $10 million program to make math education more
meaningful to poor children.
   ``There is a growing awareness that we must do a better job of
recognizing and helping develop the full range of talents of all of
our students, especially those who are black and brown,'' said
foundation Franklin Thomas at a news conference.
   Project QUASAR _ Quantitative Understanding: Amplifying Student
Achievement and Reasoning _ aims to help schools come up with new
approaches to enliven mathematics in grades four through eight.
   The project, to be administered by the University of
Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center, will select
five schools in impoverished communities by next spring, train
teachers and administrators next summer, and bring the program to
classrooms next fall.
   It will expand to at least 10 more urban and rural schools by
1991-92, the foundation said.
   The idea, said project director Edward Silver, is to help
schools go beyond boring drills and rote memorization.
   In QUASAR classrooms, students will be encouraged to investigate
problems for several weeks, they will work together in groups, and
will be allowed to use calculators and other technology to solve
problems, said Elizabeth K. Stage, executive director of the
California Science Project and a member of the QUASAR technical
advisory panel.
   U.S. 13-year-olds ranked last in a recent comparison of math
proficiency with youngsters in Canada, Ireland, Korea, Britain and
Spain. Only 40 percent of U.S. youngsters showed proficiency in
solving moderately difficult two-step math problems, while 78
percent of Koreans could do so.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 banana workers
returned to work Monday after a 12-day strike, President Jose
Azcona Hoyo said.
   U.S.-based Castle and Cooke agreed to give raises to 70 workers
whose jobs at the El Huguerito plantation, 185 miles north of
Tegucigalpa, were eliminated when a packing plant was sold, Azcona
Hoyo said. The amount of the raise is yet to be negotiated.
   The dispute began Sept. 18 when the company sold the plant to
independent packers and transferred the workers without giving them
raises. Under Honduran law, workers can only be transferred with
their consent and if there are economic benefits.
   The agreement was reached in four days of talks mediated by
Azcona Hoyo, who said Honduras lost an estimated $5.3 million.
   Honduras exports 50 million 100-pound crates of bananas a year
to the United States and Europe.
   Azcona Hoyo had threatened to declare a state of emergency after
the Workers Confederation and the National Farmworkers
Organization, which have 500,000 members, said they would strike.
   The San Francisco-based Castle and Cooke sells about 60 percent
of the country's banana exports. U.S.-based United Brands has the
other 40 percent.

<HEAD>Business Sales Outpace Inventory Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business sales far outpaced inventory
accumulation in August, the government said Monday in a report that
one analyst attributed to a mini-inventory correction.
   The Commerce Department said inventories edged up 0.3 percent to
a seasonally adjusted $789.9 billion while sales advanced a steep
3.1 percent to $526.8 billion. The pace in inventories was down
from a 0.9 percent hike in July while sales rose from a 0.9 decline
the previous month.
   The combination of sales advancing far faster than the
accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots is good news for the
economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
   ``Basically, the inventories do not appear to show any signs of
vulnerability,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for The
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``I've been impressed by how managements have been keeping
inventories from getting seriously out of hand,'' he said.
   The Commerce report showed a decrease in the ratio of
inventories to sales from 1.54 in July to 1.50 in August. That
means it would take one and a half months to exhaust inventories at
the August pace.
   Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of
the total, were up only 0.3 percent, while wholesalers' backlogs
actually dropped 0.1 percent.
   Retailers' inventories, however, rose 0.7 percent, which
economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York
attributed in large part to a 1.6 percent advance in automobiles.
   Niemira described the slowing pace of inventory growth as a
``mini-inventory correction'' that began last year in manufacturing
and has been working its way through the other sectors.
   Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, rose 5.6 percent,
followed by wholesalers', up 1.5 percent. Retailers' sales gained
0.7 percent.
   Overall both inventories and sales were 7.1 percent above those
of August 1988.

   E. Robert Wallach, a close associate of former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was sentenced today to six years
in prison and fined $250,000 for his racketeering conviction in the
Wedtech Corp. scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen said Wallach used his influence
to gain access ``to the back steps of the White House'' and made
almost half a million dollars as a result.
   Wallach, 55, a prominent personal injury lawyer from San
Francisco, was found to have illegally received $425,000 from the
now-defunct South Bronx defense contractor to influence Meese and
other government officials as part of Wedtech's efforts to gain
government business.
   He was convicted Aug. 8 by a jury in Manhattan federal court of
racketeering, fraud and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government.
   His co-defendants _ R. Kent London and W. Franklyn Chinn _ were
convicted at the same trial of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from payments they received
from Wedtech.
   Chinn, 47, of San Francisco, Meese's former financial adviser,
was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $100,000. London,
46, of Honolulu, a Chinn business associate, was sentenced to five
years in prison and fined $250,000.
   In a statement ot the judge before sentencing, Wallach said
there was a maxim that went, ``Too much success can bring failure.''
   ``I am the epitome of that and I am paying for it,'' he said.
   The judge denied defense motions to throw out the verdict based
on the dismissal of a juror who called in sick, and based on
defense arguments that the law Wallach was convicted of breaking
was unconstitutionally vague.
   Wallach, who was hired by Wedtech as a consultant, was found to
have defrauded the company and its shareholders of a $125,000
payment in 1983, which he billed as work for the company's public
stock offering but was actually for his efforts to influence Meese
and others to secure an Army contract for Wedtech.
   He also was convicted of illegally receiving $300,000 from
Wedtech officials, purportedly for helping the company acquire
shipyards and a Michigan tug-barge system.
   The jury found the money was actually a payment in anticipation
of Wallach's employment at the Justice Department where he could
influence Meese and other officials. Wallach was hired by the
Justice Department.
   The $300,000 payment also was the basis for the conspiracy to
defraud the government charge.
   Wedtech, once a small machine shop, grew into a $100 million
government contractor through a Small Business Administration
program that set aside contracts without competitive bidding for
minority-controlled companies.
   Evidence at trials has shown that Wedtech continued to receive
the no-bid contracts through a series of bribe schemes.
   Wallach testified at the trial that he has been a close friend
of Meese since they attended law school together. He represented
Meese during his confirmation hearings for the attorney general
post and at a special prosecutor's investigation in 1984.
   Meese was never charged in the Wedtech scandal, although his
ethics were questioned by a special prosecutor in Washington who
said Messe could have been hit with tax and conflict of interest
charges.
   The former attorney general testified for Wallach and said
Wallach had never asked him to do anything improper for Wedtech.

   President Bush joined in honoring the late
Rep. Mickey Leland and others for their efforts in fighting hunger
as he proclaimed Monday as World Food Day.
   Bush met with Alison Leland, widow of the Texas congressman who
was killed Aug. 7 when a light plane crashed on a flight to a camp
for Sudanese refugees in Western Ethiopia, and with 12 other
winners of the annual Presidential End Hunger Awards or their
representatives.
   After meeting privately with the recipients in the Oval Office,
Bush appeared with them in the Roosevelt Room of the White House,
where he said, ``What you have demonstrated is that each of us can
make a difference, right in our own neighborhood or on the other
side of the world as well.''
   Bush then signed the proclamation, declaring, ``As we observe
World Food Day, let us renew our determination to seek effective
answers to the problem of world hunger.''
   The awards were presented by entertainers Steve Allen and Connie
Stevens at a ceremony in the Executive Office Building next door to
the White House.
   Mark L. Edelman, acting administrator of the Agency for
International Development, told the audience that as an AID worker
in Africa ``I have seen hunger up close _ I have seen starving
people _ and it's a sight not soon to be forgotten.''
   Allen said he had gone hungry as a teenager.
   ``After three days without food I became a beggar and then I
became a thief,'' he said. ``I went into a store and stole some
food so I could eat it.''
   Those honored along with Leland included three other people who
died when their light plane crashed in Ethiopia in August _ Gladys
D. Gilbert, special projects officer with AID in Ethiopia; Thomas
J. Worrick, acting AID representative in that country; and
Worrick's wife, Roberta.
   Others honored were:
   _Maurice Weiss, a Los Angeles produce merchant who founded a
center for the distibution of fresh produce that would otherwise
have been thrown away.
   _Chevron Crop. for famine relief assistance in Sudan.
   _Ted Danson, an actor in the TV series ``Cheers,'' for his
efforts in promoting television shows on hunger, homelessness and
poverty.
   _Jean Mayer, president of Tufts University, who established the
nation's first graduate school of nutrition.
   _Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., for ``leadership in seeking solutions
to chronic hunger and malnutrition in the United States and
abroad.''
   _The late Alan Woods, administrator of AID from 1987 to 1989.
   _Hill Staffers for the Hungry and Homeless, an organization of
congressional aides who donate food, clothing and other items for
the needy.
   _Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance, which recruits
volunteers for short-term overseas assignments.
   _Julia Taft, former director of the Office of U.S. Foreign
Disaster Assistance.

<TEXT>
   Wesley C. MacIntire, the sole survivor of
the 1980 Sunshine Skyway Bridge disaster, has died of bone cancer.
He was 65.
   He died Saturday.
   Thirty-five motorists were pitched to their deaths in Tampa Bay
when a freighter rammed the bridge, toppling a 1,400-foot section
of steel-and-concrete road.
   The Gulfport resident also was driving across the bridge, on his
way to work the morning of May 9, 1980, when the Summit Venture
smashed into the southbound span.
   MacIntire's pickup truck rode the bridge down. It bounced off
the bow of the ship, breaking his 150-foot fall, then dropped
backward into the water. He was quickly pulled from the wreckage by
the ship's crew.
   That tragedy haunted MacIntire, a retired truck driver,
relatives said Sunday.
   ``He talked about it a lot,'' said his daughter, Donna L.
Robbins, of Springfield, Mass. ``It was hard for him to talk about,
though. He would get hurt over some of the reactions people would
give him, because he was a sensitive person.''
   ``Because his injuries were not so severe, because he didn't
suffer that much, it was like, `Here you are, what are you
complaining about?' But he suffered for the people who died,''
Robbins said.
   Besides his widow, Elizabeth, and daughter, MacIntire is
survived by a son, a brother, and four grandchildren. Services will
be Tuesday in Gulfport.

<HEAD>Hearing For Judge Who Said Murdered Gays Asked For Trouble</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a judge facing charges before a
state judicial panel say a reporter took advantage of the judge
when she published what he thought were off-the-record remarks
about homosexuals.
   Cliff Hutchison, attorney for State District Judge Jack Hampton,
said Dallas Times-Herald reporter Lori Montgomery ``took advantage
of the friendship she cultivated with Judge Hampton to write a
slanted article about the judge.''
   The statement came out in a fact-finding hearing Monday on the
charges made by the state Commission on Judicial Conduct. There was
no testimony at the hearing, but attorneys handed in depositions
and affidavits.
   Hampton told Ms. Montgomery in an interview published Dec. 16
that he gave a light sentence to convicted murderer Richard
Bednarski, 18, in part because Bednarski's two victims were
``queers.'' He made similar statements to The Associated Press.
   The judge said in the interview that victims John Lloyd Griffin
and Tommy Lee Trimble were ``asking for trouble'' by soliciting sex.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets, picking up teen-age boys,''
Hampton said, two weeks after sentencing Bednarski to a 30-year
prison term.
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets for teen-age
boys,'' he said.
   Hampton later apologized for a ``poor choice of words'' and
insisted that he believed the interview was off the record. He has
refused to talk to reporters since.
   Ms. Montgomery later received awards by the Dallas Bar
Association and a gay advocacy group for her work.
   A May 31 letter from the judicial commission announced Hampton
was charged with violating conduct canons barring judges from
commenting on pending cases. Bednarski's attorney had filed a
motion for a new trial at the time the statements were published.
   Hampton also is accused of damaging public confidence in the
integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
   The 11-member commission could dismiss the allegations, censure
Hampton or urge his removal from office by a seven-judge panel.
   After Hampson's remarks came to light, he predicted no one would
remember them in 1990.
   ``We are here to remind them that we have not forgotten,'' Dan
Perry, a member of the Gay Urban Truth Squad, said outside the
courts building Monday. ``We are here to remind Judge Hampton and
the commission we are not going to forget.''
   Perry was one of about 35 protesters representing the Gay Urban
Truth Squad and Lesbian Visionaries.

<HEAD>High Court Will Hear Attempt to Block Corporate Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider
bolstering the power of states and private citizens to break up
corporate mergers.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by California officials
seeking to use federal antitrust law to kill the $2.5 billion
merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains.
   The high court acted at a time when much of the nation's anxious
attention was focused on Wall Street developments following
Friday's market tailspin. Last week's steep drop was attributed in
part to investor worries over the future of debt-financed corporate
takeovers.
   In other action, the justices:
   _Agreed to take a new look at the rights of motorists suspected
of drunken driving. The court will hear an appeal by Pennsylvania
officials seeking to reinstate the drunken-driving conviction of a
man videotaped answering police questions before he was warned of
his right to a lawyer or to remain silent.
   _Rejected an appeal by a political action committee linked to
fringe presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche. The group now may
have to pay $2.7 million in contempt-of-court fines.
   _Refused to free Pan American World Airways from having to pay
$951,500 plus interest to two families of victims of a 1974 crash
in Indonesia that claimed 107 lives.
   _Agreed to use a Washington, D.C., case to set guidelines for
penalizing lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits.
   The supermarket case focuses on the merger of Lucky,
California's largest supermarket chain, and Alpha Beta, the fourth
largest. They operate 550 stores between them.
   The high court action Monday will keep in effect an order
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor issued in August blocking completion of
the merger. O'Connor's stay will remain in force until the court
announces a decision in the case, expected by July.
   Alpha Beta's parent company, American Stores, acquired Lucky in
June 1988, intending to merge the two chains under the Lucky name.
   American Stores spokesman Troy D'Ambrosio said Monday that
American is losing $1.5 million a week due to the blocked merger,
on hold since September 1988.
   American Stores said California customers would save more than
$50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger.
But lawyers in the California attorney general's office said in a
lawsuit filed last year that a merger will mean less competition
leading to $440 million in higher prices each year.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles temporarily
blocked completion of the merger, ordering continued separate
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had
occurred.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling in March.
   In effect, the appeals court said Attorney General John Van de
Kamp of California waited too long to sue.
   The appeals court said California officials had the power to
prevent the merger by acting quickly. But the appeals court said
only the federal government, not states and private citizens, may
sue to break up mergers after acquistions are completed.
   O'Connor's order in August had the effect of temporarily setting
aside the 9th Circuit court's ruling.
   The Federal Trade Commission temporarily blocked the merger last
year but later reached an agreement with the corporations that
removed its opposition to the acquisition as long as certain
conditions were met.

<HEAD>Defining the Issues as Indian Election Deadline Approaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his
fractious opposition are drawing the battle lines as the deadline
approaches for calling national elections.
   The issues sharpened in recent days with new accusations of
high-level deceit and ineptitude involving the Gandhi government's
$1.4 billion purchase of artillery guns from the Swedish company AB
Bofors.
   The scandal, in which newspapers and opposition politicians
allege that Bofors paid as much as $50 million in kickbacks to
clinch the 1986 arms contract, has been alternately simmering and
boiling for 2{ years. But with parliamentary elections due no later
than January and speculation heightening that the date will be set
any day now, the opposition has seized upon Bofors with renewed
intensity.
   Bofors came to a boil again Friday, the same day Gandhi failed
to push through Parliament one of his pet projects: a
constitutional amendment to give greater powers to grassroots
governmental groups.
   It was the first time in 21 years and only the second time in
India's 42 years of independence that a government motion had
failed.
   Gandhi's Congress Party mustered 158 votes to the opposition
parties' 83 in Parliament's upper house, but it fell three votes
short of the necessary two-thirds majority in a midnight Friday
vote.
   This defeat could give Gandhi a rallying cry for his re-election
campaign, fueling his offensive against those who opposed his bill
on panchayati raj, whose literal meaning is ``five-man rule,'' a
name derived from traditional village councils composed of five men.
   Gandhi and his Congress Party billed panchayati raj as a
power-to-the-people program, but the opposition maintained it was
actually designed to strip state governments of their power and
extend federal control to local levels.
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Gandhi's foremost political foe, said
Saturday the National Front coalition of opposition parties would
come up with its own _ and ``much better'' _ panchayati raj bill.
   Singh, who once belonged to Gandhi's Congress Party and served
as his defense and finance minister, heads the Janata Dal (People's
Party) and is the National Front's ``convenor,'' a top position. It
is indicative of the coalition's internal rivalries and its need to
placate egos that it also has a chairman and a president.
   The failure of Gandhi's panchayati raj amendment came about 12
hours after Parliament had again debated the Bofors issue, with the
opposition's usual demands for Gandhi to resign over the alleged
kickbacks.
   The latest Bofors debate was sparked by reports carried by The
Statesman, Indian Express and other newspapers that senior members
of the Gandhi government had ``colluded'' with Bofors to conceal
the identity of a Swiss-based company that allegedly received a $12
million payoff for helping Bofors snatch the 1986 arms contract
from other bidders.
   Exactly where any such payoffs went is the mystery. Since 1987,
newspapers and opposition politicians have charged that Bofors paid
up to $50 million in ``commissions'' or kickbacks that ultimately
ended up in the hands of Indians, some of them close to Gandhi or
the Congress Party.
   Gandhi has repeatedly denied that any commissions were paid or
that any Indians received payoffs.
   While the 45-year-old former airline pilot has not been accused
of personally receiving kickbacks, he has been pilloried for
allowing such alleged payoffs to happen.
   With 880 million people, India is the world's largest democracy,
but it is an unruly one. The Congress Party, founded by Gandhi's
grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru, has governed India for all but three
years since the Asian Subcontinent was freed from British colonial
rule in 1947.
   Other parties have usually been fractured along regional,
religious and ideological lines, rarely able to come together with
a unified voice. According to UNICEF and other statistics, about 40
percent of all adults are illiterate. Reports of voting influenced
by fraud and thuggery recur with election.
   Expectations that an election date would be set soon rose when
Parliament adjourned its monsoon session Friday night. The next
step is the dissolution of Parliament by President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman, whose largely ceremonial post is awarded by the prime
minister's Cabinet.
   Once Parliament is dissolved, the election commission must set a
date to vote for new legislators.
   With the January deadline drawing near, it was appropriate that
a group of social workers called the Servants of the People Society
organized a discussion called ``Criminalization of Politics _ How
to Combat and Reverse It.''
   The speakers were drawn from the leadership of the major
political parties.

   It's taking so long to finalize Kim
Basinger's purchase of this northeast Georgia town that the mayor
is reassuring residents the $20 million deal is still on.
   ``Everything's moving along fine,'' said Mayor Henry Braselton.
``There are still bank approvals which have to be completed, still
surveying and title work which isn't yet done.''
   Real estate agent Charles Morris, who is handling the
transaction, said surveying includes a search for industrial waste
on the 1,800 acres the actress is buying.
   Miss Basinger, featured in the movies ``Batman,'' ``My
Stepmother is an Alien'' and ``9{ Weeks,'' will own a bank, an
industrial park, 50 buildings and two miles of interstate highway
frontage, Braselton said Saturday.
   The mayor belongs to the town's founding family, which agreed in
March to sell to Miss Basinger, a native of Athens, Ga. Braselton
predicted at the time that the deal would take six months to
complete.
   ``Actually, it's farther along than I thought,'' the mayor said.
``But I don't know when this will all be finished. I don't know if
it'll be before Christmas or not.''

   Jamie Lee Curtis said she'll probably get
blamed if the television series ``Anything But Love'' is canceled
by ABC.
   ``They will be saying I'm impossible, that I'm not a team
player,'' Miss Curtis said in an interview for the Oct. 21 issue of
TV Guide magazine.
   At the conclusion of the six-episode first season, the
co-executive producer and creator, Wendy Kout, along with
supervising producer and developer Dennis Koenig, quit after
protracted disagreements over scripts.
   But there's no indication the series, starring Miss Curtis and
Richard Lewis, will be canceled.
   ``The scripts weren't always funny enough and I felt from the
beginning that we had no idea what we were doing with my character
and Richard's,'' Miss Curtis said.
   Miss Curtis, whose movies include ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' said
she's preparing to take ``the rap'' if the show goes under.
   ``I've never been very popular, or wanted, by the powerful,''
said Miss Curtis. ``I had to make it slowly, and on my own.''

   Maria Shriver said she depends on her television
career to bolster her confidence and character.
   ``I often sit and wonder, if I had no profession, if everything
were stripped away, would it be OK?'' Shriver said in the November
Glamour magazine. ``I admire people who don't need work to define
themselves, who have great inner strength and a serenity about them
and just feel confident.''
   Shriver, a television anchor, commutes between Los Angeles, New
York and Washington. And when she finally makes it home to her $3
million spread in Pacific Palisades, Calif., her husband, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, is likely to be away making a movie.
   ``It's not like he's waiting for me at home,'' she said. ``But
if I was always waiting for him to come home, it would be worse.''

   Former Black Panther Bobby Seale may not go to
trial on charges of theft and passing bad checks to cover an
$11,000 debt from a barbecue cook-off.
   The debt stems from Seale's participation with a 12-member team
in the May 1988 National Rib Cook-Off to promote a book he wrote on
barbecue techniques.
   Seale, 52, was indicted in February on two counts of theft and
six charges of writing bad checks to cover the cost of pork ribs
and chicken sold to his team, and to pay the motel where the group
stayed.
   Seale has paid off most of the debt, his lawyers said. His trial
was to begin Monday in Common Pleas Court, but it was postponed
until Nov. 20 to allow him to pay off the rest.
   ``I'm sure I can reach total restitution by then,'' Seale said.
   Seale, who works as a community liaison in Temple University's
African-American Studies Department, said he underestimated the
cost of competing in the cook-off and overestimated sales.
   His lawyer, Terry Gilbert, said ``it's a simple restitution case
and not for a criminal court.''
   Roger Kramer, an assistant prosecutor handling Seale's case,
said there's a good chance charges will be revised or dropped.

<HEAD>White House Denies That Bush Unhappy With CIA Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has complete confidence in CIA
Director William H. Webster and is ``fully satisfied'' with him,
the White House said Monday, disputing a report that senior
administration officials were unhappy with his performance.
   ``Rumors of White House displeasure are totally false,'' said
Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Bill
Webster knows he's in good shape. He doesn't have any problems.
He's always been that way. There's never been any problem.''
   Asked how long Webster would have his job, Fitzwater said,
``Everybody comes in with the understanding we serve at the
president's pleasure.''
   In a front-page story, The Washington Post said that
unidentified ``senior officials'' in the Bush administration were
frustrated with Webster's low-profile performance and had begun
talk of replacing him with a more active player.
   The Post quoted White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu as
saying during a recent staff meeting that he had learned more about
the attempted coup from watching Cable News Network than from
Webster's Central Intelligence Agency. However, Fitzwater said that
was incorrect.
   He said Sununu's comment was made at the time of the crackdown
on pro-democracy forces in China _ not the coup attempt in Panama _
and that it ``did not refer to Director Webster.''
   Fitzwater said he talked with Bush extensively about the Post
story and the president ``thinks the newspaper report was
outrageous.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had not actually used the word
``outrageous,'' saying that was ``my characterization of his
overall comments, which were somewhat more extensive. I'm not going
to give you any quotes.''
   Even before Fitzwater denied the story at his regular news
briefing, Scowcroft took the unusual step of issuing a
strongly-worded written statement on his own.
   ``The president is fully satisfied with the performance of the
intelligence community, including during the Panama episode,''
Scowcroft said. ``The president strongly supports Director
Webster.''
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said Scowcroft
was trying to quell speculation that Webster might be on his way
out.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``has complete confidence in Director
Webster and the leadership he's providing at CIA.''
   The White House has been criticized by members of Congress for
not having a more organized flow of information during the Oct. 3
coup. Some members have criticized Bush for not doing more to
assist those seeking to overthrow Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Webster was the head of the FBI from 1978 to 1987, when
then-President Reagan moved him to the CIA post after the
Iran-Contra affair. Bush, a former CIA chief himself, decided to
retain him in that job.

<HEAD>IBM Earnings Fall 29.7 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `For the...'., to CORRECT revenue figures. A
version also moved on financial wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. today
announced what it called a disappointing 29.7 percent decline in
its third-quarter earnings, an outcome that the company signaled
last month.
   The computer giant reiterated that its earnings were hurt by the
strength of the dollar, difficulties making transitions to new
products and an increase in leasing instead of buying by customers.
   On the positive side, IBM said revenue and shipments were up
from a year earlier.
   ``While these short-term financial results are disappointing,
demand for IBM products and services continues to be good
worldwide,'' said IBM Chairman John F. Akers in a statement. The
company was ``confident about the long-term prospects for our
business,'' Akers said.
   IBM said it earned $877 million in the three months ended Sept.
30, or $1.51 a share, down from $1.25 billion, or $2.10 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 4.3 percent to $14.3 billion from $13.7
billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, IBM said its
earnings fell 8.4 percent to $3.17 billion, or $5.43 a share, from
$3.46 billion, or $5.83 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6.5
percent to $42.2 billion from $39.7 billion a year earlier.
   IBM's stock dropped sharply last month after the company said it
expected third-quarter earnings to come in below the then-current
range of analysts' estimates.
   A strong dollar decreases the dollar value of profits earned
overseas in foreign currencies. A switch to leasing lowers the
short-run income from product placements. And a delay in
introduction of a new IBM disk drive for data storage in large
computers has hurt short-term results.

<HEAD>With AM-Gramm-Rudman Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law was
scheduled to trigger $16.1 billion in federal spending cuts on
Monday, following the failure of Congress and President Bush to
agree on a plan to cut the government's budget deficit.
   WHAT THE GRAMM-RUDMAN LAW IS: Passed in 1985 and amended two
years later, the law sets a series of declining targets for
projected deficits for each fiscal year, culminating in a balanced
budget in 1993. The cuts are triggered automatically if the targets
are exceeded.
   WHY THE CUTS ARE BEING MADE: Gramm-Rudman requires the cuts to
be made Oct. 16 if the projected deficit for fiscal 1990 _ which
started Oct. 1 _ surpasses $100 billion by more than $10 billion.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget projected the
deficit Monday to be $116.1 billion.
   HAS IT HAPPENED BEFORE? Twice. In 1986, $11.7 billon were
imposed in January and remained in effect through September, the
end of the fiscal year. In 1987, $23 billion in reductions were
imposed in October and were rolled back in December.
   HOW THIS YEAR'S CUTS ARE APPLIED: Half to defense, half to
domestic programs, or $8.05 billion to each. Because the cuts are
from different dollar totals, that calculates to 4.3 percent cuts
in defense and 5.3 percent in domestic programs.
   WHAT PROGRAMS ARE AFFECTED? All defense programs except for
money owed in contracts. Many domestic programs are exempted,
including Social Security, many other benefit programs, and
payments on the national debt. Certain other programs, such as
Medicare, can be sliced no more than 2 percent.
   EXAMPLES OF CUTS: Defense programs cut from $291.4 billion to
$283.3 billion; foreign aid from $16.3 billion to $15.8 billion;
science and space from $13.7 billion to $13.3 billion; agriculture
from $18.8 billion to $18.2 billion; transportation from $29.1
billion to $28.5 billion; education and social services from $38.2
billion to $37.5 billion; health from $56.6 billion to $56.2
billion.
   WHAT THE PUBLIC WILL FEEL: Very little initially, because of the
many exemptions and because agencies have the flexibility to shift
money around within programs. Many people believe most citizens
will not notice anything at all for several weeks.
   HOW LONG THE CUTS LAST: Technically, they took effect
temporarily Oct. 1. By law, they were invoked permanently Monday.
But Congress can pass legislation at any time rolling them back.

<HEAD>White House Summons Dole Over Armenian Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush adminstration, trying to ward off a
diplomatic rift with Turkey, summoned Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., to the
White House Monday to discuss his proposed resolution memorializing
the ``Armenian genocide'' 75 years ago, a Dole aide said.
   The Turks are up in arms about the resolution because ``they
don't want to be compared with Hitler,'' said Mike McNamara, a
lobbyist for Turkey.
   ``It is the most offensive thing that Congress can do to
U.S.-Turkish relations,'' said Daryal Batibay, the deputy chief of
the Turkish Embassy. He said the measure, if passed, would damage
ties between the United States and Turkey, a close NATO ally that
plays host to American military bases.
   Against that backdrop, Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, asked Dole, the Senate minority leader, to meet
with him on the issue, according to an aide to Dole who asked that
he not be quoted by name.
   Publicly, the administration has remained mute on the emotional
resolution, which has caught President Bush in a bind.
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush said the United
States must acknowledge ``the attempted genocide of the Armenian
people in the last years of the Ottoman Empire. ...'' Some 1.5
million Armenians were killed in the early part of the century.
   But Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, said the administration
had not taken any position on the Dole resolution. The Reagan
administration opposed such resolutions when they previously came
up _ and were defeated _ in the House.
   With the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled to vote on the
resolution Tuesday, Turkey's lobbyists and Bush administration
officials, including Morton Abramowitz, the U.S. ambassador to
Turkey, worked frantically behind the scenes to convince senators
to drop their support for the Dole resolution.
   Several senators, including Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., and Robert Kasten, R-Wis., have already withdrawn
their sponsorship. Others, like Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., have added their names to the resolution.
   Dole needs 50 co-sponsors, half of them Republican, to have the
judiciary committee consider the measure, which would designate
April 24, 1990, as the ``National Day of Remembrance of the 75th
Anniversary of the Genocide of 1915-1923.''
   In a letter to other senators, Dole said the resolution was
prompted by his August visit to Armenia, a part of the Soviet
Union, to visit earthquake victims.
   ``And I can attest, from my own recent visit to Armenia, that
the Armenian people feel real friendship for the United States and
our people,'' he said.
   Both Dole and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said they didn't want
the resolution to be misunderstood as a slap at Turkey.
   ``I would also like to point out that the resolution does not
implicate the government of the Republic of Turkey in this terrible
event,'' Wilson said. Wilson is running for governor in California,
a state with a large population of Armenian descendants.
   Thurmond, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee,
said he pulled his name as a co-sponsor ``since I've learned the
administration strongly opposes the resolution.'' He said he was
weighing whether to support the measure.
   Leahy said he withdrew his name because the Turkish ambassador
said the Turks will allow scholars to study the events from Ottoman
Empire archives. ``He thinks next year would be a better time for a
resolution,'' said Leahy's spokesman, Joe Jamele.
   Kasten's name had been put on the resolution by a staff member
without the senator's knowledge, said Kasten's spokesman, Jim Sims.
Kasten asked that it be taken off, Sims said.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Moscow Regrets Abuse of Psychiatry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said Monday that the
Kremlin regrets the past use of psychiatry as a political weapon.
   The comment by Peter Morozov, the secretary of international
relations for the state-sanctioned All-Union Society of Soviet
Psychiatrists, was a depature from the Kremlin view that has only
hinted at possible, isolated cases of abuse in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's clear that we regret our past, not only (political)
abuses but the whole system,'' Morozov said in an interview.
   His comments came on the eve of a vote by the World Psychiatric
Association on whether to readmit the Soviet group to its ranks.
   The Soviet group was forced to withdraw from the world body in
1983 under threat of expulsion because of allegations that
dissidents in the Soviet Union were being certified as insane and
interned in mental hospitals.
   ``We know of a lot of cases (of political abuse) that have been
reported on medical or legal grounds,'' Morozov said. ``Now, we
want (Western) psychiatrists to come and see suspicious cases and
visit psychiatric hospitals.''
   Earlier Monday, Soviet officials told a news conference that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of reforming society
has led to changes in psychiatric practices in the Soviet Union.
   Yuri Reshetov, the head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's human
rights department, said the government has not yet appointed the
members of an independent Soviet commission to monitor Soviet
psychiatry.
   A Soviet official told a U.S. congressional panel this month
that the eight-member commission had already been set up to prevent
the use of psychiatry ``for non-medical reasons'' and to ``ensure
maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of psychiatry.''
   Reshetov said the authorities were ``still looking'' for
professionals to become members of the commission, which he said is
not connected to any government department or organization.
   The Soviets say 4.5 million people are registered as mentally
ill in the Soviet Union, a decrease of 1 million in the past 1{
years.
   Fini Schulsinger, the secretary-general of the world body who
backs readmission for the Soviet group, said he believes delegates
will vote Tuesday to its unconditional readmission.
   But some delegates, speaking on condition of anonymity, expected
a fierce debate and said readmission might require the Soviets to
guarantee there will be no political abuse.
   The association also will vote Tuesday on whether to admit a
second Soviet group, the Independent Psychiatric Association. Both
Soviet groups can be admitted.
   Congressional sources predicted the independent group would be
admitted because it ws set up to oppose political abuse of
psychiatry.

<HEAD>Party Releases Jiang Speech Calling for Purge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin has
ordered a purge of opportunists ``in leading positions in the
party,'' an official report said Monday without identifying his
targets.
   Jiang's speech was publicized one day after the Beijing city
party committee voted to purge its own ranks by requiring all
members to re-register for examination of their qualifications.
   However, the official Xinhua News Agency said Jiang delivered
his speech in August at a meeting of party organization departments
from around the country. The speech will appear in this week's
issue of Seek Truth, the party magazine.
   Xinhua did not explain the delay in releasing the speech, which
may have been due to disagreement within top party ranks over how
far to go in carrying out the crackdown on dissent. The crackdown
is part of a hard-line backlash to the spring pro-democracy
protests that were crushed by the army in June.
   Many rank and file party members in cities expressed sympathy
with the protests, and some took part. Former party chief Zhao
Ziyang was accused of supporting the protests and ousted from
office along with several top allies, but the party has yet to deal
with many Zhao supporters who remain in place.
   Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying in his speech that ``to ensure the
purity of the party, it is necessary to uncover the opportunists,
especially those in leading positions within the party.'' But he
did not identify them and Xinhua gave no further information.
   Jiang also said the role of party cells should be strengthened
and that exploiters _ a traditional word for wealthy private
businessmen _ should be barred from the party because it ``is the
vanguard of the working class.''
   The party has stepped up its emphasis on class identification
and class struggle since June. Private businesses were allowed to
make a comeback in the past decade under senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's policy of reforming the centralized economy, and the
party had preached that it was acceptable for some people to get
rich. At least one millionaire was admitted to the party.
   Since June, however, the party has denounced ``unequal
distribution'' of wealth and accused businessmen of evading taxes
and breaking other laws.
   ``In the initial stage of socialism, various economic sectors
are allowed to co-exist, with the sector under public ownership
being predominant,'' Xinhua quoted Jiang as saying. ``But we should
not attach undue emphasis to the individual and private economies,
for they can only be a supplement to the public economy.''
   In its weekend resolution, the Beijing party committee also
banned so-called exploiters from its ranks and urged a stronger
party role at the workplace.
   The disclosure of Jiang's speech shows that the Beijing
committee's actions are not those of a radical fringe, but
represent decisions of the party center.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, meanwhile, said he was confident
that economic relations between China and the West will resume
developing despite Western censure of China's crackdown on dissent.
   ``No country in the world can deny that socialist China, with a
population of 1.1 billion ... stands like a giant in the East. It
is impossible for anyone to isolate China,'' he said in an
interview with Japan's Kyodo News Agency. His comments were carried
by Xinhua.
   Japan and most Western countries condemned the Chinese army's
attack on the protesters, in which hundreds and perhaps thousands
were killed. Japan initially froze its aid to China but said last
month it was gradually resuming work on existing projects.
   Yuan, continuing China's policy of trying to discourage Japan
from forming a united front with the West on human rights demands,
said Japan's actions hurt relations but that China had noted
differences between Japan's stand and that of the West. ``I hope
the current unpleasantness will only be a short-lived episode,'' he
said.
   Yuan spoke more harshly of the United States, again accusing it
of interfering in Chinese affairs by condemning the crackdown. He
said it was up to the United States to take the first step in
restoring friendly relations.
   Yuan said the party's top policy-making body, the Central
Committee, will meet to make decisions on ``overcoming economic
disorder,'' but did not give a specific date. He said it may meet
late this month or early in November.
   There has been speculation the party could announce a decision
on any further action against Zhao at the session. Some hard-line
leaders are believed to be pressing for his expulsion from the
party and trial.

   A blind man who has been trying to join the
State Department for more than a decade said Monday he has been
told his wish will be granted under the reversal of a policy that
dates back to the 18th century.
   Avraham Rabby, of New York City, said in a telephone interview
he was informed of the decision last Friday after the State
Department notified Congress of its intention to hire qualified
blind people for the career diplomatic service.
   State Department officials said the decision was based primarily
on technological advances, including optical scanners capable of
``speaking'' written words through a conversion process.
   These advances enable the blind to improve efficiency and limit
the need for readers and other types of outside assistance.
   Another factor contributing to the policy reversal was a federal
law that states that the government cannot disqualify prospective
employees persons because of blindness or other handicaps. It must
also provide ``reasonable accommodations'' to help them overcome
their handicaps.
   In the past, the State Department has insisted on a general
exemption from this law because of the unique circumstances under
which diplomats must work.
   The decision to grant Rabby, 47, an appointment to the Foreign
Service came less than a year after he had been told that blind
people would no longer be allowed to take entrance examinations in
Braille or to use other forms of outside help.
   He had passed five State Department entrance examinations since
1985 but has been attempting to join the Foreign Service since the
Ford administration.
   Last November, State Department officials said they agreed that
they had been following a contradictory policy toward the blind,
allowing them to take the written and oral examinations but never
accepting them as Foreign Service officers.
   Officials attributed the decision to hire the blind to the newly
installed director general of the Foreign Service, Edward J.
Perkins, a former ambassador to South Africa.
   Rabby is a graduate of Oxford University in England with degrees
in Spanish and French and has a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Chicago.
   Born in what is now Israel 47 years ago, he has been blind since
age 8. He lived for 15 years in England and six months each in
France and Spain. He has his own consulting business, helping
disabled people find employment.
   Asked where he would like to serve, Rabby listed posts such as
Japan, the Soviet Union and England but said that issue is yet to
be worked out.
   One official, who asked not to be identified, said the decision
to hire qualified blind applicants means there could be some
relaxation of the State Department policy that all Foreign Service
officers must be ``worldwide available.''
   The official acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for
Rabby to serve in an area faced with wartime conditions.
   Some officials have argued against hiring the blind, contending
that while the United States has facilities for helping the blind
overcome their handicap, most foreign countries lack such
accommodations.
   These officials have said that much of diplomacy involves
reading the ``body language'' of foreign envoys during diplomatic
discussions. Such gestures as winks and nods form part of the
overall message a diplomat must assimilate, the officials said.
   Rabby said the blind are no less able than sighted people to
read other people's language, be it ``silent or verbal.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
expressed concern Monday over reports that a United Nations
official demanded Nicaraguan resistance fighters return home
without assurances they will not suffer reprisals from Sandinista
authorities.
   Baker outlined his thoughts in a letter to U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar following a report in Saturday's
Washington Post that the U.N. official, Francesc Vendrell, had told
the rebels that they had ``ceased to have any raison d'etre,'' or
reason for existence.
   Perez de Cuellar expressed regret over any misunderstandings
that may have arisen and said U.N. policy on Central America is
``rigorously impartial.''
   Vendrell was quoted as telling thousands of rebels assembled in
southern Honduras, ``You are Nicaraguans and not the objects of a
(U.S.) policy that is anachronistic and has been abandoned by the
country that helped you.''
   Baker expressed ``deep concern'' that the remarks, as reported,
contradict the goals that all parties share _ ``the achievement of
democracy in Nicaragua, a necessary condition to assure resistance
members that they have the option to return with safety and freedom
...''
   Baker noted that the Nicaraguan government agreed to these
conditions in three separate meetings with other Central American
countries over the past two years.
   Vendrell went to the border area last Thursday in his capacity
as a member of a U.N.-Organization of American States commission
set up to monitor compliance with a resolution approved by the five
Central American presidents.
   Among other measures, the presidents called for the voluntary
demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5. In return, the Sandinista
government has promised to hold free and fair elections next Feb.
25.
   Baker said the Contras are unlikely to demobilize voluntarily
and ``return to what is recognized as hostile control and
recrimination from the Sandinista government.''
   In a similar vein, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said the ``political and security situation in Nicaragua
must improve and accommodate resistance concerns before they can be
expected to voluntarily demobilize and repatriate.''
   Perez de Cuellar issued a statement at U.N. headquarters
asserting that the comments attributed to Vendrell were selected
from an impromptu statement.
   ``Unfortunately, the comments as quoted in the article, have
given rise to misunderstandings concerning the rigorously impartial
position of the United Nations,'' he said. ``This, the
secretary-general regrets.''
   Perez de Cuellar said Vendrell ``naturally emphasized'' that the
purpose of the commission was to ensure the ``voluntary character
of the process of demobilization and repatriation, which of course,
entails full access by members of the resistance to information, as
well as the free expression of their wishes ...''

<HEAD>Psoriasis Drug Prevents Organ Rejection in Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug used for more than a decade to treat
the skin disease psoriasis is preventing and halting the rejection
of transplanted organs in animals, a researcher said Monday.
   The compound will be tested on human transplant patients when
that is approved the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Dr.
Randall Morris, director of Stanford University's laboratory for
transplant immunology.
   ``It's a promising new addition to the drugs we already have and
is an example of how we are engineering drugs based on our
knowledge of DNA synthesis,'' Morris said.
   The drug mycophenolic acid, produced by a fungus, inhibits the
formation of DNA, the genetic material that also is critical in the
growth of skin lesions common to psoriasis.
   Researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it more easily
absorbed by the body. In its altered form, mycophenolic acid
morpholinoethylester, or RS 61443, it blocks the DNA process
required for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs,
according to Morris.
   ``It's not shutting down DNA all over the body. It's shutting
down DNA synthesis in these (white blood cells), which is exactly
where we want to shut it off,'' Morris said from Atlanta, where he
presented his findings Monday to members of the American College of
Surgeons.
   Morris said it is too early to predict the role RS 61443 might
play in relation to cyclosporine, the popular anti-rejection drug
whose use was pioneered by Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh.
   The two drugs are extremely effective when used together, Morris
said.
   ``It allows you to lower the dose of both drugs, thereby
minimizing the toxic effect,'' he said.
   Cyclosporine, approved for general use by the FDA in 1983,
suppresses the body's entire immune system and therefore enhances
the risk of infection. Side effects include kidney failure.
   High doses of RS 61443 have produced anemia, Morris said.
   Rejection is responsible for most failed transplants, experts
say. There were 12,798 organ transplants in the United States in
1988, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.
   ``Anything that comes along that would lower rejection rates
would be great,'' said Dr. William Vaughn, the network's director
of research.
   Morris and other Stanford researchers have used RS 61443 in more
than 150 heart transplants involving rats, mice and, most recently,
monkeys.
   The drug is manufactured by Syntex Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
   Oral doses of RS 61443 were administered daily for 50 days,
Morris said. The transplanted hearts of rats receiving high doses
functioned properly for more than 200 days. Animals' transplanted
hearts failed within a week when no medication was given.
   The new drug effectively halted and sometimes even reversed
rejection of the rats' transplanted hearts when administered for
the first time five days after surgery, he said.
   Morris said RS 61443 stands out from other experimental
anti-rejection drugs in that its action on the body is fully
understood.
   ``This drug represents a more rational way of affecting or
controlling the immune system because we're actually going to the
heart of biochemistry that we understand,'' he said. ``We're using
our knowledge to develop drugs that control the immune system in a
very predictable way.''

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers imposed price controls Monday on the
private businesses President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fostered to
supply goods and services the state cannot provide.
   The 542-member Supreme Soviet legislature took the action in
response to public accusations that the businesses, known as
cooperatives, have engaged in price gouging.
   When it began debating restrictions in September, legislator
Veniamin Yarin accused cooperatives of ``open robbery of the
working man.''
   Cooperatives are one of the few successes of Gorbachev's
economic reform program. His economic adviser, Leonid Abalkin, has
said Soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an
important part of the economy, agree to treat them equally with
state-run business and allow local governments to regulate them.
   Since they were legalized 2{ years ago, they have grown
dramatically and provide $20 billion in goods and services, Abalkin
has said.
   But last year, the government began taxing the cooperatives, and
expects to receive $2.3 billion from these levies next year.
   On Monday, more restrictions were imposed. The official Tass
news agency said local governing councils will set price ceilings
on consumer goods and services of cooperatives. The ceilings will
apply to products the state has contracted to buy from cooperatives
and items cooperatives manufacture using state-supplied resources.
   The businesses also will come under state price control when
they resell goods purchased from the state. Many cooperatives make
huge profits by buying scarce goods from the state and reselling
them at higher prices.
   Another provision forbids cooperatives from reselling imported
goods at a higher price than the state would charge.
   Legislator Anatoly Sobchak was quoted by Tass as saying the
restrictions ``make it possible to keep cooperative associations
intact and at the same time eliminate profiteering.''
   One deputy had proposed closing all wholesale and retail
cooperatives.
   Previously, cooperatives were exempt from state control over
their prices, and they have been able to obtain scarce goods by
paying off people with access to them.
   In the Sept. 26 debate, Gorbachev asked the legislature how the
cooperatives manage to find soap when no one else can. He noted the
cooperative price might be $7.74 for a bar of soap, when a state
store would charge just 62 cents to $1.55.
   Gorbachev stood by his creations, however.
   ``The main thing for us is to preserve cooperatives,'' he said.
``People see the evident difference between them. Those providing
services, manufacturing, producing construction materials,
repairing, helping, are more than welcome by the people. All those
intermediary cooperatives are considered to be thieves.''

   A diaper-clad ``Indiana Dan'' and his
companion, ``Kennebunk George Bushkin,'' cavort in a coloring book
that takes a cockeyed look at the president and vice president.
   President Bush wears a business suit and has an elephant's nose
and ears in the 48-page book. Vice President Quayle is portrayed as
a chubby baby wearing only a diaper and a golf visor.
   Creator James Travers, a printer and typesetter from Wilmington,
Del., said his inspiration was a nagging question after the two
took office: ``Who is Dan Quayle?''
   The book is called ``Indiana Dan and His Search for Political
Par Excellence.'' In one part, ``Indiana Dan,'' uses a magical golf
putter to play doubles against senators with partner ``Kennebunk
George.'' Before tee-off, Dan must recite the senators' names,
their state capitals, state nicknames and the dates their states
joined the union.
   At the bottom of each page are political quotes from famous
people _ and golf rules and definitions.
   Travers has sold a few hundred copies, at $8.95 each, since the
book was published in July.

   Twin pianists Richard and John Contiguglia
blame a ``cursed'' piece of Franze Liszt music for bringing the
curtain down on a weekend concert.
   The two tried to play the ``Grosses Konzertstuck uber
Mendelssohn's `Liederohne Worte' (Great Concert Piece on
Mendelssohn's `Songs Without Words').'' But a storm Saturday night
knocked out power to the concert hall.
   ``This is another episode of the curse. It's uncanny how many
times something has prevented this song from being played,''
Richard Contiguglia said.
   In 1835, Liszt collapsed while premiering the piece. In 1924,
Ferrucio Busone died shortly before playing it.
   The Contiguglias said the curse even struck them before.
   In 1986, when they were to perform the piece at an annual Liszt
Festival in Holland, the 58-page manuscript was seized by the Dutch
government, which thought Liszt's notes were coded espionage
secrets being passed from East Germany to the West.
   ``Now it's stopped by a storm,'' John Contiguglia said. ``I hate
to see what's going to happen next.''
   The twins will try to play the piece again Thursday.

   Florida real estate developer Joseph
Zappala presented his credentials Monday to King Juan Carlos as
U.S. ambassador to Spain.
   After the ceremony at the Royal Palace, the new U.S. envoy and
the king met privately for 15 minutes.
   Zappala's nomination by President Bush set off a round of
controversy, but he was confirmed two weeks ago.
   According to an editorial in the New York Times in July, the
nomination of the 56-year-old businessman was due to ``a
distinctively large contribution to the Republican Party,
reportedly $126,000.''
   Zappala replaces Reginald Bartholomew, who assumed the post in
September 1986.
   Zappala said last week in Madrid his primary mission would be to
strengthen the already excellent relations between the United
States and Spain.
   The signing in December 1988 of a new eight-year
Spanish-American defense agreement that stipulates the withdrawal
of approximately one-third of the U.S. forces stationed in the
country spelled an end to a period of tension.
   Zappala presented his credentials two days before Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez is to arrive in Washington on his second official
visit to the United States since his Socialist Party scored a
landslide victory in 1982 elections. Polls indicate Gonzalez will
win an unprecedented third term in general elections Oct. 29.

<HEAD>FDA Begins Hearing on Proposed Revamping of Food Labeling Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators opened hearings Monday to
consider revamping the rules for labels describing the contents and
claims of packaged foods, a growing concern among health-conscious
American consumers.
   ``There's a lot more known now about the relationship of diet
and health,'' said Luther C. McKinney, a senior vice president at
the Quaker Oats Co. who addressed the hearing, the first of four
planned around the country.
   ``The public has a lot higher awareness of some of those
relationships and a desire for a lot more knowledge than they
presently have.''
   Industry groups, food companies, and consumer groups lined up
for the Food and Drug Administration's all-day session to discuss
nutrition and ingredient labeling, descriptive terms for food and
health messages.
   Their concerns ranged from preservatives to pesticides to baby
foods to the need for national standards.
   Jan Schakowsky of the Illinois Public Action Group said that in
addition to sodium and cholesterol, the public ``is equally
concerned about the impact of pesticides and other known
carcinogens and reproductive toxins in their food.''
   ``Consumers have an unequivocal right to know if and when they
are exposing ... their families to dangerous chemicals in the food
they eat.''
   Ms. Schakowsky also noted that the Environmental Protection
Agency has failed to establish safe exposure levels for all but a
few of 600 active pesticide ingredients.
   Carol Berland, 51, described before the hearing her sensitivity
to certain preservatives, sometimes used in packaging, which leave
her gasping for breath.
   ``You can actually feel the bones in your body shaking,'' said
Ms. Berland, concerned about the use of claims such as ``all
natural.''
   Speaking for Gerber Products Co., Sandra Bartholmey said the
Fremont, Mich.-based company will work to ensure that infant-food
labels reflect the differences in infant and adult diets.
   She noted the importance of feeding ``your baby like a baby,''
avoiding excessive fiber and recognizing the need for fat and
cholesterol.
   Ms. Bartholmey urged the hearing panel to exempt food for babies
under 2 years old from labeling requirements for these nutrients,
noting such information likely ``will be misleading to many adults
and may lead to a nutritionally inadequate diet.''
   McKinney, speaking for the Washington-based National Food
Processors Association, called for ``national uniformity of
labeling requirements,'' saying they would allow ``a much needed
nationwide nutrition education program that would go hand in hand
with the new labeling rules.''
   An association survey of 1,000 consumers is under way to
determine what consumers want and need in food labeling, McKinney
said.
   ``I believe research will show strong consumer interest in
labeling for fat, cholesterol and sodium content,'' he said.
   Chicago-based Quaker has been involved in an ``oat bran war''
over ads claiming its oat cereal can reduce the risk of heart
disease by helping lower cholesterol. The Federal Trade Commission
cleared Quaker in June, but in September, Texas Attorney General
Jim Mattox sued the company, which filed a countersuit.
   The FDA hearings follow the August introduction in Congress of a
tough new food-labeling bill, the Nutritional Labeling and
Education Act.
   The agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services,
has scheduled additional hearings Nov. 1 in San Antonio, Texas;
Dec. 7 in Seattle, and Dec. 13 in Atlanta.

   The prosecutor in the Iran-Contra
investigation Monday accused Attorney General Dick Thornburgh of
deliberately sidetracking ``with no legitimate reason'' the
criminal case against a former CIA station chief.
   There is ``every reason to proceed promptly'' in the criminal
prosecution of Joseph Fernandez, the CIA's ex-station chief in
Costa Rica, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said in a court
brief.
   Fernandez assisted Oliver North's secret Contra supply network
during a congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the rebel force.
   On Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va., granted the Justice Department's request for a month's time to
consider whether it wants to appeal its ruling that Thornburgh
couldn't intervene in the Fernandez prosecution on secrecy issues.
   Walsh's brief asked the court to reconsider its order.
   Fernandez was scheduled to go on trial in July, but the Justice
Department went to the appeals court after U.S. District Court
Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria, Va., said Fernandez was entitled
to disclose certain government secrets.
   Those include the fact that the CIA has stations in Honduras and
El Salvador.
   Thornburgh has ``repeatedly thwarted'' the prosecution ``by
last-minute, unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie
this case in a knot of endless litigation,'' said Walsh.
   Walsh said Thornburgh ``has asserted no legitimate reason for
delay'' and that ``there is every reason to proceed promptly.''
   Walsh complained that the attorney general provided no notice
that he had decided to file the request for an extension. The
Justice Department and Walsh's office have worked closely on
secrecy issues for three years. In this instance, the Justice
Department mailed Walsh a copy of his request, depriving the
independent counsel of an opportunity to respond before the court
acted, the court papers stated.
   The department's request for the extension was prepared on Oct.
11, the day Justice Department spokesman David Runkel assured
reporters in a memo that ``there are no new developments in the
Fernandez case.''
   Asked last Friday about the discrepancy between his statement
and the department's actions, Runkel said he was unaware that
government lawyers were preparing to file the request for the
extension.
   Walsh said the information Thornburgh seeks to protect ``is
widely known to the public,'' such as the existence of CIA stations
in Latin America. The independent counsel said Thornburgh's only
course in protecting the information is to file an affidavit which
would prohibit its use at Fernandez's trial.
   Such a step could lead to dropping the criminal charges against
the ex-CIA officer, who is accused of obstructing the Tower
Commission and the CIA inspector general's offices and making false
statements.
   In the court papers, Walsh said he was told by Assistant
Attorney General Edward Dennis on Oct. 2 that the Justice
Department probably would not seek further court review. Dennis,
head of the department's criminal division, said that Thornburgh
probably would file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure of the
information at the Fernandez trial, said Walsh.
   In addition, said Walsh, a criminal division attorney indicated
on Oct. 11 that the division had sent a memo to the solicitor
general recommending against seeking further appeals court review.

<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrial average managed a
rebound today, defying fears of a Black Monday-style crash in some
of the heaviest trading in the history of the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The Dow average, which represents stock prices of America's 30
biggest industrial companies, closed 88.12 points higher at
2,657.38, a gain of 3.43 percent or nearly half the loss posted on
Friday.
   The leap came after the average gyrated in early trading,
starting with a decline of about 63 points shortly after the
opening bell.
   Most of the stocks that comprise the Dow average were posting
gains as investors snapped up blue-chip issues. Other stocks lagged
behind.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
recovered its early loss and was up 4.21 to 189.77 at the close.
But Big Board losers led advancing issues by a 5-to-4 margin at the
close with 942 down, 766 down and 286 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones average had plunged 190.58 points on Friday in the
worst decline since the 508-point Black Monday crash of Oct. 19,
1987. Some had feared today would be a rerun of that Monday two
years ago because it had been preceded by a sharp, 100-plus-point
drop in the Dow the previous Friday.
   Analysts were encouraged that the market avoided that scenario,
but said stock prices were still volatile.
   ``Perhaps through the next week or so we will experience a
continued high degree of volatility,'' said Jack Conlon, an
executive vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International.
   After setting a morning sales volume record, trading slowed
somewhat during the afternoon but the final total of 416 million
shares was still easily double the typical day's volume.
   The Big Board's computer system was expanded following the crash
to be able to accommodate 600 million shares a day.
   In Washington, the Federal Reserve made good on its promise to
keep the markets moving by injecting $2 billion into the banking
system. Analysts described the move as restrained.
   The Fed had indicated over the weekend that it would move
quickly to meet any demands for cash that might result from a
deluge of sell orders hitting the U.S. markets.
   Turmoil continued in the airline sector. Donald Trump announced
he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, after the company's stock slid more than $13 a
share. However, he said he would consider lowering his offer.
   Program trading, which exacerbated Friday's decline, worked to
accentuate the market's volatility today.
   ``It's very difficult to tell where we are,'' said Hugh Johnson,
first vice president at First Albany Corp. Bargain-hunting
institutional investors bought high-quality stocks, which helped
push up the Dow, but Johnson said the fact that the broader market
was still off was troublesome.
   Takeover rumors and leveraged buyouts had pushed the stock
market to record heights in recent months. It was trouble with one
of those deals _ the employee-management buyout of United Airines
parent UAL Corp. _ that sparked Friday's sell-off.
   UAL, which ceased trading late Friday, plummeted $55 to $224.75
when it began trading late in the morning.
   Initial Dow readings were complicated because computers were
running behind the heavy trading. Texaco opened at 10:06 a.m. EDT,
the last Dow component to begin trading, Torrenzano said.
   ``We're getting through the initial tremor of the opening,''
said Eugene Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia. ``The market is holding up pretty well; it's not
showing real signs of breaking.''
   But Peroni also cautioned that the market's ``real test will
come later this afternoon when everything is opened and has had a
chance to trade on a normalized basis.''
   Sell orders had been accumulating over the weekend and stock
futures contracts were at a discount to stocks, giving an incentive
for investors to sell stocks and buy futures.
   Stock index futures plunged at the opening in Chicago, creating
a further drag on the stock market in New York. But the futures
later moved into plus territory, helping the stock market recoup
its losses.
   Overseas, where markets reopened for the first time since Wall
Street's Friday the 13th scare, declines registered from moderate
to large in Asia. European markets initially were hit hard but
rebounded somewhat after Wall Street opened.
   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index, down
nearly 200 points at midday, recovered to finish the day down 70.50
points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,163.4 in extremely heavy trading.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues
closed at 34,468.69, down 647.33 points, a drop of 1.8 percent from
Friday, when the index rose 329.97 points. The previous biggest
decline of the year was 484.11 points on Sept. 26.
   The dollar's value sank in early trading today in Europe and in
Tokyo before recovering somewhat.
   Trading in Tokyo was the first opportunity a major foreign
market had to react to Friday's 190-point plunge in the Dow
industrials.
   The trading there and in other major foreign markets had been
expected to set the tone for the activity that resumed later in New
York.
   On Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange opened its computers
to receive orders at 7:30 a.m. EDT, an hour earlier than usual,
because it expected heavy volume. Thousands of worried investors
called sell orders into their brokers over the weekend, setting the
stage for a flood of activity when Wall Street opens for business.

   Amateur radio operators would be hit with
first-ever registration fees under pending deficit reduction
legislation, a slap at people who perform a valuable service when
disaster strikes, Sen. Carl Levin said Monday.
   Senate leaders will try to remove the fees from the bill during
negotiations with the House over the budget and tax package, said
Levin, d-Mich.
   ``These are people who are critically needed in emergencies.
They ask for nothing and they charge nothing,'' Levon said.
   The House and Senate versions of the budget bill would levy a
$35 fee on amateur radio operators, also known as ``ham''
operators, when they receive their initial licenses, which must be
renewed every 10 years.
   That is not much money, acknowledged Perry Williams, spokesman
for the American Amateur Radio League, which represents about
160,000 of the nation's 450,000 licensed ham operators.
   But he said operators would have to pay the fees each time they
upgrade their licenses.
   ``You get kicked in the teeth for advancing your skills,''
Williams said.
   It costs the Federal Communications Commission about $5 to
process each license, Levin said. Higher fees than that ``would be
like taxing a hobby, which doesn't make sense,'' he said.
   Ham operators have played a vital role in disasters such as
earthquakes in Mexico in 1985 and in El Salvador in 1986, the crash
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in 1987 and Hurricane Hugo last
month, Levin said.
   It was they who got word to the U.S. government of the need for
troops to quell looting in the Virgin Islands after Hugo, Williams
said.
   The proposed fees are among provisions that would raise $43
million to cover the FCC's administrative costs in licensing radio
stations, although Levin said it is not clear whose idea it was to
apply the charges to ham operators.
   ``I haven't found anyone who defends it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager was sentenced Monday to life
in prison for using an ax to kill his parents, brother and sister,
a case the judge called ``an extreme and monumental tragedy.''
   David Brom was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in the
deaths of his parents and brother and a concurrent term in the
death of his sister. He will not be eligible for parole for 52{
years.
   Brom had pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness in the
February 1988 slayings at the family's rural Rochester home. He was
16 at the time of the slayings but was tried as an adult.
   A jury found him guilty of four counts of first-degree murder
Oct. 3 _ Brom's 18th birthday. It rejected his insanity defense
Sunday in completing Minnesota's two-part trial system for insanity
pleas.
   Brom was impassive during his entencing Monday by Olmsted County
District Judge Ancy Morse, who said the case was an ``extreme and
monumental tragedy'' caused by a ``pathetically sick, depressed
mind.''
   He declined an opportunity to speak before the court.
   An appeal is automatic.
   During trial, County Attorney Ray Schmitz told jurors that Brom
repeatedly talked to friends about killing his family as part of
``a kind of game.'' Schmitz said Brom admitted the killings in a
conversation with a friend. And he said Brom told a friend he had
an altercation with his father the night of the killings.
   Defense attorney Terrence Walters had agreed that Brom committed
the slayings but argued they were not premeditated, and that Brom
was mentally ill.
   Brom was convicted of killing his parents, Bernard and Paulette,
both 41; his sister, Diane, 13, and brother, Ricky, 11.
   During the trial, five psychiatrists agreed that Brom suffered
from a major mental illness; only one said Brom met Minnesota's
legal standard of insanity.

<HEAD>World Stock Markets Tumble In Response To Friday The 13th</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock markets around the world tumbled Monday as foreigners
reacted to Wall Street's Friday the 13th plunge with a deluge of
sell orders that clogged exchanges from Tokyo to Lisbon.
   ``The general perception is there was a bit of a panic,'' said
Guy Stern, a research analyst at ABD Securities Corp. in New York.
   But analysts said that despite sharp drops in stock prices, the
global backlash was nowhere near what it was two years ago in the
wake of Wall Street's Black Monday collapse.
   Some also said Wall Street's rebound on Monday, which saw the
Dow Jones industrial average rise nearly 90 points, could spark a
similar upturn when foreign exchanges reopened Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the first major market to open following Friday's
abrupt 190-point plunge in the Dow industrial average, the key
225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed some 600 points at the opening,
rallied, and then slumped again to close down 647.33 points _ or
1.8 percent _ at 34,468.69.
   That compared with a record 15 percent Nikkei drop on Oct. 20,
1987, the day after Black Monday. Other Asian markets posted
moderate to large losses.
   Across Europe, trading delays and computer problems stemming
from extremely heavy trading plagued the markets.
   ``Along with Japan going down, the whole continent started to
drop very heavily,'' said Stern.
   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down
by more than 9 percent at one point but recovered to finish at its
high of the day, off 70.5 points, or 3.2 percent, from Friday at
2,163.40.
   Trading was extremely heavy. Volume came to 959.3 million
shares, more than double Friday's volume.
   Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in their
steepest fall ever, with the German Stock Index plunging 12.8
percent in what one Frankfurt dealer called ``a blood bath.''
   Price drops of 15 percent triggered temporary trading
suspensions in many shares in Paris, Brussels and Lisbon _ measures
designed to calm roiled markets. In Paris, dealing was temporarily
suspended twice due to insufficient buying orders.
   A mass of sell orders caused computer problems in Brussels,
where there was little trading all session. Amsterdam also had
computer problems during its session.
   Exchanges in Frankfurt, the Netherlands and elsewhere stayed
open late to compensate for the trading difficulties.
   Some European exchanges considered closing for the day but
decided against it. Several took extra precautions to stem a
freefall. In Milan, for example, traders were prohibited from short
selling, the practice of selling borrowed shares in speculation
they can be bought back later at a lower price.
   ``Things started off more or less the same as two years ago, but
the big difference is that when (trading) came back to New York,
the market had rebounded,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   After gyrating wildly throughout the morning, the Dow average
had moved into plus territory and stabilized, finishing the day up
88.12 at 2,657.38 _ a 3.43 percent gain.
   Analysts predicted that foreign markets would feed off of Wall
Street's Monday gain, just as they reflected last week's decline.
   ``The markets overseas are probably going to rebound strongly as
long as the U.S. market stays fairly stable,'' Stern said.

<HEAD>Cornel Wilde Dies of Leukemia After 50-Year Career</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY12</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cornel Wilde, whose fabled career on the big
screen spanned nearly 50 years and included an Academy Award
nomination for ``A Song To Remember,'' died of leukemia Monday,
just three days after he turned 74.
   Wilde, who had been undergoing treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center since Sept. 2, died with his son, Cornel Wilde Jr., at his
side, said hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia.
   Wilde's career, on the screen and as a producer and director,
included work in more than 50 movies and stretched from 1940 to
1987. In 1945, he was nominated for an Academy Award for his
performance in ``A Song To Remember,'' in which he portrayed
composer Frederic Chopin.
   ``I realized long ago that I could not depend on luck to bring
me success,'' Wilde once said. ``I worked hard, extra hard to
improve my chance by increasing my abilities and my experience. It
was my goal to accomplish, in my life, something of value and to do
it with self-respect and integrity.''
   Wilde was born in New York City on Oct. 13, 1915, and moved a
year later with his parents and sister to Budapest, Hungary, where
his father, a perfume and cosmetic importer, reported for duty as a
captain in a calvary unit.
   In 1920, the senior Wilde obtained passports to return his
family to the United States. In 1931, the son entered Columbia
University as one of its youngest undergraduates. A short time
later, his father's ill health forced the family to return to
Europe for a time.
   Back in the United States and enrolled in a pre-medical
curriculum at Columbia, Wilde became a prospective member of the
1936 U.S. Olympic fencing team. But he chose to drop medicine and
fencing to pursue acting.
   Wilde's swordsmanship came in handy later, though _ especially
in stage roles like that of Tybalt in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' On
screen, he put his talent to use in ``A Thousand and One Nights,''
``At Sword's Point, ``California Conquest'' and ``Condor's Nest.''
   Personally, one of his most successful roles was as the fearless
trapeze artist in Cecil B. De Mille's ``The Greatest Show on
Earth,'' but he was best known for his roles in adventure movies
that included ``The Naked Prey,'' ``High Sierra,'' ``The Bandit of
Sherwood Forest,'' ``Beyond Mombasa,'' ``Omar Khayyam,''
``Constantine and the Cross'' and ``The Fifth Musketeer.''
   The 1955 movie ``The Big Combo,'' which he produced and starred
in, was criticized at the time for what some considered excessive
violence.
   ``You can't get away from violence in drama,'' Wilde responded.
``If you do not have conflict, you do not have drama. If a brutal
scene is shown for no reason except to shock, then it is bad.''
   He also acted in, directed and produced ``Beach Red,'' ``Storm
Fear,'' ``Devil's Hairpin,'' ``Maracaibo,'' ``Sword Of Lancelot,''
and ``Shark's Treasure.'' Wilde's last movie was ``My Very Wilde
Life,'' filmed in 1987.
   Wilde married actress Patricia Knight in 1938. They had a
daughter, Wendy, and divorced in 1951. He married actress Jean
Wallace that year and had a son. He and Miss Wallace were divorced
in 1980.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Hurricane Dissipates While Denver Gets Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The weather system left by the dissipation of Hurricane Jerry
spread across the lower Mississippi Valley on Monday, thunderstorms
spread from the Plains to the Great Lakes, and snow snarled traffic
in Denver.
   The low pressure center which represented what once was the
hurricane that battered Galveston, Texas, on Sunday moved
northeastward out of southwestern Arkansas during Monday afternoon.
Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the lower
Mississippi Valley into the lower Ohio Valley.
   The heaviest precipitation during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
was 1.32 inches at Jonesboro, Ark.
   Thunderstorms associated with the hurricane drenched
east-central Texas and west-central Louisiana with up to 5 inches
of rain.
   A flash flood watch was posted for northern Mississippi and a
flash flood watch was issued through the night for central and
western Tennessee.
   A cold front stretched across the central part of the nation and
showers and thunderstorms developed along it from eastern Kansas to
Lower Michigan. Thunderstorms along that front on Sunday produced
severe weather in Iowa and Wisconsin with gusts to 65 mph at
Winterset, Iowa, and hail as big as golf balls in Wisconsin, the
National Weather Service reported.
   Snow fell over some of the mountains and foothills of Colorado.
Denver had 3 inches of wet, slushy snow by mid afternoon and up to
8 inches accumulated in the surrounding foothills.
   The snow caused traffic snarls for commuters and reduced
visibility at Denver's Stapleton airport, causing flight delays of
up to an hour, said Richard Boulware, airport public information
officer. The number of flights arriving and departing was reduced
to 30 per hour from the average of 80 per hour at midmorning.
   ``Visibility is the problem, not the snow,'' Boulware said.
   Interstate 25 was closed for about an hour five to six miles
south of the Colorado-Wyoming border after a truck overturned on
the slushy surface, patrol officials said.
   Elsewhere, showers extended across central Kansas into eastern
Colorado.
   During the morning, dense fog reduced visibility in New Jersey
and eastern Pennsylvania, parts of Georgia and Florida, and in some
California valleys.
   Morning lows in the teens were reported in Montana, northwestern
Wyoming and northwestern North Dakota, and afternoon temperatures
were only in the 30s in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin,
Upper Michigan and the Rockies.
   At the other extreme, Montgomery, Ala., tied its record high for
the date at 90 degrees.
   Monday's overnight low for the Lower 48 states was 11 at
Broadus, Mont.

   Poverty, unemployment and infant mortality add
up to misery in the lower Mississippi River region, and the remedy
must include help from the federal government, a commission said
Monday.
   The Lower Mississippi River Delta Development Commission
acknowledged the economic ills that burden seven states bordering
the river and said those woes should not prevent the region from
``participating as a full partner in America's future.''
   ``In short, the region is not only worth saving, but because of
its location, resources and climate, could make a major
contribution to the rest of the nation and the world,'' the
commission said.
   The commission was created by Congress in 1988 to come up with a
10-year plan to aid 214 counties near the Mississippi. It did not
offer specific recommendations Monday; those are due in May.
   The commission, however, did address some issues that could get
attention in the final report:
   _Flood control. Local communities are required to pay a 25
percent share of federal flood-control projects.
   ``For some of the poorest counties in the Delta, we should have
no match or at least a much smaller match than 25 percent,'' said
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, the commission chairman.
   _Infant mortality. Support for provision of midwives would
``cost a small amount of federal funds ... and would produce
enormous returns.'' In 1984, the commission said, 14 counties lost
more babies per 1,000 births than Chile, Cuba, Malaysia and French
Guiana.
   _Corporate help. Workers at a Louisiana company had a high
incidence of low-birthweight babies. After a $10,000 program to
educate pregnant women, improvement was dramatic.
   The commission said economic development has been harmed by a
history of racial clashes, which have the fueled a perception of
the Delta as a ``social and political backwater.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said the region's overall problems
represent the ``most pervasive shame of America.''
   ``Yes, we'll ask for some things from the federal government,''
Clinton said, ``but they won't be massive dollar commitments.
   ``We do not expect the national government, given the present
budget realities, to write us a big check. ... We want a
partnership over 10 years with strict accountability for all,'' he
said.
   The states covered by the commission are Arkansas, Louisiana,
Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Mississippi.

<HEAD>Pentagon Suspends Asher Engineering, Cites Evidence of Fraud</HEAD>

   The Navy said Monday it suspended a California
defense contractor from doing business with the government, saying
the company supplied untested circuit boards for tactical missiles.
   If flawed, the suspect boards could keep the missiles from going
off.
   The boards, made by Asher Engineering Corp. of Baldwin Park,
Calif., went into the Navy's Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile,
the Harpoon anti-ship missile, the Harm anti-radar missile,
Tomahawk cruise missile, Sidewinder heat-seeking missile, Sparrow
radar-directed missile and the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air
Missile, the statement said.
   The action was taken against Asher because it did not keep
adequate records of tests to see whether the boards met contract
specifications, the Navy said in a statement issued at the Pentagon.
   The firm made printed wiring boards that were put into arming
switches made by another defense contractor, Micronics
International of Brea, Calif.
   Micronics was the sole source of the arming devices for such
vital missiles as the Phoenix and the AMRAAM, or Advanced
Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile.
   Last month, the Pentagon said it had cut off all purchases of
the items from Micronics, resulting in a delay in the deployment of
some missiles and forcing the Navy to take parts from old missiles
until a new supplier begins production.
   Because of the problems with the parts, the Pentagon said last
month that deployment of new Phoenix missiles to the Navy's fleet
would have to be delayed and cause delays in testing the AMRAAM
aboard Navy F-18 and Air Force F-15 fighters until new parts were
secured from another source.
   But the service insisted that it had ``a full inventory of
missiles for its operational forces to compensate for an expected
stop in deliveries of the safety and arming device.''
   The devices will be produced by Raymond Engineering in
Massachusetts, starting in 1991.
   And the Navy said problems with the boards had not been found to
cause any ``detrimental missile performance.''
   The suspension is temporary, pending the outcome of an
investigation and any resulting legal proceedings, the Navy said.
   Although the boards did not meet contract specficiations,
missile components were tested at other levels when they were built
into the full missile, the Navy said.
   The action against Asher was taken ``based on adequate evidence
that this company and these individuals defrauded the government in
performing subcontracts to manufacture printed wiring boards,'' the
statement said.
   The Navy said Asher Engineering, Badhadursinh Asher, Jayant
Hathi and James Menzies would be barred from contracting with any
agency of the government for the temporary period.
   Each of the individuals named signed certificates saying the
wiring boards were manufactured in accordance with the contract
specifications.
   However, the statement said, ``investigation shows that Asher
Engineering does not have the capability to perform the required
tests in-house and there is no evidence that outside test
facilities were utilized.''
   The arming device, roughly comparable to the safety on a gun, is
built into the missile's fuze to prevent premature firing of the
missile. It also prevents explosions in accidents, such as dropping
a warhead on a carrier deck, but allows the warhead to explode when
it hits a target after being fired.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Agriculture Department eventually will
have to furlough some chicken inspectors and other employees to
reduce spending under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, a
budget official said Monday.
   But Dennis Kaplan, chief of USDA's budget control and analysis
division, said there is widespread belief that ``Congress will pass
some kind of reconciliation'' measure soon that will make the
Gramm-Rudman mandatory cuts, or sequester, unnecessary.
   The department's programs ``are going to go on basically as they
always have over the next couple of weeks ... there'll be no real
impact on programs'' during that time, he said in an interview.
   ``Even if we go through the sequester, you're not going to see
any major impact until toward the end of the year,'' Kaplan said.
   Some USDA agencies that have big payrolls would be hit hard
eventually. The Food Safety and Inspection Service, for example,
which handles federal meat and poultry inspections, ``will probably
furlough a lot of their employees,'' he said. ``But that won't
occur until August or September.''
   Other agencies in a similar boat include the Forest Service,
with its vast organization of regional and lower-echelon offices;
the Farmers Home Administration, including county offices that
service loans for financially pressed farmers; and the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, including its quarantine and
disease-control activities.
   Kaplan said much of USDA's spending is exempt from Gramm-Rudman
cuts, including the vast food stamp, school lunch and other child
nutrition programs.
   Farm price support operations are subject to the Gramm-Rudman
cutback, which averages 5.3 percent for domestic agencies, or about
$8.1 billion. Defense cuts also must total $8.1 billion, or 4.3
percent.
   After deducting all the exempted programs from USDA's projected
spending for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, the base used for the
cuts is about $9.59 billion, Kaplan said. The 5.3 percent
Gramm-Rudman reduction would amount to around $509 million.
   Two years ago, in another Gramm-Rudman round that was later
rolled back by Congress, USDA underwent an 8.5 percent pruning of a
base exceeding $8.25 billion, meaning a reduction of around $702
million.

   A car bomb wrecked the Vanguardia
Liberal newspaper building in northeastern Colombia on Monday and
killed four employees of the paper, which had joined in a
condemnation of cocaine barons.
   Reports said a soldier helped a drug trafficking suspect wanted
in the United States escape from a hospital in Barranquilla.
   The newspaper's publisher blamed drug traffickers for the
bombing in Bucaramanga, a city of 400,000 people 175 miles north of
Bogota. He said he did not know whether the paper could continue
publishing.
   The Vanguardia Liberal is the main daily of northeastern
Colombia.
   ``Although I can't identify the perpetrators, I can say that,
basically, they are the same group of drug traffickers that have
carried out these types of attacks in the past,'' Alejandro Galvis
Ramirez said in a radio interview.
   Vanguardia is a member of Colombia's main newspaper association,
which recently condemned the drug gangs.
   ``Right now we're evaluating the extent of the damage'' to see
if the paper can be published, Galvis said on the Caracol radio
network. ``We don't yet know if the machines are still functioning
or even if we have electricity.''
   Four journalists were assassinated by unidentified gunmen last
week in the cities of Medellin and Monterria. Medellin is the base
of the most notorious cocaine cartel.
   Drug traffickers claimed responsibilty for killing two of the
journalists, both from El Espectador, a crusader against the drug
gangs.
   The attack on Vanguardia was the second major bombing of a
newspaper since the government began a crackdown on drug
traffickers Aug. 19.
   A car bomb seriously damaged the El Espectator offices in Bogota
last month. The paper's directors have said since that it is near
bankruptcy.
   Journalists at the paper blamed traffickers enraged by its
editorial campaign against them.
   Jose Domingo Caceres, a Vanguardia editor reached by telephone
in Bucaramanga about Monday's bombing, said 110-130 pounds of
dynamite were packed into a Renault. He said the explosion at 6:10
a.m. killed a night watchman, a maintenance worker and two
deliverymen.
   Col. Jorge Ernest Ferrero, a police commander in the city, said
in an interview with Caracol that seven people were injured.
   He said the car was parked outside the modern structure housing
Vanguardia, and the bombers fled in another car. No arrests have
been made.
   Caceres said the explosion brought down the roof of the
three-story building and severely damaged computers, printing
equipment and administrative and editorial offices.
   Ferrero said 15 houses were damaged, some as far away as three
blocks, and three homes facing the newspaper building were
destroyed.
   Damage was estimated initially at $1.2 million, but authorities
said a final estimate would not be available for days.
   El Espectador was distributed Monday in Medellin under military
protection.
   In a telephone call to El Espectador after the killings Oct. 10,
a man claiming to represent the Extraditables, a group linked to
the Medellin cartel, said the paper's remaining staff members in
the city would be killed unless its Medellin office was closed.
   Bruce Gelb, director of the U.S. Information Agency, said during
a visit to the paper Sunday that foreign publishers had pledged $1
million to help El Espectador.
   Drug traffickers killed Guillermo Cano, then the publisher, in
1986. Gelb said his visit to the paper had convinced him of ``the
need for action by the international community to help the
Colombian press defend its freedom.''
   An association of Colombian journalists, the Reporters Club, has
reported 40 newspaper employees killed in Colombia since 1977. It
says many were victims of drug traffickers, but that no precise
breakdown is available.
   Barranquilla's El Heraldo newspaper quoted Gen. Juan Salcedo
Mora, brigade commander in the city, as saying drug suspect Carlos
Humberto Gomez Zapata escaped Sunday in a military uniform. Salcedo
was quoted as saying Cpl. Carlos Carrillo also fled.
   Two national radio chains also reported the escape. Calls by The
Associated Press to brigade headquarters in Barranquilla were not
answered.
   Gomez was admitted to the hospital last week for treatment of an
appendicitis. Authorities notified him of pending extradition to
the United States, where he was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Miami, and were preparing to move him to a Bogota jail, the
newspaper El Tiempo reported Sunday.
   He was captured Sept. 21 in a police raid on an apartment in the
port city.
   President Virgilio Barco's government has extradited four drug
figures _ three men and a woman _ since the crackdown began. Gomez
is accused in a 1984 indictment of masterminding a ring that
shipped tons of methaqualone from West Germany and Austria to the
United States through Panama and Colombia.

   Jan P. Syse became Norway's prime minister
on Monday, acknowledging he had a tough job ahead as leader of a
minority coalition.
   King Olav V officially installed Syse's three-party,
non-socialist Cabinet of 11 men and eight women as Gro Harlem
Brundtland's Labor government handed over power after 3{ years.
   Syse's coalition of his own Conservative Party and the Christian
People's and Center parties controls 62 seats in the 165-member
legislature. Labor and its allied Socialist Left party have 80
seats. The right-wing Party of Progress holds the balance of power
with 22 seats. There is one independent.
   ``We must always have in mind that this is a minority
government,'' said Syse, a 58-year-old lawyer, as he left the royal
palace.
   ``It may be a difficult situation, but we will keep good
relations with all parties outside the government.''
   Syse said he was optimistic his government could live out its
four-year term. ``There are no clear alternatives for another
government,'' he said.
   Looking up at the light drizzle, he added, ``Rain means luck.''
   Mrs. Brundtland and her Cabinet were bid farewell at the palace
two hours earlier.
   She said she would not immediately try to bring down Syse's
coalition.
   ``We'll have to give them a chance to show what they have in
mind,'' she said.
   Political analysts have voiced doubts about the coalition's
ability to survive. A similar ruling minority alliance fell in 1986
over a tax proposal, opening the door for Mrs. Brundtland. She set
a precedent by naming women to nearly half the Cabinet posts.
   Mrs. Brundtland will become Labor's floor leader in Parliament
and may head the legislature's Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Eight ministers besides Syse are from his Conservative Party.
His junior coalition partners, the Christian People's Party and the
Center Party, each was given five portfolios.
   The Finance Ministry went to Conservative Arne Skauge, a
41-year-old economist who held the same post in the previous
non-socialist cabinet.
   Per Ditlev-Simonsen, 57, an experienced politician who majored
in economy and history at Stanford University in California, was
named defense minister.
   Kjell Magne Bondevik, 42, leader of the Christian People's
Party, was named foreign minister and Johan J. Jacobsen, 52, head
of the agrarian-based Center Party, took over the Ministry of
Municipal Affairs.
   The youngest minister appointed was Kristin Clement, 32, the
minister of labor and wage affairs.
   Syse appointed diplomat Tom Vraalsen, now ambassador to the
United Nations, as minister of development aid under the Foreign
Ministry.

   The remnants of small but deadly
Hurricane Jerry blew out of Texas and into Louisiana and Arkansas
on Monday after causing scattered damage estimated at less than $10
million.
   At least two people were killed.
   The small storm grew unexpectedly from a tropical storm to a
hurricane early Sunday and roared ashore with wind gusting to 100
mph, toppling trees and power lines, tearing up roofs and
shattering windows in cars and residences.
   Cleanup crews began collecting downed tree limbs and debris
Monday and the city of some 62,000 southeast of Houston quickly was
returning to normal.
   All but one of the city's schools were open Monday. That school
was closed because of a power failure.
   Mayor Jan Coggeshall said the city would not seek a disaster
declaration from the governor.
   ``We've had much more serious storms. But for the people who did
have damage, it was very serious for them,'' the mayor said.
   Initial damage estimates ranged as high as $25 million, but Mrs.
Coggeshall said that after an aerial survey and ground inspection
by city officials, damage was put at $5 million to $8.25 million.
   ``We don't think it's as serious as Alicia,'' she said,
referring to the 1983 hurricane which caused hundreds of millions
of dollars in damage.
   Some 75,000 Houston Lighting &amp; Power customers were without
electricity at the height of the storm. Most power was restored
Monday.
   After slamming into the island community of Galveston, the storm
drove up the Houston Ship Channel, crumpling four Houston Lighting
&amp; Power transmission towers built to withstand 90 mph wind.
Although customers were not affected seriously by the collapse of
the towers, traffic on the ship channel was halted by the downed
wires and the channel likely would be closed until Tuesday, utility
spokeswoman Geri Konigsberg said.
   Most Galveston residents decided to stay in their homes behind
the seawall instead of evacuating. No mandatory evacuations were
ordered, although a curfew was in effect overnight to discourage
looting.
   Several hundred residents who sought protection in shelters were
allowed to return home Sunday night.
   The hurricane barely brushed Louisiana but it stirred up enough
waves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of Grand Isle,
La., a barrier island and popular resort community.
   Grand Isle Mayor Andy Valence said wind was light and tides were
only about 2.3 feet above normal, but more than 4 feet of beach was
eroded in some areas.
   ``We had to get in touch with a couple of the camp owners to
have them come down and perhaps shore up some of the building
sections,'' said Valence.
   At least six tornadoes accompanied the hurricane, which was
downgraded to a tropical storm at 11 p.m. Sunday with winds at 45
mph. By 5 a.m. Monday, the National Weather Service reduced the
storm again to a tropical depression. The tornadoes caused mostly
roof and powerline damage.
   By midday Monday, the storm was moving through northern
Louisiana and into Arkansas with forecasters warning of 3 to 5
inches of rain and possible tornadoes. During the afternoon, the
low pressure center that once was the hurricane was moving
northeastward out of southwestern Arkansas and showers and
thunderstorms were scattered across the lower Mississippi Valley
into the lower Ohio Valley.
   The only fatalities were a 26-year-old Coast Guardsman and his
2-year-old daughter, whose bodies were found on the rock jetties of
Galveston's protective seawall. They were in a pickup that
apparently got blown off the seawall, Detective Sgt. Leo Singleton
said Monday.
   A third person was believed to have been in the pickup but had
not been found, police said.

<TEXT>
   Jan P. Syse, who became Norway's prime
minister on Monday, is a bright, witty, eloquent and capable lawyer
who calls himself just a boy from the country.
   But many easygoing Norwegians view him as a bit too polished and
urbane.
   Standing for the first time as party leader in an election, Syse
failed to galvanize the electorate and his Conservative Party came
out of the Sept. 11 vote with its worst showing in 20 years.
   But Syse patched together the three centrist non-socialist
parties in a coalition to replace Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labor
government, which also experienced its worst election since World
War II.
   The contrast between the two leaders in the public mind goes
deeper than politics.
   Mrs. Brundtland is known abroad as a stateswoman,
environmentalist and champion of women's rights. In Norway, she is
simply known as Gro.
   The new prime minister is normally referred to as Syse _ proper
but formal.
   The 58-year-old attorney usually appears controlled, measured
and reserved. Mrs. Brundtland, a 50-year-old physician and
Harvard-educated public health specialist, has a fiery temper but
also will openly show grief.
   ``Syse is an excellent speaker, philosphical and funny. He is a
relatively moderate politician,'' said Bernt Ole Aardal, of the
Institute for Social Research.
   Syse became chairman of Norway's second largest party upon the
sudden death of Rolf Presthus in January 1988, when the party was
in the midst of a structuring crisis. He had little time to
establish his leadership before the elections, Aardal noted.
   Critics call Syse a tough and clever politician, strong on
law-and-order and moral issues. But he is burdened with his image.
   ``He is seen as what Norwegians would call too Oslo West,
meaning that he's from the wealthy part of town, very high society
and implying that he is above other people,'' said Aardal.
   Born on Nov. 25, 1930, Syse was in fact raised on the pastoral
island of Notteroey, south of Oslo. He stresses his rural
upbringing, even after almost 40 years in the capital.
   ``I really have trouble comprehending this resilient myth that
I'm so urbane,'' said Syse. ``I am a country boy from Noetteroey.''
   But his heavy-rimmed glasses, flawless diction and rigid posture
enhance the image of an intellectual. An Oslo newspaper joked that
Syse would wear a tie with his towel in Parliament's sauna.
   Syse's quest for a folksier image has sometimes backfired.
   He invited news media to record him fishing from a trawler this
summer and ended up with a giant hook through his finger, removed
in a highly publicized effort involving a hacksaw and pliers.
   The son of a dentist-local politician and his school principal
wife, Syse was politically active early on and was elected chairman
of the Conservative Students Association in 1952. He earned a law
degree from the University of Oslo in 1957.
   He began his career as a lawyer for a shipowner, later working
in non-political, upper-echelon government jobs. He married teacher
Else Walstad in 1959 and has two sons, one who also is a politician.
   He trod a familiar path through party ranks, and was elected to
Parliament in 1973.
   Political scientist Gunnar Vogt said Syse may prove to be a
surprisingly strong leader, as demonstrated by his ability to
stitch together a coalition from three deeply divided parties _ the
Conservatives, the Christian People's Party and the Center Party.
   Mrs. Brundtland, became Norway's first woman prime minister in
1981 and, at 44, its youngest. Her first term lasted seven months.
   She returned to power in May 1986 and gained international
stature as head the U.N. World Commission on the Environment and
Development. Norwegians prefer her international record to her
domestic one.
   Mrs. Brundtland quickly set some new rules. Eight of the 18
Cabinet ministers were women, and her Labor Party made it a rule
that each sex must have at least 40 percent of all party positions.
   Syse's 19-member Cabinet also has eight women.

   Capitol police arrested 55 protesters Monday
after they blocked the entrance to a House office building,
disrupted a House session and staged demonstrations in two
congressional offices to protest U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   About 200 demonstrators rallied outside the Capitol, then
marched to the Rayburn House Office Building carrying banners
denouncing right-wing death squads and U.S. aid to El Salvador.
   Forty-four of the demonstrators then stationed themselves in
front of one entrance to the building and chanted, ``70,000 dead _
no more, U.S. out of El Salvador!'' until they were surrounded by
police and arrested.
   One protestor sustained a bloody nose during the arrests, but
there were no other injuries, said Capitol Police spokesman Dan
Nichols.
   At about the same time, two other small groups of demonstrators
disrupted the offices of Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., by chanting and reading in loud voices.
Four protesters were arrested in each office, Nichols said. Neither
lawmaker was present during the protests.
   And later, three demonstrators began chanting in the House
visitors gallery during a vote. Republican lawmakers cheered when
Capitol Police dragged them from the gallery.
   The protests were sponsored by the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador, which opposes the Central American
country's rightist government and supports the leftist Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front rebels.
   The action coincided with the opening of talks in San Jose,
Costa Rica, aimed at arranging a cease-fire in El Salvador's
decade-long civil war.
   A foreign aid bill that includes $85 million in military aid to
El Salvador is scheduled to go to a House-Senate conference
committee as early as this week.
   Supporters of the aid contend that it is needed to demonstrate
U.S. confidence in Alfredo Cristiani, newly elected president of
the rightist Arena party. Opponents say conditions should be placed
on the aid to ensure that activities of right-wing death squads are
curtailed.

   Members of Congress who sided consistently
against a strong clean air bill during a recent series of committee
votes each received on average $73,430 in campaign contributions
from groups opposed to the legislation, an advocacy group said
Monday.
   The Public Interest Research Group, which frequently supports
environmental groups, said those contributions were nearly four
times as great as the average contributed by the same organizations
_ $19,765 _ to members who voted consistently for toughening the
proposed bill.
   The environmental group said it compared a series of five key
votes on the clean air legislation in the House health and
environment subcommittee with campaign contributions to
subcommittee members over the last eight years. The contributions
were from political action committees, or PACs, representing
interests that have lobbied against strong clean air legislation.
   The subcommittee last week unanimously approved a clean air
bill, but only after a number of close votes on amendments dealing
with critical details of the bill. The legislation has yet to be
considered on the House floor.
   According to the PIRG analysis, 11 members of the subcommittees
who voted against pro-environmental positions on five amendments
each received an average of $73,430 in contributions from the PACs
examined. The nine congressmen who in each case voted in favor of
pro-environmental positions received on average $19,765 from the
same PACs, said the PIRG.
   Among the subcommittee members, those receiving the largest
amount of money from the PACs examined were Rep. Ralph Hall,
D-Texas, $143,000; Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., $134,195; and Rep.
Jack Fields, R-Texas, $121,755.
   Hall and Fields were sponsors of pro-oil industry amendments to
the clean air bill. They and Dingell were key in pushing through
the subcommittee an amendment that scuttled by a 12-10 vote a
provision that would require automakers to build up to 1 million
alternative-fueled cars by 1997.
   The auto and oil industries had lobbied against the
alternative-fueled cars provision.
   At the same time, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., sponsor of a
series of amendments aimed at strengthening the legislation,
received $8,600 in contributions over the eight years from the same
PACs, the environmental group said.
   The contributions were reported to the Federal Election
Commission by more than 60 PACs representing interests including
the National Automobile Dealers Association, the Big Three
automakers, oil and coal companies, electric utilities, and the
chemical industry.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says Claim of Attempt to Murder Him Was a Joke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the national
legislature Monday an investigation was made into a purported
attempt to drown maverick Communist Boris Yeltsin, and Yeltsin said
on state TV that it was all a joke.
   The formal report to the Supreme Soviet legislature, which was
televised on national TV, was the latest twist in the tale of
Yeltsin, a highly popular politician who pokes fun at the Soviet
elite.
   Rumors that Yeltsin died were rampant in Moscow when he
disappeared from public view for two weeks shortly after being
accused in print of drinking and shopping his way through an
American speaking tour. But Yeltsin reappeared on Sunday and told a
rally he'd been recovering from a cold.
   Bakatin told the Supreme Soviet that Yeltsin had reported to a
policeman that he had been assaulted and thrown into the Moscow
River with a bag over his head. Yeltsin supposedly escaped but
asked the policeman not to report the incident.
   Investigation proved this untrue, Bakatin said. For example, he
said, no one could have fallen 50 feet into 5 feet of water at the
bridge in question without suffering injuries.
   Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30, two days after the alleged
incident, that the policeman misunderstood a joke. On Monday, he
had to tell the Supreme Soviet and the entire nation.
   The official Tass news agency said, ``Mikhail Gorbachev, who
presided over the afternoon session, said the need to clear up the
matter was caused by political speculations in connection with the
alleged attempt.''
   Bakatin said the report showed Yeltsin told police at 11:10 p.m.
on Sept. 28 that he let his driver go two hours earlier, about a
third of a mile from his home, and was walking the rest of the way.
   ``Yeltsin said that a car overtook him and unknown persons made
him get into the car, pulled a bag over his head and, on reaching a
bridge across the Moscow River, threw him into the water.
   ``Yeltsin said he managed to reach the bank, rested to regain
his breath and then turned to the militia. However, he asked the
militia people not to let anyone know what had happened,''
according to the Tass account.
   ``Noting that the militia men had no right to withhold the
report, Bakatin said that legal action was started to establish the
objective circumstances behind the statement made by Yeltsin as it
referred to a criminal case involving an attempt on a person's life.
   ``The investigation established that the circumstances contained
in the statement by Boris Yeltsin could not be confirmed.''
   It said Yeltsin told Bakatin on Sept. 30 ``in a person-to-person
talk that there ... had been no attempt on his life. ... The
criminal case was called off.''
   ``In his address, Deputy Yeltsin reiterated that there had been
no attempt on his life,'' Tass said.

   Curious tourists, scraggly anarchists screaming
``Sell today, jump tomorrow!'' and a man handing out free antacid
tablets turned the streets around the cavernous New York Stock
Exchange into a spectacle Monday.
   Inside, frenzied traders sweated through hair-rising price
swings.
   ``It's just crazy,'' said a blue-jacketed exchange worker who
identified himself only as Billy, stepping out for a smoke while
the Dow Jones industrial average bounced around in some of the
heaviest trading in history.
   The best-known stock barometer of 30 stocks gyrated wildly and
finished with an 88.12 point gain, erasing nearly half its
190.58-point drop of last Friday.
   The rebound helped the market avert another Black Monday like
Oct. 19, 1987, when the average tumbled a record 508 points.
   The ``Big Board,'' as the NYSE is known in Wall Street parlance,
decided to keep its visitors' gallery closed, deploying its
tan-uniformed sentries at all entrances. But that didn't stop
scores of curious tourists from coming down to the exchange
building, hoping for a glimpse inside.
   ``I've got some money in there, too, so that makes it more
exciting,'' said Robert Overton, 21, of Chapel Hill, N.C., an
accounting major in his senior year at the University of North
Carolina. He expressed optimism.
   ``It crashed two years ago and it really didn't hurt the
economy,'' he said. ``Business is going to be in business, no
matter what happens today.''
   Others weren't so sanguine. John Egan, 24, a New Yorker with a
couple of hours to kill, said, ``I feel like I'm watching a car
accident.''
   As on previous occasions when the stock market has made big
news, protesters flocked to Wall Street. About a dozen police
officers, some on horseback and others on motorcycles, deployed
themselves nearby.
   ``Down with the Dow, revolution now,'' read a placard held by a
black-scarved man in a group of anarchist-squatters who've been
camped out in a local park.
   ``Watch out for falling stockbrokers!'' they chanted. ``Whether
it crashes today, tomorrow, or next week, isn't the question,''
said one member of the group, who identified himself as John Squat.
``It's the fundamental economy we're talking about.''
   Laura Januzzi, a 26-year-old tourist from Cincinnati, said,
``Where there's dead meat, there's the flock.''
   Perhaps the most enterprising spectator was a man wearing a
Maalox T-shirt, giving away free samples of the antacid from a tub
he carried. ``Maalox sir?'' he asked passersby.

<TEXT>
   Argentina and Britain begin talks Tuesday
on restoring diplomatic relations, broken in 1982 by a 74-day war
over the bleak, windswept Falkland Islands that cost nearly 1,000
lives.
   Neither side would comment on the talks set for Tuesday and
Wednesday, but a joint statement issued Aug. 18 said both sought
``normalization of relations and the furtherance of their mutual
interests in peace and stability in the South Atlantic.''
   The agenda of the closed negotiations in Madrid is expected to
center on renewal of consular ties and air and sea links.
   Argentina is expected to seek an end to the 150-mile exclusion
zone Britain has imposed around the islands, which keeps Argentine
boats out of rich fishing grounds 300 miles off its coast.
   Spanish diplomats said Argentina probably would call for a
reductions in the 2,000-man military force Britain has kept in the
islands since the war. The Argentines invaded the Falklands, which
they claim and call the Malvinas, on April 2, 1983.
   Indirect relations have been handled through a British interests
section at the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires and an Argentine
interests section at Brazil's embassy in London.
   Argentina's delegation to the Madrid talks is led by roving
Ambassador Lucio Garcia del Solar. Leading negotiations for Britain
is its U.N. ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell.
   Sovereignty over the 200-island archipelago is not an issue
because President Carlos Menem dropped the Argentine insistence
that its claim to the British colony be the first issue considered
in a discussion of normal relations.
   An attempt at talks in March 1984 in Bern, Switzerland,
foundered over sovereignty.
   Although the Argentine invasion force surrendered on June 14,
1982, no formal end to hostilities has been declared.
   When the joint communique was issued Aug. 18, at U.N.
headquarters in New York, Garcia del Solar said he felt hostilities
ended in 1982 and no formal declaration to normalize relations was
necessary.
   Most of the 1,900 Falklanders, whose economic mainstays are
sheep-ranching and fishing, are descendants of British sailors.
   The islands were believed sighted in 1592 by the English
navigator John Davis. The British established a naval base at what
is now Saunders Island in 1765, then the Spanish drove them out in
1770.
   Louis-Antoine de Bougainville of France established the first
settlement in 1764 and named it Les Malouines, because most of his
crewmen were from the French port of St. Malo. Spain later bought
out the French.
   Argentina bases its claim on the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, in
which Spain and Portugal settled New World territorial disputes and
agreed on Spanish possession of the Falklands, to which Argentina
succeeded after independence in 1816.
   A British warship regained control of the islands for Britain in
1833 without firing a shot.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Favors New Legislation for Soviet Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Monday he
will support new legislation that could admit 30,000 more Soviet
Jews a year to the United States than allowed by immigration quotas.
   American officials said last month that 70,000-80,000 Soviets
could enter the United States next year, but they expect 300,000
applications as more citizens of all nationalities seek to leave
the Soviet Union.
   Thornburgh, the first U.S. attorney general to visit the Soviet
Union, met with Soviet Jewish activists to calm their fears that
new U.S. quotas would force emigrants to go elsewhere.
   Under rules effective Oct. 1, Soviet Jews no longer can leave
the country with visas for Israel, then apply in Vienna or Rome for
refugee status in the United States.
   When the new regulations were announced, thousands of Jews and
Armenians went to the U.S. Embassy seeking explanations and
application forms.
   Jewish activist Leonid D. Stonov, 50, told Thornburgh
anti-Semitism was growing in the Soviet Union and the new rules
should be eased.
   ``Jewish emigration is now more on the order of an evacuation,''
Stonov, who has tried to leave for 10 years, said in a meeting with
Thornburgh at the U.S. Embassy.
   Soviet Jewish emigration has increased dramatically under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, from 8,000 in 1987 to 19,000 last
year and a projected 35,000 in 1989. Non-Jewish emigration this
year is expected to reach 15,000.
   Thornburgh said he understood the concerns of Soviet Jews and
would support proposed legislation allowing President Bush to raise
the Soviet quota by 30,000 a year for five years.
   ``We have urged that the Congress act ... so it will act
somewhat as a safety valve for the conditions you describe,''
Thornburgh told the activists.
   An aide said most of those getting special emigration status
probably would be Soviet Jews.
   Thornburgh arrived Sunday for a five-day visit.

   President Bush's plan to curb chemical weapons
raised concerns in Congress on Monday and may anger other nations
because it could affect a multilateral pact already partially
negotiated.
   The changes apparently would give the United States the right to
continue producing chemical weapons after the treaty was signed,
and would allow the United States to maintain a portion of its
stockpile until all nations capable of making chemical weapons sign
the proposed treaty.
   The shift ``is going to cause a little commotion in the
negotiations,'' said an administration arms control expert who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It will cause us difficulties in
Geneva,'' where the multilateral negotiations are under way.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that ``unless
the president clarifies his position on this issue _ makes a
decision and makes it known _ it is likely that little progress
will be made in Geneva toward achieving the multilateral treaty
prohibiting chemical weapons which the president, ironically, has
stated is one of his highest priorities.''
   Bush, as vice president in 1984, carried a draft text to the
Geneva negotiations proposing that nations signing a chemical
weapons ban cease producing such arms right away and destroy their
stockpiles over a 10-year period. About 40 nations are taking part
in those talks, which resume in November.
   On Sept. 25, Bush proposed in a speech to the United Nations
that the United States and the Soviet Union cut their existing
chemical stockpiles by 80 percent as an impetus to the Geneva
negotiations.
   But Bush has also signed a classified order allowing the
Pentagon to continue producing a new generation of chemical weapons
for an unspecified period of time, according to administration
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It is the unannounced and unexplained shift on the production of
chemicals weapons that critics say will stimulate rather than curb
chemical weapons proliferation.
   Although Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze immediately
applauded Bush's U.N. speech, the Kremlin is concerned over the
classified order to continue production of a new generation of
chemical weapons, said a Soviet diplomat.
   ``There is some controvery over this,'' said the Soviet diplomat
who spoke on condition he not be further identified. Administration
officials discussed the U.N. speech with Shevardnadze beforehand,
``but we were not told about the continued production'' said the
diplomat.
   Members of Congress are urging the president to explain and
reconsider his shift.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, called Bush's stance a ``major step
backward.''
   ``Timidity, mixed signals, inconsistent statements _ all of
which is what has been coming from the administration _ could
result in the loss of an historic opportunity to prevent the spread
of chemical arsenals around the world,'' Mitchell said in a Senate
speech.
   The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., said on Oct. 12 that he was disturbed by ``the
conflicting statements that are coming out from the administration
concerning continued chemical weapons production and a treaty.''
   Another congressman, Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., on the same day
called the new stance ``a very serious reversal in George Bush's
historic position. It is a very serious reversal in our national
position. Clearly, it opens the door to other countries that want
to get in under the wire and commence production.''
   The change in position was pushed by Pentagon officials, who
want to continue to produce a new generation of chemical weapons,
said the administration source.
   The new weapons are called binary arms, because they consist of
two non-lethal substances that become deadly when mixed.
   The Pentagon, said the adminisration official, was concerned
over delays in production of the ``Bigeye,'' a bomb that would
contain the binary chemicals for delivery by airplanes.
   Asked to explain the Pentagon position, spokeswoman Maj. Kathy
Wood, read a statement that said: ``In order to ensure that the
small remaining stockpile that will be destroyed last under the
comprehensive treaty is safe and effective, we will continue to
produce binary weapons. Of course, the binary program would be
restructured as necessary to stay within the timing and limits of
the U.S. chemical weapons stocks as outlined by the president.''
   Bush, in his Sept. 25 speech, threw in another provision that
one critic called ``a treaty stopper,'' that the United States
would not eliminate the final 2 percent of its chemical weapons
until all nations capable of producing such arms implement the pact.
   That provision means the United States would hold about 500 tons
of its chemical weapons in reserve, according to administration
officials.
   Elisa D. Harris, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, called Bush's position ``a sharp change'' because it
implies that those nations with chemical stockpiles would be
allowed to keep some of them as a deterrent.
   Although the U.S. government does not disclose the exact extent
of its chemical weapons stockpile, outside analysts say they figure
is 32,000 tons, and administration officials said that is roughly
accurate.

   The House on Monday commended the government
and people of Colombia for ``tremendous courage and fortitude in
standing up to the atrocities'' of drug traffickers.
   In a 348-0 vote, the House approved a resolution that urged the
Bush administration to continue to provide support ``in terms of
equipment, training, intelligence and financial assistance'' to
help the South American country fight the illegal drug trade.
   The resolution, which now goes to the Senate for a vote,
commends President Virgilio Barco and ``expresses to the government
and people of Colombia the support, respect and empathy of the
Congress and the people of the United States in this most difficult
time.''
   The assassinations of presidential candidate Juan Carlos Galan
and other high-ranking officials have been blamed on drug lords,
along with the deaths of 200 Colombian judges, 11 Supreme Court
justices and four counsels of state.
   Thousands of others, including mayors, law enforcement officers,
public officials, journalists, lawyers and doctors also have died
in the drug wars which have included the bombing of public places
and offices.
   The House said drug dealers ``are exporting their terror by
smuggling the illegal, deadly drug concaine into the United States,
Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.''

   The head of the biggest
far-right political party said Monday there would be ``chaos and
conflict'' if the government allows freed black nationalist leaders
to pursue militant opposition activity.
   Andries Treurnicht of the segregationist Conservative Party, who
won 31 percent of the white vote in last month's parliamentary
elections, said the government had undermined its own ban on the
African National Congress guerrilla movement by freeing seven ANC
leaders unconditionally.
   The seven, at a news conference after their release Sunday, said
they would intensify pressure on the government to legalize the
ANC, lift the state of emergency and release all political
prisoners as preconditions for talks.
   Anti-apartheid groups said Monday that 71 people remained
detained without charge nationwide and that six of them had begun a
hunger strike to press for their release.
   Treurnicht, in a statement, said: ``Either the government
dispossesses us (whites) of our country ... by giving in to the ANC
ultimatum, or the government disallows further demonstrations and
rejects all radical claims which will disturb the peace, destroy
freedom and land the country in a situation of chaos and conflict.''
   The seven ANC leaders, freed along with a member of a smaller
guerrilla group, kept a low profile Monday after their emotional
news conference Sunday.
   Walter Sisulu, the highest-ranking of the group and a close
friend of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela, spent most of the day
at his home in Soweto. He emerged at one point to greet several
hundred schoolchildren gathered outside, telling them they should
work hard at school and maintain discipline in their political
activities.
   The only freed prisoners not aligned to the ANC, Jafta Masemola,
held a news conference in Pretoria to convey the position of his
organization, the Pan Africanist Congress.
   He said his group, unlike the ANC, opposed negotiations with the
government because it doubted blacks could gain power this way. He
said anti-government violence remained one of his group's tactics.
   The ANC's 28-year-old campaign of sabotage and bombings has
virtually ceased in recent months, although Sisulu and his
colleagues said they still support the principle of violent
resistance.
   ``We're not concerned about rhetoric,'' said Con Botha, a
spokesman for the governing National Party, when asked about the
freed prisoners' remarks.
   In the past, the government has said it would include the ANC in
negotiations only if its leaders repudiated violence. But South
Africa's ambassador to Britain, Rae Killen, was quoted in
newspapers Monday as telling a British radio interviewer there no
longer were any preconditions.
   The state South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary,
said the ANC's concept of armed struggle ``belongs to a past
political era.''
   ``Today, the doors are open to all political leaders who are
willing to take part in peaceful, democratic action,'' it said.
``Participation in the negotiation process must be comprehensive,
involving authentic leaders of constituencies across the political
spectrum, from left to right.''
   The prisoner releases were approved by President F.W. de Klerk
as part of his attempt to launch negotiations on a new constitution
that will extend political rights to blacks. He envisions an
arrangement that protects white interests and avoids black-majority
rule.
   The 28 million blacks now have no vote in national affairs,
which are dominated by the 5 million whites.
   All but one of the eight freed prisoners served at least 25
years in jail. Five, including Sisulu, were sentenced to life
prison terms in 1964, along with Mandela, for plotting
anti-government sabotage.
   Mandela, 71, remains imprisoned, although his release is widely
expected within months.

<HEAD>State Department Urges PLO To Support Talks With Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department urged the Palestine
Liberation Organization on Monday to authorize talks with Israel
``if we are ever to get the (negotiating) process off the ground.''
   At the same time, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the Bush
administration was not fazed by criticism of its strategy by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Specifically, Shamir objected to having Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak select the Palestinians for the talks and to holding the
session in Cairo.
   ``We are not upset, we do not think it is a step backwards,''
Ms. Tutwiler said of Shamir's statements to the Israeli newspaper
Ma`ariv.
   She said Secretary of State James A. Baker III would keep
working with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmet
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt to get negotiations started.
   But her criticism of the PLO was clear.
   ``If we are ever to get the process off the ground, Palestinians
are going to have to find a way to respond positively,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   The PLO Central Council, at the end of a two-day meeting in
Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday rejected Baker's plan and said the PLO
alone has the right to decide who should talk to Israel.
   A declaration by the Central Council accused the Bush
administration of ignoring the PLO as the ``sole legitimate
representative'' of the Palestinians. It said the American
proposals were only a version of the Israeli peace plan.
   Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, met last
Friday with PLO officials. Mubarak, meanwhile, is acting as a
middle-man between Baker and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   PLO approval is considered essential before any Palestinians
would negotiations with Israel.
   Baker is working on a plan to have Palestinians and Israelis
meet in Cairo on Shamir's proposal for an election on the West Bank
and in Gaza.
   The elected Palestinians then would negotiate limited self-rule
with Israel, to be followed after five years by negotiations for an
overall Middle East settlement.
   The PLO has denounced the proposal as a ploy to prevent
establishment of a Palestinian state on Israeli-held territory.
   On another subject, Ms. Tutwiler indirectly criticized Mubarak
for his recent meeting with Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader.
   ``Our position on Libya, its support for terrorism and other
regional activities involving destabilization is well known,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``We have made known to Egypt our views and
concerns.''
   President Bush talked to Mubarak about Libya when the Egyptian
President was at the White House last month, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``We are confident that Egypt understands our position on
Libya,'' she said.

<HEAD>Tibetan Spiritual Leader and Nobel Winner Returns to India</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Tibetans threw flowers and
offered silk scarves in a tumultous welcome Tuesday for their
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who returned to his home-in-exile
with the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Dalai Lama arrived at New Delhi's international airport just
past midnight and was greeted by cheering men, women and children
from the 100,000-member Tibetan community exiled in India.
   Inside the airport's arrival lounge, monks in maroon and saffron
robes lined up to welcome the 54-year-old Dalai Lama with low bows
and traditional gifts of white scarves. Outside, thousands of
Tibetans lighted incense sticks and covered the roadway with
marigold and rose petals.
   ``I feel (the award) is recognition of my sincerest motivation
for nonviolent action,'' the leader of Tibet's resistance to
Chinese rule told reporters. ``I feel it may help to create more
awareness for the value of compassion and nonviolence.''
   When he was awarded the prize in Oslo, Norway, on Oct. 5, the
Dalai Lama was in California on one of the U.S. visits he makes at
least twice a year to minister to Buddhist faithful and to heighten
international awareness of the Tibetan struggle. He spent four
weeks in the United States on this trip.
   The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising
against the 1951 Chinese annexation of his remote Himalayan nation.
He has set up a government-in-exile in Dharamsala, an Indian town
300 miles north of New Delhi.
   In recent months, he has dropped demands for complete Tibetan
independence and has proposed that China retain responsibility for
military and foreign policy.
   So far, there has been no concession by China. The Beijing
government has said it is willing to discuss Tibet. However, it
insists Tibet must remain an integral part of China.
   Asked whether his receiving the 1989 Nobel Prize could alter
Beijing's stance, the Dalai Lama said: ``At the moment, I don't
know. But after a few months you may see something.'' He did not
elaborate.
   China has condemned the award as an insult and interference in
its internal affairs.
   The Dalai Lama, dressed in the sleeveless robes of an ordinary
Buddhist monk and wearing a rosary on his left wrist, said he had
still not decided what to do with the award's $469,000 cash prize.
   ``I may contribute something for the starving people in Africa
or create an institution for world peace,'' he said. ``I need some
more ideas. I will speak to my colleagues.''

<HEAD>30 Killed in Guerrilla Ambush in Latest Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas from a group allied with
drug traffickers ambushed two trucks carrying soldiers and
civilians in the northeastern jungle, and 30 people were killed,
police said Monday.
   In other attacks, leftist Shining Path rebels killed three
council members Monday in Munani, a village 615 miles southeast of
Lima, and two peasants in Chongos Bajos, a hamlet 140 miles east of
the capital.
   The attacks Monday and the ambush Sunday, also blamed on Shining
Path fighters, continued a wave of violence that has already killed
215 people this month.
   It is one of the heaviest periods of violence since the
Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980. More
than 15,000 people have been killed in Peru's political violence.
   Police said 17 civilians, including women and children, 10
guerrillas and three soldiers were killed Sunday when the rebels
burst out from the jungle along the road and ambushed the trucks
near Tocache, a town 260 miles northeast of Lima.
   The three dead soldiers included a lieutenant in command of the
military patrol riding in the trucks.
   The police report did not provide details. New reports said most
of the rebels were killed when army troops aboard helicopters came
to help the ambushed patrol.
   Tocache is in the Upper Huallaga Valley in Peru's highland
jungle. More than 60 percent of the world's coca crop, used to make
cocaine, is grown in the region.
   Colombian drug buyers aboard small planes fly into dozens of
illegal airstrips in the area to pick up semi-refined cocaine,
which is later turned into pure cocaine in Colombia and smuggled to
the United States and Europe.
   U.S. narcotics officials and police say the Shining Path rebels
provide protection to coca farmers and drug-trafficking gangs in
return for a share of their profits.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Overnight Placement of Children in State Care</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Children under state care would no
longer be shuffled from place to place at night but would have
permanent places to stay under an agreement presented Monday to a
judge.
   Child Advocate Laureen D'Ambra, who works for the state to
protect children's rights, said Rhode Island's Department For
Children and Their Families promised to add 45 beds in foster homes
and group programs by June 30 and to spend $1 million to add 45
more by Jan. 31, 1991.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine said he would decide
within three days whether to accept the agreement. D'Ambra said the
department acted in good faith and she believed it would try to
adhere to the agreement.
   The agreement would end D'Ambra's quest for a contempt citation
against department Director Joseph J. Picano, who did not meet a
July 15 deadline to end most night-to-night placement to settle the
child advocate's 1986 lawsuit against the department.
   The department now has agreed to shuffle children on a
night-to-night basis for no more than three consecutive nights by
Nov. 30 and eliminate any night-to-night placement by June 30,
except for emergencies.
   The state pays foster homes and other facilities $20 per night
per child beyond the their licensed capacity, D'Ambra said.
   ``It was easy for them,'' she said, but the children had to
leave every morning and fend for themselves at various day programs
before finding out where they would sleep the next night. They do
not go to school, D'Ambra said.
   ``They're carrying their clothes around in trashbags and they
are certainly not in a postion to receive counseling,'' said
D'Ambra. The routine ``wears them down to the point of hopelessness
in many cases.''
   Some children under 13 not allowed in the various day programs
have been forced to stay in the department's offices during the
day, said D'Ambra.
   She estimated an average of five children per night don't know
where they will sleep. Stephan H. Lieberman, the department's
assistant director of community resources, said the caseload of
those up to age 21 who need placement has grown 8 percent to 10
percent yearly, or about 200 children a year, ranging from new
children in the system to those kicked out of other programs.
   There also has been a decrease in the number of foster homes,
D'Ambra said.
   Among the alternatives are more group homes, residential
programs and apartments for older teen-agers, D'Ambra said.
   Lieberman said the state had created 45 beds, exceeding the 40
called for in the original settlement of the 1986 lawsuit, but then
lost 21 through the closing of the overnight section of a group
home.

<HEAD>Israeli-Planted Love Lure Reportedly Prompted Syrian Pilot to Defect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's secret service used a Druse
woman to lure the Syrian air force pilot who defected to Israel
last week with his Soviet-made MiG-23 fighter jet, the newspaper
Ad-Diyar reported Monday.
   The Oct. 11 flight into northern Israel caused a public uproar
in Israel over possible flaws in the air defense system along the
border with Syria.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Monday a military
investigation team concluded a ``faulty report and mistaken
decision-making process'' in Israel's air force led to a failure in
intercepting the flight. It recommended an officer be reprimanded,
and military officials said the air force was expected to update
its standing orders and procedures related to air infiltrations.
   Ad-Diyar, a conservative daily based in Christian east Beirut,
said in an unsourced front-page reportthat a Druse woman, who was
not identified, confessed she had been recruited by Israeli
intelligence following her arrest after her boyfriend defected.
   Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel, 34, was on a training flight over
southern Syria when he flew into Israel and landed at an airstrip
used by crop-dusting planes.
   Ad-Diyar said Israel was interested in gaining direct
information from a Syrian pilot on the MiG-23. Syria is Israel's
archfoe in the Middle East.
   ``After some surveillance, an Israeli secret service officer
found out that a Syrian Druse girl was having an affair with a
Syrian pilot,'' the paper said.
   It said the woman from Soweida, the provincial capital of
southern Syria, frequently visited Druse relatives in Hasbaya, just
outside an Israeli-controlled security zone in south Lebanon.
   The officer approached the woman and recruited her to work for
Mossad, giving her enough money to lure Adel to defect to Israel,
Ad-Diyar said.
   ``The girl told her boyfriend that Israel would provide them
with a house and a large amount of money, estimated at millions of
dollars, or new documents with which the couple could travel to the
United States,'' it added.
   It said Mossad provided Adel with a special radio frequency for
contacting Israeli authorities once in the air so he could be given
a flight plan.
   After the warning Adel would revert to the normal Syrian air
force frequency and continue his routine training flight for about
20 minutes to give Israel time to prepare for his arrival.
   The newspaper said Adel was ordered on a training flight the day
after receiving the Israeli instructions and had no time to warn
his girlfriend.
   Ad-Diyar said the girl was at home unaware of the actual
defection, preparing to leave for Israel two days later via
Hasbaya, to join Adel.
   It said Syrian secret police arrested a number of people
connected to Adel, including his girlfriend, after the defection.
   ``She revealed everything during interrogation,'' Ad-Diyar said.
   Adel asked for political asylum in Israel. He said he defected
in search of freedom and democracy.
   Israeli reports said Adel flew for seven minutes over Israeli
territory before radar detected his plane, leading to an uproar
over what appeared to be an air defense failure.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed for calm and Chief of
Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron ordered an investigation.
   A military command statement said Monday that investigators
recommended the colonel in charge of Israel's air defenses at the
time be reprimanded for his actions following a mistaken decision.
   They recommended that the air traffic controller in charge at
the time, a lieutenant colonel, be ``notified of the faulty report
that contributed to a mistaken decision.''
   ``A number of technical malfunctions have been identified and
will be dealt with by the air force,'' the statement said. Shomron
told Israel TV these were ``secondary malfunctions.''
   The army said Shomron accepted the team's recommendations.
   One question not answered was why Adel spent 20 minutes on the
ground with no security officials around after landing at Megiddo,
a few minutes' flight from Haifa, a port city of 250,000.

   At least 120,000 pro-democracy demonstrators
marched peacefully through downtown Leipzig for three hours Monday
night in the largest protest of communist East Germany's 40-year
history, opposition activists said.
   Official media said, in their first prompt report of such a
protest, that ``tens of thousands of citizens'' participated.
   Security was increased in East Berlin, the nation's capital.
Knots of police and other security forces could be seen on many
streets.
   Activists reported no incidents in Leipzig, where more than
70,000 protesters marched Oct. 9 after a month in which tens of
thousands of East Germans fled to the West.
   Protesters assembled for Monday's march after services in five
churches, said the main evening news program ``Aktuella Kamera.''
It did not show the march.
   ``After peace services ... tens of thousands of citizens took
part in a demonstration,'' the program said. ``Thanks to the
restraint of the police and other security forces, no incidents
occurred.''
   Christoph Wonneberger, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church in
Leipzig, said in a telephone interview with West Germany's ZDF
television that more than 120,000 people marched. Wonneberger often
speaks for pro-reform groups.
   Marchers chanted ``We are the People!'' and ``Democracy Now or
Never!''
   In a foreign policy speech in Washington, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said reunification of their nation was a
``legitimate right'' of Germans.
   The Monday demonstration followed weekend protests in Halle by
20,000 people and in Plauen, near the Czechoslovak border, where
more than 15,000 gathered, opposition sources said.
   They said the Plauen march lasted about two hours Saturday
afternoon and the crowd chanted ``Democracy now!'' Banners bore the
same inscription and placards called for free expression and a free
press.
   An opposition source told The Associated Press no uniformed
police were in the area and there was no interference.
   Late Sunday, 4,000 young East Germans demanding reform jammed
the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in East Berlin for a rock
concert, chanting in English: ``We are here to stay!''
   A West German newspaper said regional Communist Party officials
demanded the dismissal of hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
   Mounting pressure was evident on Honecker, 77, and other members
of the aging, doctrinaire leadership. Unrest spread and the flight
of thousands of East Germans continued.
   Among those leaving were more than 1,300 refugees under the care
of the West German Embassy in Warsaw, who have been promised
special exit permits. West Germany gives automatic citizenship to
East Germans.
   Reports have spread for days that Honecker's 18-year tenure as
head of the Communist Party may be about to end.
   The mass-circulation West German newspaper Bild reported Monday
that dissatisfaction had spread to the regional party leaders.
   It quoted ``well informed'' sources in East Berlin as saying 13
of the 15 regional chiefs were demanding Honecker be ousted and the
21-member Politburo shaken up.
   Bild said the regional leaders ``fear that strikes and unrest
will break out all across the nation.'' It said they want the
government to meet with opposition groups, ease travel restrictions
and hold free elections.
   The newspaper, owned by the conservative Springer publishing
group, said the regional leaders demanded a special meeting of the
party Central Committee to make the changes. Bild sent its report
to other news media Monday, in advance of publication in Tuesday
editions.
   Politburo members hold their regular weekly meeting Tuesday and
there has been speculation this week's session would indicate
Honecker's future.
   Several street protests in East Germany this month were the
largest since Soviet troops crushed a workers' rebellion in 1953.
   Most were broken up by police using clubs, but on Oct. 9, about
70,000 people marched in Leipzig without police interference,
chanting ``Freiheit!'' _ the German word for freedom.
   Most protesters are young East Germans who insist they want to
stay and help reform the country, not flee to the West.
   Harry Tisch, the government's labor chief, has acknowledged
growing unrest among the 8.6 million East German workers.
   ``I can say openly that the climate among the workers is
tense,'' Tisch, a Politburo member, said in an interview with the
official newspaper Junge Welt.
   As head of the state labor federation Freie Deutsche
Gewerkschaftsbund, he oversees the nation's work force.
   More than 52,000 East Germans have fled West since late July,
either across Hungary's open border with Austria or after seeking
refuge at West German embassies in Warsaw or Prague.

   South Korea and North Korea reached
tentative agreement Monday to allow visits between divided families
for only the second time since 1945, but they remained divided on
conditions for the exchanges.
   The two sides meeting at Red Cross talks agreed to allow 300
people from each nation to visit their relatives Dec. 8. They
failed to agree on how long the visits would last or where visitors
would be allowed to go.
   The nations also failed to agree on terms for an exchange of
artists and entertainers as part of the family visits. Both sides
agreed to meet again at Panmunjom Nov. 8 to try to iron out details.
   The tentative breakthrough came after months of stalemate in
various talks on easing tension. The agreement could collapse if
the two sides fail to resolve the differences.
   The nations, divided in 1945, have only once allowed visits by
divided families when 50 people from each side were allowed to
visit relatives for three days before returning home in 1985.
   North Korea and South Korea are bitter rivals that have clashed
frequently over the years. The border is sealed and more than 10
million divided relatives on both sides are unable to have any
contact.
   Both sides said in separate news conferences that they also
tentatively decided to hold a Red Cross conference on the reunion
of separated families in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang on Dec.
15.
   Song Young-dae, chief South Korean delegate, and his North
Korean counterpart, Park Young Soo, acknolwedged the proposed
exchange visits and Red Cross meeting wouldn't take place unless
remaining problems are solved.
   Neverthless, Song said the agreement represented ``some
progress.''
   ``I think a compromise might be possible if both sides negotiate
on the principle of mutual concession,'' Song said.
   When asked about prospects for a final agreement, Park said,
``Let's wait and see until how it comes out at the next session.''
   Song said North Korea insisted on sending 300 relatives and 300
artists and entertainers while South Korea had stuck to its
position of each side sending 300 relatives and 50 entertainers.
The two sides also disagreed on how long the visits would last.
   South Korea proposed relatives be permitted to visit their
hometowns in the North, but North Korean delegates refused, saying
the visits must be confined to Seoul and Pyongyang.
   Park said the South Korean request was unrealistic because there
was no guarantee that visiting South Koreans would still find
relatives in their hometowns.
   Park said North Korea wanted to send more art performers as a
``symbolic'' gesture on the occasion of the second exchange of
relatives. The two sides exchanged 50 artists in the 1985 visit by
relatives.
   South Korea said emphasis should be on the relative exchanges
with the performers remaining a secondary matter. Some South Korean
officials say North Korea wants to send entertainers to perform
communist propaganda.

<HEAD>Britain Mixes Funky Madness With Relaxed, Flowing Styles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associaed Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British designers abandoned power dressing in
their first collections for the 1990s, some returning to the wacky
madness that made London fashions famous and others launching the
decade in a relaxed, flowing style.
   After putting women in status-conscious, super-structured
clothes with big, padded shoulders for several years, British
designers have followed Milan in loosening up their styles for next
summer.
   But there's no uniform look and individuality remains the key
fashion word in the British collections, being shown through
Tuesday.
   ``I would say it's anything flows in the 1990s and
super-structure is out,'' said Bernie Ozer, vice-president of AMC
Corp., the giant New York buying company. ``The structured jacket
is out but jackets in softer varieties and shapes are a must for
the '90s. ... It will also be the decade of the accessory which has
never gotten its proper due.''
   The big names in British fashion _ Rifat Ozbek, Arabella Pollen,
Bruce Oldfield, Edina Ronay and Bellville Sassoon _ turned out some
beautiful clothes. But the big news was in the youth market where
there was a revival of kooky, fun and sometimes off-the-wall
clothes.
   ``The street look here has always been good,'' Ozer said.
``Sometimes it's fashionable to like it. Sometimes it's
unfashionable to like it. It's now in fashion.''
   Bodymap did their first catwalk show in three years on the theme
``Life Is,'' featuring rock stars, drag queens, mini-skirts with
plants and roses, Victorian-style bathing suits and one-shoulder
cycle suits.
   Red or Dead's Space-Baby Collection, which admittedly looks at
the future with ``tongue firmly in cheek,'' was a hit with buyers
including the U.S. chain Nordstrom and New York's Trash and
Vaudeville boutique and Los Angeles' Roppongi boutique.
   It features see-through plastics appliqued with a logo of a
smiling space-baby in a plastic helmet, micro shorts, skirts and
jackets cheekily cut away to reveal flesh _ the skirts with two
waistbands and two transparent space-baby belts.
   ``It's just a fresh approach rather than all the power-dressing
that's been around for years,'' said 28-year-old co-owner Wayne
Hemingway. ``It's bright, cheerful, fun and the reaction has been
brilliant.''
   Vivienne Westwood, the 48-year-old godmother of British fashion
innovation who instituted the punk cult during the 1970s and is a
nominee for Designer of the Year, showed her collection ``Britain
Must Go Pagan'' Monday evening. Though it had its wild moments,
many buyers said it was one of her most commercial ranges.
   It certainly was not for anyone with an extra ounce of fat,
featuring very sexy body-clinging catsuits, one-shoulder
mummy-style knit mini-dresses, and skimpy shorts, one pair with an
outrageous gold phallus. Many designs were decorated with
rhinestone chains, some draped in tiers down to the floor and
others dangling from the calf.
   Pam Hogg, a young Scottish designer who used to show with
Hyper-Hyper, did her first solo collection, another very sexy show
with bras like belts, leggings and skin-tight bustier tops, lace-up
corsets, and clinging trousers with stretch patent leather in back
and a series of straps in front with a bikini peeping through.
   Much of the media and buyer attention focused on the six
contenders for the Designer of the Year that is being presented
Tuesday night by Princess Diana.
   Rifat Ozbek, last year's winner and a hot contender again this
year, abandoned his love of color for a stunning all-white
collection called ``New Age Nirvana,'' which won raves from the
critics.
   His quest for purity features silky knit jogging pants, softly
wrapped skirts topped by loose and layered tunics, shimmering,
sequinned, off-the-shoulder dresses, boleros and hooded bomber
jackets _ one studded with crystal rhinestones, the yin yang symbol
and the appliqued message ``Release It.''
   Workers for Freedom, the design duo of Graham Fraser and Richard
Nott who were also nominated, did linen shirts trimmed in lace,
frilled and fitted waistcoats over soft, cropped silk trousers and
ankle-length chiffon skirts strewn with artificial flowers and worn

<HEAD>Government Begins Dismissing Public Employees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government started cutting the
public payroll with dismissals Monday and Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega rearranged military ranks thinned by disloyalty.
   Noriega, who commands the Panamanian Defense Forces and runs the
country, named close associates to several key posts over the
weekend but many important positions, including the chief of
intelligence, remained open.
   Col. Guillermo Wong, the former intelligence chief, was among
those arrested after an unsuccessful coup Oct. 3. Failure to
replace him suggested Noriega may be having trouble finding enough
trustworthy senior officers.
   Gustavo Gonzalez, the planning and economic policy minister,
told journalists Monday there would be no ``massive firings'' of
public employees but said the public payroll must be reduced.
   ``We do not have a budget,'' he told reporters at a luncheon
with the Bankers Association. ``We are operating on a cash flow
basis and that flow is now about 50 per cent of what it was two
years ago.''
   Panama's economy has been hurt badly by U.S. economic sanctions
imposed after Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking and
money laundering charges in February 1988.
   Noriega claims the charges and the coup attempt are part of a
U.S. plot to remove him and keep the Panama Canal, which by treaty
is to be turned over to Panama at the end of 1999.
   Bankers Association president Edgardo Lasso said lack of
confidence caused by the sanctions and political instability had
caused a serious recession. He denied Panama was a center for
laundering drug money.
   Gonzalez said high public officials had taken salary reductions
ranging from 20 to 30 percent, and ``that includes Gen. Noriega.''
   One public employee told journalists she and four others had
been accused of ``conspiring against the state'' Monday and fired.
   Government officials, including Noriega, urged the dismissal of
public employees who celebrated or showed disloyalty while the
attempted coup was in process.
   ``War laws'' announced by Noriega after the coup include
disloyalty among the reasons for dismissal of public employees.
   The government said an International Monetary Fund mission was
arriving to ``evaluate the country's situation and study measures
the government is considering to improve the economic situation.''
   Panama's foreign debt is $3.8 billion and it is $1.2 billion
behind in payments on interest and principal.
   Capt. Rafael Gaytan, for two years the director of Noriega's
personal security, was named head of the Special Anti-Terrorist
Forces, an elite unit said to have been blocked by U.S. forces from
aiding Noreiga the day of the coup.
   Capt. Rafael Cedeno, another officer close to Noriega, was named
deputy director of intelligence. Cedeno has worked closely with
Noriega since the early '80s.
   Capt. Rafael Jurado became commander of the 2nd Military Zone
near the Costa Rican border and Col. Roberto Armijo was named
director of personnel, replacing Col. Julio Ow Young, arrested in
connection with the coup.

   Crier, who never worked in news until she reported for work two

flubs and wasn't visibily nervous in her debut on camera and on the
one-hour weeknight series.
   Crier was in CNN headquarters in Atlanta, while Shaw, with CNN

   Their newscast, which CNN promotions say ``will change the face
of evening news,'' is CNN's first major push against the ``CBS
Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' and the ``NBC Nightly

   However, only its second half-hour directly competes with those
broadcasts, and only in the Eastern and Central time zones. It
starts each night at 6 p.m. EDT and is nationally broadcast then,
with no taped repeats for the West Coast.
   West Coast affiliates of the major networks tape the networks'
nightly newscasts for broadcast three or 3{ hours after those
programs appear in the East.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court
on Monday to uphold a Missouri decision barring doctors from
shutting off a life-support system for a severely brain-damaged
woman.
   Siding with the state of Missouri in the first ``right-do-die''
case before the high court, the department argued that the parents
of Nancy Cruzan, 31, did not have a right to stop their daughter's
treatment without a court order.
   The Justice Department urged the high court to uphold a 4-3
decision of the Missouri Supreme Court that barred Joe and Joyce
Cruzan from allowing doctors to remove a feeding tube surgically
implanted in their daughter's stomach.
   Ms. Cruzan, who breathes normally and has periods of
wakefulness, is kept alive by feedings through the tube. Doctors
say that Ms. Cruzan is incapable of interacting with her
environment and has no thoughts or emotions.
   A mentally competent adult may have a right to refuse or end
treatment, but the decision to withdraw life-support systems cannot
be left to guardians acting on behalf of a person unable to express
a choice, the Justice Department said.
   ``There is no basis for concluding that petitioner's parents
have a due process right to halt her treatment that is somehow
independent of petitioner's own desires,'' the department said in a
friend-of-the-court brief.
   ``Whatever may be said about the rights of a currently competent
adult, an adult who is now incompetent cannot make an informed
decision to refuse treatment, and thus cannot be said to have a
qualified fundamental right,'' the Justice Department said in its
brief submitted by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr.
   The Justice Department offered an argument that was at odds with
the American Medical Association and other groups, which joined the
Cruzans in urging the high court to allow withdrawal of the tube.
   The department said the federal government has an interest in
the case because it operates 443 hospitals and nursing homes where
``issues about termination of treatment arise ... on a continuing
basis.''
   ``Reasonable minds can differ on whether courts are best suited
to determine an incompetent patient's preferences'' but the
Missouri court ``applied reasonable rules in this case,'' the brief
argued.
   The Missouri court ``reasonably concluded that any error should
be made on the side of life,'' it continued.
   ``In so doing, however, the court did not take an unreasonably
rigid approach to the evidence of petitioner's wishes.''
   The Cruzans testified that at one point their daughter told them
she would not want to be kept alive in a permanent coma. But the
Missouri court did not accept their statement as deciding the issue.
   ``In view of the state's powerful interests in protecting
incompetent persons against abuse an ensuring that any decision
made in the past was well-considered, state rules of evidence and
procedure designed to give effect to previous decisions to refuse
treatment should be upheld as long as they are `reasonably
designed' to serve an important state interest,'' the Justice
Department said.
   The department has argued that this standard should also be
applied to laws that prohibit or restrict abortion. The brief's
discussion of privacy rights mirrored the position the Justice
Department has taken on the abortion issue.
   The department said the ``court should decline petitioner's
invitation to extend the `right of privacy' to cover all types of
decisions about medical treatment and procedures.''

<HEAD>Yusupov and Karpov Draw Seventh Game; Match Tied</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Grandmasters Artur Yusupov and Anatoly
Karpov agreed to a 61-move draw Monday in the seventh game in their
World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal to leave the match
tied 3.5-3.5 with one round remaining.
   In the other semifinal, Jan Timman of the Netherlands took a
timeout, postponing the eighth game of his tied semifinal with Jon
Speelman of England. After seven games, each player has scored 3.5
points.
   Final round faceoffs in both contests are set for Tuesday.
   After a zig-zag battle, Karpov emerged from a nerve-wracking
time scramble, a pawn behind in an endgame but in a position where
Yusupov had very few chances to win.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game contest starting
October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off in the
Candidates' final next March.
   If either of the eight-game contests ends in a 4-4 tie, a
two-game minimatch will be played, followed if necessary by sudden
death tiebreakers.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   Karpov held the world title for 10 years until 1985 and had been
widely expected to crush his opponent.
   His poor performance led Spanish chess commentator Leontxo
Garcia to remark, ``Karpov is very close to the abyss and only the
advantage of the white pieces can save him.''
   Karpov and Speelman will play white on Tuesday.
   A decisive victory in the sixth game on Saturday left Speelman
with the psychological initiative.
   Playing white on Monday, Yusupov failed to gain any advantage
from the opening and began to fall dangerously short of time.
   But a faulty plan from Karpov starting on the 24th move let
Yusupov escape the pressure, and white suddenly gained the
initiative in the center by combining a battery of two rooks and a
queen.
   Karpov sank deep into thought, leaving himself three minutes to
make 10 moves.
   As Yusopov exchanged down to reach an ending with an extra pawn,
Karpov's nerves began to show.
   But after reaching the time control, Karpov had few problems in
achieving a draw.
   Yusupov played on for a further 20 moves, but finally gave up
and offered a draw after playing his 61st move.

<HEAD>Commitment To Harsh Economic Reform Tested In Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland on Monday weathered a test of its
resolve to endure painful economic reform as Parliament approved
curbs on automatic wage increases without special provisions for
food price rises.
   It was the second day of parliamentary debate on a plan to
modify the system of pegging wage raises to price increases. The
system was devised during round-table talks last spring between
communist authorities and the then-opposition to offset the worst
effects of the shift to a market economy.
   The Solidarity-led government said some limit was needed to
reign in rocketing inflation. It estimated that the special
provision for covering food prices would cost more than $833
million.
   The National Bank meanwhile devalued the zloty Monday for the
12th time this year from the previous rate of 1,791 zlotys to the
dollar to 2,100 zlotys to the dollar _ or 17.2 percent _ as efforts
to align the official rate and a higher commercial rate continued.
   Parliament endorsed the limited indexation plan by a lukewarm
vote of 188 in favor, 27 against and 133 abstaining.
   Members of the Democratic Party, one of the two minor parties
that shifted from the communist bloc to form a majority coalition
with Solidarity, abstained.
   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz told state TV he was
satisfied.
   ``However, incomes will still grow at a high rate,'' he said.
``Next year we will have to take more decisive steps to slow the
inflationary growth of incomes.''
   Since food price controls were lifted on Aug. 1, the last act of
the communist-led government, prices of items such as butter have
increased 1,000 percent and meat prices have gone up sevenfold.
   But the East bloc's first non-communist government is faced with
reducing a huge budget defict and curbing raging inflation that
accelerated in August to a 600 percent annual rate.
   ``Full compensation of food price increases until the end of the
year would surely make society's situation easier ... From the
point of view of the budget, however, the situation is serious,''
said Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, the veteran Solidarity activist in
charge of indexation.
   Experts say the 1989 budget deficit could could total $5.3
billion without radical controls.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's cabinet studied such
measures during weekend meetings _ a 15-month moratorium on
starting major new government-funded projects; a massive shift of
military food, medicine and industrial capacity to the civilian
side, and ending subsidies to some mines and food enterprises.
   But the government said the most important step was revising
indexation rules.
   The initial plan raised all wages by 80 percent of the increase
of the cost of living from July to December, regardless of raises
already received.
   The government revision provides for raises covering 100 percent
of the price increases, less raises already awarded, retroactively
for the third quarter of the year, and covering 80 percent of the
increase for the last three months.
   Because most workers have received substantial raises as
managers struggled to keep up with inflation, the revised proposal
means a much more modest indexation program overall.
   The higher cost alternative, proposed by some Solidarity union
representatives, would have compensated 100 percent of the increase
in food prices, a popular idea among price-shocked Poles.
   Sejm Deputy Jan Krol of the Solidarity delegation told
Parliament it must be understood that the transition to a market
economy will result in some people having higher incomes than
others, and that the costs of reform cannot be spread evenly.
   ``The safeguarding of minimal living standards means that nobody
in Poland, as a result of reforms ... should suffer hunger,'' he
said.
   ``However, a reimbursement of the cost of living, as a result of
indexation ... at 100 percent, is out of the question, and the
society should not be presented with such illusions,'' he said.

   President Bush signed an order Monday night
cutting federal programs by $16.1 billion after giving up hopes for
a last-minute compromise with Congress.
   ``It's the law. We're ready to implement it,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. He said that, while the
administration had sought to avoid the almost across-the-board cuts
triggered by the nation's Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting law, ``it
might even be good'' if the budget ax does fall.
   The order Bush signed shortly before 7 p.m., to take effect at
midnight, was largely procedural as the spending cuts were
automatic under the law.
   ``We'll continue to work with the Congress'' in seeking to
develop a compromise to reduce the deficit to roll back the
spending cuts, Fitzwater said. ``But there is some feeling here
that (the automatic cuts) are the way to go. It will reduce
spending in a very effective fashion.''
   ``Everyone's going to have to take in their belts,'' he
added.``It will have a hit, there's no doubt about it.''
   Earlier, budget director Richard Darman said ``we are doing what
the law requires.''
   The cutbacks are required under the Gramm-Rudman law because of
the failure of Congress and the White House to agree on a
deficit-reduction package.
   The only hope for averting the cuts had been for the House and
Senate to agree to a compromise budget-cutting bill and send it to
Bush for his signature by midnight.
   Such quick work was made virtually impossible by the situation
on Capitol Hill. The House version of the measure was studded with
dozens of controversial provisions _ ranging from Bush's cherished
capital gains tax cut to an expansion of child care services _ and
many lawmakers were out of town.
   Fitzwater said Bush's order would appear in Tuesday's Federal
Register specifying the across-the-board cuts in most federal
programs, outside of Social Security and other entitlements.
   House leaders met during the day to see if there was any way to
accomplish a lightning-fast completion of a budget-cutting bill,
acceptable to the White House, by midnight. But this came to nought
and the House recessed for the evening.
   They said a more attainable goal was for House and Senate
leaders to complete a deficit-reduction measure in days or weeks.
   ``We're going to try to reach agreement with the Senate and
avoid sequester as a permanent matter,'' said House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., using the formal name for the Gramm-Rudman cuts.
   Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back
the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting
bill.
   Imposition of the cuts _ as occurred in 1986 and 1987, remaining
in place the first year, being rolled back the second _ is
nonetheless a political embarrassment to members of both political
parties, adding to a public perception of a Congress congenitally
unable to do its budget work properly.
   The practical effects for the first several weeks are expected
to be nil, however, because agencies can juggle their funds to make
up for spot shortfalls.
   Darman, in a move apparently aimed at increasing pressure on
Congress to finish the deficit-reduction bill quickly, said Monday
that the cuts would be imposed at a more detailed level than in
1987. He said the effect would be to give bureaucrats less
flexibility and accelerate the time in which the cutbacks would be
felt.
   ``It has a little more discipline to it,'' Darman said of the
new method of applying the cuts.
   Darman said administration officials want Congress to send Bush
the streamlined $14 billion deficit-cutting measure the Senate
approved late Friday. Then, he said, the administration and GOP
lawmakers would work for congressional approval of a capital gains
tax cut on a separate bill.
   If the House and Senate try instead to reach middle ground on
their deficit-reduction bills, he said, ``we're going to insist on
preserving capital gains'' in the final measure.
   Darman reiterated his preference for keeping the Gramm-Rudman
cuts permanent.
   House leaders said their bill would reduce the deficit by $11
billion, but Darman said it contains just $2.8 billion in true
savings. It also includes a broadening of child care programs and
other provisions the administration opposes.
   ``It's not necessarily all that bad to go with'' the real,
automatic cuts, he said.
   The cuts are triggered because the projected budget deficit for
fiscal 1990 _ which began Oct. 1 _ is $116.1 billion. The
Gramm-Rudman law requires the reductions if the projected deficit
exceeds the $100 billion target by more than $10 billion.
   The cuts are applied evenly between defense and non-defense
programs _ $8.05 billion to each.
   That translates to a 4.3 percent cut in defense programs and 5.3
percent in domestic spending. Large amounts of spending are exempt
from the reductions, including Social Security, many benefit
programs for the poor and payments on the national debt. Several
other programs _ such as Medicare _ are limited to 2 percent
reductions.

<HEAD>U.S. Repeats Acceptance Of Minimal Role For Khmer Rouge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Monday repeated
that it would not oppose including the Khmer Rouge in a Cambodian
coalition government as a means of ending the civil war in that
country.
   The U.S. position remained that the Khmer Rouge, the communist
force that slaughtered thousands of their compatriots while in
power in the 1970's, should have no more than a minimal role in any
new government in Cambodia.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the U.S. position had changed little since a multilateral
conference in July failed to find a solution to the Cambodian civil
war.
   Administration officials have met representatives of China and
the Soviet Union to discuss the formation of a coalition Cambodian
government to replace the Hun Sen regime currently in power, State
Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler told a briefing.
   Hun Sen, installed after the Vietnamese invasion that drove the
Khmer Rouge from power in 1978, remains in charge despite the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, and he has refused proposals for a
coalition government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed the issue with
his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, at their meeting in
Wyoming last month, but neither Tutwiler nor other State Department
officials would discuss the behind-the-scenes negotiations.
   Tutwiler told reporters that ``we have made clear that our
ability to support any Cambodian government is directly and
inversely related to the degree of Khmer Rouge participation, if
any, in it.''
   Tutwiler's statement differed only slightly from the position
enunciated before Congress earlier this month by David F.
Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs.
   ``Unfortunately, absent a viable political process, the
Cambodian factions are likely to turn increasingly to military
means to resolve their conflict, a result most likely to benefit
the Khmer Rouge,'' Lambertson told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Oct. 2.
   ``The United States remains unalterably opposed to a return to
dominance of this abhorrent group, which left a legacy of brutality
and depravity from its reign of terror in the 1970's,'' he said.
   ``A durable settlement in this conflict must be constructed to
ensure that the Khmer Rouge can never regain control and subject
the Cambodian people once again to the horrors of the past,'' he
said.

   House and Senate negotiators agreed Monday
night to provide $40 million this year in federal aid for a major
new airport near Denver.
   The agreement in the conference committee on the appropriations
bill for the Transportation Department came on a voice vote without
dissent.
   It would be the first major airport built in the United States
since the Dallas-Fort Worth airport opened in 1974.
   The House version of the bill provided no money for the Denver
airport, while the Senate had provided $50 million.
   The bill provides $11.9 billion for transportation programs
during the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The committee still has to resolve several other disagreements
and it will be several days before the bill is returned to the
House and Senate for final passage and transmittal to President
Bush for his siganture.

   Four Palestinians accused of terrorist
attacks on U.S. and Jewish targets pleaded innocent Monday at the
first day of their trial amid heavy security rarely encountered in
this country.
   The trial marked Sweden's first court case involving Middle East
terrorism, although police suspect the country has been used as a
hideout for underground Palestinians.
   Police took the security measures apparently fearing reprisals
for the Palestinians' arrests.
   The front of the District courthouse was sealed off, nearby
parking spaces were cleared and surrounding buildings were
searched. Plainclothes policemen occupied the first row of seats in
the courtroom gallery.
   Three of the Palestinians were charged with murder and attempted
murder for planting bombs in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Amsterdam,
the Netherlands, in 1985, and in Stockholm in 1986. All denied any
connection to the attacks.
   One bomb placed outside Copenhagen's Northwest Orient Airline
office killed a Danish bystander and wounded more than 20 people.
Northwest is based in Eagen, a Minneapolis suburb.
   Other targets were a synagogue and an office of El Al Israel
Airlines.
   The fourth defendant admitted he helped assemble explosives but
said he refused to carry out his assignment and threw his bomb into
a Copenhagen canal.
   He pleaded innocent to charges of being an accomplice but
implicated the others during the police investigation.
   The three defendants accused of murder could face a maximum of
20 years in prison in convicted.
   Mohammed Abo Talb, a 35-year-old defendant facing murder
charges, has been called the group leader. He has been described as
senior officer of the Syrian-based Popular Struggle Front, a
hard-line faction that opposes peace overtures of Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The trial was scheduled to last until mid-November.

   U.S.-backed rebels attacked a voter
registration station and several military targets in an attempt to
intimidate the citizenry, a Sandinista military spokesman said
Monday.
   One officer and one civilian died in the attacks Sunday and
early Monday, the spokesman said.
   The rebels, known as Contras, rejected the charges and accused
government troops of attacking them.
   Contras attacked a registration station in El Naranjo, 93 miles
north of Managua, said the spokesman, who refused to be identified,
saying the Defense Ministry was preparing a formal communique.
   Electoral officials and peasants lining up to register at the El
Naranjo station threw themselves to the ground when the Contras
began firing, the spokesman said. Soldiers returned fire, but no
casualties were reported.
   Sunday was the third of four Sundays on which Nicaragua's
estimated 1.9 million eligible voters could register for Feb. 25
general elections. The last registration day is Sunday.
   Early Monday the Contras ambushed an army jeep and killed a
lieutenant and a civilian woman as they traveled near Lovago, 89
miles east of Managua, the spokesman said. Another officer and
civilian were wounded in the attack.
   In a Sunday night attack, the spokesman said, Contras attacked
two army trucks transporting soldiers near San Pedro Lovago, 120
miles east of Managua. One government soldier was wounded, he said.
   The spokesman said the Contras on Sunday also attacked an army
post near Yolaina, 200 miles southeast of Managua, but no
casualties were reported.
   Enrique Bermudez, top military leader of the rebel Nicaraguan
Resistance, on Monday denied ``any offensive action by our troops.''
   ``What is happening is that the Sandinista army is conducting a
cleanup and persecution operation against out forces, who must
defend themselves,'' Bermudez told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from Tegucigalpa, capital of neighboring
Honduras.
   Congress last April approved $49 million in non-lethal aid to
the Contras, most of whom are now camped in Honduran jungle camps
near the Nicaraguan border. Lethal aid was halted in 1988 and the
non-lethal aid bill includes a clause calling for an end to aid if
the Contras stage attacks.
   ``They attack and persecute us while accusing us of attacking
them,'' Bermudez told the AP. ``This is just to fatten up a file
against us, which U.S. congressmen will present during the
discussion next November'' on whether to maintain non-lethal aid.
   Sandinista and Contra leaders agreed to a truce in March 1988, a
month after Congress refused to continue military aid to the rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega, who is seeking re-election, called
early elections as part of regional peace accords that call for
demobilizing the Contras.

<HEAD>Governor Says City Must be Assured Political Freedom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hong Kong's British governor said Monday that
China must assure the city that both political liberty and economic
freedom will continue after the 1997 Chinese takeover if it wants
to reap the financial rewards.
   A crucial time in the transition is next spring when the Beijing
government will publish the basic law, or constitution, for Hong
Kong, said Sir David Wilson.
   The 1984 British-Chinese agreement provides ``one country, two
systems'' for at least 50 years after 1997, and this ``must include
a different political system as well as economic system,'' he said.
   ``I hope the Chinese draftees of the basic law will pay full
attention'' to this, he added, because ``it is tremendously
important not only for post-1997, but for the (pre-1997) vision
people will have'' of their future in Hong Kong, he added.
   ``I believe it enormously important that'' China not dampen Hong
Kongers' confidence in the future, Wilson said at a luncheon at the
National Press Club.
   The basic law is a Chinese document, ``and what the draftees
will finally put into it, I don't know,'' he said.
   But Hong Kong can continue benefitting China ``only if the full
play of capitalism and all the political freedoms that go with it
continue after 1997,'' he said. The benefits flow from the fact
that ``China is quintessentially a capitalist society,'' he said,
providing China a source of foreign exchange, a bridge to Western
technology and a window on the West.
   ``There is no use pretending,'' Wilson said, the crackdown last
June on democracy in China ``shook confidence'' in the future for
Hong Kong. Hong Kongers now require assurances about the future to
encourage them to stay there.
   The British government has declared it will not allow unlimited
migration to Britain of its millions of Hong Kong subjects.
   Emigration from Hong Kong to all countries was running at 20,000
a year from 1981-86, and this year 42,000 departures are expected,
Wilson said.
   Wilson is on a quick visit to Washington, Los Angeles and San
Francisco to generate continued confidence in Hong Kong and its
economy on the part of officials and business people in the United
States, Hong Kong's major export market and investment source.

   Top state officials and the American Civil
Liberties Union said they made headway Monday toward settling a
lawsuit the state attorney general fears will be used by the U.S.
Supreme Court to restrict abortions.
   It was the first face-to-face meeting of the major figures in a
physician's lawsuit challenging state regulations for abortion
clinics since the Supreme Court agreed in July to consider Dr.
Richard Ragsdale's lawsuit.
   Attorney General Neil Hartigan, state public health chief Dr.
Bernard Turnock and ACLU attorney Colleen Connell agreed to meet
again next week to discuss the case.
   Neither Hartigan and Turnock, who are named as defendants in the
lawsuit by Dr. Richard Ragsdale of Rockford, nor Connell, who
represents the physician, would elaborate on Monday's meeting or
identify any obstacles to a settlement.
   Clinics that perform abortions contend the regulations are
unncecessary for patient safety. Ragsdale, of Rockford, operates an
abortion clinic.
   In March 1988, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down
the regulations, agreeing with a trial judge who said they would
force abortion clinics to become ``the functional equivalent of
small hospitals.''
   The state's appeal is one of three cases abortion-rights
activists fear the Supreme Court will use to severely limit
abortions. Anti-abortion activists fighting to overturn Roe vs.
Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion, wanted the high court
to consider the Illinois case.
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the case in December.
   Hartigan, who is pro-choice, said Monday that he opposes ``the
idea of Illinois being used as a football for ... a much broader
decision.'' Hartigan, a Democrat who has announced he will run for
governor next year, said his defense of the abortion clinic rules
should not be viewed as an attempt to overturn Roe vs. Wade
``because that is not our intent.''
   Hartigan indicated the settlement talks are aimed at preventing
the Supreme Court from using the Ragsdale case to overturn Roe vs.
Wade.
   ``I don't think there's any question ... that in fact this case
... might be used for something else,'' he told reporters.
   At issue are state requirements for non-hospital surgical
centers. Ragsdale contends the requirements are medically
unnecessary and designed to discourage abortion providers by
forcing them to build ``the equivalent of a small hospital,'' an
expensive proposition.
   Requirements include 80-square-foot examining rooms,
250-square-foot surgical rooms, some corridor widths of 8 feet,
lounges, lockers and separate toilets for male and female
employees, and a janitor's closet adjoining surgical suites.
   In 1985, U.S. District Judge A. Nordberg certified the lawsuit
as a class action, thus suspending enforcement of the challenged
provisions for all Illinois doctors.

   The space shuttle Atlantis, freed
from technical and legal barriers, was declared ready for a Tuesday
launch with its nuclear-powered cargo. NASA said it expected
neither weather nor demonstrators to interfere.
   ``The vehicle is in good shape, the crew is ready to go fly and
the weather looks like we'll have a good chance to get airborne,''
NASA administrator Richard H. Truly said Monday. ``It's been a long
haul for this mission.''
   The launch from the seaside pad at the Kennedy Space Center is
scheduled for 12:57 p.m. EDT.
   Environmental activists, concerned that an accident could spread
nuclear poison into the atmosphere, demonstrated at a gate leading
to the Kennedy Space Center headquarters, and eight were arrested.
   ``This is just only the beginning of the government's plan to
use nuclear power and weapons in space, including in the Star Wars
program,'' said Jane Brown of the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice.
   The coalition is one of three groups that lost a suit to stop
the launch in U.S. District Court last week. A three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington upheld the judge Monday,
saying his ruling was not appealable.
   The protesters vowed to infiltrate a 30-by-10-mile security zone
and stop the launch. NASA had 200 armed security guards in the area
and there were sea and airborne patrols.
   The space center security chief said perhaps the best protection
is the natural barrier surrounding the launch pad.
   ``We have about 7,000 alligators there, I don't know how many
rattlesnakes, a lot of wild hogs, and probably millions of
mosquitoes,'' Gary Wistrand said.
   Galileo, weighing 6,700 pounds, will be released from Atlantis's
cargo bay 6{ hours after the ship is in orbit, the start of a
six-year, 2.4 billion-mile journey to Jupiter, the largest planet
in the solar system.
   Electricity to run the space probe will come from two nuclear
power packs, each loaded with 24.7 pounds of plutonium-238. NASA
has used such radioactive fuel on 22 previous flights. Three have
been involved in accidents, but no plutonium was released.
   The space agency said in court last week that detailed studies
show the chances of release of radioactive material are
statistically low and that the environmentalists' fears are
unwarranted.
   A large team of experts will be scattered around the center with
detection devices to sample the air in case there is an accident as
the shuttle lifts off. The Department of Energy will have an
airplane aloft and another 150 people standing by, said agency
spokesman Chris West.
   The mission was originally planned to begin in 1982, but was
delayed, first by money troubles and then by the explosion of the
space shuttle Challenger. The cost of the project to date is $1.5
billion, NASA said.
   ``Galileo's been a long time in coming and it's delightful to
sit here and be ready to fly,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``These are very exciting times for space science in
general. Magellan is on its way to Venus, Voyager is on its way to
interstellar space having gone by Neptune, Galileo is sitting on
the pad and there is even more to come.''
   Astronaut Donald Williams is the commander of the crew of five.
The others are Mike McCulley, the pilot, and mission specialists
Shannon Lucid, Ellen Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz.
   Their liftoff was scheduled for last Thursday, but one of the
shuttle's engine computers malfunctioned and had to be replaced.
The countdown for Tuesday's launch began at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   In December 1995, a 737-pound probe is to be released from
Galileo and plunge into Jupiter's cloud layers to take the first
samples of the Jovian atmosphere.
   The main Galileo craft will enter an orbit around the planet,
and its cameras and 10 scientific instruments will gather
information on temperatures, magnetic fields, radiation, cloud
characteristics and gravity.
   Galileo also will study Jupiter for clues to the formation of
the solar system. Many scientists believe the planet still holds
much of the material, in its original state, from which the sun and
planets formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   Planners say the craft's examination of Jupiter will be the most
scientifically rich interplanetary mission yet. The pictures it
relays will be up to 1,000 times sharper than those obtained by the
Voyager spacecrafts.
   ``It is indeed a correct statement to make,'' said Fisk, ``that
this is the second golden age of space science for the United
States.''

   Militant Israelis tried to lay a cornerstone
for a new Jewish temple in Jerusalem's Old City on Monday, sparking
a riot by Palestinians that injured at least 20 people.
   Police barred the Jewish group from bringing the three-ton
cornerstone within the ancient city's walls, foiling an effort by
the Temple Mount Faithful movement to take a first step toward
rebuilding the temple destroyed in 70 A.D. by the Romans.
   High school students in Arab east Jerusalem, apparently enraged
at reports of the planned ceremony, threw rocks at police and
paramilitary border police.
   Fifteen Palestinian students and five policemen were reported
hurt in the melee, one of the most violent incidents in Jerusalem
during the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   At least 40 students were arrested, police said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers dedicated a new
settlement on the ruins of Kefar Darom, a kibbutz overrun by the
Egyptian army in 1948.
   The new Kefar Darom is one of the eight new settlements approved
for construction this year. It joins 132 others already set up in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Near Jericho, Israeli soldiers prevented another group of
settlers from establishing still another settlement because they
failed to get permission, Israel radio said.
   Meanwhile, an 8-year-old Palestinian boy died Monday, three days
after he was shot by Israeli troops during a demonstration in the
occupied Gaza Strip. He was identified by the army as Qassem
Abdallah Abu Lubda of the Khan Yunis refugee camp.
   Abu Lubda's death raised to 596 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising began in
December 1987. At least 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty
Israelis have died in the violence.
   Also Monday, the national news agency Itim said the attorney
general ruled that an Israeli colonel reprimanded for ordering his
troops to break the limbs of Palestinian rioters will not be tried
in a civilian court.
   The official made the decision following an appeal by human
rights groups to try the officer. The attorney general said the
reprimand was sufficient and that the officer would be allowed to
remain in the army until he retires in three years, Itim reported.
   About 100 followers of the Temple Mount Faithful group had
planned to place the three-ton stone at the foot of a ramp leading
to the Temple Mount. Two of Islam's holiest shrines, the Al Aqsa
and Dome of the Rock mosques, sit atop the 35-acre mount.
   But police blocked the metallic gray truck carrying the
cornerstone from entering the Old City. They also prevented the
group from going up to the Temple Mount area.
   Gershon Salomon, the 53-year-old leader of the group, sat
cross-legged at the foot of the ramp. He sang Israeli folk songs
and promised to return daily until the cornerstone was allowed
inside the Old City.
   ``They will throw stones, and we will put up cornerstones here
on the Temple Mount,'' Salomon said. He vowed to place a second
stone for the new temple during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah in
December.
   The demonstrators were largely ignored by thousands of Israelis
and tourists making the traditional pilgrimage to the Western Wall,
the sole remnant of the Second Temple, during the eight-day Jewish
Sukkot holiday.

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian legislators from Lebanon
pushed Monday for a quicker withdrawal of Syrian troops than Arab
mediators have proposed, sources said at a peace conference in this
city.
   They demanded written guarantees that Syria withdraw its 40,000
troops from Lebanon altogether after an initial pullback from the
capital to the eastern Bekaa Valley, the sources said on condition
of anonymity.
   The lawmakers also said the first withdrawal should be made
faster than the two years proposed by Arab mediators, the sources
reported.
   In Beirut, Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun said the 63 members
of Lebanon's parliament gathered in Taif, a Saudi resort, must not
``weaken their demand for the withdrawal of the occupation army.''
   The Christian deputies' position was contained in a memorandum
handed to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. He relayed
its contents to King Fahd.
   The Saudi monarch late Monday chaired a Cabinet meeting to
discuss the document, but few details were released afterwards.
   Saudi Arabia is hosting the conference that began Sept. 30 in an
effort to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war and the latest round
of violence between Syrian and allied Moslem fighters and Christian
forces.
   Syria sent troops to Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. However, Aoun says the Syrians have violated
that mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   The Syrian pullout is being debated as part of a peace plan that
would give more power to Lebanon's Moslems.

<TEXT>
   The lower house unanimously approved
a bill late Monday allowing Filipinos to vote whether to allow the
United States to keep its military bases in this country.
   The move was seen as an effort to counter opposition to the
bases in the Philippines Senate. However, the upper chamber of
Congress must now vote on the referendum bill, which a majority of
senators opposes.
   U.S. and Filipino negotiators began talks in Manila in December
on extending the lease on Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base
and four smaller installations after the current agreement expires
in September 1991.
   Any agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate. Twelve senators say they oppose any extension. Most
surveys, however, show a majority of Filipinos support the bases.
   In its unanimous decision Monday, the 199-member House of
Representatives approved a proposal by Deputy Speaker Antonio
Cuenco for a national referendum within 60 days of completion of
talks on a new bases agreement.
   Under the House bill, results of the referendum would be
non-binding. But political analysts say a strong vote in favor of
the bases would put political pressure on the Senate to approve an
extension.
   ``The best way to give the people the opportunity to participate
in the resolution of the issue is to submit the same in a
referendum to clearly reflect the choice and thus guide the
government in its decision on the matter,'' Cuenco said in his
proposal.
   On Friday, President Corazon Aquino told ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning, America'' that the public should be consulted before the
Senate decides the issue.
   U.S. officials say the bases contribute about $1 billion a year
to the Philippine economy through salaries to local workers,
purchases from local suppliers and spending by 40,000 troops,
military dependents and civilian employees.
   However, opponents of the bases have been riding a wave of
anti-Americanism.

   The armed forces chief Monday
denied a published report that he sold military equipment donated
by the United States and deposited the income in an account he
controlled.
   ``Those press reports are totally false,'' Gen. Humberto
Regalado Hernandez told The Associated Press by telephone.
``Apparently it is a crude and vulgar press campaign against the
armed forces.''
   He called a meeting of the armed forces general staff ``to
analyze the serious accusations presented by The New York Times,
which damage me personally and also all our armed institution.''
   The Times, citing high-ranking Honduran officers who want to see
the general replaced, reported Sunday that Regalado had sold
donated U.S. military equipment to the Honduran military and
deposited the proceeds in a special account he controlled.
   The newspaper said many of the officers, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, were among Regalado's most loyal supporters until
they discovered the arms deals.
   The Times said Honduras has asked the U.S. Defense Department to
investigate corruption complaints against Regalado because of a
possible congressional cutoff of military aid to the country.
   ``It's a wild tale against me,'' Regalado said. ``I don't
control one cent of those funds. I live from my salary, and I am
not rich.''
   His official salary is believed to be about $5,000 a month.
   Regalado, 50, has been chief of the armed forces since January
1987.
   The United States began increasing military aid to Honduras
after the leftist Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua. Military
aid for 1989 was $41.1 million, and $61.3 million is planned for
1990.

   PLO officials rejected the Middle East
peace plan of Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Monday
because it excludes their organization.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said the Palestine Liberation Organization
position also represented a rejection of a peace plan put forth by
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   In a final declaration after two days of meetings, the PLO
Central Council said only the PLO had the right to decide what
Palestinians should talk to Israel.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
urged the PLO to authorize talks with Israel ``if we are ever to
get the (negotiating) process off the ground.''
   Baker's plan does not mention the PLO and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Israel has rejected PLO participation in talks about
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories. Israel views the PLO
as a terrorist group.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Bush administration was not fazed by
Shamir's criticism of its strategy. She said Baker would keep
working with foreign ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmet
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt to get negotiations started.
   ``The PLO and the PLO alone has the right to name the
Palestinian side to any talks with Israel, whether they be
Palestinians inside the occupied territories or outside,'' the PLO
Central Council declaration said Monday.
   The council acts as an intermediary between the policy-making
Palestine National Council and the PLO Executive Committee.
   Its declaration accused Washington of ignoring the PLO as the
``sole legitimate representative'' of the Palestinians and said the
American proposals were only a version of the Israeli plan.
   It said Palestinian-Israeli peace talks proposed recently by the
United States and Egypt could only be preliminary, leading to an
international peace conference under U.N. auspices.
   Sheik Abdel-Hamid Sayeh, chairman of the Palestine National
Council, said: ``There has been a clearcut and overwhelming
opposition to the new American move by all participants'' in the
meetings.
   The 80-seat Central Council convened to unify positions on U.S.,
Israeli and Egyptian peace proposals.
   Sayeh stopped short of specifically criticizing Mubarak's plan,
which also did not mention the PLO.
   ``The general consensus is that the Baker proposals are a new
formula to sell the Shamir plan,'' he said.
   Shamir proposed in May that elections be held in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip to allow Palestinians to choose their own
representatives under a plan for limited self-rule. He ruled out an
Israeli withdrawal and recognition of a Palestinian state.
   Mubarak proposed a modified 10-point election plan under which
Israel would accept the idea of trading land for peace and hold
direct talks with the Palestinians, which he proposed be held in
Cairo.
   Baker later invited the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel to
preliminary talks in Washington.
   On Monday, the Central Council said the PLO would reject all
plans other than its own, which it urged Arabs to accept.
   Arab diplomatic sources said the reference to Arab countries was
meant as a rejection of the Mubarak plan, although the declaration
did not mention it.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo of the PLO Executive Committee, the main
negotiator in a PLO-U.S. dialogue initiated in December, has said
the PLO accepts the concept of face-to-face negotiations with
Israel provided it is allowed to choose the delegates.
   Radical Palestinian leaders George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh had
pushed for outright condemnation of the Egyptian and U.S. plans.

   The White House late Monday abandoned a
last-ditch effort to reach a compromise with Congress on expanding
federally financed abortions to cover cases of rape and incest.
   A veto of the provision, which has already passed the House,
appeared inevitable.
   ``It's our judgement at this time that no one has been able to
provide a convincing reason for the president to change his
position'' opposing such funds, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said. ``So the president will not change his position.''
   The White House and congressional conservatives had searched for
a formula for compromise Monday in hopes of defusing the
politically charged debate.
   On Friday, President Bush said he was seeking ``room for
flexibility.''
   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' Bush said last
week. ``I'm not going to change my position any. but let's see how
those negotiations come out.''
   The administration was looking for what one White House
official, insisting on anonymity, called ``legislative wizardry or
gimmickery'' that would have allowed Bush to avoid a veto of the
provision.
   But abortion-rights leaders stood firm in their unwillingness to
yield, and congressional Democratic leaders held out little hope
for a compromise that would ease the pressure building on Bush.
   ``I would think it is difficult to find a path to compromise on
this,'' House Speaker Tom Foley said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, asked if there
was a compromise brewing, said, ``I know of none.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu met Monday with
Republican anti-aborton leaders in Congress _ Reps. Vin Weber,
R-Minn., Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill. _ just
as he did on Friday.
   ``We have made every effort ... and have decided basically there
is not'' any possibility to find common ground, Fitzwater said.
   ``I don't think really there was ever much opportunity to get
close,'' he added.
   Fitzwater said ``senior advisers'' to the president ``have
recommended a veto.''
   Although the Sununu talks were private, congressional sources
said they were aimed at finding a way for Bush to avoid vetoing the
new abortion provisions, or failing that, to provide compromise
language that Bush could propose after using his veto that would
soften its political impact.
   Fitzwater said talks included a proposal that Bush sign the
legislation while announcing government regulations requiring
stricter reporting requirements. Those requirements would be aimed
at preventing women from later claiming they had been victims of
rape or incest merely as a way of obtaining a federally paid
abortion.
   The debate concerned the appropriations bill for the Labor and
Health and Human Services departments that includes provisions
dropping a decade-long ban on abortions for poor women in cases of
rape or incest. Currently, Medicaid abortions are permitted only in
cases where the mother's life is endangered by her pregnancy.
   The House surprised anti-abortion leaders last week by approving
the provision, which had been passed by the Senate earlier.
   Some attempts at compromise centered on defining the time limit
required for reporting rape or incest by the victims seeking an
abortion. The bill only says the victim must ``promptly'' report
the rape or incest to authorities.
   Abortion rights leaders flatly rejected a GOP proposal to set a
48-hour time limit. Congressional sources said other proposals were
being circulated setting a time limit of 60 days on reporting
incest and 72 hours on reporting rape.
   Bush had threatened to veto the proposal before the House vote.
But the House's vote is being viewed as part of a changing
political climate in favor of abortion rights, and pro-choice
leaders said a veto by Bush would produce a political backlash
against himself and congressional Republicans.
   ``If he vetos it, it hurts him,'' said Sen. Robert Packwood,
R-Ore., a supporter of abortion rights. ``It hurts our party. It
hurts our candidates.''
   Packwood said the veto, coming now, could prove particularly
damaging for the Republican candidates for governor in Virginia and
New Jersey, the two states with races this fall in which abortion
has been successfully used by pro-choice Democrats against
anti-abortion Republicans.
   The bill next goes to the Senate for agreement on a separate
provision.
   Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research
Council and a former policy adviser in the Reagan administration,
predicted that following a veto, conservatives would attempt ``to
work out something ... that wouldn't give the right-to-life people
heartburn and at the same time allow the pro-choice groups to claim
some progress.''
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, said Bush's position on the bill is
consistent, although it has changed somewhat since he first ran for
president in 1980.
   Bush, he said, opposes abortion except in the cases of rape,
incest or when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. But he
supports federal financing of abortion only in cases where the
mother's life is in danger.
   Asked why Bush makes a distinction, Fitzwater said he was
concerned that women would use rape or incest as a pretext to get
federally financed abortions and therefore ``you have no
restrictions at all. ... That's why the president has a federal
funding position that's somewhat different than his moral belief.''

   A man shot his ex-lover and their two
children to death Monday, then set fire to the house and killed
himself, police said. A device resembling a bomb was found in the
gunman's pocket.
   The device, discovered after the gunman's body was taken to the
medical examiner's office, prompted the evacuation of the office
for about an hour while a bomb squad removed it.
   ``They found what appears to be a homemade bomb,'' said homicide
Lt. Joseph W. Witte. ``It's a tube of smokeless powder with some
sort of detonator.''
   Police had not determined whether the device could have
exploded, he said.
   Daniel Wright, 37, apparently broke into the house shortly
before 6 a.m., shot the woman and two children, set the fire and
committed suicide, Witte said.
   Firefighters found the house filled with tear gas when they
arrived, according to the lieutenant. They found a tear-gas
canister in a second-floor hallway, near the rear bedroom where the
bodies of Wright, Daniel Rivera, 7, and Maurice Rivera, 4, were
found, Witte said.
   The boys' mother, 29-year-old Agnes Rivera, was found on the
first floor in a small bathroom at the bottom of a stairway, Witte
said.
   ``Our theory is that she was shot at the top of the steps and
fell into the bathroom,'' Witte said.
   Authorities believe Wright set off the tear-gas canister, Witte
said.
   Three adults and a child who also occupied the house escaped
without injury, Witte said. The child and two adults went out the
front door, and the third adult was rescued from the roof.
   Wright apparently set the blaze in the second-floor bedroom,
Witte said. The house sustained mostly smoke and water damage on
the second floor.
   Police found a .30-30-caliber rifle in the bedroom. Police
estimated it had been fired five or six times.
   Wright and Ms. Rivera's common-law marriage ended about a month
ago, Witte said. Ms. Rivera threw him out of the house.
   Neighbors and relatives said there had been tension between
Wright and Ms. Rivera for some time.
   ``He was always threatening her,'' said Ms. Rivera's uncle,
Hector Rivera. ``He said if they would ever break up, he would kill
her.''

   A Red Cross team arrived Monday to
help trace missing people and provide humanitarian aid on this
island nation where 13 more deaths from a Sinhalese uprising were
reported.
   The Red Cross team came from Switzerland after an invitation
last week from President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   He invited the team following charges by opposition politicians
that pro-government death squads were killing sympathizers of an
underground group trying to overthrow the government.
   The government has denied the charge. It blames the People's
Liberation Front, the ultranationalist Sinhalese group that
advocates overthrowing the government, for most of the 5,000
killings the past two years.
   Human rights activists and opposition politicians welcomed
Premadasa's invitation to the Red Cross. But some said they feared
it was prompted by economic concerns, noting that major Western aid
donors are to meet in Paris this week to consider Sri Lanka's $750
million request for foreign help.
   Members of the four-member Red Cross team from Geneva refused to
speak to reporters. Their duties are expected to include visiting
detention centers.
   Also Monday, the government said its troops shot and killed two
Sinhalese extremists who tried to escape arrest in Matara, 85 miles
southeast of Colombo.
   Other killings reported the previous 24 hours included two
Sinhalese youths whose bodies were found in Kandy, 55 miles east of
Colombo.
   Nine Sinhalese civilians died in three separate attacks by
Sinhalese extremists in southern and central Sri Lanka, a
government communique said.
   It also said two Sinhalese Buddhist monks had been abducted by
unknown gunmen.
   The People's Liberation Front has accused the
Sinhalese-dominated government of giving too many concessions to
members of the Tamil minority, whose own ethnic war has claimed
11,000 lives since the Tamil separatist insurrection began in 1983.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise
18 percent.

   Two of three Colombians extradited to the
United States on drug charges over the weekend were ordered held
without bond Monday during hearings held under tight security.
   The three were brought to this country together, then
transported separately to Miami, Orlando and Detroit to face
charges in those cities.
   Ana Rodriguez de Tamayo, 50, was dropped off in Miami and
appeared before U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo on Monday. He ordered
her held without bond and set another hearing for Friday.
   In Orlando, Roberto Carlini-Arrico, 38, an ex-Florida resident
who fled to Colombia after a 1986 indictment on state charges of
drug trafficking, was also ordered held without bond to await a
federal trial with his mother, a brother and a sister. They are
jailed in central Florida.
   The third person taken Saturday from Colombia, Bernardo Pelaez
Roldan, 44, was transported to Detroit, where he was convicted in
absentia in March 1984 of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute cocaine.
   The extraditions brought to four the number of people hauled out
of Colombia since President Virgilio Barco imposed emergency
measures against drug traffickers Aug. 18. Eduardo Martinez Romero
was taken to Atlanta on Sept. 6 to face money-laundering charges
brought in March.
   Mrs. Rodriguez is charged in a 1983 indictment with conspiracy
to import cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to
distribute. If convicted on both counts, she faces up to 30 years
in federal prison and $50,000 in fines.
   Seventeen others were charged in the indictment, including at
least three members of the Bolivian military. Eleven are still
fugitives and six have either been convicted or pleaded guilty,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan.
   Carlini, according to the 1986 indictment, was a distributor for
thousands of pounds of cocaine that entered south Florida through a
Colombia-Bahamas-Florida supply network during the mid-80s.
   He was extradited after a federal grand jury in Orlando last
month charged him with conspiracy to import and distribute 7,000
pounds of marijuana between November 1988 and August 1989. Carlini
faces up to life in prison and $4 million in fines if convicted.
   ``This case shows that our investigation and charging of
Colombian defendants can lead to their extradition to face justice
in the United States,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman, who
called Carlini ``a significant defendant'' in the federal drug
crackdown.
   Another of Roberto Carlini's brothers, Paulo, and a cousin who
identified herself as Susana, attended the magistrate's hearing in
Orlando and told reporters their family was being harassed on
flimsy charges.
   ``Don't worry, Roberto, we are with you,'' Susana told her
cousin before the hearing began. ``This is all a show.''
   Carlini is to be arraigned Wednesday.
   Mrs. Rodriguez's hearing was moved from a magistrate's hearing
room to a courtroom at U.S. District Court for security reasons.
The courtroom was ringed by U.S. marshals and a metal detector was
temporarily installed outside.
   ``In view of the threats made in Colombia by the cartels, we are
taking every precaution,'' U.S. Marshal Daniel Horgan said.

<HEAD>Bullwinkle Creator Remembered as a Man Who Lived to Have Fun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay Ward, the creator of such wacky,
witty cartoon characters as Bullwinkle and Rocky the flying
squirrel, was remembered Monday as a man who just wanted to have
fun.
   ``The guiding force of Jay's life was the fun principle,'' said
Bill Hurtz, a senior director at Jay Ward Productions since the
1950s. ``If it wasn't fun to do, he wouldn't do it.''
   Hurtz was one of seven people who spoke at Ward's noontime
memorial service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park about 10 miles north
of downtown Los Angeles.
   Ward, the creator of such hugely popular television cartoon
stars as Rocket J. Squirrel (aka Rocky), Bullwinkle Moose, Crusader
Rabbit and Dudley Do-Right, died Thursday of kidney cancer. He was
69.
   ``My memories are tripping the light fantastic,'' said June
Foray, the voice of Rocky, as she recalled the good times working
with Ward.
   She told how Ward once turned the grand ballroom of New York
City's Plaza Hotel into a park _ complete with grass, ants,
pickpockets and fortune tellers _ for a picnic.
   Ward, a huge man with a Walrus mustache who was intensely shy
away from friends, never set out to be a television cartoon creator.
   Instead, he opened a real estate office in his hometown of
Berkeley after earning a master's degree from Harvard Business
School.
   But a truck careened into the office on his first day and broke
both Ward's legs.
   During his convalescence he and Alex Anderson created Crusader
Rabbit, who in 1949 became the star of the first cartoon show made
expressly for television.
   A decade later, Ward and his late partner Bill Scott brought
Rocky and Bullwinkle to the small screen in shows that quickly
became adored by both adults and children.
   ``Rocky and His Friends'' ran on ABC from 1959 through 1961 and
``The Bullwinkle Show,'' believed to be the first prime-time
cartoon show for network television, was carried by NBC for several
years before going into syndication.
   The puns came fast and furious on both shows as dimwitted hero
Dudley Do-Right somehow always managed to rescue Little Nell and
bumbling spies Boris Badanov and Natasha Fatale set out week after
to week to ``get moose and squirrel.''
   Throughout it all, friends recalled Monday, Ward carried forth
his philosophy of fun.
   ``It wasn't what he produced, but how he lived, that made Jay
special, bringing joy to people's lives,'' said childhood friend
Luther Nichols.

<TEXT>
   Delegates from 91 nations agreed on
Monday to place African elephants on the endangered list and halt
trade in ivory, but five African nations immediately declared they
would keep selling ivory anyway.
   The last-minute proposal, which passed 76-11 with 4 abstentions,
allowed southern African nations to apply for exemptions to a
special panel of experts.
   The vote came at a meeting of the Convention on Trade in
Endangered Species, or CITES, and drew a loud cheer from
environmentalists and delegates pushing for a ban.
   The conference also is discussing 300 endangered plants and
animals in its biennial session, although the focus was on
elephants.
   The measure agreed to on Monday must be confirmed in a full
session before the 10-day gathering ends Friday but delegates
called that a formality.
   It amounts to at least a two-year ban because no exemptions are
likely to be considered before the next CITES meeting.
   ``We think this was a good compromise, a place to work from,''
said Conny Harriman, head of the U.S. delegation that championed
East Africa's bid for a total ban.
   ``I think it's great,'' said John Grandy of the Humane Society
of the United States.
   Costa Mlay, Tanzania's director of wildlife, said East Africans
were satisfied. ``This is the best we could do, now we must try to
work together.''
   Shirley MacGreal, of the International Primate Protection
League, based in Summerville, N.C., raised her fist in victory when
asked for her reaction. ``This is wonderful,'' she said.
   But Rowan Martin, director of research for Zimbabwe's Wildlife
Department, was bitter.
   ``This is a great Pyrrhic,'' he said. ``They forced seven
countries who seemed to be doing well at conservation out of the
convention. ''
   Under CITES rules, members can declare reservations within 90
days, allowing them to trade with any other CITES states declaring
exemptions or with non-CITES members.
   Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana and Burundi _ whose lands
contain about one-tenth of the African elephant herd _ said they
would file for exemptions.
   Japan, which has regularly consumed about 40 percent of world
ivory exports, declined comment. ``Our attitude will be determined
in Tokyo,'' acting delegation head Kiyohiko Arafuni told reporters.
   Ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stamps
popular in many Asian nations and for jewelry, piano keys and
carvings.
   Martin said southern Africans would have no trouble finding
markets even without Japan.
   ``That's the crazy part,'' he said. ``There are 67 non-parties
to the convention. Think of all those Arab states that would be
happy to take over all that trade.''
   He blamed the vote on American activists, describing them as
``fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thing
about African reality.''
   Environmentalists' reactions ranged from guarded optimism to
euphoria. They had lobbied hard to block any compromise which would
let southern Africa keep its elephants on the threatened list _
Appendix II, which allows limited trade in elephant products _
while the rest were moved to Appendix I, the endangered list, which
forbids all such trade.
   ``This sends a single message to the world,'' said Cynthia Moss
of the African Wildlife Foundation, author of ``Elephant Memories.''
   ``A split listing would have made people think there is good
ivory and bad ivory,'' she said.'' Now there is no question.''
   Jeff Canin of Greenpeace International hailed the vote but
called it only a first step toward protecting the elephant. He said
the main thing was to persuade people to stop buying invory.
   A recent census estimated Africa now has just over 600,000
elephants. A decade ago it was l.3 million.
   Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa argued that their own
anti-poaching measures and management had increased herds, forcing
them to cull elephants for ecological balance.
   The sale of ivory from culled elephants contributes millions of
dollars to their wildlife management budgets, they said.
   The compromise, proposed by Somalia, followed a failed attempt
for an outright ban. The United States, Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia,
Austria and Hungary proposed that all African elephants be shifted
to Appendix I without exceptions. That vote was 53-36, lacking the
required two-thirds majority.
   Desmond Bradley Martin, a Kenya-based American expert, estimated
it would now take at least $100 million a year to save major
populations in Africa.
   ``African countries have to expand anti-poaching patrols and
intelligence gathering,'' he said. ``If international funds are not
made available, many elephant populations will decline
drastically.''
   After the session, CITES Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe of
Canada shrugged off criticism of his activities.
   He said the U.S. delegation's request for an accounting of
$85,000 from the sale by CITES of South American caiman skins was
the sort of request for information a member state was entitled to
ask.
   ``This is not the first time a government has asked the
secretariat what happened in a specific case,'' Lapointe said.
   He attributed harsh criticism from environmentalist groups,
including a request for police investigation, to a misunderstanding
of CITES functions.
   ``I am still sleeping easily at night,'' Lapointe said.

<TEXT>
   A study shows that America's cities are
starving for trees, forestry experts said Monday.
   Most cities in the United States could accommodate more than
twice the number of trees that now line their streets, said James
Kielbaso, a forestry professor from Michigan State University.
Those cities are missing out on the cooling and energy-saving
benefits that trees provide, he said.
   Kielbaso was one of the lead researchers in a recent study by
the American Forestry Association, which was released at the
organization's fourth Urban Forest Conference. About 500 tree
experts and activists attended the meeting.
   ``If we double the number of trees in our cities, we would, in
effect, triple the environmental benefits of trees,'' Kielbaso said.
   The study was compiled from the results of a random survey of
street trees in about 300 communities in the United States,
Kielbaso said.
   There are an estimated 60 million street trees in the country,
Kielbaso said. There are an average of 78 street trees per mile, he
said, spaced an average of 150 feet apart.
   Kielbaso said that decreasing the space between each tree to 50
feet would allow for nearly 100 million new street trees.
   A previous study found that street trees make up only one-tenth
of the urban forest in the nation's cities, he said. Yet they play
an important role in providing shade and other benefits to city
dwellers.
   Kielbaso said that among the conclusions of his study was that
only half of 1 percent of city budgets are spent on trees.
Underfunded tree maintenance programs and difficult growing
conditions lead to early mortality rates for trees, he said.
   Most street trees are small _ two-thirds are under 12 inches in
diameter, and most medium to large trees are in fair to poor
condition, he said.
   Gary Moll, the AFA's vice president of urban forestry, said that
urban forests have been overlooked too often as ways to help slow
global warming.
   ``Research is just now beginning to show the environmental and
economic value of our urban forests,'' Moll said.
   The AFA has launched a citizens' tree-planting campaign called
Global ReLeaf, which is aimed at getting 100 million trees planted
in the nation's communities by 1992.

   A bomb placed under the driver's seat blew
up as a young Saudi Arabian diplomat was driving to work Monday,
blasting him out of the car and shredding both his legs, officials
and news reports said.
   No one claimed responsibility, but a police investigator said,
``The attack was the work of professionals.''
   Abdulrahman Shrewi, 28, an accountant in the military attache's
office, was rushed to Hacettepe University Hospital, where surgeons
amputated both legs at the knee.
   Hospital director Celik Taser said Shrewi was in stable
condition.
   The investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
device _ probably a time bomb _ exploded as Shrewi was driving
through Ankara's affluent Cankaya district.
   Passers-by bundled the diplomat into another car and he was sped
to the hospital.
   Shrewi's car caught fire after the explosion, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency quoted witnesses as saying.
   Saudi envoy Abdulaziz Khojah said Shrewi was posted in Turkey
four years ago and received no threats before the attack.
   It was the second attack on a Saudi diplomat in Ankara, the
capital, in a year. In October 1988, Saudi Embassy employee
Abdulgawi Bedawi was shot and killed in front of his home.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad in Hijaz claimed
responsibility for that killing. The group, unknown until then, was
believed made up of Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.

   The USS Samuel B. Roberts, a
guided-missile frigate that nearly sank last year after striking a
mine in the Persian Gulf, was returned to the Navy in a ceremony
Monday.
   The ceremony was held aboard the ship at Bath Iron Works'
shipyard.
   The 3,700-ton ship, which was built by the shipyard, ran into
the mine while escorting an oil tanker through the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq war. The explosion ripped a 9-foot hole in the
frigate's bottom and a 21-foot-long crack in the side.
   The Navy is tentatively scheduled to take the Roberts to its
home port of Newport, R.I., next Monday. The ship then will go to
the Caribbean for a year of ocean exercises.
   The 13 months of repairs cost about $37.5 million, $3.5 million
less than budgeted, officials said.

   More than 7,000 hackers tried but failed to gain
access to a computer outfitted with a new security system in a
contest sponsored by the system's manufacturer, the company said
Monday.
   The weeklong contest ended Monday without any unauthorized
computer access, said officials of LeeMah DataCom Security Corp., a
Hayward, Calif.-based company which issued its public challenge
Oct. 9 to hackers across the country.
   The company offered a trip for two to St. Moritz, Switzerland,
or Tahiti to anyone who could retrieve a message stored in a
protected computer in the offices of KPMG Peat Marwick, a
consulting firm here.
   ``We have examined the audit printout and found that the
computer received a total of 7,476 calls and that the LeeMah
TraqNet successfully prevented any unauthorized computer access,''
said Brad Jude, manager of telecommunications security at Peat
Marwick.
   LeeMah said the odds against a hacker's penetrating the system
are about 1 in 72 quadrillion.

   Automatic federal spending cuts totaling $16
billion take effect today, with a single stroke of President Bush's
pen, following the failure of Congress and the president to agree
on a deficit-reduction plan.
   The cuts mandated under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law
formally become permanent when Bush, as required, signs an order
activating them.
   The reductions, spread evenly across many defense and domestic
programs, are expected to total about $8.1 billion for defense and
$8.1 billion for domestic initiatives. That works out to reductions
of about 4.3 percent in defense programs and 5.3 percent in
domestic agencies.
   The cuts are expected to be rolled back as soon as Congress
works out a compromise deficit-reduction bill. The Senate approved
its version of the measure late Friday, and House-Senate
negotiators could begin their meetings this week.

   President Bush provided reassuring words
Monday in an effort to calm gyrating financial markets while the
Federal Reserve backed up the words with $2 billion in cash poured
into the U.S. banking system.
   The Fed's supply of cash was viewed as a sizable effort on the
part of the central bank to contain the Friday the 13th stock
market plunge and make sure it did not have disastrous ripple
effects through the rest of the economy.
   Private economists gave Fed officials high marks for their
handling of the matter, praising the speed with which the Fed
played a key role in helping to calm the market jitters.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after suffering a

   The White House prepared an order for
President Bush to sign Monday slashing $16.1 billion from the
federal budget that Congress had been unable to cut on its own.
Budget chief Richard Darman said, ``We are doing what the law
requires.''
   The only hope for averting the cuts _ imposed automatically by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law _ was for the House and Senate
to agree to a compromise budget-cutting bill and send it to Bush
for his signature by midnight.
   Such quick work was made virtually impossible by the situation
on Capitol Hill. The House version of the measure was studded with
dozens of controversial provisions _ ranging from Bush's cherished
capital gains tax cut to an expansion of child care services _ and
many lawmakers were out of town.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would

   President Bush's plan to curb chemical weapons
raised concerns in Congress on Monday and may anger other nations
because it could affect a multilateral pact already partially
negotiated.
   The changes apparently would give the United States the right to
continue producing chemical weapons after the treaty was signed,
and would allow the United States to maintain a portion of its
stockpile until all nations capable of making chemical weapons sign
the proposed treaty.
   The shift ``is going to cause a little commotion in the
negotiations,'' said an administration arms control expert who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It will cause us difficulties in
Geneva,'' where the multilateral negotiations are under way.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that ``unless
the president clarifies his position on this issue _ makes a
decision and makes it known _ it is likely that little progress
will be made in Geneva toward achieving the multilateral treaty
prohibiting chemical weapons which the president, ironically, has
stated is one of his highest priorities.''

   You are driving to Iron River, Mich., for the
annual Ferrous Frolics. You know that you'll never make it to
Ishpeming County on an empty stomach; you know that a stop at Bob's
Belly Busters could be fatal.
   What is a gas-guzzling gastronome to do?
   Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller suggest that you mix three
tablespoons of Dijon mustard, two tablespoons of dry white wine, a
half cup of minced red onion, two teaspoons of dried rosemary and
salt and pepper. Spread on a butterflied pork tenderloin; wrap in
foil.
   Then stick it in your car engine and drive 250 miles.
   Voila!
   ``It really does taste very good, smells wonderfully when you're
driving along and get to a toll booth,'' said Scheller, co-author
of ``Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only! Guide to Cooking on Your
Car Engine'' ($7.95; Villard Books).
   ``It gives you a great sense of accomplishment to do something
as formidable as a pork tenderloin,'' agrees his partner, Maynard.
   Think of Maynard, a 39-year-old travel writer, as the James
Beard of the Buick; think of Scheller, a 41-year-old photographer,
as the Paul Prudhomme of the Pontiac. Together they have produced a
compendium that gives new meaning to the phrase ``meals on wheels.''
   The two friends have been cooking on car engines since the
summer of 1984, when they were returning from a canoe trip in
Canada and got a hankering for some of that good smoked meat from
Schwartz's deli in Montreal.
   A quick detour later, they had their pastrami. But they also
were vaguely discontented _ wouldn't it be nice to savor a HOT
smoked meat sandwich?
   In Burlington, Vt., they pulled off the interstate and opened
the hood of Scheller's 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit. They spied a nice
spot under the air filter, and stuck the foil-wrapped meat there.
   An hour later, at a rest stop, they enjoyed steaming smoked meat.
   ``Best of all,'' they write, ``we nearly made two women at the
next picnic table choke on their sprouts when they saw that instead
of a busted fan belt, we had actually just dragged our lunch from
the Rabbit's greasy maw.''
   That started their fascination with car cuisine. They have spent
the past five years developing recipes _ Thruway Thighs, To
Grandmother's House Road Turkey, Blackened Roadfish and Lead Foot
Stuffed Cabbage, among them.
   Each recipe includes the estimated mileage required to cook the
meal. For those who are not zipping along Route 80 _ who are
stalled on, say, Philadelphia's Schuylkill Expressway _ the authors
provide cooking times.
   A lot depends on the size of the car's engine, and whether the
car has a commodious and secure place to put comestibles, a place
where the food will not be crushed or wedged into the engine's
moving parts or knocked to the ground to become road pizza.
   ``You try to retrieve an eggplant in traffic, and we're not
responsible,'' warn the authors.
   Exhaust manifolds are good; so are injector housings. Maynard
and Scheller compare the culinary virtues of different cars,
ranging from the 1965 Jaguar XK-E (``the best setup we have ever
come across for easy-access, top-of-the-engine cooking'') to the
1988 Toyota Camry, which offers a space next to the right wheel
well that functions as a bun warmer.
   Since the Japanese culture ``places no great stock in baked
goods, we can only assume that this was yet another canny ploy to
play to the American market,'' Maynard and Scheller write.
   Through it all, there is an emphasis on safety _ partly at the
insistence of the publishers' lawyers. Do not interfere with moving
parts or block the flow of air or insert, check or remove food with
the motor running. ``Come back with the same number of fingers you
started with,'' the authors say.
   Also, wrap the food three times in aluminum foil, and don't use
too much liquid. ``No car owner's manual calls for basting the
engine.''
   Scheller says a lot of people have reacted to the concept of car
cooking with a wince, convinced that ``under the hood there's some
indescribable collection of gunky parts that would ruin food.''
   The authors calmly explain that the food is wrapped, so engine
grime in no problem. And exhaust fumes are channeled outside,
through the exhaust pipe.
   Do Maynard and Scheller really cook this way? They insist they
do.
   ``It's a nice way to have a hot meal waiting somewhere down the
road,'' says Maynard. ``We don't do it all the time, of course.
When we're driving to a restaurant, for example, it's hard to
justify bringing food along.''
   And Maynard and Scheller do not suggest that all foods are
appropriately cooked in a Nissan Sentra. ``We once boned a whole
capon, stuffed it with alternating layers of chicken mousseline,
duxelles and spinach souffle, and wrapped it in brioche. But we had
the good sense to cook it in an oven, not on a car engine,'' they
write.
   Other recipes, they say, just don't pay off.
   ``For instance, you could bake a potato on a car engine, but
you'd have to drive to Des Moines,'' Maynard says. ``When you're
all done, you have a baked potato. So what.''

   Every working day, nearly 2,000 Lebanese
pass through four ``Good Fence'' border crossings on their way to
jobs in Israel.
   In doing so, these Lebanese Christians, Moslems and Druse
contribute to Israel's security and are a sign of growing ties
between Israel and southern Lebanon, where the Israelis have
established a security zone.
   Israeli analysts said the loyalty of the 200,000 Lebanese
residents of the security zone, created as a buffer against
Palestinian and Lebanese Moslem militias, would weaken if
widespread unemployment took hold in the area.
   ``The security zone is relatively quiet mainly because of the
sense that economic stability prevails. There's too much for the
people to lose,'' said Yosef Olmert, a Middle East expert at Tel
Aviv University.
   An Israeli army official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a requirement for entry for Lebanese workers was having a
relative serving in the South Lebanon Army, a 2,500-member
Christian-led militia that is trained and armed by Israel to help
defend the frontier.
   The security zone is about 75 miles long and 2{ to 12 miles
deep. It was established in 1985 after Israel withdrew from Lebanon
following a three-year occupation. So far this year, 71 guerrillas
infiltrating the zone have been killed.
   Metulla's ``Good Fence'' is a cluster of buildings, a watchtower
and a fence next to an Israeli army post. Workers show identity
cards, present work permits and empty their pockets in a check for
contraband.
   ``We all are running away from the war in Lebanon, and we are
here to work,'' Nadeen Badawi, 23, said after driving from the
Druse town of Hasbaya, 11 miles north of the border.
   Arriving about sunrise, he works Sunday through Friday at an
Israeli textile factory.
   Awaiting a chartered bus to another factory, a 48-year-old
Lebanese Christian said most of the workers earn the equivalent of
$17 a day.
   ``Most of the men are working in agriculture. A few, like me,
work in factories,'' said the former electronics technician who
declined to give his name for fear of reprisals.
   Some Lebanese complained the Israeli wages are too low but most
conceded they could do no better in Lebanon, where purchasing power
has been steadily eroded by inflation and the average monthly wage
is the equivalent of $75.
   Israeli officials say 1,500 to 2,000 Lebanese workers now enter
the country daily compared to only a few hundred in past years.
   Half are women who work in hotels, restaurants and as
housekeepers.
   Men generally take jobs in factories or on farms, where extra
money can be made during harvests. Skilled automobile mechanics are
also in demand. Most return home nightly, but some are provided
with housing for stays of up to several weeks.
   Israel provided about $1.3 million for road repairs last year in
southern Lebanon, in addition to funds for schools and hospitals
and salary supplements for city hall bureaucrats and police.
   ``In areas where the central government in Lebanon should have
built infrastructure and promoted social activity and education,
and didn't take care of it, we are taking care of it,'' said Uri
Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for Lebanon policy.
   He recently opened a new crossing primarily for Shiite Moslems.
   Although Iran has a strong influence among the Shiites, Lubrani
predicted 300 to 400 would cross daily and that the number would
increase.
   The Israeli shekel currency also has begun to circulate in
southern Lebanon along with the U.S. dollar and the Lebanese lira.
   Frances Rizk, a Lebanese official of the Christian Voice of Hope
radio, estimated trade at $2 million a month, with Israel providing
agricultural products and the Lebanese providing labor.
   ``Our financial situation is still the best in all of Lebanon,''
Rizk said.
   Officials say Israel would withdraw if Syria pulled out its
40,000 troops out of Lebanon and a government was established in
Beirut that could maintain peace throughout the country.
   ``Israel has no territorial claims on Lebanon,'' said Yossi
Amihud, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. Israel's concern is
``preventing the organization of terror and the use of Lebanese
territory for acts against Israel,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHANARAL, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its waters classified as
``biologically dead'' and its Pacific beach turned a yellow-green,
this former fishing community wants a small slice of Chile's copper
fortune to compensate for a shoreline buried in toxic sludge.
   It's not the first time Chanaral's 12,700 inhabitants have
played David to the Goliath of the state copper mining corporation,
which is by far the country's largest single company and producer
of more than a third of Chile's $8 billion in annual export
earnings.
   A year ago, the Chanaral Citizens' Committee won a legal suit
against the corporation, known by the acronym Codelco. The Supreme
Court ordered Codelco to shut down a 100-mile sluice that has
carried millions of tons of waste westward from its massive El
Salvador mine in the Andes to the Pacific coast at Chanaral.
   Such environmental victories are rare in Latin America and the
Third World in general, where governments, trailing in the
worldwide race for development, generally give priority to
industrial growth over damage to nature.
   But ecological awareness and activism has begun taking root in
Latin America, with new environmental and naturalist groups
emerging and becoming increasingly vocal.
   Nowhere is that awareness more manifest than in Chanaral, 605
miles north of Santiago, Chile's capital.
   The Citizens' Committee is supported by a rainbow of local
social groups and threw a rousing street party complete with a
local rock band when the Supreme Court's ruling came down.
   Codelco was forced to start building another sluice from the El
Salvador pit to a remote, uninhabitated plain on the desert that
dominates northern Chile. The $13.5-million project has run into
delays, but the company promises to complete it early next year.
   With that legal victory under its belt, the citizens are seeking
more satisfaction.
   ``The state must compensate us, because the pollution buried our
fishing, maritime and port development for decades,'' said Julio
Palma, a truck driver who was a leader in promoting the original
suit.
   In a new damage suit being planned, the community will ask for
the equivalent of one U.S. cent for each pound of copper extracted
from El Salvador, Palma said. The money will create a town
development fund.
   For the delays in building the new sluice, which was supposed to
be completed in April, the Citizens' Committee is asking $1 million
in compensation.
   In the existing sluice's 51 years of operation, 200 million to
500 million tons of crushed rock and tainted water have been dumped
onto Chanaral's shore, Palma said.
   Scientific studies used in the committee's suit found waters and
marine life around the community contaminated with dangerous levels
of copper, zinc, molybdenum and arsenic, which is used in
extracting metal from ore.
   As far back as 1975, a marine biologist, Rolf Benhcke, said in a
study: ``The Chanaral beach is a biologically dead beach. ... It
has been impossible to detect a single living organism.''
   That same year, the sluice's mouth was moved from central
Chanaral to Palitos Cove, five miles to the north. But the
community's shore remains barren, and a band of unnatural
yellow-green runs parallel to the water.
   Over the decades the waste piled up and pushed the shoreline out
more than a mile. Buried in the process were commercial docks, a
three-story pier used by fishing boats and a shipwreck dating back
to the 1940s that used to attract tourists, residents said.
   Oldtimers like Amanda Venegas recall another era when ``there
were so many fish that, when we went bathing, they swam between our
legs.''
   Nonetheless, the community is proud of having successfully
closed the sluice down and believe it could signal something for
other Third World countries.
   ``The ruling is the most important in decades on ecological
issues, and creates a precedent for Latin America,'' said the
Citizens' Committee's lawyer, Rafael Asenjo.
   He said ecology groups in the Phillipines and Peru have asked
the committee for copies of the decision. So has a group in Canada,
although Canada it is not part of the Third World.

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Oct. 22, 1962, President Kennedy went on radio and television
to announce he had ordered U.S. air and naval forces to blockade
Cuba, following the discovery of Soviet missile bases on the
island. Kennedy demanded the Soviets dismantle the rocket sites.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the shorthand of government, the whole
business is called, quite simply, ``catastrophic.'' That turned out
to be a good choice of word.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 has itself proven
to be a political catastrophe. The program is a problem for the
members of Congress who approved it and now are in the process of
undoing their unpopular handiwork; for the administration that
first supported it and then fell silent; even for senior citizens'
lobbyists who endorsed the plan without anticipating the backlash.
   Now Congress is trying to figure out how and what to try to
salvage out of catastrophic, the insurance program elderly
Americans _ at least those who know how to get a message to
Washington _ apparently did not want and clearly did not want to
finance.
   While the White House at one point said the program should be
preserved, President Bush is offering no further advice. ``We are
letting the congressional process hash this out,'' Bush said Friday.
   The president said if Congress produced something he deemed
unsatisfactory, he would not hesitate to step in. The
administration iprompt it to take action, or even a position, on a
program Bush a candidate.
   After the House voted outright repeal, Secretary of Health and
Human Services Louis Sullivan endorsed a Senate measure that would
have pres the law and reduced the controversial surtax o that was
to have financed it.
   He did so ienate Finance Committee, but the administrationly
declared that Sullivan was speaking only forudget Director Richard
G. Darman sent up a letten. ``Nothing in this letter should be
construed for or opposition to one catastrophic illness substantive
amenas opposed to another,'' Darman decreed.
   The catastrophic overage act was supposed to provide insurance
to pay for costly hospital and doctor care, to put a cap on out-ket
medical costs. It also offered new benefits escription drug costs.
The benefits were to be phased in gradually.
   But the tax to pay for those benefits,ich already is in place,
produced the backlash. It is a surtax of $22.50 for every $150 in
fedd by the elderly. That spared low-income retirees, imposing the
surtax on about 40 percent of the people eligi the insurance. The
maximum tax is $800 a persoent of the elderly faced that top levy.
   Congress, which hadpected gratitude and support, reing the tax,
many of them already paying for their own catastrohic health
insurance. Even peoplo surtax came to believe that they'd be
assessed, and joined th opposition. The protection would have been
mostlower-income retired people, the least organizedvocal of the
nation's seniors.
   President Reprogram in the first place, but what he recommended
in 1987 was a relatively modest plan to prohuge medical bills, with
an estimated price tag of $2 billion ar.
   Congress added benefits, and costs. When enacted 16 months ago,
the five-year cost was estimated at $32The estimate now is up to
$48 billion.
   The Reagan plan was osed to be financed with a flat, $4 monthly
pre. To pay for the expanded program, Congress devised the 15
percent income tax surcharge that stirred the senior rebellion.
   Even the most powerful of the senior lobbies, the American
Association of Retired Persons, got tangled in the issue after
agreeing to go along with the financing system. The AARP now says,
somewhat defensively, that it strongly supports the benefits but
never advocated the surtax system. The association wants broader
financing,ng an increase in the tobacco tax. That's not likely.
   What is likely is that Congress will be far more wary of such
programs, and especially of such finaing systems, in the future.
And what's certain is that costs the program would have covered
will be paid in other ways _ out of pocket, in higher premiums for
private health insurance, and in taxes, local state and federal.
   In signing the bill he counted a major destic achievement,
Reagan nonetheless offered aand it proved too true. He said that
without dit controls, the program could be too expensive
   ``This could be more than a budget problem. ``It could be a
tragedy. The program, after ae paid for by the elderly themselves.
So we mushese new benefits or we'll harm the very people we are
trying t

<HEAD>The Market's Personality Has Changed Radically</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The stock market's volume today is many times
greater than it was two or three decades ago. Data and rumors
spread infinitely faster. The dollar power of the players is in
multiples of yesterday's.
   It is a very different place than its stereotyped view as a
public forum where people vote with their wallets, and which
reflects the hopes and fears of the American public.
   A one-day price collapse of more than 190 Dow Jones points is
shocking, but it is at least better understood in light of market
size, mechanics, liquidity, fads, trading patterns and devices, and
valuations.
   Anyone trying to understand today's volatile stock market might
consider:
   _There are always two separate activities involved. One is
relatively long-term investing on the basis of corporate values and
economic conditions. The other, in various forms, is playing the
market _ trying to outguess it.
   Are the values there?
   Price-earnings ratios, or the number of times earnings at which
a stock sells, have not been unusually high. The post-1950 average
P-E for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index is 12. Just prior to
Oct. 13 the P-E was 14.
   It's a different story when prices are matched against book
values. The S&amp;P before October 13 was about 2.4 times book value.
Since 1930, the valuation has been higher only once, just before
the 1987 crash.
   Investors must also consider stocks vs. bonds. In the 1980s the
bond market has averaged nearly a 13 percent annual return, best of
the century. That gives stocks competition for the investment
dollar.
   A statement early last week by Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan was widely interpreted as indicating the possibility of
higher interest rates, a move generally regarded as bad for stocks,
good for investors in debt issues.
   Adding to this fear was a report Friday that wholesale prices
were rising, and fears that September's consumer price index would,
when announced, add to fears that inflation, considered subdued,
might not yet have surrendered.
   _Recent advances in the stock market probably were generated
more by the prospects of corporate takeovers _ and a runup in
prices _ rather than basic values, primarily the earnings of
corporations.
   Corporate earnings have been fading. Earnings gains last year
for the Standard &amp; Poor's Composite Stock Index were 36 percent
over the previous year. In this year's first quarter the gain was
22 percent, in the second, 5 percent.
   Takeover activity can disguise such a deterioration because,
firstly, the excitement of takeover companies offering prices far
above market, and secondly, the elimination of stock through such
takeovers.
   In the years 1984-1988, a total of $369 billion of U.S. equities
was removed from the market, much of it replaced by debt. Fewer
shares, and more potential buyers, tends to push up prices.
   In contrast, during the years 1969-1983, newly issued stock
generally exceeded withdrawals by an average of $9 billion a year.
That is, the amount of stock on the market grew rather than shrank.
   Doubts about the continued ability to raise money by those
seeking to take over large corporations, and the ability of already
debt-ridden companies to continue making payments, deflated the
prices of the shares involved.
   _Today's trading techniques, as opposed to investing techniques,
might have much to do with price surges or collapses. The market
has been programmed with many automatic triggers, pulled by
computers - often simultaneously.
   The players trade in scores of millions of dollars.
Institutions, such as mutual and pension funds, trust departments,
foundations and more _ rather than individuals _ do most of the
trading.
   Do they think alike? Act alike? React to each other? To some
extent; how much is likely to be studied more intensely by those
concerned about the market's volatility.
   Exchanges usually deny it, but stock market liquidity appears to
be badly damaged. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why drops
of such magnitude as that of October 13, 1989, can occur.
   Liquidity means the ability to match buyers and sellers. Years
ago, individual investors made up a so-called randomness of views;
but institutions are often think alikes. As they rise in
importance, individuals shrink.
   In 1988 alone, household stock holdings shrank by $105 billion.
In the five years 1984-1988, individual investors cashed in a half
trillion dollars of blue chip stocks, much of which was replaced by
debt _ often rickety debt.
   Perhaps even worse, by cashing in they removed themselves as
voices in the marketplace _ a multiplicity of views, a randomness
of thinking that the market could use today.

   Scotland has its Loch Ness Monster, and England
has its crop-field rings.
   Perfectly neat swirls of flattened crops, 10 to 100 feet in
diameter, show up in the farmlands of southern England each year
and have intrigued researchers for a decade.
   The geometric formations, found amid otherwise undisturbed
crops, have yielded a maze of interpretations: electrically charged
spinning balls of air, tiny holes in the ozone layer, rutting deer,
flying saucers, helicopters flying upside down, herds of demented
hedgehogs rotating in unison.
   Tongue-in-cheek theorists say it would take 40,000 hedgehogs
running around at the same time to create the ``circle effect.''
   Hoaxes have been effectively ruled out: local military bases say
helicopters have difficulty flying upside down.
   If animals are to blame, they leave no trail of bent or broken
stems.
   Violent storms or whirlwinds don't create the precise patterns
of crops crushed flat with the tautness of thatch.
   Crops are never damaged and continue to ripen until harvest.
   More than 600 configurations have been recorded since 1980 in
fields of grass, barley, oats or wheat, as well as in stretches of
sand, soil or snow. Of this summer's 270, two-thirds appeared in a
square-mile zone near Avebury in Wiltshire's rural terrain,
including 28 in one field.
   At first, they were simple circles or had concentric ``Saturn''
rings. This year, one was ornamented with a long curling tail, like
a tadpole's. A ``Celtic Cross'' of four circles surrounding one
large middle circle looks like it might have been formed by the
landing pods of the standard-image alien spaceship.
   Terence Meaden, a physicist, is convinced they are caused by a
previously unknown vortex, an inverse ``dust devil'' that, instead
of sucking the surface, slams violently down into it.
   ``We've got a movable monster,'' Meaden said in an interview.
``The Scottish one seldom gets its head above water.''
   More than 4,000 people have reported see the Loch Ness monster
in modern times, and monster hunters have used everything from
bread crumbs to submarines to try to find the 1,400-year-old legend.
   The difference is that the monster rarely hangs around for long,
whereas the rings are there for all to see.
   Serious research into the circles mystery began in 1980, four
years after the first recorded sighting at Headbourne Worthy in
Hampshire. Chroniclers have now traced sporadic sightings as far
back as 1918, in countries as far apart as France, Canada and Japan.
   A circle 14 feet in diameter with a one-foot-wide outer ring,
appeared one morning this past August on Fred Cullimore's 190-acre
wheat farm near Bath in southwest England.
   ``It was absolutely perfect; there was no possibility of any
animal or person doing it,'' Cullimore said.
   He's not sure if he suspects people from outer space.
   ``I've never seriously entertained the idea of little green
men,'' he said. ``It's too frightening to think! But I'm not 100
percent certain it's storm-related.''
   Geoff Cooper, 52, said the rings have been proliferating on his
farm near Westbury in Wiltshire since 1980.
   ``It's the wind,'' he surmises. ``Having said that, has the
weather changed that much in the last nine years? I don't know.''
   Two new books on the phenomenon take opposite approaches _ one
scientific, one fantastical.
   In ``The Circle Effect And Its Mysteries,'' the physicist Meaden
speculates that an unusual atmospheric disturbance created by winds
passing over a hill in south England's undulating landscape creates
a spinning ball of air highly charged with electricity. It
eventually plunges downward and leaves its uniform mark, he thinks.
   He says witnesses have told of a vortex that gives off a humming
sound ``like the sound you get from electric power lines,'' and it
is luminous at night.
   Summer-long attempts to photograph the phenomenon have all been
in vain. One group of 50 scientists and engineers armed with
high-tech sensors and scanners settled down for a nightlong vigil
in June and, when dawn broke, discovered an elaborate pattern had
formed directly behind their camp.
   ``It was as though some intelligence was saying, `So you think
you can pin us down!''' says Pat Delgado, co-author of ``Circular
Evidence'' with electrical engineer Colin Andrews.
   Delgado, an electro-mechanical design engineer, is convinced
that by a process of elimination, ``what we are we left with is the
paranormal.''
   He estimates 4,000 pounds of pressure is needed to induce the
crop to lie flat ``and continue to grow and shed its seed in a
natural way.''
   The rapeseed plant ``snaps like celery'' when bent at the stem,
but in this instance, ``a softening procedure takes place and I
don't know what sort of energy can do that,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``Just imagine what you could do with this free energy if it
could be harnessed.''

<TEXT>
   When Sun Yat-sen, the father of modern China,
challenged the crumbling Manchu dynasty from exile nearly a century
ago he found support throughout the world from sympathetic ``hua
qiao'' _ overseas Chinese.
   Now, with the brutal military crushing of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing this past spring, a new generation of Chinese
exiles is looking to hua qiao for help in toppling China's leaders.
   Wang Gungwu, vice chancellor of the University of Hong Kong and
an expert on overseas Chinese, hears ``echoes from the past'' as he
surveys the situation. Survival will not be a problem for the new
exiles; they can expect to be sustained by their brethren abroad,
he says.
   The story of the hua qiao spans many centuries, as wave upon
wave of Chinese have left their native land to escape grinding
poverty, to flee political persecution, or just to seek fortune.
One estimate puts the current overseas Chinese population at
roughly 30 million.
   They can be found in every corner of the globe.
   Among them are world-famous architects (I.M. Pei), best-selling
novelists (Maxine Hong Kingston), and leaders of nations (Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore). They are prominent
businessmen, and every major city has restaurants run by them.
   But the overseas Chinese also have maintained ties to their
homeland, and at times some have become deeply involved in its
politics.
   The most obvious example was their support for Sun Yat-sen, a
leading figure in the fight against the Manchu dynasty that had
been in place since 1644 and was also known as the Qing dynasty. It
finally fell in 1911, with Sun as a leading player in China's
revolutionary movement until his death in 1925.
   In explaining why overseas Chinese supported Sun against the
weak Manchu empire, his biographer Harold Z. Schiffrin wrote: ``If
as minorities they were persecuted or discriminated against abroad,
they wanted a powerful home government for protection.''
   Sun owed a large debt to the overseas Chinese.
   ``Whenever he went overseas, he was looked after by the overseas
Chinese,'' said Wang of the University of Hong Kong. ``They clothed
him, fed him and protected him.''
   They also provided some financial backing, he added. ``The
support was vital. He couldn't have survived.''
   Other hua qiao have since answered appeals from Chinese leaders
for help.
   Soon after Mao Tse-tung's Communist Party took power in 1949, it
urged Chinese intellectuals living abroad to return and help build
``New China.''
   Although no reliable estimate is available on the number of
professionals who answered the call, thousands did return and
played a key role in China's development, especially nuclear
physicists. Many later paid the price during political purges of
intellectuals.
   The Chinese diaspora is once again in the spotlight because of
the spring pro-democracy demonstrations and the new exile movement
seeking help from the hua qiao.
   But the exiles have found that the overseas Chinese are not a
monolithic community. Their political and economic outlooks vary
widely. Perhaps the only common thread is that they are an ethnic
minority in almost every country in which they live.
   The degree of assimilation by Chinese abroad varies tremendously
and to some extent determines how closely tied they are to mainland
China affairs.
   Some of the most assimilated and the oldest overseas Chinese
communities are in Southeast Asia, where reaction to the
pro-democracy movement generally was muted.
   In Thailand, precise figures on the ethnic Chinese population
are difficult if not impossible to determine because of widespread
intermarriage since the first wave of migration more than 200 years
ago.
   But up to 12 percent of the population is believed to have solid
Chinese roots, including a dozen Chinese-Thai families that can be
said to largely run the private economy and the prime minister, who
has a Chinese-born grandfather.
   ``I was born here, my parents are Chinese from China, but I love
Thailand and I feel I belong to this country,'' said one ethnic
Chinese businessmen in Bangkok, the Thai capital. ``I have never
been to mainland China. I think that it would be very difficult to
live there.''
   Chinese in the Philippines, who began arriving even before the
Spanish colonizers in the late 16th century, also have assimilated
rapidly by intermarrying, taking Hispanic names and adopting Roman
Catholicism. They, too, are very influential in economic and
political life.

   North America and Europe also have their share of
long-established overseas Chinese communities. Ethnic Chinese first
arrived in the San Francisco area in the mid-1800s and now number
about 200,000. They sit on virtually all the major boards of the
city.
   Many of the ethnic Chinese in San Francisco and elsewhere in the
United States are only first- and second-generation Americans. The
1980 U.S. census found that of nearly 900,000 Americans reporting
Chinese ancestry more than half spoke Chinese at home. Nearly
300,000 people said they were born in China and 155,000 others
listed Taiwan and Hong Kong as their birth places.
   Wang believes the ``relative newcomers'' among Chinese-Americans
are ``much more likely to be sensitive to developments in China.''
   Indeed, many ethnic Chinese in North America have actively
backed the pro-democracy movement.
   The Chinese community of San Francisco organized several groups
in support of the Beijing students and staged dozens of rallies and
fund-raising dinners.
   Chinese-Americans in Chicago donated money to buy facsimile
machines, computers and other equipment for the pro-democracy
movement.
   In Toronto, as many as 30,000 people, many of them
Chinese-Canadians, demonstrated June 4 to protest the harsh
military crackdown on the Beijing students in Tiananmen Square. The
turnouts were considered extraordinary for the traditionally placid
community.
   Some Chinese-Canadians also strongly criticized the Canadian
government _ Foreign Secretary Joe Clark in particular _ for
approving a large loan to China in August.
   ``How can Joe Clark turn around and do that?'' said Tom Pang,
president of the Chinese Community Center. ``The blood on the
square is barely dry.''
   But support for the democracy movement among overseas Chinese in
the West was by no means universal.
   ``There are a number of Chinese entrepreneurs in London who
don't want to rock the boat, and in fact some of them have openly
condemned the democracy movement,'' said Anthony Shang, 36, a
television producer who has lived in the British capital for 20
years.
   He said that among the people who have adopted ``very cautious''
attitudes are some operators of the 6,000 Chinese restaurants and
supermarkets in Britain who buy foodstuffs from China.
   ``There is a degree of hypocrisy amongst the older community
leaders who are inevitably tied up with business,'' Shang added.
   To what degree, then, is there a sense of dual loyalty to both
China and the country in which the hua qiao live?
   ``If a white man asks me that, he's questioning my loyalty by
merely asking,'' said David Liu, chairman of the Chicago chapter of
the Washington-based Organization of Chinese Americans. ``It's an
insult. Why don't the Caucasians ask Russian immigrants about their
loyalty?''
   But Rolland Lowe, president of the Foundation for Chinese
Democracy in the San Francisco area, acknowledged that some hua
qiao have a conflict.
   ``They are Americans but somehow they think they are Chinese,''
he said.
   But he added: ``I keep my hat straight as to who I am.''
   That is to say, he is an American.

   Standing larger than life in front of the
Chenjinglun Middle School is a white marble statue of a man in a
three-piece suit.
   The $13,000 statue is of Chen Jinglun, a native son of Xinhui
county who built the school with part of the fortune he made as a
rice merchant in nearby Hong Kong.
   Behind the statue is an Olympic-size swimming pool, a gymnasium
and classrooms filled with bright-eyed students, some hunched over
expensive computerized typewriters _ all far more advanced that the
usual Chinese school.
   ``To show respect to Mr. Chen, the local government and people
of Xinhui named the school after him,'' said Guan Yunjin, the
school president. ``The love from Mr. Chen is very precious.''
   Chen's largesse is just one example of the historically strong
ties between Chinese who move abroad and their motherland _ in
particular this coastal region of southern China, which is the
ancestral home to hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese.
   Jiangmen, a region in the Pearl River delta, prides itself as
the ``hometown of overseas Chinese.'
   A main reason for the world-wandering ways of Jiangmen Chinese
has to do with the region's proximity to Hong Kong, the British
colony from which shipping lines lead to all corners of the globe.
   About 2.58 million Chinese living in 95 countries, Hong Kong and
the nearby Portuguese territory of Macao trace their roots to
Jiangmen. Many of them return to visit relatives, to donate money
for social services or to invest in local enterprises.
   In nearby Taishan country, a bridge has been built with $940,000
in contributions from native Chinese now living abroad. Springing
up throughout the countryside are three- and four-story villas
built by overseas Chinese for relatives still here.
   A museum with pictures of Chinese in the California Gold Rush of
1849 also has a list of about 100 local schools that have received
donations from Chinese abroad.
   Feng Yuanchao, director of a local Foreign Affairs Office, runs
down the list of North American cities where his kin can be found _
Vancouver, Seattle, Toronto and Chicago.
   As he drives past rice fields in his small van, he points to a
village of low, gray-brick homes in the distance.
   ``That village has sent many people to Chicago,'' he says. ``If
you meet a Chinese in Chicago's Chinatown, the chances are 60
percent'' he is from the town.
   Some overseas Chinese come back for more than a visit.
   One is Tommy Quan, 56, who left Taishan in 1949, when the
Chinese Communists came to power. He made Seattle his home and
became a successful businessman.
   But when he returned in the early 1980s, he found the land
barren. ``I kept asking myself, `Why don't people do something
about it?'''
   Quan did. He established a 400-acre orange orchard that now
employs about 150 people. He spent seven months in China this year
and will spend almost half of 1990 to see his business through its
first critical years.
   Local officials are appreciative of efforts by Quan and other
overseas Chinese to help the Jiangmen area blossom and seem
unconcerned about the possibility of contamination by ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' the Communist term for unwanted liberal Western
influences.
   ``I'll put it this way,'' said Guan, the school president.
``Wherever they go, the Chinese love their hometown and country.
When they get rich they won't forget their country or hometown.
This is one of the merits of the Chinese people.''

   President Bush's $7.9 billion war on drugs in the
United States has raised official fears in Western Europe that
cocaine barons will broaden their already-expanding market on the
continent. Some officials say terrorists may be drawn into the
lucrative trade to finance their own causes.
   So far the streets of Europe have been largely spared the
cocaine storm that has buried the United States, where seizures of
the drug now are sometimes weighed in tons.
   Among those who fear the blizzard will now hit Europe is Antonio
Gava, Italy's interior minister.
   Gava said he supports the U.S. measures and cooperates with
American officials but is alarmed about Italy and its neighbors.
   ``All of Europe must have a heightened capacity for the battle
to keep the tentacles of drugs from spreading on this continent
during the massive effort by the United States,'' Gava said.
   Many other European leaders, such as Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain, also support the U.S. crackdown, but some also
share Gava's concern.
   ``The drug cartels in Latin America have shifted their strategy
toward Europe because of increased anti-drug activity by the United
States,'' said Karl-Heinz Lenhard, the chief of the Bavarian state
criminal police in West Germany.
   Lenhard's investigators last August made the largest cocaine
bust of the year in Europe, seizing 1,430 pounds valued at $108
million.
   ``Don't compare seizures with the United States,'' said one
European investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Europe
may be 10 years behind the United States, but cocaine is already a
major problem in Europe.'' Authorities from Scandinavia to the
Mediterranean say cocaine seizures doubled or tripled in the last
few years. Last year, European authorities seized 15,400 pounds of
cocaine, and nobody knows how much entered the continent undetected.
   In Portugal, the amount taken in the first eight months of this
year totaled 1,450 pounds, double that for 1988 and triple that of
1987.
   Gava fears the consequences of new and enormous cocaine profits
for Italy's underworld _ the Sicilian Mafia and Naple's Camorra. He
also points to what he says is evidence of some Mafia cooperation
with terrorists, whom he fears may turn to drug trafficking to
finance their activities.
   A high-ranking drug agent, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said investigators share the fear that terrorists might
run drugs themselves or turn to traffickers for money.
   Italy's underworld bosses control a worldwide drug trafficking
network that rakes in an estimated $20 billion a year. That figure
exceeds the national budgets of some small European countries, but
investigators believe it is dwarfed by the profits of the cocaine
cartels.
   Investigators say the cartels already work with the Mafia and
Camorra to distribute cocaine that usually is smuggled into Spain,
the biggest point of entry, or Italy, the second.
   The profit incentive is enormous. Drug agents say the cartels
have kept the price artifically high in Europe, $40,000 to $50,000
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) compared to $10,000 to $20,000 in the
United States.
   ``We fear a cocaine wave, not just because of Bush's program but
because the North American cocaine market has been satisfied and
when a market is satisfied then a new market will always be
found,'' said Ketil Bensen, an adviser to Norway's Ministry of
Social Affairs.
   Investigators agree, saying cocaine cartels already had begun to
target Europe before the American crackdown because the U.S. market
was saturated.
   ``They have been moving into Europe very systematically for the
last four or five years,'' said the high-ranking drug agent.
   ``They want to increase the quantity and lower the price to the
point where it is profitable to sell crack. Crack becomes the
cocaine of the poor.''
   Heroin now is the main drug of the European market. From the
poppy fields of the Middle East and southwest Asia, it reaches
Mafia distributors by land through Turkey, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia
or by ship to southern Italy.
   The number of European heroin addicts numbers in the hundreds of
thousands. The number of deaths from heroin overdoses now exceeds
2,000 a year. Italy alone had 809 such deaths last year and West
Germay 670. In the first eight months of this year, Italy had 599
deaths and West Germany 543.
   Miguel Solans, the head of Spain's National Plan for Drugs
agency, said U.S. research indicates cocaine deaths in Europe could
match or surpass those related to heroin use within three years.
   Drug investigators say Gava and Rafael Vera, Spain's secretary
of state for security, have spoken out the loudest about what the
U.S. crackdown could mean in Europe and why the Europeans need to
join coordinated, multinational efforts to combat the trafficking.
   In September, Italy, Spain and the United States agreed to work
together to battle traffickers in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
Officials declined to release the details of the agreement but said
it dealt with training Latin American police, sharing intelligence,
helping to protect threatened judges and providing equipment.
   France and Britain have sent experts to Colombia to assist in
training security forces and in protecting judges and others
threatened with death. Britain also sent a navy frigate to help
patrol Colombia's coast.
   Police in Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, West Germany and
Italy report they are conducting intensified efforts against drug
traffickers at home. Drug-related arrests are also up in Britain,
Belgium, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe of France strengthened anti-drug
forces in September, doubling the number of investigators in the
central drug office, sending specially trained narcotics officers
to cities around the country and hiring financial specialists to
trace money launderers.
   The West German government is considering plans to propose a
special European anti-drug police force from countries of the
12-nation European Economic Community. It is also drafting laws to
give tougher sentences to drug traffickers, accomplices and money
launderers.
   Efforts to deny the drug traffickers their profits by going
after money launderers is considered an essential part of anti-drug
strategies.
   Still, Spain's Solans expressed dismay at the lack of
international progress in stiffening the monitoring of the cash
flows of major banks in the world to try to strangle the money
laundering activities of drug traffickers.
   Some in Europe fear it will become easier for drug traffickers
to operate and launder their money in Western Europe when it
becomes a unified market at the end of 1992.
   Gava acknowledges the problems. But he also notes the steady
rise in drug trafficking of all types.
   ``For narco-traffickers,'' he said, ``it is already a Europe
without frontiers.''

   Here's a school that undoubtedly benefits from
being in New York City. Its curriculum is all about crime and its
students are very aware that the content is lethal. Welcome to the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   By KAY BARTLETT=
AP Newsfeatures Writer=
   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Salamy, a 22-year-old aspiring FBI agent,
was a bit disconcerted when he looked down during an exam and saw a
.38-caliber revolver strapped to the ankle of the student next to
him.
   On this campus, you may smoke only in designated areas. You may
carry your gun anywhere.
   The John Jay College of Criminal Justice, part of the City
University of New York system, is indeed an unusual institution of
higher learning.
   It is a liberal arts college where you cannot major in English,
history or philosophy, but you can major in forensic psychology,
criminology or deviant behavior and social control.
   A science lab is equipped to do DNA testing, the ultimate in
identification. Kojak is now filming in the environs. A vintage
firetruck, enclosed in glass, is the major artwork of one building.
   ``It's the only school where you might have an ex-felon, a
recovering alcoholic, an FBI man and a cop all taking notes in the
same class,'' says Dr. Charles Bahn, a psychology professor.
   ``In fact, we used to joke back when it was nearly all cops,
`How do you grade a class where everybody is armed?' We told them
we gave credit for time served and were open to plea bargaining.''
   John Jay is one of only a few colleges of criminal justice,
including those at the universities of Chicago, Nebraska at Omaha,
Wisconsin, Louisville, Baltimore and East Tennessee State.
   Soon to celebrate its 25th anniversary, John Jay is still called
the ``cop school,'' but it has expanded its horizons since it was
housed in the Police Academy and all the students were New York's
finest.
   In the ensuing years, the college moved to several different
locations in Manhattan, but up until the 1970s about 70 percent of
its students were police officers.
   Now housed in two buildings near Lincoln Center, and just south
of a housing project, the student body is predominantly civilian,
with only a quarter of them cops or others in uniformed services.
   Still, the coffee shop-deli down the street would not make the
day of an armed robber. There is a lot of firepower beyond those
pastrami and corned beef sandwiches.
   There are more than 8,000 students, most of them pursuing
associate and bachelor's degrees. In addition, 550 are working for
their masters and 103 their doctorate.
   John Jay, named after the first U.S. Chief Justice, has a
special mission within the CUNY system, the largest urban
university in the country with 19 schools and 194,000 students.
Says Jay's president, Gerald Lynch:
   ``We hope John Jay will help professionalize the criminal
justice system, teach people in law enforcement that life is
ambiguous, that life is made up of grays, that it will give them
more compassion.
   ``We don't teach fingerprinting here. We have a library, which I
insisted be the first thing people see when they enter the new
building. We have a 625-seat theater.
   ``The students learn things here they will use outside of their
professional life, things to enrich their personal life.''
   Students often complain about the liberal arts courses, since
many have already decided on a career. Salamy, for example, wants
to become either an FBI man or a DEA agent.
   Despite the similarity of interest, there is great diversity.
   ``Students here want to be anything from probation officers to
judges to senators,'' says Julia Bryant, a school spokeswoman.
``There are 19-year-olds who want to be on `21 Jump Street' and
older cops who want to be commissioner.''
   There are also indications that some of the police students are
preparing for a second career. Security management is an
increasingly popular major.
   ``Maybe the biggest thrill of going to John Jay is knowing you
are going to have a job when you get out,'' says Dr. Lawrence
Kobilinsky, who is a recognized DNA-fingerprinting expert.
   Graduates are heavily recruited by would-be employers, including
law enforcement agencies. The Rochester, N.Y., Police Department
set up a recruitment table early this semester.
   The school's alumni include two dozen to three dozen police
chiefs across the country.
   The Criminal Justice Center housed at Jay is sort of an advanced
cop school, but students don't take formal courses. It offers
workshops and seminars on such things as hostage negotiation,
stakeout and surveillance techniques, confidential informants,
clandestine drug labs, bomb awareness. The classroom is often the
street.
   These specials, usually given for law enforcement agencies but
occasionally for private industry, are not open for public
inspection. They don't want to give away secrets of the sleuthing
trade.
   ``The mutts don't know these things,'' said one of the 35 New
York City housing cops who attended a five-day workshop on
narcotics investigation.
   The workshop was conducted by Lt. Frank Bunting, division chief
of a drug enforcement task force that includes federal, state and
city agents.
   Bunting presented the latest technology and offered advice
growing out of his own experience. In discussing surveillance he
talked of ``ghosts'' and ``uncles'' and other undercover operatives.
   The students role-play a drug bust, and sometimes they make
mistakes. In one, the major suspect simply strolls out of the room,
while the ``arresting officers'' question the lesser crooks.

   Once upon a time nobody could tell time. Well,
they sure can now, down to the nanosecond. On the day we return to
standard time, here are some ruminations by one of America's secret
addicts, a time freak.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a time to reap and a time to sow and a
time to set the clocks back. Today. For a growing number of
Americans, it is a time fraught with excitement.
   I am one of that number. I am a time freak. High time I
confessed.
   No telling how many of us there are in America. Addiction isn't
something you go around talking about. One time freak, however, can
spot another. The other day someone asked my friend, Jim Smith,
what time it was. He replied, ``eight-thirty-two-oh-three.'' No
doubt about it. Jim Smith is one of us.
   A time freak would no more say ``about half past eight'' than a
brain surgeon would say ``about three or four centimeters.''
   Time addiction, a compulsion for split-second exactitude, began
its insidious boring into the American psyche during the 1970s. The
specific date is inexcusably imprecise. But the culprit is not.
   It was the infliction upon an unsuspecting populace of the
quartz watch.
   Like most addictive agents, quartz watches come cheap and easy.
In New York, you can buy one on the street.
   Experts will tell you that when it comes to accuracy, the most
bejeweled chronometer ever crafted by a Swiss master can't hold a
candle (once used to tell time, by the way) to a plastic stick-on
quartz watch you can pick up at the supermarket checkout for $2.49.
   Time addicts aside, America seems to have become a nation of
clock addicts as well. There's a difference.
   When I was a boy, my father had a pocket watch and my mother had
a clock in the kitchen. That was it. The time change was
accomplished, as it were, in no time.
   Today, or last night rather, I had the following to reset:
   My watch, her watch, the kitchen wall clock, the stove clock,
the microwave clock, the telephone clock, the radio clock (Five in
the kitchen. Five!). The den wall clock, the VCR clock, the foyer
clock, the two clocks in the living room, the four radio-alarm
clocks upstairs, the travel alarm and, finally, the car.
   Eighteen, then. And if you're a time freak, this can't be done
casually. No indeed. All those clocks must agree precisely and all
must be right.
   So first you must determine the exact time. From the radio? From
the local number in the phone book? Never. Not if you're serious
about this business. If you're truly time-addicted, you go to The
Source.
   You phone 1-900-410-TIME. It's a toll call but money is of no
consequence; time is of the essence. Or you phone 202-653-1800.
Either number will connect you with the nation's Master Clock at
the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. A recording will
give you the exact time, to the second, at the tone.
   But wait. Just to be sure, you must also phone 303-499-7111. You
will reach the National Institute of Time and Technology in
Boulder, Colo., where the tone will tell you Coordinated Universal
Time. Universal!
   And if you're wondering how many time freaks are loose in the
land, out there glancing at their quartz watches, here's one
indication. The observatory averages about 6,000 calls a day on
both its numbers, the NITT in Boulder about 5,000.
   That's nearly 7 million long-distance calls a year, folks, just
to find out what time it is. Could this addiction be nearing an
epidemic?
   ``The numbers keep increasing,'' says Sheila Faulkner, who keeps
track of the observatory calls. ``That's why we added the 900
number. The other line was often busy. The 900 number can handle
8,000 calls simultaneously.''
   Ms. Faulkner also observes that the heaviest calling periods are
Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, the daylight-standard change
days, and New Year's Eve. ``Both our numbers have peaked on New
Year's Eve, 40,000 on one phone and 36,000 on the other.''
   All those New Year's Eve callers probably aren't true time
freaks, though. Like New Year's Eve drinkers, they likely include a
fair number of amateurs.
   If time freaks are a fairly recent breed, their opposites, those
who could not care less about exactitude, have been around for ages.
   The Navajos, for instance, feel it is far more important to live
in harmony with nature's own rhythms. A favorite of tribal
festivals is a prankster dressed in a three-piece suit, waving a
big alarm clock and shouting ``Time to be hungry!''
   ``Confound the man,'' wrote a Roman poet named Plautus in 200
B.C., ``who in this place set up a sundial to cut and hack my days
so wretchedly into small portions.''
   You have to wonder what old Plautus would have thought of David
Allan. Allan can cut and hack a second of time, one tick, into a
billion parts, into nanoseconds.
   He is the head of the time laboratory at Boulder's National
Institute of Time and Technology, formerly the Bureau of Standards.
You might say David Allan is America's Father Time. It is Allan who
decides how long a second is in the first place. His lab sets the
standard.
   Before 1967 time was measured by astronomical instruments. They
were accurate to a millisecond, a thousandth of a second. Since
then the standard has been an atomic second, measured by an
electron spinning around the nucleus of a cesium atom like the
Earth around the sun. It's more complex, but there's no time to go
into it.
   Let's just say that that electron spins around that nucleus in a
regular pattern, a frequency. When it spins 9,192,631,770 times,
that's a second.
   ``It takes a good counter to count it,'' Allan says, ``but we
can do that.''

   The basis of the atomic clock came from the pioneering work of
Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard who just recently was awarded the Nobel
Prize in physics. His discoveries have enabled science to refine
accuracy to a nanosecond, a billionth, a million times more
accurate than before. David Allan's vocabulary also includes
picosecond, a trillionth.
   Apart from causing time freaks to drool, is that degree of
accuracy of any practical use?
   ``Voyager II's encounter with Neptune could not have been
navigated without atomic clocks in various places around the world
coordinated to the nanosecond. Yes, it is necessary,'' says Allan.
   Well, we time addicts get enough of a fix with our simple quartz
watches, set, at the tone, to Coordinated Universal Time.
   Quartz, Allan explains, has a special quality. When you pass an
electric current over a piece of it, it sets up a resonance, like a
plucked guitar string or a tuning fork, except that as long as the
electricity lasts the resonance remains steady, it doesn't die
down. Hence its remarkable accuracy.
   David Allan, incidentally, wears a quartz wristwatch, an obvious
seal of approval. I should note that most freaks disdain digital
watches. We need to SEE each universally coordinated second go by,
tick by tick.
   We feel smug, if a bit foolish, going about with our quartz
watches noticing, for example, that the lovely sidewalk clock in
front of the bank in Closter, N.J., is a bit slow, that the 6
o'clock whistle in Rivervale, N.J., a local convenience, blows a
shade early, that the Newsweek building in New York has a clock,
though a tad fast, and that the Time building has none. No Time
clock. A pity.
   Those of you who have resisted the quartz-accuracy narcotic and
don't go around babbling about picoseconds, take heart. The clock
is striking back.
   Thomas Bartels reports that membership in his organization is
growing apace and so is the demand for old-fashioned watchmakers.
   Bartels is executive director of the National Association of
Watch and Clock Collectors Inc., an organization of 34,000 members
nationwide. Its museum in Columbia, Pa., is the repository of more
than 9,000 artifacts, none of them digital, none of them quartz.
   ``Old mechanical watches have become extremely popular in the
last couple of years,'' says Bartels. ``There's a whole new
generation of collectors.''
   He believes this horological renaissance is a reaction to the
clinical view of timekeeping by people such as me, overlooking the
beauty and artistry of watchmaking, the poetry of craftsmanship.
   ``I see it all around the country,'' he says, ``young people
interested in mechanical watches, and, as a result, a great demand
put on our remaining watchmakers who were a vanishing breed. Our
watchmaking clinics are busier than ever.''
   Bartels keeps 400 to 500 of the museum clocks running at all
times. ``People like to hear the ticks and the chimes.'' So imagine
his time-change chore.
   ``It's something we dread twice a year. It takes the whole staff
all day to reset them.''
   Tom Bartels, not incidentally, carries a mechanical pocket
watch. He is having the time of his life.

   She came out of grief for her lost husband,
soothed by music, and now she has returned the favor. On Friday her
Philharmonic Center for the Arts opens and she and her community
are the richer.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In her new career as a fund-raiser for the arts,
Myra Daniels tried to sell bricks for the new Philharmonic Center
for the Arts in Naples, Fla., for $100 apiece.
   ``We bought saturation TV ads; that's the way we were taught to
sell soap,'' says the former advertising executive. So she got
before camera and said, ``A wonderful thing is happening in this
community and we want you to be a part of it.''
   The bricks were not a hit, but a little boy recognized her in a
grocery store and asked how much a brick cost. ``I asked how much
he had. $1.29. I took $1.19 without any shame. That kid is a part
of the building.
   ``The arts need advertising. You've got a product here and you
have to sell it,'' Myra Daniels says firmly.
   She adds: ``I believe more top business people should be CEOs of
arts organizations. You can run the arts as a business. You can
remain in the black. You can do anything if you have the funds to
do it and the knowledge to move it.''
   The fact that the $19.4 million Philharmonic Center for the Arts
will open in Naples, Fla., on Friday, debt-free, is a tribute to
Mrs. Daniels acting on her belief and her 33 years of advertising
experience.
   She put an ad in the local newspaper with a coupon to cut out
and mail in a check of a minimum donation of $1,000. The publisher
phoned and said she should save her $1,700 for the ad; people with
$1,000 to donate don't clip coupons out of newspapers. She said she
wanted it to run.
   Five hundred and eight coupons and $2.2 million came in. They
wouldn't buy $100 bricks, but they'd clip coupons for 10 times that
much. It says something about the economic level of Naples, Fla.,
residents.
   ``There are more blue chip corporation CEOs retired in our area
than anywhere else,'' Mrs. Daniels says. However, some of them have
informed her that they've also retired from supporting arts
organizations.
   The center, on 6{ acres, contains 1,221-seat Frances Pew Hayes
Hall, 300-seat Myra Daniels Pavilion, four museum galleries and an
outdoor sculpture garden. The board wanted to name it all for Mrs.
Daniels. She, as board president, vetoed it.
   The center will present 200 events in the first season. Tickets
are sold singly or in subscription groups such as for three
evenings by the Miami City Ballet, four orchestral concerts or five
jazz programs.
   Mrs. Daniels added a line on the order form: ``I want
everything, $1,695.'' Two hundred people marked that.
   ``We know our break-even point is 70 percent of the hall filled.
We know we'll do better than that.''
   It all started with something even smaller than a dream to build
a performing arts center in an area of Florida that didn't have
one. It started with grief and a reaching out for the soothing,
healing properties of music.
   The year, 1965, that Myra Janco of Chicago was named ad woman of
the year by the Advertising Federation of America, she met Draper
Daniels when he came to her office to buy her advertising agency.
He, chairman of the board of his agency, named her president. They
married in 1967. ``He was an advertising genius,'' she says. ``He
fathered the Marlboro Man, the Jolly Green Giant in the Valley and
`Sorry, Charlie,' for Starkist Tuna.''
   In 1978, they retired to Marco Island, Fla. Daniels died in
1983, after a four-year illness. His widow took personal inventory.
She knew, after concentrating so long on nursing and then grieving,
that she needed to rejoin the world. ``I'm not very good on a
tennis court any more. I never was good on a golf course. I thought
about going back to Chicago.
   ``I went to a concert by 12 people, in a church in Naples.
There's a sound of live music that mesmerizes you.''
   She invited a friend, state Rep. Mary Ellen Hawkins, to go with
her. ``She said, `I hate amateur music.' I said: `Not as much as I
do. We'll sit by the door. If it's bad, we'll sneak out.'
   ``The man running it spoke to Mary Ellen at intermission and
said they owed money. She said, `Myra will help you.'''
   Mrs. Daniels was not pleased then but says now, ``She pushed me
and gave me the greatest gift.''
   That's how this 63-year-old with a marketing Ph.D. from Indiana
University got back in action. Reluctantly. She invited the
concert-givers to her home the next morning, to give them advice
and send them away. She remembers:
   ``I didn't want to get mixed up with a volunteer group but you
have to help your community. I told them, `You can't play again
unless you have $100,000 in the bank.' They were going concert by
concert.
   ``I said they needed a telephone campaign. They didn't know how.
I said I'd test it for a week, thinking I'd get them out of my
hair. You put a red dot by every so many names in the phone book,
which gives you a random statistical response for the community. I
decided I wouldn't call anyone I knew. They'd be nice to the poor
little widow.''
   One person she called was Frances Pew Hayes from Philadelphia
who said she had already gone through her donation budget, but
``I'll give you twenty-five.'' When the check came it was for
$25,000. Mrs. Daniels says: ``Within a week, I got $100,000. They
thought I could walk on water. They wouldn't let me go.''
   So, Mrs. Daniels, who had had childhood piano lessons and loved
music, thought the next step should be an orchestra instead of 10
amateur and two professional players. ``I started buying musicians.
I worked on the idea that you find fine principal players and let
them build up their sections. We went to 38.''

   She invited Mrs. Hayes, whose acquaintance she had made by that
time made, to the first concert, in a high school. ``She said,
`You'll never get any better unless you have a hall of your own.' I
thought, `Is the woman crazy?' She said, `I'll buy the land so
you'll have it when you're ready to build.'
   ``The next morning I put on boots and went to the boondocks,
looking at land. Then, I thought, `Why don't I put her money in
escrow and look for land that could be donated to us.' Westinghouse
Communities of Naples gave us the majority of the land.''
   Then came fund raising for a hall for the symphony _ stabilized
at 70 members _ which became two halls under one roof. ``I don't
feel I'm asking anyone for money. I'm giving them the chance to
build the future civilization of this part of the country and an
opportunity to make their lives better.
   ``I gained 40 pounds. We would bring people to suppers and tell
our story. I have been to more Rotary and Optimist clubs. I go
anyplace people want to hear about this. I say: `Ladies and
gentlemen, it's a matter of money. If you want Itzhak Perlman to
play here...''' The acclaimed violinist is booked for a recital
Feb. 5.
   ``I was a brunette when I started this project. Maybe I'll be a
brunette again if I ever get time to go to the beauty parlor,''
Mrs. Daniels says, touching her gray hair.
   ``I never sit at intermissions. I'm up and many times I'm
collecting funds. I met Curtiss E. Frank, who was vice chairman of
Dun and Bradstreet, at an intermission. He has given $2.28 million.
The foyer will be named for him.''
   Mrs. Daniels wrote a proposal that brought in $3.5 million from
the state, got donations of concrete, windows and marble from near
Naples, Italy. Hugh De Pree, then president of furniture-maker
Herman Miller Inc., told her she could go to his Michigan company
and choose concert chairs and office furniture. He didn't know her
well, she says. She chose the best.
   A retired conductor who intended to give his library to a
university saw the center being built and donated it there. One man
is giving his collection of vintage movies.
   Mrs. Daniels moved from Marco Island to Naples so she could walk
to work and says: ``I don't feel any less juices than I did when I
was a 24-year-old kid going out to conquer the world in
advertising. I'm happy, I guess because I'm in control of what I
can do. You can be a sweet little old lady widow having everyone
feel sorry for you and invite you to dinner parties once in a while
or you can do something for the place you're in.
   ``Dan was a great one to share a great deal of himself; I used
to think we should have more private time. When he was dying and in
and out of a coma, one day he said, `Myra, don't ever forget, every
private person has a public responsibility,' and he went off again.
   ``Damn you, Dan, I've done it now.''

   Oscar Carlson, a 79-year-old dairy farmer,
thought he'd sooner die than go to prison for the mercy killing of
his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. But after serving
half his sentence, Carlson is delighted with his new life at
Stillwater Prison, where officials describe him as a refreshing
prison oddity who adores his job tending a vegetable garden.

   On the eve of his imprisonment for the
mercy killing of his diseased and bedridden wife, Oscar Whelem
Carlson begged God to strike him dead.
   ``I was so afraid that I prayed that night that I could have a
heart attack and die,'' Carlson said. ``I was at my lowest.''
   The 79-year-old retired dairy farmer and former bus driver said
he was petrified at the thought of living in a maximum security
penitentiary with rapists, thieves, drug dealers and psycho killers.
   He was at peace with his earlier decision to pump four bullets
into his wife of 47 years, Agnes. But he had hoped for a more
lenient sentence than 3{ years at Minnesota's Stillwater Prison.
   About halfway into his stay, Carlson is delighted with the place.
   If he could draw an occasional furlough to visit his wife's
grave in Evansville, he says he wouldn't mind making it his
permanent home.
   ``I'd much sooner stay here than in an old folks' home,'' said
the bespectacled Carlson, who shares laughs and meals with
convicted felons one-fourth his age. ``Agnes was in that nursing
home and she didn't like it there one day.''
   On Feb. 29, 1988, Carlson sneaked an old revolver into the
nursing home room where Agnes, 71, lay suffering from Alzheimer's
disease and a broken hip. He spoke with her briefly, then pulled
the trigger repeatedly. At his trial two months later, Carlson
pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.
   Carlson said many of his fellow inmates aren't aware of his
past. But when they ask questions, he doesn't hesitate to answer.
   ``I talk to them like I was one of the boys and they treat me
that way,'' Carlson said.
   Prison caseworker Glenn Hall said Carlson is a refreshing prison
oddity: a secure, gentle man who adores his job as caretaker of a
prison garden brimming with melons, tomatoes, corn and other crops.
   ``They all kind of treat him like a grandpa,'' Hall said. ``Even
I do in a way.''
   Carlson spent his first 11 months in the ``big house'' before
getting a bed March 20 in a minimum security building just outside
the prison walls. With credit for good behavior, he could be
released next September.
   Carlson said he didn't seek the transfer and actually missed the
maximum security unit for its assortment of religious services. He
grew up Lutheran, but participated in spiritual gatherings of all
sorts and had befriended a Roman Catholic priest.
   Marcene Cole of Fergus Falls, Carlson's oldest daughter, said
she was surprised at the speed of her father's adjustment.
   ``I think he was awfully scared at first,'' Cole said. ``But he
made the best of it. He seems to look at things positively.''
   Bill Schroeder, Carlson's longtime friend, said prison may have
been a blessing in disguise because many people in the Evansville
area would have shunned Carlson had he been ordered instead to do
community service.
   Carlson said Marcene and his youngest daughter, Millie,
supported his decision. But he said his other daughter, Mary Beth,
was angered that her mother's life _ albeit miserable at times _
was cut short. She declined to discuss the ordeal.
   ``I wasn't too happy at first,'' said Schroeder. ``I was really
shocked and really angry with him. It took me quite a while to get
myself together on this to realize that Oscar was at his breaking
point. Everybody has a breaking point.''
   For Carlson the breaking point arrived when he received word
from a hospital in Alexandria that Agnes would have to undergo hip
surgery.
   ``That's when my mind slipped and I got my gun,'' Carlson said.
   Carlson retrieved the weapon from his woodshed, drove to the
nursing home and prayed before asking his wife if she wanted to
have the surgery done.
   When she declined, Carlson said he asked her if she wanted a
``shot'' _ a term she understood from his days as a butcher when he
used the revolver to kill pigs and cattle.
   ``She looked right at me and she said, `Yes.''' Carlson said.
``I shot her twice in the heart. She knew I was pretty handy with
the gun.''
   Seeing her mouth open and fearing doctors would rush in and
attempt to revive her, Carlson said he shot her again _ once in the
eye and once in the mouth. Before sheriff's deputies arrived about
20 minutes later, Carlson said, he wept and prayed over his wife's
body.
   Asked by Douglas County District Judge Paul Ballard why he
killed her, Carlson said, ``Because she was suffering and I
couldn't stand to see her suffer any longer.''
   He said his only regret about Agnes was placing her in the
nursing home in the first place. But Alzheimer's had warped her
mind, he said, and he was weary from providing 24-hour care.
   Although the Carlsons' rural Evansville house had indoor
plumbing, Agnes began insisting on using the outhouse and Carlson
said he had to accompany her to prevent her from wandering away.
She had long since started to believe that Carlson was her father
and she often didn't recognize her children, Carlson said. In
addition, the vegetable garden that had been the centerpiece of
their lives had gone to weeds.
   Inside the nursing home, Carlson said, Agnes took a turn for the
worse. She had been there about 10 months before he killed her.
   ``I wouldn't care to stay in that place any more than she did,''
Carlson said. ``They called it murder what I did. But she very much
agreed on it so I think I helped her out of a lot of mess.''
   While Carlson enjoyed maximum security, he said minimum security
provides for group outings that allows him to bowl, attend Sunday
religious services in Stillwater and shop.
   Better yet, the spry Carlson can tend to the prison's half-acre
garden, situated near the prison golf course. Carlson said he works
from 7:30 a.m. until 11, breaks for a 90-minute lunch, and ends his
day in the garden at 3 p.m.
   ``We got bankers' hours,'' he said.
   Despite being well-liked, Carlson said he hasn't made any close
friends in minimum security because ``they come and go too soon.''
   But he said three strangers have written to him to offer their
companionship upon his release. The most serious offer came from a
73-year-old Florida woman who read about his plight and offered to
care for him ``the rest of my days,'' Carlson said.
   ``It's a possibility,'' he said. ``But like they tell me, I've
got a long time to make up my mind. I'm in no hurry to leave.''

   Only 10 J-class sloops were ever built, and
today, only three remain. The Endeavor, which challenged for the
America's Cup in 1934, is one of them, thanks to a lifelong
yachtswoman who rescued the wrecked yacht from its berth in England
and rebuilt it to the tune of $10 million.

   Friends told her the legendary boat would
sail again when pigs flew. Still, Elizabeth Meyer was determined to
breathe new life into the 50-year-old Endeavor, one of the three
remaining J-class sailboats.
   Five years and $10 million later, Endeavor is racing again.
   ``J-boats are to sailors what Mount Everest is to climbers,''
says Meyer, 36, a lifelong yachtswoman who spent more than 20 years
following the J-class yachts. ``I've always been in love with their
history.''
   Only 10 J-class sloops were ever built, the last in 1937. The
Endeavor, which had eight owners in its 55 years, and two others
are left.
   When the 130-foot boat that challenged for the America's Cup in
1934 came up for sale, it was berthed at Calshot Spit, England,
wrecked, out of the water it once ruled so gracefully.
   ``When I saw Endeavor, I said ... `Somebody has to do
something,''' Meyer says. She decided in ``a thunderclap'' that she
was the one to undertake the challenge.
   ``I didn't hesitate and I haven't regretted it,'' she says.
   Meyer, the granddaughter of financier Eugene Meyer Jr., a former
owner of The Washington Post, could certainly afford the whim.
   ``In order to do something like that properly it takes a lot
more than money. It takes a lot of attention to detail. That's what
I gave it, and that's what the people I hired gave it,'' she says.
   Meyer has ``the sense of quality to not just get things right,
but make them perfect,'' says Gary Jobson, a member of the team
that defended the 1977 America's Cup and recently skippered the
Endeavor off Newport. ``This boat is nicer now than it ever was.''
   Meyer would not disclose the ``negligible'' sum she paid for the
boat. Its former owners paid approximately $16 for it in 1979, when
it no longer floated.
   Among those who helped Meyer rebuild Endeavor was Frank Murdock,
one of the boat's original designers and crew.
   Meyer also met with Sir Thomas Sopwith, for whom the Endeavor
was built in 1934. Although he was interested in her undertaking,
Sopwith, who died in January, told her that ``the boat was
ridiculous then and they're worse now,'' according to Meyer.
   He told her it was a monstrosity, wild and dangerous. Meyer,
however, says that when she sailed the Endeavor, she found the boat
to have ``very good manners.''
   ``I was not prepared for how good she was,'' says Meyer. ``She
was quick and responsive. It's just so much fun to sail that boat.''
   The monstrosity boasts a solid cherry interior and carved marble
fireplace.
   ``It's the J-boat aesthetics as seen by Elizabeth Meyer,'' she
says. ``Beauty took precedence over safety, good sense,
practicality. Because the prime function of a J-boat is to be
beautiful _ and sail wicked good.''
   Jobson calls the Endeavor the finest yacht in the world.
   ``Donald Trump's (yacht) is a statement in glitz. It's
expensive. It's big. (The Endeavor) is a statement of excellence,''
he says.
   Meyer moved to England for 18 months while the ship was rebuilt,
and oversaw the reconstruction of the hull. The weather was
miserable and it was often difficult to get supplies for work on
the boat.
   ``It was hard a lot of the time, but I never wanted to sell the
boat, get rid of it or walk away from it,'' Meyer says.
   Meyer says it was necessary, for the sake of the boat, that she
be the sole voice in its rebuilding.
   ``A group can't do a boat like this. It's got to have one owner
who calls the shots and pays the money. You have to assume you know
what's right. The minute you start to wonder, you fall apart'' _
but while stern and decisive on the outside, Meyer says there were
many nights when she cried herself to sleep.
   Things are easier now on the Endeavor.
   ``You go below off-watch to the air conditioning _ take a hot
bath, watch the VCR,'' Meyer says.
   But even in the luxury below are reminders of the trying times.
   In the boat's salon, above the 10-place dining room table, hangs
a friend's painting of a flying pig, embellished with the caption,
``Endeavor? When pigs fly.''

   Mario Lanza died 30 years ago, but his legacy is
still going strong. It lives on in fan clubs that are still active,
records that still sell, and a neighborhood that still fondly
remembers the man known as ``the new Caruso.''

   Thirty years have passed since the death of
Mario Lanza, the curly haired movie star with the booming tenor
voice that earned him the nickname ``the new Caruso.''
   But memories of Lanza live on _ in his fan clubs, in his
records, which still sell briskly, and especially, in his old
neighborhood, the Little Italy section of South Philadelphia, where
opera once was as popular as baseball in Brooklyn.
   Lanza was just 38 when he died of a heart attack, on Oct. 7,
1959, 10 years after the opening of the first of his seven movies.
   ``But you see, it didn't really end there,'' says Nicholas
Petrella, who owned a corner record store in Lanza's old
neighborhood. He did $38 a day in business until Lanza came home a
star. That day, Petrella did over $4,000.
   Today, he is president of the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum,
on the third floor of the Settlement Music School where Lanza
studied violin and piano as a boy. ``The voice that he had, and his
spirit, still live today, right here, in Philadelphia, all over the
world,'' Petrella says.
   The only son of immigrant parents, Lanza was born Alfredo Arnold
Cocozza in 1921, the same year opera lovers mourned Caruso's
passing. A member of his old neighborhood gang recalled ``Freddie''
Cocozza as ``loud and raucous,'' a superb athlete who loved the
summer beaches of Wildwood, N.J.
   Lanza grew up listening to the family collection of Caruso
records. His voice began to develop and one day he sang along with
the great tenor's recording of ``Vesti la Giubba.''
   ``To my utter amazement, I found I could reach the high notes
with comparative ease. I was overjoyed. My heart was bursting,''
Lanza said years later.
   His mother had wanted to be an opera singer, a career denied
proper young ladies. So Maria Lanza married instead.
   According to her sisters, Julia Alioto and Hilda Lanza, it was
she who encouraged her son to choose Hollywood over the opera. He
thanked her by adopting her maiden name and the masculine form of
her first name.
   The singer had little formal training. Enrico Rosatti, a
well-known teacher of the old school, once told Lanza: ``No one can
teach you to sing, my boy. You had the greatest teacher of all _
God.''
   At his grandfather's summer home in Wildwood, however, he took
lessons from a blind man named Paul Bosco, godfather to the Lanza
brood.
   Years later, Hollywood hype held that Lanza had been a truck
driver and piano mover prior to his movie career. ``He never worked
like that a day in his life,'' said his uncle, Arnold Lanza. But he
did pose as a piano mover to get into the Philadelphia Academy of
Music for an impromptu audition. The ruse worked; conductor Serge
Koussevitsky took him to the Berkshire Music Festival.
   World War II made him a private in the Army Air Corps in Texas.
A bad eye kept him away from combat. He discovered Special Services
and decided to try for the ``Winged Victory'' show. His throat was
sore the day of the audition so he ripped the label from a Caruso
record and submitted it as his own.
   Also in the show was actor Bert Hicks, who introduced Lanza to
his sister, Betty. They later married and had four children.
   Discharged, back in New York, the singer met RCA vice president
Jim Murray, and signed a record contract with the same company that
had recorded Caruso. Lanza also later hired Caruso's old agent.
Ultimately, he decided he could reach many more through films than
from the stage, and he performed only one opera, ``Madame
Butterfly,'' with the Grand Opera in New Orleans.
   In Hollywood, Terry Robinson was given the job of helping Lanza
trim pounds for the camera. He also became a close friend; when
Lanza's wife died in March 1960, Robinson and his late friend's
parents raised their four children.
   ``There are so many things to remember,'' Robinson said. ``The
nights when Mario would take one of the girls and I would take the
other. Then we would go up the stairs to their bedrooms as he sang
to them. The nights he was out and the maid would play one of his
records so they would sleep. A $50 tip to a waitress and picking up
the lunch checks of those who recognized him.''
   In 1950, Lanza filmed ``The Toast of New Orleans'' followed in
1951 by the box office smash ``The Great Caruso,'' Lanza's
favorite. He threw himself into the role, even gaining weight to
match the accounts of Caruso's growing bulk.
   ``For me, the film ... was an unbelievable dream come true,'' he
said.
   Two more movies followed, ``Because You're Mine'' and
``Serenade.'' He then got into a fight with MGM over ``The Student
Prince'' and was replaced. The movie was a flop, although the
soundtrack featuring Lanza was an album smash. But concerts were
canceled due to health and other problems, his managers allowed him
to sink into debt and friends turned away from him.
   He and his family fled to Italy in 1957, where he made two more
movies, ``The Hills of Rome'' and ``For the First Time.'' Concert
tours sold out as quickly as they were announced.
   At the time of his death, Lanza's comeback was well under way.
His body lay in state in Philadelphia, and thousands filed past,
holding the funeral home open until 3 a.m. Antionette Marzano, 71,
an old family friend, collapsed and died after passing the casket.
   Lanza was buried in Los Angeles, near the tomb of comic Lou
Costello.
   Today, 30 years later, Lanza's legacy includes scholarships for
young singers, financed by an annual ball held each November.
   His records also survive, and RCA continues to sell them,
updating them now into compact disks. They yield about $100,000 a
year in royalties.
   Mario Lanza fan clubs are still active in Orlando, Fla.;
Banbury, England; Pflugersstr, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Dublin,
Ireland; and New Zealand.
   None of the Lanza children followed him into show business. But
two of today's best-known tenors, Luciano Pavarotti and Placido
Domingo, both claim Lanza as an inspiration. And two scholarship
winners are now regular performers of opera, Petrella says.
   ``If there's one wish I could have, it's that I want him always
to be heard and to be appreciated,'' said Lanza's daughter, Lisa
Bergman of Los Angeles. ``I just feel he should go on and on.''

   James Earl Jones, who plays a pool hall owner in
``Third and Oak: the Pool Hall,'' has a pool table in his suburban
home. He piles books on it. But in case his 6-year-old son ever
wants to learn to play, it's there.
   ``Third and Oak: the Pool Hall,'' a three-character play by
Marsha Norman, will be shown on the A&amp;E cable network on Thursday
at 9 p.m. EST, and again on Sunday, Nov. 5. It's the first of four
one-hour plays by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights to be shown on
A&amp;E on the first Thursday of four months as ``American Playwrights
Theater,'' a GM Mark of Excellence presentation.
   At first, Jones wasn't sure he wanted to play the character, he
says, since he likes to portray people who, whether or not they're
poor, are worthwhile. ``That was the problem here. I had to accept
he was a jerk. I'm playing not a villain but not a right guy. I had
to readjust my thinking.
   ``He is one of the blind ones. I defined Troy Maxson in `Fences'
(Jones played Maxson on Broadway) as a man who didn't distinguish
his principles from his prejudices. This is such a man. He seemed
gratuitously racialist if not racist when it came to references to
people outside his race, particularly to the girl who visits the
pool hall. She is blond. She qualifies, in his eyes, for derision.
   ``I had a problem with that. I don't like to promote gratuitous
racialism at all.
   ``I had to understand that white people had never meant anything
good to him. He can't understand how, on a romantic level, they can
mean something good to the man he thinks of essentially as his son.
He can't see shared genuine affection and love between people who
come from different worlds. He can't see she is as desperate as the
young man is and their desperation is very similar. They resolve it
without having a messy affair, as my character had been afraid.
   ``My character, who's in a closed society, behaves as if he's a
Mafia don. He expects obedience and the mantle to be passed.''
   Mario Van Peebles, star of the TV series ``Sonny Spoon,'' and
Debra Cole act with Jones.
   Marsha Norman won the Pulitzer Prize in 1983 for ``'night
Mother.'' The other playwrights in the series are Eugene O'Neill,
Paul Zindel and Tennessee Williams.
   ``Having been around a long time doesn't mean good scripts are
going to come flowing your way in excess,'' Jones says. ``There are
more good actors than good works.''
   But Jones stays busy. He was a poet in the film ``Field of
Dreams''; played civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in the first
``Saturday Night with Connie Chung'' docudrama on NBC-TV; and
recently narrated ``Ivory Wars,'' about African elephants, on the
Discovery Channel.
   He has made several movies, not yet released, since ``Field of
Dreams.'' ``I have a 6-year-old. I have to keep working. I don't
make multimillions per movie. I don't think anybody should, frankly.
   ``I like the young crowd of actors coming up. The young man who
played my son in `Fences,' Courtney Vance, is in `Hamburger Hill.'
It's on cable this week. I've seen it five times, to see his
scenes. He's a phenomenal actor. He ranks with young actors like
Eric Roberts, Terence Booth, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Costner. They're
strong without being macho bulls. They're strong as people.''
   Next, Jones goes to Louisiana to play the man who runs the
company store in the movie ``Convicts.'' The wardrobe mistress told
him to bring clothes he wore in ``Matewan,'' which was about coal
miners in the 1920s.
   Some moviegoers recognized his voice as Darth Vader in ``Star
Wars,'' though the credits listed the actor inside the costume and
helmet. Using his voice was an afterthought, after the movie was
shot, Jones says. ``I didn't feel it was proper for me to take
credit. I had been a member of the board of directors of the
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences when Mercedes
McCambridge's voice was in Linda Blair's body in `The Exorcist.'
   ``I didn't want to get involved with that sort of thing again. I
denied it during the whole exposure of the first episode. I took
credit in the third (`Return of the Jedi') because I was going to
be bumped off.''
   When a criticism that black voices shouldn't be used for
villains is quoted, Jones explosively utters a barnyard word.
``That's a racialist point of view, as destructive, limiting and
negative as racism is. I heard a lot of it. That's when black
people who need a platform can't find anything better to talk
about. That's embarrassing. There are a lot of really important
issues and they had to light on that to talk about.''
   Jones, whose training was on stage, mostly acts in movies and TV
now. ``The energy factor gets more and more difficult. I'm not
happy unless I have a role that's totally engaging. I commit for
more than six months and I get burned out. If I did a small part
I'd be happier but I wouldn't be able to make a living from it.
   ``So I will do less stage work, only special things and probably
short engagements. I think my days of commercial theater are
probably coming to an end. I'll go to pasture in movies and TV.''
   But he won't retire, Jones says. ``When we stop doing, we stop
being. Most actors can keep functioning till they can't walk any
more. Spencer Tracy couldn't hear but kept functioning.''
   He says with a laugh that he's considering modifying his rich,
deep voice for TV commercials. ``I just finished doing the voice of
a car. They wanted a kind of Darth Vader voice. I did enjoy doing
those commercials. I will have to look for another road to do
commercials. Maybe some squeaky voice. I don't know.''

   Right now, the days and nights of television's
Molly Dodd _ also known as actress Blair Brown _ are spent on a
shabby block of West 47th Street, at Broadway's Ethel Barrymore
Theatre.
   She's starring in ``The Secret Rapture,'' a new play by British
playwright David Hare, her boyfriend. The drama was written
specifically for Brown _ ``For Blair, as ever,'' says Hare's
dedication _ and she plays one of its three choice female roles.
   It tells of two sisters (Brown and Frances Conroy) who return
home after the death of their father and who must deal with their
lives as well as the life of their alcoholic stepmother (Mary Beth
Hurt). Marion, played by Conroy, is an ambitious junior minister in
the Thatcher government, and Isobel, the role played by Brown, is
an ineffectual but well-intentioned graphic designer.
   ``The Secret Rapture'' was a big hit at England's National
Theatre where it was performed by a different cast and with a
different director. Hare does the honors here.
   ``What's hard for some people about David's plays is that they
are not manuals about how to live,'' Brown says. ``Everyone in
them, not unlike life, is a mixture of good and bad, strengths and
weaknesses. And that's sometimes difficult for mass American
audiences to accept.''
   She's confident that New York theatergoers won't have trouble
relating to very English characters and will have an easier time
picking up on the family drama than the British politics.
   ``So many of the characters sound very American, like Marion,
who is a real achiever, or her husband Tom, a Christian
businessman,'' Brown says. ``I thought the United States had the
corner on that profession and that they were all Southern.''
   Whether ``The Secret Rapture'' will succeed on Broadway, Brown
doesn't know, but she has an affection for the character she plays.
   ``Isobel is a woman sensitive to a certain kind of emotional
blackmail, probably a person who's living her life according to the
path of least resistance,'' the actress says. ``She is not a
victim. She hangs on to her own integrity but, to a fault, Isobel
is a good daughter.''
   Not unlike the slightly bewildered woman Brown plays on the
television series ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' now seen
on Lifetime, a cable channel.
   ``Molly Dodd's'' history is worthy of soap opera, if not sitcom.
   It began more than two years ago with producer Jay Tarses, for
whom Brown had done a television pilot that ABC decided not to pick
up. They had gotten along immediately.
   ``We had the same sense of humor _ he was so twisted,'' Brown
laughs.
   ``Then Brandon Tarikoff of NBC called Jay and, without ever
mentioning the `Mary' word, said he wanted to do a series about a
single woman in the big city,'' she recalls.
   What Tarses came up with was ``Molly Dodd,'' which premiered on
NBC during the summer of 1987. Despite cheers from the critics, it
never lived up to the network's expectations. What NBC got was an
unusual comedy in which Molly struggled to cope with her mother,
ex-husband, sister, various boyfriends and life. Some of the time,
she didn't succeed.
   The show, moved from time slot to time slot, eventually was cast
off by NBC and picked up by Lifetime. And instead of being filmed
in Los Angeles, ``Molly Dodd'' is now done in New York, where its
production team can take advantage of the city's theater people.
   ``The pool of actors here is much grittier, much more
interesting,'' Brown says. ``Now we have a little theatrical rep
company.''
   Most of the show's scripts are written by playwright Eric
Overmyer, author of ``On the Verge,'' and directed by Don Scardino,
a veteran theater performer who will direct the play ``A Few Good
Men'' on Broadway later this season.
   Everyone took a salary cut when the show moved to cable because
the licensing fees are less.
   ``But it was worth it,'' Brown says. ``What's your choice? Not
to do it because you are going to make more money doing something
you don't like?''
   The size of the audience on cable is smaller, too _ ``We were
worried viewers wouldn't be able to find us'' _ but people still
recognize Brown on the street.
   ``It's nice, but then Molly is kind of a benevolent personality.
It's not like Judy Carne's `sock-it-to-me' girl on `Laugh In.' They
don't want to see how tough I am. They basically think I'm their
neighbor.''
   And most don't think of her as a theater actress. Audiences
don't realize that before there was ``The Days and Nights of Molly
Dodd'' or movies like ``Continental Divide'' with John Belushi or
TV miniseries like ``Kennedy'' and ``Captains and the Kings,''
there was the stage.
   Brown, a native of Washington, D.C., has extensive and
impressive credits, starting with her training at the National
Theatre of Canada. She ended up working at the Shakespeare Festival
in Stratford, Ontario, and in regional theaters across Canada and
the United States, including two seasons at the Guthrie in
Minneapolis.
   ``I was an ingenue, so I could always get work because I looked
the right way,'' she says.
   ``A couple years ago I was going in for an audition and I could
see this director thinking, `Oh, this is a television actress, I'm
going to cross over,''' she says. ``I wanted to take him by the
throat and yell, `Look at my credits.'''
   Brown was given six months off from ``Molly Dodd'' to do ``The
Secret Rapture.'' If it runs long enough, she'll leave the play
next February to resume production of the television series.
   ``It's very rare to have this much good material to do _
especially material that is written for you,'' Brown says. ``So
it's just bad sportsmanship to complain. Just keep your mouth shut
and count your lucky stars because it will soon be over.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Running Well-Organized for Presidential Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Knocking on doors in the early
evening, just before people settle down to watch soap operas
imported from Brazil, the polite campaign workers ask citizens how
they are going to vote in Nicaragua's presidential election.
   Then they make a smooth pitch for the FSLN _ the Sandinista
National Liberation Front, which has run the country since 1979.
   At a news conference on a sunny morning at the foreign
correspondents' club, President Daniel Ortega answers questions
with quotable, well-rehearsed phrases in his quest for re-election.
   Afterwards, everyone is handed a yellow T-shirt with ``Daniel
Presidente'' on the front and ``Vota Por FSLN'' (Vote For the FSLN)
in back. Pinned to each shirt is the name of the recipient, neatly
written in ink on a square of paper.
   If Nicaragua's presidential election Feb. 25 hinges on
organization, party discipline and attention to detail, the
Sandinistas have a decided edge at this stage of the campaign.
   Their main challenger, a coalition called the National
Opposition Union, has been relying on rallies, campaign appearances
and the newspaper La Prensa, published by its presidential
candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamarro.
   ``Nobody's going to vote for Dona Violeta because of a
T-shirt,'' said Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and
campaign manager.
   In contrast to the Sandinistas, the opposition is fractured into
20 parties, 12 of them supporting Mrs. Chamorro. The Sandinistas
have more and better television ads, a neighborhood organization
that knows the registration status of every household and the power
and patronage of a governing party.
   The Sandinistas have painted walls with red and black signs
reading ``Daniel'' or ``FSLN.''
   The opposition's most pervasive slogans are white painted
graffiti that read ``UNO equals Democracy.'' UNO are the Spanish
initials of the opposition coalition.
   ``Our resources don't allow us great projects,'' said Lacayo,
who is taking six months off from running a company that produces
cooking oil.
   Lacayo denies Sandinista accusations that $5 million has entered
Nicaragua secretly to finance the opposition. He said UNO has
received only meager donations from exiled Nicaraguans, along with
a few loudspeakers, three tape-recorders, batteries and an
electricity generator.
   But he said he isn't worried.
   ``UNO's most important tasks now are to make sure the voter
registration stations are well watched ... and to make people lose
their fear,'' he said.
   Fear indeed is evident.
   ``We'd better not talk about that. Why look for problems?'' said
a 72-year-old woman when asked what she thought of the opposition.
Like other potential voters, she talked to a reporter only on
condition that her name not be used.
   Four Sundays in October were set aside for voter registration.
Reporters who surveyed registration posts found UNO and other
opposition party representatives at about half of them; the
Sandinistas were represented at all of those surveyed. An estimated
1.9 million people are eligible to register.
   ``We have 40,000 militants (workers),'' said the Sandinista
campaign manager, Bayardo Arce. ``We don't think the problem here
is money. What is important is the work we do house by house.''
   In a country where no single radio or TV station reaches the
whole country, and where most people can't read, don't have access
to or just plain can't afford a newspaper, the surest way to reach
each voter is face-to-face.
   With 40,000 workers, the Sandinistas have one worker for every
40 voters expected to register. Lacayo says UNO has 16,000
sympathizers nationwide who help with rallies and encourage people
to vote for UNO.
   In one lower-class Managua neighborhood, a housewife and mother
of two said Sandinista campaign workers had come three times to her
house. She has seen no sign of the opposition.
   ``The first time they asked us to register,'' said the woman.
``Then they came again and said `You're going to vote for the
Sandinista Front, right?'
   ``I said sure. I'm not going to argue with these people. But I
told them everything is too expensive and the government is
responsible. They said it was the fault of Yankee aggression.''
   That doesn't mean she will vote for Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``That woman doesn't know anything about anything,'' the woman
said.
   The 72-year-old woman said Sandinista workers came by her house
in August.
   ``I told them I needed reading glasses because I don't have
money to buy them,'' she said. ``They wrote my name down and said
they would get me some.''
   The woman was amused when asked if she got the glasses.
   ``Look,'' she relied, ``these people have been promising us
everything for 10 years. And what have they given us?''
   While the Sandinistas knock on doors, UNO has marches.
   ``Ortega, tyrant! Your time is coming near!'' is a UNO chant
heard frequently.
   The campaign on television, although less important, is another
contrast. The opposition is given 30 minutes a night, divided up
among nine candidates so UNO gets 10 minutes every three nights.
   The UNO ads show speakers assailing the Sandinista government's
economic performance _ the country's economy is the most depressed
in the hemisphere, according to some experts.
   The Sandinistas' time on TV is virtually unlimited, and their
ads, produced in Mexico, sometimes appear during the most popular
of the Brazilian soap operas on the state-owned television.
   ``This is a David and Goliath confrontation,'' said a UNO
campaign source who requested anonymity. ``We can't fight like
Goliath, so we've got to save our one shot for when it counts _ and
then hit with all our might.''
   He added that the coalition was holding off its main effort
until the final stretch.
   ``Money isn't everything. Even with all the money the gringos
can give, the human material is not here,'' he said.
   The people who have the organizational skills to make a party
work have fled to the United States in the 10 years since the
Sandinistas toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza, the source said.
   With their advantage as the government party, the Sandinistas
have been trying to co-opt sectors that have threatened to drift
away because of the economic crisis.
   Nationwide wildcat strikes by teachers last March were the first
serious labor unrest this year, after Ortega announced a tough
austerity program in January to combat runaway inflation. Ortega
granted a 40 percent pay raise and the teachers fell back into line.
   Next came a strike by taxi drivers, who protested a doubling of
gasoline prices. The government started distributing new
Soviet-made Lada cars to replace a fleet of old, broken-down
U.S.-made cars.
   The Sandinistas got 64 percent of the vote in the last election,
in November 1984, and Arce says they will be pleased if they can do
as well again.
   ``Any percentage above 60 percent is good, and will push the
revolutionary process forward,'' Arce said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``An Innocent Man''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Framed by two crooked narcs and sentenced to six years in
prison, Jimmy Rainwood enters the vicious world of California's
Oroville State Prison. He is preyed upon by the hardened cons,
especially Jingles, who threatens to make Rainwood the gang's
``pet.''
   Veteran convict Virgil Cane advises Jimmy that the only way to
avoid degradation and probable death is to kill Jingles. A moral
man, Jimmy battles his conscience: Should he kill or allow himself
to be destroyed? He kills.
   The moral dilemma is not fully addressed in ``An Innocent Man.''
His prison experience and the harassment of the two cops on his
release turn Jimmy into a creature of revenge. And revenge is what
sells movie tickets these days.
   Despite the skirting of issues, ``An Innocent Man'' succeeds as
an action melodrama. Peter Yates, who practically invented the
car-chase genre with ``Bullit,'' is an expert of hard-edged action.
He has the advantage of a first-rate cast, headed by the reliable
Tom Selleck.
   Selleck has rarely displayed such depth of feeling. Behind the
titles he is seen as the sure-handed airline maintenance manager,
who won't allow a jetliner into the air before it has been
thoroughly checked out. Because of an error in addresses, narcotics
officers David Rasche and Richard Young raid his house and wound
him in the process.
   Bewildered by the judicial process that believes the lying cops,
Selleck is at first a meek prisoner. Then he makes his crucial
decision, and he becomes a hero to the inmates.
   The prison sequences are the most gripping part of the film.
Less convincing is Selleck's complicated plot of revenge. It ends
with the car-bashing, cannonading and explosions that are standard
in this genre.
   Selleck's strong performance is greatly enhanced by the work of
F. Murray Abraham as the proudly amoral con. He delivers his prison
philosophy with a cobra-like confidence. Laila Robins is properly
sympathetic in the two-dimensional role as Selleck's wife. David
Rasche, looking like an overage surfer, makes a marvelously
sinister villain.
   You might think that Selleck would go to the police when the two
bad cops threaten him and manhandle his wife after his prison
release. But that's not the way it works in revenge movies.
   ``An Innocent Man'' is a Touchstone Picture written by Larry
Brothers and produced by Ted Field and Robert W. Cort. Rated R for
violence and language. Running time 113 minutes.

   ``Popular Songs and Irish Ballads'' (EMI) _ John McCormack
   
   John McCormack made his opera and recording debut in 1904 at age
21. He left the opera stage 19 years later but continued making
records and recital appearances for two more decades. Along the
way, he became one of the concert world's first true superstars, a
stage idol who collected million-dollar salaries, race horses,
homes and old master paintings, but who never lost his feel for the
popular music his concert audiences loved.
   This son of Ireland, though a terrible opera actor, was a
tremendous artist whose vocal glory was renowned. It was the great
violinist Fritz Kreisler, or in some versions Jan Kubelik, who said
McCormack had a Stradivarius in his throat. Sounds, beautiful
sounds, poured out effortlessly.
   This EMI rerelease under the series ``Great Recordings of the
Century'' (an odd title, since records haven't been made in any
other century) presents the songs that his mass public loved, and
that McCormack loved to sing. They range from 1930 to 1941, with
one from 1908. The incomparable accompanist Gerald Moore appears on
11 tracks.
   The listener must have a bent for Irish ballads, or surrender
him or herself to the period sentimentality of the music, to enjoy
this disc. If either is the case, it can only delight.
   The extremely generous program _ 23 songs at 73:03 _ gives the
range of the popular-music McCormack. ``The Garden Where the
Praties Grow'' is a typical, light-hearted ditty of the Old Sod.
McCormack sings a melancholy ballad of parting in ``Terence's
Farewell to Kathleen.'' In the charming ``Off to Philadelphia,''
the tenor is the happy-go-lucky immigrant who ``lately took the
notion for to cross the briny ocean.''
   A more perfect interpretation of ``Jeanie With the Light Brown
Hair'' could not be imagined. McCormack's voice here resembles a
line from this favorite: ``floating like a vapor on the soft summer
air.''
   A sad story about McCormack, who died in 1945, is told by Henry
Pleasants in his book ``The Great Singers'': ``Towards the end of
his life, when nothing but the records was left, he would play them
again and again, exclaiming happily, and a bit wistfully _ possibly
a bit incredulously: `I was a damned good singer, wasn't I?'''
   He was. Even in the recordings made in his mid-50s, the timeless
McCormack sounds like a brave lad about to step ashore in America,
or the young wooer of a sweet colleen.

   ``Good Evening'' (Warner Bros.) _ Marshall Crenshaw
   
   Singer-songwriter Marshall Crenshaw's bright and bouncy
guitar-based tunes seem ready-made for the Top 40. But seven years
after the release of a stunning debut album, he's still looking for
a commercial breakthrough.
   So on ``Good Evening,'' Crenshaw turns to outside sources for
half of the 10 songs. The result is some of his best performances
yet _ Richard Thompson's ``Valerie,'' Bobby Fuller's ``Let Her
Dance'' and John Hiatt's ``Someplace Where Love Can't Find Me.''
Crenshaw's own songs are strong, too, especially the lovely ``She
Hates to Go Home.''
   But artistically, Crenshaw's problem has been the way he is
recorded, rather than his material. Crenshaw albums usually sound
as though something is wrong with the stereo.
   That hasn't changed on ``Good Evening.'' Instead of a clean,
sparse texture that would serve these hook-filled pop songs best,
Crenshaw opts for a dense, sometimes muddy sound. The blatting bass
and hissing cymbals mar an otherwise fine record.

   After 30 years of lending support to everyone
from Elizabeth Taylor to Cary Grant, Martin Landau has traveled a
dizzying route to screen prominence _ from Francis Coppola to Woody
Allen.
   Last year, he astounded reviewers with his performance as Jeff
Bridges' reliable financial adviser, Abe Karatz, in ``Tucker: The
Man and His Dream.'' Academy voters, too. They gave Landau a
nomination as supporting actor.
   Now he plays the central figure in Allen's comedy-drama ``Crimes
and Misdemeanors.'' He portrays a highly respected ophthalmologist
and benefactor who becomes involved in the murder of his mistress,
Anjelica Huston.
   At 55, Martin Landau remains dazzled at the career happenings of
the past two years. ``It's miraculous. I'm very pleased that I have
been given a sort of resurrection, a renaissance. I'm very happy
about it.''
   Landau first heard of the ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' role when
an Allen aide called from New York. Landau asked to see a script,
not realizing that Woody Allen scripts are accorded the secrecy of
the stealth bomber.
   ``I was flown to New York and met with Woody,'' Landau recalled.
``He then had the script sent to the hotel. The whole script, which
was unusual; most actors get to read only their parts. It was so
powerful that it jumped off the page. A tremendous impact, so many
resonating feelings.
   ``I had another meeting with him the next day. We talked, and he
hired me that day. I was fitted for wardrobe before I went back to
California. I returned for makeup and wardrobe tests, then we began
a rather intense collaboration.
   ``The role is very complicated and yet very delicate, almost
like lacework. I felt very strongly that the audience had to
empathize and identify with this character. What he does is awful,
and unless you can take the trip with him, it's very easy to get
turned off by this guy.''
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is an ensemble film, like ``Hannah
and Her Sisters'' but with dark overtones. Allen, Mia Farrow, Alan
Alda and Joanna Gleason carry the lighter elements, and Landau,
Huston, Sam Waterston, Claire Bloom and Jerry Orbach enact the
dramatic portions.
   The perpetrators of the crime are not punished for their deed.
So what is the lesson here?
   ``I think what Woody is basically saying is that people must be
responsible for their acts,'' Landau said. ``In this day and age
there are people who are not responsible for what they do. The
world is in bad shape because of that.
   ``In the '40s, this man would have had a moment of truth and
come around and say, `I made a terrible mistake, and I atone.'
Woody knows very well that there are people who do things that are
less than honorable and go on living with those things.''
   Having worked for such great directors as Alfred Hitchcock
(``North by Northwest''), Joseph L. Mankiewicz (``Cleopatra'') and
George Stevens (``The Greatest Story Ever Told''), Landau was
intrigued by the Allen style.
   ``He does long, flowing takes, not the usual kind of filmmaking,
which is the master shot, over-the-shoulders and singles,'' he
said. ``As a result, it's a wonderful platform for an actor to do
four- or five- or six-page scenes at a clip where everything you do
is going to be in the film. Ninety-eight percent is not good
enough. The other 2 percent makes it less than perfect, and Woody
is a perfectionist.''
   Martin Landau was a Brooklyn boy who started in the newspaper
business at 17 as a cartoonist for the New York Daily News. He left
the paper to begin the precarious search for an acting career. The
turning point came when he competed with 500 others to study with
the Actors Studio. Only he and Steve McQueen were chosen.
   Landau's career grew with Broadway plays and live television
drama. While he was touring with Edward G. Robinson in ``Middle of
the Night,'' he won the villainous role in ``North by Northwest.''
Besides supporting roles in films, he starred with his ex-wife,
Barbara Bain, in the TV series ``Mission: Impossible'' and ``Space:
1999.''
   The state of his career before ``Tucker''?
   ``I was working, which is always a blessing because I wasn't
waiting on tables or driving a cab,'' he said. ``But I wasn't
getting any roles that called on very much of me. I always think of
roles as a pie, and what I was getting was a very small slice, just
a sliver. Just playing an out-and-out heavy in a mindless
action-adventure film, there's not a lot you can do with that.
You're a sort of functionary in the context of that.
   ``For a lot of years I was stuck in that sort of mode. There was
a lot of frustration, even though I was working as an actor. I felt
I wasn't using a lot that I had. Francis (Coppola) opened the door
for me in giving me a character that had a lot of dimension, a lot
of places to go. I'm very grateful.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Realistic Side of Chinese Art</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Mo DaFeng was a young boy, he found
himself attracted to what was a very precarious occupation in his
native China: He wanted to be like his father, an artist, and
become a painter.
   ``When I was probably 5 years old, I liked drawing cars and the
trains and the airplanes, especially some American fighters,'' he
said.
   But his father, who had seen many of his artist friends banished
to the countryside in 1957 because of their political views, tried
to channel his son's talent into other pursuits.
   ``My father thought any son should not be an artist,'' the
32-year-old Mo recalled. ``He thought I should be an architect.''
   Mo, however, wasn't to be denied. He studied oil painting and
stage design at the People's Liberation Army Art Institute in
Beijing, eventually becoming an official Army artist.
   Given his status in the army, his early work was restricted to
propaganda pieces and theater sets. One of his assignments took him
to the front lines of the border war between China and Vietnam in
1979.
   ``If you want to become famous, you have to paint history,
military paintings,'' he said.
   Since leaving the army in 1983, he's used his canvas to capture
scenes of personal significance _ riverfronts and cityscapes, but
never portraits. The result is that Mo is now considered by some
collectors as one of the leading ``contemporary realism'' artists
in China.
   Nine of his oil paintings are included in an exhibit of Chinese
contemporary realist paintings at the Greenwich Workshop Inc.
gallery in the Southport section of Fairfield.
   David P. Usher, Greenwich Workshop president, defined
contemporary realism as paintings ``you can look at and you know
what it is.''
   A total of 110 paintings from 30 Chinese artists are included in
the current show. The paintings were selected from among 400 put on
display earlier this year at the Nanjing Exhibition in China.
   The paintings are bright, bold and feature optimistic themes,
including landscapes, portraits and poster-style works that are
markedly different from the traditional Chinese ink and watercolor
paintings done on rice paper.
   ``I was amazed by the quality of the painting,'' said Usher, who
personally selected the pieces on exhibit during a visit to China.
``When people think of Chinese painting, they think of birds,
bamboo and the mountains. It was a little like Andrew Wyeth and
Norman Rockwell going to China.''
   The contemporary realism style traces its roots to French
academic realism and avante-garde styles and to the Soviet style of
socialist reform. Some of its more familiar examples are the huge
patriotic or propaganda murals visible in major squares.
   The exhibit is the second for Greenwich Workshop, an art
publishing firm. It held an earlier exhibit of Chinese paintings in
November 1988 and had sales exceeding $250,000. The exhibit also
led to the introduction of limited edition prints, which have sold
well since their introduction this spring.
   Usher said his company is the only one in this country to
maintain its ties with Chinese artists. Many other firms severed
their ties with the artists after the army crushed the student
pro-democracy movement in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June.
   Only one of the paintings in the current exhibit can be
interpreted as making a statement on the Tiananmen incident. The
painting by Huang Zhong Yang shows a child releasing a dove from
captivity.
   ``We made the conscious effort to keep working with them,''
Usher said. ``In all honesty, I guess we're a lifeline to the
artists, and if we stop doing what we're doing there would be no
exposure or market for their work.''
   The continuing relationship was made possible under an agreement
Usher reached in May with China's Cultural Affairs Ministry and the
China Artists Association, an elite organization representing about
7,000 artists. The agreement established a network by which Chinese
art would pass through the Greenwich Workshop to about 1,400
dealers in the United States, Canada and Britain.
   Both artists and the Chinese government receive a share of the
profits from sales, said Liu Kuifang, director of the China project
for Greenwich Workshop.
   The business connection is very important to Chinese artists
who, while supported by the government, don't learn how to market
or exhibit their work abroad. There is no market in China.
   ``Out of the 400, you could have put about 80 in any gallery in
the world,'' Usher said.
   Mo's contributions to the exhibit depict the river communities
near his parent's home. His family lives in south China, where Mo's
father, Mo Pu, is the retired head of the Hung Zhou Academy, the
country's oldest art academy.
   ``The color, the river, it's very beautiful,'' Mo said.
``Landscape is one of my favorite objects. If you want to find
people to pose, everyone is too busy.''
   Mo, who has been a professional artist since age 18, currently
is a graduate student at the Pratt Institute in New York City,
where he is studying Western art and artists. He expects to
complete his studies in about two years and then return to China to
put his new skills into practice.
   ``As artist in China, it's very hard. They have knowledge. But
most artists know how to survive,'' he said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The New, Improved Boy George</HEAD>

   Boy George, the androgynous former president
of Culture Club, is trying to climb back up the pop charts after
surviving the crushing downers of heroin addiction and the overdose
deaths of two friends.
   ``I'm totally relaxed about my life,'' he says, declaring a new
state of mind. ``I'm totally relaxed about what I am and what I do
and what I feel.''
   Boy George has come to the United States on a temporary visa,
the first time he has been allowed to do so since his 1986
conviction for heroin possession in England.
   The conviction, which led to the disintegration of the
hit-making Culture Club one year later, forced the singer into a
rehabilitation program. Treatment was complicated by the
drug-related deaths of two close friends, one at Boy George's
London mansion.
   During a recent visit to Los Angeles, Boy George _ whose real
name is George O'Dowd _ described himself as happy and healthy,
with an understanding that life isn't always perfect.
   ``I think a lot of the things that happen to me are
self-created,'' he said. ``There are still days when I get out of
the bed on the wrong side and everything goes wrong. That happens
to all of us.''
   His current solo album, ``High Hat,'' was released to favorable
reviews earlier this year but didn't get much airplay in this
country. He hopes his U.S. visit will spur interest in a
soon-to-be-released single, ``Whisper.''
   The singles previously released from the album were ``quite
funky'' and didn't appeal to Top 40 radio stations, he said. He
also believes some radio programmers don't think the public can
forgive him for his past problems.
   But Boy George doesn't seem concerned that his popularity might
have waned over the past three years.
   ``I have a place in the music industry,'' he said. ``I have a
really good following _ a loyal following. I think you really can't
ask for more than that.''
   Now 28, Boy George hit the music scene at the start of the
decade as a backup singer with the British group Bow Wow Wow. In
those days he was known as Lieutenant Lush. He eventually formed
his own group, the Sex Gang Children, which later evolved into the
internationally successful quartet Culture Club. Boy George assumed
the role as the group's most visible member, attracting attention
with gobs of makeup and a smooth-as-silk voice in a 6-foot frame.
   ``If you look at the pop industry, not a lot of people stick out
as being particularly interesting,'' he said. ``I think at the time
we were the most colorful thing happening.''
   Culture Club's four albums _ ``Kissing to Be Clever,'' ``Colour
by Numbers,'' ``Waking Up With the House on Fire'' and ``From
Luxury to Heartache'' _ quickly became top-sellers in the first
half of the 1980s. This was largely due to a unique style that
combined pop, funk, reggae and soul.
   Boy George, however, remains humble when it comes to Culture
Club's popularity.
   ``We were really lucky. We were just in the right place at the
right time,'' he said. ``It's a bit like trying to catch a taxi.''
   But the Culture Club's taxi took a wrong turn.
   In July 1986, Boy George was arrested in London for heroin
possession. He pleaded guilty to the charge, was fined $370 and
agreed to enter a treatment program for his drug addiction.
   Shortly after his conviction, Michael Rudetski, a friend and
colleague, died at the singer's London mansion from a heroin
overdose. Boy George was not home at the time, however, and no
additional criminal charges were brought against him.
   Then on Dec. 20, 1986, Boy George and pal Mark Golding were
arrested for marijuana possession outside a London nightclub. The
next day, Golding, a 20-year-old musician, was found dead in his
apartment from a drug overdose.
   Boy George was never connected to the death, but he received a
warning for the marijuana charge.
   He is sensitive to questions about those troubled times.
   Asked what he has learned from those painful experiences, he
said: ``I think it's very difficult to put into words. There are
certain things that I feel that I couldn't possibly explain without
making it sound really futile.''
   Nonetheless, the quick-witted star found a bit of humor in the
ordeal, which unfolded across the pages of the tabloids.
   ``I used to think being in the papers was proof I was good,'' he
joked.
   Since that time, he has been working to recoup his health, his
career and ultimately, his life. ``It took me maybe 2{ years to get
over it, and that's a long time, especially for someone like me
because I wanted to work and I wanted to get out and do things _ it
was hard.''
   Sitting in his hotel room in Hollywood, Boy George looked fit
and content. In a T-shirt, sweat pants and clunky hightop sneakers,
he appeared nothing like the old Boy George who favored flowing
caftans and ballet shoes.
   His hair was crew-cut and naturally light brown, and during the
interview he was without the customary cosmetics. But he emphasized
he would be made up after lunch and insisted he wasn't toning down
his look.
   ``I still wear makeup, and as far as I know, I still stand out
in a crowd,'' he said. ``When I get on a lift people still look at
me. So I guess I must be doing something right.''
   He is jokingly critical of other male groups, especially rock
'n' roll bands that have adopted makeup and teased hair.
   ``You look at these heavy metal bands _ they look like a bunch
of ugly old women. At least when I dressed up I looked good,'' he
said with a smirk.
   But Boy George isn't all jokes when it comes to his persona and
career. He is a serious businessman. In England he has an
independent record label, More Protein, which releases some of his
work as well as the music of others. He also is in a new group
called Jesus Loves You and hopes to eventually record enough songs
with the band to release an album.
   In the meantime, he's sneaking around rumors that Culture Club
might get back together.
   ``There's a possibility we'll make an album together, but at the
moment it's a possibility,'' he said. ``Basically, if the songs are
good we'll do it. If they're not good we won't do it.''
   He says he still has discouraging days, and now must take his
life one step at a time. The thing that keeps him going is his
music _ whether it is successful or not.
   ``I'm a songwriter, I love singing and music is my life. It's
not a means to and end for me,'' he said, then added with a smile:
``I'm not making records so I can afford to keep up my mortgage.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Rediscovering America</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHUCK SCHOFFNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Writer Bill Bryson wanted to tell the
good folks of Britain something about America. In doing so, he told
Americans something about themselves.
   Bryson, the son of a sports writer, drove through 38 states in
his mother's Chevy Chevette to compile the material for his
recently published book, ``The Lost Continent.'' It's a witty,
insightful look into the United States, poking fun at everything
from Southerners and recreational vehicles to historical markers
and his own family.
   It also speaks of what Bryson enjoyed about America, places such
as the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Gettysburg, Pa., and
Charleston, S.C.
   ``It was a fabulous experience,'' Bryson said in an interview.
``It was something I had wanted a chance to do, and almost nobody
has a chance to go out and see the whole country all at once.
   ``I can't believe how lucky I was to be able to do it. Not only
to go back to all of the places that I wanted to, but to go to
places I'd never seen and to be paid to do it.''
   Bryson, who lives in England, returned to Des Moines for his
father's funeral in 1987. As he and his brother and sister were
reminiscing about their family vacations, he was struck by the
thought that America had become a foreign land to him. He decided
to retrace family vacations to find out how the country had changed.
   After receiving several rejections from publishing houses, a
small British publisher, Secker &amp; Warburg, bought the rights for
about $10,000. It was just enough to cover Bryson's expenses.
   One of the publishers who originally rejected ``The Lost
Continent'' was Harper &amp; Row, which eventually bought the U.S.
rights for $375,000. Harper &amp; Row's rejection slip is in a frame
hanging above Bryson's desk.
   Bryson said the American firm has been good-natured about its
earlier rejection and, to his surprise, made few changes in the
book.
   ``I thought I was writing a very small book for a British
publisher,'' he said. ``I thought I was explaining what America was
like to Britons. When I heard that Harper &amp; Row bought the book, I
thought they'd probably cut some things and change all this stuff.
   ``Americans already know, for instance, that Washington and
Baltimore are right next door. But they said, `Oh no, we like it
like it is.' They didn't change much of anything. The British
version explains what Bud Light is. That's the only thing that
really got changed.''
   Bryson writes that his intent was to find the perfect small
town, where ``Bing Crosby would be the priest, Jimmy Stewart the
mayor, Fred MacMurray the high school principal.''
   From his opening line, it's clear that Bryson was out to have
fun: ``I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.''
   He describes Des Moines residents as being ``strangely serene,''
and writes that people who have never been there ``drive in off the
interstate, looking for gas or hamburgers and stay forever.''
   Once on the road, Bryson finds ample material for his zingers.
   Like Southerners:
   ``The average Southerner has the speech patterns of someone
slipping in and out of consciousness,'' he wrote. ``I can change my
shoes and socks faster than most people in Mississippi can speak a
sentence.''
   Or recreational vehicle owners:
   ``These things, these RVs, are like life-support systems on
wheels. Astronauts go to the moon with less backup. RV people are
another breed _ and a largely demented one at that.''
   Then there's Nebraska, which Bryson calls the nation's ``most
unexciting'' state. ``Compared with it, Iowa is a paradise,'' he
wrote. ``Iowa at least is fertile and green and has a hill.
Nebraska is like a 75,000-square-mile bare patch.''
   Bryson said he wrote the book with the idea that Americans can
laugh at themselves. If anyone takes offense at what he said, he's
sorry.
   ``I thought it was quite obvious that I was joking,'' he said.
``It was never meant to be taken seriously. If you grew up in a
place like Nebraska and were really proud of the fact and then see
the things I said, ... I could see how you could take it
seriously.''
   Bryson's kidding even extends to his own family. He wrote that
his father, Bill Sr., had two criteria for a vacation attraction:
``Was it educational and was it free?''
   ``His idea of holiday heaven was a museum without an admission
charge,'' Bryson wrote. ``He was so cheap on vacations that it
always surprised me he didn't make us sift in litter bins for our
lunch.''
   However, he was worried that his father, a longtime sports
columnist for the Des Moines Tribune, would be perceived as a
buffoon, so he showed the manuscript to his mother before it was
published.
   ``I said to her, `Look, if there's anything you're unhappy with,
tell me,''' Bryson said. ``She thought it actually was an
affectionate account. ... I was well aware I was using both my
parents as comic book figures for purposes of humor. My mother
wasn't troubled by it at all.''
   Bryson never did find his perfect small town, although he
visited some that came close. Among his favorites were Columbus,
Miss.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Gettysburg, Pa.;
Chestertown, Md.; and Pella and Storm Lake in Iowa.
   And if a foreigner had one place to visit in the United States,
Bryson would recommend the Grand Canyon.
   ``It's the one experience America has that can't be duplicated
anywhere else,'' he said. ``You can go to the Alps if you want to
see mountains, you can go to the Yangtze River and see a river
that's as great as the Mississippi, but there's just no place in
the world that's got a hole in the ground like the Grand Canyon.''
   His worst experience was in Sundance, Wyo., where a gum-chewing
waitress at the only restaurant in town wouldn't serve him because
a group of Shriners were having a private party there. He had to
make do on $6 worth of potato chips and candy bars from a gas
station.
   ``Anywhere in Iowa, someone would have fixed me up with a
sandwich,'' Bryson said. ``They seemed to take a positive pleasure
in the idea I was just going to eat potato chips and candy bars. I
never encountered that type of malice anywhere else.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: From ``Knight Rider'' to Country Music</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tra Star is cq in 3rd graf.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   She once was a computer expert who
helped fight crime with TV's ``Knight Rider.'' But all Rebecca
Holden ever really wanted to do was sing country music.
   ``Finally, I'm getting to do what I've always wanted to do,''
she said in an interview. ``I think I'm happier than I've ever
been.''
   After a modeling and acting career that included a brief stint
on the soap opera ``General Hospital,'' Holden has settled in
Nashville and is making records and music videos for Tra Star
Records.
   On ``Knight Rider,'' she portrayed April Curtis, a computer
expert who helped fight crime. This led to her role as the wicked
Elena on ``General Hospital.''
   When her soap character died, she turned to country music. She's
been the opening act at concerts by country stars such as Lee
Greenwood, Tom T. Hall, Earl Thomas Conley and Ronnie McDowell. She
and her four-piece band also made a concert tour of Canada.
   Holden kept her hand in acting by appearing in music videos with
the Statler Brothers and Ronnie Milsap.
   ``Singing is the only thing I ever wanted to do, ever,'' she
said. ``People get the idea that I'm an actress that's now trying
to sing. That's not right. It just took me a while to make it
happen. If I'd had my druthers, that's all I would have ever done.''
   Holden, raised in San Antonio, majored in piano and voice at
North Texas State University. She had a modeling and TV career in
New York where she also put together a country music band.
   ``My television career blossomed into something I never
expected,'' she said. ``I never had dreams of television or an
acting career.''
   Millions saw her astride a horse in a TV commercial, carrying
cologne on a tray to a waiting, handsome young man.
   ``They glued the bottle to the tray,'' she recalled.
   Then later, she loved the challenge of the soap opera daily
grind.
   ``There is a lot of dialogue to memorize. You do 70, 80 pages a
day whereas on an episodic show maybe seven or eight. The crews
have to be commended because you turn out an enormous amount of
material each day,'' she said.
   ``It was exciting. I loved being put to the test.''
   She calls her singing style contemporary country and believes
she can broaden the base of country music.
   ``There are so many good young artists out there,'' she said.
``I think maybe some of the newer people coming in to an industry
can bring a new audience in. Maybe young people will hear them and
say, `Hey I like that. Is it country? I like it anyway.' Maybe I'll
be able to bring in an audience who didn't like it before.''
   Holden had to pay her dues in country music just like anyone
else, she said. ``You have to prove yourself. You can't just come
and say, `just because I was in television I'm going to be a
singer.' It doesn't work that way. I wanted to prove myself, and
you have to. You have to do your share of showcases.''
   Showcases are performances by singers designed to show their
talent to record producers and others. It's this kind of performing
she enjoys most.
   ``There's something about a live audience and the immediate
response that I like,'' she said. ``There's really nothing like it;
there's magic that happens that you don't get if you're working on
an isolated sound stage.
   ``There's a high you get from it that's unexplainable. There's a
feeling of unity and togetherness from the people that's like no
other.
   ``When you are acting, you get that from whoever you are doing
the scene with. You get those special moments when a scene really
works,'' she said.
   ``Another thing is that when you are acting, you always are
another character. When you are on stage, you are yourself.''

   A dream-traveler ready for intergalactic
adventure climbs into a cockpit and steadies his hands on the
controls. The experience begins.
   Immense robotic creatures lug their massive frames over a rocky
terrain, waging war against the enemy. Every flip of a lever, every
tilt of the control stick fires shrieking deadly lasers,
decapitating other lumbering land giants and splashing metal body
parts over the empty planet.
   It's the latest in video game technology, what creator John
Weisman calls the world's first computer sport. It also is part of
what's new in electronics _ at home and elsewhere.
   ``The desire to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Luke Skywalker in
Star Wars, to not have to live that experience vicariously, I think
that's a very common fantasy,'' said Weisman, president of the
Chicago-based ESP Corp., which manufactures the Battletech Center.
   Players sit in four cockpits and must act as a team in a
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles. It took
Weisman eight years to develop the game, and he plans to open the
first Battletech Center along Chicago's downtown lakefront by
March. Adventure-seekers would pay $6 for a half-hour session.
   ``It got us hooked in two minutes,'' said Brian Bayley, 27, of
St. Louis, as he and a colleague stepped out of the cockpit at the
Consumer Electronics Show, where the game made its debut in June.
   Other items for adults on display at the show included
telephones that look like bowling pins, hamburgers or fish _ a
choice of large-mouth bass, chinook salmon or walleye pike.
   For car buffs, Panasonic representatives showed systems that
project a map on the windshield to keep drivers' eyes on the road.
They also displayed camera-relayed rear and side vision on a screen
in the dashboard.
   ``You can even see videotapes, like one that shows you how to
change a tire,'' said Pat Griffis, a spokesman for Panasonic.
   And there were other hi-tech toys. A microphone changes voice
patterns to any of 16 octaves _ making it easy to mimic film
characters, including deep-voiced Darth Vader or squeaky Mickey
Mouse. The device was developed by Ohio Art Co., creators of Etch A
Sketch, and should carry a $48 price tag in retail stores by the
holiday season.
   Among the new items offered by video game giants Nintendo and
Atari are hand-held games that, unlike their predecessors, have
more advanced television-like screens. Nintendo's Game Boy, which
has a liquid crystal display, will retail at $89.95 this winter.
The Atari Advantage, which has a color screen, will sell for $140.
   Nintendo now also offers a Soviet-developed game called Tetris,
which asks a player to build a horizontal line with a series of
uneven lines and shapes.
   The company is spending about $4 million to market the game,
said Bill White, Nintendo advertising manager.

   Look out, Nintendo.
   The newest player in home video games is out to zap and blast
your Super Mario Brothers with special effects so dazzling that its
electronic athletes dance home-run shuffles and its space battles
display arcade-quality flash.
   ``Dad, I got to get this system. This is the greatest game I
ever saw. We'll sell the Nintendo,'' said Joey Silverman, 9, after
a trial run on the TurboGrafx-16 system made by NEC Home
Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc.
   Ditching Nintendo seems like heresy. It is the hottest-selling
toy in America and Super Mario Brothers, named for its mustachioed
heroes, the most popular game.
   Yet the 20 people who played the systems in a week-long,
side-by-side trial by The Associated Press unanimously praised
NEC's sharper graphics, blazing color and better sound.
   NEC's system has twice the computing power and at least twice
the pricetag. The basic unit lists at $199, with a compact disc
option for an extra $399. Game cartridges the size of a credit card
will sell for $45, and about 20 games will be available.
   A Nintendo unit costs about $80. Its 120 games sell for $25 to
$40 each.
   But even a telecommunications giant like NEC is going to need
more than heavyweight wizardry to challenge Nintendo, which
dominates with 80 percent of the video game market.
   Eight-year-old Emmet O'Hanlon preferred NEC's graphics during a
test run but said, ``I wouldn't trade Nintendo at all. No way.''
   Josh Taylor, 18, agreed after playing a baseball game that
features a post-game show and lacks only gold chains and pine tar
for realism.
   ``NEC blows it away. It's far superior.'' Still, he said, ``If I
owned a Nintendo, I don't know if I'd go out and buy the new one.''
   Jenny Boyd, 12, said it would take ``a million dollars to give
up my Nintendo.'' But after playing NEC, she told her 9-year-old
sister, ``Start saving your money. Any money we get will go toward
this. This is a fresh game.''
   James Herman, 9, was particularly struck by one NEC game in
which a karate-chopping warrior battles bullies. The hero's eyes
blink, his side bruises, and his mouth bleeds.
   ``That's what I call excellent graphics,'' James said. ``This is
such an awesome game.''
   NEC's gadgetry has a 16-bit microprocessor, twice the power of a
Nintendo. A bit measures how much information the processor can
handle at once. Nintendo is testing a souped-up version, and a Sega
of America Inc., subsidiary of Japan's Sega Enterprises Ltd., also
has a 16-bit system on the market.
   The battle for the hearts and minds of video game players is far
from child's play because of the megabucks at stake.
   Nintendo's newest challenger is a hand-held miniature, called
Game Boy, which will be in the stores for Christmas. Each Game Boy
comes with Tetris, the new game originated by a Soviet mathematics
researcher, and nearly two dozen other games will soon be available.
   Nintendo of America Inc. sold $1.7 billion worth of games last
year and sales should reach $2.6 billion this year. Since it
introduced its boxy toy in 1985, Nintendo has sold 13 million in
the United States and expects to have 19 million sold by year's end.
   More than 50 million game cartridges will be bought this year.
The hottest game, Super Mario Brothers, is a morality play that
weaves a mustachioed Mario or his brother, Luigi, each a blipping
Everyman, through an electronic labyrinth of waterfalls and secret
passages.
   The farther Mario goes in the fantasy yarn, the tougher the
surrealistic obstacles, and he's apt to die a thousand deaths
before rescuing the princess from the evil Wart by flinging
vegetables at antagonists.
   One of the newest games, Wheel of Fortune, has an electronic
hand-clapping, letter-turning Vanna White.
   ``They're very compelling. They're so convenient, exciting and
accessible,'' said David Surrey, professor of urban studies at St.
Peter's College in Jersey City, N.J. ``The games are a repetition
of age-old themes. It's still cowboys and Indians, the boys save
the girls, and there's a fear of outsiders where you shoot aliens
and monsters.''
   ``All games are addictive if they're good,'' said Brian
Sutton-Smith, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
``There's nothing wrong with that. It's the nature of good play.
Why shouldn't kids be addicted? Usually, they grow out of their
addiction.''

   Laser video, introduced about a dozen years ago _ long before
the compact disc, monitor-receivers and the home video boom in
general _ has come of age.
   The format is the choice of consumers in Japan, where the
industry is booming with sales of $1.5 billion annually.
   Its growing popularity in the United States probably is linked
to the acceptance of the compact audio disc.
   And since laser-read optical videodiscs have remained compatible
since their introduction, older discs will play on today's new
machines.
   Engineers have taken advantage of this compatibility and merged
the laser videodisc and compact disc into a format they call CD
video.
   A wide variety of programming is available on optical discs,
ranging from audio-only CDs to feature films such as ``Gone With
the Wind'' and ``Rain Man.''
   It might be confusing if you're not familiar with the laser
format, so here's the lowdown on the discs and players:
   Compact audio discs are five inches in diameter and contain
about 75 minutes of recorded material per side. There also are
three-inch CD singles.
   The new CD videos also are five inches in diameter. They can
have up to five minutes of video and an additional 20 minutes of
audio per side. The current catalog of CDVs lists mostly pop
artists featuring their hit videos and selected songs from audio
albums.
   Laser videodiscs containing both video and audio programming are
8 and 12 inches in diameter. The smaller discs most often feature
selections of popular music videos. The big discs contain
everything from hit movies to operas and concerts. One even has an
encyclopedia.
   The 12-inchers can hold up to 60 minutes of material per side.
   Laser CDV players are being sold in the United States by such
manufacturers as Sony, Yamaha, Magnavox and Phillips. Other makers
are expected to join the market soon.
   Pioneer's LaserDisc Corp. of America is the leading manufacturer
of laser videodiscs in the United States, with its Long Beach,
Calif., plant capable of turning out 600,000 discs a month. Pioneer
also imports discs from Japan; they are compatible with players
being sold in the U.S.
   The format is important to collectors of classic motion pictures
because of quality.
   Laser videodiscs are capable of producing more than 400 lines of
resolution and a picture much sharper than my VHS HQ deck. The
higher resolution makes a noticeable difference, especially on
larger monitors.
   Many of the discs also contain digital sound tracks, with the
same quality as CDs.
   There are other assets to laser video.
   Price, for one. Discs usually cost much less; movies that might
be $89 on videocassette go for as little as $25 on disc.
   With the hardware competition heating up, players also have come
down in price, with combination units available for under $500 at
some outlets.
   Pioneer has a basic unit for only 8- and 12-inch discs only. Its
audio circuitry is analog rather than digital, but consider that
discs are easier to store and care for than tapes.
   And the discs should, theoretically, last a lifetime.
   Other advantages of the format include programmability. If
you're watching a concert disc, you can skip to any song you prefer
simply by using the remote control. The individual song you select
_ no matter where it appears on the disc _ will be searched out by
the player in just a few seconds.
   Discs also contain educational features, with such discs
programmed so users can freeze single frames for as long as they
like with no jitter or glitches.
   Laser video also offers audio channel selection, allowing
consumers to choose full stereo or left and right channels
individually.
   A prime example of using channel selection to its fullest is the
``King Kong'' disc from the Criterion Collection. The first audio
channel contains the original soundtrack. The second channel
carries a running commentary by film historian Ronald Haver. This
disc also contains a visual essay on the making of the movie.
   Discs with digital and Dolby Surround Sound add a dimension to
the home audio-video experience as well.
   The direction of technology points to the laser-read optical
disc as the format of the future.

   When ``E.T.'' finally came home on video, he did so ln letterbox
style.
   Videophiles who purchased copies of the blockbuster Steven
Spielberg film on laser videodisc were able see it in the original
wide screen theatrical format _ better known as letterbox _ on home
video.
   Presenting wide-screen versions of popular releases on video
discs and cassettes is a trend many of the major studios are
grasping.
   And in this age of high-resolution, large-screen
monitor@receivers, it's no wonder that video connoisseurs are
gobbling up letterbox videos.
   The purpose of the wide-screen videos is to present films for
home viewing in their entirety.
   Take for instance the breathtaking countryside scenes in
MGM-UA's ``Dr. Zhivago'' or the spectacular chariot race in the
studio's ``Ben-Hur.''
   Without letterboxing of these two films, the viewer is missing
up to two-thirds of the actual original frame.
   When movies are made for the wide screen, they are generally
twice as wide as they are tall, a 2-to-1 ratio. The ratio can be a
large as 3-to-1, as are ``Dr. Zhivago'' and ``Ben-Hur.''
   What most home video viewers have become accustomed to is a
process known as ``pan and scan,'' which keeps the action at the
center of the screen.
   But in the ``pan and scan'' process, the picture must be
cropped, in some instances considerably, to accommodate the
television screen.
   To make the wide-screen process work on current televisions and
high-resolution monitors, the letterboxed material appears
centered, with portions of the screen blacked out on both top and
bottom. For viewers who have not seen this type of video before, it
may take some getting used to.
   Critics have referred to letterboxing as Band Aid video, saying
they prefer a full screen in ``pan and scan.''
   But pro-letterboxers appreciate seeing films as they originally
were intended to be viewed _ on a wide screen.
   This may be too small on a 19-inch television, but on a 27-inch
monitor, letterbox editions are preferred.
   It's refreshing to see Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) talking
to Messala (Stephen Boyd) instead of carrying on a conversation by
himself, as in the ``pan and scan'' version. And the thrilling
20-minute chariot race shown full, instead of chopped to a third of
its original width, is obviously preferable.
   The special effects-laden ``Die Hard'' becomes another favorite,
thanks to letterboxing.
   Because of high video resolution, more letterboxed versions of
collectors' favorite movies are on laser videodiscs than on tapes.
   Other titles currently available in the wide-screen format
include: ``Blade Runner,'' ``The Blob'' (1958 version with Steve
McQueen), ``The Princess Bride,'' ``North By Northwest,''
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1956 version), and ``The Sound
of Music.''
   In fact, many studios are reissuing previously released titles
in letterbox.
   Some tapes, such as ``Ben-Hur,'' incorporate pan and scan and
letterboxing. The newest tape version switches to wide screen
during spectacular scenes such as the chariot race.
   Video jackets state if the program material is in the letterbox
or wide-screen version.

   Tired of watching movies at home because they don't have the
same punch as the ones at the local cinema?
   You can build a high quality theater at home, where your family
and friends can enjoy a real, cinema-like experience. And you don't
have to be a millionaire to finance an entertainment room fitted
out with thoughtfully selected basics.
   The basic components of a home theater are a large screen
monitor-receiver, hi-fi VCR and@or laser videodisc player, and a
quality audio system with surrounding sound.
   Depending on your tastes and pocketbook, a complete home theater
could cost a few thousand dollars or soar onto the megabucks scale.
It took me several years to finance and build my system.
   Since my theater room is relatively small, I decided that a
27-inch Sony monitor-receiver would do the job.
   The only video source driving the screen is a Magnavox videodisc
player, because I'm a collector of classic and blockbuster motion
pictures. I also have a VCR which I use on a portable TV in another
room to view rental tapes. Once I've made up my mind I want a movie
for my collections, I buy a copy in the high quality disc format.
   The audio system consists of an Onkyo TX-51 receiver (43 watts
per channel), a separate 10-band graphic equalizer, Pioneer audio
tape deck, Fisher Dolby Surround Sound decoder-amplifier (30 watts
per channel), a pair of magnetically-shielded speakers at the front
of the room and a pair of surround speakers hung from the ceiling
at the rear of the room.
   Since I had to place the front speakers near the
monitor-receiver, I bought magnetically shielded ones to prevent
picture distortion.
   The final result from this mixed bag of electronic components is
a theater-like experience in my own home.
   The Dolby Surround Sound decoder makes the jets in ``Top Gun''
sound like they're soaring right past you. It also puts the viewer
right in the middle of the action in the barroom fight in ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark.''
   Many of the other movies and concerts in my collection were
processed with Dolby sound tracks for added ambience and less
distortion.
   If you haven't heard a surround sound processor on home video,
try one out at a local dealer. It just may surprise you. (A note
for unsuspecting consumers: the processor must have a licensed
Dolby circuit to decode those hidden sound tracks on a tape or
disc. Don't settle for a cheaper unit which only ``manufactures'' a
surround mode. Look for the Dolby logo on the component or ask the
salesperson.)
   With the monitor-receiver offering more than 450 lines of
horizontal resolution, the picture achieved from the disc player is
superb.
   Simply put, my home theater gets the job done.
   When selecting your components, ask for a full in-store
demonstration. Since speakers are considered the heart of the audio
system, take some time to shop around for them. Be certain they fit
your exact needs before investing in them.
   If purchasing a large screen television or monitor-receiver,
consider the signal sources you will use at home. For instance, if
you are using a standard VHS HQ videocassette deck, then insist
that the salesperson give you a demonstration using a VHS HQ deck.
   Those big screens can be made to look extremely impressive in
stores when laser videodisc players, ED Beta or Super VHS decks are
driving them.
   Save yourself the trouble and disappointment of lugging a big
set home if it will not perform as you expected.
   There are a lot of audio components offered at varying prices on
today's market.
   Select what is right for you and your pocketbook. Stay away from
the frills if you won't use them. Select quality, brand name audio
components.

   The voice of authority speaks with a synthesized tongue.
   The Language Master 4000 Speaking Dictionary from Franklin
Computer Corporation will tell you what it means, how to spell it,
and how to say it.
   Small dictionary-thesaurus or spell-checking computers, often
with extra calculating and storage functions, make up a new
category of electronic gadgets aimed at students, writers, and
other language-conscious consumers. They range from a $60 spell
checker offered by Seiko to the Language Master, which sells for
about $400.
   They come basically in two sizes: the larger such as the
Language Master or Smith Corona's Spell-Right 200 are about the
size of a paperback book, while smaller models, like the Smith
Corona Spell-Right 310P or the Seiko WP 4000 fit in the palm of the
hand, about the size of a snapshot. All feature typewriter keyboard
layouts.
   The Language Master, weighing just under 12 ounces, has a
frog-like, synthesized voice. It includes a dictionary, thesaurus
and phonetic spelling corrector. It can distinguish between
identically spelled words with different meanings and
pronunciations. The synthesized voice tells you the difference
between ``desert'' (last syllable accent, verb), meaning to
abandon, and ``desert`` (first syllable accent, noun), meaning dry,
barren region.
   If set to talking, the synthesized voice could recite its entire
vocabulary in more than 21 hours of uninterrupted speech. It
contains over 274,000 definitions and spellings of more than 83,000
words from Merriam-Webster's dictionary.
   The thesaurus has 487,000 synonyms for more than 40,000 entries
from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus. Enter a word on the
keyboard, and its various thesaurus definitions appear on your
computer screen. Say you want to look up ``stirring.'' Write it in,
and the computer returns properly inflected synonyms _ ``arousing,
awakening, bestirring.'' Then press the ``say'' key, and you'll
hear the word pronounced electronically.
   The program has an advanced vocabulary-building tutorial that
includes 3,300 words often found on SAT, GRE and GMAT exams. It
uses the SAT word list in a variety of word games.
   Smith Corona's Spell-Right 200, selling for about $160, is a
less expensive version of the larger format. It covers 100,000
dictionary entries, has a thesaurus, a spell function that corrects
misspelled words, provides synonyms, and alerts the user to
commonly confused words, displaying their definitions. It has a
built-in calculator which can solve math problems, a foreign
currency converter, and address book storage capacity of 6,000
characters. The unit also has crossword entries, works out
anagrams, and offers a word-guessing game called Hangman.
   The company's two pocket-size checkes, the Spell-Right 300P and
310P, priced at about $140 and $150 respectively, have many of the
same functions in units with displays located in fold-down covers,
making them look like miniature laptop computers. The 300P checks
spelling, while the 310P additionally provides definitions for
50,000 words and has a word game called Skill that randomly flashes
words followed by their definitions. Both have thesaurus,
calculator and word game functions.
   Seiko's WP-4000 in the smaller format is a dictionary-thesaurus
with 90,000 definitions, 500,000 synonyms and a 95,000-word spell
checker, based on Roget's thesaurus and the American Heritage
dictionary. One of its keys lets users scroll through the memory.
This unit sells for around $185.
   Also in the Seiko line are the WP-1000, a spell checker with an
85,000-word vocabulary, selling for $60, and the WP-3000 spell
checker-thesaurus with a 170,000-word vocabulary and 240,000
synonyms, priced at about $135.
   The instrument format has been extended to foreign language
translation by Seiko, which offers four bilingual translators. The
TR-1100 (French) and TR-1300 (Spanish) each have 40,000-word
vocabularies while larger models TR-1200 (French) and TR-1400
(Spanish) have 80,000-word vocabularies. These pocket-size cards
can translate both to and from English. If the user misspells a
word, the unit will guess at the translation, adding a question
mark on the display. A comma will appear if there or multiple
meanings or synonyms. The translators have scrolling and word
locating functions, as well as a backspace key for erasing errors.
Each unit operates as a calculator and currency exchanger. The
smaller models sell for around $90, and the larger for about $120.

   Sony Corp. says it has developed a portable digital
videocassette recorder that allows tapes to be copied or edited
more than 20 times with little loss in quality.
   The machine, dubbed the DVR-1, is the first portable VCR that
uses digital rather than analog recording, resulting in better
picture quality and little picture distortion when copies are made,
Sony officials say.
   In digital recording, video and audio information is converted
into a series of binary pulses such as those used by computers to
process information. Compact discs also use digital recording to
improve sound quality.
   Although the machine is intended primarily for professionals,
such as television journalists, company officials said they plan
eventually to develop one for consumers.
   The recorder will go on sale in January for a list price of
$37,000, Sony says. It weighs 24 pounds, is battery-powered and can
record up to 94 minutes on a single cassette tape.
   ``We definitely plan to produce a consumer model and bring the
price down eventually to about $760,'' says a Sony official who
requested anonymity.
   Sony has been selling a non-portable digital videotape recorder
for studio use since July for about $87,000.
   When conventional analog videotapes are copied and recopied,
such as during editing at TV stations, picture quality begins to
decline after several copies, or ``generations.'' Sony says tapes
recorded on the DVR-1 can go through more than 20 generations with
little quality loss.
   If Sony's digital videotape format becomes widely accepted it
could also reduce present problems of convertibility between the
world's many television systems because of the greater ease in
processing digitally recorded information.

   Tired of all those videocassettes cluttering
up your house? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite
TV soaps or five or six movies on one cassette?
   How about 30 hours of recording per cassette?
   West German videocassette manufacturer BASF says that by 1991 it
will be offering American viewers a tape with a 10-hour capacity.
   Meanwhile, a Finnish company, Nokia, says it has developed new
technology for a line of VHS recorders to cram those 10 hours onto
a tape without the loss of picture quality that results when
today's VCRs are cranked down to their slowest speeds.
   ``The picture quality is better than existing long-play
systems,'' says Nokia spokesman Lauri Kivinen.
   Nokia, a major manufacturer of television sets in Europe, hopes
to license the technology to VCR manufacturers, with the new
recorders coming on the market sometime in 1990, Kivinen said.
   The BASF tape will be usable on existing videocassette
recorders. BASF will use a superstrong, thin polyester film to pile
more tape into each videocassette, according to TV Digest, which
reviewed the new Nokia and BASF products at the Berlin Audio-Visual
Fair.
   The BASF cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on VCRs
with a European system that uses a slower speed than American
videocassette recorders.

   Consumers have had it with commercials on the
videocassettes they rent, even as more car and soft-drink spots are
being spliced onto movie tapes.
   Sixty-six percent of VCR owners surveyed say they fast-forward
through commercials at the beginning of rented movies, according to
a Nielsen Media Research study released at a recent Video Software
Dealers Association convention.
   And more than 60 percent of those surveyed say they zip through
coming attractions.
   Despite the renters' unhappiness, though, the commercials won't
be going away anytime soon.
   MCA Home Videos' upcoming release of ``The Land Before Time''
will carry a Pizza Hut pitch.
   ``Rain Man'' features a Buick plug, ``A Fish Called Wanda''
hypes Schweppes and ``Young Guns'' hawks Nestle.
   A number of promoters created a ruckus at the convention by
offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach commercials for
local merchants.
   Video Air Time of Midland, Texas, will put spots for florists,
bowling alleys, attorneys and department stores on any cassette
where there's room.
   ``We're offering the video store owner an additional source of
revenue,'' said Terry Mathis, Video Air Time's vice president for
franchising. ``The video store owns the cassette. And if we don't
make an unauthorized infringement of the copyrighted material, we
have violated no law.''
   Video Air Time charges about $20 per commercial per cassette, of
which the store owner receives about $1 a tape.
   Paramount Pictures has filed a $1 million lawsuit against St.
Louis-based Video Broadcasting Systems, alleging that the company
has placed commercials on ``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark,'' and ``Eddie Murphy Raw'' in some markets.
   Paramount argues that low-budget local commercials damage the
studio's image. Paramount was the first studio to place a
commercial on a major studio release, adding a Diet Pepsi pitch to
``Top Gun'' in 1986.
   The disapproval rate reflected in the new Nielsen study comes as
a major reversal from a Nielsen study released in April. That
survey showed that 95 percent of households renting the ``A Fish
Called Wanda'' video watched the Schweppes commercial.
   Besides its findings on fast-forwarding commercials, the new
Nielsen study showed that although video rental volume continues to
grow, customers are looking for other ways to spend time, including
other leisure activities, business or education, or regular
television.
   The Nielsen inquiry also found that renters by a wide majority
don't want to pay higher rental fees for newer films.

   With a house full of electronics, it seems only natural to use
the same technology to protect it, along with the house and your
family.
   You can install an electronic household security system that
talks, figures out the type of emergency at hand and automatically
calls the police, fire department or ambulance _ all for about
$600. Or you can use a variety of single-function controls, costing
from about $7 to $75, to increase home security.
   A wireless security system from Dicon Systems, Inc., lets you
program an autodialer and digital recorder to store and deliver
emergency messages. The Dicon 9000's ``intelligent''console knows
which sensor has been triggered _security, fire or medical _ and
automatically places an emergency call to the police, fire or
hospital numbers you have programmed. The machine talks to
answering party, telling them in an electronic voice what type of
emergency it is. Then your own pre-recorded message is delivered.
Each message is repeated three times. The machine's speaker also
features a siren.
   During checkups of the system, its electronic voice guides you
through all procedures for programming and sensor placement and
alerts you when new operating or backup batteries are needed.
   For securing a single door or window, Honeywell's Security Alarm
Bar detects an actual or attempted entry and sets off a pulsating
alarm and a bright, flashing light.
   Automatic lighting devices to make your house seem occupied also
may discourage intruders. Honeywell offers a TimeTracker electronic
timer that turns lights on and off several times a day. The device
also compensates for seasonal changes, turning lights on earlier in
the day as winter days grow shorter. The company's Motion Activated
Light Control uses an infrared sensor that reacts to changes in
heat, so that when someone enters a room, the light automatically
goes on in response to the warmth of his body. Primarily an
energy-saving device for normal room use, it also could startle an
intruder.

   Electronics, having spawned new generations of gadgets not even
dreamed about decades ago, is pumping new juice into old, familiar
household appliances.
   An electronically controlled mixer, for example, knows how to
adjust its motor when a batter gets heavier and gooier and to shut
down when it gets overloaded or something interferes with the
beaters. While it does this, the machine also alerts you with a
warning beep and light.
   The machine, the Black &amp; Decker Automatic Shut-Off Stand Mixer
with Timer, features 12 electronically controlled speeds and a
200-watt motor. A timing control, with a built-in digital display
and pause feature, lets you stop to add ingredients without losing
track of the specified mixing time. And if you're distracted by
other activities, the mixer shuts itself off when its job is done.
   Black &amp; Decker also has applied electronics to one of the oldest
appliances, the iron.
   Its Advanced System Automatic Shut-Off Iron has a light and
beeper to signal when it has reached the desired temperature. The
relative saturation of steam can be adjusted to deal with light or
deep-set wrinkles. For safety, the iron will shut itself off after
30 seconds on its soleplate or 12 minutes on the heelrest, beeping
to alert you. The iron also cleans itself, using ordinary tap water
in its steam system.

   Some terms, abbreviations, acronyms in the world of home
electronics and computers:
   BIT: An acronym for binary digit. Actual data transmitted takes
the form of electrical impulses. These can be thought of as either
``on'' or ``off' or 1 and 0. The pulses are bits.
   BYTE: A unit of storage usually the size of one character of
information.
   COMPATIBLE: A computer system that can also handle data and
programs devised for other systems. (Most common are
IBM-compatible, meaning the computers run software developed for
IBM machines.)
   CD: Compact disc.
   CDV: Compact disc video.
   DAT: Digital audio tape.
   DATA BASE: The collection of all data used and produced by a
computer program. (Also called data bank.)
   DISK: A revolving plate on which data and programs are stored.
Hard disks are rigid magnetic disks in a sealed container; a fast,
auxiliary storage device that makes large numbers of programs and
information available for instant access. Floppy disks, or
diskettes, are flexible disks that provide low-cost storage and are
used widely with minicomputers and microcomputers. They come in
8-inch, 5\-inch and 3{-inch diameters.
   The disk drive is the part of the computer that reads or writes
information on a magnetic disk and moves data and programs between
the disk and the computer's memory.
   DOS: An acronym for disk operating system. It is composed of one
or more diskettes on which data can be stored and one or more disk
drives to read the information stored on the disks.
   K: Abbreviation for kilobyte. It means 1,024 bytes. Similarly,
64K means 64 times 1,024 bytes or 65,536 bytes, not 64,000.
   LCD-TV: Liquid crystal display television.
   MEMORY: The part of the computer that stores data and from which
information can be retrieved. A kilobyte is the measure of the
memory capacity.
   MICROCOMPUTER: A very small computer which has a processor, a
small number of terminals and a storage system. Primarily used as a
personal computer or for a small office system. Storage generally
is less than that of a minicomputer.
   A microprocessor is the processor of a microcomputer, the chip
that contains the ``brains.'' Its processing capacity is measured
in bits.
   MODEM: Literally: modulate, demodulate. A device that allows
computers to communicate with a central data base via a phone line.
   MOUSE: The small, hand-held control device that can be moved on
a desktop to make the cursor move across the computer screen.
   RAM@ROM: RAM is an acronym for random access memory, an area of
computer memory that can be manipulated by the user. ROM is an
acronym for read only memory, an area of computer memory where
operating instructions and other programs reside permanently.
Programs in this area of the computer can be activated, but not
altered by the user.
   SPREADSHEET: A computerized ledger sheet.
   SOFTWARE: Computer programs that tell the computer to do a
specific task.
   SUPER-VHS: A high-performance, high-resolution version of the
VHS videocassette recorder.

   Get Them While They're Young Dept.: Now your three-year-old can
have his own computer game floppy disk.
   Fisher-Price, the toy manufacturer, has teamed with GameTek,
producer of Nintendo-type games, to come up with six computer games
with color graphics for children ages three through eight. Based on
the toy company's most popular products, each costs $14.95 and is
available for IBM PC, AT, XT and 100 percent compatibles; Commodore
64 and 128 and Apple personal computers. --_
   A night out at the traditional big-screen movie palace may soon
be replaced with a visit to a small theater with large-screen
television monitors, run with advanced and high-definition
videodisc, VCR and stereo systems.
   ``Theaters with smaller rooms and smaller screens are showing up
all over the country, especially in shopping malls,'' says Phil
Denslow, technical supervisor of the animation workshop at UCLA's
film and television department.
   High definition television (HDTV) and the cost of movie tickets
will fuel the trend to this bridge between movie and home theater
experience, he says. --_
   On the theory that music should be heard and not seen, Bose
Corporation has come up with a line of stereo speaker panels and
cubes that hide in the walls or pose as light fixtures.
   Audio components can be built into walls when building or
remodelling or installed as a retrofit, the company says. A system
can be operated by a wall-mounted control panel and may cover a
number of rooms. The cube speakers suspend from the ceiling with
single or track-style mounts and resemble spot lighting. The cubes
come in black or white. --_
   Honeywell has several products to make household controls more
convenient and safer.
   The NoTouch Light Switch, making use of an infrared sensor, lets
you turn a light on and off by waving your hand under it. The
switch is useful in workrooms or kitchen, where your hands may be
too messy or wet with paint or food; it's also convenient if you
have arthritis or any other mobility limitation.
   To avert fire danger from appliances that have been left on,
there is the Hour-Off Control, which automatically shuts off the
circuit after the appliance has been connected for the length of
time you set.
   And the Power LockOut Control, enclosing equipment plugs, makes
it impossible for children or others to use an appliance while the
control box is locked. --_
   A computer that's instantly in its program when you turn it on
and has peripherals that snap in has been introduced by HeadStart
Technologies.
   The Explorer is the first ``instant on'' personal computer, the
company says. A modem, joystick, printer, or other peripherals can
be added with snap-in connections. A 40MB hard disk with l0
software programs can be purchased separately and added by sliding
it into the side of the computer, without making the usual
mechanical connections.
   The computer has picture capabilities similar to Macintosh and
is IBM compatible.

<HEAD>Art Program for Alzheimer's Patients Offers New Ways of Expression</HEAD>

   The classroom is alive with activity and
chatter. Women lean forward, intently pasting together fabric,
paper and cardboard. Others draw with bright markers. Some sit
still, content just to be there.
   Florence Skuce, 87, gently claps her hands and inspects the
small notebook she has created. ``My book,'' she squeals.
``Hooray.''
   Dorothy Ewin, 89, says she may use her notebook to record
``little notations of things that are coming up.''
   Emma Maryman, 93, does not speak, but grins broadly at her
finished product, assembled with lots of help from workshop leaders.
   Within minutes, Dorothy has forgotten where her notebook came
from. Others, too, soon will forget. The workshop, however, has
been a success.
   It is one of dozens sponsored each month by Arts for the Aging,
a non-profit group in Washington that uses professional artists to
bring art into the lives of the elderly, particularly victims of
Alzheimer's disease.
   The program sends painters, mimes, harpists, dancers,
storytellers and others to adult day care centers and nursing homes
to involve older people in the arts and stimulate their creativity.
   One week participants may help make a quilt, another time they
will learn pantomime, sometimes they hear stories, often they paint
or draw.
   The program succeeds where countless other arts and crafts
projects ``never seem to achieve anything but frustration,''
reports Sara Gibson of the Bethesda Fellowship House, an adult day
care center in suburban Maryland. The artists ``allow the often
unusual creativity seen in Alzheimer's participants to flourish
rather than attempting to stifle it with conformity.''
   Melissa Brown, recreation director for Iona House, another
center visited by Arts for the Aging, said it gives patients with
intellectual problems a new way to express themselves.
   ``Even the cognitively impaired elderly have the ability to
appreciate art. Art can reach the emotional side of them, which can
still be functioning and in need of being utilized.''
   Artists who conduct the workshops are specially trained to teach
the aged and to help even Alzheimer's patients participate without
getting frustrated at tasks that are too difficult.
   ``We try to bring out whatever is left in people,'' said Lolo
Sarnoff, a 73-year-old retired scientist and active sculptor who
created Arts for the Aging. ``You have to be a little bit more
patient, a little bit more repetitive, but they will do some very
beautiful things.''
   Working with the arts has a ``soothing effect'' on the
Alzheimer's patients and reduces their agitation, even though the
classes themselves soon may be forgotten because of memory
impairment, Mrs. Sarnoff said.
   ``They are incredibly happy when they can accomplish something,
but you don't expect that they will remember. We just live in the
moment with them.''
   Mark Rooney, a painter and art teacher who is Arts for the
Aging's program director, said many patients learn and progress
during workshops, though some may never master drawing even the
basic border that is the first step in his classes. ``One student
makes Jackson Pollock-type scribbling throughout the class period,
then holds it up with a sweet smile to ask, `Is this what you
wanted?'''
   Rooney is fascinated with the work of eccentrics such as Pollock
and Vincent van Gogh and sees Arts for the Aging as an opportunity
to study that art in progress. ``I personally respond to their art
because it is very honest. It's not contrived in any way.''
   An estimated 2.5 million to 3 million Americans have Alzheimer's
disease, the most common cause of severe intellectual impairment in
older people. The numbers are expected to mushroom as the nation's
population ages.
   At first, individuals may experience only subtle changes in
memory. But as the disease progresses it can cause serious
forgetfulness, confusion, irritablility and changes in personality
and judgment that leave patients unable to care for themselves.
   Bodil Meleney, a sculptor and part-time executive director of
Arts for the Aging, said it is one of many support systems family
members need as they struggle with the daily demands of caring for
a loved one with Alzheimer's.
   ``We fit in as a small cog in the whole thing. The artwork seems
to calm them down, they are pleased with what they have done.''
   Mrs. Sarnoff started Arts for the Aging ``like everything else
in my life _ by mistake.'' She said she happened to answer the
telephone at the Art Barn, a community-run art gallery, when the
National Institutes of Health called six years ago seeking someone
to teach an art class for Alzheimer's victims.
   That pilot program was so well received that she began
organizing similar workshops from the Art Barn and last year she
created a separate non-profit organization ``dedicated to enhancing
the lives of the aging through art.''
   Arts for the Aging, financed entirely by private grants and
donations, celebrated its first anniversary with a gala benefit
Oct. 11 at the West German Embassy that featured an exhibit of
artwork by Alzheimer's patients.
   The program now sends paid artists into 10 adult day care
centers in the Washington area and Mrs. Sarnoff hopes to export the
idea to other parts of the country. Arts for the Aging also plans
to create a pamphlet for teachers and caregivers at senior centers
around the country and is seeking financing for a research project
with Georgetown Medical Center's Department of Gerontology to
evaluate the effect of artistic stimulation on Alzheimer's
patients' behavior.
   In addition, the Corcoran School of Art in Washington is
offering a new course using teaching methods developed by Arts for
the Aging.
   Carol Simpson, executive director of the Washington area chapter
of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association,
credits the program with recognizing that ``just because someone
has Alzheimer's doesn't mean they can't be creative, can't express
themselves. In fact, many can express themselves better (through
art) than verbally.''

<HEAD>Age Discrimination Said To Be Pervasive In Job Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>

   Civil rights laws aimed at race discrimination are
increasingly being used by older workers, who are fighting
stereotypes and the nation's unique ``disposable'' culture to keep
their jobs, officials say.
   ``It has become the fastest-growing category of employment
discrimination,'' said Dorothy J. Porter, head of Colorado's Civil
Rights Division. ``It is also interesting that the majority of the
people who file age discrimination complaints are not minorities.''
   The civil rights agencies formed to protect ``historically
oppressed classes of people'' now are handling a growing number of
complaints filed by ``white males over the age of 40,'' Porter said.
   Age discrimination accounts for about a third of the 100,000
cases filed annually with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, said Joseph R. Esquibel, compliance manager of the
regional EEOC office in Denver.
   The most common stereotypes applied to older workers are that
they are unproductive, untrainable and less adaptable, Esquibel
said. And older workers often are earning top wages while a younger
worker could be hired for less.
   ``This problem based on age is an American phenomenan instead of
a worldwide phenomenon. Race and sex discrimination may be
worldwide, but the age discrimination appears to be a manifestation
of our culture,'' he said.
   The majority of complaints are for firings, but ``the most
serious problem, I believe, is failure to hire,'' Esquibel said.
People seldom complaint about that, however, because applicants are
``psychologically deterred'' by hopes they still may be hired if
they don't make waves, he said.
   ``I think it is the most pervasive form of discrimination. It
seems to cross all lines, whether you're white, black, Hispanic,
Asian,'' said Steve Newman, executive director of Colorado's
3,600-member chapter of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees. ``You reach a certain age ... and they
want you out the door. You are disposable. You are human tissue.
You're gone. This culture is just so disposable _ a McDonald's
culture. After you've had your quick consumption of an employee,
you throw 'em out.''
   Newman said management in both government and industry in many
instances has adopted techniques to force out older middle managers.
   ``You call a superintendent in and humiliate him in front of his
staff. If that fails, you bring in a cronie, layer him in over the
old superintendent and take the superintendent's duties away from
him.
   ``You push him off in a corner in charge of licking stamps,
counting how many times the phone rings'' until he or she takes
early retirement.
   However, Newman, Esquibel and Civil Rights Commission
spokeswoman Judy Fester emphasized that workers at all levels _
from clerks to secretaries to executives _ are the targets of age
discrimination.
   ``One of the tricky parts is that many times people don't know
they've been discriminated against when they're laid off. But when
they're replaced by somone half their age and at two-thirds their
salary, they realize their age was probably a factor in their being
laid off,'' Fester said.
   Some age-discrimination victims have won large settlements.
Gerald V. Barrett, a lawyer specializing in job law and head of the
University of Akron's psychology department, said the small number
of cases that go to trial are won as many times by the employer as
by the complaining employee.
   ``I'm sure, if a company, for example, found a manager had said
to an employee, `You're older and you're not doing the job,' they
are going to settle that case, especially when you have a smoking
gun like that,'' Barrett said.
   ``On the other end, you're going to have cases where the
plaintiff is not performing his or her job the way it should be
performed. These are the tough ones. That's where the fact-finding
by the court comes into play.''
   Esquibel said much age discrimination is the result of
stereotyping.
   ``It's just an irrational prejudice in our society that the
older you are the less productive you are. That's a myth. It can't
be shown to be the case.''
   He took issue with the belief that ridding a work force of older
workers and keeping younger ones leads to stability. ``The
55-year-old will probably stay around 15 years while the
23-year-old may be gone tomorrow.''
   Studies also show show older workers are involved in fewer
instances of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.
   Esquibel sees a change for the better as the nation ages.
   ``I think the society is changing slowly, like a glacier. This
fascination with the youth culture is starting to wane. The
nation's work force is getting older. The ray of hope in all of
this is that the employer is not going to have as many chances to
discriminate in the future.''

<TEXT>
   Ed Tarangioli thrives on surprise.
   Looking at his blond hair and straight shoulders, you'd guess
he's a well-preserved 65. He's going on 81. But he saves his
biggest surprises for tennis courts where, after cancer and
cataract operations, he has reigned.
   ``My kind of tennis is to do the unexpected,'' Tarangioli said
during a chat at his Victorian house on a tree-shaded hillside in
this New York suburb. ``At this age, you're not the powerful hitter
you were, but you play a very intelligent game. You build up points
almost like chess.
   ``At the national level, most of the players don't make mistakes
_ they've been playing for 50, 60 years. So you throw in as many
surprises as you can _ the drop shot, the lob, the sudden serve and
volley _ that's what works.''
   A top player also needs ``one great shot,'' and his is the
backhand drive.
   The 5-foot-10, 155-pound Tarangioli achieved No. 1 ranking in
both singles and doubles in the 80s age group after winning the
national grass and indoor singles and three doubles tournaments
with different partners in 1988.
   Rankings last one year, the 1989 roster being based on 1988
play. So far this year, Tarangioli has lost in the finals of three
national tournaments to Jack Staton of St. Petersburg, Fla., who's
playing for the first time in the division. Chances are Staton will
be No. 1 and Tarangioli No. 2 in 1990.
   Thirty-three men hold U.S. national rankings in the 80s division
and 17, headed by Kenneth Beer of Burlingame, Calif., are ranked in
the over-85 group. Eighty-eight names are listed in the 70s, led by
Powell Taylor of Norfolk, Va.
   The U.S. Tennis Association strongly promotes the senior game,
organizing tournaments nationally and sectionally by five-year age
increments. Seven women in the 75s hold national singles rankings
for 1988, headed by Liu Shang-Ku Tao of San Francisco. Stars of the
past, like Bobby Riggs, Gardnar Mulloy, Tom Brown and Dorothy
Cheney are still playing.
   Tarangioli was a high school shortstop when he got into tennis
with a friend who ``wanted someone to hit with.'' The friend
happened to be Francis X. Shields, then a national junior star,
later a top-tenner. They practiced on park courts where, Tarangioli
recalls, you brought your own net.
   He learned fast, going on to captain the New York University
team and play three years in the national championships at Forest
Hills. His best performance was when he reached the finals of the
New York Metropolitan clay tournament in 1929 after defeating Frank
Hunter, ranked No. 2 nationally. Jules Seligson then beat him for
the cup inscribed with illustrious names like Bill Tilden's.
   ``Every player plays a tournament where he feels he can't miss a
ball, it looks so big,'' Tarangioli says. ``That was mine.''
   After college, and with ``no money in it,'' Tarangioli dropped
out of tournament tennis, got a law degree at NYU and became a Wall
Street lawyer and teacher, heading the law department of Baruch
College of the City University of New York for 30 years. He met his
wife, Harriet Cullinan, now dead, at a tennis club in Yonkers and
they had two boys and two girls, all good tennis players.
   He returned to competitive tennis in his 40s, reaching the
finals of the National Veterans Indoor Championship in New York in
1956. ``I made history by losing,'' he said, because the winner was
Dr. Reginald Weir, ``the first time a black man had won a national
championship.'' A woman, Althea Gibson, won a U.S. championship the
following year and Arthur Ashe in 1968.
   To keep in shape, he does calisthenics 20 minutes a day and
plays singles five times a week. Seven years ago he underwent
surgery for colon cancer. He also has had a prostate operation and
cataracts removed from both eyes.
   ``The great thing about super-senior tennis is that all these
men have something to look forward to,'' he said. ``We're very
happy because we have goals. I've won the 80s. I'm very pleased
with it. I wanted to do it. My next goal is I want to win the 85s.''

<HEAD>Indoor Garden Planning Starts During Summer Harvest</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<TEXT>
   In the midst of summer harvest, I've
already started my indoor winter garden.
   Tiny tomato plants have formed true leaves in 4-inch pots in my
``poor man's greenhouse'' _ a fluorescent stand in the dining room.
If all goes well, their cherry-sized fruit will redden in time to
join my lettuce, arugula, basil, parsley and chives in a Christmas
Day salad.
   If you crave fresh greens and flowers in snow time, invest in
lights. For beginners it's a good way to learn the fundamentals,
and retirees moving into apartments will find it a rewarding way to
keep gardening skills alive.
   As more people do it, equipment has improved to meet their
needs. You can begin with basic two-tube stands costing around $50
and graduate to elaborate affairs that may run to four figures,
depending on the size and decor. Seed houses, nurseries and
hardware stores carry them or you can build your own.
   My wife and I share a custom-built stand, six feet long, six
tall and one deep, running along a wall of the dining room. She's
the flower gardener and I'm the vegetable man. More or less
amicably, we've settled ``turf'' conflicts by allocating the two
middle shelves to her plants and the top and bottom to my lettuces
and herbs. We also have a smaller, catalog-purchased stand mainly
for starting seeds for indoor plants and for transplanting outdoors
in the spring.
   Although many different vegetables will grow indoors, space
limits most of us to salad greens, herbs, small tomatoes and some
baby veggies like carrots.
   Some tomatoes, like Florida Petite and Red Robin, are perfect
for shelves, growing no taller than eight inches. Don't expect to
raise big heads of iceberg or knee-high romaine or feed large
families. Tender leaf lettuces like Oak Leaf do excellently,
however, succession plants providing us with salads a couple times
a week all winter long. The same with spicy arugula, also known as
rocket and roquette, which develops a more delicate taste and
texture indoors. Basil, chives and broad-leaf parsley also prosper.
   My wife grows plants both from seeds and cuttings. Among flowers
that have graced her shelves are African violets, gloxinias,
cyclamens, gardenias, miniature roses, Jerusalem cherries,
Christmas cacti and marigolds.
   Trial and error have taught us one vital rule about gardening
under lights: fluorescent tubes are infinitely weaker than
sunlight. This means you must keep pots or flats very close to the
tubes at the sprouting stage or the seedlings will quickly become
spindly and ``drawn'' and you've got to start over again.
   By ``close'' I mean within one inch of the lights. Most stands
have chains or pulleys letting you adjust the height of the tubes.
Or you can use blocks of various sizes under your pots. Shoe boxes
are good for this. After the plants become sturdy, I keep them
within three or four inches of the lights.
   Although weaker than sunlight, fluorescents have the advantage
of steady light as long as you want it. This beats windowsill
growing, which depends on the length and quality of the day. I turn
the lights on when I get up and turn them off at bedtime for a
total of some 17 hours of light. (Plants also need recuperative
periods of darkness.)
   You can buy special fluorescents that promote growth by emitting
blue and red rays. You get similar results by combining cool white
and warm white tubes.
   Sterilized potting soil obtainable at nurseries and hardware
stores prevents diseases and eliminates weeding. Special mixes are
also available, adapted to the needs of certain plants.
   Plants vary widely on moisture, but you can be sure vegetable
greens need dampness. Lettuce, in particular, thrives in water,
becoming bitter without it. Before the seeds sprout, you must keep
the soil constantly moist. This is done best with a sprayer that
produces a fine mist.
   Fertilizing needs also vary. I feed vegetables every two weeks
or so with a spoonful of 20-20-20 all-purpose fertilizer dropped
into the watering can.
   You might ask, why all this in the dining room? When icicles
adorn the windows, we think it's nice to dine among fresh-blooming
flowers. Also, I like to lean over from the table and pick a sprig
of parsely for my filet of sole.

<HEAD>Michigan Geriatric Institute Will Be First of Kind In U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan Medical
Center plans to use a five-year, $6.1-million grant from the
National Institute on Aging to work on ways to take care of the
nation's growing older population.
   ``Our population is aging considerably and people are now living
longer, thanks to the advances in medicine and health care and
their own interest in nutrition and health,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Halter. ``We are now seeing health problems that used to be ignored
that we now have to come to grips with.''
   The average 75-year-old today is healthier than the average
75-year-old was 10 or 15 years ago, said Halter, the medical
center's director.
   The National Institutes of Health projects that there won't be
enough geriatricians in the country by the year 2000 as the number
of Americans over age 85 doubles by the year 2000 to more than 5
million, and that use of short-term hospital care by older people
will rise 50 percent in the next decade.
   The Geriatric Research and Training Center will study brain
disorders, loss of muscle strength and increased fatigue, bone and
joint malfunction, and high blood pressure, among other ailments,
said hospital spokesman Mike Harrison. It will tap resources of the
University of Michigan Medical School, the school's Institute of
Gerontology and other University of Michigan units.
   The aging population is in dire need of such a center, which
will be a first in this country, said NIA Director Dr. T. Franklin
Williams. ``Today's serious shortage of geriatric educators and
researchers is having a negative influence on our society's ability
to provide quality care.''

   Nearly 2.9 million Americans who need
long-term care are living at home. The sons, daughters, wives and
husbands providing that care can often find themselves stretched to
the limit by resentment and isolation.
   ``Take Care!'' a new booklet prepared by two social workers and
available from the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, can help.
   Jane Royse and Sheryl Niebuhr offer advice on managing stress,
coping with difficult feelings, taking time for oneself,
maintaining a positive outlook and identifying and using community
resources, among other subjects.
   Royse is a consultant to the National Council on Aging and
co-chair of the Minnesota Coalition for Caregiver Support; Niebuhr
is with the Community Care Resources Program of the St. Paul-based
Wilder Foundation.
   The booklet, funded in part by Medtronic Foundation, is
available for $2.50 from the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, 919

   Here is a look at some of the key figures in the
nation's financial markets:
   _RICHARD A. GRASSO, president of the New York Stock Exchange.
Grasso oversees the nation's largest stock exchange, which lists
about 1,700 comanies and where more than 160 million shares were
traded on average daily last year. He is in charge of coordinating
market actions with government regulators and Wall Street
professionals.
   _RICHARD C. BREEDEN, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which regulates the nation's financial markets. Breeden
was sworn in Wednesday by President Bush. He most recently drafted
the savings and loan bailout legislation.
   _ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed
plays a critical role in the stock market by maneuvering the flow
of the nation's money supply. In the event of a large selloff, the
Fed could be forced to pressure banks to provide more credit to
Wall Street professionals who need emergency loans to keep trading.
   _NICHOLAS F. BRADY, secretary of the Treasury, can set the tone
for a market reaction as the Bush administration's chief spokesman
on the economy. Brady, who led a White House task force
investigation of the October 1987 market break, said Friday's
decline ``doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of
the economy.''
   _JOSEPH R. HARDIMAN, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the nation's second-largest exchange behind New
York. The NASD is an over-the-counter market _ meaning there is no
central exchange floor _ in which trading occurs via a computerized
system.
   _KENNETH R. LEIBLER, president of the American Stock Exchange.
The New York-based Amex is the third-largest exchange in the
nations and trades futures options in addition to stocks.
   _LEO MELAMED, executive committee chairman of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The Merc is important because it trades
stock-index futures, which are contracts for future delivery of
groups of stocks. Futures traders can use them to hedge against
losses on actual stock market investments.

   Wall Street's Friday the 13th scare reverberated around the
world, with stocks falling in Tokyo and following suit in other
Asian markets early today as trading resumed in full force in the
wake of the U.S. market's near-record plunge.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues opened down about 600
points and quickly recovered about a third of its losses before
falling again in the afternoon. It closed at 34,468.69, down 647.33
points, a drop of 1.8 percent from Friday when the index rose
329.97 points.
   Today's drop was the largest this year. The previous biggest was
a drop of 484.11 points on Sept. 26.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo at 139.95 yen, sharply lower than its
Friday closes of 144.00 yen in Tokyo and 142.05 yen in New York.
But it quickly picked up more than a yen and was trading at 140.75
yen in the late afternoon. There was no indication that the Bank of
Japan had intervened in currency trading.
   Stocks also tumbled in early activity before steadying in late
morning activity on markets in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand
and Taiwan.

Anchor stock from $20 to $21.25 a share. Anchor's board of

retail level, represented a return to the high inflation rates
experienced in the first five months of the year.

   The biggest selloff since the crash of 1987 rocked the stock
market Friday, driving prices into a free-fall decline following
news that a big buyout deal for UAL Corp. had fallen through. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190.58 points, or 6.91

   Currency dealers pounded down the dollar in hectic selling

   Bond prices rocketed higher in heavy trading afternoon as

   Share prices plummeted in hectic trading on
London's Stock Exchange this morning in response to Wall Street's
plunge on Friday.
   Investors were not reassured by a relatively calm response in
Tokyo earlier in the day.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index opened 157.1
points, or 6.8 percent, lower at 2,076.8.
   Friday afternoon's setback on Wall Street occurred long after
the London market had closed for the weekend, and some British
analysts had been predicting an instant drop of up to 6 percent in
the key London index.
   But in unofficial trading before the exchange did open, shares
sank even lower, with the key London index estimated to be 200
points down at one point. The bargain hunters entered the market,
and prices recovered somewhat.
   Dealers are allowed to trade stocks outside exchange hours.
   ``The market is looking for a level which it is comfortable
holding,'' said Charles Larkum, an equity analyst at the London
investment firm James Capel and Co.
   The dollar, meanwhile, sank in Europe this morning. The pound
was quoted at $1.5865 compared with $1.5625 late Friday. The dollar
also was quoted at 1.8490 West German marks and 140.91 Japanese
yen, compared with 1.9025 marks and 144 yen late Friday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where trading ends before London dealings
begin, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 647.33 points, or 1.8 percent,
to close at 34,468.69.
   London market makers moved prices sharply lower in an effort to
protect themselves from any flood of sell orders, which in turn
prompted a heavy outbreak of selling pressure, dealers said.
   ``It's havoc at the moment but we expect the market to stabilize
at lower levels ahead of the New York opening later Monday,'' said
Richard Dingwall-Smith, an economist at the London investment firm
County Natwest WoodMac Securities.
   Michael Hughes, an economist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
said the apparent determination of governments to prevent a
1987-style crash ``gives underlying support for the market, so I
wouldn't get overexcited'' about the danger of a full crash.
   ``I think they have a vested interest in making sure that '87
doesn't repeat itself and indeed they have the experience of '87 to
draw on,'' he told British Broadcasting Co. televisionoin. ``I
think it's particularly salutary that the American authorities do
seem prepared to cut interest rates, and that might help here.''
   Analysts said the London market was concerned that a fresh burst
of computer-driven selling on New York later Monday could drag the
market sharply lower. Stock Exchange Chairman Andrew Hugh Smith
said this morning: ``I certainly do not think there is any reason
to panic.''
   The Securities Association, which governs the Stock Exchange,
held a precautionary meeting in London to assess the Far East
response to the slump in New York.
   Some stockbrokers stayed in central London hotels overnight to
be at their screens early this morning.
   The Bank of England said Saturday it saw ``no reason for such an
exaggerated fall in London share values.''
   Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 190 points in
the final hour of trading Friday with a loss of nearly $200 billion
in paper wealth. The plunge occurred exactly two years after a
108-point Dow drop presaged the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash of
a record 508 points.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve was reported ready to move large
amounts of cash into the American banking system if money is needed
to prevent a financial crisis.
   But that is not seen as an option for Britain, because of
inflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson last week
raised base lending rates to an eight-year high of 15 percent to
control inflation running at 7.6 percent.
   British shares had been on the slide for three weeks, amid gloom
about inflation, interest rates and the overall state of the
economy.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office issued
no statements on the stock market situation over the weekend. Nor
did Chancellor Lawson.

   The Federal Reserve put out the word Sunday
that it stands ready to flood the banking system with money to
prevent the second-biggest point drop in the history of the stock
market from developing into something worse.
   The Fed commitment came as the Bush administration continued its
own efforts to reassure investors reeling from Friday's 190-point
plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who in recent weeks
has been critical of the Fed's handling of monetary policy,
expressed total confidence Sunday that the central bank and other
government officials will do all that is necessary to contain the
market turmoil.
   Darman said that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Richard Breeden, the new
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, were keeping in
close contact monitoring developments.
   ``I am sure they will do what is right, what is prudent, what is
sensible,'' Darman said in an interview on ABC's ``This Week with
David Brinkley.''
   Darman declined to predict the course of the market Monday, and
President Bush gave no indication that he heard shouted questions
about Wall Street as he returned to the White House from a weekend
at Camp David.
   Meanwhile, a senior Fed official said Sunday that the central
bank intended to follow the example that Greenspan set following
the October 1987 market crash.
   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that is
needed,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that his name
not be used. ``If there are any doubts about liquidity being
available, there is no reason to be concerned.''
   The term ``liquidity'' refers to the ready availability of cash.
   The Greenspan-led effort two years ago was widely credited with
keeping the 508-point plunge of October 1987 from wreaking havoc on
the banking system and perhaps toppling the entire country into a
recession.
   While a Fed move to inject massive amounts of cash into the
banking system cannot by itself push stock prices higher, it does
provide a measure of confidence that the government is prepared to
counteract the damaging effects to the economy from a sudden loss
of billions of dollars of wealth in stock prices.
   The Fed's action to supply cash on a liberal basis to the
banking system serves to reassure nervous bankers that they do not
need to be panicked into cutting off credit to brokerage houses and
securities firms suffering heavy losses from a plunge in stock
prices.
   Brokerage firms, assured of a line of credit from their bankers,
are not forced to sell off stocks as the price plunges simply to
replenish their own dwindling supplies of cash. Such waves of
forced stock sales can have the unintended effect of driving stock
prices down even further.
   The Fed official said in a telephone interview that the U.S.
central bank had been in touch with central banks in Japan and
Europe and had received assurances from them that those officials
stood ready to supply needed cash in their countries to counteract
any possible fallout from Friday's plunge in stock prices.
   Officials at both the Fed and the Treasury were closely
monitoring developments in the overseas markets, primarily Tokyo
and Hong Kong. Developments in those markets could set the tone for
how U.S. markets perform when they open Monday morning.
   Stocks were down sharply in the first few minutes of trading
Monday on the Tokyo Stock exchange and the dollar was also coming
under heavy selling pressure, but they steadied in later trading.
   The Federal Reserve was expected to join with the Bank of Japan
and other nations' central banks to buy dollars on foreign
exchanges in an effort to keep the U.S. currency from tumbling
precipitously.
   Aides to Brady said the Treasury secretary had spent the weekend
on the telephone coordinating the administration's efforts to
contain the damage from Friday's market drop.
   Officials said they were mindful that the record 508-plunge of
the stock market on Black Monday in 1987 had been preceded by a
109-point fall the previous Friday.
   ``Things are quite different now than they were in 1987, but no
one knows what is going to happen Monday,'' a Treasury official,
who spoke on condition his name not be used, said Sunday.
   Brady is insisting that regardless of what happens in the
markets, there should be little impact on the total U.S. economy,
which is about to enter a record eighth year of expansion.
   Many private economists said they supported that view.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said that
even though he was looking for another big selling day Monday, he
was not changing his overall economic forecast for moderate growth
next year. He said the economy would be bolstered by growth in U.S.
export sales and continued consumer spending.
   ``The average consumer west of the Hudson River is going to say
this market plunge is just a bad rerun. They saw this movie two
years ago and didn't get hurt so why should they worry now,'' Evans
said.
   Before Friday's market plunge, Darman and others in the
administration had been pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates
in order to spur economic growth and also to drive the dollar lower
as a way of supporting U.S. export sales. Fed officials had been
resisting that pressure, contending that the dangers from inflation
remained too great to significantly loosen credit.
   While increasing the supply of money to the banking system could
have the effect of lowering interest rates, the Fed official
stressed that the central bank has the ability to add cash to the
banking system now to take care of any short-term liquidity
problems and then drain off those extra reserves later when the
market turmoil has subsided.
   Such an operation would have the effect of leaving interest
rates essentially unchanged.

   Here is look at the stock market's drop Friday,
some safeguards against large declines and some other markets that
might be affected when trading resumes Monday:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT HAPPENED:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrials average of 30 major stocks tumbled
190.58 points to 2,569.26, most of it in the final hour of trading
after markets overseas already had closed. It was the second
largest point drop in history behind the 508-point drop on Oct. 19,
1987. In percentage terms, however, the decline was much less
severe, a 6.91 percent loss, the 12th biggest.
   Broader stock indexes also plunged. As measured by the Wilshire
Associates Equity Index, the market value of New York Stock
Exchange, American Stock Exchange and over-the-counter issues, fell
$189.571 billion on Friday to $3.296 trillion, a 5.44 percent
decline from Thursday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHY IT HAPPENED:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Most market strategists agree that a combination of events
played a role, including nervousness over higher inflation,
widespread use of computerized trading strategies and fears that a
prolonged boom in debt-financed corporate takeovers may be ending.
Many say the catalyst for the drop was news that an employee-led
group seeking to buy UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, had
failed to obtain financing from banks for its $6.75 billion bid.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHAT IT MEANS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market historically has been regarded as a barometer
and forecaster of economic health, so any severe selloff always
provokes anxiety. Many economists say single-day behavior in the
market is difficult to interpret, but if stocks continue to drop
then investors and consumers could become fearful and stop spending
money, possibly leading to a recession.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>REFORMS SINCE THE CRASH:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   After Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the nation's major stock and
futures exchanges voluntarily began cooperating to avoid panicky
selling that could cause similar collapses in the future.
   Their reforms include coordinated ``circuit breaker'' halts in
trading when the Dow Jones industrial average falls 250 points or
the Standard &amp; Poors 500 futures contract declines 12 points; a
special ``hot line'' crisis communication system among exchanges;
shared surveillance and audit trail information; expanded computer
capacity to handle heavy trading; and special priority to
individual investors during days of heavy market volatility.

<TEXT>
   In an atmosphere of apprehension and government
silence, the already battered British stock market awaited the
opening of trading today to see if the City would mimic Wall
Street's steep selloff.
   Some British analysts were predicting an instant drop of 100 to
200 points on the key Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 share
index when trading resumed for the first time since Friday's
near-record plunge in the U.S. stock market. The index closed
Friday at 2,233.90.
   However, market experts said it was unclear how sustained any
early London selloff would be.
   Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 190.58 points
on Friday _ mostly in the final hour of trading _ in a 6.91 percent
market slide that wiped out $200 billion in paper wealth. The
plunge occurred almost exactly two years after a 108-point Dow drop
presaged the Oct. 19, 1987, Black Monday crash of 508 points.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it was ready to move large
amounts of cash into the American banking system when U.S. markets
opened today, if money was needed to prevent a financial crisis.
   But that was not seen as an option for Britain, which has been
tightening credit in an attempt to curb high inflation. Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson last week raised base lending rates
to an eight-year high of 15 percent to control inflation that has
been running at 7.6 percent.
   ``We are looking over a cliff,'' said one British broker, who
asked not to be identified. ``The government can't help us this
time, and I think the chancellor might just let share prices take
the strain.''
   British shares already had been declining for weeks, falling
about 8 percent since reaching a post-1987 Crash high in early
September, amid gloom about inflation, interest rates and the
overall state of the economy.
   Wall Street's plunge Friday dragged the dollar down and boosted
the British pound nearly three cents to $1.58, taking pressure off
the British government to increase interest rates yet again.
   The state-run Bank of England said Saturday it saw ``no reason
for such an exaggerated fall in London share values'' as occurred
in the United States.
   Neither Lawson nor Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office
issued statements on the stock market situation over the weekend.
Mrs. Thatcher was scheduled to leave today for the Commonwealth
summit in Malaysia and is to return Oct. 25.
   The Sunday Telegraph said it was evident Cabinet ministers
feared political reaction could make the situation worse. It quoted
an unidentified treasury source as saying, ``It is perfectly
possible for people to talk themselves into a mess.''
   The Observer newspaper on Sunday said government officials did
not anticipate as severe a fall in London as on Wall Street and
that the Bank of England was emphasizing it regards the New York
crash as ``a special case, sparked off by the collapse of the
high-risk `junk bond' market, which does not exist on anything like
the same scale in London.''

   The dollar plunged early today against most major
currencies in active European trading as shares plummeted on the
world's stock markets. It then staged a slight recovery, dealers
said.
   Gold strengthened in Europe.
   The dollar opened more than 5 West German pfennigs down, and
analysts said they expected it to fall as low as 1.80 West German
marks. It also fell more than 2 cents against the British pound.
   Dealers in London said the dollar rebounded slightly after the
opening of trading in Europe. In Frankfurt it pulled back up from
an early low of 1.8490, to 1.8570.
   But Chris Furness, an analyst at Hill Samuel Bank Ltd., said he
expected the dollar to fall further, especially because central
banks have been attempting to push it down in recent weeks.
   ``The market is very, very nervous,'' said a trader at a
Frankfurt bank. ``Nobody knows what they should do. Everyone is
just squaring positions.''
   Said Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover in
Frankfurt: ``Anything can happen. Everyone will be watching the
stock markets very carefully.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 3.25 Japanese yen to close at 140.75 yen.
Later, in London, it edged back up to 140.94 yen.
   Other selected early dollar rates compared with late Friday's
prices, inlcuded: 1.8555 West German marks, down from 1.9025;
1.6285 Swiss francs, down from 1.6720; 6.3068 French francs, down
from 6.4562; 2.0873 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1465; 1,365.50
Italian lire, down from 1,396.50; 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1750.
   In London, the British pound opened about 2{ cents stronger
before shedding a cent to stand at $1.5780, compared with $1.5625
late Friday.
   Gold, which traditionally gains when the dollar and stock
markets are nervous, picked up overnight on profit-taking and
Middle East selling, dealers said. It then lost some of its gain,
which had taken it to a high of $371 a troy ounce, but remained
well above Friday closing levels.
   Bullion opened in London today at a bid price of $368 a troy
ounce, up from $364.25 late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.45.
   In Zurich, gold fetched $366.75, up from $363.70 late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, the metal dropped 32 cents from Saturday to close
at $367.08.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.16 a troy
ounce from $5.12 bid late Friday.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange took their
biggest tumble of the year today but trading was calm despite
Friday's big plunge on Wall Street, which Tokyo analysts blamed on
excessive U.S. takeover activity.
   The dollar opened sharply lower against the Japanese yen, then
rebounded slightly in hectic trading.
   Other financial markets in the Far East, from New Zealand and
Australia to Manila and Hong Kong, posted moderate to large
declines. But on the whole investors in the region, especially in
the rich Tokyo market, did not send share prices reeling deeply as
happened two years ago when Wall Street crashed.
   Amid reports of pledges by world monetary authorities to do
anything to buttress stock and foreign currency markets, government
officials sought to keep investors' eyes on local conditions.
   ``Domestic economic conditions are still favorable,'' Japanese
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters shortly after the
market opened for the day, saying he doubted the Tokyo markets
would plunge following Friday's deep 190-point _ or nearly 7
percent _ slide in the Dow Jones average.
   The closely watched 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened down
about 600 points and quickly recovered about a third of its losses
before falling again in the afternoon. It closed at 34,468.69, down
647.33 points, a drop of 1.8 percent from Friday.
   Volume was a thin 520 million shares, less than the 550 million
shares traded Friday when the Nikkei index rose 329.97 points.
   As the Nikkei index slid lower in the afternoon, brokers were
trying to resist panic.
   ``I am telling you that it's not time to sell yet. It's not too
late if we wait until tomorrow and see how New York will do,'' a
broker at a Nikko Securities office in the central Ginza district
was overheard saying on the phone.
   Several dealers had said Sunday they thought the market could
have absorbed a 1,000-point drop. Monday's drop was the largest
this year. The previous biggest was a drop of 484.11 points on
Sept. 26.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo at 139.95 yen, sharply lower than its
Friday closes of 144.00 yen in Tokyo and 142.05 yen in New York.
But it quickly picked up a yen and closed at 140.75 yen.
   There was no indication that the Bank of Japan had intervened in
currency trading that was described as hectic, with volume 30
percent higher than Friday.
   Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Bank Ltd., a major
commercial bank, said he expected the yen to continue to rise as
stock markets show the difference in fundamentals between the
Japanese and U.S. economies.
   Tokyo analysts pinned Friday's Wall Street plunge on excessive
takeover activity in the United States. They said the situation
otherwise was favorable for stock markets, with interest rates not
a big problem.
   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 2,601.7,
down 180.60 points, or 6.5 percent. An analyst at County NatWest
Security Asia Ltd said, ``If the market in New York tonight is
holding, or down by not more than 40 to 50 points, I believe the
Hong Kong market will be all right tomorrow.''
   The wave knocked about 8 percent off share prices in Australia
and New Zealand, 10 percent in Singapore and 11.5 percent in
Malaysia. Stock indices in the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore,
Thailand and Taiwan also fell.
   If London and New York were watching Tokyo for the most
important sign of how the world's markets would act after Friday's
plunge on Wall Street, by the afternoon in Tokyo and elsewhere,
people were wondering how Wall Street's Monday would go.
   Keiishi Nishida, a dealer at the Tokyo office of Kidder Peabody
Securities Co., said Japanese investors were not placing buy orders
because ``they want to make sure that the New York plunge was only
a one-time thing, and the Dow Jones will not go down further Monday
there.''
   Nishida said today's market action was ``nothing like the crash
two years ago when private investors rushed to the brokers from
early in the morning and sold all they had. I don't think any
investors expect Tokyo shares to drop like New York this time.''
   Friday's drop in the Dow Jones raised fears that world markets
might crash in series as they did in October 1987 when a similar
big drop on a Friday led to whopping plunges on the following
Monday, Black Monday in New York, which was followed by Black
Tuesday in Tokyo, London and elsewhere.
   In 1987 the Dow Jones dropped 23 percent on Oct. 19, the Nikkei
dropped a record 15 percent on Oct. 20 and the Hong Kong exchange
was so flustered that it closed for a week.

   The stock market struggled under a crush of sell
orders today as nervous investors sought to unload shares in the
wake of the worst setback on Wall Street since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials skidded 49.18 to
2,520.08 in the first 30 minutes of trading. But not all stocks
included in the widely watched measure had opened for trading by 10
a.m. EDT because of order imbalances.
   The New York Stock Exchange had anticipated a flood of sell
orders and activated its computers at 7:30 EDT, an hour earlier
than usual, so it could sort out business ahead of the 9:30 EDT
market opening. Nonetheless, trading in numerous stocks was delayed.
   Losers raced to a big lead over gaining ones on the Big Board,
with 815 shares down in price, 104 up and 172 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 74.91 million shares after a
half hour of trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.09 to 182.47.
   Wall Street analysts were reluctant to speculate how the market
might fare today after the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Friday. Markets overseas, which had closed by
the time the New York slide started Friday, were knocked down by
powerful selling waves today.
   Among components of the Dow Jones industrial average, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph shed [ to 39|, USX fell ~ to 32[,
International Business Machines fell 3{ to 98{, Eastman Kodak fell
1[ to 43|, General Motors dropped [ to 42~ and Procter &amp; Gamble
lost 2} to 117.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average sank 190.58 points,
or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. It was the second biggest point drop
in history, exceeded only by the 508-point loss on Black Monday,
Oct. 19, 1987.
   NYSE volume totaled 251.17 million shares, up from 160.12
million in the previous session and the heaviest total since 254.87
million traded on Jan. 27.
   Declining issues swamped advances by about 11 to 1 in nationwide
trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 153 up, 1,600 down and 228
unchanged. Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 288.43 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index tumbled 11.43 to 185.55. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down 16.56 at
378.45.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index futures bounced
higher early today on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, rallying
after a brief ``circuit breaker'' trading restriction was triggered
by a selloff at the opening.
   After the first hour of trading, the contract for December
delivery of the 500 stocks comprising the S&amp;P 500 index was trading
more than 8 points above Friday's close of 328.85.
   The contract had opened 5 points below Friday's close,
triggering a ``circuit-breaker'' rule preventing traders from
selling below that level for 10 minutes. But buying surfaced
minutes after the opening, trimming the loss, and trading never
came to a halt because there were always orders to sell at the
limit or buy above the limit, said Merc spokeswoman Julie Jacobs.
   ``Now it looks like a normal trading day,'' said Iris Poliski,
another Merc spokeswoman.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade said today it had added a
20-point opening limit to its Major Market Index contract, a
stock-index futures product that is not as heavily traded as the
Merc's S&amp;P 500 contract.
   The MMI opened sharply lower but did not immediately drop by 20
points, which would have triggered a 30-minute halt to all trading
in the contract, said BOT spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   The limits are designed to slow the markets and prevent panic
selling in the event of a sudden collapse of stock prices.
   Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of
stocks at specified prices by a specified date. Large institutional
investors use stock-index futures in various trading strategies to
profit from the difference between stock prices and futures prices.
   The index futures had tumbled Friday, triggering a trading halt
in the S&amp;P 500 index futures, when stocks plunged on Wall Street in
the second-worst market selloff ever.

   A powerful selling wave hit the stock market
today in the wake of the worst setback on Wall Street since the
crash of 1987.
   Prices of blue chip stocks rocked back and forth. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials, which skidded more than 49 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading, was down 3.28 at 2,565.98 by 11 a.m.
EDT. Most of the stocks included in the widely watched measure had
opened for trading.
   Early trading volume was even heavier than on Black Monday, Oct.
19, 1987, according to Richard Torrenzano, the New York Stock
Exchange's chief spokesman.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 193.44 million shares after
ninety minutes of trading, which would be a large amount for an
entire day.
   The NYSE had anticipated a flood of orders and activated its
computers at 7:30 EDT, an hour earlier than usual, so it could sort
out business ahead of the 9:30 EDT market opening. Nonetheless,
trading in numerous stocks was delayed.
   Losers outran gaining ones by about 7 to 1 on the Big Board,
with 1,380 down in price, 194 up and 199 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
recovered most of its earlier loss and was down 0.66 to 184.90.
   Wall Street analysts were reluctant to speculate how the market
might fare today after the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices edged lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting a
weekend of good harvesting weather and heavy farmer selling of
their crops.
   Friday's plunge in the stock market appeared to have little
effect on the grain markets.
   Because of the advancing harvest and the farmer selling, ``we
would have opened lower anyway,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Weather forecasts generally call for continued good harvesting
conditions in the Midwest through the middle of next week, although
rain and colder temperatures are expected in the next few days.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to } cent lower with
the contract for December delivery at $4.06 a bushel; corn futures
were } cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.32\ a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 1} cents lower with December at $1.38} a

at $5.44 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower in early trading
today on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid stock-market jitters.
   Live cattle were .35 cent to .95 cent lower with October at
73.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .85 cent lower

1.10 cents lower with October at 47.77 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .12 cent to 1.15 cents lower with February at 50.40

   President Bush, trying to reassure troubled
financial markets, said today he was not worried about the stock
market's plunge. And he and the Federal Reserve Board chairman said
the central bank and other government agencies were keeping a close
eye on developments.
   ``It goes without saying that we at the Federal Reserve are
watching developments in financial markets rather closely,'' Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan told the American Bankers Association. ``We
maintained particular surveillance overnight of Asian and European
markets and have kept in productive contact with our counterparts
abroad.
   ``Coordination exists at a detailed level here in the United
States among the Federal Reserve, the SEC (Securities and Exchange
Commission), the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and
the Treasury Department,'' Greenspan said in his first comments
since the stock market plummeted 190 points on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 49.18
points in the first 30 minutes of trading this morning, but
rebounded to go up 18.65 points after 90 minutes.
   Bush was asked about the stock market today at a picture-taking
session in the White House. ``I'm not worried,'' he said.
   Addressing a reporter, the president said, ``You ask if I'm
worried. No. The Federal Reserve and the SEC (Securities and
Exchange Commission) and the secretary of the Treasury are
monitoring the situation and that's where it stands right now.''
   A senior Fed official, speaking on condition of anonymity
Sunday, said the central bank was prepared to flood the banking
system with money to prevent any further stock decline from
rippling out of control.
   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that is
needed,'' the official said in a telephone interview. ``If there
are any doubts about liquidity being available, there is no reason
to be concerned.''
   The term ``liquidity'' refers to the ready availability of cash.
   Developments in overseas markets today were expected to set the
tone for U.S. markets.
   In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange took its biggest tumble of
the year, but trading was calm in light of Wall Street's big
plunge. The dollar, after opening sharply lower, was firm. In
London, share prices plummeted in heavy but orderly trading. Stocks
fell sharply on other European exchanges but then firmed.
   The Fed official said the central bank's counterparts in Japan
and Europe had given assurances that they stood ready to supply
needed cash to the banking systems in their countries to stem any
fallout from the U.S. plunge.
   The world's central banks also were prepared to intervene if
necessary by buying dollars to keep the value of the U.S. currency
from falling precipitously, the official said.
   For the 6,500 bankers gathered for cocktails and conferences,
market events are reminiscent of the opening of the group's 1987
convention in Dallas when the market crashed 508 points, causing
Greenspan to abruptly cancel his speech and jet back to Washington.
   Greenspan was widely credited with decisive action that
prevented the 1987 crash from wreaking havoc on the banking system
and perhaps toppling the entire country into a recession.
   While the injection by the Fed of massive amounts of cash into
the system cannot by itself push stocks higher, it does serve to
reassure nervous bankers that they need not cut off credit to
securities firms suffering heavy losses.
   The brokerage houses, assured of a reliable line of credit, then
can refrain from selling stock simply to replace their dwindling
supplies of cash. Such waves of forced sales can drive prices down
even further.
   C.C. Hope, a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said the regulatory agency had asked banks to stand ready to
help if asked by the Fed.
   ``The banks are ready to participate. ... The Fed has lined up
the players,'' he said. ``We've just expressed our concern to some
people and said, `Stand by and be ready to do some assistance if
you're called upon.'''
   Meanwhile, a senior Bush administration official, who last month
sharply criticized the Fed's policy of fighting inflation with high
interest rates, expressed confidence in the central bank's ability
to contain market turmoil today.
   ``I am sure they will do what is right, what is prudent, what is
sensible,'' budget director Richard Darman said Sunday in an
interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a statement Friday,
said the stock plunge would not affect the continuation of moderate
growth for the entire U.S. economy.
   The bankers at their convention Sunday for the most part agreed.
Some said the market shock may be a blessing in disguise if it
encourages a new sense of caution about highly leveraged corporate
buyouts.
   It was a snag in bank financing for a buyout of United Airlines
that sparked Friday's selloff.
   ``What we were seeing was a house of cards, bound to come
tumbling down,'' said Donald T. Senterfitt, vice chairman of Sun
Trust Bank Inc. in Orlando, Fla. ``I hope the United Airlines thing
marks a more conservative approach by banking throughout.''
   Thomas P. Rideout, outgoing president of the bankers'
association and vice chairman of First Union National Bank in
Charlotte, N.C., said it is natural that with signs of economic
softness emerging banks would apply tougher lending standards to
buyouts.
   ``This would be the wrong time to invest in an airline, or any
other industry, if you think you have doubts about their bottom
line,'' he said.

   Major retailer K mart Corp. will purchase
PACE Membership Warehouse Inc. for about $322 million under an
agreement announced Monday.
   The board of PACE has approved the agreement and recommended
that stockholders tender their shares, K mart and PACE said in a
joint news release. K mart will pay $23 a share.
   The acquisition of PACE would expand discounter K mart's
business in warehouse retailing. K mart already has a warehouse
club chain, called Makro Inc., which has six outlets in the
Cincinnati, Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cleveland areas.
   After the takeover, PACE and Makro will continue to be operated
under their present managements.
   ``The membership warehouse concept has great potential, and the
long-term prospects for PACE Membership Warehouse and its employees
will be enhanced by the affiliation with K mart,'' said Joseph E.
Antonini, K mart's chairman and chief executive officer, and Wayne
H. Patterson, PACE's chairman and co-CEO.
   PACE, based in Aurora, Colo., has operations in 11 states. Its
41 outlets are in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania. The company had 1988 revenue of $1.3 billion.
   K mart has 4,150 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and
Canada, including 2,283 K mart discount stores, 1,247 Waldenbooks,
279 Pay Less Drug stores and 141 Builders Square outlets.
   K mart, with 1988 revenue of $27.3 billion, is the country's
second biggest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co.

   The U.S. coal industry produced 19 million short tons in the
same week last year, according to the department's Energy
Information Administration.
   A short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.
   Domestic coal production so far this year is 740.2 million short
tons, 5.8 percent above last year's production at this time, the
agency said.
   The week's production accounts for bituminous and lignite coal.

<HEAD>Customers Flood Fidelity With Calls, But Not Pulling Out Entirely</HEAD>

   Customers of Fidelity Investments, the nation's
largest mutual fund company, are shifting their money out of the
stock market due to the turmoil on Wall Street, but volume has been
lower than during the 1987 crash, a spokesman said today.
   Lawrence Dwyer, a spokesman for Fidelity, said this morning the
company received about twice as many calls as normal since the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged about 190 points on Friday.
   But he said that two years, during the Black Monday collapse of
Oct. 19, 1987, the phone volume was about double that amount.
   Also, while many people are asking to redeem their investments
in stock funds, ``redemptions are running just about under a third
of what we ran into in the stock market crash,'' he said.
   Dwyer said most people who redeem their stock investments simply
move their money into a more conservative investment fund, such as
a money market mutual fund.
   ``They still have their money and want to invest it,'' he said.
``But they just want to put it in more conservative investments.''
   A mutual fund is an organization that pools and invests money of
its shareholders in a group of securities.
   Fidelity polled its customers over the weekend, and 84 percent
said they were investing for the long term, Dwyer said.
   Mutual fund investors, in general, ``have a pretty good
understanding of what they're in _ they just don't leap,'' said
Betty Hart, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington organization that represents mutual funds.
   Hart said her agency surveyed stock mutual fund customers around
the country after the 1987 crash, and found that only 4 percent
withdrew their investments completely within the first six weeks.
   ``We're probably going to see investors staying the course,''
said John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard Group, a mutual fund
company in Valley Forge, Pa.
   ``They've learned the lessons from '87,'' he said. ``If they
would have stayed put, it would have been better than switching
out.''

   The U.S. Treasury bond market fell sharply in
early trading today as investors cashed in on Friday's big price
runup that had stemmed from a move to safer fixed-income
investments from a plummeting stock market.
   In other credit markets, high-yield ``junk'' bonds continued to
decline in value but trading activity was picking up from last
week's near-standstill and prices were showing some signs of
recovering from today's opening slump, traders said.
   Investment-grade corporate bonds were slightly higher while
municipal bonds turned mixed, they said.
   Overseas, bond prices were mostly higher, reflecting the decline
in stock prices abroad. Yields on the Eurobond markets, for
example, were down around 0.25 percentage point in afternoon
trading.
   Market experts said most of today's slump in the U.S. market
came from profit-taking, particularly in Treasury bonds.
   ``We're getting the flip side of Friday,'' said Maria F.
Ramirez, managing director and money market economist for Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Greater opportunities (for profits) like
this don't come that often.''
   On Friday, prices of some government bonds rose as much as $25
per $1,000 face value and yields skidded to levels not seen in two
years following a 190.58-point tumble on the Dow Jones Industrial
average. Concerns about corporate takeovers and the junk bonds that
are often used to finance them helped stoke he panicky selling in
stocks.
   Fixed-income securities _ especially Treasury bonds _ often are
viewed as a safe haven in times of turmoil on Wall Street.
   Today, stock prices were mostly lower in volatile trading. But
bond traders said the fact that the stock market wasn't as far off
as many speculated kept a lid on bond prices.
   ``A lot of people thought the stock market would be a lot
weaker,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money market
reserach for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``(But) the market's
tentative. It could rebound very sharply if the equity market goes
into a full-fledged retreat.''
   By midday today in the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the
bellwether 30-year issue was off about 1| point, or $16.25 per
$1,000 face amount, after rising around $20 on Friday.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, jumped to 7.96
percent from late Friday's rate of 7.88 percent, the lowest level
since early April 1987.
   Prices of short-term government issues fell between [ point and
3-16 point, intermediate maturities were down around 5-16 point,
and long-term issues declined by around 1| point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, stood at 1,191.79, down 4.58.
   Meanwhile, yields on three-month Treasury bills soared to 7.45
percent as the discount rose 28 basis points to 7.23 percent.
Yields on six-month bills jumped to 7.67 percent as the discount
rose 25 basis points to 7.31 percent. Yields on one-year bills
increased to 7.73 percent as the discount rose 24 basis points to
7.24 percent.
   In corporate bond trading, highly rated issues gained some
ground today. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which
measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.91 to 337.33.
   High-yield, non-investment-grade ``junk'' bonds continued to
decline today, although many traders said some issues that had
fallen as much as $30 or $50 per $1,000 face value, were showing
less severe losses of around $10 or $20 by midday.
   ``The market is also more active,'' said Ray Lemanski, a
managing director Prudential-Bach Securities Inc. ``At least there
are some people saying maybe it's going cheap enough that they
deserve to be bought.''

   Strong selling hit most stocks today in the wake
of the worst setback on Wall Street since the crash of 1987 but
blue chip shares rallied after an initial slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which skidded more than
49 points in the first 30 minutes of trading, sported a gain of
43.24 points at 2,612.09 by noon on Wall Street.
   Trading volume was extremely heavy. Volume on the Big Board came
to 255.04 million shares at noon on Wall Street, which would be a
hefty amount for an entire day. By midday on Friday a more typical
80.86 million shares had changed hands.
   Losers outpaced gainers by a wide margin on the Big Board, with
1,282 down in price, 343 up and 225 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
recovered its earlier loss and was up 1.60 to 187.16.
   Wall Street analysts were reluctant to speculate how the market
might fare during the remainder of the day, the first session since
the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.
   Markets overseas, which had closed by the time the New York
slide started Friday, reacted with moderate to large declines today.
   Stocks rocked back and forth in morning activity in the United
States. Substantial price declines encouraged some buyers to hunt
for bargains, which helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average.
Computer-driven program trading also contributed to the price
swings.
   Most components of the Dow Jones industrial average showed gains
at midday. Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph, up 1] to 41[, USX, up ] to 33], Eastman Kodak, up [ to
44~, General Electric, up [ to 54] and Philip Morris, up 1{ to 42{.
   One loser was International Business Machines, which today
announced a 29.7 percent slump in third-quarter earnings. IBM fell
2[ to 99~.
   Market strategists blamed a series of factors for sending the
stock market into a tailspin on Friday. Disappointing inflation and
interest rate prospects had an influence on the selling and program
trading intensified the decline.
   Word that an employee-led group seeking to buy UAL for $6.75
billion had failed to secure financing was cited as the direct
cause of the market's drop. The news cast doubts on all future
debt-financed corporate takeovers.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, plunged to 224}, down 55 from
the point at which it was halted Friday.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average sank 190.58 points,
or 6.91 percent, to 2,569.26. It was the second biggest point drop
in history, exceeded only by the 508-point loss on Black Monday,
Oct. 19, 1987.

   Stock prices plummeted across Europe Monday in
their first response to Wall Street's Friday the 13th plunge, but
then recovered on a better-than-expected performance in New York
later in the day.
   Trading was disrupted in several European financial centers as
the price declines triggered European versions of ``circuit
breakers'' and prompted authorities in some countries to step in
and try to contain the damage.
   European traders reported price declines of 3 percent to 15
percent.
   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell
70.5 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 2,163.4. At its lowest
point, in the early afternoon, the index was off nearly 200 points,
or 9 percent, as investors grew nervous about Wall Street's
approaching opening.
   The narrower FT-SE 30-stock index closed down 76.3 points, or
4.2 percent, to 1,738.7.
   Volume on the London exchange came to an extremely heavy 959.3
million shares, more than double Friday's volume of 457.7 million
shares.
   But stock prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in
their steepest fall ever, with the German Stock Index plunging
203.56 points, or 12.8 percent, to close at 1,385.72.
   In Athens, the main market index fell 144 units, or 11.3
percent, to 1,130.32 at the close. On the Oslo market, the main
indicator fell 59 points, or about 11 percent, to close at 464.
   Wall Street's big decline Friday came after the European markets
had closed for the weekend and the Tokyo market's relatively calm
response earlier Monday did not reassure European investors.
   British Airways PLC, meanwhile, reiterated Monday it planned to
pursue the acquisition of UAL Corp. together with a United Airlines
management group, although it said the terms of the deal were under
review.
   The failure of the bidding group to line up financing for the
buyout contributed to Friday's debacle on Wall Street.
   Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said the
British slump was not surprising, and he saw no reason for it have
an impact on the economy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the London market opened,
the Nikkei Stock Average fell 647.33 points, or 1.8 percent, to
close at 34,468.69 Monday.
   But official trading was delayed indefinitely on the Brussels
exchange, and for 30 minutes in Frankfurt, because of an excess of
sell orders, stock exchange officials said.
   A spokesman for the West German central bank, the Bundesbank,
said, ``We're observing the situation very intensively. We've been
in constant contact with the affected countries.'' He requested
anonymity.
   Trading in most shares listed on the Paris Stock Exchange was
temporarily suspended Monday morning because of insufficient buying
orders, traders said.
   It was the largest number of stocks suspended since the October
1987 world shares crash, and not enough stocks were being traded to
allow a percentage calculation of the Paris market fall.
   Such suspensions take effect when shares fall by more than 15
percent.
   Within the first 15 minutes of trading in Milan, stock market
controllers had suspended trading in several shares for excessive
price movements. Officials said the measures were ``urgent and
temporary.''
   In Amsterdam, the Bourse's management limited share price
changes to 3 guilders, the equivalent of $1.43, requiring a
15-minute cooling-off period if they exceed that limit. Traders
called the move highly unusual.
   The London market, Europe's largest, was less feverish than
during the 1987 crash, dealers said, and London's Stock Exchange
said the trading system was holding up well.
   ``There isn't the same panic as there was during the 1987
crash,'' said Bob Wade, joint head of market making at Robert
Fleming and Co. ``So the pressure on the dealing machinery hasn't
been so intense.''
   The plunge of 190 points in Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial
average Friday occurred two years after a 108-point Dow drop
presaged the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash of a record 508
points.
   The Bank of England said Saturday it saw ``no reason for such an
exaggerated fall in London share values.''
   It called the New York price fall ``a special case, sparked off
by the collapse of the high-risk `junk bond' market, which does not
exist on anything like the same scale in London.''
   Michael Hughes, an economist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
said on BBC-TV that the apparent determination of governments to
prevent a 1987-style crash ``gives underlying support for the
market, so I wouldn't get overexcited'' about the danger of a full
crash.
   ``I think they have a vested interest in making sure that '87
doesn't repeat itself and indeed they have the experience of '87 to
draw on,'' he said.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve was reported ready to move large
amounts of cash into the American banking system if money was
needed to prevent a financial crisis. An option would be to lower
interest rates.
   But that was not seen as a choice for Britain, because of its
7.6-percent annual inflation rate. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson last week raised base lending rates to an eight-year
high of 15 percent to control inflation.

   President Bush was poised to sign an order
today cutting federal programs by $16 billion. A spokesman said
Bush still hoped for a last-minute compromise, but ``it might even
be good'' if the budget ax does fall.
   Meanwhile, budget director Richard Darman said the cuts will be
felt faster than the last time they were invoked.
   The cutbacks are required under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget
law because of the failure of Congress and the White House to agree
on a deficit-reduction package.
   Unless the House and Senate work out a compromise version of
their deficit-cutting bills and send it to Bush by midnight _
considered virtually impossible because many lawmakers were out of
town _ the president is required to sign the order.
   ``The very, very high odds are that ... we'll end up in
sequester,'' the formal name for the automatic cuts, Richard
Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told
reporters today.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would sign an order
this afternoon that will appear in Tuesday's Federal Register
specifying the across-the-board cuts in most federal programs,
outside of Social Security and other entitlements.
   If Congress somehow managed to pass a stripped-down
deficit-reduction bill and sent it to Bush before midnight, the
president would sign it and there would be no cuts, Fitzwater said.
   But echoing comments that Darman made Sunday, the White House
spokesman said ``it's not the end of the world, and there are some
reasons why it might even be good'' if the reductions took effect.
   ``There would be sizable cuts and they would be real. They
wouldn't be any accounting changes. They'd be real money that
wouldn't be spent,'' said Fitzwater.
   Darman said the cuts will be imposed at a very low level of
federal agency operations, making it harder for bureaucrats to
transfer money to compensate for the reductions.
   When the automatic cuts were last invoked for two months in
1987, they were applied at a higher level, making them easier to
deal with, and they were barely noticed by most Americans.
   ``It has a little more discipline to it,'' Darman said of the
changed method of imposing the cuts.
   The reductions, spread evenly across many defense and domestic
programs, are expected to total about $8.1 billion for defense and
$8.1 billion for domestic initiatives. That works out to reductions
of about 4.3 percent in defense programs and 5.3 percent in
domestic agencies.
   The cuts are expected to be rolled back as soon as Congress
works out a compromise deficit-reduction bill. The Senate approved
its version of the measure late Friday, and House-Senate
negotiators could begin their meetings this week.
   But Darman said Sunday it might be best if Congress left the
spending cuts in place instead of rolling them back.
   ``This time, if it goes into effect, I think it would be good if
people would live with it and say, `don't restore the cuts,'''
Darman said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   Automatic budget cuts took effect in 1986 and 1987 as well, but
Congress acted quickly to restore the lost funds, a process that
Darman called ``phony.''
   The reductions are not expected to be felt by many Americans, at
least initially.
   ``It affects a relatively small number of people in our society,
and affects them in a relatively small way,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said
last week.
   The automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts, when the law was enacted in
1985, were intended to seem so horrific that Congress and the
president would be frightened into cutting the federal deficit in
order to avoid them.
   It didn't quite work out this year.
   The law requires a projected deficit for fiscal 1990 _ which
began Oct. 1 _ of no more than $100 billion. If the projected
shortfall exceeds the target by more than $10 billion today, the
law automatically triggers cuts in spending of whatever is required
to slash the figure to $100 billion.
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget _ which makes
the projections _ estimated in August that the 1990 deficit would
be $116.2 billion.
   The cuts apply to all defense programs except for money already
owed because of signed contracts. That means that about $190
billion out of the budget's $300 billion for defense is subject to
reductions.
   Nearly 75 percent of domestic spending is exempt from the cuts
under a series of special rules written into the law. Programs not
subject to any cuts include Social Security, payments on the
national debt, other federal retirement and disability programs,
veterans' pensions and compensation, and state unemployment
benefits.
   A host of other domestic programs are vulnerable to only limited
cuts. Medicare, veterans' medical care, community and migrant
health centers and Indian health facilities cannot be cut by more
than 2 percent.
   Early on, agencies _ which receive their budgets in monthly or
quarterly allotments _ cope by delaying purchases, leaving vacant
jobs unfilled, reducing travel and shifting money within accounts.
   The law forbids officials to save money by cutting workers'
salaries. This covers virtually all government workers _ the
president, members of Congress, judges, civil servants _ with the
exception of congressional staff workers, whose pay is determined
by senators and representatives.
   Technically, the Gramm-Rudman cuts ``temporarily'' took effect
Oct. 1, and agencies have been watching their budgets since then.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in hectic, nervous European trading Monday, reflecting
tremors in the stock market.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders in London and Frankfurt said the dollar swung wildly as
it mirrored the sharp movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   ``The Dow has led the day,'' said one London dealer, who added
that the foreign exchange markets had become considerably calmer
toward the end of the day, with market participants beginning to
turn their attention to Tuesday's U.S. trade figures.
   ``It was a very nervous market today,'' said Ernst Pullmann,
chief trader at Deutsche-Girozentrale Deutsche Kommunalbank in
Frankfurt. ``First the Dow Jones was down 3 percent, and then it
was up 1 percent and the dollar followed right along. But it looks
like the dollar has decoupled itself from the stock market now.
Things are quieting down.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 3.25 yen to a closing 140.75 yen from
Friday's 144.00. Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate
of 141.10 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost

   President Bush, trying to reassure troubled
financial markets, said today he was not worried about the stock
market's plunge. The Federal Reserve backed up the reassuring words
with hard cash, injecting $2 billion into the U.S. financial system.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his first public comments about
the market gyrations since Friday's 190-point plunge, said the
central bank and government agencies were ``watching development in
financial markets rather closely.''
   ``We maintained particular surveillance overnight of Asian and
European markets and have kept in productive contact with our
counterparts abroad,'' Greenspan said in a speech to the American
Bankers Association.
   ``Coordination exists at a detailed level here in the United
States among the Federal Reserve, the SEC (Securities and Exchange
Commission), the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and
the Treasury Department,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York accounced that it was
pumping $2 billion into the banking system today. It accomplished
this by buying government securities from banks. The money provided
by the Fed to purchase the securities increased the amount of
reserves that banks have to make loans.
   The Fed had sent signals over the weekend that it would supply
as much liquidity as needed to the banking system in an effort to
contain the damage from the Friday the 13th stock market plunge.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which skidded
more than 49 points in the first 30 minutes of trading this
morning, sported a gain of 43.24 points at 2,612.09 by noon on Wall
Street.
   Bush was asked about the stock market today at a picture-taking
session in the White House. ``I'm not worried,'' he said.
   Addressing a reporter, the president said, ``You ask if I'm
worried. No. The Federal Reserve and the SEC (Securities and
Exchange Commission) and the secretary of the Treasury are
monitoring the situation and that's where it stands right now.''
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also was keeping
close tabs on the situation, mainly through Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   ``The president feels that the economy remains strong ... the
economic outlook continues to look good,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Bush would be alerted by Brady _ who attended the
morning senior staff meeting at the White House to discuss the
situation _ if the government needed to take any specific
market-calming steps.
   ``We wouldn't speculate'' on what steps might be taken, the
spokesman said. ``We'll continue to watch it (the markets). It's
pretty hard to tell what the market's going to do.''
   A senior Fed official, speaking on condition of anonymity
Sunday, said the central bank was prepared to flood the banking
system with money to prevent any further stock decline from
rippling out of control.
   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that is
needed,'' the official said in a telephone interview. ``If there
are any doubts about liquidity being available, there is no reason
to be concerned.''
   The term ``liquidity'' refers to the ready availability of cash.
   Developments in overseas marneeded cash to the banking systems in their
countries to stem any
fallout from the U.S. plunge.
   The world's central banks also were prepared to intervene if
necessary by buying dollars to keep the value of the U.S. currency
from falling precipitously, the official said.
   For the 6,500 bankers gathered for cocktails and conferences,
market events are reminiscent of the opening of the group's 1987
convention in Dallas when the market crashed 508 points, causing
Greenspan to abruptly cancel his speech and jet back to Washington.
   Greenspan was widely credited with decisive action that
prevented the 1987 crash from wreaking havoc on the banking system
and perhaps toppling the entire country into a recession.
   While the injection by the Fed of massive amounts of cash into
the system cannot by itself push stocks higher, it does serve to
reassure nervous bankers that they need not cut off credit to
securities firms suffering heavy losses.
   The brokerage houses, assured of a reliable line of credit, then
can refrain from selling stock simply to replace their dwindling
supplies of cash. Such waves of forced sales can drive prices down
even further.
   C.C. Hope, a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said the regulatory agency had asked banks to stand ready to
help if asked by the Fed.
   ``The banks are ready to participate. ... The Fed has lined up
the players,'' he said. ``We've just expressed our concern to some
people and said, `Stand by and be ready to do some assistance if
you're called upon.'''

<HEAD>Stock Market Widely Mixed in Extremely Heavy Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong selling knocked down a broad range of
stock prices today in the wake of the worst setback on Wall Street
since the crash of 1987 but blue chip shares bobbed up from an
earlier plunge.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which sank more than 49
points in the first 30 minutes of trading, sported a gain of 36.27
points at 2,605.53 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Trading volume was extremely heavy. Volume on the Big Board came
to 330.51 million shares with two hours left to go, which would be
an unusually hefty amount for an entire day.
   Losers maintained a wide lead over gainers on the Big Board,
with 1,202 down in price, 470 up and 252 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.47 to 187.03.
   Wall Street analysts were reluctant to speculate how the market
might fare during the remainder of the day, the first session since
the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.
   Markets overseas, which had closed by the time the New York
slide started Friday, reacted with moderate to large declines today.
   Stocks rocked back and forth in hectic U.S. trading. Substantial
price declines encouraged some buyers to go after bargains, which
helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average. Computer-driven
program trading intensified the price swings.
   AMR, owner of American Airlines, skidded 16~ to 81} after
investor Donald Trump announced he had withdrawn his $120-a-share
offer for the company.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 55{ to 224\. Word that
an employee-led group seeking to buy UAL for $6.75 billion had
failed to secure financing was cited as the direct cause of the
market's drop on Friday. The news cast doubts on all future
debt-financed corporate takeovers.
   Most components of the Dow Jones industrial average showed gains
in the afternoon. Gainers among the blue chips included American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1~ to 41|, USX, up 1 to 34, General
Electric, up 1\ to 55{ and Philip Morris, up 1} to 42}, which was
the most active Big Board issue.
   One blue chip loser was International Business Machines, which
today announced a 29.7 percent slump in third-quarter earnings. IBM
fell ~ to 101[.
   Besides worries about highly leveraged takeovers, market
strategists blamed a series of factors for sending the stock market
into a tailspin on Friday. Disappointing inflation and interest
rate prospects motivated sellers while program trading added to the
downward momentum.
   Friday's drop in the Dow Jones industrial average came to 6.91
percent of its value. It was the second biggest point drop in
history, exceeded only by the 508-point loss on Black Monday, Oct.
19, 1987.

<HEAD>Main Street America Buffered From Storms of Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The frenzied froth of Wall Street tapered off Monday to more of
a controlled simmer on Main Street, partly because small investors
prefer long-term strategies and have learned to ride out the
storms, market pros and investors said.
   ``People haven't been terribly spooked, despite the wild
gyrations in the market,'' said Tom Rosencrants, director of
research for Interstate-Johnson Lane in Atlanta.
   ``They're not panicking at this point. They are not jumping out
the windows,'' said Earl Silver, a senior vice president of Dean
Witter Inc. in Chicago.
   Jitters mounted over the weekend after a frantic sell-off in the
last 90 minutes of trading Friday plunged the Dow Jones industrial
average 190.58 points. The Friday the 13th swoon raised fears of a
repeat of 1987's Black Monday, when the Dow crashed a record 508
points.
   Out in the mainstream, the Monday mood was a mixture of calm and
concern.
   A heavyset man in casual dress watched the ticker at the Charles
Schwab &amp; Co. office in Pittsburgh with bemused calm. ``It's never
the end of the world,'' he said, declining to give his name.
   ``I go in for the long-term so I'm just going to hang in there.
I didn't panic or anything,'' said Leon Straub, 51, an unemployed
electronics technician in Appleton, Wis. ``I'm optimistic.''
   ``In a week, we'll have forgotten all about it,'' said Tom
O'Hara, executive director of the 132,000-member National
Association of Investors Corp. ``Fluctuation is part of life in the
stock market. The worst part is these things scare people out of
the market.''
   Only a fraction of Americans own or trade stock, so the impact
of a roiling market merely stirs worries about the economy in
general, according to Thomas Juster, professor of economics at the
University of Michigan.
   ``There almost certainly isn't any direct impact on the vast
bulk of Americans because they aren't in the stock market,'' Juster
said. ``But if there is a visible erosion in the economy, they turn
cautious. They avoid making commitments on purchases.''
   John Wright of Wright Investors Inc. in Bridgeport, Conn., said
35 to 40 percent of the publicly owned stock has been removed from
the market because of leveraged buyouts and takeovers in the past
five years.
   ``Mr. Main Street doesn't own much stock. He's a bystander in a
weak position. I don't think there was much individual reaction.
This was a battle of computers,'' Wright said.
   In today's market, most trading is done by computers, and is
done in multimillion-dollar transactions by trust departments,
foundations and institutions such as mutual and pension funds.
   And those who have sunk money into stocks have learned not be be
alarmed at market swings.
   ``The general public is a little more sophisticated than they
were two years ago,'' said Pat Campbell, senior vice president for
trading at The Ohio Company in Columbus, Ohio. ``There is no crisis
in confidence.''
   ``Why panic?'' said Joan Estep, 60, a retired pharmacist from
Burien, Wash. ``I've been through ups and downs before. You're
going to have gyrations. I'm not making any changes in my
portfolio.''
   Gene Armentrout, president of Gradison Financial Services in
Cincinnati, Ohio, sensed ``a certain amount of skittishness,'' but
his brokers were generally advising people to hold on rather than
sell.
   ``We're in this for the long haul,'' Armentrout said. ``We have
memories as to what happened to people who sold out at the bottom
of the crash in 1987. They didn't do so well.''

   Donald Trump scrapped his proposed $7 billion
offer for AMR Corp. Monday but said he was still considering making
a lower bid for the parent of American Airlines.
   It was the second unraveling of a giant airline deal since
Friday and came against a background of growing alarm over
debt-financed takeovers for large American companies.
   ``I am currently reviewing all my options with respect to AMR
including making another offer at a lower price,'' the New
York-based developer said in a letter to AMR Chairman Robert L.
Crandall.
   Trump said he was also considering increasing his holdings in
AMR or selling his stock. He said he would take ``any other actions
that I may deem appropriate.''
   AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it had no comment on
Trump's decision. The airline, which has said it wanted to remain
independent, had said it would study Trump's proposal but the
company made no other response to his overtures.
   Trump sent his letter after AMR's stock dropped $13.75 a share
to $84.87{ on the New York Stock Exchange Monday as volatile
trading on Wall Street continued following Friday's 190-point
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. Trump had offered to
buy AMR for $120 a share.
   Friday's stock plunge was caused in part by word that the
management-led employee group seeking to buy UAL Corp., the parent
of United Airlines, had been unable to secure financing for its
proposed $6.75 billion buyout of that airline.
   Blue chip issues made a comeback Monday, but the broader stock
market remained lower and trading was extremely heavy.
   AMR's stock was depressed amid the uncertain outlook for airline
takeovers. Trading in the airline's shares was temporarily halted
pending the announcement of Trump's withdrawal.
   Trump's proposed bid, announced Oct. 5 but never formally
presented to stockholders, had been shrouded in skepticism, partly
because of growing criticism over a rash of airline takeovers that
rely on borrowed money.
   The developer gave no details of his financing strategy besides
a plan to include $1 billion of equity in his proposed offer.
   Friday's stock drop had cast further doubt on the proposed deal.
   Trump's decision to withdraw his bid was similar to actions
taken by investors following the October 1987 stock market
collapse, when falling prices made pre-crash takeover offers too
expensive.
   At that time, for example, Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl
Icahn temporarily halted plans to take that company private and
Dart Group Corp. canceled its hostile takeover offer for the
retailer Dayton Hudson Corp.
   Earlier Monday, before Trump announced he was withdrawing his
AMR bid, union leaders and several congressmen criticized his
takeover proposal, saying it would saddle the nation's largest air
carrier with such a heavy debt it would be forced to sell assets
and cut corners on safety.
   Opponents of the bid testified before a House committee in
support of a bill that would give the Transportation Department up
to 50 days to block the takeover of at least 15 percent of the
voting stock of a major air carrier.
   The bill has strong backing in the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee, but Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of
Arkansas, the panel's ranking Republican, said the Bush
adminstration is likely to oppose it.

   The turmoil on Wall Street led mutual fund
customers to shift money from stocks into safer havens Monday, but
firms also reported that last week's plunge attracted some
bargain-hunting investors.
   ``We're seeing a lot of buying as well as selling,'' said Steven
Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore.
``Some people are moving their money (out of stock accounts), but
other people are looking at this as a good opportunity.''
   A mutual fund is a company that pools money from shareholders
and invests it in a group of securities.
   As opposed to an investor who might buy stock in one company
hoping for a quick profit, a mutual fund customer is ``buying a
diversified portfolio. They're buying for the long term,'' Norwitz
said.
   Fidelity Investments, the country's largest mutual fund company,
received about twice as many calls as normal since the stock market
plunged 190 points on Friday, said Lawrence Dwyer, a spokesman for
the Boston-based firm.
   But he said the phone volume was about half of what it was
during the October 1987 stock market crash.
   While many people were asking to redeem their investments in
stock funds, ``redemptions are running just about under a third of
what we ran into in the stock market crash,'' he said.
   Also, as the day progressed, Fidelity got an increasing number
of orders to buy into stock funds, he said.
   Dwyer noted that most people who redeem their stock investments
simply move their money into a more conservative investment fund,
such as a money market.
   ``They still have their money and want to invest it,'' he said.
``But they just want to put it in more conservative investments.''
   Fidelity polled its customers over the weekend, and 84 percent
said they were investing for the long term, Dwyer said.
   Mutual fund investors, in general, ``have a pretty good
understanding of what they're in _ they just don't leap,'' said
Betty Hart, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington organization that represents mutual funds.
   Hart said her agency surveyed mutual stock fund customers around
the country after the October 1987 crash, and found that only 4
percent withdrew their investments completely within the first six
weeks.
   At the end of August this year, total assets in mutual stock
funds stood at $242.1 billion, just below the $242.9 billion of
August 1987.
   ``We're probably going to see investors staying the course,''
said John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard Group, a mutual fund
company in Valley Forge, Pa.
   ``They've learned the lessons from '87,'' he said. ``If they
would have stayed put, it would have been better than switching
out.''
   Mutual fund companies said they had plenty of cash reserves to
handle stock redemption orders, and they would not be forced to
sell stock in order to shift money from the accounts.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Whether States May Use Federal Law to Break Up Mergers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, agreeing to hear a case
involving the $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta
supermarket chains, said Monday it would decide whether states and
possibly private citizens may use federal antitrust law to break up
corporate mergers.
   The justices agreed to hear arguments by California officials
seeking to scuttle the Lucky-Alpha Beta deal, which was placed on
hold by an order issued by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in August.
   Lucky, California's largest supermarket chain, and Alpha Beta,
the fourth largest, operate 550 stores between them.
   Alpha Beta's parent company, American Stores, acquired Lucky in
June 1988.
   American Stores said California customers would save more than
$50 million a year because of increased efficiency from the merger.
But the California attorney general's office said in a lawsuit last
year that a merger means less competition _ leading to $440 million
worth of higher prices each year.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles temporarily
blocked completion of the merger, ordering continued separate
operation of the chains even though the financial acquisition had
occurred.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling in March, saying in effect that California Attorney General
John Van de Kamp waited too long to sue.
   The appeals court said California officials, if they had moved
quickly enough, could prevent the merger. But the appeals court
said only the federal government, not states and private citizens,
has the power to break up mergers after financial arrangements are
completed.
   O'Connor's order in August had the effect of temporarily setting
aside the 9th Circuit court's ruling.
   In other actions Monday:
   _The court rejected an appeal by a right-to-work group that
sought to limit the power of unions to collect dues from
non-members. The court refused to hear arguments in an Illinois
case in which the group claimed it was treated unfairly by a
federal appeals court.
   _The justices refused to free Pan American World Airways from
having to pay $951,500 plus interest to two families of 1974 crash
victims.
   The court, without comment, left intact awards stemming from the
April 22, 1974, crash in Indonesia of a Pan Am plane flying from
Hong Kong to Los Angeles in which 96 passengers and 11 crew members
were killed.
   _The court decided not to consider whether the Internal Revenue

<HEAD>Receive $409 Million Bid for Most Holdings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.J. Hooker Corp., operating under bankruptcy
court protection, on Monday said it would carefully review a $409
million bid from a private investment group seeking to acquire most
of its holdings.
   The cash offer announced over the weekend covers L.J. Hooker's
three regional shopping malls, shopping centers, a large Atlanta
office building and undeveloped land in several states. It also
includes L.J. Hooker International Inc., a commercial real estate
brokerage.
   Excluded from the acquisition proposal are L.J. Hooker's
department store chains, B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller. The
company has said it is looking for buyers for B. Altman and expects
to retain Bonwit Teller.
   A spokesman for L.J. Hooker, David McAdam, said the company
wouldn't comment on the proposal until after reviewing it.
   ``It's something we will take under serious consideration,'' he
said Monday.
   The investment group making the bid is led by the Shidler Group
and the Simpson Organization Inc. The group was assembled by the
London-based investment banking company Hoare Govett, a subsidiary
of Security Pacific Corp.
   Shidler, based in Honolulu, specializes in commercial real
estate investment and says it has $1 billion in assets.
Atlanta-based Simpson is a development firm and its chief executive
A. Boyd Simpson was a senior Hooker officer from 1979 to 1988.
   ``This large cash infusion provides the opportunity for Hooker
to substantially repay its creditors without subjecting itself to a
protracted period of piecemeal sales of assets,'' Simpson said in a
news release.
   L.J. Hooker, which has headquarters in Atlanta, sought
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code on Aug. 9. Sanford C. Sigoloff, a corporate executive who
specializes in improving the business of troubled companies, is
steering L.J.Hooker through its reorganization.
   Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia owns L.J. Hooker. The parent
company is run by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
   The properties included in the Shidler-Simpson proposal include
the massive Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati, the Richland Fashion
Mall in Columbia, S.C. and the Thornton Town Center mall in
Thornton, Colo. The Columbia mall is expected to open on Nov. 15
while the Thornton mall opened last month.
   Among the other Hooker properties covered by the offer are a
20-story office tower in midtown Atlanta, scheduled for completion
by February, and vacant sites in Florida and Ohio plus other
shopping centers.

<HEAD>Relieved Grain Futures Gain On China Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders, relieved by the stock
market's apparent recovery, reacted to news that China wanted
400,000 tons of U.S. wheat.
   Wheat futures surged in response to the news but gains in the
corn and soybean markets were limited by selling linked to the
rapidly advancing harvest.
   Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
grain traders were pleased with the stock market's strong rebound
from a Friday's plunge of about 190 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   The Dow average was up nearly 50 points when the grain markets
closed at 1:15 p.m. Central time.
   ``If the stock market had collapsed today, it would have made
people gloomy and doomy down here and they would have been inclined
to sell the grains,'' Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2} cents to 5 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.10} a bushel; corn
futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.36 a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 2} cents higher with December at
$1.42} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4 cents higher with
November at $5.46 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Liquor Barn, the nation's largest
liquor retail chain which has been under federal bankruptcy court
protection for nearly a year, has been purchased for $40 million by
an investor group.
   The assets of Liquor Barn Northern California and Liquor Barn
Southern California were purchased by LBI Holdings, which plans to
operate the 68-outlet chain under the same name with new management.
   The closing of the $40 million cash deal, first revealed in late
August, was announced this past Friday.
   Safeway Stores sold Liquor Barn to Majestic Wine PLC of Britain
in 1987. In November 1988, Liquor Barn filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The sale to LBI had
been approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of California.
   A plan of reorganization will soon be submitted to creditors,
according to a Liquor Barn news release.
   ``As a result of our efforts over the past eleven months inside
Chapter 11, Liquor Barn has recaptured a significant portion of its
market share and is poised to continue that trend,'' said C. John
Thompson III, the outgoing president and chief executive officer.

<HEAD>Boeing, Machinists Set Talks Wednesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Boeing Co. workers welcomed news Monday
that contract talks with the company would resume Wednesday, but
wondered whether the aerospace giant would offer anything new.
   Boeing and the Machinists union were told a meeting would be
held in the offices of federal mediator Douglas Hammond at 1 p.m.
Wednesday, two weeks after 57,800 workers walked off the job.
   ``Both sides will be here and we'll play it by ear from then
on,'' said Hammond, of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service.
   Hammond said there was no particular reason for choosing
Wednesday to resume negotiations. It was ``just a matter of me
assessing the situation and deciding it was time to get them
back,'' he said.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr would say little beyond confirming
the new round of talks and that Boeing's chief negotiator, Larry
McKean, would be there.
   Asked whether Boeing had modified its contract proposal to the
Machinists, Carr said, ``I am not going to comment on anything
having to do with the proposal itself. Really, we just agreed to
meet.''
   Union spokesman Matt Bates said he didn't think Hammond had told
union officials of any specific reason for calling the parties back
together.
   ``Whether there was movement or not I really wouldn't know,''
Bates said. ``Our position is that you can't settle a dispute
without talking. ... We welcome a chance to see whether Boeing has
re-evaluated its position. At this point we don't know.''
   The 57,800 members of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers at Boeing struck Oct. 4 after
voting 85 percent against a new contract offer from the world's
largest commercial jet builder, which is enjoying its fifth
straight year of record-high orders.
   About 43,300 strikers are in the Seattle area; 12,000 in
Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and lesser numbers at a
half-dozen other locations.
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York, said he thinks both sides probably are feeling increasing
pressure, and that Hammond's call back to the table illustrates ``a
little bit of impatience with both sides not attempting to breach
the gap between the two.''
   Pressure would come not only from airlines concerned about
on-time deliveries of their planes and from striking workers
missing paychecks, but also from a variety of government agencies
worried about the inflationary effects of high wage demands, the
fallout from the strike on military contractors around the country,
and the effects on the nation's trade balance, in which expensive
Boeing airplanes play a significant role, Nisbet said.
   ``With the total lack of any visible indication that there's any
movement on either side, there's growing concern outside the
company,'' he said.
   The news of resumed negotiations came the same day that the
first round of full, face-to-face negotiations began between Boeing
and its second-largest union, which represents engineers and
technical workers mostly in the Seattle area.
   Dan Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, was in the talks and not
immediately for comment Monday. But he said earlier that talks
probably would be held sporadically as needed over the next three
weeks.
   The enineering union's contract expires Dec. 1, but no one
expects a strike by the unaffiliated group, which represents nearly
28,000 engineers, scientists, manual writers, draftsmen and other
technical workers. About 95 percent are in the Puget Sound area,
with the rest in Portland, Ore., and at scattered air bases in
California, Utah and Florida.
   Because of mail voting procedures, the soonest a second strike
could occur would be early January, Mahoney said.
   Boeing's three-year offer to the machinists included wage hikes
of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of
gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause
almost matching inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and
increases in some benefits.
   After nearly two weeks on picket lines, striking workers
continue to be in good spirits, Bates said Monday.
   ``They know better than anybody that you cannot even dream of
building airplanes without the people in there and their highly
specialized skills,'' he said. ``And until Boeing develops an offer
they know there are no airplanes that are going to be built.''

   The securities industry compares its
``circuit-breaker'' system of temporary market trading pauses with
traffic lights at an intersection.
   Like traffic lights, the circuit breakers are intended to help
calm wild markets by halting severe price declines and giving
traders and investors a chance to stop and check the financial
landscape before continuing.
   But critics argue that the system _ which takes effect
automatically when prices fall wildly _ is possibly
counterproductive and could worsen any downturn by causing a
traffic jam of people who want to sell but can't do so.
   ``The reality of it is ... it could really snowball and cause
more selling,'' said Jack Baker, who handles trading of large
blocks of stocks for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The circuit breakers essentially are temporary trading
restrictions and halts that are imposed during major price swings
on the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
stock index futures market.
   The system was deployed on those markets a year ago to help
restore investor confidence after the Oct. 19, 1987 crash saw the
Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 508 points.
   Institutional investors employing computerized trading
strategies often use stock-index futures traded on the Chicago
exchange to hedge against losses in the stock market. But that kind
of trading often can cause wild price swings on both markets, and
was blamed by many critics for worsening the 1987 crash.
   The securities industry and federal regulators felt more
coordination was needed between the equities and futures markets.
   Richard Torrenzano, spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange,
said that in a wild market the circuit breakers``can slow things
down and let everyone assess what is going on.''
   The system kicked in on the Merc last Friday, after stock index
futures tumbled in response to a plunge in stock prices that saw
the Dow Jones industrial average finish down 190.58 points.
   But on Monday, the circuit breakers barely figured in trading as
the Dow industrials shook off a sharp early decline and finished
well above Friday's close.
   Under the NYSE system, stock trading is halted for an hour if
the Dow falls 250 points from its previous close and for two hours
if it falls an additional 150 points for a total of 400 points in a
single day.
   One feature of the system was tripped early Monday when Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index futures contracts fell 5 points at the opening.
An opening 5 point drop in those contracts traded on the Chicago
Merc triggers a 10-minute period during which those contracts
cannot be traded at any lower price.
   A spokeswoman for the Merc, Julie Jacobs, said that on Monday
buyers surfaced within seconds at prices matching or higher than
the opening price and trading was never interrupted.
   On Friday, one Mercantile Exchange trading limit was imposed
shortly after 2 p.m. when S&amp;P futures contracts fell 12 points _ or
the equivalent of almost 100 points in the Dow industrials. The
price of those contracts was not allowed to fall for 30 minutes
although trading could continue at that price or higher. The next
pause was reached about 45 minutes later when the S&amp;P futures fell
30 points from the previous day's close. The circuit breaker
program calls for trading at that price or higher for an hour.
Since Friday's trading day was to end 30 minutes later, the pause
ended trading at any lower price for the day.
   Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical analysis at the
investment firm A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the
restrictions in the futures market ``didn't do any good
whatsoever.'' He noted the bulk of the Dow's decline of 190.58
points Friday came in the final hour of trading.
   Shearson's Baker said that while the futures markets limits were
in effect, sell orders simply backed up. ``People who can't go to
the futures markets are going to sell stocks,'' he said.

   Blue chip stocks bounded ahead in unusually
brisk trading today, recovering from the worst setback on Wall
Street since the crash of 1987, but share prices of many other
companies trailed behind.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, knocked down by a
powerful selling wave in the opening minutes of trading, rallied as
buyers flocked to the market to snap up bargains. Market analysts
said the 190-point plunge in the widely watched barometer on Friday
pushed many stocks to attractively low prices.
   The broader market failed to overcome the impact of an early
selloff, however, and losers still held a lead over gainers at the
closing bell.
   In morning trading, stocks seesawed up and down as substantial
price declines encouraged fresh buying but by midday the Dow Jones
industrial average was embarked on an upward course for good.
Computer-driven trading strategies intensified the early swings.
   Airline stocks bumped into more turbulence. Investor Donald
Trump announced he was withdrawing his $7 billion bid for AMR,
parent of American Airlines, after the company's stock slid more
than $13 a share. AMR was halted briefly for the news and skidded
21| to 76] after trading resumed.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 56} to 223. Word that an
employee-management group seeking to buy UAL for $6.75 billion had
failed to secure financing for the deal had been cited as the
direct cause of the market's drop on Friday. The news cast doubts
on all future debt-financed corporate takeovers.
   Most components of the Dow Jones industrial average finished
higher.
   Besides worries about highly leveraged takeovers, market
strategists blamed a series of factors for sending the stock market
into a tailspin on Friday. Disappointing inflation and interest
rate prospects motivated sellers while program trading added to the
downward momentum.
   Market strategists were reluctant to speculate about how stocks
will fare in the near future but they note that current economic
and business conditions bare few similarities to two years ago.

   Some clients had no desire to ride
on Monday's see-saw stock market, others thought it was an ideal
time to buy and one investor even threatened to sue because his
regular broker was out sick.
   As the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 60 points
in the first hour of trading, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. broker John
Rodstrom Jr. sank into his swivel chair in his Fort Lauderdale
office, juggled calls and tapped at his computer terminal for stock
quotes.
   A raspy voice from Wall Street barked out advice over a speaker.
   ``This is hand-holding time,'' said Rodstrom. ``Everyone gets so
worked up on days like this that part of my job is just getting
them to calm down.''
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged
190.58 points to 2,569.26, the second-largest drop behind the
508-point ``Black Monday'' crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Most analysts
said the $200 million drop was linked to an announcement that
financing was unavailable for a $6.75 billion buyout of United
Airlines' parent UAL Corp.
   But forecasts of another frantic sell-off Monday were
contradicted by mid-morning with a rally that brought the market
above the opening level.
   While other brokers raced to put in orders, Rodstrom held back.
His advice to clients: patience.
   ``This market is going to testing how high it can go and testing
how low it can go,'' said Rodstrom. ``There's definitely going to
be a new level come out of this correction. Figuring out where it
will be is the trick.
   ``There's a saying: `Don't fight the tape.' It's good advice
when things are this crazy.''
   By 10:15 a.m. EDT, the selling frenzy reached a crescendo. The
tick _ the number of stocks either up or down _ had reached minus
940. Rodstrom usually uses minus 800 as a signal to buy.
   He put in one order. Others were written out, but not executed.
   Rodstrom took another call. The client, a well-heeled investor
with a large stock portfolio, was nervous and wanted an update.
Everything was down.
   ``Just sit tight,'' he told the client. ``We're a long way away
from another Black Monday. I just don't see it.''
   Rodstrom noted that Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average was down 1.8
percent from Friday, much less than many analysts had feared, and
the early drop on the New York Stock Exchange was steady, not like
the free fall of Black Monday.
   The client decided not to sell. Rodstrom gave a quick thumbs up
sign as the market rally began.
   ``Everyone seems a bit smarter after the '87 crash,'' said
Rodstrom, 37, whose desk was littered with market performance
graphs and telephone message slips. ``There doesn't seem to be that
panic reaction to shifts in the market. We're more inclined to lay
back than jump in screaming to sell.''
   Other factors distinguishing the current market from October
1987 are declining interest rates and a healthy U.S. dollar.
   ``And you don't hear anyone blaming the deficit for this latest
drop,'' he said. ``There's the feeling Gramm-Rudman (the federal
deficit-reduction law) is working and the economy is going in the
right direction.''
   By early afternoon, with the Dow up more than 70 points,
Rodstrom was beginning to take orders from money managers for
fast-rising issues such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Eastman Kodak
Co. and General Electric Co.
   For individual investors, Rodstrom was touting utilities, whose
dividends would be more attractive if interest rates fall further.
   ``Back in the old days someone bought 100 shares of IBM and
stuck it in a safe-deposit box,'' said Rodstrom. ``That whole idea
is out the window. It's all oriented to the short-term money and
the immediate profit.
   ``For a company holding stocks in their pension fund for 20
years, this is just a hiccup. For someone who just got in the
market last year, this is a big event. It's all a matter of
perspective.''

   Share prices nosedived across Europe on Monday in
their first reaction to Wall Street's Friday the 13th plunge, but
finished above their lows on optimism that New York prices would
not collapse.
   Volatility and heavy volume helped disrupt trading in most
European financial centers. Severe price drops triggered trading
halts in some markets and computer problems in others, although
activity remained orderly in Madrid and in London, the Continent's
biggest stock exchange.
   ``We're not out of the woods yet, but at least we didn't
crash,'' said a dealer with a large British brokerage firm in
London.
   Declines in European stock indexes ranged from 3 percent to 13
percent lower on the day.
   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down
by more than 9 percent at one point as investor nervousness
increased near the opening of trading across the Atlantic on Wall
Street, but recovered to finish at its high of the day. The index
finished down 70.5 points, or 3.2 percent, from Friday at 2,163.40.
   Trading was extremely heavy. Volume in London came to a 959.3
million shares, more than double Friday's volume of 457.7 million.
   Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in their
steepest fall ever, with the German Stock Index plunging 12.8
percent in what one Frankfurt dealer called ``a blood bath.''
   But other German and some Norwegian traders reported that while
individual investors were dumping stocks, institutions were holding
back.
   Sharp price drops triggered European versions of ``circuit
breakers'' _ market procedures designed to calm roiled markets _
and prompted some authorities to step in to contain the damage.
   Price drops of 15 percent triggered trading suspensions in many
shares in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon.
   A deluge of sell orders caused computer problems in Brussels,
where there was little trading all session. Amsterdam also had
computer problems during its session.
   The Frankfurt exchange and others stayed open late to compensate
for the trading difficulties.
   ``Right now, with the dollar up and Wall Street up, it certainly
doesn't look like any crash,'' said a Zurich dealer.
   ``It's all Wall Street right now,'' an equities analyst with the
London investment firm James Capel and Co. said, adding that New
York's performance after the European markets closed would set
Tuesday's tone for Europe.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
plummeted 190 points on Friday, fell sharply after its opening
before bouncing higher and lower throughout the session. The
widely-followed market index finished up 88.12 points at 2,657.38.
   Friday's debacle in New York occurred after European centers had
closed for the weekend and European investors were not reassured by
a modest setback in Tokyo earlier Monday.
   Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, issued a
statement after a routine meeting with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, saying Monday's share price declines were ``not
surprising.''
   He blamed the largely American phenomenon of junk bonds _
low-rated securities used widely to help finance the U.S. corporate
takeover wave _ for the slide.
   Lawson also said, ``As the events of 1987 demonstrated, there is
no need for sharp fluctuations in the stock market to have
significant effects on the real economy.''
   A spokesman for the West German central bank, the Bundesbank,
said, ``We're observing the situation very intensively. We've been
in constant contact with the affected countries.'' He requested
anonymity.
   Madrid Stock Exchange President Pedro Guerrero said the main
challenge was to maintain liquidity at all costs, ``and this has
been achieved totally.'' He described trading as ``frenetic, but
satisfactory.''

   With a worldwide audience watching, the stock
market pulled off one of its favorite tricks Monday _ heading off
in a much different direction from where it was expected to go.
   After a worried weekend, government policymakers, business
managers and investors big and small arrived at work early, braced
for a possible re-enactment of the Crash of 1987.
   Instead, they witnessed a rally among many blue-chip stocks as
the market zigzagged erratically in a barrage of trading that left
analysts and statisticians who track its progress gasping to keep
up.
   ``This can't be right,'' said a brokerage-house economist at
midmorning, checking a quotation machine that showed a small gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average only moments after it had been
down some 60 points.
   But the numbers were correct. The widely recognized average of
30 big-name stocks had begun a rebound from its early drop, and
from the 190.58-point loss it suffered on Friday, to sport a gain
of 88.12 points to 2,657.38.
   Some broader gauges of stock price trends declined, testifying
that investors had not grown bold enough yet to chase
enthusiastically after the shares of smaller, lesser-known
companies.
   Still, it was clear that the market wasn't sticking to the
script of almost exactly two years ago, when it followed a Friday
afternoon selloff with a record 508-point drop on Black Monday,
Oct. 19, 1987.
   The strength in the blue chips seemed to support the assertions
of officials in Washington and Wall Street that Friday's
``massacre'' did not stem from any crisis in the outlook for the
economy, the dollar or interest rates.
   For the moment at least, the market's problems appeared to be
confined to a collapse of enthusiasm for debt-financed takeover
deals, intensified by word Friday afternoon that financing could
not be found for a planned buyout of the airline holding company
UAL Corp.
   In a separate deal, investor Donald Trump said Monday he was
withdrawing a bid for AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines.
   ``We had two days to reflect, and people became aware of the
sharp differences between now and 1987,'' said Hugh Johnson, an
analyst at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   Like voters listening to campaign promises, veteran investors
have learned to be leery of official statements designed to bolster
markets in trouble. In the dark days of 1929, for instance,
repeated assurances were issued that ``conditions are fundamentally
sound.''
   This time, however, the optimistic message evidently got
through, amplified by supportive comments from prominent advisers
at several brokerage firms.
   A good many Wall Streeters gave the Federal Reserve high marks
for its tactics over the weekend, making its presence felt subtly
without issuing any formal statements that might have been heard as
alarm bells.
   ``That was enough to stabilize the confidence of institutional
investors,'' Johnson said. ``They went down their lists of stocks
and found quite a few that looked cheap.''
   Another theory to explain the market's resilience had little to
do with the Fed or the business outlook.
   According to this view, professional traders and money managers
were acting on their memories of 1987, when those who bought stocks
at depressed levels in the midst of the crash were handsomely
rewarded by the market's subsequent revival.
   Monday's session, so it seemed, offered a second chance to play
this profitable game.
   Whether that kind of thinking pays off once more remains to be
seen. In the meantime, the activity in stocks Monday provided a
resounding affirmation of another principle, summarized two decades
ago by money manager George A. Chestnutt Jr.: ``The market always
does what it has to do to make the majority wrong.''

   The dollar finished mixed in hectic U.S. trading
on Monday, as a rebound in a widely followed U.S. stock market
index propelled it above its closing levels earlier in the day on
overseas markets.
   Gold prices finished higher. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted an after-hours bid for a troy ounce of gold at $365.80, up
$1 from Friday's late bid.
   Analysts credited a rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average
for the dollar's improved showing in domestic trading compared with
its closing levels overseas. Despite the improvement, the dollar
finished below Friday's New York closing levels against the West
German mark, Japanese yen and Swiss franc.
   The rise in blue-chip stock prices in New York following
Friday's huge selloff was viewed as taking some of the pressure off
the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates.
   ``The dollar seemed to be moving in lockstep with the stocks,''
said Jeffrey Mondschein, managing director for foreign exchange at
Continental Bank in Chicago.
   Falling U.S. interest rates would make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.
   The Dow Jones industrial average traded in plus territory for
most of the afternoon, and finished with a 88.12-point gain,
recovering about half of the 190.58 points lost on Friday.
   But Jack Barbanel of First Global Asset Management in Princeton,
N.J., said the fact that the dollar did not finish broadly higher
in the U.S. compared with Friday's closing levels here indicates
``a lack of confidence'' by foreign currency traders that the stock
market has fully recovered from Friday's loss.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to 140.75 yen from 144.00 yen on Friday.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 141.10 yen. In New York,
the dollar finished at 141.80 yen, but that was still down from
142.05 yen on Friday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which rose
to $1.5820 from $1.5625 late Friday. But the pound weakened against
the dollar in New York, falling to $1.5750 from $1.5820 on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late rates
Friday included: 1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.6340
Swiss francs, down from 1.6420; 6.3480 French francs, up from
6.34325; 1,374.50 Italian lire, up from 1,370.37; and 1.17675
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17385.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday,
included: 1.8650 West German marks, down from 1.9025; 1.6345 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6720; 6.3365 French francs, down from 6.34375;
2.0805 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1465; 1,372.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,396.50; 1.1765 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1750.
   In the gold markets, bullion advanced in New York and Europe
after falling in Hong Kong.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose
$4 a troy ounce to settle at $367.30.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $366.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $364.25. In Zurich, gold rose to
$367.00 an ounce from $363.70 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong,
gold fell 32 cents an ounce to close at a bid of $367.08 an ounce.
   Silver for immediate delivery rose 2.5 cents a troy ounce to
$5.104 on New York's Commodity Exchange. But silver fell earlier in
London to a late bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce from $5.12 on
Friday.

   The energy futures market ended lower Monday,
with moderate losses sustained in crude oil and refined petroleum
products.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
slid 30 cents to settle at $20.59 a 42-gallon barrel, after rising
42 cents on Friday.
   Other contract months also fell.

Merc, the November contract for wholesale home heating oil lost
0.45 cent to close at 60.42 cents a gallon. The contract had
declined 0.30 cent on Friday.
   November unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.58 cent in the previous
session, fell 0.30 cent to 55.85 cents a gallon.

   Blue chip stocks bounded ahead Monday in one of
the busiest trading sessions ever but share prices of many other
companies trailed behind.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, knocked down by a
powerful selling wave in the opening minutes of trading, rallied as
buyers flocked to the market to snap up bargains and helped Wall
Street avoid a repeat of the Black Monday crash two years ago.
   The barometer, comprising some of the country's best known
companies, surged 88.12 to 2,657.38. It was the fourth largest
point-gain in the history of the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Market analysts said the 190.58-point plunge in the widely
watched market measure on Friday pushed many stocks to attractively
low prices.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed shares by about 4 to 3,
with 975 stocks down in price, 749 up and 279 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 416.29 million
shares, the fourth heaviest total ever and the highest since Oct.
21, 1987 when 449.35 million shares changed hands. Volume Friday
was 251.17 million.
   Market regulators expressed satisfaction with the way exchanges
coped with the crush of business.
   ``All of the systems throughout the exchange have functioned
extremely well throughout the day,'' said NYSE spokesman Richard
Torrenzano.
   The NYSE had anticipated a flood of sell orders and opened its
computers at 7:30 a.m. EDT, an hour earlier than usual, so it could
sort out business before trading began two hours later.
   After the Black Monday crash the nation's stock and futures
markets installed safety measures intended to prevent a recurrence
of the panicky selling that triggered the 508-point plunge in the
Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 19, 1987. Several of the
safeguards were activated Monday.
   Governments around the globe were monitoring market activity and
reportedly keeping in touch in case any coordinated action was
needed to avert a crisis.
   The Federal Reserve Board took the precautionary step of pumping
$2 billion into the nation's financial system as a show of good
faith that it would try to ease any credit squeeze caused by heavy
stock sales.
   Airline stocks ran into more turbulence.
   Investor Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing his $7
billion bid for AMR, parent of American Airlines, after the
company's stock slid more than $13 a share. However, he said he
would consider lowering his offer. AMR was halted briefly for the
news and then tumbled 22[ to 76{ after trading resumed.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 56~ to 222~. Word that
an employee-management group seeking to buy UAL for $6.75 billion
had failed to secure financing was cited as the direct cause of the
market's drop on Friday. The news cast doubts on all future
debt-financed corporate takeovers.
   The Dow Jones average of 20 transportation stocks plummeted
102.06 to 1,304.23 due to the impact of the airline selloff.
   Many components of the Dow Jones industrial average sported
significant gains. Some of these included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up 3\ to 43, USX, up 1[ to 34[, General Electric, up 2\
to 56{ and Philip Morris, up 2\ to 43\, which was the most active
Big Board issue on turnover of nearly 8 million shares.
   Despite reporting a 29.7 slump in third-quarter earnings,
International Business Machines added 1 to 103.
   Besides worries about highly leveraged takeovers, market
strategists blamed a series of factors for sending the stock market
into a tailspin on Friday. Disappointing inflation and interest
rate prospects motivated sellers while program trading added to the
downward momentum.
   Market strategists were reluctant to speculate about how stocks
will fare in the near future but they note that current economic
and business conditions bare few similarities to those of two years
ago.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 467.39 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $58.64 billion, or 1.78
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
4.20 to 189.76.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index advanced 11.63 to 391.33, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished 9.23 points higher at
342.85.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
6.31 to 460.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 376.41, off 2.04.

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and PaineWebber Group Inc. reported Monday
their earnings declined in the third quarter, while another large
securities firm, Bear Stearns Cos. Inc., said its fiscal
first-quarter profit rose over a year ago.
   Meanwhile, Charles Schwab Corp., a San Francisco-based discount
brokerage firm, said it had a sharp earnings increase in the three
months ended Sept. 30. Merrill Lynch, based in New York, said net
income from continuing operations fell to $43.2 million, or 36
cents per share, from $56.1 million, or 49 cents, in 1988. Revenue
rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion.
   Bear Stearns, of New York, said first-quarter earnings totaled
$22.1 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with earnings of $20.5
million, or $20 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue rose
21 percent to $580.4 million from $478.9 million in 1988.
   PaineWebber, also of New York, said third-quarter earnings
totaled $16.83 million, or 41 cents per share, on revenue of
$444.87 million. That compared with earnings of $20.92 million, or
50 cents a share, in 1988.
   Merrill Lynch said the third-quarter results ``reflected an
industry-wide softness in some of our core business activities.''
   ``The lower volume of underwritng activity and principal
transactions were partially offset by revenue increases from
commissions and asset management fees,'' the company said in a
statement.
   For the first nine months of this year, Merrill Lynch said it
earned $144.4 million from continuing operations, or $1.23 a share,
compared with a profit of $164.1 million , or $1.45 a share, in
1988.
   Bear Stearns Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said he was pleased with
the first-quarter results ``because several of our departments ...
were operating in a very difficult environment.''
   He said the company saw a decline in principal transactions
during the quarter due to a drop in government bond trading
activities, among other things.
   PaineWebber said third quarter results included a broad-based
improvement in core businesses. It said the 1988 results included a
pretax gain of $46.3 million, and without that, the quarter would
have shown a loss.
   For the first nine months of 1989, PaineWebber's earnings
totaled $41.09 million, or 85 cents a share, on revenue of $1.27
billion. That compared with earnings of $41.84 million, or 77
cents, and $1.30 billion in revenue, during the same period last
year.
   Schwab said it earned $4.6 million, or 16 cents a share, in the
third quarter on $142.1 million in revenue. That was up from
earnings of $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, and revenue of $98
million.
   For the first three quarters, Schwab earnings rose to $12.8
million, or 46 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 25 cents.
Revenue totaled $185.6 million, up from $158.4 million.

   Stock-index futures prices surged in heavy
trading Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, erasing a lot of
investor fears and more than half of last Friday's dizzying losses.
   ``What we saw today was an avalanche of confidence,'' said
Morris Markovitz, president of Mercury Management Associates Inc.,
a commodities trading advisory firm based in New York.
   The contract for December delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 15.65 points higher at
344.50, the biggest-one-day gain ever. The contract is worth $500
per point.
   The contract opened at 323.85, five points below Friday's close,
triggering a ``circuit-breaker'' rule prohibiting further selling
at prices below that level for 10 minutes.
   But buying surfaced almost immediately, lifting the contract to
more than 8 points above Friday's close within an hour of the
opening.
   Traders and analysts attributed the rally to a resurgence of
investor confidence following Friday's 30-point plunge in the S&amp;P
500 futures, which corresponded to a 190-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   The Dow average rallied 88 points on Monday.
   Experts said Monday's supportive factors included the strength
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the main market barometer fell
by a modest 1.8 percent; the lack of high-volume computerized
strategies known as program trading, and the stated determination
of British Airways PLC to continue as a 15 percent partner in a
group seeking to buy United Airlines parent UAL Corp. The collapse
of the UAL deal contributed to the Friday selloff.
   Program trading involves the use of computers to buy and sell
huge blocks of stocks and index futures in an attempt to profit
from minute differences in prices on the two markets. The practice
can cause rapid price swings and is believed by some to have
accelerated the stock-market collapse of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Bill Finke, a vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago, speculated that program traders may have withdrawn from
the market intentionally.
   ``I would assume the firms that do program trading knew it was a
crucial day for people to have confidence in the market,'' he said.
   Stock-index futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of
stocks at specified prices by a specified date. Large institutional
investors use stock-index futures in various trading strategies
aimed at profiting from the difference between stock prices and
futures prices.
   Circuit breakers had halted trading in S&amp;P 500 futures twice on
Friday, for 30 minutes each time, as prices plunged.
   The halts were designed to slow the markets and prevent panic
selling.
   The circuit-breakers were installed last October as part of a
coordinated effort to prevent another stock-market crash like the
508-point plunge in the Dow average that occurred two years ago.
   The Chicago Board of Trade said Monday it had added a 20-point
opening limit to its Major Market Index contract, a stock-index
futures product that is not as heavily traded as the Merc's S&amp;P 500
contract.

   Stock-index futures prices soared Monday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, erasing some investor fears and more than half
of last Friday's losses while easing jitters on other commodity
markets.
   Also on Monday, copper futures fell sharply while precious
metals gained; grains and soybeans rallied; livestock and meat
futures retreated and energy futures sagged.
   The contract for December delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 15.65 points higher at
344.50 in heavy trading on the Merc. The contract is worth $500 per
point.
   ``What we saw today was an avalanche of confidence,'' said
Morris Markovitz, president of Mercury Management Associates Inc.,
a commodities trading advisory firm based in New York.
   Traders and analysts attributed the rally to a resurgence of
investor confidence following Friday's 30-point plunge in the S&amp;P
500 futures, which corresponded to a 190-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   The Dow rallied 88 points on Monday.
   Experts said Monday's supportive factors included the
encouraging performance of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the main
market barometer fell by a modest 1.8 percent; the stated
determination of British Airways PLC to continue as a 15 percent
partner in the group seeking to buy United Airlines; and a dearth
of program trading, which can sometimes cause rapid price swings.
   The Chicago Board of Trade said Monday it had added a 20-point
opening limit to its Major Market Index contract, a stock-index
futures product that is not as heavily traded as the Merc's S&amp;P 500
contract.
   Copper futures slumped to two-week lows on New York's Commodity
Exchange, partly on stock-market jitters and partly on a report
that a settlement of the 14-week-old strike at Canada's Highland
Valley copper mine was imminent.
   Officials of the mine, located in British Columbia, announced a
breakthrough in contract negotiations last week.
   The copper market, particularly vulnerable to industrial demand,
opened sharply lower on stock-market jitters, then recovered along
with stocks only to retreat in afternoon trading amid speculation
about the Canadian strike situation.
   On the bullish side, the London Metal Exchange said in a weekly
report that stocks of copper registered for delivery against its
futures contracts tumbled by 13,575 tons to 89,300 last week.
   Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 3.5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $1.2745 a pound.
   Precious-metals futures rallied on the Comex, partly reflecting
investor nervousness about the stock market.
   Precious metals are often perceived as a safe haven during times
of economic uncertainty.
   Gold and silver made intra-day highs before the stock market
opened but they remained firm, despite stocks' recovery, on
lingering doubts about the stock market, said Bette Raptopoulos, a
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $3.90 to $4.10 higher with October at $367.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 2.5 cents higher with December
at $5.163 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied on the Chicago Board of
Trade as traders, relieved by the stock market's recovery, reacted
to news that China was bidding for 400,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat and had purchased 150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures settled 2} cents to 5 cents higher with December
at $4.10} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2} cents higher with
December at $2.36\ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3 cents higher
with December at $1.42{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents
higher with November at $5.47 a bushel.
   Weak cash markets encouraged profit-taking in the livestock and
meat markets on the Chicago Merc, where live cattle futures settled
.15 cent to .78 cent lower with October at 73.35 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .60 cent to 1.13 cents lower with October at
82.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to the limit 1.5 cents
lower with October at 47.37 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.02 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 50.62 cents a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 22 cents to 30 cents lower with November at
$20.59 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .50 cent lower with
November at 60.42 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to
.71 cent lower with November at 55.85 cents a gallon.

   President Bush provided reassuring words
Monday in an effort to calm gyrating financial markets while the
Federal Reserve backed up the words with $2 billion in cash poured
into the U.S. banking system.
   The Fed's supply of cash was viewed as a sizable effort on the
part of the central bank to contain the Friday the 13th stock
market plunge and make sure it did not have disastrous ripple
effects through the rest of the economy.
   Private economists gave Fed officials high marks for their
handling of the matter, praising the speed with which the Fed
played a key role in helping to calm the market jitters.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after suffering a
190-point plunge Friday, rose 88.12 points on Monday in the fourth
heaviest trading day in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.
   Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said that the market's performance showed that the
markets and government regulators had learned lessons from the
market collapse two years ago when the Dow Jones average had
plummeted a record 508 points.
   ``Today's developments demonstrate the value of the significant
improvements that have been made in trading systems over the past
two years,'' Breeden said in a statement after the markets had
closed.
   Bush declared, ``I'm not worried,'' when asked by reporters
about Friday's market turmoil during a morning photo session at the
White House.
   The president stressed that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Reserve were keeping close tabs on developments.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan echoed that sentiment in
a speech before the American Bankers Association. Greenspan said
the Fed had also been in ``productive contact'' with foreign
governments.
   Greenspan did not elaborate on what actions the United States
and other governments were taking, but one hour after his address,
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that it had injected
$2 billion into the banking system.
   This sizable infusion of cash served to back up comments made by
a senior Fed official over the weekend that the central bank stood
ready to flood the banking system with money, if necessary, to
contain the damage from Friday's plunge.
   While an infusion of cash cannot by itself push stock prices
higher, it does serve to reassure nervous bankers that they need
not cut off credit to securities firms that may have suffered heavy
losses in a market dive.
   The brokerage houses, assured of a reliable line of credit, are
thus not forced to dump more stock to replenish their dwindling
supplies of cash. Such forced stock sales can drive prices down
even further.
   The Fed accomplished the $2 billion infusion of cash by buying
that amount of government securities from banks. The money provided
by the Fed to purchase the securities increased the amount of
reserves banks have to make loans.
   The process by which the Fed buys and sells government
securities from commercial banks is the principal method by which
the central bank controls the growth of the U.S. money supply.
   The $2 billion infusion of money was termed sizable by private
economists. They said it if had not been for the market turmoil,
the Fed more than likely would have been draining cash from the
banking system in an effort to keep interest rates steady.
   To mop up an excess supply of cash, the Fed reverses the
procedure and sells government securities to commercial banks. The
banks are then left with smaller reserves of cash on which to make
loans.
   Because of the Fed's efforts to expand the money supply, the
closely watched federal funds interest rate fell to 8.50 percent
Monday. That rate, at which banks make overnight loans to each
other, had been 8.82 percent last Thursday.
   The Fed's efforts to counteract the sudden loss of $200 billion
in stock values Friday had the effect of lowering interest rates,
something that the administration has been pressuring the central
bank to do for some time as a way of keeping the country out of a
recession next year.
   The Fed has been resisting those moves with Fed officials
contending that they were still concerned about inflationary
pressures in the economy.
   A Fed official stressed that the central bank could insure that
the short-term effects of the Fed's moves did not lead to
inflationary pressures by draining away any excess reserves once
the immediate crisis has passed.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said that the
Fed had to be very careful that its efforts to calm the stock
market turmoil did not lower interest rates so much that the U.S.
dollar came under heavy selling pressure.
   Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated investments
less attractive and, if pushed too far, could trigger more stock
market turmoil as foreign investors dumped their U.S. investments
in favor of higher returns in other countries.
   ``The Fed is conducting a tight-wire act,'' Sinai said. ``It
needs to do a little easing to soothe the markets but not too much
to damage the dollar.''
   While the dollar opened significantly lower in Tokyo trading, it
steadied later in the day.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with Security Pacific earnings; No pickupp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. said Monday it suffered a $1.8 billion
third-quarter loss, as expected, reflecting its decision to add $2
bilion to its reserve cushion against shaky Third World loans.
   The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30, amounted to $9.92
per share, compared with a profit of $233.6 million, or $1.25 a
share, during the same period a year ago.
   It was in line with projections made Sept. 21, when Morgan
announced it was adding $2 billion to its loan-loss reserve. Other
major banks took similar action and also suffered big third-quarter
losses.
   The addition brought to $3 billion Morgan's total reserves, or
100 percent of its estimated portfolio of medium- and long-term
debt to Third World countries _ the highest of any money-center
bank.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Morgan's net loss totaled
$1.4 billion, or $7.87 a share, compared with earnings of $744
million, or $4 per share, last year.
   Morgan said non-interest income rose by 12 percent to $414
million in the third quarter. However, quarterly non-interest
expenses also increased, to $496 million from $429 million.
   Net interest income fell to $254 million from $347 million,
while net interest expenses rose to $496 million from $429 million.
   Morgan is the parent of flagship Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of
New York, and the nation's third-largest banking company with
assets of around $100.4 billion.
   Security Pacific Corp., the nation's sixth-largest bank holding
company, said its quarterly profit rose 10 percent, with strong
results from California and the Northwest overcoming weakness in
Arizona commercial real estate.
   For the quarter ending Sept. 30, the parent of Security Pacific
Bank with operations throughout the West earned $185.1 million, or
$1.55 per share, compared with $167.9 million, or $1.47 per share,
for third-quarter 1988.

<HEAD>Perkin-Elmer Sells Telescope Optics Division to Hughes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perkin-Elmer Corp. announced Monday that
Hughes Aircraft Co. of California will buy the company's division
that helped build NASA's super-powerful Hubble telescope.
   The electro-optics technology division in Danbury, Conn., which
employs 800, will be sold as part of a restructuring announced in
April, Perkin-Elmer spokesman Edward Bloch said. Terms of the sale
were not disclosed.
   The division built the optical systems, or innards, of the
Hubble telescope, which is scheduled to be launched next year
aboard the space shuttle. The telescope will allow scientists to
look seven times deeper into space than earth-based telescopes.
   ``With land-based telescopes we can see a certain distance out
into space, but a lot of what we see is obscured by haze around the
earth,'' Bloch said. ``But when it's up 350 miles above the earth,
it will expand the volume by about 350 times from what we can see
on the ground.''
   Hughes is the nation's largest defense electronics company, with
75,000 employees and $7.4 billion in sales in 1988. The company
designs and produces electro-optical sensors, laser systems and
data processing systems for use in space and on land.
   ``The acquisition by Hughes will strengthen its position as a
leading supplier of electro-optical systems for scientific and
military applications,'' Malcolm R. Currie, Hughes' chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   The sale is the second this year in Perkin-Elmer's effort to
unload three of its divisions. Late last month, the Norwalk-based
company announced it was selling its German aerospace unit in
Ueberlingen, West Germany, to the Diehl Group for an undisclosed
price.
   Perkin-Elmer is also negotiating to sell its semiconductor
equipment unit, and hopes to negotiate a sale by the end of the
year, Bloch said.
   Perkin-Elmer is retaining its analytical instruments division,
which produces scientific instruments used in laboratories; and its
material sciences division, which involves the heat- and
wear-resistant coatings used on jet engines.
   The company said in April, when the restructuring was announced,
that it wanted to focus on instruments and materials technology to
provide more consistent growth and profits.

   Two of Japan's smaller automakers
formally entered the ranks of American transplants Monday when
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. dedicated its auto assembly plant.
   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which owns a 51 percent share in the
operation, will produce its Subaru Legacy sedans and station wagons
here, while Isuzu Motors Ltd., which owns 49 percent, will turn out
pickup trucks and sports utility vehicles.
   Some auto industry analysts have expressed doubts about SIA's
ability to compete with established transplants such as Honda and
Nissan, but neither that skepticism nor storm-threatening skies
diminished a celebrative mood.
   Gov. Evan Bayh headed the dignitaries at the ribbon-cutting.
   ``The dedication ceremony commemorates the cross-cultural
relationship between SIA's two parent companies and the citizens of
Indiana, Tippecanoe County and greater Lafayette,'' said SIA
President Tamon Yamamoto.
   The $550 million, 2.3 million-square-foot facility at the
intersection of Interstate 65 and Indiana 38 currently employs
1,000, including 60 Japanese managers and coordinators. Employment
is forecast to reach 1,700 by mid-1990 as SIA approaches full
production under its first phase, and eventually 3,200.
   Under the first phase, SIA said it should produce 60,000 Subaru
cars and 60,000 Isuzu trucks annually. Plans call for expanding
production to at least 200,000 vehicles and possibly 240,000
yearly, SIA officials have said. ``The SIA plant is the only
automobile assembly facility in the United States where two
completely different product lines are built under one roof using
the same workforce,'' Yamamoto said in prepared remarks.
   SIA received an $86 million incentive package that included $55
million in state funds, which Bayh had criticized as too generous
in his gubernatorial run a year ago. However, after his November
election, he and Lt. Gov. Frank O'Bannon visited SIA executives and
reaffirmed the state's commitment to the project.
   Impact studies project that the plant will generate $39 million
in local payroll dollars and more than $1 million in state taxes,
SIA said.
   ``We are proud of SIA's evolving role in the state's economy,''
Executive Vice President Masahara Masumitsu, the chief financial
officer, said at a news briefing.
   The plant is purchasing many of its parts in state, including
steel from Northwest Indiana, transmissions from Muncie, computers
from Kokomo and glass from Evansville.
   ``We consider SIA a partnership, a blending of peoples,''
Masumitsu said.
   The team-concept philosophy SIA executives espouse means the
United Auto Workers won't be welcome at SIA. Vice President James
Woroniecki, head of human resources, said SIA's starting pay for
production workers ranges from $11.60 to $13.05 per hour, with a
benefits package similar to those at other Japanese transplants.
Management personnel have the same benefit package as hourly
employees, he said.
   As for unions, Woroniecki said, ``We don't think they're
necessary.''
   Ninety percent of the employees hired locally come from within a
60-mile radius of Lafayette, and just 2 percent are from out of
state, Woroniecki said. One fifth of the workforce is female, and 7
percent are minorities, he said.
   SIA, as the smallest and latest of the Japanese transplants, may
face the most uncertain future, especially with the disappointing
sales of the Legacy, which was introduced earlier this year.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury bonds Monday returned most of
their gains from the year's biggest rally last week as investors
cashed in on a previous move to safer fixed-income investments.
   However, the $200 billion market for high-yield ``junk'' bonds,
which was partly blamed for Friday's stock-price rout, showed signs
of improving, with trading picking up from a near-standstill.
Prices were even to lower.
   Investment-grade corporate bonds rose slightly while municipal
bonds were unchanged to higher, traders said.
   And overseas, bond prices were mostly higher, reflecting a
decline in stock prices abroad.
   Most of Monday's slump in the U.S. market came from
profit-taking, particularly in Treasury bonds, following an
improvement in stock prices here, experts said.
   ``We're getting the flip side of Friday,'' said Maria Ramirez, a
managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Greater
opportunities (for profits) like this don't come that often.''
   Prices of some government bonds gained as much as $25 per $1,000
face value Friday and yields skidded to levels not seen in two
years following a 190.58-point tumble on the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   Concerns about corporate takeovers and the junk bonds that are
often used to finance them helped stoke the panicky selling in
stocks, as well as this year's biggest government bond rally.
   Fixed-income securities _ especially Treasury bonds _ benefited
from that turmoil since they're considered a safe haven for
investors.
   Stock prices turned mixed in volatile trading Monday, with
blue-chip stocks recovering but prices of many other companies
losing value. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 88.12
points to 2,657.38.
   Some bond traders said the fact that the stock market didn't
continue Friday's freefall helped keep a lid on bond prices.
   ``I think the profit-taking (in many bonds) was generated by the
fact that the stock market wasn't getting hit big again,'' said
Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.
   F. Ward McCarthy, a principal at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc., said the credit markets also were disappointed
that the Federal Reserve didn't provide more than the $2 billion in
funds it injected into the financial system.
   In late trading Monday in the secondary market for Treasury
bonds, the bellwether 30-year issue was off about 1} point, or
$17.50 per $1,000 face amount, after rising around $20 on Friday.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, jumped to 7.97
percent from 7.88 percent, the lowest level since early April 1987.
   Prices of short-term government issues fell between 9-16 point
and } point, intermediate maturities were down about a point and
long-term issues declined by about 1} point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, stood at 1,189.15, off 7.22.
   Meanwhile, yields on three-month Treasury bills soared to 7.72
percent as the discount rose 54 basis points to 7.49 percent.
Yields on six-month bills jumped to 7.89 percent as the discount
rose 25 basis points to 7.51 percent. Yields on one-year bills
increased to 7.84 percent as the discount rose 36 basis points to
7.34 percent.
   In corporate bond trading, highly rated issues gained some
ground. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which
measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.23 to 336.65.
   Junk bonds continued to decline, although many traders said
activity picked up significantly and some issues that had fallen as
much as $30 or $50 per $1,000 face value in Monday's opening, had
less severe losses at the close.
   ``I think you're seeing activity because people are saying at
these levels you can't afford not to buy,'' said Joan Greenberg, a
bond trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose to 93 5-32 from 92 26-32 Friday. The
average yield to maturity slipped to 7.35 percent from 7.41 percent.

   The Bush administration conferred closely with
foreign allies, the Federal Reserve Board and Wall Street officials
through the weekend in mapping a strategy for averting a ``Black
Monday'' crisis that, in the end, never developed, sources said.
   Within the first hour of trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Monday, President Bush pointedly told reporters, ``I'm not
worried.'' Behind the business-as-usual image, however, the sources
said, was a weekend of intentive private consultations intended to
forestall an escalation of Friday's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
   The average ended Monday up 88.12 points.
   Bush, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and SEC Chairman Richard Breeden sought
over the weekend to work together to avoid the kind of government
missteps that may have contributed to the October 1987 crash, said
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Their actions included making sure that officials' comments not
add to the markets' confusion, as was the case two years ago with
SEC comments suggesting the possiblity of a trading halt, said the
sources.
   After Monday's close, Breeden said, ``Today's developments
demonstrate the value of the significant improvements that have
been made in trading systems over the past two years.''
   Also after the close, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``We're pleased it stabilized. ... Things have worked out.''
   The strategy also called for close coordination with allied
governments whose own markets faced the possibility of disruptions
Monday and getting the word out that the Fed would pump money into
the nation's banking system to meet brokers' cash needs.
   Brady, who chaired the presidential commission that studied the
1987 crash and recommended ways of dealing with future market
plunges, was assigned the lead role for the administration over the
weekend, said Fitzwater.
   Bush, who spent the weekend in Camp David, Md., was given
updates Saturday and Sunday by Brady and Michael Boskin, the
chairman of the presidential Council of Economic Advisers,
Fitzwater said.
   A senior Treasury Department official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said there was ``constant communication'' over the
weekend among Brady, Wall Street, the Fed, the SEC and the White
House.
   In addition, ``we talked with officials'' in the United States'
six largest economic allies _ Britain, Japan, France, West Germany,
Canada and Italy _ in an effort to coordinate economic policies.
   ``We wanted to make sure we understood the situation in the
markets, including the currency markets. And then we kept a close
watch when the (overseas) markets began to open last night,'' the
Treasury official said.
   Wall Street and administration officials credited better
coordination among regulatory agencies and financial markets and
some of the so-called circuit-breaker mechanisms _ adopted on the
recommendation of the Brady commission _ with helping to prevent a
repeat of 1987's runaway Friday-Monday sell-offs.
   Under the game plan jointly put into effect by the Treasury, the
SEC and the Fed:
   _The Fed made clear over the weekend that it would move to pump
cash into the banking system should it be necessary. On Monday, it
did this to the tune of $2 billion, in the process providing easier
credit to banks for overnight loans.
   _While Treasury kept in constant touch with trading partners and
U.S. agencies, administration officials publicly stressed the
underlying health of the U.S. economy.
   _The SEC sent out teams to closely monitor activity on stock and
option exchanges, feeing the information back to headquarters.
   Brady also made an unusual appearance at the White House Monday
morning.
   In addition to meeting with President Bush, the Treasury
secretary sat in on the daily meeting of senior White House aides _
and, according to those present, urged that an upbeat face be put
on the situation.
   While there is a limit to what a president can do to influence
the stock market _ beyond rhetoric _ there is one drastic option he
has at his command: he can order a halt in trading.
   Fitzwater would not say whether such an option was even
considered, not wanting to advance any speculation that could make
things worse.
   In fact, it was a comment during the stock crash of 1987 by
then-SEC chairman David S. Ruder that ``anything was possible''
regarding a possible trading halt that Brady cited in his report on
the crash for driving stock prices down even further.

   Upjohn Co. said Monday its third quarter
earnings rose 7 percent on an 8 percent increase in revenue, helped
by strong sales of pharmaceuticals and animal-health products.
   Upjohn reported earnings of $96.0 million, or 52 cents a share,
for the three months ended Sept. 30, up from $89.6 million, or 49
cents a share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Revenue for the period totaled $715.3 million, up from $651.8
million a year earlier, the company said.
   For the first nine months of the year, Upjohn reported earnings
of $293.6 million, or $1.59 a share, on revenue of $2.21 billion,
up from $272.8 million, or $1.47 a share, on revenue of $2.04
billion in the first nine months of 1988.
   Upjohn said sales of health-care products and services were up 8
percent, led by increased U.S. sales of its Micronase oral drug for
diabetics and its Ansaid and Motrin IB anti-inflammatory products.
   A stronger dollar, pushing up prices of U.S. goods purchased
with foreign currencies, kept foreign pharmaceutical sales flat,
Upjohn said.
   The company said sales of agricultural products were up 18
percent worldwide, with increased demand for Naxcel antibiotic for
cattle and Lincomix feed additive contributing.
   Upjohn is a worldwide provider of human and animal health-care
products and services as well as seeds and specialty chemicals. It
had 1988 revenues of $2.75 billion.

   Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds totaled $528
million in September, up 2 percent from the same month a year ago,
the Treasury Department reported Monday.
   The September sales raised the total of bonds sold in fiscal
1989, which ended Sept. 30, to $7.72 billion, the most since 1987
and 6 percent above the total in 1988.
   The Treasury said Americans held a record $115.7 billion worth
of bonds at the end of September.
   The government raised the interest rate on bonds to 7.81 percent
from 7.35 last May 1. The current rate is effective through Oct. 31
when held five years or longer.

<HEAD>LIN Broadcasting Board Takes No Position on Latest McCaw Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp. said Monday its board
took no position on the latest buyout offer from McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. and requested more information about the
proposal.
   LIN also asked BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based regional
telephone company with whom it has reached a separate agreement to
merge cellular telelphone operations, what it thought of McCaw's
offer for control of LIN.
   Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw, the nation's largest cellular
telephone company, said last week it would offer $125 a share, or
$2.75 billion, for 22 million of LIN's 53.9 million shares.
   Together with the 5.1 million shares of LIN it already owns,
successful completion of the offer would give McCaw control of LIN
with slightly more than 50 percent of shares outstanding.
   Under the new offer, McCaw indicated it would either buy the
rest of the company's stock in five years or put the company up for
auction.
   The proposal replaced an earlier buyout offer under which McCaw
said it would pay $110 a share for the 90 percent of LIN that it
did not already own. That valued all of LIN at $5.9 billion.
   LIN, the New York-based cellular telephone giant which also
operates television stations and has a small publishing business,
rejected McCaw's earlier offer as inadequate and reached the deal
with BellSouth.
   In Monday's announcement, LIN said its board expects to take a
position on the McCaw offer before it expires, now scheduled for
Oct. 27.
   But LIN said its board wanted to know more about the offer,
including whether McCaw is prepared to guarantee that those shares
not covered by the new partial tender offer would have a value of
at least $125 a share.
   It also wanted an explanation of how McCaw can be sure other
bidders will be willing to pay an appropriate price for LIN if it
decides not to buy the rest of the company's shares in five years
and how it can be sure McCaw will not act in a manner in the next
five years that would diminish LIN's value.
   In its statement, LIN said BellSouth indicated that it would
respond to McCaw's proposal ``in as full and effective a manner as
is warranted'' and is ``carefuly reviewing alternatives.''

<HEAD>House-Senate Negotiators Agree to Airline Smoking Ban Compromise</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf, `The smoking ...,' to RESTORE dropped word ``billion.''

   House-Senate negotiators agreed Monday to ban
smoking on all continental U.S. airline routes and on all flights
to or from Alaska and Hawaii scheduled for six hours or less.
   The restrictions would permanently prohibit smoking on nearly
all scheduled flights within American territory. There are about
16,000 airline flights scheduled daily within the United States,
and one tobacco industry lobbyist said he believed the rule would
allow smoking on about 55 flights per day.
   But lobbyist Jo Ellen Deutsch of the Association of Flight
Attendants said she thought smoking would be permitted on fewer
than 20 flights per day.
   ``We've now gotten it down to the point where we have virtually
banned smoking on airplanes,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
one of the architects of the provision.
   Flights from the West Coast to Hawaii and Alaska are scheduled
for less than six hours and would be covered by the ban, Lautenberg
and others said.
   But smoking would be permitted on non-stop flights scheduled at
more than six hours to or from those states and points further East.
   The prohibition would also apply to flights to or from U.S.
possessions in the Caribbean, but not to and from Guam.
   Each leg of a non-stop flight counts as a separate flight under
the smoking ban. Thus a New York-Hawaii flight with a stop in San
Francisco would be non-smoking: the New York-San Francisco segment
would count as a domestic flight; the San Francisco-Hawaii segment
would be covered because it is scheduled for less than six hours.
   The scheduled time is what counts: Passengers could not light up
if the San Francisco-Hawaii leg is delayed in the air to take more
than six hours.
   Current law prohibits smoking on flights of two hours or less,
covering 80 percent of U.S. routes. Those restrictions are
scheduled to expire in April 1990.
   The new rules will take effect 95 days after they are signed
into law.
   The smoking provision is part of a bill appropriating $11.9
billion for transportation programs in the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1. The House and Senate members of the conference committee
still have to agree on other disputed provisions before the bill
can go back to the two chambers for approvial of the final version
to be sent to President Bush for signing into law.
   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who helped write the
prohibition, predicted the measure would be approved in their
chambers.
   ``The tobacco lobby will realize it could have been worse and
accept it,' Durbin said.
   Charlie Whitley, a consultant to the Tobacco Institute, the
trade group for cigarette manufacturers, said the industry was
happy that a permanent ban on all flights had been averted.
   ``As much as it preserves, we'll take that,'' he told a reporter
after the session.
   Whitley said cigarette makers hope that a Department of
Transportation study on airline cabin air quality, due out early
next year, will show that smoking is not the only problem with
cabin air, and will suggest ways to recycle it better.
   ``Cigarette smoke is a little like a canary in a coal mine,''
said Whitley, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina.
``You can see it and smell it, when there are all these other
things in the air, too.''
   Health advocates and leaders of airline unions, who have argued
that tobacco smoke in a confined aircraft cabin is unhealthy for
non-smokers, were elated.
   ``I'm feeling very good,'' said M. Arnita Hannon, lobbyist for
the American Lung Association. ``Essentially, we've covered 99
percent of the flights.''
   The provision was a compromise between the Senate, which sought
a permanent ban on all U.S. flights, and the House, which preferred
making permanent the current two-hour restrictions.
   During talks that lasted several hours, Lautenberg initially
said he would insist that if House negotiators did not adopt the
Senate language, he would force the House to vote on his proposal.
He said he would believed he would have prevailed on the House
floor.
   But after House Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., and several
others objected, Lautenberg accepted the compromise, which was
offered by Rep. Martin Sabo, D-Minn.
   ``I just felt it was a long, a very, very long time for people
not to be smoking,'' Sabo said of the flights lasting more than six
hours.
   The House voted 259-169 on Aug. 2 to make permanent the current
ban on smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. That
prohibition, which covers four-fifths of all domestic flights, has
been in effect since April 1988.
   On Sept. 14, the Senate voted 77-21 to end delaying tactics by
tobacco-state lawmakers who were trying to block a permanent
extension of that ban to all flights. The chamber then adopted the
stricter rules on a voice vote.

<HEAD>McClatchy Newspapers Report Earnings Up 21 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McClatchy Newspapers reported Monday a
21.5 percent increase in net income for its third quarter compared
to the same period last year.
   It said third-quarter profit reached $8.8 million, 31 cents a
share, compared with $7.2 million, or 25 cents a share, in the
third quarter of 1988.
   McClatchy said revenue grew 7.5 percent during the third quarter
to $94.9 million compared with $88.3 million during the same period
of 1988.
   Advertising revenue grew 7.2 percent to $75.3 million in the
third quarter, and circulation revenue jumped 9.2 percent to $16
million.
   Third-quarter operating income rose 14.5 percent to $13.8
million from last year's $12.1 million.
   The company cited as major contributors to the increase in
quarterly operating income the improved margins at the Tacoma News
Tribune and the Anchorage Daily News, and continued favorable
newsprint prices.
   McClatchy announced last month an agreement to buy three
dailies, four weeklies and a monthly from The News and Observer
Publishing Co. of Raleigh, N.C., for $74.1 million.
   Sacramento-based McClatchy publishes 13 newspapers, including
six dailies, in California, Washington and Alaska.
