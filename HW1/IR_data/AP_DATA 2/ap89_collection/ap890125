<HEAD>Bundy Wanted Cremation, Ashes Spread Over Cascades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a will signed the night before his
execution, Ted Bundy asked that his body be cremated and the ashes
spread over Washington state's Cascade Mountains, where at least
four of his victims' bodies were found, a newspaper reported.
   The will prepared by Bundy's civil attorney, Diana Weiner, was
released by Florida State Prison officials Wednesday at the request
of The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, which reported the story
in Thursday's editions.
   ``Diana A. Weiner will contact family and friends as to any
services. The ashes are to be spread over the Washington Cascade
Mountains,'' Bundy stated in the will.
   The will did not give a specific location for the ashes, and
attempts by The Associated Press to reach Ms. Weiner by telephone
were unsuccessful.
   Sandy Williams, co-owner of the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home in
Gainesville where Bundy's body was sent, would not give details
about the final disposition of the body because of an agreement with
Ms. Weiner.
   ``There will be no public funeral as of right now,'' Williams
said. ``We do not believe there will be a public funeral in the
future.''
   Bundy was executed Tuesday at Florida State Prison near Starke
for the February 1978 murder of Kimberly Leach, 12, of Lake City. He
also was convicted of two other Florida deaths and is suspected in
at least 50 deaths nationwide.
   He was suspected in as many as 15 rapes and murders of young
women in Washington while he lived in the Seattle area in the
mid-1970s. Four of his victims' bodies were found on Taylor Mountain
in the foothills of the Cascades.
   In the typewritten will, Bundy gave Ms. Weiner control over his
remains, personal property and assets, including mail sent to him at
the prison.
   Prison records show Bundy's personal property included a radio
with a headphone, a gold-tone chain with a cross, a religious book,
stationery, a gold wedding band and a bottle of suntan lotion.
   He also had $709.66 in cash, money donated by family and friends
for snacks and other items from the prison canteen.
   The items were inventoried Tuesday and picked up at the prison by
Ms. Weiner, said Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   Volusia County State Attorney John Tanner, a friend of Bundy's
who visited him often in recent years, was designated to handle the
arrangements if Ms. Weiner was unable to do so.

<HEAD>Figures for Recovering Steel Industry</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Heartland-Steel Town Revival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the
American Iron and Steel Institute. They represent reports from 25
companies representing 80 percent of the industry.
   _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post
a 1988 profit of about $2 billion. In 1987, profits were $1.02
billion, following losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86.
   The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in
the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand.
   _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have
risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in
1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase.
   _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons
in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase.
   _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000,
slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the
institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a
record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953.
   _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5
percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9
percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the
year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing
imports to 20.2 percent of the U.S. market. The agreement expires
this year.
   _ State Production: Indiana leads the nation in steel production,
with about 22 percent of the steel made there. Ohio accounts for 18
percent and Pennsylvania 13 percent.

<TEXT>
   A psychiatric nurse who turned to writing as a
hobby won the Whitbread Book of the Year award for his first novel
``The Comforts of Madness.''
   Paul Sayer, 33, received the $34,000 prize on Tuesday from an
11-judge panel for his harrowing story about long-term psychiatric
hospital patients who cannot speak.
   The novelist works with elderly patients at a hospital in North
Yorkshire and his tale has been likened to Ken Kesey's ``One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' about inmates of a U.S. psychiatric
institution.
   The total prize money of $46,750 makes the Whitbread Britain's
richest literary award.
   Sayer and four other writers had earlier won $2,550 each for
being selected as finalists for the Whitbread in five categories,
first novel, best novel, poetry, biography and children's novel.

   A Van Dyke self-portrait seems to be looking
down his nose at his unlikely surroundings in a little-known museum
tucked away in an old house in this rural south Louisiana town, not
too far from grazing cows.
   ``A lot of people come in here with (a puzzled) expression,''
said Delores Spears, director of the Zigler Museum. ``They want to
know how all of this got to the middle of nowhere.''
   The Van Dyke is in good company, just down the wall from a
Rembrandt, a Whistler, a Sir Joshua Reynolds and dozens of other
works by noted artists dating from the 17th century.
   Just off Interstate 10, 40 miles from the southeast Texas border,
Jennings was the home of Fred and Ruth Zigler, who had a fortune and
no heirs. They decided to leave a legacy to the area they loved.
   Zigler's father had moved from the landlocked Dakotas at the turn
of the century and made millions in shipbuilding, real estate, oil
and gas and other interests.
   The Zigler legacy included a museum foundation and a separate
foundation which grants full college scholarships each year to
deserving students _ one from each high school in the area. That
foundation also provides grants to charitable organizations,
including the museum foundation, which has a smaller endowment.
   Since 1960 when Fred Zigler died, the education foundation has
granted $1 million in scholarships. Grants to other organizations
total $3.5 million.
   ``That's really an economic boost when you take into account what
has happened in this parish,'' said Richard Boisture, a member of
the museum foundation. The parish, once fat and sassy from oil, gas
and shipbuilding, fell on hard times in 1980 with the decline of the
oil patch. Unemployment is over 13 percent.
   ``The money helps the kids, the community and all I can say is
thank God for the Ziglers,'' said Boisture.
   Before she died in 1974, Mrs. Zigler left the old family home to
the museum foundation. Two wings have been added to the two-story
columned mansion to handle the growing collection, which now totals
more than 150 pieces of art.
   Thanks to the education foundation, the museum was able to
purchase the Van Dyke in 1984 for about $125,000.
   ``We took it out of the crate and it was almost an emotional
thing,'' said Boisture. ``His hair looks like you could touch it and
feel the softness. He looks like he's almost glancing back with
disdain at someone.''
   One of the best buys, said Spears, was ``Morning'' by Helen
Turner, which cost relatively little years ago ``but it's in six
figures now. We've loaned it to a New York museum.''
   Spears says her favorites are a shoreline canvass by George
Inness and ``The Little Mother,'' painted by Charles Sprague Pearce
in the 1880s.
   ``A lot of school kids tour through here and if just one in each
group leaves with an interest in what he's seen, this museum is a
success,'' said Boisture. ``Middle of nowhere or not.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Anton R. Valukas' four years as U.S. attorney,
he has presided over an office that has indicted more than 270
public officials, government employees and others on corruption
charges.
   Valukas, 45, is again in the spotlight for his role in the recent
market-fraud investigation of the leading U.S. commodities exchanges.
   Observers say no one in Chicago is better prepared to tackle it.
   U.S. law enforcement officials are investigating allegations that
as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers
out of millions of dollars on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
the Chicago Board of Trade. No indictments have been announced and
Valukas has declined comment.
   Valukas has a vast knowledge of commodities trading, but it
wasn't built solely as a prosecutor.
   He learned much by defending traders.
   As a private attorney at the Chicago law firm Jenner &amp; Block,
Valukas represented brokers in criminal cases and in disciplinary
proceedings before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
agency that oversees futures trading.
   Eugene Wedoff, a U.S. bankruptcy judge who worked with Valukas at
Jenner &amp; Block, recalled at least one instance in which Valukas
successfully defended a Board of Trade broker accused of breaking
commodities laws.
   ``By the time he left Jenner &amp; Block, he probably knew a much
about commodities law as anyone in the city,'' Wedoff said.
   Chicago attorney John Troelstrup agreed Tuesday. ``When he came
to the U.S. attorney's office, Valukas was probably one of the most
knowledgeable and experienced ... in terms of commodities
experience,'' said Troelstrup, who is representing at least one of
those subpoenaed in the commodities probe.
   When Valukas, a Chicago native whose father was a judge, was
named U.S. attorney for the northern district of Illinois in May
1985, he pledged to make prosecuting white-collar corruption a
priority.
   ``Corruption is an epidemic-proportion problem in Chicago,''
Valukas said. ``It would be hard for me to imagine a city in which
there was more corruption.''
   He joined the U.S. attorney's office as an assistant prosecutor
in 1970. He joined Jenner &amp; Block in 1977 but returned to public
service in 1981 when Gov. James R. Thompson appointed him to head
the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority.
   Valukas served as an attorney on Thompson's re-election campaign
in 1982, and in 1985, the governor lobbied heavily to make him U.S.
attorney.
   Tactics used in the commodities probe _ ``wired'' FBI agents
posing as traders in the exchanges' trading pits secretly taping
alleged wrongdoing _ are familiar to Valukas.
   His office has orchestrated elaborate sting operations with
undercover agents paying off crooked police officers, judges and
politicians, and taping it all on hidden recorders.
   When he succeeded U.S. Attorney Dan Webb in 1985, Valukas took
over one of the most publicized investigations, Operation Greylord,
a probe of corruption in the Cook County court system.
   A key player in the probe was a southern Illinois judge brought
to Chicago. The judge hid a tape recorder in his cowboy boot and a
microphone in his judicial robes to document wrongdoing.
   So far, 90 judges, lawyers and other court employees have been
indicted in the Greylord probe and 70 have been convicted. Several
cases are pending.
   Operation Incubator, developed by Valukas and his assistants,
uncovered influence-peddling at Chicago's City Hall. The key figure
was FBI ``mole'' Michael Raymond, whom the FBI taped making payoffs
to politicians in Chicago and New York. Several former officials
charged in the probe are scheduled to go on trial in May.
   Valukas is rumored to be planning to leave the U.S. attorney's
office in the next few months. The Chicago Tribune reported Monday
that he's eyeing a partner's position at a major Chicago law firm.
   But Valukas has not publicly disclosed his plans.

<TEXT>
   In a rundown West Texas bar called the Sundowner
Recreational Club, dreams go down as easy as a cold bottle of Pearl
Beer and are just as intoxicating.
   They are the stuff of life for many of the characters in ``The
Night Hank Williams Died,'' Larry King's pungent yet poignant tale
of lost loves, missed opportunities, unfulfilled expectations and
fatal mistakes.
   It's not a perfect play, but until it collapses into violent
melodrama in Act 2, ``The Night Hank Williams Died'' has enough
low-key charm and homespun humor to soften the hardest of hearts.
   Maybe that's because King, author of ``The Best Little Whorehouse
in Texas,'' has a jaundiced affection for the folks he has put on
stage. It's love but love tempered by the knowledge that most of
these people will never amount to very much.
   Despite its title, the play has nothing to do with the death of
country-western star Hank Williams, although it is set in 1952 and
Williams' music wails from the bar's jukebox.
   Its main concern is Thurmond Stottle, a one-time high school
football hero in the tiny town of Stanley, Texas. Thurmond's
gridiron glories were nearly a decade ago. Now he's ``27 and working
on a beer gut'' while he pumps gas at the local service station.
   Between customers, Thurmond aspires to be another Hank Williams
or at least a songwriter who'll sell his compositions _ which have
titles like ``Little Bitty Bit of Love'' _ to Nashville stars like
Eddy Arnold.
   ``Nothin' wrong with dreams, providin' you act on 'em,'' counsels
Gus, the benevolent barkeep who extends Thurmond's beer tab as he
tries to rein in the boy's fantasies.
   Thurmond is galvanized by the arrival of Nellie Bess Powers, his
high school sweetheart. Her marriage to an up-and-coming
chiropractor has soured and she has come home ``to think about it.''
Her return rekindles Thurmond's adoration as well as his ambition to
make something of himself.
   King takes his time churning up the plot, but the wait has its
diversions. His dialogue is peppered with down-home conversation,
salty, sly and occasionally very funny give-and-take that is one of
the evening's main pleasures.
   Most of these lines are the property of actor Barton Heyman who
plays Gus, the bulky and blustery bartender. It's the play's most
fully realized role. By the time the curtain falls, Heyman has
revealed the frayed and forlorn humanity behind his coarse Texas
humor.
   Matt Mulhern has a harder time playing Thurmond who, when you get
down to it, isn't a very likable fellow. Mulhern also has a sweet,
pleasing singing voice, something at odds with his doltish,
one-track personality that smacks of loser from the very beginning.
At first, Betsy Aidem comes on as too much of a dust-caked Scarlett
O'Hara, but the caricature fades when she realizes the consequences
of her new fling with Thurmond.
   Strains show in the play when events turn melodramatic,
particularly with the appearance of Nellie Bess' fanatically devout
mother who still is ``keepin' in real close touch with Jesus.''
   Also painted in more black than white is the local sheriff, but
actor Steve Rankin does an expert job shading in the character with
a portrayal that's part good ol' boy and part smarmy Eddie Haskell
of television's ``Leave It to Beaver.''
   The direction by Christopher Ashley meanders through the play's
talkier moments and then seems frantic during its action-packed
finale. Still, Ashley allows time for the audience to savor the
people who inhabit designer Edward T. Gianfrancesco's wonderfully
ramshackled bar _ complete with deer head above the door.
   ``The Night Hank Williams Died'' is a bittersweet song to lives
and loves lost, spiced with enough laughs to soften the hurt.
Definitely worth a look.

   A teen-age worker in the undersea Channel Tunnel
project was crushed to death by a train in the first fatal accident
reported during the tunnel's construction, police said.
   They said the worker, who was not identified, was hit by the
train carrying a load of chalk from the tunnel face one-half mile
from the entrance at the port town of Dover on Monday night.
   The government-appointed Health and Safety Executive said it sent
inspectors to investigate the accident.
   The proposed 34-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it under water, consists
of two one-way rail tunnels and a smaller service tunnel between
them.
   It is being bored simultaneously from England and France under
the English Channel at a cost of $8.8 billion. Digging began in
December 1987.
   The tunnel is scheduled to open in May 1993 and would cut the
London-Paris train and ferry journey from about nine hours to three.

   Here is a transcript of executed killer Ted
Bundy's interview with religious broadcaster Dr. James Dobson of
Pomona, Calif. The interview, taped Monday afternoon, was released
to the news media Tuesday afternoon after Bundy was put to death in
Florida's electric chair.
   Dobson: You are scheduled to be executed tomorrow morning at 7
o'clock if you don't receive another stay. What is going through
your mind? What thoughts have you had these last few days?
   Bundy: I won't kid you to say that it's something I feel I have
control of, or something I have come to terms with, because I
haven't. It's a moment-to-moment thing. Sometimes I feel very
tranquil and other times I don't feel tranquil at all.
   What's going through my mind right now is to use the minutes and
hours I have left as fruitfully as possible and see what happens. It
helps to live in the moment in the essence that we use it
productively. Right now I am feeling calm and in large part because
I am here with you.
   Dobson: For the record, you are guilty of killing many women and
girls. Is that correct?
   Bundy: Yes, that's correct.
   Dobson: Ted, how did it happen? Take me back. What are the
antecedents of the behavior that we've seen? So much grief, so much
sorrow, so much pain for so many people? Where did it start, how did
this moment come about?
   Bundy: That's the question of the hour and one that not only
people much more intelligent than I will be working on for years but
one that I've been working on for years and trying to understand. Is
there enough time to explain it all, I don't know. I think I
understand it though, what happened to me to the extent that I can
see how certain feelings and ideas have developed in me to the point
that I began act to out certain very violent and very destructive
feelings.

abused, you were not emotionally abused.
   Bundy: No. No. And that's part of the tragedy of this whole
situation. Because I grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated
and loving parents, as one of five brothers and sisters, a home
where we as children were the focus of my parents' lives, where we
regularly attended church, two Christian parents who did not drink,
they did not smoke, there was no gambling, no physical abuse, not
fighting in the home.
   I'm not saying this was `Leave It To Beaver.' I don't know that
such a home exists, but it was a fine, solid Christian home and
nobody, I hope no one will try to take the easy way and try to blame
or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because I
know, and I am trying to tell you as honestly as I know how what
happened.
   This is the message I want to get across, that as a young boy,
and I mean a boy of 12 or 13 certainly, that I encountered, outside
the home again, in the local grocery store, in a local drug store,
the soft-core pornography that people called soft core. As I think
as I explained to you last night Dr. Dobson in an anecdote, as young
boys do, we explored the back roads and sideways and byways of our
neighborhood and often times people would dump the garbage and
whatever they were putting out of their house. And from time to time
we would come across pornographic books of a harder nature than, of
a more graphic, explicit nature than we would encounter at the local
grocery store. And this also inclouded such things as detective
magazines.
   Dobson: Those that involved violence?
   Bundy: Yes, yes, and this is something I think I want to
emphasize is that the most-damaging kinds of pornography, and again
I'm talking from personal experience, ... are those that involve
violence and sexual violence. Because the wedding of those two
forces is, as I know only too well, brings out the hatred that is
just, just too terrible to describe.
   Dobson: Now, walk me through that, what was going on in your mind
at that time?
   Bundy: Before we go any further, I think it's important to me
that people believe what I am saying. I tell you that I am not
blaming pornography. I am not saying that it caused me to go out and
do certain things. And I take full responsibility for whatever I
have done, and all the things I have done. That's not the question
here.
   The question and the issue is how this kind of literature
contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior
...
   Dobson: It fueled your fantasies, didn't it?
   Bundy: In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process,
then at a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say
crystalizing, making into something which is almost like a separate
entity inside. At that point, I was at the verge of acting out in
this kind ...

   Dobson: Now, I really want to understand that. You had gone about
as far as you could in your own fantasy life with printed material,
or printed and film ... and then there was the urge to take that
little step, or big step over to a physical event?
   Bundy: And it happened in stages, gradually. It didn't
necessarily, not to me at least, happen overnight. My experience
with pornography generally, but with pornography that deals on a
violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it, and
I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction,
I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic
kinds of material.
   Like an addiction, you keep craving something that is harder,
harder, something which, which gives you a greater sense of
excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes
so far, you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder
if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just
reading it or looking at it.
   Dobson: How long did you stay at that point before you actually
assaulted someone?
   Bundy: Well, yeah. That is a very delicate point, by the way in
my own development. We're talking about something ... about having
reached the point or gray area that, that surrounded that point over
a course of years.
   I would say a couple of years. What I was dealing with there was
very strong inhibitions against criminal behavior or violent
behavior that had been conditioned into me, bred into me in my
environment, in my neighborhood, in my church, in my school, things
that said, `No, this is wrong. Even to think of it is wrong, but
certainly to do it is wrong.' I'm on that edge, I would say the last
vestiges of restraint, the barriers to actually doing something are
being tested constantly, assailed through the kind of fantasy life
that was fueled largely by pornography.
   Dobson: Do you remember what pushed you over that edge? Do you
remember the decision to go for it, do you remember you decided to
throw caution to the wind?
   Bundy: When you say pushed, I know what you're saying. I don't
want to infer again that I was some helpless kind of victim in that
we're talking about an influence that is an influence of violent
types of media, violent types of pornography which had an
indispensible in the chain ... of events that led to the behavior
... the assaults, the murders.
   It's a very difficult thing to describe, the sensation of
reaching that point where I knew that, that something had say
snapped, that I knew that I couldn't control anymore, that the
barriers I had ... learned as a child, had been instilled in me,
were not enough to hold me back in respect to seeking out and
harming somebody.
   Dobson: Would it be accurate to call that a frenzy, a sexual
frenzy?
   Bundy: Yes, that's one way to describe it, a compulsion ... a
building up of this destructive energy. Another factor here I
haven't mentioned is the use of alcohol. What alcohol did in
conjuction with exposure to pornography is alcohol reduced my
inhibitions at the same time the fantasy life that was fueld by
pornography eroded them further.
   Dobson: In the early days, you were nearly always about half
drunk when you did these things, is that right?
   Bundy: Yes.
   Dobson: Was that always true?
   Bundy: I would say that that was generally the case.
   Dobson: All right, if I can understand it, there is this battle
going on within, there are the conventions that you have been
taught, there's the right and wrong that you learned as a child, and
then there is this unbridled passion fueled by your plunge into
hard-core, violent pornography and those things are at war with each
other? And then with the alchol diminishing the inhibitions, you let
go?
   Bundy: Yes, and it's accurate. It just occurred to me that some
people will say that `Well, I've seen that stuff and it doesn't do
anything to me.' And I can understand that. Virtually everyone can
be exposed to pornography and while they are aroused to one degree
or another, they do not go out and do anything wrong.
   Dobson: Addictions are like that. They affect some people more
than they affect others. But there is a percentage of people
affected by hard-core pornography in a very violent way and you are
obviously one of them.

   Bundy: That was a major component and I don't know why I was
vulnerable to it, all I know is that it had an impact on me that was
just so central to the development of the violent behavior that I
had reached. ...
   Dobson: Ted, after you committed your first murder, what was the
emotional effect on you? What happened in the days after that?
   Bundy: (long pause) Please understand, that even all these years
later it is very difficult to talk about and reliving through
talking about it is difficult, to say the least, but I want you to
understand what happened. It was like coming out of some kind of
horrible trance or dream. I can only liken it to after, I don't want
to overdramatize it, but to having been possessed by something so
awful and so alien, then the next morning wake up from it, remember
what happened and realize that basically, I mean in the eyes of the
law and certainly in the eyes of God, you were responsible; to wake
up in the morning and realize what I had done and with a clear mind
and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that
moment, absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something
...
   Dobson: You really hadn't known that before?
   Bundy: There is just absolutely no way to describe first the
brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once
it has been more or less satisfied and recedes, you might say, or
spent, that energy level recedes and basically I became myself again.
   I want people to understand this too, and I'm not saying this
gratuitously because it's important that you understand this. But
basically, I was a normal person, I wasn't some guy hanging out at
bars, or a bum. I wasn't a pevert in the sense that people look at
somebody and say I know there is something wrong with him, you can
just tell. I was essentially a normal person. I had good friends, I
led a normal life, except for this one, small but very potent and
very destructive segment of it that I kept vey secret and close to
myself and didn't let anyone know about. And part of the shock and
horror to my dear friends and family years ago when I was first
arrested was there was no clue. They looked at me and they looked at
the All-American boy. I wasn't perfect, ... but I was OK. I was. The
basic humanity and the basic spirit that God gave me was intact, but
unfortunately became overwhelmed at times.
   And people need to recognize it's not some kind of ... those of
us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the
media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of
inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we
grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and
snatch a kid out of any house today. It snatched me out of my home
20, 30 years ago and as dedicated as my parents were, and they were
diligent in protecting their children and as good a Christian home
as we had, and we had a wonderful Christian home, there is no
protection against the kind of influences that are loose in society
that tolerates. ...

   Dobson: You feel this really deeply don't you? Ted, outside these
walls, right now, there are several hundred reporters who wanted to
talk to you and you asked me to come here from California because
you had something to say. This hour that we have together, is not
just an interview with a man who is scheduled to die tomorrow
morning. I am here and you are here because of this message that you
are talking about here. You really feel that hard-core pornography
and the doorway to it, soft-core pornography, is doing untold damage
to other people and causing other women to be abused and killed the
way you did others?
   Bundy: Listen. I'm no social scientist and I haven't done a
survey, I mean I don't pretend that I know what John Q. Citizen
knows about this, but I have lived in prison for a long time now,
and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like
me. And without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in
pornography, without question; without exception, deeply influenced
and consumed by an addiction. There's no question about it. The
FBI's own study on serial homicide shows that the most-common
interest among serial killers is pornography.
   Dobson: That's true. Ted, what would your life have been like
without that influence? You can only speculate.
   Bundy: (tears) Far better not just for me, and excuse me for
being so self-centered here, but it would have been a lot better for
me and lots of other people and lots of other innocent people,
victims and families, it would have been a lot better. There's no
question there would have been a fuller life, certainly a life that
would not have involved, I am absolutely certain, a life that would
not have involved this kind of violence.
   Dobson: I'm sure Ted, if I were able to ask the questions that
are being asked out there, one of the most important as you come
down to your final hours: Are you thinking about those victims out
there and their families who are so wounded and years later their
lives have not returned to normal and will not return to normal?
They will never return to normal. Are you carrying that load, that
weight. Is there remorse there?
   Bundy: Again, people will accuse me of being self-serving, but I
am just telling you how I feel. Through God's help, I have been able
to come to the point where I much too late, but better late than
never, feel the hurt and the pain that I am responsible for. Yes,
absolutely. In the past few days myself and a number of
investigators have been talking about a number of unsolved cases,
murders that I was involved in.
   It's hard to talk about all these years later because it revives
in me all those terrible feelings and thoughts that I have
steadfastly and diligently dealt with and I think successfully, and
yet its reopened that and I felt the pain and I felt the horror and
I can only hope that those who I have caused so much grief, even if
they don't believe my expression of sorrow, will believe what I am
saying now; that there is loose in the towns and their communities
people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day
in, day out by violence in the media in various forms, particularly
sexual violence. And what scares me and it's coming to the present
now because what I am talking about happened 30, 20, 30 years ago in
my formative state. And what scares me, Dr. Dobson, when I see
what's on cable TV, some of the movies and some of the violence in
the movies that comes into homes today, the stuff that they wouldn't
show in X-rated adult theaters 30 years ago ...
   Dobson: The slasher movies is what you're talking about ...
   Bundy: That stuff is, I'm telling you from personal experience,
is the most graphic violence on screen, particularly as it gets into
the home to children who are unattended or unaware that they may be
a Ted Bundy who has that vulnerability, that predisposition to be
influenced by that kind of behavior. ...
   There are kids out there switching the TV dial around and come
upon these movies late at night, or I don't know when they are on,
but they're on and any kid can watch them. It's scary when I think
what would have happened to me if I had seen them, and it's scary
enough, I just ran into stuff outside the home.
   But to know that children are watching that kind of thing today
or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it.

   Dobson: Can you help me understand this desensitization process
that took place? What was going on in your mind?
   Bundy: About the desensitization, I would describe it in specific
terms is that each time I'd harm someone, each time I would kill
someone, there would be an enormous amount, especially at first, an
enormous amount of horror, guilt, remorse afterward, but then the
impulse to do it again would come back even stronger. Now, believe
me, I didn't ... The unique thing about how this worked, Dr. Dobson,
is I still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and
remorse about other things.
   Dobson: But you had this compartmentalized.
   Bundy: This comparmentalized, very well focused, very sharply
focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and
everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared. Does
that make sense?
   Dobson: Yeah, it does. One of the final murders that you
committed, of course, was apparently little Kimberly Leach, 12 years
of age. I think the public outcry was greater there because an
innocent child was taken from a playground. What did you feel after
that? Was there normal emotions three days later? Where were you,
Ted?
   Bundy: I can't really talk about that.
   Dobson: That's too painful.
   Bundy: I would like to be able to convey what that experience is
like, but I can't be able to talk about it.
   Dobson: OK. ...
   Bundy: I can't begin to understand, I can try, but I'm aware that
I can't begin to understand the pain the parents of these children
... (inaudible) feel, and I can't restore really much to them, if
anything and I won't pretend to. And I don't even expect them to
forgive me and I am not asking for it. That kind of forgiveness is
of God. If they have it, they have it. If they don't maybe they'll
find it someday.
   Dobson: Do you deserve the punishment the state is inflicted upon
you?
   Bundy: That's a very good question and I'll answer it very
honestly. I don't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. I kid you
not. I deserve, certainly the most extreme punihsment society has
and I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others
like me, that's for sure. I think what I hope will come of our
discussion is I think society deserves to be protected from itself.
Because as we've been talking there are forces loose in this
country, particularly again this kind of violent pornography where
on the one hand well-meaning decent people will condemn the behavior
of a Ted Bundy while they're walking past a magazine rack full of
the very kinds of things that send kids down the road to be a Ted
Bundy.
   We're talking here not just about more, what I'm talking about is
going beyond retribution, which is what people want with me; going
beyond retribution and punishment because there is no way in the
world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children
to their parents and correct and soothe the pain but I'll tell you
there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country
today who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the
next day and the next month because other young people are reading
the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are
available when the media took over.
   Dobson: Ted, as you would imagine there is tremendous cynicism
about you on the outside and I suppose for good reason. I'm not sure
there is anything that you could say that people would believe, some
people would believe.
   Bundy: Yeah.
   Dobson: And yet you told me last night, and I have heard this
through our mutual friend (State Attorney) John Tanner, that you
have accepted the forgiveness of Jesus Christ, and are a follower
and believer in him. Do you draw strength from that in these final
hours?
   Bundy: I do. I can't say that ... being in the valley of shadow
of death is something that I've become all accustomed to and that I
am strong and there is nothing bothering me. Listen, it is no fun.
It gets kind of lonely, and yet I have to remind myself that every
one of us will go through this some day in one or another and
countless millions who have walked this Earth before us have. So,
this is just an experience which we all share, and here I am.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece's new commissioner in the European
Economic Community is Vasso Papandreou, a former Socialist radical
who once wanted Greece out of the organization.
   She and Christiane Shrivener, 63, of France are the first women
to serve on the 17-member EEC Commission, which is made up of senior
executives and now is charged with preparing for the removal of all
remaining trade barriers within the 12-nation community by the end
of 1992.
   The 44-year-old Ms. Papandreou, a close friend of but not related
to Greece's Socialist premier, Andreas Papandreou, was appointed by
Jacques Delors, the Commission's president. As with all other
commissioners she is expected to act independently of her country in
shaping EEC policy. She has been assigned the community's taxation
and customs union portfolio.
   ``The Commission recognizes that social affairs have been left
behind,'' she said in an interview. ``There is a lot of work to be
done and success depends both on Commission policy and my activity.''
   A farmers's daughter from southern Greece, Ms. Papandreou studied
economics at Athens Higher School of Commercial and Economic Studies
and then earned a Ph.D. at Reading University in England.
   She belonged to a generation of young leftists who bitterly
opposed the 1967-74 military dictatorship in Greece and who were
inspired by Andreas Papandreou's radical socialist policies,
including pledges to take Greece out of the EEC and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But after leading his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) to
power in 1981, Papandreou decided it would be too costly to take
Greece out of the EEC.
   As one of the trade bloc's poorer members, Greece receives more
than $1.5 billion a year in benefits. Premier Papandreou and the
government are now enthusiastically pro-European.
   Asked how she reconciles her radical and Marxist past with her
new job, the tall, dark-haired Ms. Papandreou said: ``It's not me
that's changed but PASOK.''
   As deputy industry minister while Greece held the EEC presidency
during the second half of 1988, Ms. Papandreou chaired meetings on
streamlining industrial legislation in the community.
   In the male-dominated world of Greek politics, Ms. Papandreou and
Culture Minister Melina Mercouri, the former actress who starred in
``Never on Sunday,'' have proved the only female high-fliers in the
Socialist government.
   In her first government post as director of the Organization for
Small and Medium-Size Businesses for two years from 1981, Ms.
Papandreou often was assailed by conservative businessmen, who
accused her of trying to impose Marxist policies.
   But her two-year stint as deputy commerce minister after winning
a Parliament seat in 1985 impressed even those critics.
   Ms. Papandreou's portfolio on the EEC Commission will be a
sensitive one.
   Socialist EEC member-governments, currently in the majority, will
be seeking to expand labor laws and increase social security
payments.
   But the conservative governments are likely to oppose more social
welfare legislation that might further complicate the 1992 goal of
moving services, goods and money freely around the community.
   Ms. Papandreou says that during her years in government she has
learned the art of compromise, crucial in building community policy.
   ``One always has to compromise,'' she said. ``But I'm taking a
positive view and this will be a challenge and a great experience.''
   ``She is very intelligent, a very good diplomat and knows how to
maneuver,'' said Christos Papoutsis, a Socialist member of the
European Parliament who has known Ms. Papandreou for 15 years.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charges that West German companies
helped Libya build what may be a poison gas plant recall horrors
from two world wars and images of what a politician called the
``evil, self-deceiving German.''
   Germany shocked the world in World War I by wiping out 5,000
Allied soldiers April 22, 1915, with chlorine gas, introducing the
era of chemical warfare. The Nazis later use Zyklon B gas to kill
millions of prisoners, most of them Jews, at the Auschwitz death
camp.
   In addition to lessons of the past, the current debate dwells on
moral standards in a nation that has developed an arms export
industry in the last 15 years that ranks fifth in the world.
   ``German profits have grown much more quickly than ethical
standards,'' said the Rev. Friedhelm Hengsbach, a social sciences
professor at St. Georgen theological university in Frankfurt.
   ``The Germans are very smart in the sense of economic realities,
but they're not that shrewd when it comes to ethical responsibility
and political realities,'' the 51-year-old Jesuit priest said in an
interview.
   Norbert Gansel, a member of Parliament for the opposition Social
Democrats, put the problem succinctly: ``Now, our history has caught
up with us again. The evil, self-deceiving German is back.''
   In its current issue, the left-leaning magazine Der Spiegel said
the attitude of West German industry is ``export at all costs'' to
guarantee prosperity at home and ``tens of thousands of people pay
for the exporters' prosperity with their lives.''
   ``First comes the food, and then morals?'' it said, referring to
a line by the German author Bertolt Brecht. ``Not even that: many
deals are made completely without morals.''
   Government statistics say West German companies legally sell
about $16.6 billion worth of guns, submarines, munitions and other
arms overseas each year. That puts the country in fifth place behind
the United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   Several state and local investigations are under way to determan
the amount of arms and arms-related goods sent abroad illegally.
   Included are inquiries into reports of West German involvement in
Iraqi poison gas production in addition to allegations that West
German companies helped build the plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli,
that Libya says makes medicines and the United States says is for
producing chemical weapons.
   Iraq acknowledged using poison gas during its war with Iran, in
which a cease-fire was reached in August, and has been accused of
using it on minority Kurds.
   Reports arise frequently of West German companies evading export
restrictions, as Gansel reminded a noisy parliamentary debate on the
Libyan matter last week.
   ``The string of arms-export scandals is long,'' he declared,
including sales of sensitive nuclear technology to Pakistan, India
and South Africa.
   Gansel, 48, said Zyklon B gas killed ``countless defenseless
Jews'' and reminded fellow legislators the image of the ``evil,
self-deceiving German'' had become a theme for both newspaper
cartoons and editorials.
   Many newspaper stories, magazine articles and TV programs about
the chemical plant scandal point out the German history of poison
gas dating to World War I.
   Der Spiegel called poison gas part of the ``horrifying tradition
of the German chemical industry'' and said, after describing the
1915 attack at Flanders:
   ``When the fog lifted, 5,000 Allied soldiers were dead and 10,000
seriously injured. The German Army had launched chemical warfare.''
   In Munich, the Suedeutsche Zeitung reminded readers in an
editorial Jan. 13: ``Not everyone may like the Germans; no one has
forgotten their past. Whoever has as much power as the Federal
Republic must also bear responsibility.''
   Joachim Perels, a political science teacher at Hanover
University, said in an interview: ``It is a question of current-day
morality and the Nazi past. You just can't lose sight of that second
point. It would be better if West Germany didn't supply Libya with
any materials that could be used for war.''
   Friedrich Justus Perels, the professor's father, was executed by
the Nazis along with thousands of others for alleged involvement in
the unsuccessful attempt to kill Adolf Hitler in 1944.
   Michel Friedman, spokesman for Frankfurt's Jewish community, said
of the Libyan scandal: ``German companies should be more conscious
of what's taking place in Libya,'' an enemy of Israel. ``It's part
of the special responsibility of the Germans, and a special
responsibility isn't just something to pray about on Sundays.''
   Andreas Hillgruber, a conservative historian on the University of
Cologne faculty, said attempts to link the scandal with the Nazi era
are an example ``of the past that won't go away.''
   ``You can view everything that the Germans do today against that
background,'' Hillgruber said.
   Hillgruber and other conservative historians have tried to
compare the extermination of 6 million Jews with other atrocities to
show the Nazi genocide does not stand alone in history.

<HEAD>Death Toll in London Crash Rises to 35</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from the collision of three trains
near a busy south London junction six weeks ago has risen to 35 with
the death of a 61-year-old man.
   Alan Philipson, a passenger aboard a London-bound commuter train
traveling from his hometown of Bournemouth in southern England, died
of his injuries at a London hospital on Tuesday, the hospital said.
   Rail officials said the train Philipson was aboard slammed into
the rear of another passenger train that had stopped for a
malfunctioning signal about 400 yards south of Clapham Junction on
Dec. 12.
   A freight train traveling in the opposite direction then plowed
into spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had
scrambled onto the tracks, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A group of Vietnam Veterans has created a series of
advertisements narrated by Walter Cronkite and designed to focus
attention on the estimated 80,000 homeless veterans on America's
streets.
   The announcements for the Vietnam Veterans Workshop are shot in
grainy black and white film using professional actors who are all
Vietnam combat veterans, said Ken Smith, president of the workshop.
   The spots were unveiled Tuesday and will be broadcast on
television and radio and shown in movie theaters.
   The ads ask viewers to offer a pledge or volunteer to help the
workshop, which hopes to provide counseling or outreach centers for
homeless veterans.
   ``Two and a half million Americans went to Vietnam,'' it says.
``All any of them ever wanted was to come home. For 80,000, home has
become the streets, home has become a cardboard box, an abandoned
car.''

<HEAD>Trek to Reunify Eskimo Cultures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet-American dog sledding team announced
plans Tuesday to symbolically break the ice between Siberian and
Alaskan Eskimos during a 1,200-mile goodwill trek that will include
the first sanctioned crossing of the Bering Strait since 1948.
   Ten men and two women, comprising six Soviets and six Americans,
plan to depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two-month journey
visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route.
   The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region,
expedition co-leader Paul Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis, said at a
news conference at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan.
   ``Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,''
Schurke said, so it could be a very emotional experience.
   Because visitors are rare in villages so close to the top of the
world, he predicted that the expedition would be met with
``spontaneous celebrations and jamborees'' and that schools would be
let out so that the children could ski along with the team for a
while.
   A veteran of Arctic travel who made an unassisted trek to the
North Pole in 1986, Schurke said the journey was ``an opportunity to
combine my interest in travel in the north with playing a part in
the process of improving Soviet-American relations.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Soviet co-leader Dmitry Shparo,
47, of Moscow, praised Du Pont Co., the major American corporate
sponsor of the Bering Bridge Expedition. Shparo also put in a plug
for the main Soviet sponsors, Pravda's youth newspaper, the tourist
bureau known as Sputnik and Novosti, a news agency.
   Although he is a mathematics professor at Moscow's Institute of
Steel and Alloys, Shparo is best known as a writer and adventurer.
In 1979, he won the Soviet Union's highest honor, the Order of
Lenin, for successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole.
Last year, he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the
polar ice cap from the USSR to Canada.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also attended the news
conference, called the Bering Bridge Expedition ``another step
toward melting the ice curtain.''
   Murkowski noted that the U.S. government is working on a new
treaty with the Soviets that would permit American Eskimos to visit
and trade with their counterparts in Siberia without visas.
   In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that regularized
travel in the Bering region, but that agreement was abrogated in
1948 during the iciest days of the Cold War.
   In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border
around April 1.

   The hooded executioner who electrocuted Ted
Bundy was a civilian who received $150, a chauffeured escort to and
from the prison and a guarantee of anonymity.
   The executioner was chosen from a list the state has been using
since it advertised for executioners in 1976, when the death penalty
was reinstated.
   ``If we didn't take precautions, there are enough crackpots
inside and outside this prison that'd be threatening them,'' said
Thomas Burton, superintendent of Florida State Prison. ``They
threaten me every day.''
   Only Burton knows who's on the list. He is also the only person
who handles the arrangements.
   Jon Peck, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez, said he didn't know
the identity of Bundy's executioner but added it could have been a
woman, which was speculated by some witnesses to Bundy's execution.
   Bundy, who confessed to killing more than 20 women, was put to
death in the electric chair Tuesday for raping and murdering a
12-year-old girl.
   While security is paramount for the executioner's job, skill is
incidental.
   ``All the executioner does is start the cycle by turning a switch
or pressing a button _ I won't say which _ and the thing is
programmed from there,'' Burton said.
   The executioner stands in a booth behind and to the right of the
electric chair, watching through a 9-inch-by-4-foot opening in the
wall as the condemned prisoner is buckled into the chair. A light on
a panel of dials before the executioner indicates that the current
is sufficient.
   When Burton gives the signal, the executioner activates the
machine, which pumps up to 3,000 volts and 20 amps of electricity
through the chair and into the body.

<TEXT>
   About 47 pounds of cocaine was discovered Tuesday on
an Eastern Airlines jet that had stopped at Miami International
Airport en route from Colombia to New York, officials said.
   No arrests were made by late Tuesday and U.S. Customs officials
are considering whether fines will be levied against the financially
troubled carrier, fined $1 million last fall after cocaine was
discovered on two flights within a two-week span, said Customs
spokesman Cliff Stallings.
   Before the cocaine was found, the plane had been cleared by
Customs inspectors following a routine search, said Stallings.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said a flight attendant found
a plastic packet containing cocaine inside one of the exit doors,
leading to an extensive search of the L-1011 aircraft that arrived
from Cali, Columbia, at about 4 p.m. EST.
   The cocaine was between the panels of the door and above the
lavatories of Flight 50, she said.
   But Stallings said several packets of cocaine were discovered by
a member of the cleaning crew in the rest rooms. He said vibrations
apparently dislodged the cocaine, which was concealed behind ceiling
panels above the rest rooms.
   Stallings said the manner the cocaine was hidden suggests it was
placed by someone with extensive access to and knowledge of the
plane.
   The search was completed about 9:30 p.m. EST, he said.
   All passengers were accommodated on other flights, Ms. Ceremsak
said.
   Since Sept. 13, Customs agents have seized five loads of cocaine
on Eastern flights from Colombia, including 68 pounds of cocaine
hidden in a box of ground coffee in November and 56 pounds of
cocaine found in a mail bag in October.
   Eastern says it spends more than $3 million a year fighting drug
trafficking.
   Avianca, Colombia's national airline, banned cargo from its
flights last June after paying $8 million in federal fines linked to
drug seizures.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: A President Who Stops for Stop Lights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush stops at red lights. Sometimes.
   In a city used to seeing dignitary-bearing motorcades screeching
through traffic lights, sirens wailing, at all times of day and
night, the sight is more than a little unusual.
   There was Bush's 15-car motorcade, waiting for a traffic light to
change, right along with other backed-up traffic on a busy downtown
Washington street. No sirens. No flashing police-car lights.
   The president was on his way to a local Army base, Fort McNair,
for a Tuesday afternoon jog and didn't want to disrupt traffic any
more than was necessary.
   It's not as though anyone would write him a traffic ticket.
   He was simply following a pattern he'd established in his eight
years as vice president, said aide Bruce Zanca. ``Mr. Bush's
preference as vice president was to stop at lights, keep things as
normal as possible,'' Zanca said.
   Of course, as vice president, Bush didn't require 15 cars to go
jogging.
   He just stepped outside his door and ran. The vice president's
residence is on the sprawling grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory,
and there's lots of space for jogging and other outdoor activities.
   There isn't as much room at the White House, forcing the new
president to seek out new jogging trails.
   Bush once suggested that he might return to the vice presidential
grounds from time to time to do his jogging, joking that he had
already sought _ and obtained _ permission from the man who would be
living there next, Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Bush, 64, jogs at a relatively sedate pace, about a mile every 10
minutes. He usually runs for 20 minutes, two or three times a week.
   The chief executive's decision to observe traffic signals
apparently only applies to personal trips, not when he's going
somewhere on official business.
   Then, it's the regular presidential motorcade _ which gets an
elaborate police escort and travels on streets where traffic has
already been cleared. Such motorcades completely ignore traffic
signals along the way.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bush, who is trim at 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, may jog to help
counter the waistline-expanding effect of another presidential
passion: deep-fried pork rinds.
   When Bush held his first Cabinet meeting on Monday, gone was the
crystal jar of jellybeans that predecessor Ronald Reagan used to
have sitting before him.
   By Tuesday, there was a large jar again _ only this one was
filled with pork rinds.
   It was a gift of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, one of a
group of House and Senate leaders that Bush had invited to meet with
him in the Cabinet Room to discuss the budget.
   Wright also presented fellow Texan Bush with a large bottle of
``Texas Pete'' hot pepper sauce.
   Bush is known to love to smother all manner of food with hot
sauce. During his campaign, a standard meal for Bush aboard Air
Force Two was tuna fish sandwiches drenched with hot sauce.
   ``We want to give a very warm welcome to the president,'' said
Wright.
   Bush picked up the bottle of hot sauce and closely examined the
label.
   ``How come Texas hot sauce is made in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina?''
   Wright retorted: ``Same way that some Texans were born in
Kennebunkport.''
   The room erupted in laughter, even though Wright's citation of
Bush's New England origins was off by a few states.
   While his family maintains a vacation home in the seaside resort
town of Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush was born in Milton, Mass., and
grew up in Connecticut.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed by both the pork rinds and the Texas hot
sauce,'' Bush said. ``You talk about cooperation, ecumenical spirit,
outreach. Just lovely.''

<HEAD>Elected Officials Top Half-Million Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big government in Washington may get the most
publicity, but a new Census Bureau report shows that government is
big business in the rest of the country as well, with more than a
half-million Americans holding elective office.
   From school board president to the nation's president, Congress
to county commissioner, public officials total 504,404, the bureau
reported Tuesday in a study based on its 1987 census of governments.
   That's up from 490,807 elected officials counted a decade
earlier, the bureau said.
   ``It's quite a statement about the extent of democracy,
particularly the grassroots democracy, in the country,'' said Diana
Cull, a census statistician who compiled the figures.
   It means the United States now has more officeholders than bank
tellers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated there were 467,000
tellers in 1987.
   But while the report found that holding public office is
widespread, it also shows officeholders don't necessarily represent
a cross-section of the nation.
   Only 20 percent were women, while 2 percent were blacks and 1
percent were Hispanic. Nationally, women make up just over half the
population while the nation is about 12 percent black and 7 percent
Hispanic.
   Most of the growth in elected officeholders since 1977 results
from the growth of special districts around the nation, Ms. Cull
said. These include independent water and sewer districts, housing
authorities, transit administrations and similar independent bodies
with elected boards.
   Special districts accounted for 80,509 elected officials on
29,532 governmental bodies in the 1987 study. That's up from 72,377
officeholders running 25,962 special districts in 1977.
   That increase of more than 8,000 officials was well ahead of any
other group, although special districts were only fourth in the
total number of officeholders. Municipalities, towns and school
districts continue to have larger totals of officials elected to
public office.
   The leading group is municipalities, with 137,688 officials
serving 19,200 communities in 1987. That's up from 134,017
officeholders in 18,862 municipalities in 1977.
   Townships came in second in both years, totaling 120,790
officials in 1987 and 118,966 a decade earlier year. During that
period the total number of township governments declined from 16,822
to 16,691.
   School districts were the nation's third largest job source for
elected officials, providing offices for 86,772 people in 1987. That
was down from 1977, however, when 87,062 people held elected school
board positions.
   That drop occurred in parallel with a decline in the number of
school districts in the nation, slipping from 15,174 to 14,721.
   The nation's 3,042 counties _ the same in both studies _ provided
somewhat fewer elected offices in 1987 than in 1977. The total fell
from 62,922 to 59,932.
   The states, meanwhile, increased their number of elected offices.
They harbored 18,171 elected officials in 1987, up from 15,294 in
1977.
   The 1977 report did not include figures for federal
officeholders. The new study put that number at 542, a total which
Ms. Cull said was unchanged.
   Elected federal officials include 435 members of the House, 100
senators, five congressional delegates from territories and the
District of Columbia and, of course, the president and vice
president.
   The 1987 report looked at the characteristics of local government
officials for the first time, Cull said.
   It found that women were most likely to be on school boards,
making up 26.5 percent of elected school officials. Women
constituted 23.1 percent of township officials and 20.8 percent of
county officers. They were 18.5 percent of the municipal officials
and only 11.5 percent of those serving on special districts.
   Blacks, on the other hand, were most often represented on
municipal governments, holding 3.3 percent of those posts.
   Blacks made up 2.6 percent of the county officials and 2.4
percent of school district officeholders. They were 0.6 percent of
the special district officials and 0.4 percent in town offices.
   School districts were the most common spot for Hispanics, at 1.8
percent. They held 1.3 percent of municipal offices and 1.2 percent
in special districts. Hispanics comprised 1 percent of county
officials and 0.2 percent of town officers.

<HEAD>Income Growth Slowest in Energy States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal incomes are increasing the least in
the nation's energy states, while the coasts are recording the
biggest gains, the government reports.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the New England region had
the highest increase in personal incomes of any region, an 8.9
percent gain in the 12 months ending with September 1988. Following
close behind were the far West states of California, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington with a gain of 8.7 percent.
   At the other extreme were the Rocky Mountain states, a region
heavily dependent on oil and gas exploration, where incomes rose 6.1
percent on average from the third quarter of 1987 to the third
quarter of last year.
   ``We are still seeing the effects of weak energy prices,'' said
Commerce Department analyst Rudolph DePass. ``While some states have
been able to diversify their economies, others have not.''
   Nationally, non-farm incomes rose 7.8 percent in the period
ending in September, virtually identical to the 7.7 percent rise in
overall incomes posted for the 12-month period ending with the
second quarter.
   New England has led the country in income growth for much of the
recovery following the 1981-82 recession as its high-technology
industries have benefited from the big defense buildup of the Reagan
years.
   However, the rate of income growth has slowed in this area in the
past year, reflecting a slowdown in defense spending, DePass said.
   The most recent quarterly reports have shown that income growth
in America's Rust Belt has begun to stage a comeback, reflecting a
rebound in U.S. manufacturing as a weaker dollar has made American
goods competitive once again on overseas markets.
   The rebound in manufacturing has helped narrow but not eliminate
the bi-coastal lead in incomes, the department said.
   Critics of economic policies during the Reagan years say the
record peacetime recovery has essentially been a bi-coastal
expansion, with both coasts doing well while America's heartland
suffered.
   Over the 12 months ending with September 1988, incomes in coastal
states have grown by 8.3 percent, 6 percent above the national
average, while income in interior regions of the country grew 7
percent, 10 percent below the national average.
   Earlier in the expansion the difference was much wider with
coastal growth 10 percent higher than the national average while
interior regions were growing 17 percent below the national average.
   By state, Nevada had the biggest percentage increase for the 12
months ending in September, a 12.9 percent gain fueled by big
increases in construction payrolls. Hotel and motel construction
there reflected a boom in tourism.
   Nevada was followed by a 9.9 percent gain in non-farm incomes in
New Hampshire and a 9.6 percent rise in Hawaii. Also posting large
increases were Massachusetts and Florida, both at 9.3 percent.
   With inflation rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent last year,
the figures showed that these states stayed well ahead of the
increase in prices.
   At the other end of the scale, income growth in some states just
barely kept up with the rise in prices.
   Wyoming ranked last with a 4.2 percent rise in non-farm incomes
over the period ending with the third quarter, followed by Alaska
with a 4.8 percent increase. Other states with low income growth
were Colorado, 5.2 percent; North Dakota, 5.3 percent; New Mexico,
5.3 percent, and West Virginia, 5.8 percent _ all states where
depressed energy prices have hurt incomes.
   The Commerce Department focuses on changes in non-farm income as
a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often
erratic nature of agriculture.

<TEXT>
   NBC and the Super Bowl, taking a cue from the
San Francisco 49ers, came out winners in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
television ratings last week.
   The Super Bowl coverage came in first by a wide margin. The
postgame show was second, also by a comfortable margin.
   NBC, in its 31st weekly victory for the season, took eight places
in the top 10 and easily won the week that ended Sunday.
   The 49ers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl as
NBC's coverage got a rating of 44.6. Each ratings point equals
904,000 homes with television, so more than 40 million homes tuned
in to the game. The postgame show had a rating of 32.5.
   The first part of the NBC miniseries ``Brotherhood of the Rose,''
which followed the game Sunday, placed ninth.
   A rerun of NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was third, with a rating of
25.3. NBC's ``Cheers'' was fourth.
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' the biggest new hit of the season, was fifth,
and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?,'' was sixth as the network came in
second.
   Rounding out the top 10 were NBC's ``A Different World,''
seventh; ``Golden Girls,'' eighth; and ``L.A. Law,'' tenth.
   Third-place CBS had only one show in the top 20, its coverage of
the inaugural gala in Washington, which placed 20th. CBS' high-rated
Sunday show, ``Murder, She Wrote,'' was knocked to 46th place by the
Super Bowl coverage.
   NBC won the week with an average of 20.0. ABC had 12.1 and CBS
12.0.
   In the season to date, NBC has 15.6, ABC 13.0, and CBS 12.4.
   In the news category, ABC won with an 11.7 rating, closely
followed by CBS' 11.6 and NBC's 11.5.

   Hard-nosed highway engineers from across
America watched as workmen in gray laboratory smocks smoothed out a
fresh-laid bed of concrete on the floor of a hotel ballroom.
   They may have been witnesses to the dawning of a new age of
cement.
   The product called Pyrament (cement that lasts as long as the
Pyramids) will divide cement history into eras: ``B.P. and A.P. _
Before Pyrament and After Pyrament,'' proclaimed James E. Stewart,
chairman of Lone Star Industries,
   ``It's a material as close to stone as anything can be without
being stone,'' Stewart said.
   Concrete is a mixture of cement powder, sand, water and gravel.
Concrete made of Pyrament hardens in four hours. Some poured at 9:30
a.m. Tuesday in the ballroom of the Omni-Shoreham Hotel was hard as
a rock at lunchtime.
   That means fix a highway in the night and traffic can roll on it
during the next morning's rush hour. By contrast, conventional
concrete takes a week or two to cure.
   Pyrament costs six to eight cents a pound, twice as much as
ordinary cement. ``But the cost of the cement is an insignificant
part of the cost of construction,'' said Stewart.
   Lone Star, which makes a tenth of the 90 million tons of cement
consumed each year in the United States, has been losing business to
cheap imported cement.
   The company's cement and concrete profits fell in half in 1987.
It thinks Pyrament, whose formula is secret, may be the answer to
its prayers.
   The company invited a thousand transportation research
executives, attending a convention, to come kick its tires.
   They tried to be skeptical.
   ``I've put down an awful lot of test pavement in my 33 years as a
professor of civil engineering,'' said James M. Hoover of Iowa State
University, who once worked for the Pottawattamie County Engineering
Department in Iowa. ``This shows excellent potential in terms of
flexural and compressive strengths.''
   Said Herman Griffin, a transportation engineer specializing in
highway maintenance for the Georgia Department of Transportation:
``I'd like to get some and mix it and put it down in the real world.
And see if it does as good as they say.''
   Not only can highways be repaired overnight, Lone Star said, but:
   _Pyrament's extra strength will permit thinner concrete beams,
allowing skyscrapers to have more floors in the same height as those
built with run-of-the-mill concrete.
   _Pyrament will cure in temperatures as low as 28 degrees
Fahrenheit. Conventional concrete won't harden when the temperature
falls below 35. So the construction season can be extended deeper
into the winter.
   _Pyrament can be used to repair emergency facilities in
earthquakes or airport runways in combat.
   _Potholes may become things of the past. Rather than patch them
with asphalt, repair crews will be able to remove a potholed panel
of roadway and replace it overnight.
   The company is road-testing this slogan: ``Repair at night and
drive at dawn.''

<HEAD>New Group Campaigns For No-Fault Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>B1y GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   True no-fault auto insurance could mean savings
of hundreds of dollars for families in some states although the
overall impact on premiums nationwide would be little more than 6
percent, according to a study commissioned by a group backing
universal no-fault.
   The new study did not identify which states would see such large
savings, and its sponsors said they were still ``massaging the
data'' to come up with those estimates.
   The analysis by Edward J. Heiden, a Washington consultant, for
the new group New Start, said consumers in 47 states could be
expected to save $3.7 billion in premiums overall under a true
no-fault system.
   There are 135 million cars on the road, and the study said the
average auto insurance premium was $434 per car in 1987.
   This would imply a national insurance bill of $59 billion if
there were no uninsured cars and no trucks used as cars were
counted. If that $59 billion is true, the $3.7 billion saving would
be a little more than 6 percent.
   ``It is reasonable to conclude that some households could see
declines in their annual insurance bills of as much as several
hundred dollars'' if plans similar to those of Michigan, Florida and
New York were used nationwide, the group said.
   New Start considers those states to have the only true no-fault
systems. Twelve states and the District of Columbia use elements of
no-fault in their insurance law, and 11 states have what the group
calls ``phony no-fault.''
   Under no-fault, victims file claims against their own companies,
just as they would for medical insurance. The companies are supposed
to pay no matter who is at fault.
   With traditional insurance, a victim must sue somebody to
determine who caused the accident and whose insurance must pay.
   The New Start group was organized by James L. Brown, director of
the Center for Consumer Affairs at the University of Wisconsin and
the Rev. Robert J. McEwen, professor of economics at Boston College.
Brown said no insurance industry funds had been used in forming the
new organization, which he said has gained 20,000 members since it
was born last October.
   Virginia Knauer, consumer affairs adviser to Presidents Nixon,
Ford and Reagan, will be national chair of the group and will
undertake a coast-to-coast tour next month to drum up support for
converting all states to no-fault.
   Rising premiums in states with traditional insurance have
prompted political outcries in several states recently. California
voters last fall passed a referendum requiring companies to reduce
premiums 20 percent.
   Nationwide, auto insurance premiums increased 60 percent from
1982 to 1987 while the Consumer Price Index was increasing 17
percent.
   Critics say this overpays those who aren't hurt much and pays too
little to the badly injured. It jams the courts with lawsuits that
take years to reach verdicts and, according to a 1985 Transportation
Department study, return to victims only half of premiums paid in _
43 percent in states using no no-fault elements at all.
   The balance of premium income goes to lawyers and to administer
the system.
   In theory, lawsuits are banned under no-fault. Michigan, New York
and Florida limit litigation to people who have suffered ``serious
and permanent'' injury. This restriction greatly reduces the number
of suits, the group said.
   The 11 ``phony no-fault'' states permit suits only by people
suffering losses greater than a stated threshold, which ranges up to
$6,000 in Hawaii, Ms. Knauer said.
   No-fault has been defeated or watered down because of trial
lawyers, who stand to profit from the traditional system, the group
said.
   Bill Wagner of Tampa, Fla., president of the Association of
American Trial Lawyers, said he'd be for any system that would
support any system to ``ensure fair treatment to injured people,''
but under no-fault victims rapidly see ``the economic power of the
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights.''

<HEAD>Signs of Drought Remain in Winter Wheat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report says there has been little
relief for parched winter wheat fields in huge areas of the Great
Plains, the middle of the nation's breadbasket.
   Winter wheat was planted last fall and will be harvested this
summer. Normally, it provides about three-fourths of the U.S. wheat
supply. Farmers will sow the remainder this spring.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that insects
along with dry weather also continued to damage wheat during the
week of Jan. 16-22. The facility is operated by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments.
   Winter wheat is watched closely this time of year for signs of
damage and potential yield losses. It will lead off the 1989 harvest
season.
   Historically, January is the driest month in the plains states,
and winter wheat, usually dormant at midwinter, has been known to
improve dramatically as the result of good moisture in February and
March.
   But drought reduced 1988 production, and there has been a heavy
drain on U.S. and world stockpiles. And the possibility of further
losses in 1989 cannot be ignored.
   ``In Kansas, winter wheat continued to show moisture stress,''
the report said. ``Greenbug damage was a continuing problem in the
southwest and southcentral areas (of the state).''
   The dry conditions were causing winter wheat in Oklahoma to turn
yellow, and mild temperatures have allowed greenbugs to multiply.
   Rain helped conditions in parts of Texas, but dry soils continued
to hurt winter grains in many areas, the report said. Greenbug
damage was apparent in many fields, too.
   ``Snow cover was needed in most of the northern plains,'' the
report said. ``Snow cover was adequate in North Dakota and portions
of South Dakota. Montana's winter wheat was mostly fair to good,
with only light wind damage.''
   The Oregon winter wheat crop was reported in mostly good
condition, and it was said to be in ``mostly good to fair'' shape in
the Corn Belt but lacked protective snow cover.
   ``Small grains in the (Mississippi) Delta and Southeast were
mostly good, the report said. ``Seeding continued in Arizona and
California. Wet soil slowed seeding in California.''
   The above-normal temperatures reduced livestock stress during the
week in most areas, although there were some respiratory problems in
Illinois, the report said. Rain helped improve pastures in Florida
and in central and southern Texas.
   Looking at some other crops, the report said:
   _Rain slowed land preparation and fertilizer application in the
Delta. Tobacco plant bed preparation and seeding continued in the
Southeast. In California, cotton seedbeds were pre-irrigated and
fertilizer.
   _Needed rain benefited Florida's citrus areas, and most producers
were able to discontinue irrigation.
   _Florida's vegetable areas also benefited from rain, and spring
crop planting has been moving along. Winter harvest of vegetables
also continued during the week, with tomatoes, peppers, cabbage,
celery, lettuce and squash among the volume leaders.
   _Rain slowed the Texas vegetable harvest, and cold weather
hampered work in California.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
635,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, virtually
wiping out its current purchase authority under an Agriculture
Department program.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday the wheat
was part of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the
United States, now in its sixth year.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in February and March.
Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the
Soviets have only 35,200 tons still available under the program.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 1.65 million
tons of U.S. wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. The
agreement expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec.
31, 1990.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 635,000 tons of
wheat would be about 23.3 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $93 million.
   Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the
Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of
grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized.

   An Agriculture Department report says catfish
farmers ended 1988 with larger production and higher prices than
they did the year before.
   December output rose 10 percent from a year earlier to 22.6
million pounds of live weight, and prices averaged 78 cents per
pound, up 14 cents, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board
said Tuesday.
   In all of last year, farm-grown catfish production was 295.1
million pounds, up 5 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Urged to be More Aggressive Advocate for US Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher
got a warm welcome at his Capitol Hill debut and received a stern
admonition to make the government a more aggressive advocate for
American businesses in the world marketplace.
   At Mosbacher's confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate
Commerce Committee, several legislators complained that the United
States, which suffered a record trade deficit of $170.1 billion in
1987, doesn't do enough to protect and promote its industries in
global trade.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the nation suffers from ``a
bureaucratic reluctance to be aggressive in support of American
industry.''
   ``We're losing everything, all the technology,'' committee
Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., told Mosbacher. ``What we really
need is your enthusiasm, your toughness and aggressiveness. ...
Don't just flutter around Washington and say: `Free trade, free
trade. We don't want to start a trade war.'''
   Mosbacher, a Texas oilman and longtime friend of President Bush,
pledged vigorous enforcement of laws designed to protect American
businesses from unfair foreign competition and said that building
exports will be his top priority in reducing the trade deficit.
   ``While we certainly do and have opened our nation to the goods
of the world, we expect that to be reciprocated,'' he said. ``If it
is not, I don't see that we have any course but to strongly, fairly,
objectively, totally enforce'' the laws governing international
trade.
   Asked his strategy for addressing the U.S. trade deficit, he
said, ``We must build our exports first.''
   He called for greater efforts to educate U.S. businesses about
export opportunities and for reduced red tape in granting export
licenses for items whose sales would not harm national security or
strategic interests.
   ``Everything that is not in those two categories should be given
(a) license ... as soon as possible,'' he said.
   American exports have strengthened as the weaker dollar has made
U.S. manufacturers' products more competitive overseas. But analysts
believe the dollar would have to decline further to spur more export
gains.
   Mosbacher, one of four Texans named to the Bush Cabinet, comes to
Washington without government experience and after making his
fortune in the oil business. His nomination is expected to win easy
approval from the committee next week.
   Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texan, told the committee
that Mosbacher was a tough international businessman who would ``do
the job that has to be done'' in making America more competitive.

   A young man pleaded guilty to robbing
an American tourist and in a fit of remorse asked that his 12-year
jail sentence be increased, the government's news agency reported
today.
   The agency said Judge Leonardo B. Canares of Cebu City, 350 miles
south of Manila, immediately obliged Wesley Corpus' request and
slapped one more year onto the jail term.
   The agency said the incident occurred Tuesday after Corpus
pleaded guilty to robbery charges and told the judge he felt the
original 12-year sentence was not enough.
   Corpus was accused of robbing an unidentified American of a gold
necklace worth $250.

   Singer Mel Torme says he expects to be
left out of the winner's circle this year at the Grammys, thanks to
his criticism of the award panel that voted him honors two years in
a row.
   Torme, who will be appearing at the Sands Hotel, Casino and
Country Club this weekend, blasted the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences for failing to nominate his partner on both
award-winning albums, pianist George Shearing.
   By 1982, Torme had received 11 Grammy nominations for Best Jazz
Vocalist. Because five of the nominated albums were collaborations
with Shearing, Torme asked the nominating committee why Shearing had
been ignored.
   ``They told me they had no category for him,'' Torme said. ``So
we make the album `An Evening With George Shearing and Mel Torme,'
'' Torme said. ``George asked me `why do you want to do this?' I
told him now, `We are a duo and that there is a duo category.'
Again, I got nominated and he didn't.''
   That album gave Torme his first Grammy in 1983, and in 1984 the
duo's follow-up ``Top Drawer'' earned him his second.
   This year, he is nominated for ``A Vintage Year,'' while Shearing
is again ignored. The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 22 on CBS-TV.
   ``I won't win this Grammy. I have come to understand how the
Grammys work, said the 64-year-old singer, who last year published
his autobiography, ``It Wasn't All Velvet.''
   ``I know that some of the people who vote don't like what I have
to say.''

   Actor Karl Malden says he's more nervous
about traveling since filming a television drama about a cruise ship
hijacked by terrorists.
   ``You think twice before you say you want to travel. And I think
that's terrible,'' he said Tuesday. ``In this business I'm in you
travel an awful lot.''
   The 72-year-old Malden, who flew to Australia to film the TV
movie ``The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro,'' has been acting more
than 50 years, including roles in the TV series ``Streets of San
Francisco'' and the movies ``Patton'' and ``Nuts.''
   The movie about the 1985 hijacking of an Italian cruise ship is
to be broadcast Feb. 13 on NBC.
   Malden is in Nashville to teach two weeks of acting classes at
Vanderbilt University.

   Sylvester Stallone, well-rested from
his 1985 triumph over a Russian hulk in ``Rocky IV,'' will write,
direct and star in ``Rocky V,'' MGM announced.
   The latest chapter in the heroic fisticuffs saga of Rocky Balboa
is scheduled to begin filming this fall for release in the summer of
1990, the studio said Tuesday.
   MGM did not release plot details of the next Rocky installment,
saying only that ``the Italian Stallion faces the greatest challenge
of his personal and professional life.''
   Stallone announced Monday he had signed a five-picture deal with
Carolco Pictures. In his first project under that deal, Stallone
will star as a prison inmate who rebels against a tyrannical warden.
That movie, now untitled, will begin filming in February.
   Stallone's fourth ``Rambo'' movie is set to begin filming in 1990
for release the following year.

   The Duchess of York, dubbed ``Her Royal Idleness''
by British tabloids who accused her of preferring play to work, went
back on duty at a dinner held to start a fund-raising campaign for
British museums.
   As royal patron of an organization called Museums Year, she was
guest of honor Tuesday at the dinner attended by rock star and
charity aid promoter Bob Geldof; the editor of The Times of London,
Charles Wilson, and other celebrities.
   The 29-year-old duchess, who as Sarah Ferguson married Prince
Andrew in 1986, looked slim and elegant in a black Tudor-style dress
with fitted velvet bodice and leg-of-mutton sleeves. She shed
several pounds by dieting after the birth of her daughter, Princess
Beatrice, on Aug. 8.
   As she and Andrew enjoyed a Swiss skiing break earlier this
month, Britain's brassy tabloids razzed the duchess as ``Her Royal
Idleness'' and ``Duchess Dolittle'' for what they alleged was her
love of holidays and jet-setting lifestyle.
   A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of Britain's
royal family put Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, at the bottom,
with only 30 last year. Sarah was next with only 55, less than half
those performed by her husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen
Mother Elizabeth.

   Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned the
vice presidency 15 years ago, was in good condition after he fell
from a bicycle and broke a hip during the weekend.
   Agnew, 70, who lives near Eisenhower Medical Center, was admitted
to the hospital Sunday afternoon after being taken there by
ambulance, hospital spokesman Mike McFadden said Monday.
   Agnew resigned the vice presidency in 1973 just before pleading
no contest to federal charges of tax evasion on $29,500 he received
in 1967 while governor of Maryland. Agnew, who was vice president
for nearly five years under Richard Nixon, had been elected governor
in 1966.
   The only other vice president to resign from office was John C.
Calhoun in 1832.

   When lawyers asked a second time for
permission to file a not-so-brief legal brief that would break the
state court's 50-page limit, the attorney on the opposite side
responded in terse verse.
   As Deputy state Attorney General Asher Rubin told the 1st
District Court of Appeal:
   ``Now plaintiffs come in once again. They claim that it's
outrageous, that lawyers of their stature should be cuffed to 50
pages.
   ``We urge the court to rule once more that 50 is the limit, for
otherwise their brief will be too long to even skim it.
   ``The issues can be analyzed in pages less than 50, if plaintiffs
could with thought and words endeavor to be thrifty.''
   Rubin said Tuesday, ``I couldn't resist.''
   He said he's taking a more serious approach to the merits of the
case, a lawsuit by low-income patients seeking to require that the
state reimburse counties for their care.

   In their far-ranging quest for new markets,
Michigan cherry growers have come up with some unusual products.
Take the cherry-pecan sausage, for example. Please.
   ``Cook it up slow, not too fast, and you'll think you died and
went to heaven,'' said Ray Pleva, the dish's inventor.
   ``It's a mild-tasting sausage with a light cherry flavor. It's
not sweet. It's not sour,'' said Pleva, who runs Pleva's Meats in
Leelanau County, the heart of the nation's cherry industry.
   Pleva's inventiveness is exactly the sort of thing the newly
formed Cherry Marketing Institute in Lansing is encouraging. The
sausages are among a dozen cherry products the institute will
introduce in March at an international food exposition in Japan.
   Institute Manager Dick Johnston sees Japan as a market ripe for
the picking _ assuming the Japanese can be enticed by cherry-filled
pastries, cherry sausages or cherry mustard.
   The institute has the same problem at home. Americans consume 225
million pounds of cherries a year _ nearly a pound a person _ but
Johnston said the market has remained stagnant.
   Cherry entrepreneurs, therefore, are spending more time in the
kitchen inventing new ways to use an old fruit.
   Pleva concocted his cherry-pecan sausages last fall, when his
daughter, Cindy, was the National Cherry Queen. He admits he has met
some skeptics.
   ``You should see some of the looks,'' said Pleva. ``But they
change when they taste it.

   There was a jailbreak at the new $2.5
million Erath County Jail, but Sheriff David Coffee and his deputies
weren't upset.
   They were just relieved to get out.
   It seems that Coffee and some of his deputies accidentally got
locked inside a hallway between cells at the jail Monday and had to
stage a breakout to get free.
   The unplanned lock-in occurred as the sheriff was showing off the
as yet unopened jail's security system. When the door to the control
room suddenly slammed shut, all the doors locked automatically,
leaving the keys inside the control room and the lawmen trapped
outside.
   It took about an hour, but the posse finally devised a plan of
escape.
   They found two poles left from the construction work and fitted
them together, inserted them through a slot in the control room door
and retrieved the keys.

<HEAD>Senators Prepare Legislative Response to Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and a conservative Republican member are
drafting companion bills aimed at punishing countries that use
chemical weapons and the private Western companies that help produce
them.
   The bills were announced at a hearing Tuesday in which senators
cited reports that the West German government did nothing to prevent
German industries from helping Middle Eastern nations obtain
chemical warfare capability.
   Also at the hearing, the head of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency said the United States is now satisfied West
Germany is responsibly addressing the situation and will act soon to
tighten export controls.
   The arms control chief, William F. Burns, also told senators that
the Soviet Union is stockpiling biological weapons in violation of a
1972 agreement banning them worldwide.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he is readying a bill to require U.S.
diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using chemical
or biological weapons. He said the legislation will ask other
nations to do likewise.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he will sponsor companion
legislation to impose sanctions against companies of any nationality
supplying chemical warfare equipment and technology to Third World
nations.
   ``I have every reason to believe that, in the end, the Congress
and the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches,''
Helms said.
   Burns told the hearing that about 20 nations have the capacity to
produce chemical weapons. He said about five or six are known to
have used or stockpiled them.
   Responding to questions, Burns listed Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria
and North Korea as poison gas stockpilers. He said Iran, Iraq and
Libya are reported to have used chemical weapons.
   Burns also said the United States believes the Soviet Union is
maintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972
international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession of
germ warfare agents.
   ``We believe the Soviet Union does have a stock of biological
weapons and obviously they must have some capacity to produce
them,'' Burns said.
   Helms asked how, in that case, the Soviets can be trusted to
comply with a new international agreement, soon to be negotiated,
banning the manufacture, stockpiling and use of poison gas and other
chemical weapons.
   Burns replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions for
monitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will have
verification provisions.
   He acknowledged, however, that verification will be difficult and
that perfect monitoring probably cannot be achieved.
   Helms complained that West German companies were helping Third
World countries, especially in the Middle East, obtain chemical
weapons capability.
   He also said a West German company is helping Libya obtain the
ability to refuel warplanes in flight, extending their range and
giving them the ability to strike Israel.
   ``The problem is extremely grim,'' Helms said. ``With the
critical assistance of Western industrial firms, the four most
radical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of mass
destruction.''
   Burns, who said he had discussed the situation with officials of
the West German Embassy, said the attitude of the Bonn government
has changed significantly.
   ``I think the West German government is on the right track and I
applaud the activities they are undertaking now,'' Burns said.

   Craig Matalon is searching for his lost

   Matalon accidentally left Kinky's cage open on Saturday night.
The 14-year-old female kinkajou climbed out, and was last seen early
Sunday by a neighbor.
   ``She can't live alone,'' he said. ``She'd walk up to somebody,
but I don't think anybody would know what to do with her.''
   Kinky, about the size of a large house cat, has short,
golden-colored hair, big brown eyes, a long tail and sharp claws.
   ``She looks like a teddy bear,'' he said. ``You can't help but to
fall in love with this animal.
   `I feel like I lost a child,'' said Matalon, who has owned Kinky
since she was 2 weeks old.
   The kinkajou, a raccoon-like animal native to South America, is
about 9 inches long and weighs no more than 10 pounds, said Lani
Wigand, director of education at the Broward County Humane Society.

<HEAD>Brown Emerges as Clear Front-runner for Democratic Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney Ronald Brown has emerged as the
front-runner in the race for Democratic Party chairman, despite
complaints from party conservatives about his association with Jesse
Jackson in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Brown picked up endorsements from West Virginia Democrats on
Tuesday, the latest in a series of announcements that cemented his
position as the man to beat in the race to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr.
as chairman of the party.
   At the same time, an Alabama party leader said election of Brown
as chairman would be a victory for the ``Kennedy, Cuomo, Dukakis
ultra-liberal element.''
   John Baker, Alabama Democratic Party chairman, said Brown was
trying ``play on the liberal conscience'' by making an issue of the
fact that he is black and had ties to Jackson.
   ``He stands up and he says `I'm the most qualified candidate' _
which is a ridiculously presumptuous statement _ and if I wasn't
black I'd win and if I wasn't connected to Jesse Jackson I'd win,''
said Baker.
   ``That's tremendously presumptive and that's a slap at the other
candidates. It's Ron Brown who's creating that, trying to play on
the liberal conscience.''
   Among those who have endorsed Brown, who was Jackson's convention
manager last year, are Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo. Party sources said Michael Dukakis would add his
backing to Brown by week's end and that Democratic National
Committee members from Massachusetts would join their governor in
that endorsement.
   Also competing for the party leadership are Michigan Democratic
Party chairman Richard Wiener and former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma
and James Stanton of Ohio.
   Wiener and Jones met over the weekend and sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility of
combining forces. However, the sources said they were unable to
reach agreement on which should drop out and support the other.
   Democratic National Committee members will vote Feb. 10 to fill
the chairmanship for a four-year term, but many committee members
say they hope the race will be settled before the vote.
   ``A lot of us want it to be over before we get to Washington,''
said Suellen Albrecht, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party.
   When Brown first began seeking support for the chairmanship, his
role in the Jackson campaign was cited by Jews prominent in party
affairs as a reason for opposing him.
   However, a group of Jewish activists including Rep. Sander Levin
of Michigan, Steve Grossman of Massachusetts, a leading fund-raiser
for Dukakis; Ed Sanders and Steve Moses of Los Angeles; and Walter
Shorenstein of San Francisco endorsed Brown and worked to convince
Jewish Democrats that it was unfair to link Brown to Jackson.
   ``A number of us have talked to opinion-makers within the Jewish
community,'' said Levin.
   In an article written for Washington Jewish Weekly, Levin wrote
that ``Ron Brown did not subscribe to every position held by Jesse
Jackson. He has made clear that he would respond to Jesse Jackson as
to other Democratic leaders, with no hesitation to accept his views
when he is right nor to reject them when he is wrong.''
   Grossman raised money for Brown and also boosted his candidacy
among other Jews.
   ``I don't see Ron as being somehow a radical guy who just because
he was convention manager for Jesse somehow bought into all of
Jesse's rhetoric,'' he said.
   ``I recognize that for some the perception can be all wrong,''
said Grossman. ``They'll say Ron Brown can be the greatest guy in
the world, he can be a fine, wonderful guy with lots of judgment,
lots of vision, but it's just going to play badly in a lot of
places.''
   A Washington attorney who once was staff director of the Senate
Judiciary Committee when Kennedy was chairman, Brown agreed last
spring to serve as convention manager for Jackson. In that role, he
was widely credited with helping bring about the show of unity on
the closing night of the convention.
   Baker said that if Brown is elected chairman he would think it
was ``wasting the Alabama Democratic Party's money'' to continue
attending national party functions.
   ``You can't secede from the national party, though, frankly, I
would,'' he said.
   ``I'm not sure that's what we need right now,'' said James
Ruvolo, the Ohio Democratic Party chairman, who backs Wiener for the
national post.
   ``Mr. Baker's remarks not only surprise me, but they make me very
sad,'' said Pat Eddington, a Democratic National Committee member
from Alabama.

<HEAD>Small Businesses Say Tax Change Costs Them Money, Workers Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Committee on Small
Business says Congress should repeal a provision of the 1986 tax
overhaul that small business owners say has prompted them to
consider slashing employee benefits.
   Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., filed the legislation Tuesday, the
first of two days of hearings on Section 89 of the tax overhaul. The
section was designed to encourage expanded benefit programs but,
according to small business interests, has resulted in just the
opposite.
   ``This was a shortcut someone tried to make along the way that
ended up being a roadblock for small business instead of an aid,''
John Paul Galles, executive vice president of National Small
Business United, told the committee.
   Any changes to the law, however, would have to be approved by the
House Ways and Means Committee, which has been reluctant to tinker
with it because even minor changes bring calls for more significant
amendments.
   Section 89, which took effect Jan. 1, requires all business
owners to determine if their health and life insurance programs
discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. Discriminatory
benefits would be subject to higher taxation.
   Employees are defined as those who work 17 1@2 hours a week or
more. But witnesses at the hearing said using that definition will
inevitably lead to findings that most benefit plans are
discriminatory because employers routinely offer superior benefits
to full-time employees and those in highly skilled jobs.
   John S. Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative
Council, said the ``dramatic and unprecedented change in the
definition of employee'' would force cost-conscious small businesses
to either eliminate part-time positions to avoid being labeled
discriminatory or do away with employer-paid health benefits
altogether.
   The law also requires employers to inform employees of any
planned changes in benefit programs to bring the company in
compliance with the law.
   James Lagos, president of National Small Business United, said
most small businessmen are not aware of the law and are in effect
already violating it, either by not beginning the required tests or
by failing to properly notify workers of planned benefit changes.
   Instead of paying thousands of dollars or more to have their
benefit programs tested for compliance, many small business owners
have indicated they would eliminate employer-paid insurance and
instead give their workers a pay raise, Lagos said.
   That would hurt workers because their taxable income would
increase and they would have to pay higher health insurance rates
than would a business purchasing a group plan, Lagos said.

<HEAD>Alfonsin Declares War On Subversion After `Nightmare' Siege</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin declared
all-out war on leftist subversion after touring a suburban army base
where at least 36 people were killed in a battle between troops and
besieged civilian commandos.
   Troops were still scouring the smoldering rubble of the ravaged
La Tablada base Tuesday night as Alfonsin told the nation the attack
was ``a new challenge that I believe is the most serious and
decisive of my administration.''
   The 3rd Infantry Regiment base was seized Monday by heavily armed
civilians and retaken a day later by army and police forces who had
pummeled commando positions with howitzers, mortars, grenades and
machine-gun fire.
   In his nationally broadcast speech, the president recalled his
impressions of the base and the charred and mangled corpses he
encountered there: ``It was a nightmare. Death, once again death.
The brutality, the barbarity.''
   He said seven soldiers, one policeman and 28 commandos were
killed and that all but four of the 67 wounded were soldiers and
policemen.
   Authorities said troops captured 14 of the commandos, who
apparently intended to steal weapons from the base and quickly flee.
   Alfonsin described the attackers as ``irregular elements of
ultra-leftist affiliation,'' citing a written proclamation found at
the base as ``evidence of their hallucination.''
   A copy of the proclamation given to reporters said the base was
seized to pre-empt a purportedly imminent coup by right-wing army
officers.
   ``We are fed up with the arrogance of the military,'' it said.
   Alfonsin was elected in 1983 to end a nearly eight-year military
dictatorship during which 8,900 suspected leftist subversives were
arrested and vanished without a trace, presumably murdered by
security forces.
   Given such incidents as the La Tablada raid, a Dec. 4 military
uprising led by now-cashiered Col. Mohamed Seineldin, and the
subsequent bombing of the Communist Party's headquarters,
Argentine's fear that political extremism is returning to the
country.
   The English-language newspaper Buenos Aires Herald commented in
an editorial Tuesday:
   ``If the (La Tablada) attack did come from the extreme left, this
means that democracy is now under a two-pronged assault from right
and left for the first time in more than a decade....
   ``Now the army has the terrorist threat that has been missing so
long and the government must worry about the civilian left, not just
the military right.''
   Presidential elections are set for May 14. By law, Alfonsin
cannot run for re-election, and favored to win is the opposition
party candidate, Carlos Menem. Inflation is averaging more than 300
percent a year, real wages are declining and economic and social
unrest is high.
   Alfonsin on Tuesday set up a national security council. He did
not say who would sit on the body, but it was generally believed
that top military officials would be among its members.
   The president praised the soldiers' bravery in retaking the base,
and said: ``I want to tell them that this is also my fight ... and I
will fight it to the end.'' Looking on as he spoke were his military
chiefs of staff.
   The right-wing armed forces in this country that has seen six
military coups since 1930 have been a constant headache for Alfonsin.
   In the past 21 months, he has had to cope with three uprisings by
elements in the army angered by the prosecution of officers for
human rights abuses.
   Alfonsin has insisted that subversion be combatted within legal
bounds, unlike the military's ``dirty war'' of the 1970s when the
thousands of suspected leftists disappeared.
   ``This is our chance to show the world and ourselves that we have
learned from the past,'' he declared Tuesday night.
   The president said leftist extremism would be fought ``only
within the law, but with all the force of the law.''
   ``If anyone believes that democracy is a weak system, they now
are going to learn how wrong they are,'' he said. ``This is the last
great test of my government and we are not going to lose.''

   Some members of Congress, as well as the
lobbying groups that pay them, are self-conscious about the practice
of picking up large fees for speeches or panel discussions before
one interest group or another.
   Next week, for instance, the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors is hosting a two-day conference in
Washington where eight senators and four House members are scheduled
to speak.
   The association issued a notice, giving directions to the hotel
ballroom, times and topics, making sure reporters knew they were
welcome.
   It gave phone numbers in case anyone has any questions.
   Ask how much the senators and House members are being paid for
their speeches, and the conversation dies.
   ``I'm not prepared to get into an interview of that type,'' said
Dirk Van Dongen, president of the association.
   That kind of reaction is understandable, said Howard Marlowe,
president of the American League of Lobbyists, who would like to see
Congress abolish the practice of paying politicians to talk.
   The fees, known as honoraria, are an added source of personal
income for members of Congress, who can keep from $26,850 to $35,800
annually, depending on whether they are House or Senate members.
   ``It's perfectly legal, but the perception is that it's bad, so
therefore you have people who don't want to talk about it,'' Marlowe
said.
   ``We all in this town are competing for some forms of access and
power,'' he said. ``It is easier to buy it than to talk your way
into it _ that's buying access and not buying influence.''
   A proposal on Capitol Hill to ban the practice is informally
linked to boosting congressional salaries 50 percent from $89,500 to
$135,000.
   Members of Congress, who late in the spring are required to
disclose how much they make in speaking fees along with other
financial information, are not eager to give that out before they
have to.
   ``We are required by law to disclose that information on an
annual basis, but I don't think that it's a good idea to give it out
on a piecemeal basis,'' said David Dreyer, spokesman for Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., who made $78,500 in speaking fees in 1987, the
last year for which records are available.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., was reluctant to disclose how much
he's received in honoraria since Congress recessed before the
election last fall. But when pressed, his office acknowledged he got
$21,000 for making five speeches in Palm Springs, Calif., earlier
this month while he was at a golf tournament.
   Lawmakers in both houses can retain up to $2,000 per article or
event, with any fee exceeding that figure _ or any amount over the
annual cap _ going to charity.
   Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee which
writes the nation's tax laws, made $245,000 in speaking fees last
year and gave enough of it to charity to drop just below the House
limit, which at the time was less than $26,000.
   Rostenkowski wasn't alone in Palm Springs in mid-January.
   The Tobacco Institute hosted 27 members of Congress at a posh
resort near there, but institute spokesman Walker Merryman wouldn't
say how much they were paid or how much of their expenses were
picked up. He did say that everyone was treated equally.
   Among those attending the conference was Sen. Thomas A. Daschle,
D-S.D., whose office said he earned a $2,000 honorarium, along with
round-trip air fare for him and his wife and three nights' lodging.
The tab: $1,392.
   Marlowe said the league of lobbyists has not taken a position on
the issue of abolishing honoraria, but he favors getting rid of the
practice because of the bad appearance, which he compared to a skin
blemish.
   If it is banned, he said, some of Washington's finest minds will
start looking for loopholes.
   ``I honestly am stuck on what will rise up to take its place, but
I have every confidence in the ingenuity of the players involved
that something will rise up,'' he said. ``Just like the zits _
another one can pop up in its place.''

   After enduring more than a decade of Ted Bundy's
smug silence and denials, relatives of his acknowledged victims
found a chilling relief in his 11th-hour admission of a life of rape
and murder.
   ``The only thing I can say is thank God, it's finally over,''
said Vivian Rancourt of LaConner, whose 18-year-old daughter, Susan,
disappeared April 17, 1974. In the days before his execution
Tuesday, Bundy confessed to her slaying.
   But an investigator who heard some of Bundy's confessions said
there were crimes the serial killer wouldn't talk about and secrets
he took with him to Florida's electric chair.
   The 42-year-old Bundy, who was convicted of murdering three
people in Florida, admitted killing 23 other women after a decade of
denial, but he left a legacy of frustration for those who suspect he
killed many more.
   No one knows the enormity of Bundy's crimes. FBI officials said
years ago he might be implicated in 36 slayings throughout the West.
But Bundy's confessions included deaths to which he had not
previously been linked, such as two in Idaho, and he did not give
specifics on at least 10 others in which he was a suspect.
   ``I don't think we have even scratched the surface with Bundy,''
Sheriff Pete Hayward of Salt Lake County, Utah, said after the
execution. ``Somewhere there is someone Bundy has told the whole
story to.''
   Bundy confessed to eight Utah killings, but because he identified
only two victims there, authorities said many cases may never be
solved.
   Investigators said Bundy would not answer when asked about his
connection to two Utah deaths in which he is a suspect, including
the October 1974 strangulation and beating death of Laura Anne Aime,
17, of Salem, Utah.
   But there was no doubt Tuesday in the mind of her mother that
Bundy killed her child.
   ``He needed to die very badly,'' Shirlene Aime said, but she
conceded the last minutes of waiting for his execution were
``horrible.''
   ``It made me feel guilty,'' she said. ``Despite all the things he
did to my daughter and all the other girls, I started to think, `How
low am I, waiting for a man to die?' ''
   Her long-sought relief at Bundy's death was slow to come, she
said.
   ``I still have this empty feeling. I'm sick to my stomach. It's
an uptight, horrible feeling. But it is a relief to know he's gone,
and he won't do it again.''
   Bundy was executed for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old
Kimberly Leach of Lake City, Fla. He also was convicted of killing
two women in 1978 at a Florida State University sorority house. His
gush of confessions in the four days before his electrocution did
not include those deaths.
   Robert Keppel, an investigator for the Washington state attorney
general, said the law student dropout from Tacoma was unwilling in
interviews to talk about some cases that gave him ``painful
memories,'' and balked at confessing to deaths before 1973.
   ``That seemed to be where he drew the line,'' said Keppel, who
spent about two hours during the weekend extracting confessions from
a shaken, tearful Bundy.
   Keppel said Bundy denied kidnapping and killing 8-year-old Ann
Marie Burr in 1961, when Bundy would have been just 14. But the way
Bundy talked about that crime, he left doubt about whether he might
have been responsible, Keppel said.
   Ann Marie disappeared from her parents' Tacoma home, near where
Bundy's family lived, during an early morning rainstorm. No clue to
her fate has ever been found, though there have been years of
speculation _ including that of Ann Marie's parents _ that Bundy was
to blame.
   ``He denied that he did it,'' Keppel said. ``But he kind of
offered some qualifiers. He told me he was too young at the time. He
told me, `Serial killers start a little older than that.' And he
said, `The neighborhoods were so far apart.' And he said his
newspaper route wasn't close to the Burr residence.''
   Beverly Burr said Tuesday she feels strongly that Bundy was
responsible for her daughter's disappearance, but added: ``If it was
Bundy, then there's no way we're going to find out. We can't do
much. We're helpless.''
   Keppel said his opportunity to question Bundy was limited to
Friday and Sunday, when the killer gave considerable detail about
the string of eight ``Ted'' murders in 1974 in the Seattle area. But
time ran out before he could get details on other killings.
   ``He told me that he would never talk about some cases because
they were too close and too painful to talk about,'' he said.

   Police found some of the ``hot buns'' but not
the ``hamburglar'' who stole 150 rolls from a fast-food restaurant.
   The theft occurred between 10:45 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. Sunday at
the McDonald's restaurant across the street from the police
administration building, authorities said Tuesday.
   Five trays, each containing 30 of Big Mac rolls, were taken from
a storage area of the restaurant.
   The restaurant's manager later received an anonymous telephone
tip that the rolls could be found in a vacant house less than a mile
away, according to a police report. Police searched the house and
recovered four of the missing trays still loaded with rolls.
   One tray of 30 rolls, worth $20, was not found, police said.

<HEAD>Employment Costs Rose 5.0 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employment costs rose 5 percent last year
because of higher Social Security taxes and rising benefit costs
while wage and salary gains lagged behind inflation, according to
government data.
   The 5 percent rise in the cost of wages, salaries and
employer-paid benefits in 1988 compares with a 3.6 percent increase
in 1987, the Labor Department said Tuesday in releasing its
quarterly Employment Cost Index.
   Part of the overall increase in employment costs was attributed
to the increase in the employer's Social Security tax rate in
January 1988 from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent.
   Rising health insurance premiums were cited as a major factor in
the 6.8 percent increase in benefit costs to private employers in
1988 _ another force in driving overall employment costs up. The 6.8
percent increase in that area was nearly double the 3.5 percent jump
in benefit costs reported in 1987 and came after three years of
virtually identical growth in those costs.
   Although employment costs rose, the rate of wage and salary
increases lagged behind inflation for the second consecutive year.
The increase was 4.1 percent in 1988, much closer to inflation than
the 3.3 percent hike reported for 1987. Inflation averaged 4.4
percent both years.
   Continued low unemployment, which increases the competition for
available workers, was cited by analysts as the major reason for the
accelerated growth in wages in 1988 compared to 1987.
   ``It's clearly the decline in the unemployment rate,'' said
Cynthia Latta, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. ``There is less available labor
out there in the market, and it's harder to find what you want.''
   According to the Labor Department, employment costs rose by 5.6
percent among state and local governments in 1988, up from 4.4
percent in 1987.
   It cost private industry employers 4.9 percent more last year to
pay wages, salaries and benefits than it did in 1987, the department
said, compared with a 3.3 percent increase in 1987 over 1986.
Federal government employment costs are not included in the report.
   Sales workers, whose pay is heavily influenced by commissions,
experienced a 6.6 percent wage gain in 1988, up from just a 1
percent gain in 1987.
   Workers in the rapidly expanding service sector of the economy
experienced wage and salary gains of 4.7 percent, while those
working in goods-producing industries saw their pay increase on
average by 3.1 percent.
   For the fifth consecutive year non-union workers in private
industry received greater wage and salary increases than did their
unionized counterparts, with the increases averaging 4.5 percent and
2.2 percent, respectively.
   State and local government workers received on average a 4.8
percent pay gain in 1988, up from 4.2 percent in 1987, with the
increase in that sector highest among elementary and secondary
school employees, predominantly teachers, who averaged 5.7 percent
pay raises last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Higher, Stocks Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher Wednesday against the
Japanese yen, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
marginally, hitting another record high.
   The dollar closed at 127.65 yen, up 0.70 yen from Tuesdsay's
close of 126.95 yen. The currency opened higher at 127.86 yen, and
moved in a range of 127.37-127.88 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose to a
record high of 31,557.68 Tuesday, added 10.11 points, or 0.03
percent, to close at 31,567.79, a new high.
   The Nikkei posted early gains following similar climbs on
overseas markets overnight. It then due to investor concern over the
yen's weakness relative to the dollar and the index's rapid rise,
but remained slightly above Tuesday's close, traders said.
   In foreign exchange dealings, the dollar opened higher in the
wake of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to
Congress that indicated he may tighten monetary policy to fight
inflation.
   In a testimony Tuesday before the U.S. House of Representatives
Banking Committee, Greenspan said the risks of inflation were great
enough that the Federal Reserve ``might well be advised to err more
on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus.''
   Early trading was dominated by dollar-buying but speculative
investors started selling the currency to adjust their positions,
said Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank.
   ``We already knew that the United States would tighten its
monetary policy by keeping the interest rates high, but Greenspan's
comment still prompted buying because investors have been looking
for market-affecting incentives,'' he said.

   Combat veteran Jim Kessi is hoping that by
returning to Vietnam _ where most everyone in his battalion was
either wounded or killed _ he can exorcise the demons that still
haunt him after 20 years.
   ``Whenever I think of Vietnam ... I get real sad ... for the
people who were killed uselessly, both Vietnamese and American,''
said Kessi.
   ``If I go back and actually see the territory again _ that it is
different, that there isn't that big a bogeyman out there that will
cause the same thing to happen for my sons, maybe I can come to
peace with it.''
   Kessi, 43, seven other veterans, two group therapists and a
documentary film crew were to leave tonight for Vietnam. The
veterans will spend three weeks traveling through the country and
undergoing intensive psychiatric therapy.
   Kessi said guilt was a big problem when his one-year Army tour
was over.
   ``My first month in the field, my best friend from training
drowned with six other guys'' while patrolling a river in Vietnam,
Kessi said. ``When I got back 12 months later, I think I was the
only guy out of 18 guys signed to my battalion with me who wasn't
injured or dead.''
   Upon his return in January 1969, Kessi buried his memories and
built a succession of businesses, dabbling in construction, real
estate and commodities.
   ``I could build up something, do real well, and then destroy it.
Out of guilt,'' he said. ``I'm not supposed to be good. Why did I
survive and nobody else did?''
   Perhaps he will find some answers in Hanoi, the group's first
stop. From there, they will go through several other cities, mostly
by bus, ending up in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. They also
will visit the sites of some of the bloodiest battles of the war,
including Da Nang and the Mekong Delta area. Plans also include
meetings with Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army veterans.
   Dr. Ray Scurfield, director of the post-traumatic stress disorder
program at the Veterans Hospital at American Lake near Tacoma, will
accompany the group and conduct daily sessions.
   Scurfield, who did psychiatric work in Vietnam, said victims of
the disorder can develop chronic symptoms that include walking
nightmares, numbing, helplessness, fear that leads to rage, fear
that leads to grief, anger against authority and ``the system'' and
an inability to control emotions and actions.
   The disorder often responds to intensive therapy, he said.
   Bill Koutrouba, 46, who was an Army medic with three tours of
duty in Vietnam, came up with the idea for the trip following a
discussion about the Oscar-winning movie ``Platoon.''
   Koutrouba won three Silver Stars and was nominated for the Medal
of Honor. Now, he says, the disorder has left him disabled.
   Kessi enrolled in the program two years ago, and has been trying
to strip away his defenses to find out why he feels so isolated and
angry.
   ``I have no idea what it's going to be like when I get there,''
he said. ``I had promised some of my men, I was a sergeant, that I
would return in 20 years and take a tour of Vietnam. The feeling is
to pay homage to the people that weren't leaving. To our friends, to
our buddies.
   ``If I had one wish about this trip, it would be that I could
come back with less guilt, because I'm guilt-driven. And with less
sadness, and maybe with some reason why all those guys died.''

   The author of a revamped $2.5 billion child

administration will lead to passage of the legislation this year.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., said Tuesday that the Bush
administration's approach to child care is ``180 degrees different''
from the Reagan administration's positions.
   ``The American family, the children of this nation, were just
dealt about as good a political hand as any poker player could
want,'' said Dodd, citing the election of Bush and the new
leadership in Congress.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, gave a qualified endorsement to the
measure. ``We still have some differing views, but we agree that it
is time to address the growing concern of millions of American
families over the lack of affordable, quality child care,'' he said.

<NOTE>Petition Asks Broadening of Ford Pickup Fires Probe</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials have been asked by a
private advocacy group to order the recall of 1.9 million Ford Motor
Co. pickup trucks because they allegedly are prone to catch fire.
   The petition, filed Tuesday by the Center for Auto Safety, asked
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate
reports of fuel-system fires in Ford's F-series pickup trucks with
dual gas tanks made from 1983 through 1988.
   The center based its petition on eight reports of fires involving
F-series pickups, including a 1987 warehouse fire in Minot, S.D.,
allegedly started by a 1986 F-250 pickup whose fuel system caught
fire while unloading chemicals. Two people received serious burns,
according to reports received by the center.
   The advocacy group, often at odds with the auto industry and its
regulators, criticized as ``woefully inadequate'' a NHTSA
investigation of F-series pickups begun in December.

   Buoyed by signs of life, rescuers braved deadly
fumes today in an attempt to reach about 100 men believed sealed for
nearly five days in a gold mine by a deliberately set fire and a
collapse, officials said.
   ``Rescue teams have been working intensively through the night,''
Nazca police spokesman Juan Torres said early today in a telephone
interview.
   Three miners were found dead and three rescued Tuesday at the
mouth of the Sol de Oro mine near Nazca, 230 miles south of Lima.
   Energy Minister Jose Carrasco reported Tuesday that rescuers
heard tapping from the tunnels, indicating someone was alive. He
said rescuers ``tapped the walls and heard a faint response.''
   Carrasco said there were conflicting reports of 15 to 200 miners
trapped in the mine, which Nazca police Lt. Juan Robles said
collapsed Monday after a fire ravaged wooden tunnel supports.
   Rescuers reduced that number Tuesday to about 100. Robles said
the men have been trapped inside the mine since Saturday, when fire
prevented their escape.
   Carrasco told reporters on his return to Lima following a visit
to the mine site that opposing groups of miners set the fires during
a dispute. The state news agency Andina said miners were battling
over a newly discovered vein that was yielding about 4.5 pounds of
gold daily.
   Officials said fallen earth, smoke and poison gas had prevented
rescuers from entering the mine until Tuesday, when teams of
specialists from state mines and Lima reached the site.
   The fire started in the mine Friday after gas lamps used for
lighting set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the second level,
Robles said. That fire was controlled, he continued, but it flared
again on Saturday, and miners working inside were blocked from
leaving by heavy smoke.
   Robles said the miners were believed to be on the second, third
and fourth levels of the five-level mine, which extends about 1,000
feet into a half-mile-high hill on Nazca's outskirts.
   Officials said the mine had not been used commercially for about
a year, but area farmers and others have been mining it on an
independent basis for extra cash.
   Robles said about 900 men using mainly picks and shovels have
each extracted up to a gram of gold a day, valued at $10, for sale
to the state mining company Minero Peru.
   Carrasco said two of the rescued men had been hospitalized and a
third was only slightly injured.
   Robles said two of the three bodies recovered at the mouth of the
mine showed ``signs of having died from poison gases.''
   Mining is Peru's most important industry and accounts for more
than half of its foreign exchange. Gold production averages about
$60 million yearly and is the nation's fifth leading mineral behind
copper, silver, lead and zinc.

   Hamlet directed his players to speak ``trippingly
on the tongue,'' but the latest players to tackle another of
Shakespeare's tragic heroes, Othello, don't speak at all.
   ``Silent Othello,'' the latest production of the 4-year-old
Italian American Theater, tells the tale of the Moor of Venice
without the bard's poetry, and also without sets or secondary
characters.
   The five actors on the bare nightclub stage rely instead on mime,
dance motions and traditional Italian gestures _ most of them
impolite.
   ``We don't pretend it's Shakespeare, but you could consider it a
mirror to Shakespeare,'' director Frank Melcori recently said after
the first of six weekly performances.
   ``We don't have the verbal techniques to do spoken Shakespeare,
but we have other techniques we can use to tell a story,'' he said.
``Othello is the cleanest, dramatically, of Shakespeare's tragedies.
It's a fairly simple story of jealousy and revenge.''
   Even before Shakespeare's time, it was an Italian story: the tale
of how Otello Moro, the Venetian governor of Cyprus, was led by
misguided jealousy to strangle his wife, Desdemona.
   In ``Silent Othello,'' that jealousy is stage-managed, as in
Shakespeare, by the villainous Iago, but this time Iago is a woman,
Kaja Overstreet, the only cast member not of Italian ancestry. Ms.
Overstreet's training is in dance and Japanese theater, and she
dispenses with the subtleties of Shakespeare's Iago, creating
instead a demonic elf.
   ``Everything I've studied is very gestural,'' Ms. Overstreet
said. ``I'm very visual. I don't care about the delivery or
narrative.''
   Using the moves of the Buto theater she studied in Japan, Ms.
Overstreet establishes Iago's villainy at the outset with the mere
lighting of a cigarette. Later, with snakelike motions, she puts the
horns of the deceived husband on Othello in the very act of
``consoling'' him.
   Gino DeGrazia, as Othello, uses restrained movements through most
of the 40-minute performance to suggest a dignified Venetian
general. But after strangling Desdemona, played by Laura Dame, he
reverts to his African heritage, smearing himself with her lipstick
and doing a voodoo-inspired dance before committing suicide.
   Lionel Bottari, who plays the double role of Roderigo and
Brabantio, said the production was based largely on the ideas of
Dario Fo, a contemporary playwright and comedian who draws on the
traditions of Italian folk comedy.
   ``We're attempting to create an Italian-American kind of cultural
entity,'' said Bottari, who has been performing in ``guerrilla
theater'' since the 1960s. ``Italian-Americans have arrived
economically and politically, but we haven't really arrived at the
level of culture our families left behind.''

   President Bush and his wife Barbara
were among the first to congratulate President Corazon Aquino on her
56th birthday today, the Philippine president said.
   ``President Bush also told me that in case I need anything in the
future, I should not hesitate to call him up immediately,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino told well-wishers that Bush's telephone call at 7
a.m. delayed her arrival at the Roman Catholic cathedral in this
provincial capital for a Mass to mark the occasion.
   The conversation with the Bushes was briefly interrupted because
``the line was cut and I had to wait for (Bush) to call again,''
Mrs. Aquino said.
   She joked that perhaps the fault was with the Philippine Long
Distance Co., which is run by a branch of her family and is
notorious for its poor service.
   Mrs. Aquino decided to celebrate her birthday by taking her
entire Cabinet to Malolos, capital of Bulacan province 20 miles
north of Manila, to listen to residents' complaints and problems and

<HEAD>Five Faulty MX Missiles Found, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force removed the 10-warhead payload
from five MX missiles late last year, several months after an
accident in which a missile came loose and fell in its underground
silo, a published report says.
   The service is still trying to decide how to repair the five
missiles, which account for 10 percent of the nation's MX force, The
Washington Post reported today.
   Despite taking the warheads off five missiles, the service still
claimed last month that the MX had reached ``full operational
capability'' on Dec. 30.
   The decision to remove the warheads followed an incident last
June in Wyoming. According to the newspaper, one of the missiles
became ``unglued'' from its underground launch canister.
   The missile fell six inches to a foot and had to undergo
extensive repairs, the Post said, quoting unnamed Air Force
officials.
   An Air Force investigating panel concluded that the missile was
one of a batch of five which had production problems, the Post said.
   Air Force officials responded to the report by ordering removal
of the 10-warhead package atop each of the five suspect missiles,
according to the newspaper.
   The Air Force has been authorized to build 50 of the missiles and
deploy them in underground silos in Wyoming and Nebraska. The weapon
will join the Minuteman as the core of the nation's land-based
nuclear missile deterrent force.
   The Air Force has not publicly released details of the two
incidents and Pentagon officials contacted Tuesday night said they
had no information on them.
   In the incident last June, a key electrical wire was cut. The
wire is normally severed during launch and may have briefly caused
concern that the weapon was being launched, the Post said. But
Pentagon officials told the newspaper there was no danger of an
accidental launch.

   Records of American troop movements in Vietnam
prove that thousands of soldiers were in areas heavily sprayed by
the herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s, according to two scientists
whose methods are heavily criticized by the government, a published
report says.
   The findings by Steven and Jeanne Stellman that thousands of
troops were exposed to the cancer-causing herbicide challenge
statements by federal officials that they have been unable to find
enough soldiers exposed to heavy spraying to reach any meaningful
conclusions.
   The two epidemiologists planned to present their findings today
to Congress, The Washington Post reported today.
   Twelve million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed in Vietnam
from 1965 to 1970 to defoliate jungles and cropland where enemy
troops were thought to be hiding. The herbicide contains dioxin, the
most toxic chemical known. A tiny amount of dioxin causes cancer,
immune system depression and birth defects in laboratory animals.
   The Stellmans found that half the 35 combat battalions they have
examined so far were in areas near Saigon during or soon after the
time Agent Orange was sprayed in the 1967 and 1968.
   They said the evidence of exposure is so strong that veterans
should be contacted, checked for health effects and informed of
possible future problems.
   ``When I look at those levels of exposure, I get a lump in my
throat,'' the Post quoted Jeanne Stellman, an associate professor of
public health at Columbia University. ``We have several units that
were right in the midst of very heavy spraying.''
   Her husband, Steven Stellman, an assistant health commissioner in
New York City, said, ``Those men are at higher risk for a variety of
health problems.''
   But Vernon C. Houk, director of the Center for Environmental
Health at the Centers for Disease Control, said the Stellmans were
``turning logic on its head'' by ignoring blood tests in favor of
historical records.
   The Stellmans said blood analysis such as those used by the CDC
are not a valid measure of dioxin 20 years after exposure.

   Ten Tibetan monks have begun a month-long project
that brings an ancient Buddhist tradition to the West: butter
sculpture.
   No, not the statue of a cow they had at the state fair, and not
the carved swan you once saw on a banquet table.
   These sculptures, begun Tuesday in an unheated hall at the
American Museum of Natural History, are astonishingly intricate,
brightly colored religious offerings, created in a ritualistic
manner that dates back more than six centuries.
   ``We devote ourselves to this way of life, which is now under
great stress,'' said one of the monks, Thubten Jigme, after he
carried a tub of ice water to the demonstration area. ``We're
delighted to let people know about our culture and our art.''
   Organizers with the museum and Tibet House New York say it's the
first time large-scale traditional butter sculpture has been shown
in the West.
   Wearing bright yellow and red robes, the monks began their work
with several minutes of distinctive harmonic chanting. Individual
voices somehow produced three-tone chords and the chorus of 10
sounded at once ominous and soothing.
   Then, to work.
   The men from the Gyuto Tantric Monastery in Bomdila, India, will
stay in a private home for the next six weeks, rising before dawn to
chant for hours, then settling in to work on the sculptures from
10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   They create individual pie-sized pieces of art _ abstract
flowers, concentric designs called mandalas and other symbols _ as
well as miniature sculptures of horses, elephants and six-armed
figures called Mahakalas.
   These will be attached to an 8-foot wooden frame, all to show
Americans how the Tibetan monks celebrate the new year in February.
   The ``butter'' is actually a vegetable product _ the preferred
yak butter is virtually unavailable _ refined from the seeds of a
certain species of tree that grows in northern India.
   Konchok Wangdu, abbot of the monastery, said he hoped the
demonstration will encourage Americans ``to learn extensively about
Tibet, her history, her culture and her art.''
   ``Because of the Chinese occupation of the past 30 years, these
arts have been extinguished, and those people who do them are
becoming extinct,'' he said. More than 100,000 Tibetans fled their
homeland and Chinese domination in 1959.

   Hours before his execution, Ted Bundy coolly
traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood
glimpses of violent pornography became ``an addiction'' that grew
until his ``destructive energy'' exploded from fantasy into reality.
   The 42-year-old law school dropout, whose bizarre mixture of
intelligence, charm and homicidal bloodlust were the subject of five
books and a TV movie, also warned before his execution Tuesday that
there were others like himself.
   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people like
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,
by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' Bundy
said in a videotaped interview Monday.
   Bundy, who after a decade of denial told detectives from four
states that he had murdered 23 young women since the mid-1970s, said
he deserved his punishment. His execution in the electric chair at
Florida State Prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people who
stood in a field across from the penitentiary.
   ``I don't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... (but) I
deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,''
Bundy said in the interview with James Dobson, a religious
broadcaster and psychologist.
   He said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to
protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography, TV
violence, X-rated movies.
   Although he said he felt remorse for the sex-related murders,
which authorities believes could total 36 nationwide, Bundy said,
``There is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore
those beautiful children to their parents.''
   Handcuffed and sitting at a table across from Dobson, Bundy
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29-minute interview. He was
dressed in the peach-colored, short-sleeved shirt worn by Death Row
inmates.
   He appeared to ponder each question carefully, sometimes pausing
at length before answering articulately.
   Dobson, who has a daily radio program heard on 1,200 radio
stations, asked about the rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach, for which Bundy was executed.
   ``What did you feel after that?'' Dobson asked.
   Bundy held his hands to his face, closed his eyes and thought for
a long time before responding: ``I can't talk about that right now.
... It's too painful . ... I can't begin to understand the pain that
the parents of these children (felt).
   ``I don't ask them to forgive me. I'm not asking for it. That
kind of forgiveness is of God.''
   Prodded by Dobson to explore the sources of his violence, Bundy
said that during his murder rampages ``the unique thing about how
this worked ... is I still felt in my regular life the full range of
guilt and remorse about other things.''
   But the murders, he said, were ``compartmentalized'' in his
brain, a ``very well focused, very sharply focused area that was a
black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that
crack hole just disappeared.''
   He emphasized he didn't blame pornography for his actions and
took full responsibility. But he said hard-core pornography, fueled
by alcohol, ``guided and shaped'' what he did.
   ``I have lived in prison for a long time now, and I've met a lot
of men who were motivated to violence just like me. And without
exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography,''
he said.
   Claiming he was ``essentially a normal person'' who grew up in a
good home, Bundy said:
   ``People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have
been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular
pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular
families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any
house today.''
   But Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a psychiatrist who examined Bundy as
part of a last-ditch attempt to save him from execution, said
Bundy's first home was that of his maternal grandparents, with a
grandfather who was ``an extremely violent and frightening
individual.'' The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their
tails, beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously,
the New Haven, Conn., psychiatrist said.
   Lewis said a cousin told her that when Bundy was a preschooler in
the home in Philadelphia, he used to sneak into a greenhouse where
his grandfather's pornography was kept and read it.
   In the interview, Bundy said his desire to murder ``happened in
stages, gradually. ... Once you become addicted to (pornography),
and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of
addiction, I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more
graphic kinds of material.
   ``You keep craving something that is harder, harder, something
which, which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you
reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that
jumping-off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing
it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at
it.
   ``In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process, then at
a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say crystallizing,
making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside.
... a building up of this destructive energy.''
   After committing his first murder, Bundy said, he was
``absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something like
that.''
   ``It was like coming out of some horrible trance,'' Bundy said.
``It was like being possessed by something so awful, so alien.
   ``But then the impulse to do it again would come back even
stronger.''

<HEAD>Amnesty International Criticizes East German Human Rights Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Persistent human rights abuses by East Germany
include the punishment of people who seek to emigrate, harsh
treatment of prisoners and the conducting of secret trials, Amnesty
International said today.
   While the Communist government has loosened up some travel
restrictions, some people caught trying to flee have been charged
with espionage, the London-based human rights organization said.
   Amnesty said ``a clear pattern of human rights abuse'' exists in
the country of 16.6 million people but said official secrecy and the
government's refusal to respond in detail to various allegations
make it difficult to obtain a complete picture.
   Western leaders last week sharply criticized East Germany's
record on the issue during a human rights conference in Vienna.
   East German leader Erich Honecker has been resisting calls for
reforms along the lines of those initiated in the Soviet Union by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Amnesty said East Germany's ``secret trials, secret directives to
lawyers and vaguely defined laws make it possible for the
authorities to penalize almost any activity of which they
disapprove.''
   Young East Germans, with the support of part of the Lutheran
Church, have been clamoring for greater freedom, including the
ability to travel outside the Soviet bloc.
   Amnesty quoted some East Germans as saying their applications to
emigrate were turned down because the stated reasons were ``not
sufficient.''
   ``Others have reported that the officials said that the
application was `illegal' without indicating which laws had been
broken,'' the organization said in a report.
   The East Germans have eased travel restrictions after years of
pressure from Western leaders. Western estimates say 1.5 million
people have applied to emigrate from East Germany. Many leave
illegally _ more than 9,700 in 1988.
   Amnesty said there have been cases of people being charged with
espionage if they had access to ``sensitive information'' and later
tried to flee.
   ``In such cases, no information has in fact been passed on
because the person was apprehended before this was possible,'' said
report says.
   It notes that stating one's reasons for wishing to leave East
Germany can be considered the crime of ``public vilification.''
   ``The `vilification' is considered public if, for example, a copy
of the application for an exit visa is sent to a higher authority or
written on a postcard,'' Amnesty said.
   Many of those persecuted by the government are would-be emigrants
who later turn to foreign organizations in hopes of seeking
attention for their case, the report says.
   It says potential witnesses and defense lawyers can be charged
with crimes if they challenge the prosecutor's version of facts in a
case.
   Amnesty said there were also reports of mistreatment in jail.
   ``One former prisoner complained that the only person she could
talk to immediately after arrest was her interrogator and that she
almost began to look forward to the daily interrogation sessions as
a break from the monotony of isolation in the cell,'' the report
says.
   ``A number of former prisoners have reported that inmates in
punishment cells were chained to beds for days on end as punishment,
being set free only to go to the toilet or for meals,'' Amnesty
reported.
   Refusal to work was the most common reason for confinement in a
punishment cell, a drafty, 6{-foot-by-6{-foot area.

<HEAD>DOE Criticizes Savannah River Operators Following New Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say an accident that
occurred during testing at the Savannah River Plant is another sign
that problems at the nuclear facility are out of control.
   ``The issue is not physical damage. The issue is a lack of
formality, a lack of discipline,'' Richard Starostecki, deputy
assistant energy secretary, said Tuesday. ``This doesn't give you
confidence in their ability to handle anomalies.''
   The Engergy Department and Du Pont Co., the plant's operator, are
investigating Sunday's accident. Federal officials said there was no
leakage of radiation or other hazardous material.
   Du Pont officials said damage has tentatively been estimated at
$20,000 and will take only a few days to repair.
   The Savannah River Plant reactors, which produce plutonium and
tritium for the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal, have been shut
down since April for safety and maintenance reasons.
   The impact of the accident on the department's plans to restart
the reactor before the end of this summer is uncertain.
   However, DOE safety officials say the incident, which comes at a
time when safety of the nation's nuclear weapons complex is under
intense congressional scrutiny, casts new doubts on the ability of
plant operators to run SRP's three nuclear reactors.
   Starostecki, the DOE's top safety official, said the incident was
further evidence that suggested ``a lack of control over what's
going on in the reactors.''
   He said the mishap at the K reactor closely parallels earlier
problems at the P reactor in August, when operators failed to shut
down the reactor when they were confronted with erratic power levels.
   The latest problem began Thursday with a test of a portion of the
reactor system that uses water from the nearby Savannah River to
help keep the radioactive core cool during normal operations.
   During the test, operators opened a valve to divert water from
one segment of the cooling system to the portion being tested,
according to Gerald Merz, Du Pont's technology superintendent. Merz
said problems began when the operators forgot to close the valve
after the test.
   Unaware that the valve was still open, other operators on Sunday
began a test of another portion of the cooling system. When water
pressure in the portion of the cooling system they were testing
failed to increase as expected, they incorrectly assumed the problem
was inadequate pumping capacity.
   Merz said the operators then switched on a second pump, which
created enough force to break the valve. He said that caused water
to surge through the entire system at up to six times the normal
pressure level.
   ``Rather than take a prudent course of action when they weren't
getting the numbers they expected during a test, which would have
been to stop the test, somebody elected to turn on another pump,''
Starostecki said.
   Du Pont officials ordered a halt to further maintenance and
testing at the K reactor. The Energy Department says that work must
be conducted before a restart can be attempted.
   Merz said the company's initial investigation suggests that
operators failed to explicitly instruct technicians to close the
valve in question after the test Thursday.
   But Merz, Starostecki and Roger Rollins, DOE's acting director
for reactor assessment at SRP, said Tuesday that the faulty decision
by operators during the Sunday test was a bigger mistake.
   ``They should have stopped,'' Merz said. ``They were seeing
something different than what was expected as far as the pressure
levels, and the correct action would have been to halt the test and
call in the engineers and figure out what was happening.''
   He said Du Pont is considering taking disciplinary action against
the operators involved.
   Rollins said the DOE is investigating the matter, including a
delay in reporting the problem to top plant officials. He said word
of the mishap Sunday night did not reach the department's managers
at Savannah River until Tuesday.

   A Soviet-American dog sledding team plans to make
a 1,200-mile goodwill trek across the Bering Strait, the first
officially sanctioned crossing since 1948.
   Ten men and two women _ six Soviets and six Americans _ will
depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on the two-month journey,
visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route.
   ``Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,'' so
the visits could get emotional, said expedition co-leader Paul
Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis.
   The expedition is an effort to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region,
Schurke said at a news conference Tuesday at the swanky Russian Tea
Room restaurant.
   And since villagers in the remote region rarely get out-of-town
visitors, he said, they are expecting big welcomes, especially from
children who will probably get the day off from school to ski along
with the team.
   The Soviet co-leader is Dmitry Shparo, 47, of Moscow, who in 1979
won his country's highest honor, the Order of Lenin, for
successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole. Last year,
he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the polar ice cap
from the USSR to Canada.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, called the Bering Bridge
Expedition ``another step toward melting the ice curtain.''
   Murkowski, who attended Tuesday's news conference, noted that the
U.S. government is working on a treaty with the Soviets to permit
American Eskimos to visit and trade with their counterparts in
Siberia without visas.
   In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that enabled
travel in the Bering region, but it was abrogated in 1948 during the
iciest days of the Cold War.
   In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border
around April 1.
   ``When you're only 2{ miles from your neighbor, it shouldn't take
40 years to renew your relationship,'' said Murkowski, referring to
the narrow strait between the islands of Big Diomede and Little
Diomede, the narrowest distance between the superpowers.
   ``The Bering Strait is the shortest distance between the two
greatest powers in the world,'' said Schurke, who made an unassisted
trek to the North Pole in 1986.
   ``Yet it remains a cold reminder of untapped potential for
exchange. We are looking forward to setting an example for the world
and uniting a people too long divided.''

<TEXT>
   Reputed mob boss John Gotti, who according to his
attorney ``has never run away from a problem,'' walked out of a
courtroom free on bail after being accused of ordering the shooting
of a construction union official.
   ``Did I ever worry yet?'' a smiling Gotti asked reporters waiting
for him as he arrived back at his home 20 hours after being arrested
by dozens of law officers on a street in Little Italy.
   ``I have nothing to worry about.''
   At a bail hearing Tuesday, the prosecution asked that Gotti be
held without bail, arguing that the reputed head of the Gambino
crime family had access to massive sums of mob money and would flee
if freed.
   Gotti's income is ``literally that of the family,'' Assistant
District Attorney Michael Cherkasky told acting Judge George Roberts.
   ``His financial resources are enormous. He's gambled on numerous
occasions and lost enormous sums of money. We're counting in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Cherkasky said.
   But Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, said Gotti has strong family
ties here and had never failed to appear for a court date.
   ``He's not going no place. He has never run away from a
problem,'' Cutler said.
   Roberts set Gotti's bail at $100,000, and about an hour later the
48-year-old Gotti _ dressed in the same tailored brown suit and
yellow turtleneck he wore when he was arrested Monday _ was back on
the streets.
   At a news conference Tuesday, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
released a grand jury indictment that accused Gotti and two
associates of conspiring to order the shooting of John F. O'Connor,
who allegedly had a restaurant vandalized for using non-union
carpenters.
   ``It was the specific goal and intention of the conspiracy to
punish John F. O'Connor, and thereby reaffirm the authority of the
Gambino crime family over all others who might challenge it,''
according to the indictment, which charges Gotti and the other two
men with conspiracy and first-degree assault.
   O'Connor, vice president and business manager of Local 608 of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, was shot four times in
the May 1986 attack, but survived.
   Law enforcement officials said O'Connor apparently did not know
the restaurant, Bankers and Brokers in lower Manhattan, was managed
by an alleged associate of the Gambino organization, the nation's
most powerful crime family.
   Gotti codefendant Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri, 60, a reputed
soldier in Gotti's organization, was freed on $50,000 bail. Both men
pleaded innocent.
   The judge ordered the two to return to court Monday.
   The third man indicted, Angelo Ruggiero, identified as a captain
in the Gambino family, was placed in custody at a hospital where he
is undergoing cancer treatment, and will be arraigned later,
Morgenthau said.
   Morgenthau said investigators learned through electronic
surveillance that a contract to shoot O'Connor had been given by the
Gambino group to the leader of the Westies, a gang that operated on
Manhattan's West Side.
   Several members of the Westies were named as co-conspirators in
the indictment, but were not charged.
   A missing member of the gang, Kevin Kelly, was indicted in
absentia in September 1986 on attempted murder charges for the
O'Connor shooting. Law-enforcement officials believe Kelly has been
killed.

<TEXT>
   African students who want to leave China because
they say the Chinese are racist asked the president of the
Organization of African Unity today for money to pursue their
studies elsewhere.
   Mali President Moussa Traore, who heads the OAU, arrived in
Beijing on Tuesday for his third visit since 1973 and was met at the
airport by a delegation of Malian students from universities around
China.
   Traore was given a letter asking him to help African students
leave China, the African students said. The OAU has recently
criticized China for its treatment of African students.
   ``African students feel menaced by a climate of insecurity which
is implicitly encouraged by Chinese authorities,'' said a copy of
the letter obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``We would like to leave China not only with the aim of returning
to our respective countries but with an aim of continuing our
studies in countries where living conditions will be favorable,''
the letter says.
   It asks the OAU to provide the students with scholarships ``to
enable us continue our studies.''
   Most of the 1,500 African students in China are on Chinese
government scholarships. It was not clear how many of them the
letter represented.
   Telephone calls to the Mali Embassy for comment were not answered.
   A brawl on Dec. 24 at a university in Nanking triggered
anti-African protests by Chinese in several cities and attacks on
African students' dormitories in that city.
   Today, about 500 Africans continued a class boycott that began
Jan. 4 at the Beijing Languages Institute and about half the 140
African students in Nanking remained on strike there.
   Chinese authorities on Tuesday released Alex Dosoo of Ghana, the
last of three African students arrested in Nanking for allegedly
taking part in the Christmas Eve brawl. Dosoo had been under house
arrest at a guest house in Nanking for 11 days and in jail the
previous two weeks.
   In a telephone interview from Nanking, Dosoo said Chinese
authorities told him he could continue his studies in China. He said
he would rather return home.
   Ghana protested Dosoo's arrest and threatened to withdraw its 26
students from China. Most of the other African embassies have been
silent on the issue.
   Dosoo's release appeared aimed at lessening any problems China
might have with Traore during his visit. China has long courted
Africa in its attempt to be a leader of the Third World.
   An official Xinhua News Agency report on Traore's visit late
tonight stressed China's strong ties to Africa.
   ``Strengthening cooperation with Third World nations, including
those of Africa, is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy of
independence and peace,'' Xinhua said.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of middle-age rock 'n' roll
fans, insisting that'll be the day when they forget Buddy Holly,
will converge next month at the ballroom where he performed his last
concert three decades ago.
   ``You can forget about the federal deficit, crime or whatever
bothers people the rest of the year,'' said Darryl Hensley, who has
taken the annual event from a money-losing spoof to a sold-out
attraction.
   ``They got wife problems? Kid problems? They come here and
they're 18 again, and they have no problems. And you know they want
to come. Hey, this isn't Phoenix, Arizona. This is Clear Lake, Iowa,
in winter,'' Hensley said.
   This year's concert is scheduled for Feb. 3-4 at the Surf
Ballroom in Clear Lake, where Holly performed his last concert
before he died in a plane crash.
   As usual, all 1,600 tickets have been sold for months. The 400
others are controlled by the ballroom, a radio station and Hensley,
with many reserved for performers, press and security.
   After their concert 30 years ago, Holly and fellow rockers J.P.
``Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens decided to fly to their
next gig rather than take the tour bus. Their small chartered plane
crashed into a frozen field shortly after takeoff. There were no
survivors.
   Hensley, a radio personality whose on-air name is the Mad Hatter,
said there are no special plans for this year's concert. Holly's
relatives have attended before, but none has accepted invitations
this year.
   Hensley, who owns KDWD in Burlington, said this year's activities
begin Feb. 3 with an all-night sock hop featuring '50s and '60s
favorites.
   The next night, Bobby Vee, the Diamonds and Freddy ``Boom Boom''
Cannon will re-create their hits, along with warm-up groups the
Rockin' Ricochettes of Minneapolis and Bill Dewey and the Blazing
Broncos of Clear Lake. The $45 ticket provides admission to both
nights.
   Hensley first was host of the concert as a radio personality and
owner of KZEV radio in Clear Lake, now owned by his ex-wife, Diane.
   ``I was just doing a spoof on the radio show,'' he said. ``I was
brand new in Iowa, and I explained that we had built the studio by
mistake in a time warp. Buddy and Elvis talked to me each morning.
... Buddy thought it was strange that nobody put on a concert in his
memory, and Elvis said, `Yeah, man, we got to do this for Buddy.'
   ``Then some guy from AP called and asked if I was really going to
do it. So we did,'' he said.
   ``People from 30 to 50 or 60, they're reliving 1959. Don McLean
wrote that song (``American Pie'') about the day the music died. I
think he was premature,'' said Hensley. ``Buddy Holly is still
living today, bigger and better than ever.''

<HEAD>Eight Arrested In Wenceslas Square Face Charges Of Hooliganism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Czech activists who were arrested
last week while trying to place flowers on Prague's Wenceslas Square
face charges of disturbing the public and hooliganism, an informed
source said today.
   Prominent playwright Vaclav Havel and 15 others were detained
after the eight tried to lay flowers in memory of Jan Palach, a
student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest the death
of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms after the Soviet-led invasion of
1968.
   Five of that group were released last weekend but may also be
tried, dissidents in Prague said this week.
   Havel, like the other eight still in prison, will likely be
prosecuted separately, said the source, who was reached by telephone
from Vienna.
   The source, who asked not to be identified, said the lawyers of
the eight accused dissidents were summoned to the prison Tuesday and
informed of the results of a police probe.
   Under Czechoslovak law, both the accused and their lawyers must
be informed of the outcome of such an investigation before the
charges are presented to the public prosecutor.
   According to the source, if convicted they face a maximum penalty
of two years in prison.
   The eight were identified as Dana Nemcova and Sasha Vondra,
spokesmen for the Charter 77 human rights group, Stanislav Penc,
Jana Petrova, Otakar Veverka of Independent Peace Association, Jana
Sternova, also a senior Charter 77 member, as well as Petr Placak
and David Nemec of the Czech Children group.
   Two other people arrested on Jan. 16, Jitka Vavsikova and Jiri
Fiala, have not been heard of since, and it was not clear if they
are still under arrest, said sources in Prague and Vienna.
   In addition to hooliganism, Havel also faces additional charges
for having called for an unauthorized demonstration in interviews
with foreign media Jan. 9-15, the source in Vienna said.

<HEAD>2,000 Brewery Workers Face Layoffs In Merger Of Carling-Molson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven breweries employing at least 2,000 Canadians
will be shut down under the proposed merger of Carling O'Keefe and
Molson's, a newspaper reported today.
   The Molson brewery in Toronto and Carling's Montreal plant are
chief among the victims, the Toronto Star quoted industry sources as
saying.
   The sources told the newspaper the new brewing company also will
close Carling operations in St. John's, Newfoundland; Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan; and Vancouver, British Columbia. Molson facilities
will close in Lethbridge, Alberta, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, the
newspaper said.
   Molson Breweries is the name of the new company formed by last
week's merger of the second- and third-largest breweries in Canada.
   The merger still needs approval from the federal Bureau of
Competition Policy. Approval is expected.
   The companies said they would close one plant in every province
where both have operations to become more efficient in a bid at
cracking the giant U.S. beer market.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist: Bundy's Mental Problems May Have Dated From Infancy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bundy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist who examined Ted Bundy as part of a
last-ditch attempt to save him from execution concluded that the
confessed serial killer probably started developing psychological
problems as an infant.
   Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, of New Haven, Conn., said Bundy first
lived in the home of his maternal grandparents in Philadelphia, with
a grandfather who was ``an extremely violent and frightening
individual.''
   The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their tails, beat
people who angered him and read pornography voraciously, she said.
   Lewis interviewed Bundy on Monday as his attorneys tried
unsuccessfully to prove he was mentally incompetent to be executed.
Bundy was electrocuted Tuesday morning at the Florida State Prison.
   Lewis' findings were published in detail in Tuesday editions of
the Seattle Times, offering a possible glimpse into the mind of a
man linked to as many as three dozen killings in the West and in
Florida. In the days before he died, Bundy confessed to 23 deaths.
   Lewis said a cousin told her that when Bundy was a preschooler,
he used to sneak into a greenhouse where his grandfather's
pornography was kept and read it. Hours before his death, Bundy, 42,
said that pornography fueled his violent thoughts toward women.
   Bundy exhibited bizarre behavior at his grandparents' house, the
psychiatrist said. At age 3, he appeared several times at the
bedside of his 15-year-old aunt, lifting the covers and placing
butcher knives beside her.
   Lewis said Bundy's maternal grandmother had been hospitalized
more than once for psychotic depression and had undergone
electroshock therapy. Later in life, the woman had a severe phobia
against leaving her house.
   Such things could indicate Bundy had a genetic predisposition to
mental illness, Lewis said.
   ``The whole family felt that (Bundy's mother) Louise Bundy and
her son had to be rescued from the home,'' a family member told
Lewis.
   In the interviews with Lewis, Ted Bundy repeatedly said he had
only fond memories of his grandfather, apparently blocking out
incidents described by other family members and indicating to Lewis
that Bundy had been ``horribly traumatized'' as a child.
   She said Bundy, born Theodore Robert Cowell in a Burlington, Vt.,
home for unwed mothers, finally moved with his mother to Tacoma,
where other relatives lived. There, his mother met and married John
Bundy, a hospital cook, and John adopted Ted.
   Lewis determined Bundy suffered from a ``bipolar mood disorder,''
or a manic-depressive illness that produced violent mood swings in
the convicted killer. At a moment's notice, Bundy could switch from
euphoria and compulsive talking to anger followed by long periods of
sullen silence, she said.
   Bundy almost certainly suffered from this disorder at the time of
his Florida trials for killing two Florida State University women in
Tallahassee, and 12-year-old Kimberly Leach in Lake City. Bundy was
executed for the latter crime.
   As evidence of Bundy's mood swings, Lewis showed the court a
doodle she found in one of Bundy's college notebooks. It showed two
faces: one normal, the other enlarged and with Dracula-like teeth.
   Lewis said Bundy not only didn't recall the doodle, he tried to
explain it away by saying he was probably on drugs when it was drawn.
   An example of Bundy's mood swings occurred when an investigator
was in Bundy's cell in Florida, Lewis said. The investigator told
her that during a normal conversation, Bundy suddenly ``became weird
on me ... did a metamorphosis, a bit of a body and facial change,
and ... almost an odor emitted from him.''
   The investigator said the incident lasted about 20 minutes,
during which there was a ``change of personality with extreme
tension ... I was afraid of him ... it was very scary.''
   On the day the Leach girl's body was found, Bundy flew into a
rage in his cell, Lewis said. ``He was pacing ... muttering things
... hyperventilating.''
   U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp, who heard Lewis' findings,
also heard some strong dissent.
   Dr. G. Jorgenson, a University of Utah psychiatrist who talked
with Bundy in a Utah jail in 1976, described Bundy's hostility as
``mild.'' He said Bundy was ``intellectually efficient and
flexible,'' had a good relationship with women and was a ``normal
person.''
   Dr. Charles B. Mutter, a Miami physician specializing in
psychiatry, also said Bundy was sane.
   ``I think what this man did is brilliant,'' Mutter said in
describing the meticulous research Bundy performed in taking 80 or
90 depositions during one of his trials.
   Bundy, said Mutter, was ``very logical, very lucid. He has beat
two death warrants. Is that insanity?''

   The Mirage 2000 fighter, flying at about 430 m.p.h., hit the lift

<HEAD>Jewish Civil Rights Group Backs Teaching `Values' in School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Jewish organization is calling for the
renewed teaching of values in American schools, saying there's more
cause for concern over moral confusion than over potential
church-state conflicts.
   A report by the American Jewish Committee says the organization
has rejected the argument that values education could be ``a
smokescreen for teaching religious precepts.''
   The AJC, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, is
encouraging schools to define, teach ``and put into action'' values
that are at the foundation of a democracy.
   ``You've got to rely on good faith and the integrity of the
teaching system,'' said Arnold Gardner, the organization's vice
president and chairman of the task force that wrote the report.
   ``The easiest thing to do is (to say) let's not touch it because
it's too risky,'' Gardner said. ``I think it's a natural evolution
of our attitude and the ability to distinguish between matters of
religious faith and shared values.''
   The report, to be released next month, is considered significant
because of the past reluctance of many groups representing minority
religions to enter into the issue. A copy of the report was obtained
by The Associated Press.
   Marilyn Braveman, the committee's director of education, said she
thinks the report could have been written two years ago, ``but it
wouldn't be received as well. There might not be a sense of urgency
in it.''
   The role of the public school in teaching values is coming under
increasing scrutiny as educators and others debate the effect of
``value-free education.'' In a 1986 speech that focused national
attention on the issue, Gov. Mario Cuomo said, ``When you get kids
for eight years in an elementary school and you never say anything
to them about values, I suspect what you're saying to them is there
are no values.''
   A panel of educators brought together by the Association of
Supervision and Curriculum Development recommended in its final
report last year ``that schools define and teach a morality of
justice, altruism, diligence and respect for human dignity.''
   The National Council of Churches, representing main-line
Protestant denominations, last year launched an experimental program
to bring together churches, schools and teacher-education colleges
to help communities establish a consensus on values that should be
taught.
   ``I think what happened over the last 20 years ... was a certain
kind of moral relativism did enter in. There was confusion about
right and wrong,'' said Irving M. Levine, the Jewish committee's
director of national affairs.
   ``What you have now is a reinsertion of the
ethno-cultural-religious traditions and an attempt to develop a
consensus around those traditional values.''
   The committee's report said that in many cases, religious and
civic values are identical. Among these are compassion, a regard for
human worth and dignity, integrity and justice. The report said a
non-sectarian consensus can be reached on what values should be
taught.
   ``You don't have enormous controversy over those values. You have
enormous controversy over opening a foot in the door for sectarian
religion,'' Levine said.
   Methods the report suggests for introducing values in the
classroom include a ``conflict corner'' where two students could
work out their differences and a teacher-moderated ``fairness
committee'' to propose solutions to classroom problems.
   Ms. Braveman gave one example of how values can be taught. She
told of a second-grade teacher whose class was incubating 20 chicken
eggs for a science project, and suggested opening an egg each week
to monitor the eggs' embryonic development.
   When one student told the teacher privately that he thought it
was cruel to kill the chicks, the teacher brought the issue to the
class. After a debate about whether chickens were alive before they
hatched, whether curiosity was a good enough reason to kill a chick
and whether the scientific value of the experiment warranted opening
the eggs, the pupils agreed to honor their classmate's objections.
   The old fear that teaching values would lead to teaching
sectarian religious beliefs still is prevalent in the American
Jewish community, Ms. Braveman said, but that is no longer the
exclusive position. ``There's a desperate sense we need to do
something,'' she said.
   The 50,000-member American Jewish Committee, based in New York,
aims to protect the civil rights of Jews worldwide.

<HEAD>Board Expedites Parole Review for Adams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Pardons and Paroles will
give quicker consideration of parole for a man whose 1976 conviction
for killing a Dallas police officer was questioned in the movie
``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``I would speculate it would be within the next 30 days,'' said
Glenn T. Heckmann, the board's executive director.
   The board on Tuesday granted Randall Dale Adams an expedited
parole review, meaning his December review would be moved up.
   State records show Adams, 40, who is serving a life sentence, has
been denied parole eight times, most recently on Jan. 10.
   Adams' parole request was expedited based on information provided
by State District Judge Larry Baraka, said Karin Armstrong, an
information officer with the board.
   Baraka last month ruled that Adams did not receive a fair trial
in 1977 and recommended he be granted a new one or set free.
   The key witness against Adams changed his story last month,
testifying that Adams didn't commit the murder and wasn't even in
the car police officer Robert Wood stopped just before he was gunned
down.
   However, the witness, David Ray Harris, stopped short of saying
he pulled the trigger himself in Wood's slaying.
   Harris is on Death Row for another killing, and Dallas district
attorney John Vance has discounted his testimony.
   Adams, always maintaining his innocence, contends prosecutors
wanted to convict him rather than Harris, who was only 16 at the
time. If convicted as a juvenile, Harris would have been released at
age 18.
   ``The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary by Errol Morris, questioned
Adams' guilt.
   Adams has served more than 12 years in state prison. In 1980, his
death sentence was commuted to life.
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also is considering Baraka's
recommendation that Adams be given a new trial or set free.
Attorneys said it could take as long as two years to act on it.

<TEXT>
   The pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia has
signed an agreement with the U.N. refugee agency to allow Cambodian
refugees to return home from camps along the Thai border, state
radio reported today.
   An official Cambodian government broadcast said the agreement,
signed Monday in Phnom Penh, deals with ``principles and procedures
to welcome back voluntarily repatriated Cambodian refugees.''
   ``The memorandum has been signed and the UNHCR (U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees) would be ready to facilitate Cambodian
refugees who ... wish to return,'' said a U.N. refugee agency
official in Bangkok, Kaiser Zaman.
   Only about 17,000 of the quarter-million Cambodians along the
Thai-Cambodian border are being assisted by the U.N. body, but
others could seek transfer to the U.N. refugee camp of Khao I Dang
and then apply for repatriation, refugee sources said.
   Large numbers of Cambodians fled violence, starvation and disease
as Vietnamese troops invaded their country in late 1978 and ousted
the brutal Khmer Rouge. Vast camps were set up along the frontier,
most of them controlled by various anti-Phnom Penh guerrilla groups,
including the Khmer Rouge.
   During a news conference last month, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen said his government would be willing to welcome all 250,000
refugees.
   Refugee officials generally believe most will not seek
repatriation because of the continued conflict in Cambodia.
   Only about 4,000 Laotian refugees in Thailand have returned home
under a similar U.N. refugee program that began in 1985.
   Last June, the U.N. refugee agency submitted the names of three
Cambodian refugees who wished to return to Phnom Penh authorities as
``test cases.'' The government has yet to respond to these
repatration requests.

   Carol Valenzuela, 20, disappeared in August 1974 from Vancouver.
Her remains were found near Yacolt in Clark County along with the
remains of a young woman in her late teens or early 20s whose
identity was never determined. Authorities are uncertain whether
Bundy is connected with the murders, and Keppel said Bundy denied he
was to blame.
   Authorities questioned Bundy in the death of Ann Marie Burr, an
8-year-old girl in Bundy's hometown of Tacoma, Wash., who
disappeared when Bundy was 14. Bundy denied killing the girl, Keppel
said.
   In May 1966, two 20-year-old airline flight attendants, Lonnie
Trumbell and Lisa Wick, were attacked and beaten in their Seattle
apartment. Ms. Trumbell died, while Ms. Wick suffered skull
fractures, but lived. Bundy lived nearby and worked at the
supermarket where the women shopped. Bundy also denied this attack,
Keppel said.
   Whitman County authorities say they also still consider Bundy a
suspect in the 1971 death of Joyce LaPage, 21, of Pasco, a student
at Washington State University in Pullman. Bundy denied he killed
her, but Keppel urged authorities to keep him on the suspect list.

<HEAD>At Least 11 Arrested In Northeast's Largest Poaching Sting</HEAD>

   Eleven people were arrested in a
poaching sting that uncovered the slaughter of more than 400 black
bears for their gall bladders, which are prized as aphrodisiacs in
the Far East.
   ``This is just the tip of this particular iceberg,'' said Walter
Bickford, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Fisheries,
Wildlife and Environmental Law Enforcement. ``We're aware of
numerous other operations like this in Massachusetts.''
   The arrests were made in raids that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Florida, wildlife
officials said.
   The raids were the culmination of a 2{-year investigation that
``tracked approximately $50,000 in transactions involving everything
from endangered species to black bear gall bladders.''
   ``This operation is the most extensive ever conducted in the
Northeast,'' said Alan McGroary, director of the Massachusetts
Division of Environmental Law Enforcement.
   Some of the dozens of pelts and gall bladders confiscated in the
raids were displayed at a news conference. Among the pelts were
those of a mountain lion and several bobcats.
   Also displayed were videotapes and photographs of 27 bear
carcasses piled in a meadow in the Catskills. Bickford said
investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in addition to
carcasses and skins.
   He said the number of black bears apparently slaughtered for
their gall bladders nearly equaled the black bear population in
Massachusetts. Most of the bears were taken in Maine, New Hampshire
and Canada, he said.
   The arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that were
said to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn, which hold the
same value in the Far East as the gall bladders.
   ``This is a primitive superstition,'' said Bickford. ``There is
no proof whatsoever'' that the bear organs or rhinoceros horns are
aphrodisiacs, he said.
   The superstition, however, has pushed the street value of dried,
powdered black bear gall bladders overseas above that of heroin or
cocaine in the United States, Bickford said. The powder can sell for
$540 an ounce or more.
   The investigation was led by two field officers from
Massachusetts and New York, who took part in what Bickford described
as strange rituals in their undercover work.
   One ritual involved christening new pickup trucks ``by building a
bed of dead deer carcasses. ... When you're dealing with a group
like this, you're talking about some bizarre behavior,'' he said.
   Three of the arrested people were from Massachusetts, three more
were from Connecticut, four from New Hampshire and one was arrested
in Florida. Wildlife officials said more arrests were expected.
   The arrested people jointly face more than 100 counts, ranging
from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without a license.
Penalties for each count range up to one year in prison and $1,000
in fines.
   The sale of black bear gall bladders is forbidden in most states,
although the bears may legally be hunted in many. In Massachusetts,
only the sale of the head, hide and hooves of deer is permitted
under certain conditions.
   McGroary said the investigation began when Massachusetts game
officials uncovered evidence that a Connecticut meat dealer had
illegally supplied venison to a western Massachusetts restaurant he
refused to identify.

<HEAD>Report: Indian Museum Site Favors Smithsonian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new plan has emerged after years of debate to
move the bulk of the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts
from New York City to Washington, D.C., a newspaper reported today.
   The Museum of the American Indian would relocate from its
Manhattan site to the Mall in Washington, The New York Times
reported. The Smithsonian Institution would build and operate that
museum, as well as a smaller Indian museum in New York.
   Although the collection is considered the finest of its kind, it
has been virtually invisible in its current location in upper
Manhattan, far from the usual tourist areas.
   The museum is only able to display about 1 percent of the
collection, and the rest is stored in a four-story warehouse in the
Bronx. There has been increasing concern that the collection could
be deteriorating.
   Various plans had been raised for several years to move the
collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of being moved
to Dallas. But New York City officials intervened, pointing out that
a trust established for the museum 73 years ago requires that it
remain in New York.
   Last April, Smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break
the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one
remaining at the old Manhattan site and another moving into the old
U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan.
   The newest plan would move a portion to the Custom House,
satisfying the terms of the trust and increasing the museum's
visibility in New York.
   Mary Ellen Burns, an assistant attorney general in New York City,
said the state had made a major concession in agreeing to give the
Smithsonian full title to the collection.
   The attorney general's office is charged with overseeing trusts.
   The Times said the state has insisted that the customs house be
used to display the collection in New York.
   Burns said the city and the Heye Foundation, which runs the
existing museum, agree with the general provisions of the new
proposal.
   The newspaper said approval of the new proposal hinges on
Congress, which must approve funds for a new museum.

<HEAD>Soviets, Feeding the City, Distribute Flour to Factory Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops, shouldering what one of
their generals has called Moscow's new task of feeding Kabul, today
distributed 275 tons of airlifted flour and heating fuel to more
than 5,000 workers at a state-owned factory.
   The distribution at a concrete block factory _ in the presence of
invited Western correspondents _ was noticeably orderly compared
with unruly scenes of Afghan soldiers beating back crowds from
Soviet armored personnel carriers during other emergency handouts in
the capital last week.
   The Afghan workers, most of whom maintained still want the Soviet
army out of the country, hauled away 150-pound sacks of flour that
soldiers unloaded from trucks.
   Soviet Col. Vadim Solovye, asked about reports the Soviets
suspect emergency supplies handed over to the Afghan regime wind up
with party officials, said merely: ``To do this through the Afghan
(administration) would take a long time.''
   Behind the Soviet-built factory near Kabul's airport, Ilyushin-76
transport planes were seen landing and taking off in what the
Soviets said was the fifth day of a week-long airlift of 400-500
tons daily from the Soviet cities of Tashkent and Fergana.
   Soviet officers said the airlifts will continue as needed when
the army completes the scheduled withdrawal of its troops by Feb. 15.
   It is unclear, however, whether Moscow will be able to continue
feeding this capital's 2.2 million people if Moslem insurgents _ who
are already causing severe disrupts for road convoys _ mount an
economic blockade aimed at strangling President Najib's regime after
his Soviet protectors withdraw.
   ``Anything can happen, but I think that (a blockade) will remain
really just a threat,'' Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, deputy head of the
Soviet military command in Afghanistan, told reporters.
   This week's emergency airlift followed acute shortages in the
city last week, with fights breaking out in long lines at bread
stores.
   Western diplomats say the state-owned silo that holds the
capital's flour supply is down to less than one day's supply. The
Soviets say the city needs 120 tons a day, but Afghan officials say
it needs 500 tons.
   ``It's good they're going, but don't worry, they'll continue to
help us,'' said a 16-year-old who identified himself as Humanani.
The youth came with his father to help carry away several sacks of
flour for their family of nine.
   Sayed Wazir, a wrinkled 55-year-old, complained: ``For two weeks
it's been very hard to get anything.''
   Asked what would happen when the Soviet troops go, he looked
bewildered. ``Perhaps the government will help us,'' he said.
   In another development, Western diplomatic sources said Afghan
military and state security police were making house-to-house
searches and hauling off young men for army conscription.
   Despite evidence of substantial troop movements north toward the
Soviet border and by air, Serebrov said Sunday that the final stage
of the Soviet withdrawal has not yet begun.
   He remained cautious today: ``Just say the withdrawal is
continuing.''
   Western diplomats, who believe the Soviets want to cover up he
withdrawal for security and diplomatic reasons, say the final stage
of the two-stage withdrawal started at the beginning of January.
   Under a U.N.-mandated agreement, 50,000 Soviet troops left
Afghanistan by last Aug. 15 and the rest _ another 50,000 _ are due
to be gone by Feb. 15.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in Dec. 1979 to prop up
the pro-Marxist government.

<HEAD>Settlers Raid Arab Village To Avenge Stoning Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Jewish settlers went on a rampage in a
West Bank village and smashed windows of Arab houses after their bus
was stoned and a passenger was struck in the eye by flying glass,
news reports said today.
   Residents of the village of Bidya said the settlers from Ariel,
18 miles north of Jerusalem, left behind handwritten leaflets in
Arabic calling on Palestinians to stop the violence ``before it's
too late.''
   ``We will not sit quietly while you commit terror acts against
us,'' the leaflet said. ``We are calling on you and stretching out
our hand for peace, for the sake of our children and yours.''
   Palestinians have routinely attacked Israeli civilian cars with
rocks and firebombs during their 13-month uprising. At least 368
Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed since the revolt
against Israeli occupation began on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Also today, a Jerusalem court convicted four Israeli journalists
of membership in the banned Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, headed by Palestinian radical Nayef Hawatmeh.
   Yakov and Ronnie Ben-Efrat, Asaf Adiv and Michal Shwartz of the
Marxist Derech Hanitzotz newspaper were sentenced to prison terms of
up to 30 months. Authorities closed the paper last year.
   The four struck a plea bargain, confessing to membership in the
Democratic Front in exchange for the court's dropping the more
serious charges of contacts with foreign agents.
   In other developments, the army said it demolished or sealed the
rooms of three suspected Palestinian activists from the Jabaliya
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The army demolished the room of Mohammed Khader, allegedly a
member of a ``popular committee'' responsible for organizing
anti-Israeli protests. Khader was suspected of attacking fellow
Arabs seen as cooperating with Israel.
   Two other rooms, belonging to suspects in firebomb attacks, were
sealed, military officials said. The measure is a frequent
punishment used by the army.
   The army also sentenced a 30-year-old reserve soldier to 18 days
in military jail for refusing to serve in the occupied lands.
   Sgt. Arnon Ronen was the 54th soldier sentenced to a jail term
for such refusal since the uprising began, although an estimated 500
troops have requested and received transfers out of the territories
without facing disciplinary action.
   Israel radio and the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper said about
100 settlers raided Bidya late Tuesday after a 16-year-old girl from
Ariel was hit in the eye by broken glass when a passenger bus was
stoned.
   Yediot said the settlers arrived in 50 cars, parked them on the
main village road leading to Bidya and jammed traffic, then marched
into the village carrying Israeli flags.
   Arab villagers hid inside their homes and the settlers smashed
windows of houses until soldiers came and stopped them, Yediot said.
A military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports.
   An Arab reporter who spoke to Bidya residents said the settlers
distributed a leaflet calling on villagers to stop the violence.
   ``We used to live together and we respected each other,'' the
leaflet said. ``We are sorry to say the relations fell apart in
recent months, when individuals on your side started stoning cars
and throwing firebombs at our women and children.''
   About 70,000 settlers, who live in the occupied lands amid 1.7
million Arabs, have frequently blamed the army for being too soft on
the Palestinians and not putting an end to the rebellion.

   Britain's sending of representatives to Emperor
Hirohito's funeral does not mean it has ``forgotten or forgiven''
the atrocities Japan committed during World War II, Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said.
   The decision to send Prince Philip and himself to the Feb. 24
funeral was made because Japan now is ``an important, democratic
member of the free world,'' Howe said.
   His comments were contained in a letter to Labor Party lawmaker
Jack Ashley that was released today. They are the government's most
detailed response yet to widespread public criticism over British
representation at the funeral of a man many veterans still consider
a war criminal.
   ``I am aware of the very strong feeling which has been expressed
and I can assure you that Britain's representation at the funeral
certainly does not mean that we have forgotten or forgiven the
atrocities committed during the Second World War,'' Howe wrote.
   ``Nothing can obliterate what happened then. Nor shall we ever
forget the great debt we owe to those who fought and died in the Far
East and the terrible sufferings of so many in Japanese prison
camps. The same is true of our Allies, many of whom are being
represented at the funeral by heads of state or government.''
   President Bush is among world leaders who plan to attend the
funeral.
   About 27,000 British prisoners of war died at the hands of the
Japanese during World War II, many of them in the forced
construction of the notorious Burma railway.
   A British war veterans' group said today it appreciated Howe's
remarks but still was dismayed that such a senior member of the
royal family was attending the funeral.
   Harold Payne, president of the Federation of Far Eastern
Prisoners of War Associations, said he feared that ``with all these
high dignitaries going, the Japanese will assume they are being
exonerated for all the dreadful things they did in the war.''
   Howe said the Allies decided at the end of the war in 1945 that
Hirohito should not be held responsible either for the war itself or
for atrocities committed during the war. They found no evidence
linking him personally with political decisions taken by the
Japanese empire during that time, he said.
   ``Indeed, the one decision that the emperor clearly had taken
himself was in August 1945, when the war cabinet was split on
whether to continue the war,'' Howe said.
   ``The government then, for the first time, turned to the emperor,
who decided that Japan should surrender and that he should
personally broadcast the news to the nation.''
   Howe said the queen decided her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh,
should represent her at the funeral after receiving advice from the
government.
   ``It (her decision) was taken in light of the fact that Japan
today is an important, democratic member of the free world and an
important partner of the United Kingdom,'' said Howe, who will
represent Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Ashley said today that ``misguided ministerial advice to the duke
will insult many ex-servicemen precisely because they cannot forgive
or forget.''

<TEXT>
   Serial killer Ted Bundy exchanged several
letters with a religious broadcaster and anti-pornography crusader
before they met for a videotaped interview hours before Bundy's
execution, an associate said.
   James C. Dobson, whose half-hour ``Focus on the Family'' program
is heard daily on 1,200 radio stations, was the only member of the
news media to interview Bundy in the days leading up to the Tuesday
morning execution. Bundy canceled a press conference with 30
journalists on Monday.
   During the interview, Bundy coolly traced his origins as a serial
killer, describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornography
became ``an addiction'' that grew until his ``destructive energy''
exploded from fantasy into reality.
   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people like
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,
by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' Bundy
said.
   Dobson was an outspoken member of former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's federal Commission on Pornography and was a leader of
the nationwide protest last summer against Universal Pictures' ``The
Last Temptation of Christ.''
   Dobson first received a letter from Bundy in 1987, said Paul
Hetrick, a vice president of the California-based Focus on the
Family ministry. The broadcaster then answered three or four more
letters from Bundy, said Hetrick.
   Bundy requested the interview with Dobson through John Tanner, a
newly elected state prosecutor in Daytona Beach who previously
counseled Bundy through a religious ministry at the Florida State
Prison near Starke.
   Hetrick would not reveal the content of the letters exchanged
between Bundy and Dobson, who met for a two-hour private interview
Sunday. Dobson is scheduled to address the National Religious
Broadcasters annual convention in Washington on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Hustler magazine's sexually explicit
caricatures lampooning an anti-pornography activist are protected by
the Constitution and cannot be considered libelous, federal appeals
court ruled.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday unanimously
rejected a libel suit filed against the magazine by the activist,
Andrea Dworkin.
   The court said Hustler was merely expressing an opinion.
   Dworkin, a feminist writer, was the author of an Indianapolis
ordinance, which since has been declared unconstitutional, that
defined pornography as a violation of women's civil rights and
allowed women to bring civil lawsuits.
   Like other critics of pornography, she was lampooned in Hustler.
   A March 1984 issue included photographs of women engaged in
lesbian sex, or masturbation, and included scenes of violence and
fake blood; a caption on one picture referred to the ``Andrea
Dworkin Fan Club.'' A December 1984 cartoon showed a fat woman
having oral sex and identified the woman as Dworkin's mother.
   ``Dworkin errs by limiting `opinion' to high-minded discourse,''
the court said, adding that ``outrageous and outlandish statements
are sometimes protected.''
   ``Ludicrous statements are much less insidious and debilitating
than falsities that bear the ring of truth,'' the court said.
``Speech may not be suppressed simply because it is offensive.''
   Dworkin's $150 million lawsuit was transferred from Wyoming to
Los Angeles at the magazine's request and dismissed by U.S. District
Judge A. Wallace Tashima. It was that ruling the appeals court
upheld.

   A teen-ager who police said poured

sentenced to 18 months in prison.
   Charles E. Hill Jr., 17, and the friend fatally burned the
Doberman pinscher April 22 in a dispute over a bicycle with the son
of the dog's owner, police said.
   ``It made me sick,'' said Judge Leroy H. Moe, who sentenced Hill
to a year in jail on a misdemeanor animal-cruelty charge and 18
months in prison for burglary of the dog owner's residence and
possession of cocaine.
   The sentences will run concurrently.
   The judge on Tuesday also ordered Hill to undergo a psychiatric
evaluation and perform 100 hours of community service.
   After imposing the maximum jail term for the animal-cruelty
charge, Moe urged the Legislature to upgrade the crime to a felony
punishable by up to five years in prison.
   Hill had pleaded guilty. The co-defendant, Odis Knowles, 17, is
scheduled to stand trial on Thursday.

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The alleged leader of an all-white
African National Congress guerrilla cell gave a clenched-fist salute
today as he and two colleagues made their first court appearance.
   The three, charged with terrorism, attempted murder and other
offenses, were arrested May 8, 1988 at a farmhouse near Johannesburg
where, according to police, they had amassed the largest guerrilla
arms cache ever found in South Africa.
   The alleged leader of the group is Damian de Lange, 31, a former
newspaper reporter for the now-defunct Rand Daily Mail.
   He raised his fist and shouted ``Amandla'' _ the Zulu word for
power _ as he entered Pretoria Magistrate's Court.
   Appearing with him were Ian Robertson, 37, a South African who
allegedly received guerrilla training in the Soviet Union, and Susan
Donelly, 24, a British subject who allegedly was the unit's
communications specialist.
   The three were not asked to plead during the five-minute hearing,
and a request for bail was denied pending another court appearance
Feb. 7.
   A fourth person arrested at the farmhouse in Broederstroom, Hugh
Lugg, did not appear in court Wednesday. Defense attorneys said they
expected Lugg would appear as a state witness during the trial.
   The courthouse was heavily guarded, inside and outside, by police
armed with shotguns. Supporters and relatives of the suspects,
including Ms. Donelly's parents, filled the gallery, and the
British, U.S. and West German embassies sent observers.
   A SAM-7 surface-to-air missile was among the weapons found at the
farmhouse, according to police officials who said it was to be used
in an attack on a police helicopter. The suspects also have been
linked by police to a bomb blast in March 1988 which injured
soldiers on a military bus.
   Police headquarters said a bomb exploded today at an electrical
sub-station in Durban, causing minor damage and no injuries. The
type of explosive device was not identified immediately, but police
said a mini-limpet mine _ commonly used by ANC guerrillas _ was
found in a manhole near the blast site.
   The ANC has conducted a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961
aimed at pressuring the government into ending white-minority
domination in South Africa. The organization is predominantly black,
but several whites have been convicted over the years for
participating in its guerrilla campaign.

   The dean of South Africa's
largest medical school said today that two whites-only hospitals
should be opened to black patients to ease overcrowding in Soweto.
   Professor Clive Rosendorf, dean of the faculty of medicine at the
University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said the occupancy
rate at Soweto's Baragwanath Hospital has been 155 percent, with
many patients sleeping on the floor.
   Baragwanath is the only full-service hospital in the black
township of 2.5 million people.
   Rosendorf said more beds should be provided at Baragwanath, but
he also recommended that black patients be admitted to two major
white hospitals in the region _ Johannesburg Hospital and South Rand
Hospital.
   All public hospitals in South Africa are racially segregated, as
are residential areas and government-run schools.

<TEXT>
   A parolee convicted of killing a police
officer and mutilating a college student was moved from his home for
fear a list of his crimes sent anonymously to neighbors might spark
violence, officials said.
   Raymond Louis George, 36, was moved from his North Hollywood
apartment on Tuesday. He had lived there less than a week.
   George was paroled Jan. 18 after nearly three years in prison for
carrying a knife. He previously served nine years for killing a
police officer, assaulting two others and attacking a 19-year-old
student with a machete in 1974.
   This week, copies of a Police Department internal memo listing
George's crimes were mailed anonymously to neighbors.
   ``We moved him because ... I was afraid there might be some sort
of demonstration,'' said Jerry DiMaggio, regional administrator of
the Parole Division of the California Department of Corrections.
``George is a dangerous person, and we didn't want him to `go off'
if a confrontation occurred.''
   The location of his new home was not disclosed.
   The memo detailed George's criminal history, calling him a
mentally ill man who ``believes his mission in life is to kill
police officers and women.'' An anonymous note accompanying the memo
said he is ``a time bomb waiting to go off.''
   George takes medication for a psychiatric condition.
   ``Somehow the memo got passed around the community, and it
snowballed from there,'' DiMaggio said.
   Capt. Daniel B. Watson, who wrote the memo, said he has begun an
investigation to determine who was responsible for its unauthorized
release.
   Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a girl and hacking off
her arms, was paroled from a California prison in 1986. Officials
had to move him repeatedly because no community would accept him.

<HEAD>Marcos Apparently Seeking Plea-Bargaining With U.S. Authorities</HEAD>

   Ailing Ferdinand Marcos wants to open
talks with U.S. and Filipino authorities on racketeering charges,
which may be a first step toward a plea-bargain to allow him to
return home, officials said.
   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez told reporters Tuesday that he
received a telephone call from U.S. Assistant Attorney Charles
LaBella, who has been gathering evidence against the deposed
president.
   Ordonez said LaBella told him that Marcos wanted to open talks on
the October racketeering indictment, in which he and his wife Imelda
are accused of embezzling more than $100 million during his 20-year
rule.
   Ordonez refused to spell out details of what Marcos wanted to
discuss other than to say it was limited to the U.S. federal
racketeering charge.
   ``All that was impressed upon me was that Marcos ... is
determined to discuss with the American authorities and the
Philippine government,'' Ordonez said. Marcos and his wife have
lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in the 1986 military-civilian
revolt that propelled Corazon Aquino to power.
   Ordonez said the government wanted to make sure that any
intermediaries were authorized to speak for Marcos and his family.
   ``My reply is we must first be sure that these persons are duly
authorized to speak,'' he said. ``Their plan is to have a spokesman
for Marcos, spokesman for Imelda and spokesman for the children,''
he added.
   In New York, LaBella said Marcos' lawyers contacted him to relay
an undisclosed message to the Philippine government. LaBella refused
to disclose the contents and refused to describe the message as
plea-bargaining.
   The Philippine consul-general in Honolulu, Tomas Gomez, said he
was unaware of the messages from LaBella, but Gomez added: ``If
they're really going through Charles LaBella, it sounds more like a
plea-bargain with the U.S. government, and if that's the case, it's
a very delayed response.''
   Presidential Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig recently said
the Philippine government can no longer decide whether Marcos can
return home because Marcos is under criminal indictment in the
United States.
   The Philippine government claims Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion before his ouster. Mrs. Aquino has
repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii,
citing national security.
   She has also said Marcos must return all the money he allegedly
stole before there could any discussions on conditions for his
return.
   Marcos was hospitalized Jan. 15 in Hawaii suffering from
pneumonia and bronchial asthma. He was hospitalized twice last month
for treatment of congestive heart failure.
   In Honolulu, a hospital spokeswoman said Marcos' condition was
upgraded to satisfactory and he was removed from a respirator.

<DATELINE>SHARORA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said today the death toll from
an earthquake and mudslide in Soviet Central Asia was only about a
quarter of the 1,000 originally estimated, and they called off
efforts to find more survivors.
   ``We will transform the settlement of Sharora into a common grave
with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe,''
said Khusain Kasymov, Communist Party chief in the Tadzhikistan
republic's stricken Gissar region.
   He said there was no hope of finding more survivors in Sharora,
where 52 homes were buried and 100 bodies were hauled from the mud
and debris.
   The republic's prime minister, Izzatullo Khayoyev, said 274
people were known to have died in Monday's pre-dawn quake, which
toppled all 88 mud-brick dwellings in Okuli-Bolo and sent mudslides
as high as 50 feet onto the villages of Sharora and Okuli-Poyen.
   ``There may be a difference of five or seven people in the
casualties, but no more,'' Khayoyev said in an interview on a grassy
hill overlooking Okuli-Bolo, 20 miles southwest of the capital,
Dushanbe.
   The official Tass news agency earlier made a preliminary estimate
that up to 1,000 people died in the quake and mudslide. Officials on
the scene did not explain the discrepancy in figures.
   A day of mourning was declared in Tadzhikistan, which borders
China and Afghanistan. All flags were at half-staff, plays and
concerts were canceled and restaurants were closed.
   ``The bitter truth is that nobody can be rescued from under a
landslide provoked by the earthquake,'' Tass said.
   But there were stories of miraculous survival.
   Kholmurod Barotov, 17, of Sharora said his 6-day-old cousin
survived the quake held above the torrent of mud by her father, who
perished.
   One man, 27-year-old Sergei Muratov, was found alive buried in
the mud, the prime minister said. Tass said Muratov was in grave
condition at a Dushanbe hospital.
   The agency said Sharora, the largest of the stricken villages,
would be rebuilt near its former site and that construction would
begin in several days.
   The 40-second tremor, which measured 5.4 on the Richter scale,
hit before dawn Monday, loosening layers of mud that cascaded onto
the rural villages.
   Last month, a quake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale killed
about 25,000 people in Soviet Armenia.
   Workers using shovels and bulldozers dug for survivors Tuesday,
but local officials said today the efforts were in vain.
   Vitaly Zhukov, who works at the republic's official news agency
and is chief of a press information center set up in the wake of the
tragedy, said no survivors were found Tuesday.
   Tadzhikistan officials said there would be no attempt to dig out
the bodies of victims, unlike the efforts that lasted for weeks
after the Armenian quake.
   ``Moslem law, the Shariah, says that people buried alive must be
left there,'' Khayoyev said. Most of Tadzhikistan's 4.8 million
people are Moslem.
   He said relatives of those killed in Sharora voted Tuesday to
fence off the settlement and transform it into a common graveyard.
   But other officials said two families had objected, and when
foreign journalists visited the site today, residents and police
were digging with shovels in at least two places.
   Zhukov said the republic would need about 400 prefabricated
houses for survivors in the stricken villages.
   Tass said the Soviet Red Cross sent a planeload of relief
supplies to the region and that the Armenian Red Cross announced it
would send a rescue team to Tadzhikistan.
   A special bank account was set up in Moscow to accept
contributions to aid victims.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda on Tuesday said much
of the mud was carried to the villages by an earthen canal saturated
by melting snow in the Babatag hills overlooking the buried towns.
   When the quake hit, it ``moved in a huge mass onto the
villages,'' Pravda said. ``There is a danger of new mudslides in
similar places in the event of a new natural blow.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian's administration
is postponing until the mid-1990s the sale of more than $4 billion
in bonds because the state can't afford the principal and interest,
an aide says.
   The bonds would have provided financing for school construction,
earthquake safety, the homeless, safe drinking water and juvenile
halls.
   The decision to delay the bond sales helped Deukmejian balance
his $47.8 billion 1989-90 budget proposal while rebuilding the
emergency reserve to $1.1 billion, said Stan Stancell, his assistant
finance director.
   The postponement permits a delay in budgeting tens of millions of
dollars for repayment, which must begin almost as soon as bonds are
sold.
   Failure to budget repayment could raise ``big questions'' on Wall
Street that could weaken the state's credit rating, Stancell said.
   ``I don't think it would be prudent (to sell bonds) without
showing how we are going to pay for them,'' he said.
   Stancell said the administration could change its decision if
revenues improve enough.

   Two Shiite Moslem militias battled with
mortars and machine guns in south Lebanon today several hours after
negotiators for both sides reached a cease-fire accord in Syria.
   Police said at least five fighters were injured in the one-hour
battle between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the pro-Syrian Amal militia in south Lebanon's Apple province.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
fighting broke out between Hezbollah positions in the villages of
Jbaa and Ein Bouswar and Amal fighters in the hamlets of Kfar Filla
and Jarjou.
   Jbaa is the key to a triangular-shaped enclave controlled by
about 500 Hezbollah fighters on the western edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Earlier in the day, the Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a
statement in Damascus saying the Shiite factions had agreed to an
immediate cease-fire following three days of mediation by Syria and
Iran.
   It said the militias would continue negotiations aimed at
reaching a ``comprehensive reconciliation agreement to regulate the
relationship between Amal and Hezbollah and deal with the reasons
for tension for the sake of Lebanon's unity and its liberation from
Israeli occupation.''
   The factions have been fighting on and off for nine months in a
struggle for control of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's
largest sect.
   More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded in a
series of battles that began in April. Several earlier cease-fires
collapsed under the deep-rooted hostility between the rival militias.
   The Israelis and their militia allies control a ``security zone''
Israel maintains north of its border with Lebanon. The zone was
created in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
   The Shiite battles have strained the strategic alliance between
Iran and Syria, Tehran's main Arab ally during its eight-year war
with Iraq, and both sides have sought to quell the fighting.
   Hezbollah seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon. The more secular and nationalist Amal seeks a multisect
government in which Moslems would share power equally with the once
dominant Christians.
   Hezbollah advocates guerrilla attacks on Israel in a Moslem
campaign to liberate Jerusalem. Amal seeks only to drive the
Israelis out of the border strip and wants to curb Hezbollah's raids
because they provoke Israeli retaliation.

   Leftist guerrillas are likely to
be politically strengthened by their startling offer to take part in
elections, whether the proposal prospers or dies on the vine.
   Even government officials grudgingly admit the insurgents will
probably be bolstered by the surprise proposal made Tuesday.
   One high-ranking Cabinet official likened the guerrillas' offer
to a bomb and complimented the rebels on devising such a powerful
weapon.
   ``It is very ably constructed. You have to take it apart very
carefully and examine all the component parts in trying to
deactivate it,'' he said of the rebels' radical policy shift.
   The Cabinet official spoke on condition of anonymity because the
government has not formally responded to the rebel proposal. The
United States also has not responded.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, the incumbent Christian Democrats'
presidential candidate in this year's election, said Tuesday that
the rebels' main condition for participating in the vote could not
be met.
   The guerrillas said elections set for March 19 should be
postponed until September, but the Constitution prohibits such a
postponement.
   The proposal from the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
can be taken at face value _ or it can be examined for possible
ulterior motives.
   A nine-year-old civil war has devastated this Massachusetts-sized
nation, killing 65,000 of its people, making refugees of a million
and ruining the economy.
   The guerrillas, who have called previous elections this decade
``farce'' and part of a counterinsurgency plan, may simply want to
end the war.
   ``The country is headed for a social explosion. We feel a
responsbility to explore possible alternatives. We are being
responsible and flexible,'' Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the
guerrilla General Command, told a news conference Tuesday in Mexico
City.
   ``Flexibility is a sign of strength,'' said Salvador Samayoa, a
member of the guerrillas' political-diplomatic committee.
   The rebel document's authors said their offer was partially
motivated by ``an international situation in which the majority of
wars are being resolved by means of negotiation.''
   Negotiations have recently produced agreements to seek an end
conflicts in Afghanistan and Angola, among other countries. The
Contra insurgency in Nicaragua has also been quieted by a
preliminary cease-fire agreement.
   A rebel source in Mexico said: ``There is a wave of negotiations
in the world. We want to look for a solution that is not so drastic
(as war) so the country's fall won't be so drastic.''
   The guerrillas don't just want to end the war _ they presumably
want to win it. Their proposal, especially if rejected, could
improve their standing.
   Reporters who recently spent time with guerrillas in the hills of
Chalatenango and Morazan provinces, both rebel strongholds, heard
leaders talk of preparations for a big push in coming weeks.
   The insurgents launched two nationwide offensives late last year.
During the past three months they have hit four major military
installations in the capital, bringing a predominantly rural war to
the city.
   The guerrillas appear heady, and sources close to them confirmed
that attacks will increase if the proposal gets nowhere.
   If the rebels do step up their attacks, they likely will point to
rejection of their election overture as a spurning that left them no
alternative but to escalate warfare against an intransigent regime.
   Most military observers say the 7,000 rebels have little chance
of defeating the 56,000-man army. The rebels say they are organizing
rural and urban sympathizers and that the moment for mass
insurrection is not far off.
   The rebel proposal appeared to have been directed as much at U.S.
politicians as the guerrillas' countrymen.
   Copies of the proposal were circulating in Washington on Sunday,
24 hours before being leaked to the press in San Salvador.
   The two administrations of Ronald Reagan gave more than $3
billion in aid to El Salvador with the stated object of fostering
democracy. The country has had a civilian president, Jose Napoleon
Duarte, since 1984, but leftists claim his administration is a
facade for continued military power.
   ``We hear they (in the Bush administration) are more practical
and less ideological,'' Samayoa told the Mexico news conference.
``We hope for a departure from the policy of the administration of
Ronald Reagan, which blocked peace efforts in Central America.''
   The rebels enjoy significant support from so-called
``solidarity'' groups in the United States that have proven
effective lobbyists in the past.
   However their proposal is received, the rebels will not lose
their current supporters. If it is rejected, they could use alleged
government inflexibility as a recruitment tool. If it is accepted
with modifications, they and their political allies could increase
their base through campaigning.
   ``The document was drafted with great skill,'' said the
government official. ``If they shot as well as they write, they
would have routed us by now.''

   President Bush will travel to Canada to meet
with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Feb. 10, and two weeks later
will fly to Tokyo to attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, responding to a report
today saying that the president would also visit China while in the
Far East, said ``there are no plans at this time'' for such a trip.
   There has been widespread speculation that Bush would use the
occasion of the Japanese trip to visit both China and South Korea
before returning to Washington from the trip to the Orient, which
begins about two weeks after the visit to Ottawa.
   The Canada trip will be the first outside the United States for
the new president. The White House press office said Tuesday that
Bush and Mulroney ``will discuss bilateral and international issues
of common concern'' during the one-day Ottawa visit.

   A man whose girlfriend had broken up
with him fatally shot one of her friends at the mushroom farm where
he worked, then killed himself outside a school as police closed in,
authorities said.
   The gunman, Ignacio Vasquez Segura, 25, of Watsonville, also
seriously wounded two co-workers Tuesday at the farm 80 miles south
of San Francisco.
   His former girlfriend, Francisca Partido, was not at work when
Segura, wearing sunglasses and carrying a semiautomatic rifle,
walked into a packing shed.
   The 50 workers inside scattered when Segura asked for one woman
by name, shot her, then sprayed the inside of the building with
gunfire, said Francisca Gabriella Geisler, a lab technician who was
working in the shed.
   ``Everybody was going crazy. I saw them screaming and trying to
hide,'' she said.
   A 26-year-old woman was killed in the first burst of gunfire,
said sheriff's investigator Bob Reneau. Her identity was not
immediately released.
   Geisler said the woman had tried to help Segura's former
girlfriend since the couple split up three months ago.
   The wounded workers were listed in stable condition today at
Watsonville Community Hospital.
   Segura, who was carrying three clips of ammunition, fired about
12 shots, then fled in a sports car and stopped several miles away
near North Monterey County High School, with a California Highway
Patrol vehicle behind him, authorities said.
   He shot himself in the head before backup officers arrived
moments later, authorities said. Reneau said Segura revved his
engine to full acceleration, muffling the shot.
   The school had been alerted to the shootings and chase, and
Principal Dennis Carocci ordered students to remain in their
classrooms. He said he closed the gate to the school as Segura drove
up.
   Segura's arrival at the school prompted fear of an incident
similar to the slayings last week of five youngsters in a Stockton
schoolyard.
   The high school received about 60 calls immediately after the
incident from concerned parents, Carocci said.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of a liberal
Afrikaans-language newspaper pleaded innocent today to a charge of
violating security laws by quoting a banned leader of the African
National Congress.
   Max du Preez, editor of Free Weekly, said the article in question
did not directly quote Joe Slovo, leader of the South African
Communist Party and the only white member of the ANC's national
executive committee.
   Instead, du Preez said, the Nov. 11 article conveyed the views of
the writer, Mark Swilling, a political scientist who joined other
South Africans at a conference in October in West Germany attended
by Soviet officials and ANC leaders, including Slovo.
   Slovo and virtually all other ANC leaders cannot be quoted
legally in South Africa. The organization, which operates from
offices abroad, has conducted a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed
at undermining white-minority rule.
   Free Weekly, established last year, is the only anti-apartheid
newspaper aimed specifically as Afrikaners, the mainly
Dutch-descended whites who control the government.
   At the hearing today in Johannesburg Magistrates Court, du Preez
pleaded guilty to charges that four issues of Free Weekly were
published before it was registered with Department of Home Affairs.
   The hearing will resume Feb. 13.
   In Johannesburg and Cape Town, journalists and political
activists held meetings to protest the government's continuing
crackdown on opposition newspapers and magazines.
   Four anti-apartheid publications, all with circulations of less
than 20,000, have been warned by Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha
that they face temporary closure for allegedly publishing subversive
material.
   The editor of one of the threatened publications, Glenn Moss of
Work in Progress, said the government ensured that its propaganda
was publicized but prevented its opponents from speaking out.
   Another of the threatened publications is Al-Qalam, a monthly
newspaper produced by the Muslim Youth League.
   Its staff issued a statement saying in part: ``The limits to what
we publish will be determined not by the apartheid state, but by our
divinely guided principles of truth and justice.''

<HEAD>House Leaders Say Pressure to Get a Budget Agreement Very Strong</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 11 grafs new with Foley, Michel quotes; picks up 4th graf

   Pressure to get an agreement on a federal
budget is very strong, the House Democratic leader said today,
because nobody wants to see an across-the-board cut in federal
programs.
   ``We have a target pretty much of a budget resolution by about
the 15th of April,'' Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., House majority leader,
said on the ``CBS This Morning'' television program.
   ``Nine months from now we run into the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
(deficit-reduction) deadlines. That means you're going to have an
across-the-board cut in both defense and domestic accounts, unless
they're exempt accounts, which will take care of the budget deficit
targets if we don't have a budget plan that's agreed on between the
House and the Senate and the administration,'' he said.
   ``That sort of pressure to get an agreement is very strong,
because no one wants to see ... an across-the-board cut,'' Foley
said.
   President Bush met Tuesday with Foley and other congressional
leaders to set the stage for this year's budget work. He plans to
speak about his administration's priorities in an address to
Congress on Feb. 9 and then detail his budget proposals soon
thereafter.
   Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill, the House minority leader, said he
hoped the time frame would be telescoped to considerably less than
nine months.
   ``We'd like to do as we did last year, get our appropriations
bills out on time. That means that the budget resolution and its
allocations ought to be done just as quickly and speedily as
possible,'' he said.
   Foley said he wants to see the specifics of Bush's budget before
making any decision on a budget summit.
   ``We haven't decided on a precise formula or process yet but we
are listening to the president's suggestions and we are promising to
get back to him after we hear the specifics of his budget,'' he said.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, made a point Tuesday of
emphasizing there would be consultations, not negotiations.
   ``We'd like to wait and until we see a budget, until we see where
the areas of agreement and disagreement would be, before we
consult,'' Wright said.
   Wright presented Bush a jar of pork rinds and some hot pepper
sauce, one of the president's favorite snacks.
   ``There is (a) good atmosphere,'' said George Mitchell, D-Maine,
the Senate Majority Leader.
   The president's choice for budget director, Richard Darman,
suggested weekly meetings between the White House and selected
leaders from Congress in order to expedite the budget process.
   But while lawmakers said they'd be glad to meet, and would work
to keep the process running on time, none was ready to put a new
team of negotiators above the committees already charged with
working out spending plans.
   ``The president's team will be welcomed, as soon as they want to
come, by our budget committees,'' Wright said.
   ``It would be to our advantage to have the leadership meet in an
informal sort of way from time to time, moving the process along,''
said Michel. He did not support bypassing the current process, he
said.
   Although there is precedent for a budget ``summit'' _ one
occurred in late 1987 after the stock market crisis _ it is
unpopular on Capitol Hill because it cuts most lawmakers out of the
process. In addition, cautious congressional leaders do not want to
be wedded in any way to the Bush budget proposals until they are
made public.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the president needed first to send up his budget and
then begin discussions without setting up a new framework.
   While a ``summit'' can serve a function, it also carries the risk
of leaving the rest of Congress behind _ and alienating the votes
needed to enact the results, he said.
   ``You could cut a deal at a high level only to find out that
members aren't going to be with you when it comes to a vote,'' he
said. ``A worse thing than failing to get an agreement is getting an
agreement that fails.''

   A man who kidnapped a warehouse director
snatched a $25,000 ransom and eluded FBI agents and police staking
out the drop-off site, authorities said. The victim was found shot
to death the next morning.
   The surveillance team had lost track of the car the kidnapper
used to pick up the ransom Monday night, Bergen County Prosecutor
John Holl said Tuesday.
   ``It was dark,'' Holl said, adding that officials had been unable
to see clearly enough to give a description of the kidnapper.
   Irving Flax, 58, was abducted Monday on his way to work at the
LDF Trucking Warehouse in Secaucus. He later called to say he
wouldn't be coming in.
   Flax's wife, Marilyn Flax, received two calls from a man
informing her that her husband had been abducted and demanding that
she deliver $25,000 in a plain brown paper bag to the parking area
of a restaurant in Paramus, Holl said.
   Officials from the FBI, the prosecutor's office and police
watched as a man signaled to Mrs. Flax to drop the bag, Holl said.
The man then drove away in a car belonging to the victim.
   Flax was found shot to death in his car Tuesday morning in a
parking lot in Paramus.
   Holl said it was not known whether Flax knew his kidnapper.

   Two howitzer shells today hit the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon but did
not explode, U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said.
   He told reporters the 155mm shells were fired from around
Marjayoun, headquarters of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, in
Israel's self-designated security zone. SLA militiamen patrol the
buffer zone with Israeli forces.
   The nine-nation U.N. force, deployed in south Lebanon since 1978,
has frequently been caught in cross fire between rival forces in the
region.
   One shell hit the garden of Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, Swedish
commander of the 5,800-man U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, in the
compound in the southern border town of Naqoura, Goksel said.
   The other fell between the camps of the Italian and French
contingents inside the beachside headquarters compound, he said. No
casualties were reported.
   A security source in south Lebanon, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the shells were fired during what ``appeared to be a
major operation'' by the Israelis inside the security zone.
   He said he had no details of the reported operation but noted the
Israelis fired about 500 flares that illuminated the security zone
during the night. Several artillery and mortar rounds were fired in
the region, which overlaps the U.N. force's operations zone, the
source reported.
   Israel set up the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its army from south Lebanon in 1985.The border
strip is designed to curb guerrilla raids into northern Israel.
   Also today, Israeli troops and SLA militiamen expelled 40
Lebanese from the Sunni Moslem village of Shibaa inside the security
zone for refusing to cooperate with an Israeli-sponsored local
administration, police reported.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said they were rounded up during the night and included 25 children
between the ages of one and 12.
   They were driven in SLA trucks to a crossing on the northern edge
of the security zone, where they walked into the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa Valley, the spokesman said.
   On Jan. 5, 30 Lebanese were deported from the zone after being
charged with ``disrupting security'' there.
   Wahlgren visited Shibaa following today's expulsion and said, ``I
express my deep concern over the incident. I've sent a cable this
morning to the secretary-general of the United Nations in New York
explaining the situation.'' ``There is nothing to justify this
action. It is against international law,'' the UNIFIL commander
added in a statement.
   The statement said those expelled included ``a man of 81 and a
woman of 80 and nine children from the same family, the youngest
nine months old.''

   A former professional basketball player
has been convicted in the shotgun slaying of his wife and could face
the death penalty.
   Michael Donnell Niles, 33, of Corona, a forward for the Phoenix
Suns of the National Basketball Association in 1980 and 1981, was
found guilty Tuesday of conspiring with Noel Jackson to murder Sonja
Rose Niles in 1984.
   A jury on Monday convicted Jackson of the crime.
   Prosecutors said Niles hired Jackson to kill Mrs. Niles for a
$5,000 cut of a $100,000 life insurance policy. The two men accused
each other of the murder.
   A witness testified that Niles said he wanted his wife killed
because she ``messed me out'' of money from basketball.
   Because the jury determined it was a murder for financial gain,
Niles could face the death penalty at sentencing next week.
   Niles, who had played for California State University, Fullerton,
was a third-string forward for the Suns. He averaged 2.6 points in
46 games.

   A Thai Airways International jetliner
aborted a takeoff today from Bangkok airport, and 16 people were
injured during the emergency evacuation, officials said.
   The Airbus 300-600 with 252 people aboard was taking off for
Tokyo when the pilot noticed a fire warning indicator and aborted
the flight, said airline Vice President Chusak Baachaiyud.
   As the aircraft stopped, a smoke warning indicator came on and
the pilot ordered an emergency evacuation, Chusak said at a news
conference.
   He said passengers were injured as they left the aircraft on
eight slides from emergency exits.
   Except for one Thai national, all passengers aboard Flight 640
were Japanese, an airline spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The injured, all Japanese, were released from a local hospital
after treatment and were to fly back to Japan late today, Chusak
said.
   He said an investigation showed that a rupture in a high pressure
pneumatic duct caused the aircraft's left engine to overheat. The
smoke warning followed because the sudden and rapid stop generated
excessive heat in the braking system, Chusak said.
   Thai Airways International is the country's flag carrier and
flies to destinations in Asia, Europe and the United States.

   Government leaders today advised
President Roh Tae-woo to accept opposition demands for a referendum
on whether voters support him, officials said.
   At a meeting, leaders of the governing Democratic Justice Party
told Roh voters should have the chance to assess his performance,
said party officials.
   They said Roh called the meeting to deal with opposition
allegations he was trying to avoid the referendum.
   On Tuesday, Kim Dae-jung and other opposition party leaders
agreed to push for the referendum. Before he was elected in December
1987, Roh promised he would hold such a referendum after taking
office, but he set no date.
   Government party leaders lack broad public support but have said
Roh is confident of victory.
   Some opposition leaders contend Roh would have to resign if he
lost a referendum. Roh has only said he would ``accept
responsibility'' if defeated.
   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office in
February. But the opposition accuses him of being reluctant to take
firm action to deal with past government abuses.
   Opposition leaders have demanded the government punish officials
involved in corruption and other abuses under the authoritarian
government of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chun went into rural exile in November after making a public
apology for misdeeds under his administration, and Roh has asked the
nation to pardon him.
   In a related development today, prosecutors questioned three Chun
loyalists, including the former government security head, Chang
Se-dong, on charges of abusing power under the old government.
   Chang played a key role in helping Chun seize power in a coup in
1980.

   Joel Steinberg was optimistic when jurors asked
for clarification of murder laws, indicating they might be torn over
his guilt or innocence in the death of his illegally adopted
daughter, an attorney said.
   ``For the first time during deliberations, he is feeling more
optimistic,'' defense attorney Ira London said Tuesday.
   The jury returned today for a third day of deliberations.
   Jurors on Tuesday asked state Supreme Court Justice Harold
Rothwax if they could infer that Steinberg fatally beat 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg based on testimony that he beat his former live-in
companion, Hedda Nussbaum.
   Rothwax told jurors they could not, repeating what he told them
during his instructions. London then moved for a mistrial, which was
denied.
   Steinberg, a disbarred attorney, is charged with murdering Lisa,
whom he obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager but never legally
adopted.
   The child was removed comatose from Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment in 1987 and died at a hospital three days later of a brain
injury.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated househould attracted
wide attention and raised questions about the duty and ability of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, testified as
the prosecution's star witness that Steinberg told her in bed, after
they used cocaine and while Lisa lay comatose on their bathroom
floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get
up.''
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Nussbaum, whose murder charges
were dropped in return for her testimony, was too physically and
emotionally disabled by 12 years of living with Steinberg to have
harmed Lisa.
   Steinberg's lawyers charge that Ms. Nussbaum fatally beat the
child in a jealous rage.
   Later Tuesday, the jury asked Rothwax if it could move on to the
lesser homicide counts against Steinberg if it was not unanimous on
the murder charge.
   Rothwax reiterated that jurors could consider manslaughter only
if they were unanimous in acquitting him of murder.
   The jury received the case Monday after 12 weeks of trial and 52
witnesses.

<HEAD>Meat Group Opposes Overhaul of Inspection System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national meat trade association is urging the
Agriculture Department to withdraw a proposal for overhauling
federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants.
   USDA made the proposal last November to carry out a 1986 law that
would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome processing
plants but ease up on those with good records.
   Over time, officials estimated the USDA inspection force at the
affected plants would be reduced by half by retirements and
resignations. The program would rely increasingly on ``good'' plants
policing themselves.
   Department officials said the proposed rule changes would
strengthen inspection in the 6,300 plants that process meat and
poultry by focusing on those that need it most.
   But the American Meat Institute, in comments filed with USDA last
week, said the plan has serious problems and should be withdrawn and
then developed more carefully.
   The group said the proposal is ``overly complex, cumbersome and
burdensome to the regulated industry.''
   Manly Molpus, institute president, said the industry organization
``has supported and continues to support the fundamental thrust of
the changes envisoned in the law'' but that there is ``clearly a
need to rethink'' the proposal.
   The USDA period for public comments on the proposal runs through
Feb. 2. Molpus said the industry doesn't go along with ``the notion
that a rule should be finalized hastily in the face of so many
unanswered and unresolved questions.''
   As proposed, the new rule would apply to plants that make
frankfurters, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores of
other processed items that include meat and poultry. The proposed
rule would not apply to slaughter plants, which would remain under
continuous federal inspection.

<HEAD>Former Ambasador Says Chilean Army General Ordered Letelier Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former diplomat testified that he was
told the person behind the 1976 assassination of dissident Orlando
Letelier is a former government official sought by the United States
in the case.
   Former envoy Jose Miguel Barros, in testimony before a local
judge, said the mastermind was identified to him as Gen. Manuel
Contreras Sepulveda, former head of the nation's secret police.
   The U.S. Justice Department for years has been seeking the
extradition of Contreras and his top aid, Col. Pedro Espinoza, on
charges of ordering the assassination of Letelier and an American
aide, Ronnie Moffitt.
   The two were killed Sept. 21, 1976, when a remote-control bomb
blew up their car in Washington, D.C.
   Barros was one of seven former officials questioned last week at
the request of the U.S. Justice Department.
   Local newspapers carried the testimony in today's editions, and
Barros confirmed the accounts in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   Barros told Judge Julio Banados that air force Gen. Enrique
Montero told him during a meeting in the late 1970s that ``this
genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate
Letelier.''
   Barros said Montero, who was then undersecretary of the Interior
Ministry, told him he was referring to Contreras.
   At the time of the killing, Contreras was chief of a feared
secret police agency, the National Intelligence Directorate.
   Barros said that according to his information, military President
Augusto Pinochet was not aware of the assassination plot. Barros
testified he was told by another participant in the meeting, former
Foreign Minister Miguel Schweitzer, that Pinochet was not aware of
the alleged plot.
   Schweitzer said Pinochet ``asked Contreras three times privately
and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to
do with the Letelier case, and Contreras said no,'' Barros testified.
   Pinochet later ordered administrative sanctions against Contreras
``for lying to the president,'' Barros said.
   Letelier was a former Cabinet minister and U.S. ambassador for
the leftist government toppled by Pinochet in a bloody 1973 coup. He
was among Pinochet's most influential critics abroad.
   The Chilean Supreme Court rejected the U.S. extradition request
in 1979, saying there was insufficient evidence that Contreras and
Espinoza were involved in the assassination.
   An American who worked for Contreras' agency, Michael Townley,
confessed in a plea-bargain in Washington to planting the bomb on
the order of superiors.
   Army Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios fled Chile in 1987 and
surrendered to U.S. authorities. He confessed to being an accomplice
to the killing and implicated Contreras and Espinoza, both now
retired.
   The U.S. government has accused Chile of not cooperating in the
case and earlier this month invoked a 1914 bilateral treaty that
calls for international arbitration of disputes that cannot be
resolved by other means.
   Foreign Minister Hernan Errazuriz Tuesday criticized the move.
``We energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that we
are handling seriously and professionally,'' he said.
   The government had not decided how to respond to the move, he
said.
   Under the terms of the 1914 treaty, the dispute would be handed
over to a commission associated with the international court of The
Hague, Netherlands.

<TEXT>
   Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament
and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party,
resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of
ship 12 years ago.
   Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down
because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona''
scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a
parliamentary committee.
   Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of
former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19.
   Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch,
the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian
Ocean. Six sailors died.
   The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a
uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
   The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only
scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to
collect the insurance money.
   Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and
insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria,
the Philippines and Latin America.
   In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend
of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz
criticized him.
   Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in
February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious
posts in Austria.
   ``My decision is a personal one and it is politically
motivated,'' Gratz told the house.
   ``If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take
a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of
parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context
in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council
(parliament) in such a way as is his duty.'' In past newspaper
stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from
abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment
was for a uranium processing plant.
   Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping
Proksch in several other ways. Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear
before the parliamentary investigation committee.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian Premier Hun Sen today rejected
the idea of an international peacekeeping force in his country,
saying ``Cambodia can help itself'' as Vietnamese forces withdraw.
   Also today, China's official Xinhua news agency said Cambodian
guerrillas had demanded Vietnam produce a timetable for its pullout
from Cambodia.
   Xinhua quoted the guerrillas' Radio Democratic Kampuchea as
saying Vietnam's withdrawal should take place according to a
publicized timetable with international supervision.
   The guerrillas' main international sponsor, China, has made
similar demands. Vietnam has promised to withdraw all its troops by
September 1989, but it has not given a timetable to show how the
withdrawal will proceed.
   Vietnam's Embassy in Beijing said Vietnamese and Chinese
officials reached some agreements during talks last week, but it did
not say if those included an agreement on a timetable.
   Hun Sen made his comments before meeting with Thai leaders,
including Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, Foreign Minister
Siddhi Savetsila and army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.
   A Thai government spokesman, Suvit Yodmani, said the talks were a
``frank discussion'' but stressed they did not constitute Thai
recognition of the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.
   Chatichai ``just wants to get to know Hun Sen because Hun Sen
later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government,
hopefully when there is peace'' in Cambodia, Suvit told reporters.
   He said both sides agreed that warring Cambodian factions all
must attend peace talks on Cambodia next month in Indonesia.
   Thailand has shunned the Phnom Penh government since its creation
10 years ago following the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. It has
backed a three-party guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese and
Phnom Penh troops in Cambodia.
   The international peacekeeping force was part of a peace proposal
by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the guerrilla coalition.
   ``I think Kampuchea (Cambodia) does not need an international
peacekeeping force because Cambodia can help itself, but other
countries must help end all military aid to (Khmer Rouge leader) Pol
Pot'' and to the resistance, Hun Sen told reporters.
   He said Sihanouk's proposal would lead to the return to power of
the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its 1975-78 rule. The Khmer Rouge is one of the parties in
the guerrilla coalition.
   Stepped up initiatives on Cambodia have come as Vietnamese forces
withdraw from the country, raising fears the powerful Khmer Rouge
could regain power.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to drive the
pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge from power, claims it now has about 50,000
troops in Cambodia and has set September 1989 as a target date for
pulling out all its forces.
   This month in Beijiing, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders began
talks on the Cambodian conflict in the first face-to-face meeting of
high-level officials from the two countries in more than nine years.
   Hun Sen also said today he was ready to discuss with the United
States the issue of Americans missing in action in the Indochina war
and said the discussions could take place in Bangkok.
   The United States, which lists 83 Americans as MIA in Cambodia,
does not recognize the Hun Sen government.
   Washington has enjoyed cooperation from Vietnam and Laos in the
effort to resolve the fates of Americans missing in the war, but
there have been no known official contacts on the issue with Phnom
Penh.

   Hours before his execution, Ted Bundy coolly
traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood
glimpses of violent pornography became ``an addiction'' that grew
until fantasy exploded into reality.
   The 42-year-old law school dropout, whose bizarre mixture of
intelligence, charm and homicidal bloodlust was the subject of five
books and a TV movie, also warned before his execution Tuesday that
there were others like himself.
   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people like
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,
by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' Bundy
said in a videotaped interview Monday.
   Bundy, who after a decade of denial confessed to murdering at
least 23 young women since the mid-1970s, said he deserved his
punishment. His execution in the electric chair at Florida State
Prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people who stood in a
field across from the penitentiary.
   ``I don't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... (but) I
deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,''
Bundy said in the interview with James Dobson, a religious
broadcaster and psychologist.
   He said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to
protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography, TV
violence, X-rated movies.
   Although he said he felt remorse for the sex-related murders,
which authorities believes could total 50 or more nationwide, Bundy
said, ``There is no way in the world that killing me is going to
restore those beautiful children to their parents.''
   Detectives in Washington, Idaho, Colorado and Utah have said in
the past week that Bundy has confessed to 23 killings there but that
he did not provide names for all of the victims. But an FBI agent
gave a higher number in a story published today.
   The Miami Herald reported that FBI agent Bill Hagmeier told
Florida prosecutor Jerry Blair that Bundy's confessions closed the
books on 13 killings in Washington, Utah and Colorado; provided
information that may never be confirmed on 14 more cases in
Washington, Utah, Idaho, California, Vermont and Pennsylvania, and
touched on at least 20 more slayings in various states dating back
to 1969.
   Added to the three Florida killings of which Bundy was convicted,
this would put the number of victims to Bundy to at least 50, all
girls or young women.
   Hagmeier, a specialist on serial killers who interviewed Bundy
last weekend, could not immediately be reached for comment today. He
checked out of his Starke motel this morning to return to his
Virginia headquarters.
   But Blair confirmed today that Hagmeier had given him those rough
figures.
   Including the Florida killings, Blair said, ``there were 30,
based on Bundy's statements, that he appeared to be clearly linked
... and perhaps up to another 20 where he was a suspect or a
probable, I think, is the terminology he used.''
   ``I don't know that it's far off from the figures everybody has
bandied about anyway,'' Blair said today. ``Those are the figures
I've heard for many years. I don't think we'll ever know exactly how
many.''
   Handcuffed and sitting at a table across from Dobson, Bundy
alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29-minute interview. He was
dressed in the peach-colored, short-sleeved shirt worn by Death Row
inmates.
   He appeared to ponder each question carefully, sometimes pausing
at length before answering articulately.
   Dobson, who has a daily radio program heard on 1,200 radio
stations, asked about the rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach, for which Bundy was executed.
   ``What did you feel after that?'' Dobson asked.
   Bundy held his hands to his face, closed his eyes and thought for
a long time before responding: ``I can't talk about that right now.
... It's too painful . ... I can't begin to understand the pain that
the parents of these children (felt).
   ``I don't ask them to forgive me. I'm not asking for it. That
kind of forgiveness is of God.''
   Prodded by Dobson to explore the sources of his violence, Bundy
said that during his murder rampages ``the unique thing about how
this worked ... is I still felt in my regular life the full range of
guilt and remorse about other things.''
   But the murders, he said, were ``compartmentalized'' in his
brain, a ``very well focused, very sharply focused area that was a
black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that
crack hole just disappeared.''
   He emphasized he didn't blame pornography for his actions and
took full responsibility. But he said hard-core pornography, fueled
by alcohol, ``guided and shaped'' what he did.
   ``I have lived in prison for a long time now, and I've met a lot
of men who were motivated to violence just like me. And without
exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography,''
he said.
   Claiming he was ``essentially a normal person'' who grew up in a
good home, Bundy said:
   ``People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have
been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular
pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular
families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any
house today.''
   But Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a psychiatrist who examined Bundy as
part of a last-ditch attempt to save him from execution, said
Bundy's first home was that of his maternal grandparents, with a
grandfather who was ``an extremely violent and frightening
individual.'' The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their
tails, beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously,
the New Haven, Conn., psychiatrist said.
   Lewis said a cousin told her that when Bundy was a preschooler in
the home in Philadelphia, he used to sneak into a greenhouse where
his grandfather's pornography was kept and read it.
   In the interview, Bundy said his desire to murder ``happened in
stages, gradually. ... Once you become addicted to (pornography),
and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of
addiction, I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more
graphic kinds of material.
   ``You keep craving something that is harder, harder, something
which, which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you
reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that
jumping-off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing
it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at
it.
   ``In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process, then at
a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say crystallizing,
making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside.
... a building up of this destructive energy.''
   After committing his first murder, Bundy said, he was
``absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something like
that.''
   ``It was like coming out of some horrible trance,'' Bundy said.
``It was like being possessed by something so awful, so alien.
   ``But then the impulse to do it again would come back even
stronger.''
   Gene Williams, owner of the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home, said he
accepted custody of the body, but no funeral was planned. He would
not give any details on arrangements, including whether there would
be burial or cremation.

<HEAD>Shultz Suggests Eeasing Soviet Trade Restrictions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, before
leaving office, suggested the Bush administration consider easing
trade controls on the Soviet Union if it meets the Feb. 15 deadline
for withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan, a U.S. official said
today.
   Shultz, who stepped down last week to be succeeded by James A.
Baker III, made the suggestion in a letter to Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci, who also resigned with the advent of the Bush
administration.
   Carlucci, in a reply letter to Shultz, did not commit himself to
a position to be passed on to his designated successor, John G.
Tower, and suggested the trade issue be handled without a
recommendation by the new administration, the official said.
   ``The allies are interested in easing the sanctions, but I do not
know if it's a top agenda item for the Bush administration,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet Union moved its troops into Afghanistan in December
1979 to support a Marxist government in Kabul against U.S.-armed
rebels. In 1980, in a punitive gesture, the Carter administration
imposed a ban on trade in sensitive equipment with Moscow.
   Even if the restrictions were removed there still would be
barriers to providing American military technology or equipment to
the Soviet Union.
   Shultz, who supported U.S.-Soviet reconciliation, did not insist
on lifting the sanctions but simply suggested such a step be
considered if the Feb. 15 deadline was met, the official said.
   At the same time, Shultz has favored continuing U.S. arms support
to the Afghan rebels if the Soviets kept arming the Kabul government.
   Shultz's position on the sanctions was ``this is something that
should be discussed,'' the official said. ``But there are always
people in the government who will tell you that sanctions should not
be taken off.''

<HEAD>Democrats Kick Off Legislative Push For Voluntary National Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats kicked off a major
legislative push today for a program of voluntary national service
that would link federal education, job training and housing benefits
to civilian or military service.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and the prime sponsor of the legislation in the Senate,
said the program is ``very much in line'' with President Bush's call
in his inaugural address for more civic responsibility and less
emphaiss on selfish interest.
   Nunn said he hopes the national service proposal will ``awaken a
new spirit of citizenship and civic obligation in America'' by
energizing young people to attack the nation's social needs while
earning education or housing benefits.
   ``This is not a guaranteed benefit,'' he said. ``This is a
guaranteed opportunity to earn a benefit.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said in a
statement that the introduction of the legislative proposal ``moves
the topic of national service to the front'' for consideration by
the 101st Congress.
   Under the program, which would be phased in over five years
beginning in 1990, young volunteers in the ``Citizens Corps'' would
get a $10,000 voucher for each year of civilian service, or a
$12,000 voucher for each year of military service. The civilian
volunteers would be paid subsistence wages of $100 per week plus
health insurance during their period of service.
   The vouchers could be used to finance a college education, to pay
for vocational or job training or as a downpayment on a new home.
After the five-year phase in period, the vouchers would replace most
federal student loans and grants, although such aid still would be
available for those not qualified for the national service program.
   Charles C. Moskos Jr., a Northwestern University professor who
developed much of the legislative proposal, said the program
eventually could cost the federal government $5 billion a year,
based on an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 civilian volunteers and
400,000 military recruits.
   But Moskos said much of that cost would be offset by the
elimination of federal student loans and grants and by the reduction
in federal costs for meeting many of the social needs, such as
providing nursing home care to the elderly, that would be handled by
the young volunteers.
   The legislation, which was introduced in the House by Rep. Dave
McCurdy, D-Okla., specifies that administration of the program would
be handled primarily on the local and state level.

<HEAD>Former President's Son Admits Leaving Threats On Answering Machine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Reagan, the son of the former
president, has admitted he left a profanity-laced, threatening
message on the answering machine of a photographer suing him over
the publication of two pictures.
   Photographer Roger Sandler has filed a complaint against Reagan
over the Jan. 15 phone call.
   Police Lt. Mike Farrell said he spoke with Reagan on Tuesday and
was preparing a report for the district attorney's office for
possible prosecution.
   Sandler said a caller identifying himself as Michael Reagan said,
``You can quote me,'' then launched into a tirade that threatened
physical harm against Sandler and ended with the words, ``I hope
your ... family dies in a plane crash with you in it.''
   The call was made after Reagan received a subpoena from Sandler
for a small claims action in which the photographer is seeking
$1,500 for copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in
Reagan's 1988 book, ``On The Outside Looking In.''
   Sandler said the pictures were not authorized and uncredited.
   Reagan said in a statement Tuesday, ``I regret that he was
uncredited,'' but contended that Sandler has been continually
raising his prices for the photos.
   ``I lost my cool, which I should not have done, and I apologize
for that,'' Reagan said. ``But I actually apologize more to my
friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by
the pressures placed on me because of my position.''
   Sandler said he wouldn't drop the police complaint.
   ``He seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent
temper,'' said Sandler.
   Under California law, it is a misdemeanor to call another
individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or threaten
to inflict injury. The maximum punishment is six months in jail and
a $1,000 fine.

   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on honoraria for members of
Congress:
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the powerful House
Ways and Means Committee, has just returned to Washington from balmy
Palm Springs, Calif., where he delivered speeches to a variety of
lobbyists for the tobacco, outdoor advertising and public power
industries.
   Rostenkowski's reward: up to $2,000 per speech, plus all expenses
for himself and his wife, LaVerne. ... Mind you, this warm weather
sojourn for Rostenkowski was 100 percent legal.
   Nor was it unique. Most of his colleagues in Congress accept
similar speaking fees, or honoraria _ as well as first-class airline
tickets and free hotel stays at exotic vacation spots _ from
lobbyists with an interest in pending legislation. ...
   The lawmakers who accept this kind of hospitality protest, of
course, that their votes can't be bought.
   Perhaps not.
   But if Americans are to have any faith and trust in those they
elect to Congress, then those individuals must be above suspicion.
That's clearly not the case as long as the honoraria gravy train
continues to steam down the track.

   As part of the (Congressional) pay increase deal, the Quadrennial

   Honoraria, ... critics say, (are) legalized bribing by special
interest groups or individuals. ...
   In our opinion, honoraria (do) not necessarily need to be banned
_ although the salary hike should be banned. Honoraria should,
however, be strictly regulated. If honoraria remain legal, we
suggest:
   _Lawmakers should be allowed to accept honoraria only when
Congress is not in session ...;
   _Reporting guidelines for honoraria must be reviewed to make sure
there is strict accounting by members of Congress ... (and);
   _Charities receiving lawmakers' honoraria should be carefully

   In the fairy tale, ``The Emperor's New Clothes,'' it takes a
small boy to point out to the kingdom's spellbound subjects that the
preening emperor is actually naked as a jaybird in his fine new suit
of ``invisible thread.''
   With similar brutal honesty, dissident Andrei Sakharov is now
playing the role of unofficial conscience for the Soviet Union,
informing the world that President Mikhail Gorbachev's celebrated
new policies of restructuring, openness and democratization may have
been written in invisible ink. ...
   But Sakharov's warning should slow the rush to anoint Gorbachev
as a born-again champion of human rights.
   The United States and western Europe must closely monitor his
treatment of domestic political opponents and make it clear that
deeds must match words if he expects anyone else to come to his
party in 1991.

   The Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune on Vietnam and Cambodia:
   In the musical ``Oliver!'' there is a number in which that
charming villain, Fagin, sings, ``I'm reviewing, the situation ...''
and, after considering the possible consequences, concludes, ``I
think I'd better think it out again.''
   This would be a good approach for the Bush administration to take
toward the U.S. policy of pressing for Vietnamese withdrawal from
Cambodia.
   An oversimplified foreign policy would call for all Communist
forces to withdraw from countries where they don't belong. ...
   What we may not have thought through is the new agony which may
be imposed on the Cambodians if the Vietnamese withdraw.
   Our long war in Vietnam conditioned us to consider that country's
Communist regime the worst of all possible alternatives. But a good
case can be made for the proposition that the Cambodians were
considerably worse off under the bloody Khmer Rouge regime, 1975-79,
than they have since been under Vietnamese occupation.
   George Bush and his adviser would do well to think it out again.

   Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on gun control:
   Few crimes more tragically illustrate the lunacy of this nation's
gun fetish than the slayings of those five schoolchildren in
California by a misfit wagging an AK-47 assault rifle.
   Such weapons are built for one purpose: to kill as many as
quickly as possible.
   Yet they are readily available for sale _ and the National Rifle
Association irrationally opposes any restrictions on selling such
killer semi-automatic weapons.
   The gun lobby, which has such success in convincing Congress the
nation should be awash in weapons, might find it beyond its
persuasive powers to explain to the parents of those five children
why they had to be put in jeopardy so Bubba could blast away at beer
cans at a 40-rounds-per-minute or greater clip.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on gun control:
   Our gun-crazed society has claimed five more victims. Five more
innocent lives. Five more children. ...
   The violent, gut-wrenching, purposeless plot seems always the
same: A maniac with a gun goes berserk and opens fire on
unsuspecting and innocent victims.
   Sometimes it's in a restaurant; sometimes its on the freeway. On
(Jan. 17), it happened to take place at a California elementary
school during recess. ...
   We all share the blame, some of us more than others _ but none of
us more than the National Rifle Association. The NRA has
consistently and effectively thwarted or resisted every attempt to
enact even the barest restraints on gun ownership.
   And the NRA, skilled in guerrilla intimidation, has done so by
transforming state and federal politicians into spineless jellyfish
while most of the rest of us just stand by counting victims in
massacre stories. ...
   We urge each and every one of you to call and-or write our
lawmakers and demand that they put an end to this senseless violence.
   Insist, at the very least, on a seven-day waiting period before
guns are sold. Demand tough screening procedures. Require a ban of
such killing machines as the AK-47 and other weapons that serve no
purpose other than to slaughter people.
   Like it or not, the blood of those five innocent children is on

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on George Bush's presidency:
   The phrase ``kinder, gentler,'' endlessly repeated as it has
already been, is now functioning as a key expectation of the Bush
administration. ...
   Part of (President) Bush's program could cause him trouble. He
wants a kinder nation without more spending on domestic programs,
and, of course, ``no new taxes.''
   Rather, like (Ronald) Reagan, though a bit more plausibly, he
lauds the ``thousand points of light,'' the volunteer groups
fighting poverty, homelessness and hunger.
   The trouble is, charity has never fulfilled the role Reagan, and
now Bush, have assigned it. ``Relief,'' as it was called during the
Great Depression, gave people a free meal but did not cure the lack
of schooling and jobs which produced often hopeless conditions of
poverty.
   Only a full scale commitment by government to, yes, the welfare
state, can ever truly be expected to cure poverty. ...
   Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty program ever
devised. Before it began, nearly 7 in 10 older Americans lived in
poverty. Now fewer than 1 in 10 do. But such solutions aren't cheap:
Social Security pays out $200 billion in retirement benefits every
year. ...
   Don't expect any such radical move in Bush's first year. But if
he takes his own advice seriously, eventually he will have to change
his mind, and his policies.

   Asbury Park (N.J.) Press on President Bush's views on race
relations:
   It is hardly a secret that (former President) Reagan has never
been sensitive to the plight of poor blacks and other minorities in
this country. Nor has he taken pains to conceal this disinterest.
   That's why it was so refreshing to hear (President) Bush speak
out ... on what (the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s) message means to
him.
   (Bush called) the slain civil rights leader ``a great gift'' from
God.
   Then Bush pledged to the American people that ... he will strive
to ensure ``that bigotry, and indifference to disadvantage will find
no safe home on our shores, in our public life, in our
neighborhoods, or in our home, and that Reverend King's dream for
his children and ours will be fulfilled.''
   That's plain talk that anybody can understand. After eight years
of worsening race relations, it was a statement the nation needed to
hear.
   One thing is clear: festering racial tension ... will never be
eased without strong and unambiguous leadership from the White House.

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on President Bush's bipartisan breeze:
   Like many of his predecessors, President George Bush extended a
congenial hand to Congress and the country ... during his inaugural
address.
   ``A new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be made
new again,'' he said. ...
   And he has assembled a Cabinet of D.C. insiders who know their
way around. At first glance, the next four years appear ripe for
compromise and reconciliation.
   But addressing America's challenges will require more than
congeniality and a sound group of advisors. It'll take guts.
   Deficits, as Bush said, must come down. But they won't if he and
his budget director don't get more serious about taxes. ...
   Bush wants to be known as the ``education president.'' That costs
money.
   His ``kinder, gentler nation'' that addresses the homeless, AIDS,
children, ... affordable housing, etc. has a hefty price tag too.
   A teetering savings and loan industry must be shored up, and that
won't be cheap. ...
   But it will be hard for us to rally around a breeze. Bush's call
for bipartisanship, however, is another matter. If he produces
results from a warmer relationship, that's someting Americans can
embrace.

George Bush. A fitting finale would be for Reagan to stand up in the
saddle on a white stallion, wave his Stetson and gallop off into the
sunset. A movie-like ending for our first actor-turned-president. ...
   It's hard not to think about the Reagan years in terms of a movie.
   Reagan leaves office an immensely popular figure, a leader who
kept smiling and waving while others fell around him. From James
Watt to Ed Meese, his administration was plagued by friends and
followers miscast in their appointed roles.
   But no one ever seemed to blame Reagan for the troubles his
appointed administrators caused. He was the star, the likeable guy
no matter how bad his supporting cast was.
   Reagan was fond of using anecdotes and stories to illustrate and
build support for his views. Listening to him speak was almost like
watching movie clips. In fact, some of his anecdotes actually were
movie clips, but nobody seemed to mind his ability to confuse
fiction and fact. ...
   All in all, the Reagan years have been like an uneven movie
script. There have been holes in the plot and bad casting in some
roles, but the leading man managed to carry it off.

   Engeleiter has seen and known well many people who can benefit

<HEAD>Environmentalists' Suit Reinstated, But Injunction On Timber Sales
Lifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has reinstated a
lawsuit seeking to block logging near spotted owl nests on
government land in Oregon.
   The 3-0 ruling Tuesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
was a partial victory for environmentalists, whose suit had been
dismissed by a federal judge in Portland.
   But the appeals court also lifted its ban on logging of so-called
``old-growth'' timber _ timber from virgin or long-established
stands _ near spotted owl sites, at least until the lawsuit is
decided.
   That section of the ruling prompted timber industry lawyer Mark
Rutzick also to claim victory.
   There are 289 spotted owl sites within the timber sale area on
the western slope of the Cascades, said attorney Victor Sher of the
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.
   The suit contends logging of old-growth timber would eliminate
the birds by destroying their habitat.
   The spotted owl, which lives in northern California, Oregon and
Washington, is not an endangered species under federal law, although
Sher said the Fish and Wildlife Service is under court order to
reassess the bird's status by May 1.
   Environmental groups regard the spotted owl as an ``indicator''
species, whose reduction in a given region is a signal that other
forms of life are threatened.
   While removing the ban it imposed last June on new logging of
old-growth fir within 2.1 miles of a spotted owl site, the court
said environmental groups could ask a federal judge to forbid sales
from specific sites as they are proposed.
   The timber industry blamed the court's previous order for the
loss of 1,000 lumber and plywood mill jobs, but Sher disputed that.
   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye in Portland had ruled previously
that a 1987 law prohibited the environmentalists from suing. That
finding was largely reversed by the appeals court.

<HEAD>Union Members Seek Repeal of FAA Rule Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Machinists' Union members fanned out across
Capitol Hill on Wednesday to lobby for repeal of a Federal Aviation
Administration rule change that would allow U.S. airlines to handle
more aircraft maintenance at foreign repair stations.
   About 250 union members sought congressional support for
legislation introduced by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif., that
would repeal the FAA rules change.
   On Nov. 22, 1988, the FAA revised Federal Air Regulation 145 to
eliminate a rule that limited foreign repair to work on aircraft
which are used in operations conducted completely or in part outside
the United States. Under the change, aircraft flown on U.S. domestic
routes can also be repaired at foreign work stations.
   John Peterpaul, transportation vice president of the Machinists'
Union, said the two main issues were jobs and safety.
   ``You're talking about a potential here for thousands, tens of
thousands of jobs to be lost,'' Peterpaul said. About 90,000 of the
union's 600,000 members work in the aviation industry.
   Peterpaul said the safety issue has become ``very, very
distressing'' in view of recent incidents involving aging U.S.
airliners, including sudden in-flight disintegration of aircraft
fuselages and loss of engines.
   ``An airplane doesn't make any money on the ground _ it's always
got to be up in the sky,'' he said. ``This competitiveness that's
been created as a result of deregulation I think is one of the main
culprits involved _ why some of these carriers have gotten so lax in
some of their maintenance.''
   Mineta said that ``prior to the rule change, the ability of
airlines to get their domestic aircraft serviced abroad was quite
limited.''
   With the change, however, ``United States domestic aircraft will
now be able to be maintained overseas ... on a free and open basis,
without prior approval,'' he said.
   ``Let's not mince words,'' Mineta told a union gathering. ``You
know that this is bad policy, I know that this is bad policy. And
those new rules should be repealed.''

   A moderate earthquake shook the
gold fields of the Orange Free State today and was followed by
avalanches at one mine that killed two miners and injured four,
officials said.
   Anglo American Corp., the nation's largest mining company, said
it did not know if the avalanches were caused by the quake, which
measured 4.5 on the Richter scale.
   The earthquake struck at 12:15 p.m. and was centered at Welkom,
in the heart of the Orange Free State mining area, said Luis
Fernandes, chief of the South African Seismological Network in
Pretoria.
   The quake was felt 280 miles to the east, in the coast city of
Durban, Radio South Africa reported.
   Anglo American said after the quake, avalanches occurred in the
No. 3 shaft of its President Brand mine, killing two men and
injuring four.
   The company said the shaft continued to operate, despite
extensive damage to the underground infrastructure.
   The South African Press Association said items were thrown from
store shelves, windows shattered and walls cracked in buildings in
the industrial areas around Welkom.
   Radio South Africa said people rushed from buildings, ceilings
collapsed and shelves overturned in the area, but no injuries were
reported. The report said most businesses in Welkom were closed and
multistory buildings were evacuated.
   OK Bazaars, a national supermarket chain, said its store in
Welkom will remain closed until construction experts analyze the
structural damage from the quake. The company said a pregnant woman
in the store at the time of the temblor was treated at a local
hospital for shock.
   The press association said an aftershock was felt 20 minutes
later in Welkom and surrounding towns.

   Art collectors, dignitaries and those who
surrounded Salvador Dali during his last reclusive years today
attended funeral services for the artist, who was buried under the
museum where his first exhibition was held.
   Several thousand onlookers applauded as four pallbearers in red,
blue and gold outfits designed by the artist carried his coffin from
a church to the Theater-Museum. It was placed in a marble tomb in
the floor.
   The museum is a former municipal theater where the surrealist
artist first showed his paintings to the public in 1918.
   The tomb dug Sunday, the day before Dali died, is below Dali's
floor-to-ceiling work, ``Lincoln in Dali Vision,'' a giant nude
painting of his late wife, Gala, that turns into a portrait of
Abraham Lincoln when seen from across a courtyard.
   Earlier, a Catalan-language funeral service was held for Dali in
the nearby 14th century Roman Catholic Church, where he was baptized
84 years ago.
   ``Salvador, now that you have found the beauty with which you
have tried to surround yourself, we wish you a perfect rest and
peace,'' said parish priest Narciso Costabella.
   Spanish Culture Minister Jorge Semprun, Catalan regional
government president Jordi Pujol, Dali's cousin Montserrat Domenech
and close friends of the painter joined townspeople in the small
church.
   Dali died in Figueras Hospital of heart failure brought on by
respiratory problems and pneumonia.
   He left an estate estimated at $87.7 million. The estate's exact
value is difficult to calculate because of the erratic prices of
20th century art and the widespread existence of forgeries.
   Dali's will reportedly divides his estate among the governments
of Figueras, Catalonia and Spain. Under Spanish law, it cannot be
read until at least 15 days after his death.
   A major question is whether private collectors own the lucrative
reproduction rights for their Dali works.
   ``I'm here because of a 45-year-old friendship, to pay my
respects to a dear friend and that's all,'' said A. Reynolds Morse,
owner of the largest private Dali collection outside Spain in his
St. Petersburg, Fla., museum.
   The American collector told The Associated Press he did not want
to discuss possible legal battles until after the mourning period
was over.
   Also in town for the funeral was Robert Descharnes, a French
photographer who had been close to Dali since the early 1980s and
was the principal merchant for his works.
   The Spanish press has implied that Descharnes, the author of what
is considered the most complete catalogue of Dali's works, kept the
painter in seclusion and controlled everything around him.
   Decharnes has called the accusations ``absolutely wrong.'' He
administers the Dutch-based company Demart, which owns reproduction
rights to Dali's works until 2004.
   Italian collector Giuseppe Alboretto, who owns more than 500 Dali
works, said today he had prepared legal action against Decharnes,
who he said had prevented him from visiting the painter.
   Figueras Mayor Mariano Lorca said he did not know whether Dali's
only living close relative, his sister Ana Maria Dali, figured in
the will.
   The Barcelona daily La Vanguardia reported that the sister
planned a private funeral service in her home in nearby Cadaques.
   A founder of the surrealist movement in the early 1930s, Dali was
the last of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that
included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro. A fervent Catalan, he returned
to his native region in 1948 after living in Madrid, Paris and
several U.S. cities.
   In later years he was known as much for his outrageous
personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings.
   Dali went into seclusion and sank into depression when his wife,
manager and muse, Gala, died in 1982.
   He had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a
wheelchair and fed through tubes since he was badly burned in a 1984
fire.

   A sheriff brought 69 inmates to the Capitol today
in a protest against jail overcrowding, but the prisoners were sent
back on orders from Gov. Joe Frank Harris without even getting out
of their buses.
   ``It was totally irresponsible on the part of the sheriff and was
reckless endangerment of the public,'' said Harris spokeswoman
Barbara Morgan.
   The two busloads of DeKalb County inmates arrived as part of a
protest by Georgia sheriffs, who blame jail overcrowding on the
state's practice of forcing local jails to accept state inmates
until prison space opens up.
   The buses pulled up to a curb outside the Capitol but left about
15 minutes later.
   DeKalb County Sheriff Pat Jarvis said that he never intended to
take the prisoners into the Capitol, that the inmates were
nonviolent and that he had informed police and Capitol security
guards in advance.
   ``This is not a sideshow, this is business,'' he said.
   Jarvis said the demonstration was in support of a Senate bill
that would let counties decide whether to accept overflow state
prisoners. Currently, counties are paid $15 a day per prisoner,
which Jarvis said is about half the actual cost.
   ``We are a holding facility, not a prison,'' said Jarvis.
   Asked where the state should put the 4,000-plus prisoners it has
in county jails, Jarvis said, ``That's not my problem. Where am I
going to put them?''
   Corrections Commissioner David Evans has asked for 7,100 new
prison beds in the fiscal year beginning July 1 to ease
overcrowding, but Harris included no money in his $7 billion budget
proposal for new prison space.
   Bud Cody, executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs Association,
said half of Georgia's jails are overcrowded with state prisoners at
a cost of $27 million a year to local taxpayers.
   ``We've got a very desperate situation,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, overcrowded jails in Colquitt and Turner
counties were the scenes of minor uprisings, and overcrowding was a
factor in recent disturbances at prisons in Milledgeville and at the
Hall County jail.
   ``These things are going to continue to pop up as long as we've
got too many prisoners,'' Jarvis said.

<HEAD>Renegade Unit Reportedly Ignores IRA Order To Disband</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with slaying today. No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army is engulfed in a serious
internal dispute because its most ruthless unit apparently has
refused to obey the IRA leadership's order to disband, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Times of London quoted unidentified IRA supporters as saying
the order stemmed from a dispute over the unit's killing of
Protestant civilians. The unit will likely continue operating as a
renegade group, the newspaper said.
   Also today, a 26-year-old construction worker was slain in the
Northern Ireland city of Belfast by two gunmen, and police said they
were investigating whether it was another incident of sectarian
violence.
   On Tuesday, another London newspaper, The Independent, quoted
unidentified IRA sources as saying the guerrilla organization had
ordered the unit in question disbanded and disarmed because of the
Protestant slayings.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite the province
with the Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   The controversial unit reportedly is based just across the border
from Northern Ireland around the towns of Ballyshannon and Bundoran.
   The Times said the unit had coordinated the bombing of an annual
memorial service for World War dead at Enniskillen in County
Fermanagh on Nov. 8, 1987. The attack, which killed 11 civilians,
provoked worldwide condemnation of the guerrillas. The IRA admitted
it made a grave error and apologized.
   The Independent reported that one of the killings that angered
IRA leaders was that of Harold Keyes, a 23-year-old Protestant from
County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. Two gunmen killed Keyes Jan.
15 as he visited his Roman Catholic girlfriend at Ballintra in the
republic, 10 miles across the border.
   Keyes was a former reservist with the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force, but left
the force three years ago. Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland
condemned the slaying as ``brutal and senseless.''
   The Independent said another Protestant civilian victim of the
unit was a 21-year-old Fermanagh woman, Gillian Johnston, who was
slain in March.
   The unit said at the time that its target had been her brother,
who the group claimed was a member of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a
locally recruited British Army unit in Northern Ireland.
   The family and police denied the brother was a member of the
force, and a later IRA statement said the killing had been a mistake.
   The Times said the unit is believed to have seven members,
including a prosperous Irish businesswoman who acted as its
intelligence officer.
   It said the unit has strong links to the Irish National
Liberation Army, a breakaway Marxist rival of the IRA. The newspaper
quoted IRA supporters as saying the unit might switch allegiance to
the rival.
   In today's slaying, Press Association, Britain's domestic news
service, identified the victim as David Dornan from Ballynahinch, 15
miles south of Belfast. The news service said Dornan was a
Protestant and that police thought the shooting may have been a case
of mistaken identity.
   He was operating excavating equipment in a Protestant
neighborhood in Lisburn near Belfast when the gunmen stepped from
behind bushes and opened fire, police said.

<HEAD>Ireland's Foremost Architect Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Scott, Ireland's foremost
architect who designed his country's shamrock-shaped pavilion at the
1939 New York World's Fair, has died at the age of 83.
   Scott, who died Tuesday at home, designed some of Dublin's
best-known modern buildings, including the state broadcasting
company's headquarters, the central bus station, and the home of the
Abbey Theater, Ireland's premier playhouse.
   The World's Fair building, named best pavilion by an
international jury, won him global recognition, and Mayor Fiorello
La Guardia awarded Scott honorary citizenship of New York.
   A lover of the writings of James Joyce, Scott built his home by
the seaside south of Dublin next to the Martello Tower, where the
novel ``Ulysses'' opens. In the 1950s he and two friends purchased
the distinctive cylindrical tower to turn it into a Joyce museum.
   He was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects
and in 1975 received the Royal Institute of Architects Gold medal,
the only Irishman to win the prestigious British honor.
   Born June 24, 1905 in Drogheda, Scott was an accomplished actor
before taking up architecture full-time. Specializing in the plays
of Sean O'Casey, he took the lead role in the 1927 Broadway
production of ``The Plough and the Stars.''
   His wife, Patricia, died in 1969. He is survived by four sons and
a daughter.

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered four government censors to stand
trial on obscenity charges for clearing the way for the TV showing
of the film ``9{ Weeks'' a year ago, newspapers reported Wednesday.
   They were charged for having reduced the 18-year age limit for
viewing the film in movie houses to 14, thus making it eligible to
be shown on TV.
   The film stars Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger and focuses on
their heated sexual relationship.
   Rome's La Repubblica newspaper quoted prosecutor Alfredo Rossini
as saying that the lowering of the movie house age limit allowed TV
screening of ``sensually violent and erotic scenes'' to a potential
audience of all ages.
   The commercial Canale 5 network showed the film in prime time
Dec. 16, 1987.
   Newspapers said the court stepped in after receiving complaints
about the TV showing.
   The trial has been set for March 8.

   Sheila Marshall of Normanton in central England won $1,122,180.
   On Monday, Mrs. Marshall had been told the company where she had

where he works.
   Mrs. Marshall, 49, said she used the family's star signs _
Gemini, Virgo and Pisces _ to help pick the lucky numbers.
   Marshall, 48, said the couple had been planning a silver wedding

<TEXT>
   People living near a volcano in northern Japan that
came to life last month for the first time in 26 years are bracing
themselves for another powerful eruption.
   Scientists studying the volcano said Wednesday there were signs
another major eruption was developing.
   ``Based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major,
powerful eruption to match'' those that occurred in 1926 and 1962,
said Yoshio Fujii, professor on volcanology and petrology at
Hokkaido University.
   Fujii based his prediction on analysis of rock samples taken from
nearby peaks following the Dec. 19 eruption of the 6,814-foot Mount
Tokachi in central Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.
   Koichi Ueda, an official of Kamifurano-cho, a town of 14,000
people just 15 miles from Mount Tokachi, said 13 town officials were
maintaining an around-the-clock watch.
   No damage or injuries were reported in the Dec. 19 eruption.
   Heat from Mount Tokachi's eruption in 1926 melted almost all the
snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people and
injured another 200 in two nearby villages. A smaller eruption in
1962 killed four people.
   Activity inside Mount Tokachi has intensified since Jan. 9
because magma is rising from deep within the Earth to about 1,650
feet below the crater of the volcano, according to Hiroshi Okada,
head of Hokkaido University's Usu volcano Observatory.
   ``The form of volcanic activity has started changing,''
indicating the possibility of an explosion of magma from the
mountain, Kyodo News Service quoted Okada as saying.

an account Wednesday in the daily newspaper Noticias.
   Onlookers called the natural history museum, and the director,

<HEAD>Lobbying Heating Up Over Soon-To-Expire Steel Import Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new session of Congress signals the
beginning of a lobbying war over whether the United States should
extend soon-to-expire steel import curbs that have helped the
American steel industry become profitable.
   The current import ceilings, which were negotiated in the fall of
1984, expire Sept. 30.
   Already there has been ``a lot of rhetoric'' on whether they
should be renewed, William Reinsch, steel trade expert for Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., said this week.
   ``In terms of parties coming and sitting down, it's just now
beginning to heat up,'' Reinsch said.
   Pressured by the steel industry and by Congress, the Reagan
administration negotiated five-year steel trade agreements with
Japan, South Korea, the European Community and other leading
steel-exporting nations.
   The idea was to give American companies breathing space from
subsidized foreign competitors by pressuring the competitors to
restrict imports on a product-by-product basis.
   USX Corp., Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Steel Co. and other large
steel companies have begun pushing for an extension of the curbs
beyond 1989.
   But with the steel industry turning a second consecutive profit
last year and with some importers complaining of steel product
shortages, it is no sure bet that the large firms will win renewal
of as strong a package of quotas as in 1984.
   Three days before winning the November election, President Bush
pledged to continue the so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements in
some form. But opponents of the plan believe they can make a case
for ending or at least scaling down the import curbs.
   There is little argument that the curbs have aided the steel
industry's revival. Imports have been reduced from 26.4 percent of
the American market in 1984, to about 20.5 percent last year.
Meanwhile, employment and profits were up last year over 1987.
   The issue is whether the quota agreements are still necessary,
and to what degree, if at all, they have harmed other sectors of the
American economy besides steel companies.
   The Precision Metalforming Association, an industry group, says
the availability of steel has been reduced because of the import
curbs. The association represents hundreds of metal product
manufacturers that convert such products as brake pedals and
computer frames from raw steel.
   ``Our position is because of the restrictions on steel supplies _
which cause increases in prices and limited availability _ we would
rather see the most open and competitive steel market possibile,''
spokesman Greg Estell said Monday.
   The steel trade issue has already spawned some angry language.
   After Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., issued a September 1988
paper arguing against continued import ceilings, the American Iron
and Steel Institute soon compiled a 20-page, point-by-point rebuttal.
   In the Jan. 1 rebuttal, the trade association accused Caterpillar
of ``numerous distortions and inaccuracies.'' The paper claimed that
the import curbs ``do not cause steel price increases or otherwise
impede the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers.''

   Joseph B. Ridder, publisher of the San
Jose Mercury News for 25 years and a member of one of the nation's
major newspaper families, died in a Honolulu hospital at age 68, the
newspaper reported today.
   Ridder, who died Monday, had been hospitalized with complications
from emphysema, said brother Daniel Ridder, chairman of the Long
Beach Press-Telegram.
   Ridder was publisher of the Mercury News from 1952 to 1977,
during which the city's population grew from about 100,000 to over
600,000 and circulation of the Mercury and News, then separate
morning and afternoon papers, grew from 73,000 to 211,000.
   He was succeeded by a nephew, P. Anthony Ridder, now president of
Knight-Ridder Inc., parent company of the Mercury News and several
other newspapers, including The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Miami
Herald, The Journal of Commerce and the Detroit Free Press.
   Ridder was born into one of the nation's major newspaper families
in New York City. He attended Canary College in Virginia.
   During World War II, he was promotion director of the Duluth
(Minn.) Herald and News Tribune and general manager of the St. Paul
Pioneer Press and Dispatch.
   The family acquired the San Jose newspaper in 1952. Ridder, then
32, was named publisher.
   Survivors include two brothers. Funeral services were scheduled
for Thursday at Ridder's home in Honolulu.

   Whether for day or evening wear, the broadened shoulders are set
off by deep decolletes and big round buttons. Hemlines stop above
the knee and pants abound, ending above the ankle.
   Even when skirts and dresses showed slits soaring high over the
thigh, the collection spelled class from start to finish.
   Saint-Laurent's 90 creations, modeled to the breathy singing of
Marilyn Monroe, got a warm reception from a packed house that
included French actresses Catherine Deneuve, a Saint-Laurent
regular, and Arielle Dombasle, along with ready-to-wear queen Sonia
Rykiel.
   While other high fashion houses earlier showed the soft and
rounded feminine lines of the 1930s, Saint-Laurent's day wear
flattered the form with his signature structured look.
   Suit jackets were shorter than in previous years, their spartan
style softened by oversized cufflinks and big round buttons.
Underneath were daring blouses in the sheerest of mousseline.
   Saint-Laurent's classic pants, both casual and formal, were the
ultimate in wearability, featuring the generous front and back darts
that hide the imperfections of most mortals.
   The most beautiful designs were the simplest, letting the body
speak for itself. One breathtaking dress appearing in several
different versions for day and night was a simple wrap that tied on
the hip. Others had big brassy buttons running up the bust, down the
buttocks and over the hips.
   Pert pillbox hats and large round earrings polished the look.
   Evening wear was a study in colorful bougainvillea floral
patterns in crepes and chiffons, worn long in draped dresses or
over-the-shoulder, floor-length capes.
   Saint-Laurent's tuxedos were as striking as ever, mixing navy and
black and worn with see-through chiffon blouses.
   Another successful design was an updated version of the sailor
middy shirt, presented in soft navy wools and crisp white linen.
   Guy Laroche also presented his collection Wednesday, and there
was something for everyone who likes to wear dresses.
   The colors exploded on the runway, with bright reds, sunny
yellows and juicy oranges melting into pastel pinks, blues and
gentle greens.
   Like Saint-Laurent, Laroche displayed big shoulders and spiced up
the simplest designs with sexy decolletes in front and back.
   Once the preserve of beachwear, the bustier is everywhere.
Laroche makes them in pink and yellow leather for daytime and in
silk and lace for evening.
   Except for a few cruise-line outfits with wide, flowing sailor
pants draped gorgeously at the waist, Laroche was all dresses, long
and short.
   In daytime wear, hemlines modestly skimmed the knee. There were
big-shouldered safari suits in orange shantung, light wool coat
dresses in Prince of Wales plaid and short leather suits with bolero
jackets.
   Laroche excelled in cocktail and evening wear, using drapery to
highlight hourglass waistlines and curvy hips. The lines were pure
and feminine, with lots of cut-out backs set off by elaborate
embroidery, ruffles and bows.
   Some cocktail dresses had such big bustles, sitting down would be
next to impossible. Others featured asymmetrical hemlines, rising to
midthigh in the front, brushing the floor in the back _ the design
also used in the collection's ``piece de resistance,'' the wedding
dress.

   John Tower faced serious questions about
scaling back Pentagon spending and about his personal ties to
defense contractors as the Senate Armed Services Committee prepared
to open hearings today on his nomination to run the Defense
Department.
   The committee met in executive session this morning, said Christa
Mass, a spokeswoman for Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking
Republican on the committee.
   Details of the meeting were not available.
   The former Texas senator could expect to be treated with special
courtesy by his former colleagues this afternoon in the historic
Senate Caucus Room, site of the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings.
   But the 63-year-old Tower, who emerged as President Bush's
nominee after an exhaustive background check, was certain to be
quizzed on his consulting work for defense contractors and his
private life, as well as on defense policy and overall Pentagon
funding.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Tuesday he expects the hearings to be marked by some
controversy based on the reports that have already been raised in
the media.
   ``There's enough out there,'' Dixon said.
   Confirmation hearings are under way for two other Bush appointees:
   _Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher was warmly
received Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee. Lawmakers
told the Texas oilman he should make the government a more
aggressive advocate for American businesses in the world
marketplace. His nomination is expected to win easy approval from
the committee next week.
   _Today marked the start of hearings on Samuel K. Skinner's
appointment as transportation secretary. In written responses to
questions from the Senate Commerce Committee, the 50-year-old
Illinois transportation administrator said foreign airlines serving
the United States should be forced to meet the same security
requirements as U.S. carriers.
   The Tower hearings are likely to focus in part on the issue of
overall military spending. Former President Reagan asked in his
final budget for $315.2 billion for the Pentagon in fiscal 1990,
which begins Oct. 1. The request represents a 2 percent increase
after inflation.
   But Bush, according to testimony last week from Office of
Management and Budget nominee Richard Darman, is expected to reduce
Reagan's request by an unspecified amount.
   If Bush fails to trim the request, Congress is likely to do so.
In the past four years, Congress has cut military spending increases
to levels below the rate of inflation.
   ``I think they're whistling Dixie if they think they'll get a 2
to 3 percent increase in spending,'' said Rep. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss., a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ``They'll
be fortunate if they get the inflation factor.''
   Tower, a former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also
was certain to be quizzed about his connections to a number of
defense contractors.
   According to public records and associates, Tower's consulting
firm of Tower and Associates has been on annual retainer with
Martin-Marietta, Textron, LTV Aerospace and Defense Co., Rockwell
International and British Aerospace.
   Tower's firm also received about $100,000 a year under a contract
for consulting services to Hicks and Associates, a McLean, Va.-based
aerospace consulting firm headed by Donald Hicks, a former
undersecretary of defense.
   A lengthy FBI background check of Tower pushed his personal life
into the forefront, including his bitter divorce and reports of
drinking and womanizing.
   Bush, in announcing the appointment of Tower, dismissed ``a lot
of rumors that proved to be groundless,'' and said, ``I am totally
satisfied in that regard.''
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Warner, ranking members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said they would read the FBI reports on
all nominees before the hearings.
   Expected to raise the question of Tower's private life is Paul
Weyrich, chairman of Coalitions for America, a conservative think
tank. Weyrich is scheduled to testify before the committee next
Tuesday.
   In an interview last week, Weyrich said he opposes the Tower
nomination because the former senator fails to meet the ethical
standards Bush envisioned for his administration.

   A veteran Cuban diplomat secretly defected to
the United States three months ago after becoming disillusioned with
widespread official corruption and with Cuban support for Marxist
rebels in at least three Latin American countries.
   Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, 35, broke with the revolution last
October when he was granted political asylum by U.S. officials, but
his defection was not publicly disclosed until the State Department
made him available for an interview Tuesday with The Associated
Press.
   Aguililla criticized the corruption that he said Cuban officials
engaged in while he was posted in Syria and Iran and added he was
troubled by the lack of freedom and the ``total militarization'' of
Cuban society.
   The Cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of Aguililla's
allegations on Wednesday but spokesman Angel Pino refused comment.
   President Fidel Castro has acknowledged that corruption in Cuba
is a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution has
produced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer
for social welfare projects at home and in numerous Third World
countries.
   Aguililla, whose diplomatic career spanned 14 years, offered a
rare glimpse into the role Cuba has played in cooperation with
Palestinian radicals in the shadowy international arms trafficking
business.
   Aguililla said that with Palestinian help, Cuba has arranged for
the transport of large quantities of Western-made weaponry to
guerrilla groups in El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile and also
provides training in Cuba for leftist African groups.
   He said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the second
ranking official at the Cuban Embassy in Damascus, he routinely made
trips to Lebanon's Bekka Valley where the trunk of his car was
loaded with rifles, pistols, revolvers and smoke bombs.
   He said Palestinian groups, particularly two pro-Marxist
factions, were the principal source of weaponry, which he was able
to transport back to Syria without a customs check because of the
diplomatic plates on his car.
   On occasion, he said, a top Cuban intelligence officer flew to
Damascus for larger-scale arms transfers.
   Weapons of U.S., Israeli or Italian manufacture were favored
because ``socialist involvement'' in the arms trafficking scheme
could thus be concealed, he said.
   ``The Palestinians were a good source of Western arms because
they had a lot of contacts to get them,'' he added.
   ``The policy of Cuba has always been to export the revolution,''
Aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75-minute
interview.
   Speaking in Spanish while chain-smoking cigarettes, Aguililla
said he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way of
Syria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early
1984.
   He said Cuba assists the Palestinian movement in a number of
ways, including the provision of ``training of a terrorist nature.''
   Palestinians, he said, are trained by Cubans as frogmen and in
the use of ``all types of weaponry'' as well. Non-lethal skills also
are taught, such as how to falsify passports and to engage in
clandestine correspondence through an invisible writing technique.
   Aguililla was assigned last September to be the second ranking
official at the Cuban Embassy in Madagascar. He departed Cuba on
October 10 but at a transit point en route, which he refused to
disclose, he asked for political asylum for his wife and two
children, aged 13 and 10.
   He described Castro as ``paranoid'' and ``capricious'' and said
he was disturbed by widespread evidence of corruption in Cuban
society, sometimes at high levels of government.
   Wilma Espin, a member of the Politburo and head of the Federation
of Cuban Women, once helped herself during a visit to Damascus to a
fund that embassy women had contributed to for parties and toys for
children, he said, adding that she used the money for shopping.
   Orlando Fundora, formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution,
stopped once in Damascus, Aguililla said, and asked him to exchange
money on the black market.
   ``He was supposed to be the model of socialist morality but
nonethless he violated the law of that country,'' Aguililla added.
   The wife of a former Cuban ambassador to Syria, Arturo Barber
Orosco, used to finance shopping expeditions by drawing thousands of
dollars from an embassy fund and saying the money was being used for
``cleaning materials'' for the ambassador's residence, Aguililla
said.

   Attorneys for fired National Security Council
aide Oliver L. North disclosed today they have issued subpoenas in
the Iran-Contra case to three House committees and two members of
the House.
   North attorney Barry Simon said the subpoenas were sent to the
House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees.
   The two members of Congress weren't identified. Defense subpoenas
also were issued for two unidentified House staff members.
   The House, through the general counsel to the clerk, subsequently
moved to quash portions of the subpoenas to the committees. A
22-page court brief said the panels could not allow the ``wholesale
rummaging through the records of the House'' sought by North's
lawyers.
   North's subpoenas require ``surrender of the broadest imaginable
range of privileged documents,'' including ``the whole set of
records'' of the House intelligence panel's investigation of the
resupply operation for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the brief said.
   The committee began the investigation after the October 1986
shootdown of a Contra resupply plane in Nicaragua carrying American
Eugene Hasenfus as one of its crew members.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said with regard to the two
House members subpoenaed: ``We're not going to pull them off the
floor. We're going to have to approach this part of the case with
some degree of accommodation.''
   North's trial is scheduled to get under way next Tuesday,
although an interagency intelligence group is still reviewing
classified documents that both the prosecution and defense want to
use at trial.
   The brief references to subpoenas by North's defense team came at
a court hearing where prosecutors argued in favor of subpoenaing
North's spiral notebooks, which he compiled on a daily basis while
he was at the NSC.
   Gesell said he would decide by Friday whether North should be
compelled to produce the notebooks, portions of which were turned
over to Congress for the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.
   At the court hearing, Simon said the notebooks might be applied
to the portion of the case alleging destruction of documents by
North in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was unfolding.
   Simon said prosecutors might try to link references in the
notebooks to documents that North allegedly destroyed before leaving
the NSC.
   Simon declined to acknowledge that the notebooks existed or were
in North's possession, but he said North is entitled to Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
   The notebooks also delve into North's assistance to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels and his involvement in the Reagan
administration's secret arms shipments to Iran.
   North took the last of the notebooks with him when he was
dismissed on Nov. 25, 1986 after the diversion of Iran arms sale
proceeds to the Contras was uncovered.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has been trying to get the
notebooks since well before North's indictment last year.
   A subpoena for the material was issued through the federal grand
jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair, but was withdrawn after
North was charged, Walsh said in a court filing Monday.
   Walsh said the notes are ``presidential records over which the
United States has complete ownership and control.''
   The notebooks could be used by prosecutors in an attempt to
bolster the portion of the government's case alleging that North
made false statements to Congress by saying that the NSC offered no
tactical advice to the Contras and by denying that he used his
influence to help move supplies to them.
   North's notebooks describe successful efforts to obtain false
end-user certificates from Guatemala stating that arms actually
destined for the Contras were instead for the exclusive use of the
Central American country to which they were being sent. The false
certificates enabled one of North's co-defendants, Richard Secord,
to ship more than 90,000 pounds of East European munitions by
chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to the Contras.
   North's notebooks also touch on his participation in efforts to
secure space at a Salvadoran air base to launch Contra resupply
missions, and the construction of an emergency airstrip in Santa
Elena, Costa Rica, to help open a southern front of Contra military
operations.
   The notebooks also detail North's participation in arranging the
November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
   One charge against North is that he obstructed Congress by
helping to prepare a false chronology that said no U.S. official
learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to
Iran in November 1985.
   In notebook entries for Nov. 20, 1985, several days before the
Hawk missile shipment, North detailed a plan for shipping Hawks to
Iran in exchange for a four-phase release of hostages.

   President Bush indicated today he is
considering a visit to China next month in connection with his trip
to the Far East for the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Bush replied when asked about a report that he
was planning a visit to China, where he served in the 1970s as this
country's first envoy to Beijing.
   The president was responding to a rpeort in the official Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug, which was reported from Beijing.
   The agency, quoting unnamed sources, said Bush would visit China
on Feb. 25-26 following his trip to Tokyo.
   Bush said ``I just don't know yet'' whether he'll go to China.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, responding earlier to the
Yugoslav report, said ``there are no plans at this time'' for such a
trip.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu declined to confirm or
deny whether Bush would be making such a trip.
   ``I would suggest that you wait for the tall thin guy (Bush) to
sing, or the short bald guy (press secretary Marlin Fitzwater) to
tell you that the tall, thin guy has sung,'' he told reporters.
``There is no official announcement of that yet.''
   ``Nothing on the itinerary (of the Far East trip) is ready for
announcement yet,'' he said.
   There has been widespread speculation that Bush would use the
occasion of the Japanese trip to visit both China and South Korea
before returning to Washington from the trip to the Orient.
   His first trip out of the United States as president will be to
Ottawa on Feb. 10, for talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   The Canada trip will be the first outside the United States for
the new president. The White House press office said Tuesday that
Bush and Mulroney ``will discuss bilateral and international issues
of common concern'' during the one-day Ottawa visit.
   China's Foreign Ministry has not yet confirmed the report on
Bush's impending visit, but its spokesman has recently said that the
president ``would be welcome in China,'' Tanjug reported.
   It said Bush will hold talks with Chinese officials on bilateral
and other issues, especially political developments in the Far East.
   Tanjug said Bush, the first U.S. representative in China after
the two countries re-established diplomatic ties, ``is very popular
in Chinese political circles.''
   Bush was chief of the U.S. liaison office in Beijing in 1974-75.

   A survey of scientific studies suggests most
women suffer no lasting emotional trauma from abortion, but the
American Psychological Association says much of the research is
flawed and more studies are needed.
   ``By and large, what you find is that most of the women who have
abortions experience a sense of relief,'' Brian Wilcox, director of
public interest legislation at the APA, said Tuesday in an interview.
   He said the APA survey showed that post-abortion syndrome, a
notion that women are harmed emotionally by abortion, is not a
scientifically or medically recognized disorder.
   However, Olivia Gans, director of the American Victims of
Abortion, said negative findings on the effects of abortion are
absent from the scientific literature because the APA and the
American Medical Association have a pro-abortion bias.
   Thousands of women, she claimed, suffer emotional problems after
undergoing abortion.
   Earlier this month, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said in a
letter to the White House that there was no scientifically sound
evidence showing negative health effects to the 1.5 million women
who get legal abortions annually.
   Both Wilcox and Miss Gans agreed with the position taken by Koop,
and both said there is a need for scientifically valid research.
   Wilcox said APA experts surveyed more than 100 research studies
on the psychological effects of abortion and found that most of the
research was flawed because there were few valid comparisons. For
example, Wilcox said, there are no studies that directly compare the
relative effects on women who chose abortion with those who decide
to bear an unwanted child for adoption, or raise the child out of
wedlock.
   In general, he said, however, the studies do not show any lasting
psychological trauma that can be attributed solely to abortion.
   ``It's clear that the vast majority of women are not going to
experience any significant problems,'' said Wilcox. ``Millions of
women are having abortions and it appears to be a relatively benign
procedure both medically and psychologically. It just depends on the
circumstances surrounding the abortion.''
   Miss Gans said many women suffer from ``post-abortion syndrome''
and experience great difficulty from having an abortion.
   ``Post-abortion syndrome is a theory that has been discussed by
clinicians around the country among those who have seen patterns
emerge,'' she said.
   Professionals are beginning to compile research on it ``but they
are having difficulty getting published,'' said Miss Gans.
   She said the APA and the AMA have a bias toward abortion and a
hostility toward studies that show negative findings about abortion.

   In Motown, where cars are synonymous with life
itself for many, psychologists say a recent skein of reported
roadway shootings has shaken motorists' confidence in their cars as
rolling security.
   Since November, there have been at least 10 random highway
shootings in and around Detroit. Some were roadside snipers, others
stemmed from traffic disputes.
   ``You've got a lot of idiots out there with guns in their cars
and you put that together with publicity and people start taking
shots at each other,'' Assistant Oakland County Prosecutor James
Halushka said.
   ``It certainly makes people anxious and it affects people's
behavior on the road,'' said Emanuel Tanay, a professor of
psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit. ``The car has been
known as a sort of sanctuary but now, that's not the case.''
   The most serious incident occurred Nov. 22, when Michael Warner,
31, of Trenton, was shot and killed while sleeping in a car driven
by his wife on Interstate 75 in Southgate. Police have made no
arrests.
   Since then, there have been reports of shots shattering car
windshields. State police investigators subsequently discovered the
damage was caused by rocks. No serious injuries have been reported.
   It has happened before. In the summer of 1987, at least five
people were killed and 20 injured in an unrelated string of
shootings on Southern California freeways. Some of the incidents
stemmed from traffic disputes while others appeared to be random
sniper attacks.
   Los Angeles area authorities set up a highway violence hot line
to handle calls from worried drivers and special aerial freeway
patrols were established. The shootings later tapered off.
   Michigan authorities have no similar plans. State police are
trying to be more alert but lack the manpower to increase road
patrols, said Lt. David Werner, commander of the state police
freeway post in Detroit.
   Tanay said the media have given the Michigan incidents _ real and
imagined _ unwarranted attention, which has contributed to drivers'
anxiety.
   ``We live in a society where there's violence. Why is it so
shocking that it happens in a car? People die in car crashes
everyday,'' he said.
   Werner also criticized the heavy news coverage of the shootings.
   ``It's my feeling that copy catting always occurs in things of
this type,'' he said. ``I've tried to downplay things of this
nature, though.''
   Authorities say most people now are driving more cautiously to
avoid traffic disputes. But the extent to which driving behavior is
altered depends on the psychological makeup of the particular
individual, said Dr. William Birkhill of Southfield-based Couseling
Associates.
   ``It depends greatly on how much people use denial to protect
themselves,'' Birkhill said. ``Many deal with traumatic events by
denying them. Most people _ if it hasn't happened to them _ they are
able to dismiss the possibility of danger.''
   Catching a highway shooter is difficult, Werner said. ``In most
instances, there are no witnesses and we have few leads to go on.''
   Authorities hope the sentencing of John Rayes, 17, to eight to 20
years in prison for a highway shooting will be a deterrent. Rayes
pleaded guilty Jan. 3 to the shooting of 19-year-old Dawn Lamsa on
I-696 in Madison Heights. Lamsa was wounded in the neck and was
hospitalized for several days.
   Rayes told police he mistook Lamsa for someone he had argued with
at a carnival earlier in the evening.

   Police today defused a crude bomb outside an
abortion clinic.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosive
device found by a parking attendant at the Delta Women's Clinic,
said police spokesman John Bryson. The bomb was concealed by a
manila folder or envelope, he said.
   Police gave no details on the composition of the bomb or say how
powerful it was, but Bryson said, ``It was a makeshift bomb, very
crude.''
   Bryson didn't know how many people were evacuated from the
clinic. Toni Scott, clinic director, did not immediately return a
telephone call.
   The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
were called in to investigate, Bryson said.
   Delta Women's Clinic has been the focus of several recent
anti-abortion demonstrations. More than 70 people were arrested Jan.
14 after blocking entrances.
   On Saturday, the clinic was the stopping point for a peaceful
anti-abortion march marking the 16th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion.

   President Bush today credited the Soviet Union
with ``definite improvement'' in human rights but said the United
States will watch what develops in the months ahead while weighing
whether to carry through with a promise to attend a Moscow summit on
human rights in 1991.
   ``I think we need to look for performance, and there will be time
in which to see performance in that regard,'' he said. He added
``there has been definite improvement in some ways there, but let's
see what develops as we move towards that conference date.''

away from its commitment to attend the Moscow conference but said,
``There's plenty of room for independent analysis'' between now and
1991.
   Bush made his comments in an interview with two reporters as part
of a White House's experiment to make the president available to the
news media in different forums. A transcript of the session was made
public.
   The president hinted he may visit China next month after stopping
in Japan for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito. ``Stay
tuned,'' he said. ``We may have something on that ... yea or nea
before the close of business today, but I just don't know yet.''
   There also is speculation Bush will visit South Korea while in
the Far East.
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _He does not want the Federal Reserve Board to act too strongly
to bring down inflation rates. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that inflation was too high and he would press to reduce it.
   While noting that he had not talked with Greenspan recently, Bush
applauded the upward movement in the stock market and said ``there's
no signals out there in the markets that this economy is in real
trouble. ... I don't want to see us move so strongly against fear of
inflation that we impede growth.''
   _The administration is considering imposing a fee on customers of
savings and loan institutions to help the federal government pay to
insure the troubled S&amp;L industry. ``That's one option,'' he said,
adding that the idea had not been presented as a formal
recommendation. ``And so I'm not going to say what I'm going to do
but that is one option.''
   _He is not considering dropping Dr. Louis W. Sullivan as his
candidate to head the department of Health and Human Services. Sen
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said some senators who have met with
Sullivan report that the nominee personally supports the Supreme
Court decision that legalized abortion _ a view different from that
of Bush, who says he wants the decision reversed.
   However, Bush said, ``He has supported my position 100 percent.''
   _He favors ``prudent development'' by oil companies in a vast
Arctic national wildlife refuge. Environmentalists are trying to
enlist Bush's support to keep the oil companies out, and say it the
issue will be a litmus test on how much Bush really wants to protect
the environment.

<HEAD>Takeshita Says He Will Not Resign Because of Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Wednesday he
won't be driven from office by a stock-trading scandal that has
forced three Cabinet ministers to resign, and will try to restore
public trust in government.
   Opposition leaders have demanded Takeshita's removal since Ken
Harada, the Economic Planning Agency director, resigned Tuesday
because of links to the Recruit Co. conglomerate, the company
involved.
   Harada was appointed a month ago in a Cabinet realignment
intended to quiet complaints about the scandal, and had been chosen
to lead an investigation of financial connections between Recruit
and politicians.
   Earlier this month, Takeshita declared his new Cabinet free of
taint from the scandal, in which politicians and others were offered
advance shares in a Recruit subsidiary and made huge profits when
the stock went public.
   Takeshita said in a television interview Wednesday the Harada
resignation ``reinforces my feeling that we need to do something. We
must make efforts to dispel public distrust in government and in the
party.''
   At a meeting with Japanese reporters, he said demands for his
resignation were ``a matter for me to judge.''
   News reports said Harada received monthly political donations of
about $80 from Recruit for 14 years until the end of 1987, well
after the stock-trading scandal was revealed.
   Recruit-Cosmos, the subsidiary, sold unlisted shares to more than
150 influential politicians, journalists and businessmen.
   Although the transactions were not illegal, the deal aroused
suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was a
public outcry over fund-raising practices and the traditional
coziness between Japanese businessmen and politicians.
   Harada, 69, was chosen for the new Cabinet the prime minister
appointed Dec. 27 in an attempt to restore the image of his
government and his party, the conservative Liberal Democrats.
   He said Tuesday, in resigning, that Recruit had not sought favors
from him and he had done nothing wrong. Koichiro Aino, also 69, was
appointed to replace him.
   Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa resigned after only three days
in office when it was disclosed that he continued receiving
donations from Recruit after the stock deal was exposed.
   Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister, quit in December after
repeatedly changing his story about an aide's purchase of shares in
his name.
   Takeshita told Japanese reporters Wednesday that opposition calls
for him to resign were ``a matter for me to judge.''
   The Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, adopted
a resolution at its annual convention Wednesday demanding
parliamentary elections.
   ``We're pretty sick of all this,'' Takako Doi, the party
chairwoman, said in a television interview.
   Several ranking current and former bureaucrats also have been
linked to Recruit.
   Kunio Takaishi, former deputy education minister, and Takashi
Kato, former deputy labor minister, bought shares in Recruit-Cosmos.
Takaishi was forced to abandon his quest for a seat in Parliament
and prosecutors have questioned Kato several times.
   Yoshiro Okai, the current deputy, and Masayuki Nomiyama, director
of the Labor Standards Bureau, acknowledged accepting dinners and
golf trips from Recruit. Labor Ministry officials both would quit at
the end of the month, but described the resignations as routine and
unrelated to the scandal.
   The ministry monitors and sets guidelines for the personnel and
employment-information fields, Recruit's main business, and
prosecutors are investigating the possibility of bribery.
   Since the scandal began last June, Takeshita has pledged to clean
up government, most recently saying in his New Year's speech he
would seek to revise election laws and rules for political donations.
   Asked Wednesday how he would erase public distrust, he said: ``I
will solve (problems) one by one.''
   The prime minister is scheduled to visit Washington next week to
meet with President Bush.

   A fire at a duplex home killed five
children this morning, authorities said.
   Two women escaped the flames by leaping from the second-story
window of the bedroom where the children's bodies were found, police
Officer Judy Jones said.
   The women, Valerie Parker, 24, and Samrlia Creek, 23, were listed
in stable condition at Anne Arundel General Hospital.
   The blaze was reported shortly after 3:15 a.m., said Fire Capt.
Norman Davis said.
   The children, who were not immediately identified, were all under
the age of 6, authorities said.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation.

<HEAD>Ex-President's Son Admits Leaving Threatening Message, Faces Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Reagan, son of the former president,
has admitted he left a profanity-laced, threatening message on the
answering machine of a photographer suing him over the publication
of two pictures.
   Photographer Roger Sandler has filed a complaint against Reagan
over the Jan. 15 phone call. Police Lt. Mike Farrell said he spoke
with Reagan, 43, on Tuesday and was preparing a report for the
district attorney's office, which would decide whether to prosecute.
   Sandler said a caller, identifying himself as Michael Reagan,
said, ``You can quote me,'' then launched into a tirade that
threatened physical harm against Sandler and ended with the words,
``I hope your ... family dies in a plane crash with you in it.''
   The call was made after the younger Reagan, the former
president's adopted son with ex-wife Jane Wyman, received a subpoena
from Sandler. In a small claims action, the photographer is seeking
$1,500 for copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in
Reagan's 1988 book, ``On The Outside Looking In.''
   The pictures were taken during the 1980 GOP convention in
Detroit. Sandler said Michael Reagan had copies of the pictures only
for his private use, but publication was not authorized. Sandler
didn't receive credit in the book for the pictures, either.
   Reagan said in a statement Tuesday, ``I regret that he was
uncredited,'' but contended that Sandler has been continually
raising his prices for the photos.
   ``I lost my cool, which I should not have done, and I apologize
for that,'' Reagan said. ``But I actually apologize more to my
friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by
the pressures placed on me because of my position.''
   Sandler said the apology won't make him drop the police complaint.
   ``He seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent
temper,'' said Sandler. ``I'm sorry he didn't handle the publication
of the pictures properly to begin with and didn't deal with me
honestly.''
   Under California law, it is a misdemeanor for a person to call
another individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or
threaten to inflict injury. The maximum punishment is a six-month
sentence and $1,000 fine.

<HEAD>What's in a Name? North Dakota By Any Other Name Would be as Cold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakota's reputation for blizzards,
howling winds and subzero cold may partly be blamed on its name,
according to a legislative resolution that seeks to change it to
simply ``Dakota.''
   ``I have come to see the word Dakota as having a much more
poetic, romantic connotation than the term North Dakota,'' said
state Sen. Tim Mathern, who introduced two resolutions in the
Legislature Wednesday calling for the change.
   State tourism director Jim Fuglie called the idea ``wonderful,''
but South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson said it would forsake a
century's worth of history.
   ``If either of us wants to change our name now, we might as well
call ourselves Michigan or Tallahassee, because any name change now
would deny 100 years or more of our heritage,'' Mickelson said.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner said he hadn't thought about the
issue, but ``I certainly don't have any built-in opposition.''
   One of Mathern's two resolutions calls on Congress to amend
federal enabling legislation to permit the name change. The 1889 act
admitted North and South Dakota, Montana and Washington to the
United States.
   The second resolution calls for a statewide election to make the
necessary amendment to the North Dakota Constitution.
   North Dakota ``conveys an image of severe climactic conditions,''
according to the first resolution, while Dakota ``conveys an image
reflective of the pioneering spirit of the inhabitants of the
state.''
   Dakota, which means ``friend'' in the Sioux language, was the
name for the territory that later became North and South Dakota, as
well as much of Wyoming and Montana.
   ``This is a serious look at the name of our state during our
centennial year,'' said Mathern, a Democrat. ``It gives us a chance
to look at what we feel good about, and want to take with us into
our second century.''
   The idea is not new. Bob Saueressig, a Bismarck advertising
executive, said in 1983 he and others paid for a billboard that
proclaimed: ``Let's drop `North' and call it `Dakota.'''
   The proposal generated national publicity, but the idea didn't
fly. Some wags suggested dropping ``Dakota'' instead, and the
proposal ``basically got laughed down,'' Saueressig said.
   Mathern, however, said his suggestion was serious.
   ``For those people who, at some point, need to have some levity
with this, I can understand that,'' he said. ``For me, it is not a
joke.''

<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislative committee has approved a bill
requiring children's homes to report certain information to the
state, a move sparked by widespread publicity on alleged abuse at a
fundamentalist Christian boarding home.
   The Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee approved the
measure Tuesday without substantive debate. Panel Chairman Robert
Huggins said he would likely call the bill up for debate before the
full Senate next week.
   ``It's the first time the Legislature has taken this bold a step
as far as regulation of these homes are concerned,'' he said. ``It's
been something that in the past has been so politically hot that no
one would touch it.''
   Sen. Jim Bean, chairman of the subcommittee that handled the
bill, said the proposal would not infringe on religious rights of
church-operated schools.
   The bill would require the homes to provide the state Department
of Health with:
   _ Names, guardians and nearest relatives of all residents.
   _ Proof of inspections by a local fire department or the state
fire marshal's office and the local health department.
   _ A statement that medical records are maintained on each child.
   The bill also would require the homes to file monthly reports
with the Department of Health and have on hand policies addressing
discipline and parent-child communication.
   Huggins said he would have preferred seeing the state Department
of Public Welfare as the agency receiving the reports rather than
the Department of Health.
   He said he believed political fallout from the Welfare
Department's raid on the Bethel Home for Children in Lucedale last
summer might have led to the Department of Health being the
designated agency.
   On June 10, the Welfare Department took temporary custody of 72
Bethel children based on allegations of abuse and neglect. Most of
the children taken from the home were released to parents or
guardians, but the state took custody of 17.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain, a fundamentalist Baptist minister and
founder of the controversial Bethel Home, has vowed to ignore any
legislation that becomes state law. He claims the home is part of
his church and is exempt from any kind of state regulation under the
U.S. Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Diplomats and lawmakers paid tribute Wednesday to
Bernt Carlsson, the United Nations commissioner for Namibia who was
killed aboard the Pan Am Boeing 747 that exploded over Scotland.
   Carlsson, 50, had been traveling to New York aboard Flight 103 to
attend the signing of an independence agreement for Namibia when the
jetliner was blown Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on
the ground.
   ``With his death, humanity has lost one of its great servants,''
opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock told a memorial meeting
at St. James' Church in central London.
   Kinnock, who knew Carlsson personally, said the Swedish diplomat
had used his skills to help the persecuted and deprived, and ``he
had so much more to do in the world that needed him to do more.''
   Also present were representatives of the Swedish Embassy and the
South West Africa People's Organization, which has fought a
guerrilla war to wrest Namibia from South African control.
   In a message read to the gathering, U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar called Carlsson a true internationalist.
   ``We mourn Bernt Carlsson's death, but in doing so, also express
our gratitude to him for the shining example he set,'' the message
said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless man who lived in a secluded part of a
hospital and was arrested in the murder of a physician there has
been indicted by a grand jury, the prosecutor said Wednesday.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Steven Smith beat,
raped, sodomized, strangled and robbed Dr. Kathryn Hinnant in her
fourth-floor office at Bellevue Hospital on Jan. 7.
   Her husband and a hospital administrator found her body the next
day, and Smith was arrested Jan. 9 after three homeless men said he
gave them items belonging to the doctor to sell.
   A $30,000 reward was offered in the case. Morgenthau said the
award money would be claimed, but declined to say by whom.
   Smith, 23, was charged with two counts of second-degree murder _
one accusing him of intentionally killing her, the other charging
that he caused her death while committing other felonies. The
maximum sentence in either case is 25 years to life. He was also
indicted on charges of first-degree robbery, rape and sodomy.
   Smith is being held without bail and will be arraigned in about
10 days, Morgenthau said. When arrested, Smith admitted being at the
murder scene but said another homeless man, whom he identified only
as John, killed Hinnant.
   ``We have nothing to corroborate his statement that anyone else
was involved,'' Morgenthau said.
   Smith lived in a maintenance and storage space on the 22nd floor
of the vast hospital at least since before Christmas, police said.
   Morgenthau said Smith stole the doctor's fur coat. He also
removed a ring, bracelets and a watch from her body, but did not
take them with him, the prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Despite Politics, Khomeini Still Conducts Marriage Ceremonies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini still finds
time to marry couples despite his political responsibilities, Iran's
official news agency said Wednesday.
   His daughter, Zahra Mustafavi, said Khomeini set aside time to
conduct marriages in ``certain cases.'' She did not elaborate.
   Mrs. Mustafavi, made the comments in an interview published
Wednesday in the English-language Tehran Times daily, amid
persistent reports that Khomeini was in poor health. Her comments
were carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency, which was
monitored in Nicosia.
   She said a main question her father asks the couples he marries
was ``whether they have read the terms and conditions in the
marriage documents.''
   The 88-year-old revolutionary leader has been ailing since a
heart attack two years ago and rarely leaves his heavily guarded
residence in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   Khomeini's 49-year-old daughter, who is married with two
children, said the last time she saw her father was Monday and he
was ``all right,'' IRNA reported.
   She said her father is very kind to all his children and never
interferes in their lives. ``He is more a listener than a speaker.''
   Mrs. Mustafavi is one of Khomeini's three daughters. He also has
two sons: Ahmed, 48, who is one of his closest advisors and Mustafa,
who died during Khomeini's exile in Iraq.

   Police on Wednesday ended the search
for victims of the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster, with 17 bodies still
missing out of the 270 people killed.
   Police also said a symbolic coffin would be lowered into a grave
next week at a service for those victims still missing and presumed
dead from the Dec. 21 bombing of the Boeing 747.
   Dumfries and Galloway Chief Constable John Boyd said the search,
which was carried out over 845 square miles of Scottish countryside,
would only be resumed in specific areas if it was thought necessary.
   ``The scale of the disaster has inevitably led to the conclusion
that some of the victims may never be recovered,'' he said.
   Inspector Mike Dean said police representatives last week visited
relatives of the 17 missing to tell them of the plans to call off
the search and hold the graveside service.
   He said seven were from the United States, three were from
Hungary, and seven were Lockerbie residents. Of the others killed,
253 bodies have been identified and returned to their families.
   He said most of the relatives of the missing victims planned to
come to the service Jan. 31, where a tombstone to remember all the
victims would be erected over the grave of the single coffin.
   The tombstone, donated by Pan Am, will read, ``In remembrance of
all victims of the Lockerbie disaster who died on Dec. 21, 1988.''

   Pope John Paul II greeted American businessmen George
Steinbrenner, Lee Iacocca and Bill Fugazy today at the end of a
general weekly audience that was disrupted by a young man who
shouted at the pontiff.
   The three businessmen were seated in the front row of the Paul VI
Auditorium, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole.
   The brief meeting was set up by the office of the New York
archbishop, Cardinal John O`Connor, said Frank Lattanzi, spokesman
for the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican. Steinbrenner is owner of the
New York Yankees, Iacocca is chairman of the the Chrysler Corp., and
Fugazy is a New York businessman.
   Lattanzi said the encounter lasted less than five minutes and
amounted to a handshake and introduction. He said Steinbrenner
brought some Yankee paraphernalia, such as warm-up jackets and
programs, and that the items were given to a Vatican official
afterward, not to the pope.
   Before they met, the pope's general weekly audience was briefly
interrupted when a young man stood up and began shouting at the
pope. Vatican guards took him out of the hall and the pope continued
with his address.
   The man abruptly stood up and yelled out in English, ``Speak
English,'' toward the end of the audience, when the pope reads
greetings in several languages following a religious speech in
Italian, a witness said.
   The man, whose nationality and name were not immediately known,
was being questioned by Vatican security.
   The pope stopped speaking at first when the man began shouting
but then resumed his speech and the audience applauded. However, the
pope was forced to pause during the commotion when the guards rushed
the man.

   A school bus rolled into a creek today,
killing the driver and critically injuring an 8-year-old, but a high
school sophomore helped lead 10 other students to safety through the
emergency door, authorities said.
   The Wellsville School District bus had run off a muddy dirt road
into Walnut Creek, investigators said.
   Investigators said the front end went into the water and 11
passengers escaped out the rear before the bus rolled the rest of
the way in, trapping driver Dale Thomasson, 46, of Wellsville, and
Loren Newkirk Jr. of rural Wellsville.
   The two apparently had tried to escape out the front, authorities
said.
   The boy was pulled out by rescue workers and listed in critical
condition at Ransom Memorial Hospital. He had been under water for
more than 30 minutes, but the cold may have kept him alive, a
sheriff's deputy said.
   Sheriff's depuies credited Bill Raley, a sophomore from rural
Wellsville, with leading younger children out of the bus.
   Thomasson was also an elementary school counselor and teacher.

   Vice President Dan Quayle vowed Wednesday the
Bush administration won't go ``duck hunting'' for ways to hike
taxes, even as other administration officials talked of ways to
raise new revenues.
   Quayle made a play on President Bush's ``no new taxes'' pledge
and Budget Director-designate Richard Darman's explanation of taxes
to Congress in which he said, ``If it looks like a duck, walks like
a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.''
   Quayle, in his first policy speech since becoming vice president
on Friday, said some people try to use the budget deficit as an
excuse to go ``duck hunting'' for new taxes for their ``pet spending
ideas.''
   ``Remember the code word as we go into this budget battle this
year _ no duck hunting, period,'' Quayle told a conference of the
Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation. ``No hunting ducks, No
hunting for taxes.''
   Quayle made the comments as Bush told reporters at the White
House that he would entertain an idea raised by Treasury Department
officials to tax depositors who put money in federally insured
institutions.
   Bush said he sees the idea as an option. But he deflected a
question on whether that would not be considered a tax by asking
whether an entrance fee to national parks is a tax.
   The proposed depositor fee would be 25 cents on every $100
deposited in federally insured institutions and the money would be
used to help the ailing savings and loan industry. Accounts in
commerical banks and credit unions also would be subject to such
fees.
   Quayle reiterated Bush's support for a presidential line-item
veto of the annual budget, instead of the current system of
accepting or rejecting the entire budget package.
   He said also that Congress should be held accountable through a
vote when a president asks it to rescind appropriations for
unnecessary spending that has already been approved. Currently the
money must be spent unless Congress acts on a president's recission
request within 45 days. Quayle said Congress should ``be forced to
act within 15 days after a rescission request is sent to Capitol
Hill.''
   Such reforms would give the president ``a greater voice in how
Congress spends the taxpayers' money.''
   ``Congress itself has a duty to its consitutents to work with the
administration to spend our money more prudently and responsibly
than it has in the past,'' he added.
   Quayle noted a Roper poll released Wednesday by the Citizens for
a Sound Economy had said most Americans believe the government
should hold down spending, not raise taxes, to cut the federal
budget deficit.
   The in-person interviews with 1,947 adults nationwide found that
62 percent believed increased spending caused the deficit while 9
percent said inadequate revenues were the cause and 21 percent put
the blame on a combination of spending and revenues.
   Quayle said the poll shows ``a broadly based distrust of the way
our government operates in taxing and spending.''
   The poll, conducted Dec. 3-10, also found 73 percent of those
polled said the government should hold down spending to cut the
deficit while 5 percent favored raising taxes and 12 percent wanted
both options used.
   The poll also asked people their opinions on whether Social
Security payments should have cost of living increases even if
government spending were held to present levels for two years.
   Sixty-four percent favored Social Security increases in a
spending-freeze situation while 26 percent were opposed.
   On new government programs, 43 percent of the respondents said
they oppose creation of new government programs until the deficit is
eliminated, while 40 percent favor new programs even with the
deficit.
   Citizens for a Sound Economy is a conservative organization
focusing on research and educational activities in economic issues.

<HEAD>Iraq Says War Could Resume</HEAD>

   A Cabinet minister said Wednesday ``any
spark'' on the 730-mile border with Iran could rekindle the war that
was suspended in August after eight years and an estimated one
million deaths.
   Latif Nussayif Jasim, Iraq's information minister, said in an
interview the factionalized Iranian leadership does not seem capable
of negotiating peace and talks will remain deadlocked until that
changes.
   Special U.N. envoy Jan Eliason met with Iranian leaders Wednesday
in Tehran in an attempt to revive the negotiations, which began in
Geneva on Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-supervised cease-fire took
effect.
   Eliasson is expected in Baghdad on Friday, perhaps with proposals
from Iran.
   Each side accuses the other of frustrating the negotiations.
Iranian television said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told
Eliasson ``It is not acceptable that ... our territories are still
occupied due to Iraqi subterfuges and delaying tactics.''
   Iran claims Iraqi soldiers still occupy 260 square miles of its
territory. Iraq says Iran is stalling for time to rebuild its
military forces, which suffered several defeats last year and forced
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime to accept a truce. The Iraqis
accuse Iran of massing troops on the border.
   U.N. military observers say the cease-fire is holding, despite
claims by both sides of violations.
   Neither side has withdrawn from the truce line as stipulated by
the terms, and Iranian officials have said they see no point in
resuming the Geneva talks unless the United Nations can guarantee
progress.
   Jasim said: ``We believe Iran does not have the ability to make a
decision regarding peace. That's why they want to maintain the
no-war, no-peace situation.''
   His apparent reference was to divisions in the Iranian hierarchy
after Khomeini's decision last July 18 to accept a U.N. Security
Council cease-fire resolution,
   Without a stable cease-fire ``any spark could lead once again to
an unsolvable problem,'' the information minister said.
   He denied Western news reports that Iraq was willing to make
concessions on the Shatt-al-Arab, which is Iraq's only sea outlet
and was the prewar southern boundary between the Persian Gulf
neighbors.
   ``The Shatt-al-Arab is an Iraqi waterway,'' Jasim declared.
   The dispute over who controls the Shatt, formed by the confluence
of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, helped start the war in
September 1980.
   Iraq invaded Iran after weeks of border skirmishes. A few days
before the invasion, President Saddam Hussein abrogated a 1975
treaty drawing the boundary down the middle of the waterway.
   Before that treaty, the border had run along the eastern, Iranian
bank, putting the waterway in Iraq. Control of the Shatt is at the
center of the impasse in Geneva.
   Jasim said Iran must allow Iraq free navigation through the
Persian Gulf and its southern outlet, the Strait of Hormuz. Iraq
also wants the Shatt cleared of sunken ships and other debris under
U.N. supervision and negotiations on its status postponed until the
job is done.
   Iran would have full rights to use the waterway after a
settlement, Jasim said. He added that Iraq ``has no ambition for
Iranian territory'' and is eager to conclude a peace treaty.

<TEXT>
   An unusually large jury was selected
Wednesday to hear evidence against a man accused of terrorizing
Blackstone Valley residents with a series of sniper attacks two
winters ago.
   Selection of the 16-member jury was completed after a last-minute
appeal for more potential jurors. The original group of 25 jury
canidates was exhausted because many would-be jurors were familiar
with the sniper attacks, which received wide publicity.
   Juries normally contain 14 members, including two alternates, but
two additional alternates were selected because the trial of Peter
T. Trepanier is expected to take four to six weeks, said prosecutor
Eva-Marie Mancuso.
   Trepanier, 25, of Burrillville, is accused along with a high
school classmate of 35 counts, including multiple charges of assault
with intent to commit murder, arson, burglary, and conspiracy. The
arson charges carry a potential sentence of life in prison.
   The classmate, Russell J. Ducharme II, is scheduled to go on
trial after Trepanier's case is finished.
   The charges stem in part from eight of 11 nighttime sniper
attacks in December 1986 and January 1987 that forced Cumberland and
North Smithfield residents to huddle behind drawn curtains. The
attacks prompted Gov. Edward D. DiPrete to call out the National
Guard, which patrolled for about six weeks.
   Superior Judge Dominic F. Cresto said after the jurors were sworn
in Thursday they would tour the rural area where the sniper attacks
occurred. Opening arguments were tentatively scheduled for Friday.
   Two of the attacks occurred in Bellingham, Mass., where Trepanier
and Ducharme also face charges of assault with intent to commit
murder. Massachusetts authorities were waiting for the Rhode Island
trials to conclude before pressing those charges, said Catherine
Ferrone, a Bellingham police secretary.
   The men were arrested when Trepanier walked into the Woonsocket
police station on Oct. 8, 1987, and allegedly confessed to the
snipings and implicated Ducharme.

   An alleged gang-rape victim forced under
threat of jail to testify at trial was taken from the courthouse on
a stretcher this morning as she was about to take the stand for a
second day.
   It could not immediately be determined what was wrong with the
woman or where the ambulance took her.
   The woman ``has fallen ill, so we're going to take other
witnesses out of order'' until she returns, Judge Gilberto Hinojosa
told the jury.
   The woman had testified Tuesday until mid-afternoon, when she
reported fainting during a break in her cross-examination. Earlier
in the day, a defense attorney had suggested in opening arguments
that she was sex-crazed.
   Felipe Chew, 29, is on trial on an aggravated kidnapping charge
and also faces a sexual assault trial in the case. He was indicted
with nine other men after the woman reported being abducted and
raped by as many as 20 men in March.
   Her testimony in the case's first trial in September led to the
sexual assault conviction of a 24-year-old man, who was sentenced to
20 years in prison.
   The woman asked to be excused from testifying in the Chew trial,
and the prosecutor agreed to the request, but the judge on Tuesday
compelled her to testify or go to jail for contempt of court.
   She said that publicity from the case disrupted her personal life
and that the news media had harassed her.
   ``To a certain extent, I sympathize with what you've been going
through, or what you say you've been going through,'' said the
judge. ``But too much has happened for me to allow you to determine
whether or not this case should proceed.''
   Prosecution testimony continued this morning with investigator
Jerry Galvan describing the woman as ``withdrawn, almost in shock''
the morning after the incident.
   Defense attorney Jaime Garza in his opening statement Tuesday
said the trial would include testimony about ``women who have an
insatiable desire for sex, women that just can't get enough, even
with multiple men.''
   He said a witness would testify the woman got willingly into a
car with the men she said abducted her.
   Garza also noted the woman's request to be excused from
testifying, saying, ``You have to ask yourselves, `Why? Why didn't
she want to testify?'''
   During her testimony Tuesday, the woman said she was pulled into
a car with Chew and three other men, taken to a ranch where an
illegal cockfight was being held and forced to perform sex acts with
a number of men, including Chew.

<HEAD>Berkeley May Put Safe-Sex Kits Beside Hotel Bibles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials hoping to stem the spread
of AIDS are considering a proposal that would require innkeepers to
put safe sex kits beside the good book in each hotel room.
   ``Certainly if hotels can have a Gideon Bible in every room, they
can include a safe sex kit,'' said nurse practitioner Leland
Traiman, a clinical AIDS researcher who proposed the idea.
   ``There could be a sign with each kit saying, `The Bible may save
your soul, but this will save your life,''' said Traiman, who served
on the city's AIDS health commission last year.
   The proposal was on Wednesday's agenda for the City Council's
Committee on Public Safety and Health and is also scheduled for a
hearing before the city's Community Health Advisory Committee next
month.
   City Councilwoman Ann Chandler, who chairs the council committee,
said she is not sure safe-sex kits should be required by law. But
she added, ``Given the crisis caused by AIDS, we must do all we can
to educate the community. It's an issue that needs to be discussed.''
   Each kit would contain condoms and information about how AIDS is
transmitted.
   David Morris, chairman of the Community Health Advisory
Committee, said he knows very little about the proposal but that it
``didn't seem like a half-bad idea.''
   Not surprisingly, some hoteliers disagree.
   ``My boss is hitting the ceiling!'' said Doris Flood, manager of
Traveler's Lodge, a few blocks from the University of California.
   ``He's called the home office, and the home office has called
England, and I'm not even going to tell you what England said,''
said Flood, whose hotel is owned by the British-based Trustforte Inc.
   ``We are three blocks from the university. A lot of our clientele
is associated with the university. They are mostly older people or
professors or people from Europe; it's not conducive to our
clientele here,'' Flood said.
   She also worried that a faulty condom could leave the hotel
vulnerable to a lawsuit.
   Steve Rodri, general manager of the Berkeley Marina Marriott
Hotel, said his Mormon-run franchise places the Book of Mormon in
each room and doesn't even allow Playboy Magazine in the gift shop.
He said the hotel is not about to place condoms in the rooms.
   ``The Marriott organization has always stood for high morals and
professional ethics,'' Rodri said. ``I think it could be difficult
to ask a housekeeper of deep religious convictions to handle these
types of items.''
   Traiman said the idea was born last year when the city's Health
Commission tried to persuade hot tub and sauna owners to post AIDS
warnings and to provide safe sex information. The managers of one
sauna refused.
   ``They told us they wouldn't cooperate until there are safe sex
kits in all hotel and motel rooms in Berkeley,'' he said.
```Voila!,' we said. We all thought it was such a good idea that we
decided to pursue it.''

   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
said shortly before he was slain on a hijacked TWA jetliner that he
was ready to die to save the lives of other passengers, a witness
testified Wednesday.
   Australian Ruth Henderson told a Frankfurt court how she tried to
comfort Stethem after he had been badly beaten by the hijackers of
Flight 847 in June 1985.
   Stethem was later shot to death and his body thrown onto the
runway at Beirut airport.
   Ms. Henderson, 20, was testifying at the trial of Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with air piracy and murder
in the hijacking of the Athens-to-Rome flight.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies
shooting Stethem.
   Ms. Henderson said she sat next to Stethem on the plane for
several hours after Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., had been beaten.
   The witness, her voice often shaking, said she tried to lift
Stethem's spirits by talking about everyday things.
   ``He was quite badly injured and he was crying,'' she told the
court. ``His injuries included a bleeding head and back. His wrists
had been tied very tightly and he had no feeling in his hands. His
knees and ribs were very sore.''
   She said Stethem told her he ad been kicked in the ribs and knees.
   ``We talked about unimportant things, about his diving, about
Greece. By talking about normal things, he seemed to relax and
forget the pain. It helped keep both our minds off the ordeal,'' Ms.
Henderson said.
   ``He was unable to light or hold a cigarette and I had to do it
for him,'' she continued. ``He said that if he lived, he thought his
life would never be the same again.''
   ``He said how it may be better that he died. He believed that
someone would die on the plane, someone from the Navy men, and he
said that because he was the only one who wasn't married, that he
should be the one to die. He spoke with a clear mind,'' Ms.
Henderson testified.
   There were six U.S. Navy divers on the plane. Thirty-nine
Americans were held hostage 17 days during the ordeal.
   ``He didn't believe that all of us could get out alive. He felt
it was fair that he dies so that the rest of us could live,'' the
witness said.
   Ms. Henderson said she did not know whether Hamadi or his
accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, shot Stethem. The accomplice remains
at large.
   Hamadi listened attentively, his hair close-cropped after series
of neurological examinations. He was arrested in January 1987 at
Frankfurt's airport after officials there discovered explosives in
his luggage.
   The trial began in July in the heavily guarded courtroom inside
Preungesheim prison.

   President Bush voiced firm support today for
Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan, saying
Sullivan fully supports Bush's opposition to abortion.
   In an interview with a small group of reporters in the Oval
Office, Bush replied, ``none,'' when asked whether he foresaw any
circumstances in which he would withdraw Sullivan's nomination.
   Bush took issue with reports that Sullivan disagrees with the
president's position advocating a reversal by the Supreme Court of
its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``He has supported my position 100 percent,'' the president said.
``I've not heard anyone suggesting that he will not be confirmed. I
haven't heard one single person suggest that.''
   Meanwhile, Sullivan met with a group of Republican senators in
the office of Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and said, ``I found
them to be very supportive.''
   Sullivan was asked by reporters if he favored overturning Roe vs.
Wade. He responded only by saying, ``Once the hearings go forward
everything will be cleared.''
   ``He sort of gave us a preview of it and if he says what he said
... his preview was satisfactory,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said of Sullivan, ``He was never in
favor of retaining Roe vs. Wade.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.M., an opponent of abortion, said that
on the basis of his questioning of Sullivan at the meeting he is
convinced ``Sullivan believes in his heart that the Roe vs. Wade
decision should be overturned.''
   Earlier, Humphrey had said he was concerned that some senators
who met with Sullivan in advance of his confirmation hearing next
week reported the nominee personally supported the Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.
   Asked after the meeting with Sullivan if he had any reservations
about the secretary-designate, Humphrey said, ``Not in my mind on
the basis of this meeting.''
   On Tuesday, Humphrey said he saw little likelihood the Sullivan
nomination would be blocked.
   ``Let's put it plainly: Dr. Sullivan is the only black nominee to
the Cabinet. It would be an embarrassment to the president, an
embarrassment to the Republican Party, if the nomination encountered
any trouble and we don't want that,'' Humphrey said then.
   ``We want to make the best of the situation and that's what we've
been striving to do by encouraging the White House to surround
Sullivan with people experienced in government and who would
actively support the president on abortion,'' he said.
   Bush, in a bid to placate anti-abortion groups, will name
Constance Horner as undersecretary of HHS, an administration source,
declining to be named publicly, said today. Horner, director of the
Office of Personnel Management under President Reagan, is considered
acceptable by anti-abortion lawmakers.
   The Horner appointment was initally reported by The Washington
Post, The New York Times and The Washington Times.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said that in his meeting with
Sullivan, ``he said that personally he would favor abortions in
three instances, the life of the mother, rape or incest. But he says
that he's going to go with President Bush's policies, and I think
that's responsible.''
   Bush also has said he favors abortion in those same circumstances.
   In addition, Sullivan has said he opposes federal spending on
abortions except for those three exceptions, a position Bush also
has supported.
   According to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore. and ranking Republican on
the Senate Finance Committee, which has scheduled a Feb. 1
confirmation hearing for Sullivan, the doctor was mystified by all
the interest in the abortion issue.
   ``I think he was stunned and not prepared for the fervor over
something that he regarded as a relatively slight part of what would
be his responsibilities, and he has the proportion right _ it is a
slight part,'' said Packwood, who supports women's right to make
their own decisions on abortion.
   HHS, with a nearly $400 billion budget this year, encompasses the
Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security programs as well as the
Public Health Service and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Packwood said he was impressed with Sullivan, the founder of the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, and hoped he would not be
hamstrung by anti-abortion concerns in his personnel appointments.
   ``I would hope that in picking someone who's going to head the
Health Care Financing Administration, that he'd pick somebody that
has some knowledge about how we can contain health costs, not are
they pro-choice or anti-choice on abortion,'' Packwood said.

   President Bush said Wednesday he hopes the
Federal Reserve Board's concern about inflation won't lead the
central bank to stifle economic growth by driving up interest rates.
   Bush said he believes the economy is ``reasonably stable,'' and
he added, ``There's no signals out there in the markets that this
economy is in real trouble.''
   The president's comments, in an Oval Office interview with two
newspaper reporters, came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan told a House committee that the central bank is
likely to keep a tight grip on the money supply to control inflation.
   Bush said he had not read Greenspan's comments and preferred not
``to get into commenting on'' such testimony.
   He did say, ``I haven't talked to Alan lately, but I don't want
to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we
impede growth. We have to keep expanding opportunities for the
working men and women of this country.''
   Also Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's district banks reported
stronger economic activity in December and early January, fueled by
strength in retail sales and manfacturing.
   The report, based on surveys conducted by the 12 district banks,
found little change in other sectors of the economy. Demand for bank
loans was generally flat; construction work was subdued in most
parts of the country, and continuing dry weather threatened the
winter wheat crop in some areas.
   ``It would appear, on the basis of these reports, that the
national economy gained momentum in recent weeks as consumer
spending strengthened, manufacturing activity continued to rise and
producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment,'' said
the report.
   The survey was prepared for the Feb. 7-8 meeting of the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Commitee, the panel that sets monetary policy
for the central bank. The Federal Reserve has appeared to be pushing
up interest rates since March to dampen inflation pressures and
contain economic growth.
   Greenspan, in his comments Tuesday, said that strains on
factories' production capacity and a tight labor market could be
expected to keep inflation pressures high and that the nation would
``risk a serious intensification of inflationary pressures at some
not-too-distant point.''
   Given the long-run costs of inflation, he said, the Federal
Reserve ``might well be advised to err more on the side of
restrictiveness than of stimulus.''
   The Federal Reserve's survey of economic conditions found
unexpectedly high retail sales throughout the country, including
strong sales of new cars and trucks.
   In manufacturing, production was at or above November levels.
Several industries were using most of their production capacity, but
only a few, such as chemicals, reported that limits on capacity had
constrained production.
   As use of capacity rises, economists fear factories will have
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages
and price increases.
   In an indication of future activity, manufacturers reported plans
to increase capital spending in the coming year, mostly for new
equipment rather than to expand plants.
   While the survey found economic activity overall to be strong,
the Philadelphia district reported ``indications that the pace of
the advance may be slackening.''
   The district reported that manufacturers expect to ease activity
during the first half of the year and that retailers were generally
cautious about sales and are keeping inventories under tight control.

   The government expelled two Soviet

   Both news agencies have been operating for a decade in Sierra
Leone, which has had cordial relations with the Soviet Union.
   The two governments recently signed a new fishing agreement
permitting Soviet vessels to operate off the Sierra Leone coast, and
more than 800 Sierra Leonean students were studying in Soviet
colleges and universities.

   Former professional basketball player
Michael Donnell Niles faces the death penalty for killing his wife
to collect on her $100,000 insurance policy.
   Niles was convicted Tuesday in the Dec. 13, 1984, death of Sonja
Rose Niles, who was hit by a shotgun blast to the head at close
range. He is to be sentenced next week.
   Niles, 33, was drafted and waived by the Philadelphia 76ers in
1979. But he signed with the National Basketball Association's
Phoenix Suns as a free agent in 1980 and remained with the club
until he was waived a year later.
   The Riverside County Superior Court jury found that Niles
conspired with Noel Jackson of Los Angeles to murder his wife. On
Monday, a separate jury convicted Jackson of murder.
   Prosecutors said Niles, who lives in Corona, arranged to pay
Jackson $5,000 to kill Mrs. Niles _ after collecting $100,000 from a
life insurance policy. Both men accused the other of the murder.
   A witness testified that Niles said he wanted his wife killed
because she ``messed me out'' of money from basketball.

   An offshore oil rig sank
Wednesday in stormy gulf waters off Abu Dhabi, but no injuries were
reported, shipping sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the rig
was the JAKS 1, but they had no further details on its size or
capacity.
   The rig collapsed slowly, allowing for the workers to evacuate,
the sources said.
   The Abu Al-Bakoosh oil field is owned by the emirate of Abu Dhabi
and is operated by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. in conjunction
with the French oil company Total.
   It has a production capacity of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels per day.
It is about 120 miles north of Abu Dhabi.
   The field was the target of an air raid in a spillover of the
Iraq-Iran war into the Persian Gulf in November 1986. At least eight
foreign workers were killed.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a plane that crashed last
April, killing the Montana secretary of state, may not have been
medically qualified to fly and may have suffered a heart attack just
before the crash, federal authorities say.
   Crashes like the one that killed Jim Waltermire have resulted in
a recommendation that the Federal Aviation Administration tighten
regulation of the medical condition of pilots, an investigator said.
   Waltermire, 39, and the 64-year-old pilot, James Andrew Morris,
died April 8 when the twin-engine plane they were flying crashed in
a snowstorm.
   At the time, Waltermire was the leading candidate for the
Republican gubernatorial nomination. He was returning to Helena
after a campaign appearance.
   The National Transportation Safety Board report did not decide
the cause of the crash, saying the airplane was destroyed and there
was little evidence on what happened before the crash.
   However, NTSB investigator Verlin Tranter said Morris' medical
history suggests that he ``may have suffered an acute incapacitating
event'' such as a heart attack or stroke under the stress of the
difficult landing.
   H.C. Burton, the FAA flight surgeon in Salt Lake City who
reviewed Morris' file after the crash, said Tuesday that Morris had
heart problems and high blood pressure that required drugs to
control.
   Authorities at the FAA's Aeromedical Certification Branch in
Oklahoma City, concerned about Morris' heart problems, had written
to the pilot only three days before the crash asking for more
medical information, Burton said.
   Had that review been begun earier, officials said, the veteran
pilot may have been found medically unfit to continue flying. But
they stressed that at the time of the crash, Morris' permission to
fly had not been revoked and he had done nothing illegal.
   ``I don't think Mr. Morris was trying to violate anything,''
Tranter said Wednesday. ``But he was getting up there in years.''
   Tranter said Morris had a valid certificate for a commercial
pilot.
   But in a telephone interview Wednesday, Tranter said Morris may
have held the certificate only because lax supervision of medical
records at the FAA branch.
   He said that when a medical certificate is issued after a quick
examination, the examination report is sent to the FAA center for
more detailed evaluation. The FAA center can ask for more
information if it doubts a pilot's fitness to fly _ as it did in
Morris' case. During that evaluation, the certificate remains valid.
   Tranter and Burton said Morris had a history of ``ischemic
events'' _ similar to minor heart attacks _ and an electrocardiogram
suggested possible heart muscle damage. But Morris showed no
symptoms of heart disease and denied experiencing chest pain.
   ``Nevertheless,'' Burton said, ``the conditions were in place to
explain an acute cardiovascular event. The severe stress he was
encountering in landing that plane could have been the precipitating
factor.''
   Tranter said that as a result of the Waltermire crash and similar
incidents, the NTSB has recommended the FAA change its procedures,
possibly by revoking a medical certificate immediately if the
evaluation center has doubts about a pilot's medical fitness.

<HEAD>Warheads Reportedly Removed from Five MX Missiles after Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force removed the warheads from five of
its 50 MX nuclear missiles late last year after a summertime
accident in which one missile came loose and fell to the bottom of
its underground silo, according to a published report.
   The five missiles were part of the same production lot and Air
Force investigators discovered a common problem that forced the
safety action, the Washington Post said.
   The service is still trying to decide how to repair the five
missiles, each of which is designed to carry 10 warheads, the paper
added, quoting unidentified sources.
   The Air Force refused to confirm the account on Wednesday,
acknowledging only that a single MX missile had been taken off alert
last June following an accident.
   That accident previously had been reported by newspapers in
Wyoming, where F.E. Warren Air Force Base is located. The nation's
MX, or Peacekeeper, missiles are all deployed at F.E. Warren.
   The Air Force also insisted Wednesday, without elaborating, that
the nation's entire MX force of 50 missiles was on alert ``at this
time.''
   ``We have 50 missiles that are deployed and operational at this
time,'' said Lt. Col. Don Christianson, a spokesman at F.E. Warren.
   Christianson refused to say whether any problem missiles had been
replaced with new missiles in order to maintain the alert force.
   The spokesman agreed, however, that one MX missile had been taken
off alert, its warheads removed and its components broken down as
part of a safety investigation after an incident last June.
   ``Last summer, we received indications of an electrical
disconnection with a Peacekeeper (MX) missile inside its silo,''
Christianson said.
   ``An investigation was conducted, and a structural failure in a
support skirt was found to be the cause. There was no safety threat.
The reports of the investigation are classified, however, so I can't
go further.''
   The Post said Wednesday the missile had fallen between six inches
and a foot when it came ``unglued'' from its underground launch
canister. The canister envelops the missile and is used to propel
the four-stage MX from its silo before the main rocket motor is
ignited.
   The newspaper said the fall of the 195,000-pound missile was
sufficient to cause ``grave damage'' and to require ``extensive
repairs.'' And when the Air Force further investigated the matter,
it concluded the missile was one of a batch of five that had been
subject to a particular production problem, the paper said.
   Air Force officials responded by ordering removal of the
10-warhead packages atop each of the other four suspect missiles to
relieve the weight and pressure on their canister bonds pending
corrective action, the paper concluded.
   The Air Force so far has been authorized to build 50 of the
missiles and to deploy them at F.E. Warren.
   Former President Ronald Reagan pushed Congress for permission to
build 50 more MX missiles and to base them on mobile rail-car
launchers. The administration of President Bush has yet to make a
final decision on whether to push that same program or endorse
another program to develop a truck-mounted, single-warhead Midgetman
nuclear missile.

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday created an
Office of Labor of the Holy See that a union representing Vatican
City law workers had been requesting for 10 years.
   The office, described as a ministry of labor for the Vatican,
will open March 1. It is designed to help negotiate solutions to
labor problems between the Holy See and its lay workers, including
those in the curia, or the administration of the Vatican, and
Vatican Radio.
   John Paul, in creating the office, said it must operate according
to a spirit of true justice and always seek conciliation in times of
controversey.
   The pontiff announced his intentions to institute such an office
in a document he issued last year on reforms in the curia.
   Mariano Cerullo, the president of the Association of Vatican Lay
Workers, called the creation of the office a positive development.
   In February 1988, the union staged an unusual labor protest
against a change in the Vatican pay schedule and to press its
demands for the creation of such an office. In the protest, the
workers performed their jobs but pledged to donate their first three
hours pay to the pope to help feed the poor.
   Archbishop Jan Schootte, a Belgian who handles Vatican labor
relations, said at the time that the protest was unjustified and
that negotiations were in progress toward creating the office.

   Officials of the Byelorussian republic plan to
build a monument to the estimated 30,000 victims of political
executions carried out in a forest during Josef Stalin's rule, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The government daily Izvestia quoted Nina Mazai, a deputy premier
of Byelorussia, as saying that 510 mass graves have been found in
the Kuropaty area near the republic's capital of Minsk.
   Ms. Mazai, who chairs a commission investigating the killings,
said six graves, each containing the remains of 50-60 people, have
been excavated.
   Workers have found cartridge cases, bullets and clothes, and
these objects have been analyzed using a laser, she told Izvestia.
   Ms. Mazai said at least 30,000 people were buried at Kuropaty,
down from previous estimates that more than 100,000 had been killed
there. The exact figure cannot be determined, she said.
   The mass executions were carried out by the secret police, which
at the time was called the NKVD, from 1937 to 1941, and the
commission is trying to determine the motive for the slayings and
the identities of the victims, the official said.
   A competition for design of a monument to the victims is being
organized by the Byelorussian Culture Ministry, the State
Construction Committee, Minsk city government and the unions of
architects and artists.
   In October, the weekly newspaper Moscow News reported that men
and women branded ``enemies of the people'' under Stalin were
brought alongside newly dug ditches at Kuropaty and made to stand in
rows. They were then gagged and shot, the newspaper said.
   The article said Soviet authorities tried to cover up what had
happened at Kuropaty.
   Under Stalin, millions of innocent Soviets lost their lives or
were imprisoned in a campaign of terror. Revalations of Stalin's
crimes have flooded the Soviet press since Mikhail S. Gorbachev took
power and instituted his campaign for openness four years ago.

   President Bush today named an eight-member
panel to recommend ethical standards for government officials,
saying he wants an unambigious code of conduct to avoid even the
appearance of conflict of interest.
   Bush this week is making ethics a continuing theme, to ensure
that he does not face the allegations of an administration ``sleaze
factor'' that dogged his predecessor.
   ``We need an unambiguous code, a code of conduct, to ensure that
those who serve the public trust avoid any actual or apparent
conflict between their personal and public interest,'' he said in
setting up the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform by executive
order.
   Bush said current ethics rules ``do not adequately serve to
eliminate use of public funds for private gains.'' He said the laws
are fragmented and confusing.
   Bush ordered his new commission to give him recommendations for
new legislation by March 9.
   The panel's chairmen are Griffin Bell, the former attorney
general in the Carter administration, and Malcolm Wilkey, a senior
judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   Other panel members are former White House counsels Fred Fielding
and Lloyd Cutler, Washington attorney Jan Baran, former Rep.
Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico, former counsel to the Senate Armed
Services Committee R. James Woolsey, and Judith Bello, former
counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
   On Tuesday, Bush asked the director of the Office of Government
Ethics, Frank Nebeker, to brief all senior administration officials
on ethical and conflict-of-interest standards required of them, said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush had proposed during his campaign that such briefings be held
on an annual basis, and Nebeker wrote to him on the day after the
Nov. 8 election offering to conduct the sessions, said Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the 10-minute meeting with Nebeker on Tuesday was
for ``symbolic value'' to emphasize the importance Bush attaches to
ethical conduct.
   More than 100 members of the Reagan administration, in which Bush
served as vice president, were at various times accused of unethical
or improper behavior. Two of President Reagan's closest advisers,
Lynn Nofziger and Michael Deaver, were convicted of offenses
associated with their lobbying after they left the administration,
while a string of allegations against Reagan's longtime friend and
attorney general, Edwin Meese III, battered the Justice Department.
   An independent prosecutor declined to seek indictment of Meese,
but the Justice Department's own ethics office concluded this month
that he had engaged in conduct ``that should not be tolerated of any
government employee.''
   Democrats assailed the ``sleaze factor'' and used it as
ammunition in the fall campaigns. Bush responded by saying
repeatedly that he intended to have an administration that hews to
high ethical standards.
   Bush supported President Reagan's veto of ethics legislation
passed by Congress last year, but said he wants to introduce his own
package. It is expected to contain the same standards, where
applicable, for Congress as it sets for the executive branch
employees. Last year's package set differing standards.
   The new commission will take testimony on simplification or
expansion of current ethics rules, and will make recommendations to
Bush for legislation on the issue.
   Bush has put his White House legal counsel Boyden Gray in charge
of coordinating ethics policy.
   On Thursday the president will continue to spotlight the issue by
meeting with senior executive employees to ``emphasize the ethics
provisions of the law and their responsibilities and what he expects
of them,'' said Fitzwater.
   On Friday, he will talk to the inspectors general of the
government departments to emphasize their role in ethics enforcement.

   A sheriff brought 69 prisoners from his jail to
the state Capitol on Wednesday to dramatize the jail overcrowding he
and other sheriffs say the Legislature must remedy.
   DeKalb County Sheriff Pat Jarvis said he sent the prisoners back
to Decatur after he was threatened with arrest for criminal
trespassing. The prisoners never left the two jail buses, and Jarvis
said he never intended to take them into the Capitol, where groups
of schoolchildren toured.
   It was a part of a protest by sheriffs and their representatives
from across Georgia who are forced to house more than 4,100 state
prisoners because state prisons have no room.
   State prisons currently house about 18,700 prisoners, 43 percent
more than they were designed to hold.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris ordered the buses away, calling the display
``totally irresponsible.'' Jarvis denied the charge, saying he had
informed Capitol security guards and Atlanta police they were coming.
   ``This is not a sideshow, this is business,'' Jarvis said of the
protest. He described the prisoners as non-violent.
   Jarvis said the demonstration was to support Senate Bill 149,
which would let counties decide whether they want to accept overflow
state prisoners for long periods.
   Jarvis, who said his jail leads the state with 250 overflow state
prisoners, was asked where the state should put them if it can't
require counties to house them.
   ``That's not my problem. Where am I going to put them?'' he said.
   Under current law, counties can be forced to accept the inmates.
They are paid $15 a day per prisoner, which Jarvis said is about
half the actual cost.
   Hall County Sheriff Dick Mecum, whose jail had a costly uprising
blamed on overcrowding during the Christmas holidays, said
legislative priorities are skewed.
   ``If Atlanta wants to build a stadium let them build a domed
stadium. But let them pay for it; leave us out of it,'' he said at a
news conference inside the Capitol. He was referring to legislation
that would pay for a domed stadium with hotel-motel tax revenues.
   The $7 billion-plus budget proposed by Harris for fiscal 1990
includes no money for more prisons, even though Corrections
Commissioner David Evans has asked for 7,100 new prison beds, said
John Jeffries of Clarke County, vice president of the Association
County Commissioners of Georgia.
   Many county jails have more state overflow inmates alone than
they have beds, said Sheriff Greg Coursey of Burke County, president
of the Georgia Sheriffs Association. He said his jail, with 22 beds,
has 44 inmates he was forced to accept from the state.
   He said sheriffs are being hit with lawsuits spurred by
overcrowding, poor hygiene and riots.
   Just this week, overcrowded jails in Colquitt and Turner counties
reported minor uprisings, and overcrowding was a factor in recent
disturbances at prisons in Milledgeville and Hall County.
   ``These things are going to continue to pop up as long as we've
got too many prisoners,'' Jarvis said.

   Passengers miffed that a train skipped
their stop delayed the train for 19 minutes in protest, sparking a
counter-rebellion by riders who wanted the train to proceed,
authorities said Wednesday.
   ``Human oversight and human error'' were the reasons why the 7
p.m. Metro-North Commuter Railroad train from Grand Central breezed
by the Fleetwood station Tuesday night, said Metro-North spokesman
Daniel Brucker.
   The train, due to stop in Fleetwood, at 7:26 p.m., skipped the
stop to the consternation of the 50 to 60 passengers who wanted to
get off there and pulled in three minutes later at Bronxville, said
Brucker. Angry commuters delayed the train for 19 minutes by holding
the doors open as they demanded explanations from the engineer and
train crew.
   Some passengers insisted the train back up the three-quarters of
a mile to the bypassed station, but Brucker said to do so would have
violated federal regulations.
   Witnesses said a counter-rebellion broke out when commuters
headed for stations up the line tried to remove the Fleetwood
passengers from the doorways. About 1,500 passengers were on the
train, Brucker said.
   Brucker said dispatchers ordered a southbound express train to
stop at the Bronxville station and pick up the Fleetwood passengers
at 8:10 p.m..
   The railroad may consider disciplinary charges against the
engineer, who was not identified, the spokesman said.

Britain's wartime prime minister, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday.
   Other recipients of the award have included British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Averell Harriman, the former U.S.

   The foundation was set up in 1954 by American friends and
admirers of Churchill to enable Americans to study and carry out
research at Churchill College in Cambridge University.
   The award will be presented in Los Angeles on May 17.
   The 67-year-old prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, will stop

   John Cleese won libel damages Wednesday from a
newspaper that claimed he had increasingly come to resemble Basil
Fawlty, the manic hotel owner he played in the hit television series
``Fawlty Towers.''
   His lawyer, Roderick Dadak, said Cleese did not tweak people's
ears or routinely fly into manic or irrational rages and ``the claim
that in real life he resembles Basil Fawlty is absurd.''
   In an out-of-court settlement approved Wednesday by the High
Court, Cleese, 49, accepted undisclosed ``substantial'' damages, to
be donated to a charity of his choice, from publisher Robert
Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers. The newspaper group also agreed
to pay Cleese's legal costs and publish an apology.
   The newspaper group's lawyer, Simon Gallant, said the article
should not have been published and apologized for embarrassing and
distressing Cleese.
   The Daily Mirror reported in August 1987 that Cleese, a founding
member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, had got into the habit of
painfully tweaking the ears of fellow cast members and flew into a
rage when they objected during the filming of ``A Fish Called
Wanda.''
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified ``friend'' who said
colleagues were complaining that Cleese had become increasingly like
the sour, abusive hotel keeper he created in the 1970s series
``Fawlty Towers.''
   Dadak said Cleese had actually gotten along very well with fellow
cast members. The film, which also starred Jamie Lee Curtis and
Kevin Kline, was released last year and became one of the year's
biggest hits.

parliamentarian better known as Cicciolina, was convicted Wednesday
of public obscenity and given a suspended sentence.
   Ms. Staller, who earlier called the charge ``absurd,'' waived her
parliamentary immunity in order to stand trial on the accusation
stemming from her September 1987 appearance in Venice's famed St.
Mark's square. She was given a five-month suspended prison sentence.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that witnesses testified
that Ms. Staller was topless and wearing only a see-through skirt
when she arrived at the square in a gondola.
   The witnesses said she blew kisses to admiring fans after she
climbed atop a plaster replica of one of the horse statues in the

   ``Falcon Crest'' lover boy Lorenzo Lamas
married actress Kathleen Kinmont, daughter of his former co-star
Abby Dalton, at a Las Vegas chapel last weekend, his publicist said
Wednesday.
   It was the third marriage for Lamas, 31, son of the late actor
Fernando Lamas and actress Arlene Dahl, and the first for Miss
Kinmont, who is in her early 20s, said Lamas' publicist, Eddie
Michaels.
   The couple exchanged vows Saturday at the Graceland Chapel in the
gambling resort. A.J., Lamas' 5-year-old son by his first wife, was
the ring bearer and their daughter, Shayne, 3, was the flower girl.
   The newlyweds skipped a honeymoon and Lamas returned to work.
   Lamas plays the grandson of scheming matriarch Jane Wyman on
``Falcon Crest,'' CBS' long-running nighttime soap.
   He has been romantically linked to several of his co-stars. He
was once engaged to actress Robin Greer, who appeared as his love
interest on the show. Actress Daphne Ashbrook, who also was on
``Falcon Crest,'' gave birth to Lamas' daughter, Paton Lee, last
September.

   New York University Medical Center was renamed
Tisch Hospital on Wednesday after Laurence A. Tisch, president of
CBS Inc., his brother, Preston Robert, and their families, who have
given $30 million to the facility, officials said.
   The family has contributed more than $45 million over the years
to New York University, which already has a Tisch School of the Arts
and a Tisch Hall at the College of Business and Administration.
   The hospital's name change was formalized Wednesday when a
temporary banner was draped across a canopy at the building's
entrance, the university said.
   ``We are so proud of how the university has emerged as one of the
great institutions in this country,'' said Laurence Tisch, 65,
president and chief executive officer of CBS Inc. and chairman of
Loews Corp.
   He graduated with honors from NYU at 18 and is chairman of the
university's board of trustees.
   Preston Tisch, 62, is president and co-chief executive officer of
Loews Corp. and is a former postmaster general.
   The latest Tisch gift will be used mainly to increase medical
researcher salaries so the university can compete for top scientific

<HEAD>Authorities Raid Companies, Homes in Libya Plant Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities Wednesday raided the
offices of three companies and the homes of 12 people in an
investigation of allegations that West German firms helped Libya
build a suspected chemical weapons plant.
   Some politicians, meanwhile, accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government of bungling West Germany's initial response to the
allegations, and a magazine reported that companies had helped Iraq
build a rocket factory.
   Customs authorities searched the offices and homes ``on suspicion
that export laws had been violated'' with deliveries to the Libyan
plant, said Hubertus Voegele, spokesman for the prosecutor's office
in Offenburg.
   He declined to identify the businesses searched, but confirmed
that the Imhausen-Chemie firm of Lahr was among them.
   Imhausen-Chemie is suspected of playing a major role in building
the factory in Rabta, about 60 miles south of the Libyan capital of
Tripoli.
   U.S. officials say Libya intends to produce poison gas at the
plant. Libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory.
   West German officials who conducted the searches in cities
throughout the country seized a huge quantity of material,
especially from Imhausen-Chemie, that will take time to examine,
Voegele said.
   ``Up to now there are no grounds for any arrests, but we have a
lot of material to go through,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Allegations of West German involvement in the Libyan plant came
to light late last year.
   Kohl's government at first denied any wrongdoing by West German
firms, and exonerated Imhausen-Chemie after an investigation earlier
this month.
   But officials have acknowledged over the past two weeks that
several companies appear to have provided materials or know-how to
the Libyans, including a company owned by the government, Salzgitter
Industriebau AG.
   A day after U.S. senators accused Kohl's government of looking
the other way during such operations, the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the West German parliament met in special session Wednesday to
discuss official handling of the affair.
   Members of the opposition Social Democratic Party singled out
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg for criticism.
   Lawmaker Norbert Gansel said Stoltenberg ``did nothing'' after
learning from the U.S. embassy in Bonn last May that Washington
suspected West German firms of involvement with the Libyan plant.
   Another prominent Social Democrat, Karsten Voigt, said it was
``unbelievable'' Genscher could have been uninformed for months
about intelligence reports that West German firms helped with the
plant.
   Voigt said the scandal had reduced West Germany's international
prestige to ``a low point.''
   Genscher met with World Jewish Congress leader Edgar Bronfman on
Wednesday for talks that centered on the scandal.
   Bronfman said Genscher assured him West Germany would do its best
to see that the Libyan plant would not be used to produce chemical
weapons.
   ``We want to make sure that the teeth of the tiger get pulled,''
Bronfman said.
   Also Wednesday, the weekly magazine Stern said West German
companies were ``heavily involved'' in an Iraqi rocket development
project.
   West German companies had shipped technology and equipment to
Iraq for a ``research and development center that by all indications
is a rocket factory,'' the magazine said.
   It described the factory as a heavily guarded plant near the city
of Mosul, about 210 miles north of Baghdad.
   Stern identified the project's general contractor as Gildemeister
Projekta of Bielefeld.
   A Gildemeister official said the company had made deliveries for
the facility, but called Stern's contention that it was for rocket
production was ``utterly ridiculous.''
   ``We are building a laboratory and workshop complex that
resembles facilities at universities and technical colleges,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There is no way to produce rockets there. At best you can run a
few little experiments,'' he said.
   The official said Gildemeister obtained federal export licenses
for all shipments. Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann confirmed his
ministry had one authorization on file from June.
   Haussmann, who two weeks ago announced tougher measures to
protect against export violations, said better international
coordination is needed to limit the spread of arms and chemical
weapons technology.
   West Germany is the world's fifth-largest supplier of arms and
exports at least half of its chemical production each year. Because
of its dependence on raw material imports and income from
manufactured-goods exports, Bonn has taken a less-confrontational
approach toward nations such as Libya and has avoided trade
sanctions as a lever in political disputes.

   The Senate opened for business Wednesday, and
senators, like merchants at a bazaar, quickly lined up to offer a
dizzying array of legislative proposals.
   And like a bazaar, some of the offerings were shiny new, some
were somewhat shopworn and others were tired and battered and dulled
after years of legislative mauling.
   Among Wednesday's actions:
   _A bipartisan group of senators, opposed to a 50 percent
congressional pay raise, proposed legislation that would roll back
the increase if the House lets it become law by ducking a vote.
   The dozen sponsors, split evenly between Democrats and
Republicans, made clear they wanted to turn up the pressure on the
House _ which appears headed toward allowing the large increase to
become law automatically.
   Chief Senate sponsors Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa, said the rollback provision of their bill would
keep the pressure on the House even if the pay raise becomes law
through House inaction.
   _A proposal for a uniform closing time for polls across the
country during presidential election years. The proposal, by Sens.
Brock Adams, D-Wash., and Donald Riegle, D-Mich., was designed to
eliminate television network projections of presidential races
before the polls are closed in Western states.
   _A bill from Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., that would provide
cost of living increases in compensation, rehabilitation, education
and training benefits paid to veterans who have service-connected
disabilities.
   _Legislation by Sens. William V. Roth, R-Del., and Wendell Ford,
D-Ky., that would put the federal budget on a two-year cycle instead
of the current yearly process.
   _A renewed effort from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to raise
the nation's minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55. The increase, which
would be the first in eight years, died in the closing days of the
100th Congress.
   _An ``ethics in government'' act proposed by Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., that was approved by the 100th Congress but vetoed by
President Reagan last November. The bill restricts former members of
Congress from lobbying the legislative branch and top executive
branch officials for 12 months after leaving government service.
   _A Republican campaign finance reform proposal that would, among
other things, restrict political action committees from giving more
than $1,000 to any one candidate, compared to $5,000 under present
law.
   _Another Republican bill, by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, that would require a report from the president on what
foreign nations are aiding in the production of chemical weapons.
That bill would trigger sanctions against such companies,
prohibiting them from exporting goods into the United States.
   _Another Dole bill would gradually repeal the ``earnings test,''
which restricts the amount retirees under the age of 70 may earn
without losing a portion of their Social Security pension. The law
permits retirees under 65 to earn up to $6,480 a year without
penalty; those 65 to 69 may earn $8,880. For each additional dollar
earned, the beneficiary loses 50 cents of Social Security.
   _A proposal by Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., calling for an
``international alliance for environmental progress.'' The package
would include legislation designed to confront the so-called
greenhouse effect and promote global cooperation on environmental
issues.
   _An AIDS bill proposed by Cranston that would establish a grant
program to help communities develop coordinated systems of care to
people infected with the disease.
   _Also landing in the hopper was a bill to provide more than $1.7
billion to carry out programs contained in last fall's omnibus
narcotics law. Congress approved the drug bill last year but left
town without furnishing federal agencies with the funds to carry out
most of the programs.
   ``Congress is ready to work with the administration to stop the
scourge of drugs,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in unveiling
the measure he is sponsoring with Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
and Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. But he left uncertain exactly how
lawmakers would find the money and still remain within tight budget
constraints.
   _Gilman also vowed to reintroduce his 1988 bill to impose ``a
modest excise tax increase on beer, cigarettes and wine to raise
funding for our war on drugs.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Basnett, a former trade union leader often
blamed by his fellow Laborites for helping to put Conservative
Margaret Thatcher in power, died Wednesday at the age of 64.
   Basnett, who flew Sunderland flying boats in World War II, was
leader of Britain's third-largest union, the 800,000-member General
and Municipal Workers, until he retired in 1986.
   As one of the most powerful union leaders, Basnett forced Edward
Heath, then Conservative prime minister, to abandon a ban on pay
negotiations during an official wage freeze policy in 1973.
   But his union's militancy against pay restraint under a Labor
government in 1978 led to the ``winter of discontent'' when
hospitals were strikebound and the dead went unburied.
   In the following general election in May 1979, Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservatives ousted Labor in the first of three election victories.
   Basnett served on government-appointed bodies and inquiries under
both Labor and Conservative governments and was given a life peerage
in 1987.

<HEAD>Herpes Virus May Help AIDS Virus Cause Disease, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recently discovered herpes virus may activate
the AIDS virus and join with it to kill critical disease-fighting
blood cells in AIDS, a test-tube study says.
   Blood cells infected with both viruses died faster than those
infected with just the AIDS virus, researchers reported in
Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The herpes virus had previously been identified in many people
with acquired immune deficiency sydrome, the researchers said.
   The possible role of the virus in AIDS was discussed publicly
last year by one of the study's co-authors, Robert Gallo of the
National Cancer Institute.
   At that time Gallo said the virus, called herpesvirus-6, appears
to be harmless or produce only mild disease in people not also
infected by the AIDS virus, called HIV-1.
   Herpesvirus-6, discovered in 1986, differs from its better-known
cousins that that cause cold sores or genital infections.
   The new work is reported by scientists at the cancer institute
and Bionetics Research Inc. of Rockville, Md.
   They found that blood cells infected with herpesvirus-6 plus the
AIDS virus died faster than those infected with either virus alone.
The combination killed faster than would be expected if each virus
were acting independently, researchers said.
   Researchers also found evidence that herpesvirus-6 could make the
AIDS more active within cells, and that it could activate a segment
of genetic material in the AIDS virus that regulates reproduction.

<TEXT>
   Officials on Wednesday abandoned hope of
finding any more survivors of the earthquake and mudslide that
inundated three mountain villages, and said this settlement would be
dedicated as a common grave.
   Along with the bad news that no more survivors could expect to be
found, there also was good news: officials said the death toll from
Monday's disaster was only about a quarter of the 1,000 they
originally had estimated.
   In addition, a young man described how his 6-day-old cousin
miraculously survived the quake, held aloft in her father's hands as
he and his household died in a torrent of mud.
   Kholmurod Barotov, 17, a worker in a Sharora bakery, said his
mother had gone to stay with her sister, who had just given birth to
a daughter.
   His aunt's house was completely buried by the mudslide, but the
little girl survived because her father, 30-year-old herdsman
Saifulo Khodzhayev, held her above his head as he and the rest of
the family died, he said.
   ``We will transform the settlement of Sharora into a common grave
with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe,''
said Khusain Kasymov, Communist Party chief in the Tadzhikistan
republic's Gissar region.
   The religious leader of predominantly Moslem Tadzhikistan, Akbar
Kakharov, participated in discussions leading to that decision,
media reports said.
   ``Regrettably, there is no one left who can be saved,'' he told
the official Tass news agency. ``Let the remains of the deceased
remain at the place where they died.''
   ``Moslem law, the Shariah, says that people buried alive must be
left there,'' said Izzatullo Khayoyev, prime minister of the Central
Asian republic.
   He said relatives of those killed in Sharora decided to fence off
the farming settlement and make it into a common grave.
   Within 12 hours of the quake and mudslide that struck the area
early Monday, the official news media estimated that as many as
1,000 people might have died.
   But Khayoyev told reporters in an impromptu interview Wednesday
that 274 people were confirmed dead. ``There may be a differnce of
five or seven people in casualties, but no more,'' he said.
   He said a nationwide census completed only four days before the
quake struck helped provide a quick and accurate count of the
villages' residents.
   Officials said the earthquake, which was recorded as 5.4 on the
Richter scale, toppled all 80 brick-and-straw dwellings in the
settlement of Okuli-bolo, located on the north side of the Babatag
hills about 20 miles southwest of the Tadzhikistan capital Dushanbe.
   The quake loosened saturated soil on both sides of the hill. On
the north side, it came crashing down in seconds onto Sharora, which
was located next to Okuli-bolo.
   But on the south side, about 1} miles away, the mud slipped
slowly down the hill toward Okuli-poyen. The town was destroyed, but
residents managed to escape in time.
   All flags were at half-staff, plays and concerts were canceled,
and restaurants were shut down in Dushanbe and across the small
republic as a day of mourning was declared.
   Khayoyev said losses were estimated at $24 million, according to
Tass.
   He said 75 people had been hospitalized in Dushanbe and Gissar
and that 17 had been discharged.
   The homeless were being put up in mobile wagons, shepherds'
dwellings and tent, Tass said. The number of people involved was not
given.
   Tass said the destroyed villages would be rebuilt elsewhere. ``A
was taken to rebuild at a new place the village of Sharora, which
had been turned into a common grave by underground shocks. Designers
also pinpointed places for other ravaged villages,'' it said.
``Construction will start in several days' time.''

<TEXT>
   A routine inspection of an Eastern Airlines jet
arriving from Colombia failed to reveal a cache of hidden cocaine,
but string holding the drug packets in place broke and the cocaine
dropped into view, authorities said Wednesday.
   Eastern employees spotted the hiding place on the L-1011
passenger jet Tuesday as it was moving from the international
terminal to the domestic departure area to continue its flight to
New York, the U.S. Customs Service said.
   Flight 50 from Cali landed at Miami International Airport just
before 4 p.m. and was routinely searched by Customs inspectors, who
found nothing, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   But the string holding the drug above a lavatory broke, and
packets fell through a ceiling panel, Customs agents said. A second
search revealed 47 pounds of cocaine above the lavatories and in two
exit doors.
   The placement seemed to indicate ``someone with extensive access
to the aircraft and extensive knowledge of its structure'' had
stored the drug, Customs said in a news release. No arrests were
made.
   The jet was released to Eastern, but the Customs Service is
investigating to determine if punitive measures will be taken
against the carrier.

   In a rare public admission, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday a news leak about a
bailout plan for the savings and loan industry was ``a trial
balloon'' floated by the administration to gauge reaction.
   But minutes later, Fitzwater made a speedy retreat, saying he had
been wrong.
   Fitzwater _ as well as President Bush and White House chief of
staff John Sununu _ were bombarded during the day with questions
after the Washington Post reported the administration was
considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan
institutions to help the federal government bail out the troubled
S&amp;L industry.
   After fielding numerous questions, Fitzwater finally told a
packed news briefing, ``What you're looking at today is a trial
balloon.''
   As laughter arose from the press, Fitzwater continued, ``And
we're willing to talk about it, willing to discuss it and we'll see
how it flies. But there will be other trial balloons and I trust
you'll all be here for those explanations, too.''
   When a reporter complimented him on his candor, Fitzwater
laughingly said, ``I wasn't sure it was a trial balloon till I had a
call at 6 a.m. this morning that said, `The story leaked last night
and the Secretary of the Treasury (Nicholas Brady) is on three
(television) talk shows this morning.'''
   ``That's a dead giveaway,'' the press secretary said.
   Shortly after his briefing, Fitzwater circulated through the
press room to change his story, saying he was ``back-pedaling on the
trial balloon.''
   He said he was wrong in suggesting Brady went on television to
sell the savings and loan plan. Instead, he said, Brady had
consented to the interviews to talk about leveraged buyouts, and was
hit with questions about S&amp;L plan in the wake of the Post story.
   ``It was not an intentional trial-balloon,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Flag-Burner Defends Action With Bush Phrase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose flag-burning conviction in Texas is
the focus of a Supreme Court case on the limits of permissible
public protest said Wednesday that setting fire to the American flag
is his idea of ``a thousand points of light.''
   Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, a member of the Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade, told a news conference the court case is an
opportunity to examine the real meaning of the flag.
   Around the world ``wherever people rise up ... quite often one of
the first things they do is torch the red, white and blue,'' Johnson
said. ``Now that's what I call a thousand points of light.''
   Johnson's sarcastic echo of one of President Bush's campaign
themes underscored the timely nature of the court dispute.
   Bush, stressing patriotic values during his campaign, attacked
Democratic opponent Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts for
vetoing legislation to require that Massachusetts public school
teachers lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   The high court announced last October it will consider
reinstating Johnson's flag-burning conviction that was overturned by
a Texas appeals court. The state court said burning the flag was a
form of symbolic expression protected by the Constitution.
   The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in March
or April and announce a decision by July.
   Johnson, 32, and living in New York City now, was sentenced to a
year in jail and fined $2,000 for his part in a demonstration during
the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas.
   The protest culminated with a rally in front of Dallas City Hall
in which demonstrators poured lighter fluid on an American flag and
ignited it.
   Johnson said Wednesday he had no part directly in igniting the
flag although he approved the action and gave speeches during the
rally.
   He said he believed he was singled out for prosecution because
the Dallas police knew he was a member in the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade.
   The Center for Constitutional Rights, which is representing
Johnson, filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court on Wednesday
urging it not to revive Johnson's conviction.
   David Cole said the case ``seems to be a return to the 1960s''
when protests against the war in Vietnam were reaching their peak.
   He said the state of Texas ``is saying that it and it alone can
define the meaning of the flag and that it can prohibit private
citizens acting in a political context from using even their own
flag for any purpose contrary to that defined by the state.''
   The Texas law used to prosecute Johnson forbids ``the desecration
of a venerated object'' if that is likely to cause ``serious
offense.''
   Police officers who arrested Johnson said they were seriously
offended by the flag burning.
   Cole said many states _ as well as the federal government _ have
laws against burning the flag, although it does not appear there are
many cases where the statutes have been enforced.
   The Supreme Court in 1974 threw out the conviction of a college
student who taped a peace symbol onto a flag. The court in 1943
ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute the
flag. But the justices never have decided whether laws against
destruction of the flag are constitutional.

   Former President Reagan is expected to command
more than $30,000 a speech on the lecture circuit, but his first
formal post-White House engagement will be a 78th birthday freebie.
   Reagan will address students at the University of Southern
California on Feb. 6, his birthday, and discuss his future, the
university announced. Free seats to the address will be allocated by
lottery.
   ``Mr. Reagan is looking forward to speaking with students and
revealing what he plans to do in the near future,'' Reagan spokesman
Mark Weinberg said Wednesday.
   Reagan hasn't disclosed his post-White House plans other than to
say he will be on the lecture circuit, pushing for conservatism. A
book deal for his memoirs was announced in New York on Wednesday,
and he is expected to sit on boards of several corporations.
   Reagan, as California governor, spoke at USC in 1977, and he was
president when he addressed students again in 1984. Then-Vice
President George Bush also addressed Southern Cal students that year.

   Florida Vietnam veterans on Wednesday
received a POW-MIA flag flown aboard last month's space shuttle
mission from Atlantis commander Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson.
   ``We were by far the most ideal crew, I'm sure, to be carrying
something like this,'' Gibson told about 20 camouflage-clad veterans
who gathered with their families for the presentation at Kennedy
Space Center.
   Members of Veterans of Vietnam War Post FL-3 in Crystal River
asked NASA to stow the black-and-white flag aboard the shuttle when
they realized Atlantis would be flown by an all-military crew, said
post commander Warren Stines.
   All the astronauts who flew the shuttle's secret mission in
December are military officers, and three of the five were fighter
pilots in southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Gibson, a Navy
commander, was a ``topgun'' who flew combat missions from the U.S.S.
Coral Sea and the U.S.S. Enterprise.
   While the Atlantis astronauts were welcomed back from space with
parties and fanfare, Gibson said, Vietnam veterans ``faced a whole
lot different world.''
   ``When we all came back, there were no real celebrations, there
were no welcome homes,'' Gibson recalled. ``If we faced anyone, we
faced protesters and picketers.''

   The government wants substantial
cuts in the number of U.S. nuclear warheads in Europe as part of its
goal of reducing to an ``absolute minimum'' the role of the weapons
there, it was reported Wednesday.
   The ZDF network quoted from a position paper prepared by various
government ministries in Bonn and approved by the Federal Security
Council. It did not say when the document was approved.
   The government position still calls for ``effective'' nuclear
forces in Europe, despite the envisioned reductions, and views the
U.S. military presence as ``irreplaceable,'' according to ZDF.
   West Germany has been reassessing its stance on nuclear missiles
in hopes of improving ties with the Soviet Bloc. The missile issue
remains particularly sensitive in this country on the front lines of
the East-West conflict.
   For example, Defense Minister Rupert Scholz's statement earlier
this month that West Germany would agree to the replacement of 600
Lance short-range missiles sparked such a furor he later retracted
it.
   ZDF said that according to the document, ``the federal government
wants to cut the role of nuclear weapons to the `absolute minimum
necessary.'''
   ``The number of U.S. nuclear warheads stored in Europe should be
reduced unilaterally _ probably to less than 2,900 from the current
number of approximately 4,600,'' it quoted the document as saying.
   ``However, a necessary minimum needed for the credible deterrence
in Europe should be kept,'' ZDF said in reporting the government's
stance.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Col. Werner Widder said most of
the report already was public knowledge.
   However, Widder refused to confirm the federal government was
aiming to cut the number of U.S. nuclear warheads to less than 2,900.
   West Germans have applauded the removal of intermediate-range
nuclear missiles provided for in the treaty signed in December 1987
by the Soviet Union and United States.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has been leading the
calls for further steps toward disarmament and for greater trust in
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   West German public opinion polls have shown a growing trust in
the Soviet bloc.
   A new survey presented by ZDF as part of its report Wednesday
said 88 percent of those polled do not feel militarily threatened by
Soviet bloc countries. It said only 10 percent were in favor of
replacing the aging Lance missiles pointed at East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   ZDF said the poll was conducted by an outside research institute
and surveyed 1,017 West German citizens. It did not provide a margin
of error.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today searched the
offices of three West German companies and the homes of 12 people
suspected of helping Libya build a chemical weapons factory,
authorities said.
   A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Offenburg, Hubertus
Voegele, said one of the firms was Imhausen-Chemie in Lahr, which is
suspected of playing a major role in building and equipping the
Libyan plant.
   Voegele said the searches were conducted ``on suspicion that
export laws had been violated.'' He declined to name the other firms
whose offices were searched, but added they were located throughout
the country.
   The U.S. government says the plant at Rabta, 60 miles south of
the Libyan capital of Tripoli, was built to make poison gas. Libya
says it will manufacture medicine.
   Bonn officials initially dismissed the U.S. allegations, but have
now launched a criminal investigation to determine if
Imhausen-Chemie and other companies illegally shipped arms,
hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them.
   The affair has deeply embarassed the West German government.
   On Tuesday, news reports said an Imhausen-Chemie employee had
confirmed allegations the company played a key role in building the
Libyan plant.
   The weekly Stern magazine said Imhausen-Chemie and a
government-owned company were aware that blueprints that were
supposed to be shipped to Hong Kong to build a pharmaceuticals plant
had ended up in Libya.
   The ARD television network late Tuesday reported that Klaus Hess,
a technical draftsman with Imhausen-Chemie, ``is said to have given
evidence that Imhausen shipped parts and chemicals to Libya, and
further that Imhausen employees helped build the facility in Rabta.''
   ARD did not disclose the source of its information, but said the
details were confirmed by the prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. The
television also did not say if the employees traveled to Libya to
work on the plant.
   Imhausen-Chemie has denied accusations it was involved in the
Rabta plant.
   This week's Stern said an official at Imhausen-Chemie told
investigators that officials at Imhausen and the government-owned
Salzgitter Industriebau knew shipments of Salzgitter blueprints
ended up in Libya instead of Hong Kong.
   The magazine did not name the official and it was not known
whether it was the same person identified in the ARD report.
   Salzgitter officials acknowledged last week that the firm had
done business with Imhausen-Chemie, but said it involved
construction of a pharmaceuticals plant in Hong Kong. Salzgitter
officials late Tuesday denied any involvement in the Rabta project.
   In its report, Stern also said it had been clear to experts
working for Salzgitter that the Libyan plant was not designed as a
small factory for pharmaceuticals but as a ``large chemical plant
for the production of highly poisonous substances.''
   The magazine reported last week that Salzgitter, which
manufactures steel products and industrial equipment, delivered
blueprints for the Libyan plant.
   Voegele has confirmed that an Imhausen-Chemie employee had been
questioned but declined to reveal what that person told
investigators.
   Last week, Stern said the Hong Kong project, called ``Pharma
150,'' was devised to disguise involvement by Imhausen-Chemie in
helping build the plant in Libya, which has the same name.
   The magazine said this week that Siemens, the giant West German
electrical firm, sold switching and measuring equipment for ``Pharma
150.''
   Siemens spokesman Horst Siebert said the company had delivered
equipment to Hong Kong and said it had not done anything wrong.
   Stern telexed its report Tuesday to other news organizations in
advance of Thursday's publication.

   A government science panel has dismissed as
``seriously flawed'' a study that concluded Vietnam veterans
suffered post-war physical problems due to exposure to the herbicide
Agent Orange.
   A report sent Congress on Wednesday concluded that data in the
study conducted for the American Legion ``do not support the
conclusions drawn by the authors.''
   The American Legion study was reviewed for Congress by the Agent
Orange working group of the Department of Health and Human Service's
Domestic Policy Council.
   ``The study is seriously flawed due to major problems in study
design and execution,'' the panel said in a memo written by its
chairman, Dr. Vernon N. Houk, director of the Center for
Environmental Health and Injury Control.
   The study, released last November, contradicted other studies by
the Veterans Administration and the federal Centers for Disease
Control. Their studies have found no significant health differences
among veterans of the Vietnam era, regardless of whether they
actually served in Southeast Asia.
   The Legion's study said there were ``significant dose-related
relationships between skin exposure to herbicides and subsequent
development of skin conditions such as rash with blisters and change
in skin color.'' It also connected Agent Orange exposure to benign
fatty tumors and risk for miscarriage among wives of von to Vietnam veterans
based on exposure to
Agent Orange.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp., a major defense
contractor, said it elected former Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci to its board of directors Wednesday.
   About 20 percent of the company's annual sales of nearly $11
billion come from business with the Pentagon.
   Carlucci, 58, departed government service Friday with the
inauguration of George Bush and immediately became vice chairman of
the Carlyle Group, Washington-based takeover specialists whose
takeover bid was rejected last week by the space and defense
contractor Fairchild Industries.
   He also was vice chairman beginning in January 1983 and chairman
beginning in October 1984 at Sears World Trade Inc., an
international trading arm that the giant retailer Sears formed and
later shut down.
   Carlucci became defense secretary under President Reagan in
November 1987.
   ``We are extremely pleased to have a distinguished executive of
Mr. Carlucci's stature join the Westinghouse board,'' said Chairman
John C. Marous.
   Westinghouse set defense sales and profit records in 1987 with
the help of $3 billion in sales of radar for the F-16 fighter plane,
the largest single defense contract in the company's history.
   The Pittsburgh company also provides a variety of other types of
military radar, electronic countermeasures equipment, torpedoes,
naval propulsion systems and electricity generators.

   Sixteen drug smugglers were hanged in Iran
on Wednesday, following a major anti-narcotics crackdown backed by a
draconian new law, Tehran radio reported.
   Ten key members of a large, armed gang were hanged in Tehran, two
smugglers were executed in neighboring Varamin, and four in western
Bakhtaran province said the broadcast, monitored in Nicosia.
   These deaths raised to 89 the number of drug smugglers executed
since the crackdown started Jan. 16. More than 1,000 people have
been arrested in the same period in what Iranian newspapers describe
as ``the biggest crackdown on drug smuggling in Iranian history.''
   The new anti-narcotics law, which went into effect Saturday,
carries the death penalty for possession of just over an ounce of
heroin and for 11 pounds of opium or hashish.
   The broadcast said those executed were responsible for smuggling
more than 17,380 pounds of opium, 237 pounds of heroin and 1,531
pounds of morphine.
   Police also seized weapons, ammunition and vehicles found in the
smugglers' hideouts.
   The broadcast did not say whether the smugglers brought drugs
into or out of Iran. Iranian smugglers often are involved both in
importing drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan and exporting drugs
through Turkey and Persian Gulf countries.

   Inns of Court _ four societies to which all barristers and senior
judges belong. The four are Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple, Middle
Temple and Gray's Inn, reflecting legal practice dating at least to
the 14th century. The buildings now are largely used as offices
although some people are resident. The Inns are governed by judges
and senior barristers, who are known as ``benchers,'' and they
decide who will be admitted as students or called to the bar.

<TEXT>
   Confining the 250 men on death row to
their cells creates dangerous suspicions among them, a convicted
murderer testified Wednesday as a hearing on a federal lawsuit
convened in San Quentin prison.
   Lead-off witness Rodney Alcala, convicted of kidnapping and
murdering a 12-year-old girl, called for allowing the prisoners to
mingle on tiers outside the cells, so ``you know what everybody's
attitude is, what's going on in everybody's head.''
   ``It's like if you live in a neighborhood and there's one guy who
never comes out of his house, you don't know what the guy's going to
do. ... That's pretty important in our situation.''
   The men awaiting possible execution in the San Quentin gas
chamber were called to testify in a lawsuit that claims state prison
officials are violating a 1980 court order on their housing and
treatment in an isolated wing of the institution.
   Among other things, the lawsuit contends the inmates are not
given adequate access to the prison law library, are improperly
prohibited from leaving their cells in the daytime, and are denied
some of the exercise equipment and personal items guaranteed by the
court order.
   The state agreed to abide by the order in 1980, but officials say
it has become obsolete and should be relaxed or repealed.
   State officials say the growth in death row population from 40 in
1980 to the current 250 has increased the cost and security risk of
complying with some provisions. They also say U.S. Supreme Court
rulings since 1980, broadening prison officials' leeway to determine
prison conditions, have made it clear that conditions at San Quentin
comply with the Constitution.
   The 1980 order is ``at best irrelevant to the dictates of the
law, and at worst a dangerous and extravagant interference with
professional prison management,'' Deputy Attorney General John
Donhoff said in court papers.
   Lawyers for the prisoners say the state has no legal reason for
violating the order, only a political motive to avoid appearing soft
on convicted killers.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel, who signed the 1980 order,
assigned the hearing to his former law clerk, attorney Robert Riggs,
who acts as a monitor of the state's compliance with Weigel's orders
in several lawsuits over conditions at state prisons.
   Riggs, in a report filed before the hearing started last week,
found apparent violations of various provisions, including
requirements to furnish an adequate law library, allow condemned
prisoners out of their cells for meals and other activities during
the daytime, and provide a covered exercise yard.
   He ordered the state to show why it should not be held in
contempt of court for violating Weigel's order.
   The hearing began in San Francisco federal court last week and
was shifted across the bay to San Quentin for the inmates' testimony.

   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Wednesday urged Congress to move cautiously in trying
to use tax law changes to stem the current wave of leveraged buyouts.
   ``You should be aware that your committee's activities may
influence a stock market that is skittish and nervous,'' SEC
Chairman David Ruder told the Senate Finance Committee.
   Ruder said SEC studies after the October 1987 stock market crash
showed that one factor contributing to its severity was legislation
then being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee to
curtail some of the deductions on interest paid by companies to
holders of high-yield junk bonds.
   Ruder admitted that the double taxation of dividends _ first as
part of the 34 percent income tax on corporations and again when
they are distributed to shareholders as personal income _ is helping
drive the leveraged buyout or LBO phenomenon.
   But he said he opposed taxing the interest that leveraged
companies pay on junk bonds as a way of equalizing the tax treatment
between the two primary means for raising captital: debt or bonds
and stock or equity.
   Ruder, like Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady who testified
before him on Tuesday, said the better alternative would be to allow
companies to treat as a deductible expense the dividends they pay or
to give shareholders a tax credit for the corporate income taxes
paid by a company.
   But, also like Brady, he added, ``I do not believe we can do that
given our enormous deficit problem.''
   In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy
out stockholders and take over the company. Often LBOs are proposed
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover.
   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of
the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear the high
debt levels, in a recession, would endanger both the bought-out
company and the banks and brokerage firms financing the buyout.
   Both the tax-writing Finance and Ways and Means committees are
re-examining leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $25
billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Co. by LBO specialist Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and the $13 billion buyout of Kraft Inc. by
Phillip Morris Co. last year.
   Those were the two biggest of more than 300 leveraged buyouts
totaling nearly $100 billion in 1988.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., the Finance Committee's chairman,
said the primary concern is the possibility the recent surge of
leveraged buyouts ``has created a mountain of corporate debt that
will make our next recession deeper and longer than it needs to be.''
   While Bentsen said the goal is to balance the attractiveness of
equity and debt financing that is clearly tilted to the debt side
under current tax laws, but he acknowledged it is going to be
difficult to find the right combination of ``carrots and sticks.''

   Continued captivity of 15 Western hostages
held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon has lost its
political usefulness, the An-Nahar daily reported Wednesday.
   ``A diplomatic source says that the foreign hostages' issue has
lost its political importance and is being dealt with at the
humanitarian and financial levels,'' the respected daily said.
   The one-paragraph report did not elaborate.
   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a
Belgian are missing in Lebanon.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, Chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the
captives. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   An-Nahar has been cautious in its hostage reporting and has not
made unfulfilled predictions or reported developments which later
turned out to be false.
   Iran has been trying to improve political and trade ties with the
West since last summer, when it agreed to a cease-fire in its
eight-year war with Iraq.

   Officials from OPEC and independent oil-producing
nations huddled separately Wednesday to plot strategy for Thursday's
joint meeting over cooperation in supporting crude oil prices.
   Afterward, the independent group indicated support for OPEC's
attempt to limit production and stated both producer and consumer
nations would be served by stabilizing prices.
   A senior OPEC source said separately that he was hopeful the
cartel could reach agreement for output cuts by the independent
producers, but said that wasn't likely to happen immediately.
   ``Our unity is stronger now. Prices have strengthened and we are
ready'' for a cooperative agreement, said the senior OPEC source,
who requested anonymity.
   ``This is the first step in a step-by-step move'' to push up oil
prices, he said.
   A similar joint meeting was held last April, when six non-OPEC
producers met with representatives of the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and suggested they jointly cut their
exports by 5 percent. OPEC rejected that proposal.
   This time, some of the seven attending non-OPEC producers might
offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent, without
asking for reciprocal cuts from OPEC, non-OPEC sources have said
this week.
   The independents likely will want OPEC reassurance that the
cartel would not increase its own production if they went ahead with
their cuts.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely-traded
international crude oil, was $16.55 a barrel late Wednesday in
London, up 54 cents from late Tuesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate jumped 58 cents Wednesday to settle at $18.12 a
barrel, after closing 21 cents higher on Tuesday.
   OPEC experts from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Indonesia,
Venezuela and Nigeria met for several hours Wednesday at the
Indonesian Embassy.
   At a brief news conference after the meeting, OPEC director
general Subroto described the gathering as a preparatory meeting of
cartel technicians.
   He said technicians for OPEC and the non-OPEC nations would meet
Thursday morning to exchange information ``and we will see the
market together and then what we can do together.''
   The groups planned to issue a joint statement afterward, Subroto
said.
   The non-OPEC group issued a communique afterward saying that
representatives of Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico,
and Oman met with observers from the Soviet Union, Norway, the Yemen
Arab Republic and the Canadian province of Alberta and the U.S.
states of Alaska and Texas.
   ``The delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oil
market stabilize, an issue they consider of importance to both
consumers and producers of oil,'' the communique read. ``This shared
responsibility was perceived in spite of the variety of outlooks
represented at the meeting.''
   ``The delegates were satisfied that the OPEC conference held in
Vienna last November had produced very positive results and they
expressed the hope that those efforts would be sustained throughout
the first half of 1989,'' the communique read.

<HEAD>Study: Psychiatric Drugs Abused in Rest Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Powerful tranquilizers with potentially dangerous
side effects are being widely given to elderly people in rest homes,
often by untrained aides without medical supervision, a study
concludes.
   Such drugs are available only through a doctor's prescription,
but many patients continue to be given the drugs months or years
after examination by a doctor, the study's principal author said
Wednesday.
   ``It may well be that when they first started getting the stuff
they needed it,'' said Dr. Jerry Avorn of the Beth Israel Hospital
and Harvard Medical School in Boston. ``It may be that some people
still need it.'' But without follow-up examinations, there is no
assurance that the drugs are being used properly, he said.
   Drugs like Thorazine and Haldol, which are meant to treat
psychotic patients, can cause a disfiguring and sometimes
irreversible problem called tardive dyskinesia, in which patients
develop uncontrollable facial twitches.
   Avorn found that use of the drugs is not limited to treatment of
psychotics.
   ``Sometimes they are used as sedatives, and that's not a good
idea, because they will have side effects that outweigh their
advantages,'' Avorn said.
   Too high a dose of the drugs can increase confusion and lethargy,
thereby raising the chances that patients will fall and injure
themselves, Avorn said.
   ``If you over-sedate a person, you are quite likely to put them
at risk of a fall that can lead to considerable disability or
death,'' he said.
   Twenty percent of elderly people who fracture their hips, for
example, will die within one year, Avorn said.
   Avorn, with Stephen B. Soumerai of Harvard and Paul Dreyer and
Kathleen Connelly of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health,
surveyed 55 rest homes in Massachusetts. These are institutions for
the care of elderly people not sick enough to be in nursing homes
but too frail to live on their own, Avorn said.
   The researchers found that 55 percent of the 1,201 residents were
taking at least one psychiatric drug, and 39 percent were taking
so-called major tranquilizers such as Thorazine and Haldol.
   In a further study of 837 residents at 44 nursing homes, the
researchers found that about half had apparently not seen a doctor
for evaluation of their mental health for at least a year.
   One-third of the residents did poorly on standard tests of mental
function. ``It certainly raises the question of whether the
medication might contribute in part to this lack of ability,'' Avorn
said.
   Six percent of the residents had moderate to severe cases of
tardive dyskinesia.
   The findings will appear Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Dr. Stanley Slater, director of the geriatric research and
training program at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda,
Md., said Avorn's study ``is not surprising, but of course it's a
concern.''
   ``Places for the care of the institutionalized elderly are
constrained by a lack of resources, so that most of the care comes
from nonprofessionals,'' Slater said. ``The people who provide the
care are often minimum-wage employees.''
   Avorn said that although the survey was limited to rest homes in
Massachusetts, the findings are probably typical of what's happening
elsewhere. ``We are pretty representative of this level of care
around the country,'' he said.
   In December, Avorn and his colleagues reported on a similar
misuse of mood altering drugs in nursing homes.

   The Bush administration asked Congress on
Wednesday to change U.S. trade rules that international panels say
violate an agreement with other trading countries.
   ``If we want other nations to eliminate... illegal trade barriers
when we win before a panel, we must be equally prepared to change
our actions and policies when we lose,'' said Judith H. Bello,
general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative.
   She was testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee's
subcommittee on international trade.
   ``We must show we're not a scofflaw,'' Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,
agreed. He is chairman of the subcommittee and a major force in
trade policy.
   The accord is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
which has nearly 100 governments as members. The GATT organization
sponsors the ``Uruguay round'' negotiations in which the U.S.
government has been trying unsuccessfully for a long-term agreement
on ending subsidies to farmers. These subsidies cost consumers and
taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year.
   Ms. Bello said the rules she wants changed are more important
than they seem because there are widespread doubts among other
negotiators about U.S. intentions.
   At issue in Tuesday's hearing was a tax on imports of petroleum
and some petroleum products passed by Congress in 1986 to help
finance a ``superfund'' for cleaning up toxic waste. The tax on
imported products was 11.7 cents a barrel, 3.5 cents more than the
tax on U.S. production of the same items.
   In June 1987, an international panel ruled that the difference
was a discrimination against other countries and a violation of
GATT. Other governments threatened to retaliate against the United
States. To avoid that, the Reagan administration offered to
negotiate compensation with the countries affected. There have been
talks with Canada, Mexico and the 12 countries represented by the
European Economic Community, but no conclusion has been reached.
   The community estimates that the tax costs its member countries
$26.6 million a year. Ms. Bello said it would be preferable to get
rid of the differential.
   Also at issue is a ``user fee'' for work done by the U.S. Customs
Service, based on the value of products imported. Another
international panel ruled that also was a violation of the accord,
which says such fees should be based on actual cost to the Customs
Service.
   According to Ella Krucoff, press officer for the European
Community in Washington, its members paid $22.2 million in such fees
in 1987.
   ``The U.S. fee must be revised to tie it more closely to the
actual cost of processing particular entries,'' Ms. Bello said.
   The program brought in $787 million last year, according to Harry
W. Carnes, director of the U.S. Customs Service User Fee Task Force.

<HEAD>Soviets To Buy More Grain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union has been given the go-ahead to
buy more U.S. grain than had been previous specified, including more
quantities of wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department
announced Wednesday.
   In one action, the Soviets were told they can now buy up to 20
million metric tons of grain in the 1988-89 year, up from 16 million
tons specified earlier. Purchases already total more than 12 million
tons.
   The department also said the Soviets have bought another 150,000
tons of soybean meal, which has a potential current market value of
about $36 million.
   Under a long-term grain agreement, the Soviet Union was
originally limited to 12 million tons of U.S. grain a year, but that
was increased to 16 million tons on Dec. 23. The agreement had
expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Officials said the increase for 1988-89 ``takes into account
recent public confirmation by Soviet authorities'' that the Soviet
Union's grain harvest last year was below expectations.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg also announced that
Moscow has been authorized an additional 2 million tons of wheat
that it can buy under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Earlier this week, for example, the department announced an EEP
wheat sale to the Soviet Union of 635,000 tons, or about 23.3
million bushels. The subsidies shaved $23.05 per ton off the regular
market price, or about 63 cents per bushel.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales of wheat and corn now total more than 11.6 million tons for
delivery in the sixth year of the agreement which began last Oct. 1.
That includes about 10.2 million tons of corn and 1.4 million tons
of wheat. In addition, the Soviets have bought 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.28 million tons of soybean meal, and 500,000 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Under the agreement, each ton of soybeans or meal counts for two
tons of grain.
   Only wheat is approved for sale to the Soviet Union under the EEP
subsidy arrangement.

<HEAD>Shelter Opens To Homeless Staying At Stadium</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last of the homeless people staying at a
baseball stadium are being moved into the first permanent shelter
funded by the city, an official said Wednesday.
   Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium was opened in mid-December to homeless
people, including newly arrived Central Americans. But the stadium
is the spring home of the Baltimore Orioles, whose representatives
have arrived to begin preparations for ticket sales starting Feb. 10.
   The city and Dade County agreed to split the $175,000 cost of
renovating Beckham Hall Annex, a former youth facility that has been
converted into a 150-bed dormitory for the homeless.
   Mark Coats, assistant to the city coordinator of homeless
projects, said the move would be completed by Thursday. The city had
hoped to move the homeless sooner, but work at the annex was slower
than expected.
   At its peak as a homeless shelter, the stadium housed 413 people
a night. The Central Americans were placed by late last week in
housing partly paid for with $20,000 in donations to the city and
$76,000 raised by Spanish-language stations. The Roman Catholic
archdiocese opened a 171-bed shelter, and about 150 beds already
have been filled.
   But 150 homeless Americans remained at the stadium, meaning the
annex probably would be full as soon as it opened, Coats said.
   Dade County's homeless number 8,700 in summer and 10,000 in
winter, estimates Brother Paul Johnson, who operates the Camillus
House shelter and soup kitchen for the Brothers of the Good Shepherd.

<HEAD>North Defense Subpoenas Two House Members for Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>

   Fired National Security Council aide Oliver
North subpoenaed former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Lee
Hamilton and Rep. David McCurdy for North's upcoming trial in the
Iran-Contra case, one of the congressmen confirmed Wednesday.
   Also, North has subpoenaed records from three House panels that
tried unsuccessfully during 1985-1986 to determine what action he
was taking on the Contras' behalf. A House reply that sought to
quash portions of the subpoenas complained that he sought ``the
broadest imaginable range'' of documents.
   At a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said the
matter of subpoenaing two congressmen must be approached with ``some
degree of accommodation'' and that ``we're not going to pull them
off the floor'' of Congress to testify at North's trial.
   North attorney Barry Simon didn't identify the two congressmen.
However, McCurdy, an Okahoma Democrat and a member of the House
Intelligence Committee, confirmed in an interview that he and
Hamilton had been subpoenaed by North. Hamilton, D-Ind., chaired the
committee during 1985-86 and is no longer a member of the committee.
   A hearing is scheduled for Friday to hear all objections to
North's subpoenas, including those seeking testimony from former
President Reagan and President Bush.
   Two House staff members also have been subpoenaed by North, Simon
said, and congressional sources identified them as House
Intelligence Committee employees.
   The House filed a 22-page motion seeking to quash large portions
of North's request for documents from the House committees on
intelligence, foreign affairs and armed services. The filing said
the House ``stands ready'' to provide all documents which are
``material and relevant for the trial'' which is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday.
   Nort, according to the House filing, hopes to show that the
committees in 1985 and 1986 already knew about his efforts on behalf
of the Contras from other sources, making it irrelevant whether he
misled or told the truth in responding to questions about his
activities from Capitol Hill.
   The former NSC aide ``asserts that what North was allegedly
concealing in 1985-86 chiefly by false statements and document
alteration and destruction House committees knew from other
sources,'' said the House filing.
   North ``reasons that hence no crimes occurred, for what the House
knew, North could not conceal from it.''
   North's ``dragnet subpoena'' is ``based on an amazing theory that
failure'' to obstruct Congress ``is a defense to an obstruction
charge,'' the House filing concluded.
   North's House document subpoenas require ``surrender of the
broadest imaginable range of privileged documents,'' said the filing
by Steven Ross, counsel to the House clerk.
   North is seeking everything the House committees have regarding
providing support to the Contras by private benefactors, third
countries, John Singlaub, North's courier to the Contras Robert Owen
and co-defendant Richard Secord, who North enlisted to run the
resupply operation.
   North subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligence
panel's probe of the Contra resupply operation, which began after a
Contra resupply plane with American crewman Eugene Hasenfus aboard
was shot down in Nicaragua in October 1986.
   Ross also disclosed that North's attorneys at one point delivered
to House counsel a subpoena for the House as a whole, asking ``for
records from the files of every member.'' North's attorneys were
told that House counsel wasn't authorized to accept service of such
a subpoena.
   North issued two subpoenas Dec. 28, for the intelligence and
foreign affairs committees, and issued two more subpoenas on
Inauguration Day, to the armed services and foreign affairs panels,
the House disclosed in its court filing.
   Four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against North are that
in 1985 he concealed from Congress his alleged efforts on behalf of
the Contras to raise funds, arrange arms shipments or offer tactical
advice. Another count says he concealed similar information at an
August 1986 meeting in the White House Situation Room with members
and staff of the House intelligence committee. North is charged
additionally with obstructing Congress in November 1986 by altering,
destroying and concealing documents on the Iran arms shipments and
aid to the Contras.
   Meanwhile, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, in a court filing,
supported the government's motion to quash North's subpoena issued
while Ronald Reagan was still president for any presidential
documents concerning the arms sales to Iran and support for the
Contras. Walsh also supported quashing a separate North subpoena to
the executive office's custodian of records seeking videotapes and
audio tapes of speeches by Reagan or then-Vice President George Bush
supporting the Contras and documents on post-trip briefings for
Reagan or Bush on the Contras.
   Walsh said North's subpoenas for presidential documents are an
attempt to ``delay the start of trial by requiring the Government to
provide massive, unnecessary pretrial discovery.''

<HEAD>Army to Use Fewer Reservists In Cost-Cutting Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army said Wednesday it is replacing
reserve soldiers with infantry and paramilitary police to reduce the
time Israelis must serve in the reserve and to cut the cost of
controlling the Palestinian uprising.
   Since the uprising began more than 13 months ago, reserve duty
has increased by about a third, and the army's recent get-tough
policy in the occupied territories has come under increasing
criticism by Jews and Arabs alike.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Wednesday, six
Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli soldiers,
Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   Israeli and Arab reports said Jewish settlers in the West Bank
invaded the Arab village of Bidya on Tuesday night to protest an
injury to a 16-year-old settler from a stone and emulated leaders of
the Palestinian uprising by issuing a warning leaflet.
   ``You must know that such things, if they continue, will hurt
you, your property and your security,'' said leaflet No. 1 from the
settlers in nearby Ariel. ``We are calling on you before it is too
late and patience is lost.''
   Gen. Ehud Barak, deputy chief of staff, spoke of the personnel
changes at a news conference in which he was repeatedly asked about
growing Palestinian casualties in the occupied territories with the
introduction of a get-tough policy against stone-throwing protesters.
   Barak said mobilized infantry units already have been deployed
throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and now make up
about 10 percent of the troops handling the revolt against Israeli
occupation.
   ``We are trying to make these extra units more effective, more
mobile,'' Barak said.
   Regular soldiers also have been reinforced with paramilitary
border police patrols, whose strength has been increased by about 50
percent in recent months, he said.
   He refused to discuss specific troop strength for security
reasons, but some reports have said an average of 10,000 Israeli
troops have been deployed in the territories on any given day.
   Barak said one aim of using the police units was to try to reduce
the amount of reserve duty that Israelis have been asked to perform
over the past 13 months.
   Reservists last year served an average of about 60 days, he said,
greatly increasing defense spending and interfering with the
reservists' lives.
   He said the goal was to cut this to between 42 and 44 days in the
fiscal year starting April 1, or about the level it was before the
uprising.
   The deployment goals for reservists reflect reports that the
Defense Ministry hopes to cut its spending for controlling the
uprising from $222 million in the 16-months ending March 31 to about
$124 million in the following 12 months.
   The army is facing growing criticism over its policies in
territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   Settlers have complained soldiers were not tough enough, and
left-wing Israelis have questioned whether troops were not firing
too freely. Some reserve soldiers also complained last week they
were forced to beat Palestinians to keep order.
   Recent complaints have centered on new policies allowing soldiers
to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians fleeing stone-throwing
protests or blocking roads with stone barricades.
   Barak defended the use of plastic bullets, introduced by the army
as less lethal than standard lead ammunition, but confirmed reports
plastic bullets killed 47 Palestinians since they came into use in
July.
   He said about a third of those deaths and most of the Palestinian
casualties came as soldiers fired in a ``life-threatening
situation,'' but he said some deaths were due to mistakes.
   According to hospital figures, 368 Palestinians have been killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis also have
died.
   Barak gave slightly lower figures, saying 352 Palestinians were
killed, including 289 who died from in army gunfire.
   He said at least 30 were killed by fellow Palestinians. He did
not give other reasons, but there are some cases where Jewish
settlers are being investigated for killing Palestinians.
   Barak said more than 40 Israeli civilians and about 300 soldiers
have been wounded in the uprising. He said that 4,300 Palestinians
have been wounded but did not explain the difference from a
months-old figure listing at least 7,000 Palestinians injured.

   Zacharry Dacri, who lived only seven weeks
before he was drowned in a bathtub and then dismembered, was buried
Wednesday in a suburban cemetery.
   His 20-year-old mother, Tanya Dacri, is charged with murder and
abuse of a corpse. Police said she told officers she killed her son
Jan. 7 because she couldn't cope with his constant crying. A court
Tuesday rejected her request to be let out of jail long enough to
attend the funeral.
   Her 22-year-old husband, Phillip Dacri, is free on bail on
charges he helped his wife dispose of the child's remains.
   Mrs. Dacri first claimed Zacharry was kidnapped at a shopping
mall, but then acknowledged the boy had been drowned and his
dismembered body disposed of. Police recovered the boy's body from
two creeks.
   The father was among about 50 relatives and friends at St. Martin
of Tours Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday, when the white-painted
wood casket was to taken the altar for Mass. Burial was in the Our
Lady of Grace Cemetery in nearby Langhorne.
   Dacri didn't sit with his mother, Andrea Richardson, or
stepfather but occupied a pew alone six rows behind them. During
Mass he appeared to be sobbing.
   The Richardsons, who have custody of the Dacris' other child,
opposed their daughter-in-law's presence at the funeral. Common
Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham agreed Tuesday not to temporarily release
her from the jail where she is being held without bail. He said the
mother's presence would turn ``what ought to be a quiet and
respectful burial of an infant into a circus atmosphere.''
   The media was barred from the cemetery. Earlier, church officials
summoned a police officer after two reporters disregarded a request
to stay outside during the funeral.
   Also in church were Mrs. Dacri's parents, David and Barbara Essig
of Peckville, Pa., and her sister and brother. They sat impassively.

   Legislation to set a uniform nationwide poll
closing time during presidential elections was introduced Wednesday
by Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   The bill is intended to prevent early projections of election
results while polls on the West Coast are still open.
   Election officials in the West have complained that early network
television projections of the winner in the presidential race
discourages voters in their states from going to the polls. The
lower turnout has affected the outcome of close local races,
officials have said.
   ``After every presidential election, the need for this bill is
increasingly apparent,'' said Adams, adding that last year the
networks began their ``quadrennial scramble'' to project a winner in
the presidential race almost two hours before polls closed in the
West.
   ``As the networks struggled to beat each other to the punch, they
delivered a severe blow to our electoral process,'' said Adams.
   The bill calls for the polls to close simultaneously across the
country, at 7 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. Mountain, 9 p.m. Central and
10 p.m. Eastern. Poll closing times in Hawaii and Alaska would not
be affected.
   Similar legislation was approved by the Senate Rules Committee
last year, but was not acted on by the full Senate during the rush
to adjourn before the election.

   West German investigators are exploring leads
that the giant Siemens technology firm assisted in the construction
of a chemical plant in Libya by providing electronic control
equipment and telephone gear, a U.S. government source said
Wednesday.
   The offices of three West German companies and the homes of 12
people suspected of assisting Libya in violation of export laws were
searched Wednesday, authorities in Offenburg said. Only one of the
firms, Imhausen-Chemie, was identified by a spokesman for the
prosecutor's office.
   Siemens has denied any wrongdoing.
   The U.S. government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the control equipment apparently was shipped to Libya under an
expired license while 10 tons of telephone equipment was mislabeled
as being bound for the Hong Kong telephone exchange.
   He said some investigators believe Siemens' role in advancing the
plant project could grow larger as the probe proceeds.
   Siemens spokesman Horst Siebert said the Munich-based company had
delivered switching and measuring equipment for a project in Hong
Kong, but denied any wrongdoing or involvement with a Libyan
enterprise.
   The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said he had no
comment.
   The investigation now is centered mostly on Imhausen-Chemie and
its alleged role in constructing the plant at Rabta, some 60 miles
south of Tripoli, and also on Intec, another West German firm that
reportedly helped Libya convert transport planes into tankers to
refuel French-built jets in midair so they could reach Israel.
   The idea was to bring the Western Wall in Jerusalem, other Jewish
holy places in the capital, and Tel Aviv, the most populous city in
Israel, within range, the source said.
   Siemens and also Saltzgitter, a wholly state-owned company that
reportedly supplied plans for the plant, are getting increased
attention. Saltzgitter has denied its employees worked on the Rabta
factory.
   The West German government initially disputed findings by
separate U.S., British and Dutch investigations that linked West
German firms to the project, but subsequently acknowledged there was
compelling evidence to support the allegations.
   Officials in West Germany are conducting a criminal investigation
to determine if Imhausen-Chemie and other companies illegally
shipped arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to
produce them. The affair has deeply embarrassed the West German
government.
   A former Imhausen-Chemie manager who had buried damaging
documents is cooperating with the investigators, said the source. He
described the ex-employee as a ``canary.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has denied the plant was designed
to produce chemical weapons and has offered to open it to
international inspection. Former Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, who led the U.S. campaign to deny Libya useful technology,
said before leaving office last week that the plant had not reached
the point of production _ and might not get there if Western firms
heeded U.S. warnings.
   Gadhafi contends the plant is designed to eventually produce
pharmaceuticals.

   The Air Force launched
an unarmed Minuteman III missile Wednesday that successfully reached
its target in the Pacific Ocean 4,200 miles away, officials said.
   The missile blasted off at 5:57 a.m. and splashed down as planned
30 minutes later in the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall
Islands, said Capt. Teresa V. Waddell.
   The launch was the 473rd Strategic Air Command test launch of a
Minuteman missile from this base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The window for the launch, or the time during which the Western
Test Range is secured and cleared of sea vessels and aircraft, began
at 5 a.m. The flight was delayed 27 minutes by ``minor unexpected
events,'' said Lt. Gary Morey of the Vandenberg-based 1st Strategic
Aerospace Command Division. He would not elaborate.
   Morey said the lift off was monitored on the ground by a crew
from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where the missile was
stationed before being transferred to Vandenberg.
   The launch was the first from Vandenberg since reports surfaced
two weeks ago that the flight recorder from a similar July 1987 test
involving a Minuteman II missile may have been recovered by the
Soviet Union.
   That missile was carrying a flight recorder for the U.S.
Department of Energy, which manufactures and tests this nation's
nuclear weapons. Although that recorder contained no classified
information, it could provide valuable information to an adversary,
said Chris Sankey, Energy Department spokesman.
   However, the Minuteman III carries no flight recorder and instead
radios down information to U.S. tracking stations while it flies,
said Tech. Sgt. Alan Dockery, speaking for SAC headquarters near
Omaha, Neb.

   Iran's foreign minister is expected here
Thursday to try again with Syrian officials to stop a nine-month war
between the Shiite Moslem militias they sponsor in Lebanon.
   The Syrian-backed Amal and the fundamentalist Hezbollah,
supported by Iran, are fighting for supremacy among Lebanon's 1
million Shiites, the largest sect in the war-ravaged nation.
   More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since
April. The latest round of battles has taken 172 lives since Dec.
31, and 337 people have been reported wounded.
   A truce was announced Wednesday morning under a ``preliminary''
peace agreement, but an hour-long battle broke the truce later in
the day.
   Iran said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati would visit
Damascus on Thursday to make the deal final. He also was in the
Syrian capital Tuesday.
   Syria supported Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq, in which a
cease-fire was reached Aug. 20. But their interests compete in
Lebanon, where Syria stations about 40,000 troops and has been the
main power broker.
   Amal and Hezbollah, which means Party of God, reached the peace
agreement during three days of negotiations in Damascus mediated by
Syria and Iran.
   A Syrian Foreign Ministry statement issued Wednesday after
night-long negotiations said the rival militias agreed to end their
war in south Lebanon and the south Beirut slums, but a battle with
mortars and machine guns began later in south Lebanon.
   Police said five militiamen were wounded in the hour-long battle
in the shattered orchards of Iklim el-Tuffah, or Apple province,
which was a land of abundance before Lebanon's sectarian civil war
began in 1975.
   Several earlier Amal-Hezbollah truces also have failed.
   Elsewhere in south Lebanon, the Israeli army and allied
militiamen expelled 40 Lebanese men, women and children from its
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' just north of the border, police
reported.
   They said the expulsion from the Sunni Moslem village of Shibaa
inside the zone occurred after inhabitants refused to cooperate with
an Israeli-sponsored local administration. A police spokesman said
130 soldiers and militiamen, with 20 armored personnel carriers,
surrounded Shibaa during the night.
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said two 155mm howitzer shells landed
at the U.N. peacekeeping force headquarters in the border town of
Naqoura but did not explode.
   He told reporters they were fired from around Marjayoun,
headquarters of the South Lebanon Army, the Israeli-backed militia
that operates in the security zone.
   According to the Syrian statement, the peace agreement between
Amal and Hezbollah provided for an immediate cease-fire and an end
to hostile propaganda campaigns by both sides.
   It said the militias would continue negotiations for a
``comprehensive reconciliation agreement.''
   Syrianofficials would not comment on the cease-fire violation.
   Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, met in Damascus on
Tuesday with President Hafez Assad, Foreign Minster Farouk
al-Sharaa, Amal leader Nabih Berri and Hussein Musavi, leader of
Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Lebanon, but the more secular and nationalist Amal wants government
in which Moslems would share power equally with the once-dominant
Christians.
   Hezbollah advocates guerrilla attacks on Israel, but Amal seeks
only to get the Israelis out of the border zone. It opposes
cross-border raids because they provoke retaliation against the
predominantly Shiite population of south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Official Blames Reactor Accident on Poor Supervision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accident that caused several valves to
rupture at a nuclear reactor in South Carolina resulted in part from
poor supervision and a neglect of safety procedures, Energy
Department officials said Wednesday.
   Troy Wade, acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told
a Senate hearing the accident was disturbingly similar to an
incident last August in which operators of another reactor at the
Savannah River Plant bypassed standard procedures in attempting to
restart the reactor, causing a dangerous power surge.
   ``It does have some unfortunate parallels to the August incident
when you talk about operator attitude,'' Wade told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   Department officials at Savannah River said Wednesday it was too
early to say whether the accident Sunday would delay a planned
restart of the three-reactor complex. Savannah River is the nation's
only source of tritium, a perishable gas vital to the production of
nuclear warheads.
   The complex has produced no tritium since last spring, due to
technical and safety problems. Department officials have said they
hope to have the reactors running again by the end of 1989, although
no firm target date has been set.
   Gary Pitchford, a department spokesman at Savannah River, said
all testing, maintenance and other operations at the K reactor were
halted after the accident and would remain on hold at least for a
few more days. He said investigators would make a detailed
assessment of the damage.
   Pitchford said preliminary indications were that this shutdown of
reactor operations ``will not have any significant impact'' on the
timetable for restarting the K reactor.
   The Pentagon has said production of tritium must be resumed
before the end of the year to avoid a weakening of the nation's
nuclear weapons program. It has not said exactly when the tritium
supply would reach a critical level.
   Pitchford said it appeared it would take ``a few weeks'' to
complete the investigation of Sunday's accident.
   Department officials said the reactor operators were performing a
test involving running water through the reactor's backup cooling
system and monitoring the pressure in pipes. Operators were unaware
that a valve had been left open after a similar test last week, and
pressure did not rise to expected levels.
   In what Pitchford called a violation of standard procedures, the
operators started another pump, causing pressure inside the pipes to
rise suddenly. The valve that had been left open then slammed shut,
causing a surge of pressure that damaged other valves.
   Wade recalled that after the August incident, an extra reactor
crew was added at Savannah River so that one full complement could
always be in training. ``That hasn't helped'' improve safety
procedures ``as we thought it would,'' he said.
   He added that if the damage from Sunday's accident turns out to
be ``the worst case,'' it will have some effect on plans for
restarting the reactor.
   ``We will not restart until we are satisfied with worker training
and worker attitude,'' he said.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who has led congressional inquiries into
problems at the nuclear weapons complex, told Wade the latest
incident seemed to indicate that procedures to assure safety at
Savannah River had not improved since last summer.
   Meanwhile, governors from states with nuclear weapons plants
urged President Bush on Wednesday to commit more money to cleaning
up radioactive and chemical pollution at government-owned bomb
factories.
   ``As the governors of the states most affected, we implore you to
take the initiative in working with Congress to establish cleanup as
a national imperative,'' said a letter from Govs. Richard Celeste of
Ohio, Booth Gardner of Washington, Roy Romer of Colorado, Cecil
Andrus of Idaho, Ned Ray McWherter of Tennessee and Bob Miller of
Nevada.
   ``As an urgent critical first step in this process we urge you to
include substantially increased funding for waste cleanup and
disposal work at (Energy Department) facilities in your fiscal year
1990 budget proposal,'' said the letter, delivered to the White
House.

<HEAD>Official Says Accelerator Technology Not `Mature' Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has concluded that
linear accelerator technology is not ``mature'' enough that
accelerators rather than nuclear reactors can be used to produce a
key ingredient for atomic weapons, a top department official said
Wednesday.
   ``It is a giant step from where we are today to the kind of
accelerator and size of accelerator we would need,'' Troy Wade, the
department's acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   Scientists at the Los Alamos and Brookhaven national laboratories
and the Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washington state have written
that an accelerator could produce tritium more cheaply, quickly and
safely than a nuclear reactor.
   Some of the scientists also believe that an accelerator could be
used to change highly radioactive waste into less hazardous
substances.
   Last July, the department recommended construction of two new
nuclear reactors to produce tritium, one at the Savannah River
complex in South Carolina, and the other at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls.
   The reactors, which would cost an estimated $6.8 billion and take
at least 10 years to finish, would replace the aging
tritium-producing reactors at Savannah River. The existing Savannah
River reactors have been plagued by safety problems and are
currently shut down.
   ``We have looked at accelerator technology,'' Wade told the
committee. ``It is not mature technology. We would continue to
pursue the accelerator technology, but at the moment it is not as
mature as fission reactors.''
   The department provided $300,000 in funding for the initial
accelerator research, but no money was provided to continue the
research in the current fiscal year.
   Also on Wednesday, an aide to Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said the
senator may ask the General Accounting Office to review the
accelerator proposal.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons.
   The accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to
operate, roughly the output of an entire nuclear power plant. The
scientists who have studied the accelerator have suggested the
Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state as one possible site.
   The Pacific Northwest has the cheapest electric rates in the
nation and the Bonneville Power Administration has indicated it
would have enough electricity available in the 1990s to power an
accelerator.

<HEAD>Famed Artist Gets Surrealistic Sendoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Salvador Dali was buried on Wednesday
inside a museum filled with his surrealistic artwork next to a
shower-equipped Cadillac and a painting of a woman's torso.
   Thousands watched as four workers wearing Dali-designed uniforms
carried his coffin through the arched door of the Theater-Museum
Dali, a converted municipal theater where the artist, then 14, held
his first exhibition 71 years ago.
   Dali was eulogized earlier Wednesday in the Sant Pere Roman
Catholic parish church, then carried across a square bearing his
name to the museum he founded in the city where he was born.
   After weaving past Dali's ``Rainy Taxi'' _ a 1938 Cadillac with a
coin-operated interior shower system _ pallbearers helped lower the
black lacquered coffin into a marble-lined hole that was covered
with a light gray slab of stone.
   A giant painting of a woman's nude torso with an image on its
stomach of a gaping doorway topped by an olive tree looked down from
the wall behind the coffin.
   On one side was a white plaster group sculpture of an orchestra
and on was ``Lincoln in Dali Vision,'' a giant painting of Dali's
late wife, Gala, that turns into a portrait of Abraham Lincoln when
viewed from a distance.
   The funeral service and burial were broadcast live on Spanish
national television.
   ``Since he was an infant, he searched for beauty,'' Rev. Narciso
Costabella said of Dali. ``Salvador, now that you have found
authentic beauty in which you can revel forever, we wish you perfect
rest and peace.''
   Police said more than 20,000 people visited the Dali's Galatea
Tower residence, where his body lay in state for 31 hours.
   The painter died in Figueras on Monday, leaving an estate
estimated at $87.7 million by some accounts.
   Dali's will reportedly divides his estate among the governments
of Figueras, Catalonia and Spain. Under Spanish law, it cannot be
read until 15 days after his death.
   Funeral mourners included one of Dali's few living relatives, his
cousin Montserrat Dali, who sat in the front row along with longtime
Dali collaborators, including painter Antoni Pitxot, French
archivist and Dali's principal merchant Robert Descharnes and
attorney Miguel Domenech.
   Across the aisle sat Spanish Culture Minister Jorge Semprun,
Catalonian regional government president Jordi Pujol and Figueras
Mayor Mariano Lorca.
   The owners of the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., A.
Reynolds and Eleanor Morse and Italian collector Giuseppe Alboretto
also attended the funeral.
   His death has left a dispute over the reproduction rights to his
artwork.
   Morse, who owns the largest private Dali collection outside
Spain, said earlier he would not discuss legal issues until after
the mourning period.
   ``I'm here because of a 45-year-old friendship, to pay my
respects to a dear friend and that's all,'' he said.
   Alboretto, who owns more than 500 Dali works, said he had
prepared legal action against Decharnes, who administers Demart Pro
Arte, an Amsterdam-based company that has reproduction rights for
Dali's work through 2004.
   A founder of the surrealist movement in the 1930s, Dali was the
last of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included
Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro.
   After living in Madrid, Paris and the United States, Dali
returned for good to Catalonia in 1948.
   In later years he was known as much for his outrageous
personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings.
   He went into seclusion after his wife, manager and muse Gala died
in 1982.
   He had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a
wheelchair and fed through a tube since he suffered burns in a 1984
fire.
   Dali was admitted to Figueras Hospital on Monday because of
severe heart trouble aggravated by pneumonia. It was his third trip
to the hospital since late November.

   Nearly a quarter of the Senate sponsored
legislation Wednesday that would reject a proposed 50 percent
congressional pay raise, and would roll back the increase if the
House lets it become law by ducking a vote.
   The senators, 10 Democrats and 13 Republicans, made clear they
wanted to turn up pressure on the House, which appears headed toward
allowing the increase to become law automatically.
   Sens. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa,
chief sponsors of the legislation, said the rollback feature would
keep pressure on the House even if the raise becomes law through
House inaction.
   If the increase takes effect, Grassley said, House opponents of
the raise could try again and again to attach a rollback to crucial
legislation.
   Former President Reagan proposed increasing rank-and-file
congressional salaries from $89,500 a year to $135,000, a raise that
becomes law Feb. 8 unless both the House and Senate vote to stop it.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised a
vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline, but House leaders
have expressed no interest in allowing such a vote.
   Until now, critics of the raise have centered on stopping the
increase by the deadline.
   The Pressler-Grassley bill, and comments by lawmakers in both
houses Wednesday, have raise the possibility of action after the
deadline to reduce the raise.
   Senators joining Pressler and Grassley in sponsoring the bill are
Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.; David Boren, D-Okla.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C. and Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   Also, Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.; Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo.; Richard H.
Bryan, D-Nev.; Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Richard C. Shelby, D-Ala.
and Don Nickles, R-Okla.
   Mitchell told reporters: ``I favor a comprehensive approach that
includes enactment the ethics bill the president vetoed, campaign
finance reform, a ban on honoraria and enactment of compensation to
offset the loss in honoraria.''
   He said the package could not be pulled together before the
automatic trigger for the raise.
   The ethics bill, vetoed by Reagan and introduced again Wednesday
by Thurmond, would restrict lobbying by former members of Congress,
their staffs and top executive branch officials. Campaign finance
reform would impose limits on campaign spending.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., sponsor of the House version of the
ethics bill, said he believed the House also would address the pay
raise as part of a reform package after the increase went into
effect.
   ``There should be a vote scheduled, and I think will be this
spring,'' Frank said.
   Frank said he favors a package that includes the post-employment
ethics bill, elimination of honoraria, and a $27,000 pay raise that
would be a tradeoff for the honoraria loss in the House.
   Frank's plan, however, likely would be unpopular with senators,
who can keep $35,800 in honoraria compared with the House cap of
$26,850. Senators would therefore lose more in honoraria than they
would gain in a raise.
   The proposal emphasized the strains between the two houses in the
pay raise controversy.
   House members don't like the Senate's higher honoraria figure.
Senators are angry that the House has refused to vote on pay raises
before they automatically become law.
   Frank said many senators ``would like to leave the honoraria on''
and asked why the Pressler-Grassley bill did not include an
honoraria ban along with the pay raise rollback.
   Grassley said House members resent the higher Senate honoraria
``without a doubt'' because ``most senators get some honoraria. Most
House members don't get any.''
   The Pressler-Grassley bill is in three parts.
   The first feature would would disapprove the raise, not only for
lawmakers but also a proposed 50 percent increase for top executive
branch officials and federal judges. This action would only be
meaningful if the House followed suit.
   The second part, effective if the raise becomes law, would roll
back congressional and executive branch salaries to levels of last
Jan. 1. Judges would still get their raise because the Constitution
prohibits reducing their salaries.
   The third element would require that all future pay raises have a
recorded vote.

<HEAD>Arafat Says US Can Bring Peace, Bush Should Act Fast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat urged the Bush
administration Wednesday to move quickly in its Middle East peace
efforts and persuade Israel to take part in peace talks.
   ``We hope the new U.S. administration will contribute in
pressuring Israel to bow to the voice of peace,'' Arafat said,
appealing for worldwide backing for his peace initiative.
   Arafat wants the Palestine Liberation Organization to have equal
footing with Israel in peace negotiations, a demand Israel has
refused.
   ``The present year is important for such an American decision
after George Bush has taken over the presidency, and before
Washington is taken up with other international issues,'' he said.
   Arafat was addressing a news conference in Muscat before leaving
after a three-day visit, his first ever to Oman. He has been
enlisting the efforts of Sultan Qaboos in his quest for wide-scale
diplomatic backing for the peace initiative.
   ``Peace is not up to Israel but up to the United States. The
Israel decision lies in Washington and not in Tel Aviv,'' Arafat
said in other interviews while in Oman.
   ``The question now is whether the international community will
force Israel to respond to peace or not,'' Arafat said. ``Will the
world leave the powder keg in the Middle East aflame because of
Israeli intransigeance?''
   More than 360 Palestinians have died in the 13-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Fifteen
Israelis have also been killed.
   Arafat renewed a proposal to place the occupied territories under
U.N. trusteeship for ``a transitional period of a few months''
during which the Palestinian inhabitants would exercise their right
to self-determination.
   In Palestinian language this means a referendum in which these
inhabitants would decide whether to be an independent state, or to
confederate with Jordan.
   Bush, in a pre-inauguration interview, recommended confederation
as the basis for a Palestinian settlement.
   The Bush administration is about to resume formal sessions of the
dialogue with the PLO that the Reagan administration initiated in
December after Arafat explicitly recognized Israel and renounced
terrorism.
   Abu Dhabi's state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad referred to an
informal meeting in Tunis on Monday between PLO Executive Committee
member Farouk Kaddoumi and U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr.
   It said Kaddoumi pressed for Washington to reopen the PLO
information office in the American capital, closed after
congressional charges of terrorism by the guerrilla organization.
   Mahmoud Abbas, a PLO executive committee member, said the
movement will insist that Washington clearly define what it
considers Palestinian rights when PLO-U.S. talks resume.
   ``So far, we have had only one meeting with the Americans with
only one topic in the agenda, terrorism. We have not discussed
anything related to Palestinian leaders or institutions,'' he said
in a lecture Tuesday night in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
   Abbas also scotched reports the United States demanded the PLO
disband guerrilla groups and expel PLO figures Washington considers
terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators said they cannot
determine whether politics was behind private detectives who
shadowed Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in 1986 and have closed the
books on the case, according to documents released Wednesday.
   The Federal Election Commission's general counsel said it can't
sort out whether the detectives were hired to influence the 1986
election or were only looking into the lobbying activities of
Dorgan's wife, Kimberly, who represented Canadian timber interests.
   Dorgan alleged that the detectives were trying to dig up
information for a Washington lawyer, Bert Rand, who is a friend of
former Sen. Mark Andrews, R-N.D. At the time, Andrews viewed Dorgan
as a potential rival in his race for re-election to the Senate.
   Dorgan said he was disappointed but not surprised at the
commission's decision to drop the case.
   ``Even a blind hog can find an acorn now and then, but the FEC
has been consistently unwilling to investigate these things,''
Dorgan said. ``The Federal Election Commission is a political body
which seems to have a political antenna in these cases which is
always out.''
   Andrews, who denied any involvement in the matter, said the
commission's decision was a vindication, although he acknowledged
that political fallout from the incident probably contributed to his
losing the election.
   ``The original complaint against our campaign committee was
politically motivated and totally without substance,'' Andrews said.
   That complaint was filed one week before the 1986 election by
Dorgan and Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who went on to win a narrow
victory over Andrews.
   The complaint originally was against Andrews' re-election
committee, the state Republican Party, the private detective agency
and a handful of lawyers.
   The commission decided to drop the investigation last fall, but
that decision and the case record remained sealed until Wednesday.
However, the central issue remained unresolved.
   ``There is conflicting evidence as to whether the activity in
question was undertaken for the purpose of influencing a federal
election,'' the commission's general counsel wrote.
   Rand, who told the commission he was working on behalf of Wendell
Wyatt, a former Republican congressman from Oregon, hired two other
lawyers, one of whom hired a Bismarck, N.D., private detective
agency to gather information on Dorgan.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Wednesday it had begun legal
proceedings to suspend a top contracting official who has been
implicated in the Pentagon fraud investigation.
   The service said Dr. Victor D. Cohen, the deputy for tactical
systems in the office of the assistant secretary for acquisition,
had been served on Tuesday with a ``Notice of Proposed Indefinite
Suspension.''
   Cohen has seven days to contest the Air Force personnel action.
   ``This action is based primarily on an FBI affidavit which became
available to the Air Force on Dec. 28,'' the service said in a
prepared statement.
   ``The action is based on a reasonable cause to believe that he
has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be
imposed.''
   If an indefinite suspension is imposed, Cohen would be forced
into a non-pay status ``for an indefinite period of time, penking
resolution of the criminal process.''
   Cohen is currently suspended from his job but is drawing pay.
   Cohen, unlike one Navy employee who was suspended earlier this
month, has not been indicted by the federal grand jury that is
conducting the investigation.
   Cohen was named in a government affadavit filed by prosecutors
investigating bribery and corruption in the Pentagon's
$150-billion-a-year procurement business.
   The affadavit, based on telephone taps, showed by Cohen used his
official position to help consultant William Galvin or his clients
in exchange for payments and other gratuities. Galvin has been
indicted by a federal grand jury in the Pentagon case.
   The affadavit that names Cohen cites an example of Cubic Corp.,
of San Diego, a client of Galvin's and a maker of shells that house
electronic gear, called pods.
   Sometime before April 1, Galvin asked Cohen to award an
unidentified pod contract to Cubic on a sole source basis so that
Cubic would be the only supplied, the ducment said.
   In a tapped phone conversation on May 15, 1987, Cohen told Galvin
that he wouldn't award the contract to Cubic as a sole source. But
he said he planned to have the Air Force issue the request for
proposal with a required delivery scheduled that Cubic's competitor
couldn't meet, the affidavit says.
   ``Cohen assured Galvin that by doing it this way, the procurement
would appear to have been completed when, in actuality, Cubic would
be guaranteed the award of the contract,'' the document said.

<TEXT>
   A 9-inch statuette of the Virgin Mary that a
police official put on his desk sparked a dispute with his deskmate
that has spiraled into a debate on the division between church and
state, authorities said Wednesday.
   The small-scale religious war erupted last year between Lt.
Eugene V. Begley and his supervisor, Capt. Bruce Hogan, when Hogan
placed the pale yellow plastic Madonna on their desk.
   The officers, who were commander and second-in-command on the
evening shift, began trading insults and jibes as the argument
escalated last fall.
   Hogan alleged that Begley shrouded the religious icon in
newspaper whenever Hogan stepped out for a meal, and ordered him
never to touch the statue.
   ``I never touched it,'' responded Begley. ``I just put the cup
over it.''
   The spat came to an abrupt conclusion in November when Chief John
F. Hollow transferred Begley to dayside detective duties. Hollow has
said the transfer had nothing to do with the religious dispute.
   On Tuesday, a state arbitrator heard Begley's claim that the
transfer, which he says will cost him thousands of dollars a year,
was indeed religiously motivated and was improper. Three more
hearings are scheduled through March.
   Lynn, a factory city of about 78,000, has seven Roman Catholic
churches and a police force of 180 officers.
   ``I'm as good a Roman Catholic as anybody, but that statue has no
place on a police captain's desk,'' Begley said. ``We have
Catholics, Protestants, Jews and I'm sure a few Moslems in this
department. Hogan has no right to push his religion on other people.
He should not be flaunting it.''
   Calls to Hogan's office Wednesday evening were an answered by an
officer who said that department employees had been ordered not to
discuss the case with the news media.
   David Hoffman, an attorney for the Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts, said the group had not been asked to become involved
in Begley's case but said it raised important issues.
   ``(We) are often concerned when government officials in a
position of authority use displays of religious objects in a way
that might suggest to the public or to employees that there is a
particular religion that is favored by the agency,'' Hoffman said.
   ``Such a symbolic link between church and state raises issues
under the establishment clause of the First Amendment.''
   Begley claims the transfer cost him $45,000 in annual pay because
by working days he can no longer accept extra assignments for
traffic control on road construction projects.
   Department officials had little comment on the case Wednesday.
   ``It should never have left the in-house stage,'' said Lt. Joseph
Rowe, Hollow's spokesman. ``The department certainly didn't plan to
go public with it.''

   Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia on Wednesday
rejected proposals for an international peacekeeping force in his
country and asked other nations to stop supporting guerrillas
seeking to topple his government.
   Cambodian guerrillas, meanwhile, demanded that Vietnam come up
with a timetable for withdrawing its occupation forces from the
country.
   Hun Sen had a ``frank discussion'' with Thai Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan and other Thai leaders on Wednesday, said Thai
government spokesman Suvit Yodmani.
   Yodmani stressed the two-hour talk did not constitute Thai
recognition of the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia.
   Chatichai ``just wants to get to know Hun Sen because Hun Sen
later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government,
hopefully when there is peace'' in Cambodia, Suvit told reporters.
   He said both sides agreed that all warring Cambodian factions
must attend the second session of Cambodian peace talks scheduled
Feb. 19-21 in Indonesia.
   Participants in the first session in July included Vietnam, Laos,
the warring parties in Cambodia and the members of the non-communist
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   ``The conclusion is that up to now, anyway, (Cambodia) would like
Thailand to try to get the four sides together and to face one
another and talk frankly,'' said Suvit, referring to Hun Sen's
government and the three parties in the Cambodian resistance
coalition.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and toppled the brutal regime of
the Khmer Rouge, who killed hundreds of thousands of people during
their three-year rule.
   Thailand has shunned the Phnom Penh government since then and has
backed the three-party guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese and
Cambodian government troops.
   Before meeting with Chatichai, Hun Sen told reporters that he
rjected an international peacekeeping force for Cambodia and also
opposed other parts of the peace proposal by guerrilla coalition
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Hun Sen also reiterated calls for a cessation of all military aid
to Cambodian resistance groups opposed to his government.
   He said Sihanouk's proposals would lead to the return to power of
the Khmer Rouge, one of the parties in the guerrilla coalition.
   Hun Sen also said he was ready to discuss with the United States
the question of Americans missing in action in Cambodia from the
Vietnam war, saying the discussions could take place in Bangkok.
   The United States, which lists 83 Americans as missing in action
in Cambodia, also does not recognize the Hun Sen government.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw by 1990 but said it may pull
its forces from Cambodia by September if a political solution can be
achieved.
   In Beijing, China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Cambodian
guerrillas as demanding a specific timetable for a Vietnamese
withdrawal.
   Xinhua quoted the guerrillas' Radio Democratic Kampuchea as
saying Vietnam's withdrawal should take place under international
supervision.
   The guerrillas' main international sponsor, China, has made a
similar demand. East European sources said a timetable was discussed
during meetings last week in Beijing between Vietnamese Vice Foreign
Minister Dinh Nho Liem and Chinese officials.
   Vietnam's embassy in Beijing later said the two sides reached
some agreements, but did not say if those included an agreement on a
timetable. China earlier called Vietnam's statement that it could
pull out by September ``a step forward.''

   To bystanders, it looked as if the
contestants were trying to fish from the third-floor balcony of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday.
   In fact, the students and teachers were competing in an
experiment that could alter how spacecraft dock in outer space.
   The competition's long-range goal was to devise a cheaper, more
effective method of linking the space shuttle with the space
station. Present space shuttle docking plans are expensive and
time-consuming, said MIT Professor Andreas H. von Flotow.
   The simulated design contest was sponsored by von Flotow and
Energy Sciences Laboratory Inc. of San Diego. The $500 first prize
and a possible job with the company was offered to the competitor
who completed the docking maneuver in the shortest time.
   The experiment involved dropping a tether line from a third-floor
balcony in the MIT lobby, or the ``space station,'' and trying to
connect it with the ``space shuttle'' on the floor below, fashioned
from a garbage can and contestant-made nose cones.
   The trick was linking the tether to the space shuttle as rapidly
as possible without risking hard impact. But the link had to be
strong enough to lift the simulated space station off the floor.
   ``This idea has been drifting around for years,'' said von
Flotow, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at
MIT. ``But the aerospace business is the most conservative around.
They don't always want to try new things, even if there are
considerable benefits.''
   Von Flotow said several aerospace companies had expressed
interest in seeing the winning design.
   Currently, the plans for a shuttle-space station docking call for
what is termed metal-to-metal mating, which requires hours of
precision flying to dock a relatively small payload.
   Since the cost of docking is estimated to be about $100,000 per
second, substantial savings can result from finding a faster
procedure, von Flotow said.
   Von Flotow said docking would require less fuel if a soft device
on a miles-long tether were dropped from the orbiting space station
to dock remotely with the space shuttle's payload at a sub-orbital
altitude.
   He said several of the designs attempted Wednesday could work in
space, where tether lines would be required to lift 6,600 pounds of
weight.
   Four teams of contestants competed in the two-hour experiment.
The winner, MIT graduate student Siegfried Zerweckh, used a fishnet
attached to the tether line to grasp a nose cone made of foam
rubber. His best time was 9.9 seconds.
   MIT Professor Norman Ham, the only faculty member to compete,
lowered two balloons and hooked them to cylindrical wires attached
to the nose cone in a 19-second docking maneuver.
   To ensure that the simulated docking mechanisms would not damage
a space shuttle, von Flotow tested each of the entries by dropping
them on an egg and making sure they did not break it.
   ``It's something you can create and develop and at the same time
it may prove really useful some day,'' said Gary Carr, a U.S.
Department of Transportation mechanical engineer who was on the only
non-MIT participant in the contest.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 11 grafs new to update with Dole, Darman votes, CORRECT
vote on Baker roll call to reflect change in official Senate tally; picks

   The Senate unanimously confirmed James A. Baker
III as secretary of state Wednesday as Majority Leader George
Mitchell pledged to cooperate with the Bush administration while
pursuing a Democratic agenda of improvements in the minimum wage,
housing, health care and the environment.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate also confirmed Elizabeth Dole as
Labor Secretary and Richard Darman as Budget Director without a
dissenting vote.
   Mitchell, in a speech that seemed crafted as a response to
President Bush's inaugural address, said he looked forward to ``true
bipartisanship'' on foreign policy. He said that meant the White
House must commit itself to ``full, timely and meaningful
consultation'' with Congress.
   The first votes were anything but contentious.
   The roll call was 99-0 to confirm Baker, who served as Treasury
Secretary and White House chief of staff under President Reagan and
was President Bush's campaign manager last year. He was sworn into
office minutes later, the State Department said.
   Mrs. Dole, the wife of Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole, also won
approval on a 99-0 vote. She is a former Secretary of Transportation
who resigned her post to help her husband's unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign.
   Darman's confirmation roll call was 99-0, as well. He is a former
top aide to Baker at the Treasury and will be Bush's point man in
the drive to reduce the federal deficit.
   In all three instances, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla, was the only
senator who didn't vote.
   In the busiest day so far of the new, 101st Congress, committees
also held confirmation hearings for several Cabinet appointees.
Among them was Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, who said
``there is a need for reform'' at the Pentagon and pledged to work
with Congress to achieve it.
   Nearly a quarter of the Senate sponsored legislation to block the
$45,000 proposed congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect on
Feb. 8. The proposal would roll back the increase if, as expected,
the House lets it become law without a vote.
   The Bush administration worked behind the scenes to defuse
controversy over one Cabinet appointment.
   Louis Sullivan, named to head the Department of Health and Human
Services, met privately with anti-abortion senators and apparently
persuaded them he is committed enough to their cause to win their
support for confirmation.
   ``Dr. Sullivan believes in his heart that the Roe vs. Wade
decision should be overturned,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
referring to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
Sullivan had upset many conservative senators when he was quoted by
another senator as saying he did not favor overturning the ruling.
   Baker, Dole and Darman were the first Bush appointees to face
confirmation votes in the Senate. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Education Secretary Laurio
Cavazos are holdover appointments from the Reagan administration and
did not require confirmation.
   The House was not in session, but inside the Senate chamber,
speeches by Mitchell and Republican leader Bob Dole were followed by
the introduction of legislation for the first time this year.
   The bills ranged from a measure to block the proposed $45,000 pay
raise for lawmakers _ or repeal it if it takes effect on Feb. 7 _ to
Dole's proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitition.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., filed legislation to raise the
minimum wage gradually from $3.35 to $4.55 an hour and Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., filed ethics legislation that was approved last
year but vetoed by President Reagan.
   Dole, who spoke a few moments after Mitchell, pledged
bipartisanship and added it was the intention of the Republicans to
``support and further the cause of our new Republican president.''
   Mitchell, in a speech that seemed drafted to reply to Bush's
inaugural address of last week, said the president had ``put his
hand out to me and the speaker of the house. I now extend mine to
him.''
   Mitchell said, ``We enter a new era. The New Deal and the Reagan
reaction to it are over. We face new circumstances.''
   He said his objectives were to reestablish a bipartisan foreign
policy while also establishing a new social contract at home ``that
defines not only what our country will do for our citizens but what
our citizens will do for our country.''
   The Maine Democrat cautioned Bush that bipartisanship on foreign
policy required ``full, timely, and meaningful consultation with
Congress'' on the part of the new administration.
   Mitchell added that serious consultation ``will not prevent
differences between the Congress and the president. There have
always been such differences,. There always will be.''
   His speech carried slightly more of a challenge to Bush on
domestic issues.
   ``We look forward to receiving the president's budget
proposals,'' he said, adding that Democrats would work with Bush
``to achieve a bipartisan budget reduction'' that is ``fair,
credible and based on realistic economic projections.''
   Mitchell said his speech was not designed as a detailed agenda
for the year, but he did go into some detail. He said Democrats
would seek legislation to deal with the homeless, health care and
increased research and development. He called for full funding for a
drug bill approved a year ago, improvements in the Clean Air Act and
said, ``We will raise the minimum wage to a rate that will help
those who depend on it.''
   He also said he favors legislation to establish a program of
voluntary national service.
   Mitchell pledged to seek enactment of a comprehensive package of
ethics legislation, including laws restricting lobbying activities
of former members of Congress, a campaign finance bill and a ban on
speaking and appearance fees received by senators and
representatives.
   He did not say so in his speech, but he told reporters beforehand
he favors a pay raise for members of Congress as part of the ethics
package.
   The proposed $45,000 pay raise has become the most controversial
issue of the new Congress, and opponents introduced legislation
during the day to block it, or, in the event it takes effect, to
repeal it. Their measure is designed to thwart apparent plans by
House Speaker Jim Wright to prevent a vote on the pay raise until it
takes effect automatically in two weeks.
   Lawmakers' salaries are to rise from just over $89,000 to
$135,000, an increase of 50 percent. Federal judges and some
political appointees would also receive increases.

   President Bush voiced reservations Wednesday
about American participation in a human rights conference in Moscow
in 1991, saying ``we need to look for peformance'' by the Soviet
Union. In his first interview as president, Bush also hinted he will
stop in China after visiting Japan next month.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Bush said, discussing the possibility of going to
Beijing. ``We may have something on that'' soon, he added. Later, as
he left the Oval Office for the night, Bush was asked again if he
was going to China. ``No, just going home,'' he quippped.
   In the interview, the president also said he hoped the Federal
Reserve would not ``move so strongly against fear of inflation that
we impede growth.'' Pointing to rising prices on Wall Street, Bush
said, ``There's no signals out there in the markets that this
economy is in real trouble.''
   Bush refused to say how long his pledge against raising taxes
would apply. ``I'm not thinking beyond anything other than to say I
will not raise taxes and I've got to stay with that approach. ... I
really feel strong on that particular point, and I haven't thought
beyond one year ... or anything of that nature.''
   Bush discussed domestic and foreign policy subjects in a
12-minute interview with The New York Times and The Houston Post,
and a text of his comments was released to the press. It was the
first episode in what White House officials say will be a series of
experiments to make Bush available to the media in various forums.
   Bush's remarks about the human rights conference in Moscow echoed
reservations voiced by James A. Baker III during his confirmation
hearings to be secretary of state. In the final days of the Reagan
administration, the United States agreed to the staging of a human
rights conference in Moscow.
   Asked about going ahead with the conference, Bush said, ``I think
that we need to look for performance (on human rights), and there
will be time in which to see performance in that regard. ... There
has been definite improvement in some ways there.
   ``But let's see what develops as we move towards that conference
date,'' he said.
   Later, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States was not backing away from its commitment.
   He said ``the Bush administration is only two days old and they
want time to make our own analysis. ...
   ``But President Bush certainly agrees with President Reagan _ he
was a part of that administration _ that considerable progress on
human rights has been made in the Soviet Union after President
Gorbachev'' came to power, Fitzwater said. ``But that's not to say
there isn't room for new analysis.''
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _The administration is considering imposing a fee on customers of
savings and loan institutions to help the federal government rescue
the troubled S&amp;L industry. ``I'm not going to say what I'm going to
do but that is one option,'' he said.
   _He is not considering dropping Dr. Louis W. Sullivan as his
candidate to head the Department of Health and Human Services
despite questions about Sullivan's position on abortion. Bush said
that in his conversations with Sullivan, ``he has supported my
position 100 percent.''
   _He favors ``prudent development'' by oil companies in a vast
Arctic national wildlife refuge that environmentalists are trying to
protect.
   _He is not trying to do things differently than Reagan ``but it's
important to me to do it my way.''
   _It is uncertain how much money will be available for the war
against illegal drugs but that ``the elimination of drugs is going
to stem from vigorous changes in our society's approach to
narcotics. It's going to be successful only if our education is
successful.''
   In what will be his first foreign trip, Bush is is scheduled to
go to Ottawa on Feb. 10 to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   Bush also has said he will attend the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor
Hirohito in Japan, and there had been speculation he would go on to
China and perhaps South Korea afterward.

<HEAD>House Public Works Subcommittee Chairmen Trading Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Glenn Anderson, chairman of the House
Public Works Committee, is giving up the chairmanship of the panel's
surface transportation subcommittee after his colleagues objected to
his retaining both posts, Capitol Hill sources said Wednesday.
   As a result, a three-way swap of subcommittee chairmanships has
been worked out by lawmakers in which Anderson, D-Calif., would take
charge of the committee's weaker and less visible investigations and
oversight subcommittee.
   Rep. James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., who has chaired the
investigations panel, would instead head the committee's aviation
subcommittee. And Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., the current aviation
chairman, would chair surface transportation.
   Anderson, 75, became chairman after his predecessor, Rep. James
Howard, D-N.J., died after a heart attack last March. He has
remained relatively obscure in Congress despite a 20-year House
career, in contrast to the more colorful and outgoing Howard.
   According to three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Anderson wanted to continue as chairman of the full committee and
the surface subcommittee. But other panel members, citing a
long-standing committee tradition, argued that the committee
chairman should not also chair a subcommittee.
   The lawmakers' objections also reflected unhappiness by some of
the panel's younger members that subcommittee chairmanships are not
opening up for new people, the sources said.
   Anderson finally agreed to give up the surface panel, which
controls billions of dollars in highway and mass transit projects
and is the most sought-after subcommittee, in exchange for the
investigations chairmanship. The investigations subcommittee does
not initiate legislation, but it does conduct inquiries into various
subjects.
   The swaps are all subject to approval by the committee's 31
Democrats, who will vote on the jobs on Feb. 1.
   Mineta issued a statement Wednesday saying he would seek the
surface transportation job. Committee spokesman David Smallen, asked
about the three-way swap, said, ``I have no comment on that.''

<HEAD>Mudslide, With a Roar Like Thunder, Obliterates Tadzhik Villages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Quake, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SHARORA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It moved as fast as a running man, and
with enormous force. Looming black against the predawn sky, the
mudslide sounded like thunder, or rocks being crushed into dust,
survivors recall.
   Unleashed by an earthquake, the moving wall of mud, 50 feet high
in places, crashed down on this hillside peasant settlement in
Soviet Tadzhikistan on Monday. It buried one-story mud-brick and
prefabricated concrete homes and killed 207 villagers, most of them
in their sleep.
   It left a silent, moonlike landscape of rolling, moist earth and
no signs of life, except for white roofs that peeked through the
grime or scraps of brightly colored cloth carried across it by a
morning breeze from the hills.
   In house No. 1 at Sharora's dairy farm, herdsman Saifulo
Khodzharayev, 30, and seven members of his family were buried alive
and suffocated after the earthquake, measuring 5.4 on the Richter
scale, dislodged the earth softened by thawing snow. They were among
about 270 confirmed dead.
   The family's lone survivor was Khodzharayev's 6-day-old baby
girl, who had not yet been given a name. She was held by her father
aloft at arm's length, and escaped the deadly torrent of wet, sticky
clay, said Kholmurod Barotov, 17, a bakery worker.
   Barotov said his mother, the infant's aunt, had gone to spend the
night at her house farther up the hill to help her sister take care
of the newborn.
   That gesture probably cost Safarmo Barotov her life. Her teen-age
son survived because he had been hospitalized outside of Sharora for
a stomach ailment, he told Moscow-based reporters brought in by bus
and helicopter Wednesday to view the disaster scene.
   For this more than 300-year-old settlement, the end came in
seconds. The mudslide covered much of Sharora with a 300-yard-wide
chocolate-colored earthen slather.
   ``It was like a bomb had exploded on top of our heads, or a
thunderstorm had broke'' said Kibo Rakhikov, 27, a policeman. Roused
by the quake, he made it into the street in time to see an inky
black mass tumbling down onto the village from the hills above.
   Two days after the disaster in this remote rural area about 1,800
miles southeast of Moscow, bulldozers, cranes and dumptrucks worked
to free Sharora's streets of crumbled brick, broken pieces of
undulated roofing, twisted trees and mud.
   A group of five women, dressed in the flowing robes and shawls
common to this area north of Afghanistan and China, shuffled weeping
past wrecked and ruined homes, holding tightly to each other.
   Since custom in this mostly Moslem republic is not to attempt to
recover the bodies of people buried alive, this village, whose name
means ``spark'' in the Tadzhik language, will be fenced off and
turned into a common grave, complete with a memorial for those who
died.
   Two families, however, have insisted on searching for the bodies
of loved ones, regional Communist Party chief Khusayin Kasymov said,
and a dozen policeman and villagers, wielding shovels and hoes and
assisted by an excavator, cut into the dense earth Wednesday morning
in search of more dead.
   On the lip of the crater overlooking the site, Khusnia Khiromov,
shawled in black and weeping, watched the men slowly work down
through the mud to the shambles of the house where 11 people, six of
them her relatives, had been buried.
   Another relation, a middle-age man who covered his face with a
handkerchief, wailed loudly as he stood behind the digging men.
   In the mass of drying mud, the diggers sighted a sofa cushion
covered with a striped blanket and some hair, which they took for
the sign of a body. They unfurled a bright pink bath towel, making
ready to cover yet another victim. In Tadzhikistan, it is not
considered proper to reveal the dead to strangers.
   South of Sharora, on the other side of the rolling Urtabuz hills,
mud ran like coffee-colored lava and fouled 370 acres of land tilled
by the Karl Marx Collective Farm.
   In the farm's settlement of Okuli-Poyen, two miles down the other
side of the hill, villagers were awakened Monday by an approaching
roar that Esnali Matkamilov, 66, a retired mechanic, said sounded
like a rock-crushing machine.
   The surging, advancing mud moved more slowly, taking at least 1{
hours to reach the village. It felled trees and 32 homes in its path
but gave time enough to evaculate Okuli-Poyen, and not a single
resident died.
   ``At the sound, I jumped into my shorts, ran out of the house and
then to the next village,'' Matkamilov said. Other villagers said
they fled with their families in trucks and cars.
   In Okuli-Bolo, a village to the west of Sharora and near the
quake's epicenter, 67 people died when all 88 whitewashed dwellings
in the settlement were flattened by the quake. Many were built only
of dried clay and straw, and they crumbled into bits.

<TEXT>
   A former chairman of the House Ethics Committee
has blasted as ``jury tampering'' the attempts by two conservative
groups to lobby a GOP member of the ethics panel in the case of
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``The brazen effort is closely akin to jury tampering in a court
of law,'' said Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, in a letter to House
colleagues. ``This clearly amounts to a flagrant politicization of a
process that was specifically created to be above partisan
politics.''
   The letter was evidence of growing partisan tensions as the
Ethics Committee nears the end of its seven-month probe of Wright
and the time when its 12 members _ six Democrats and six Republicans
_ must vote on the speaker's guilt or innocence.
   Wright is accused in a six-count resolution of abusing his office
for financial gain and improperly intervening with federal
regulators on behalf of constituents.
   The controversy began last month when a conservative newsletter
published a brief bit of speculation that the ethics panel would
ultimately avoid a 6-6 tie vote on the Wright case because committee
member Rep. Chip Pashayan, R-Calif., would side with the Democrats
to exonerate the speaker.
   In response, two groups _ the Conservative Campaign Fund and the
National Right to Work Committee _ launched an effort to lobby
Pashayan to be tough on Wright.
   Peter Flaherty, director of the Conservative Campaign Fund, said
he already had doubts about the independence of the investigation of
Wright by outside counsel Richard J. Phelan. After the newsletter
item appeared, his group sent 300 pieces of mail to contributors in
Pashayan's district urging them to contact their congressman and
urge him not to side with the Democrats.
   ``There is enough information on the public record to require
strong action'' against Wright, the group's letter argues. ``All of
the members of the committee are under pressure, both subtle and
overt,'' from the speaker, it states.
   At about the same time, the right-to-work group mailed letters to
1,500 of its supporters in Pashayan's district asking that the
lawmaker ``stand up to ... the awesome power of Speaker Wright.''
   Pashayan has received about 100 calls and letters from
constituents on the issue, but the flow of contacts has dwindled
this week, and the ethics panel member professed to be
``impervious'' to the lobbying effort. But he acknowledged that
tension over the Wright case has grown as it nears its conclusion.
   Phelan is in the process of drafting his final report, consulting
occasionally with committee members, and is expected to be ready to
present it to the panel for discussion and a vote sometime in
February.
   ``As the former chairman of that committee, I feel certain that
nothing of this kind has ever previously intruded in such a way upon
the committee's deliberations,'' Stokes wrote in his letter to all
House members.
   ``Republican members of the committee, the speaker himself, and
the House as an institution deserve far better than this shabby
attempt to undermine the integrity of our processes,'' Stokes wrote.
   Efforts to contract spokesmen for the groups for a response to
Stokes' letter were unsuccessful.

   A city councilman's offer to buy semiautomatic
weapons back from people in the wake of the Stockton schoolyard
massacre led citizens to turn over an Uzi and an AK-47 to police,
officials said Wednesday.
   Councilman Nate Holden, a mayoral candidate, displayed the black
Uzi rifle at a news conference where police Cmdr. William Booth
outlined procedures for safely bringing weapons to police stations.
   Holden offered on Tuesday to pay up to $300 for semiautomatic
rifles and that night received a response, he said. A woman who kept
the Uzi under her bed for several years turned it in to ``get it out
of her life,'' he said.
   A 16-year-old boy brought the unloaded AK-47 to a police station
Wednesday, saying he received it as a gift and ``just wanted to be
rid of it,'' said spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon.
   An AK-47 was used last week by 24-year-old drifter Patrick Purdy
to fire more than 100 bullets into a schoolyard in the San Joaquin
Valley city of Stockton, killing five students, wounding 29 students
and one adult.
   The attack by Purdy, who killed himself, produced calls from
state and local officials for bans or restrictions on military-style
assault rifles, which can be bought in California more easily than
handguns.
   Booth said others who want to take Holden up on his offer to buy
the guns should take them to a police station, notifying the station
in advance and carefully storing the gun in the trunk of the car,
empty of bullets and disassembled.
   ``These weapons were manufactured to kill people. ... That kind
of weapon has no place in a civil society,'' Booth said.
   Police will issue a receipt the person can take to Holden's
office. Holden, who is running for re-election in April, said he
would pay up to $300 for each gun, depending on its value, and had
$50,000 in a campaign committee fund for the effort.
   Police said that any weapons turned in would be investigated, and
noted that possession of a gun that had been converted into a fully
automatic weapon is illegal. But Holden said parents, friends and
relatives of gun owners, particularly gang members, should welcome
the chance to get rid of the powerful and deadly weapons.
   The weapon displayed by Holden and Booth came in a canvas gun bag
with a document that identified it as an Uzi Model B, and produced
by Israel Military Industries.
   A resolution calling for legislation to ban the sale of military
assault rifles in California was approved by the county Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday. The action was spurred by the Jan. 17
shooting deaths of five children in a schoolyard in Stockton, in
northern California. Twenty-nine other students and one teacher were
wounded. The gunman then killed himself.
   ``It's important that we send a message to Sacramento that people
here are concerned about this,'' Ed Edelman, chairman of the
five-member board, said Tuesday.
   Sheriff Sherman Block told the supervisors that he was meeting
with other law enforcement officials Friday to draft legislation
banning future sales of the AK-47 assault rifle and other
military-style weapons.
   The proposed bill also would include a provision allowing judges
to increase a sentence by five years for felons convicted of using
such weapons in a crime.
   In addition to Block's suggestions, Los Angeles City Police Chief
Daryl Gates wants to require a 15-day waiting period to buy any gun
to allow law enforcement officials to check the buyer's record, a
police spokesman said.

<HEAD>Walesa to Meet with Authorities About Solidarity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa will hold
preliminary meetings with government officials Thursday about making
the independent union legal again, an adviser reported.
   In the streets of Warsaw, police detained 15 people at protests
Wednesday in support of Czechoslovak dissidents and a Polish peace
activist who was given a suspended sentence for resisting military
service, an opposition spokeswoman said.
   Thursday's official meetings in Warsaw will be the fourth since
August attended by Walesa, who founded Solidarity in 1980 as the
Soviet bloc's first free trade union.
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski of St. Brygida's, the Roman Catholic
church in Gdansk that has become Solidarity's spiritual home, said
Wednesday that Walesa would meet with government officials, but he
would not identify them. The Solidarity founder lives in Gdansk and
works as a shipyard electrician.
   Solidarity leaders agreed on Sunday to negotiate with the
government about legalizing the union, which was suppressed and
outlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's government offered during strikes last
August to meet with the opposition about economic and political
reform, but Walesa refused to negotiate without an official decision
to legalize Solidarity.
   In a reversal of policy last week, the Communist Party Central
Committee offered to allow more than one legal trade union and
participation by the opposition in government bodies.
   Walesa had planned to address an officially approved rally
Thursday at Warsaw University and hold a news conference in the
capital, but aides said both had been canceled.
   Jan Tomasiewicz of Warsaw, a student arrested in mid-December,
was the peace activist for whom Wednesday's protest was held. A
court sentenced him Wednesday to two years in prison but suspended
it for a three-year probationary period, said Bogumila Tyszkiewicz
of the outlawed Polish Socialist Party.
   She said about 40 supporters tried to attend the trial but about
half were barred from the courtroom and Jozef Pinior, a Solidarity
leader in Wroclaw, was detained briefly.
   Pinior also was among about 15 people detained after a scuffle
outside the Czechoslovak Embassy, where 30 protesters went after the
trial to raise banners saying ``Down with Communist dictators'' and
collect signatures for political prisoners in Czechoslovakia, Ms.
Tyszkiewicz said.
   Police used clubs and a chemical spray to subdue protesters and
took those arrested to vans, she reported.
   Ms. Tyszkiewicz said 10 members of the Polish Socialist Party,
Fighting Solidarity and the peace group Freedom and Peace were
detained in Katowice, southern Poland.
   She said two of them climbed onto a bus shelter in the market
square with a banner demanding Jaruzelski's removal, three threw
leaflets from a supermarket roof and five made speeches.

<TEXT>
   The former armed forces chief who
founded the Nicaraguan rebel movement in Honduras was assassinated
on Wednesday by six men who riddled his car with gunfire, officials
said.
   Former Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez died of gunshot wounds near
his home in the capital's Florencia district, said Salvador Lobo,
director of emergencies at the State Hospital School.
   Radio America, a local station, said anonymous callers claimed
responsibility on behalf of the Popular Liberation Forces, a leftist
group, but police said they had no evidence to confirm the claim.
   It was the third assassination in Honduras in the last three
weeks. The previous killings involved a Nicaraguan rebel commander
and a reputed druglord's lawyer.
   As head of the national police in 1981, Alvarez became the
godfather of the Contras by telling CIA director William Casey that
anti-Sandinista forces could operate from Honduran territory.
   In subsequent years, until his ouster by fellow officers annoyed
at his high-handedness, the passionate anti-communist continued to
develop and promote the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan guerrillas, which
became known as Contras.
   Witnesses said six gunmen waited for Alvarez outside his home and
poured machine-gun fire into his car. The driver also was killed and
Alvarez's son-in-law was wounded, police said.
   Police and army troops were deployed to look for the gunmen, said
Col. Julio Cesar Chavez, the police chief. Military personnel
searched cars at barricades set up on roads out of Tegucigalpa.
   One witness, Alba Luz Guzman, told The Associated Press the men
``intercepted me, forced me to get out of my car, then fled in my
automobile.''
   Alvarez, 56, was chief of the armed forces from 1982 to 1984
under the government of President Roberto Suazo Cordova. Trained in
the United States and Argentina, he was once considered the most
powerful figure in Honduras.
   Alvarez frequently denounced the leftist Sandinista government of
neighboring Nicaragua. He also presided over the beginning of joint
U.S.-Honduran military exercises in Honduras designed to intimidate
the Sandinistas.
   The Contras, Alvarez once pledged, would ``wage a war without
quarter against international communism, which has now taken over
Nicaragua.''
   Under his original proposal to Casey, described in the book
``Banana Diplomacy'' by Newsday correspondent Roy Gutman, Alvarez
proposed to use the rebels to provoke a border incident with the
leftist Sandinistas in neighboring Nicaragua. Honduras then would
ask the United States for assistance, permitting intervention by
U.S. forces.
   Alvarez also supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against
suspected Honduran guerrillas that U.S. officials privately viewed
as a success.
   Human rights activists charged the campaign relied on death
squads linked to the military and that at least 100 people
disappeared or were jailed illegally. Honduran forces deny the
charges.
   Honduran officials wanted to keep a low profile on the Contras
and officially denied their presence, even when thousands of them
operated from border camps.
   Alvarez's denunciations of the Sandinistas brought embarrassing
attention to the U.S. role in Honduras and Honduran support for the
Contras.
   Military officers led by then-Gen. Walter Lopez Reyes ousted
Alvarez from his post in 1984, and he went to exile in Miami after
being given a dishonorable discharge.
   U.S. officials said in 1984 that Suazo Cordova ousted Alvarez
because he was meddling in politics. Most Honduran political and
military sources said the Honduran military command orchestrated the
ouster because he would not consult them on vital decisions.
   About 12,000 Contra fighters now are believed to be in camps
along the Honduran border. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in
February 1988 and they now receive only humanitarian aid.
   In the two previous assassinations this month, veteran Contra
military commander Manuel Adan Rugama Acevedo was fatally shot just
outside the capital on Jan. 7. Nicaraguan rebel radio on Monday
blamed the Popular Liberation Forces for the killing.
   Also Monday, two gunmen killed Carlos Diaz Lorenzana, a lawyer
for reputed drug baron Juan Ramon Matta, whose extradition to the
United States last year caused riots and a state of emergency.
   Alvarez maintained he was deposed illegally, but returned to
Honduras in April 1988 after the army command guaranteed his
security.
   He then became an activist with an evangelical church. He was
frequently seen walking the streets of Tegucigalpa alone, in
civilian garb and without bodyguards.
   He told a meeting of Christian businessmen in December, ``I've
embraced Christ in order to forget the rifle.''

   Despite his tears, executed killer Ted Bundy
remained cold-blooded and manipulative to the last as he dribbled
out information on his victims in hopes of delaying his execution,
an investigator said Wednesday.
   Robert Keppel, a state attorney general's investigator who
tracked Bundy for nearly 15 years, said he believes Bundy may have
killed more than 100 girls and women.
   As Keppel spoke at a news conference, the Florida prosecutor who
sent Bundy to the electric chair Tuesday estimated he may have slain
as many as 50 young women. The FBI said it was still analyzing the
confessions given to a parade of law enforcement officers Bundy
invited to the Florida State Prison beginning late last week.
   ``The whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning,''
Keppel said of the confessions, in which he participated. He
dismissed as phony Bundy's final interview putting some of the blame
for his activities on pornography.
   ``Pornography is maybe one-one-thousandths of the whole problem
he had,'' Keppel said, adding that the interview with James Dobson,
a religious broadcaster and psychologist, ``was totally
self-serving.''
   He said the only remorse Bundy felt in his final hours was for
himself.
   Bundy, 42, admitted during his final days to killing 23 women,
including 11 in Washington state, officials said. He was convicted
of killing three others.
   Keppel said he believes the toll is much higher, and that the
exact numbers and details will never be known.
   ``My feeling is he has killed way over 100,'' said Keppel, who as
a King County detective investigated the eight ``Ted'' killings in
the Seattle area that occurred in 1974.
   Bundy confessed to those crimes, and to killings in Utah,
Colorado and Idaho.
   Keppel has interviewed Bundy several times in the past few years,
and said he would take the information gathered in his latest
sessions and present it to other law agencies in hopes it will help
solve still-unexplained murders.
   During the final interviews, Keppel also questioned Bundy about
the Green River killings of western Washington and Oregon, primarily
to gain insight into how a serial killer thinks and acts. Bundy was
imprisoned in Florida when the Green River killings began in the
early 1980s.
   Keppel played a tape he had recorded during a session with Bundy
on Friday, when the former Tacoma resident and law school dropout
admitted to killing the eight ``Ted'' victims.
   In the tape, Bundy describes how he lured a University of
Washington student, Georgann Hawkins, to his car, beat her with a
crowbar, and then drove her to a secluded, grassy spot in the hills
near Issaquah, east of Seattle.
   Keppel would not play the part of the tape where Bundy detailed
how he killed and apparently mutilated her and other victims, out of
respect for the families of the victims.
   ``I was shocked,'' he said of the way the victims were treated.
He said investigators hadn't known Bundy's methods because the
victims were found weeks and months after their deaths, and many
bones had been strewn by animals.
   Keppel said Bundy used stalling tactics during the last days,
even as he invited law enforcement officers from various states to
the prison to talk about murder cases.
   Bundy would ``let 'em squirm, let 'em dangle, for a little more
information,'' said Keppel, hopeful that such tactics would win him
a last-minute respite from the death penalty, if only temporarily.
   However, it was only because death was imminent that Bundy did
confess at all, added Keppel. Had the Florida governor indicated in
the slightest way he would spare Bundy to allow law officers more
time to question him, Bundy would have clammed up, Keppel said.
   He also said law enforcement officers would have been well
advised to use a different method in questioning Bundy, with those
who were successful given more of the task.

<TEXT>
   The fourth game of the World Chess Championship
Candidates quarterfinal between Kevin Spraggett of Canada and Artur
Yusupov of the Soviet Union ended in a 17-move draw Wednesday,
leaving the match score tied 2-2.
   Playing with the advantage of the white pieces, Spraggett
exchanged the queens on the ninth move of a Reti opening, but failed
to gain any advantage in the resulting endgame.
   Some experts attributed Spraggett's lackluster performance to the
psychological fallout from his loss Tuesday in the third game, which
enabled Yusupov to tie the score.
   Spraggett, a 34-year-old from Montreal, seized the lead in the
six-game contest with a victory in the second game.
   The winner of the Candidates cycle will challenge world champion
Garri Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   The fifth game will be played Friday with Yusupov, 28, playing
white. Jean Hebert, a Canadian international master who is
commentating on the games, said Spraggett will use the free day
Thursday to improve his black defenses.
   French chess expert Catherine Jaeg said the contest resembled
``roulette.'' With just two games remaining, she said, one blunder
or brilliancy would decide the outcome.
   In case of a 3-3 tie, two more games will be played, followed by
a series of tiebreakers played at an increasingly fast pace. A win
scores one point and a draw a half.
   British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman is already through to the
semifinal stage after defeating fellow Briton Nigel Short in August.
   The third quarterfinal, between former world champion Anatoly
Karpov of the Sovit Union and Icelandic Grandmaster Johann
Hjartarson, will begin Saturday in Seattle.
   The fourth contest, scheduled to start Jan. 31, pits Dutch
Grandmaster Jan Timman against Lajos Portisch of Hungary.

   Attorney Ronald Brown, who directed Jesse
Jackson's operations at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,
claimed victory Wednesday in the race for the party chairmanship
after he received the endorsement of his chief rival in the
four-candidate race.
   ``I am ending my campaign today and I am endorsing Ron,'' said
Rick Wiener, the Michigan Democratic Party chairman, widely regarded
as Brown's principal competitor.
   Brown immediately issued a statement thanking Wiener and saying,
``I now have more than enough votes to win the chairmanship of the
DNC.
   ``I am very, very pleased and look forward to leading a united
party for the next four years. My first priority is to reach out to
all Democrats. Our strength as a party depends on our ability to
appeal to Americans in every region with a message of strength and
hope.''
   Two other candidates _ former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma and
James Stanton of Ohio _ remained in the race, but Brown and Wiener
were considered the two contenders with the largest blocs of support.
   Jones said his aides were calling Wiener supporters to see how
many would support the Oklahoman.
   ``I believe in making a decision based on reality and real
numbers,'' he said. ``Until we get them, I'm not going to decide''
whether to continue his campaign.
   Stanton had no immediate comment.
   The Democratic National Committee will meet in Washington on Feb.
10 to elect a successor to Paul G. Kirk Jr. who is completed a
four-year term as head of the party.
   Many party leaders urged Kirk to seek a second term to avoid a
potentially divisive fight for the chairmanship, but he opted to
step aside.
   Some of the strongest opposition to Brown came from southerners
concerned about his ties to Jackson and the liberal wing of the
party.
   In his campaign for the chairmanship, Brown received the support
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, as well as
the endorsement of the AFL-CIO.
   ``Ron is probably the most qualified guy in the race,'' said
Florida Democratic Party chairman Charles Whitehead. ``But the
perception in this state is that Ron is Jesse's and Ted's and
labor's guy. ... It poses me a political problem a little bit in
Florida.''
   Brown served as Jackson's convention manager and was widely
credited with helping to end the convention on a note of unity the
night that Michael Dukakis accepted the presidential nomination and
then was joined on the podium by Jackson and his family.
   A former vice chairman of the party, Brown had worked for Kennedy
as general counsel and staff director of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. He was deputy campaign manager for Kennedy's unsuccessful
bid for the 1980 presidential nomination.
   After the 1988 Democratic convention, Brown served as a senior
adviser to the Dukakis presidential campaign.
   Wiener ended his campaign shortly after the four contenders
appeared at a closed meeting of the House Democratic Caucus.
   ``It wasn't that exciting,'' said Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, a supporter of Brown. ``Since we don't have a vote,
it wasn't exactly clear what was supposed to be happening.''
   A former party vice chairman, Brown was working hard to create a
bandwagon mood that would swing more votes his way.
   ``Ron Brown continues to move closer to winning the chair of the
DNC,'' said his campaign manager Carl Wagner as he announced that 45
committee members from Western states were endorsing the Washington
attorney.
   ``We're at the threshold of victory,'' he said.
   One House Democratic source, who asked not to be identified, said
that during the meeting with the caucus, Brown assured House members
he would remain neutral in the race for the 1992 Democratic
presidential nomination _ a year when Jackson is considered likely
to make his third bid for the nomination.
   Brown also emphasized that his role in party affairs began years
before May 1988 when he agreed to join the Jackson campaign as
convention manager.
   One vocal opponent of the black attorney, Alabama Party chairman
John Baker, said his opposition had nothing to do with Brown's race
or his role in the Jackson campaign.
   Baker said he objected to turning the party leadership over to
someone he described as part of the ``ultra liberal'' wing of the
party.
   ``I can't help the fact that he's black,'' said Baker. ``I can't
help the fact that he was Jesse Jackson's campaign manager.''

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower told
former colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee on
Wednesday ``there is a need for reform'' at the Pentagon and he will
work with them to achieve it.
   On the opening day of his confirmation hearing, Tower also said
that he would aim for budget savings and realized the Bush
administration must ``try to achieve as much or more defense with
less money.''
   Tower, a Texas Republican, was chairman of the Armed Services
Committee from 1981-84 and led the fight in Congress to approve
President Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup. However, he
rebuffed suggestions that he might be unable to cut the Pentagon
budget.
   ``I am not such a mindless hawk that I will come before you and
ask for increases I know you will not grant,'' Tower told the
committee.
   On the Soviet Union, Tower said he welcomed changes brought by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but he also said they did not
``alter the fact that in terms of political philosophy and offensive
capability, the Soviet Union remains our greatest adversary.''
   At the Pentagon, ``there is a need for reform,'' declared Tower,
vowing to implement changes legislated by Congress.
   He told lawmakers he had severed his ties with defense
contractors for whom he worked as a consultant over the past two
years, and said he would appoint ``tough, aggressive'' deputies and
adopt a policy of ``zero tolerance'' toward misbehavior in the
Pentagon.
   Tower said he would review all U.S. weapons systems with the
knowledge ``that difficult choices be made.''
   ``Nothing is sacred,'' he said. ``There is no room in the future
of the defense budget for costly mistakes.''
   ``We can't afford any more pet rocks, whether they are my pet
rocks, the services' pet rocks, or Congress' pet rocks,'' said Tower.
   Tower declined to answer some of the toughest questions from his
former colleagues on whether he favored purchasing major weapons
systems as the mobile Midgetman missile, the rail-based MX missile,
or the B-2 stealth bomber. He said those decisions awaited review by
the new administration.
   Tower's former colleagues treated him with respect, although many
said in their introductory remarks they would quiz him fairly but
fully on a range of other topics, including health, personal and
professional matters.
   Panel chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the committee would be
reviewing a lengthy Federal Bureau of Investigation report that he
said was completed on Jan. 6. The time required to complete that
review reportedly delayed Bush's nomination of Tower.
   At the close of the session Wednesday, Nunn said the hearings
would resume Thursday with questions on possible conflict of
interest involving contractors with whom Tower had acted as a
consultant. But there seeemed little doubt that Tower would be
confirmed.
   On Wednesday, Nunn questioned Tower on how he planned to trim
Pentagon spending and what changes he would support in U.S. defense
and diplomatic policies.
   ``U.S. national security strategy is currently overreaching and
ambiguous,'' said Nunn.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texan who was the Democratic vice
presidential nominee last fall, introduced him and said he hoped
``the committee, after giving him his baptism of fire, will approve
his nomination.''
   ``John Tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check
from the U.S. Treasury to the Pentagon,'' said Bentsen.
   Two Republican senators, Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and
Phil Gramm of Texas, also testified on Tower's behalf.
   A committee liberal, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that
when Tower was chairman, ``I didn't always agree with Senator Tower,
but I respected him and look forward to working with him as
secretary of defense.''
   Tower's confirmation hearing took place in the Senate Caucus
Room, the big hall used during the Watergate and Iran-Contra
hearings. Aides said that some sensitive issues might be raised in
sessions closed to the public.
   Last month, Tower, who is 63, was hospitalized for surgery to
remove a cancerous rectal polyp and later a benign polyp and a
12-inch piece of his colon.
   Questions linger from his personal life, as well. He was divorced
in 1987 from his second wife, Lilla, who charged that he had
committed ``marital misconduct.''
   As the hearing got under way, Tower introduced his three
daughters, Penny, Marian and Jeanne, and his first wife, Lou, with
whom he remains on friendly terms. He declined Nunn's invitation to
introduce other friends, including Dorothy Heyser, his companion for
the past year, who sat behind Tower family members.
   Tower spent 24 years in the Senate, retiring in January 1985.
Shortly thereafter, he was appointed chief negotiator to arms
control talks with the Soviets in Geneva. He quit that after 14
months, and served as chairman of the presidential panel that
investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   One committee member, Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., commended Tower
on ``the hard-headed approach'' he said Tower took as a negotiator.
   For the past two years, Tower has worked as a defense consultant
in Washington, advising industry giants such as Rockwell
International, Martin Marietta and LTV. In 1988, Tower earned more
than $665,277 in consulting and director fees, and more than $74,000
for speaking engagements, according to his financial disclosure
report. Additionally, he received $48,743 in federal pensions, the
records show.

   An alleged gang-rape victim forced under
threat of jail to testify was taken from the courthouse on a
stretcher Wednesday, but hospital officials declined to say why she
fell ill.
   Meanwhile, a prosecution witness who admitted he once told a
psychiatrist the alleged attack victim ``loved it'' testified
Wednesday that she cried and tried to resist the men who sexually
assaulted her on the hood of a car last March.
   An ambulance took the woman to Alice Physicians and Surgeons
Hospital just before she was to begin her second day of testimony in
the aggravated kidnapping trial of Felipe Chew, who also faces a
separate sexual assault trial in the case.
   Nine other men have also been indicted in the incident, in which
the woman claimed she was assaulted by up to 20 men. All have
pleaded innocent. The woman's testimony in the case's first trial in
September led to the sexual assault conviction of a 24-year-old man,
who was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
   The woman was reported in stable condition. Hospital emergency
room personnel and nursing supervisors said the woman's physician
refused to release further information.
   After the woman was taken to the hospital, District Judge
Gilberto Hinojosa told the jury she had ``fallen ill'' and would
testify later. Her testimony was cut short Tuesday after she
reported fainting during an afternoon break and said her stomach and
head ached.
   Witness Jose Carlos Briones, speaking in Spanish as a court
interpreter translated, testified Wednesday that the woman ``didn't
want to do it. She was complaining. She had tears.''
   Briones, 29, was indicted on a sexual assault charge in the case,
but his trial date has not been set.
   Briones, who also testified for the state in the September trial,
said he saw Chew sexually assault the woman with a beer bottle while
other men held her down on the car at a ranch where a cockfight was
being held.
   ``He just laughed,'' Briones said of Chew, adding that the woman
clearly did not appear to enjoy it.
   He admitted Wednesday, however, to Chew's attorney, Jaime Garza,
that during a court-ordered mental-competency examination last June
he told a psychiatrist that the woman ``loved it.''
   Briones testified that he fondled the woman and tried to have sex
with her that night, but that he had consumed two cases of beer that
rendered him impotent.
   Garza asked Briones if he knew of a reported arrangement by the
prosecution to recommend probation for him if he testified against
his co-defendants, but Briones said he was not aware of such a deal.
   Also Wednesday, District Attorney's investigator Jerry Galvan
testified that the morning after the reported abduction and gang
rape the woman appeared ``withdrawn, almost in shock.''
   The woman had asked not to testify Tuesday, saying publicity from
the case disrupted her personal life, but she took the stand after
Hinojosa threatened to jail her for contempt of court.
   The judge also denied defense and state motions Tuesday to
dismiss the aggravated kidnapping charge against Chew. Later in the
day the woman testified that Chew helped abduct her.
   Garza said in his opening statement Tuesday the trial would
include testimony about nymphomania.

   A hospital administrator said
Wednesday he is investigating the discovery of a human fetus and
amputated body parts buried on the hospital's grounds.
   Domingo Alvarez, of San Juan's Auxilio Mutuo Hospital, said he is
trying to determine whether hospital employees were responsible for
the improper disposal of the remains.
   Workers digging a ditch Tuesday behind the hospital's emergency
room unearthed plastic bags containing the decomposed remains of a
fetus of undetermined age, along with nine legs and two toes,
authorities said.
   Police found four more legs at the site Wednesday before calling
off their search, said government prosecutor Pedro Claverol.
   Forensic pathologist Yucasta Brugal said the nine legs found
Tuesday were amputated from patients apparently afflicted with
gangrene.
   Ms. Brugal said she would question hospital staff about the
disposal after the remains were analyzed.
   ``All I can say is that the parts were not adequately disposed
of,'' she said, adding that body parts are usually cremated or
buried at an authorized site.

<HEAD>Draft Agreement Would Transfer Indian Artifact Collection to Smithsonian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A draft agreement has been reached to transfer
title to the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts from
New York's Museum of the American Indian to the Smithsonian
Institution, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   ``The plan is still being negotiated and there's nothing that's
signed,'' said Madeleine Jacobs, spokeswoman for the Smithsonian.
   Essentially, the agreement would transfer title of the Heye
Collection to the Smithsonian, but the Smithsonian would be
obligated to maintain a satellite museum of ``significant'' size in
New York, Jacobs said.
   This would legally fulfill terms of the trust which established
New York's Museum of the American Indian 73 years ago and which
requires the collection to be in New York.
   Under the draft agreement, most of the collection would be housed
in a new national museum of the American Indian to be built by the
Smithsonian on the Mall in Washington.
   The New York museum could be located in the old U.S. Custom House
in lower Manhattan, as has been previously suggested, but ``that's
one of the things that's open to negotiation at this point,'' Jacobs
said.
   The draft is to be presented to the Smithsonian's regents next
week. The Museum of the American Indian had not signed the
memorandum either, Jacobs said.
   The latest proposal emerged after years of debating how best to
preserve and exhibit the more than 1 million artifacts comprising
the collection of the late George Gustav Heye. The current Museum of
the American Indian, in upper Manhattan, is only big enough to
display about 1 percent of the collection.
   In addition, it is located in a decaying neighborhood which
attracts few casual visitors. The rest of the collection has been
moldering in a four-story warehouse in the Bronx.
   Various plans had been raised for several years to move the
collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of going to
Dallas. But New York City officials intervened, pointing out that
the Heye trust requires that it remain in New York.
   Last April, Smithsonian officials rejected a proposal to break
the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one
remaining at the old Manhattan site and another moving into the old
U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan. The Smithsonian's key
objection to the earlier plan was that it did not want only to have
borrowing privileges.

   Two women were killed but their two male companions
sailed to safety Wednesday when their 38-foot sailboat caught fire
and exploded offshore, authorities said.
   The boat ``exploded and burned all the way down to the water
line'' at 1 a.m. about 200 yards off Adams Key in Biscaye National
Park, south of Miami, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jerry Snyder.
   The men were in a forward sleeping compartment and the women were
sleeping in the center galley compartment where the fire started,
probably in an alcohol stove, said Florida Marine Patrol Capt. Ed
Sharp.
   ``The two men heard the women hollering `Fire,''' said Sharp. The
men escaped through a front hatch, jumped overboard and swam to a
dinghy tied to the boat as the fire engulfed the vessel, he said.
   Harry V. Spade, 57, of Sanibel, owner and operator of the sloop,
and John Donahue, 52, of Trumbull, Conn., rowed about a mile to the
Ocean Reef Club on the tip of North Key Largo, said Sharp. The men
were treated for minor burns at James Archer Smith Hospital in
Homestead and released.
   Three helicopters and three patrol boats searched for the women's
bodies, which were found by patrol divers aboard the sunken boat,
Snyder said.
   One victim was identified as Cathleen Ryan, 45, of Washington,
N.J. The other woman was not identified.
   The four set sail Tuesday from Miami Beach for Sanibel on
Florida's Gulf Coast, Sharp said. They had anchored off Adams Key
for their first night.

<HEAD>U.S. Lawyer Argues in Supreme Court for Right to Take Notes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American lawyer argued in an unusual hearing
before the full Supreme Court on Wednesday that Japan should end
restrictions on taking notes in courts.
   Lawrence Repeta of Seattle charged that the ban on notetaking by
spectators in most criminal trials restricts freedom of reporting,
since only members of exclusive judiciary press clubs generally are
allowed to take notes.
   In Japan's controversial press club system, most government
agencies give preferential access to information to members of
semi-official press clubs. The clubs generally exclude foreign
journalists and Japanese reporters who work for smaller newspapers
and magazines.
   While attending a tax trial in 1983-84 as part of his research on
Japanese tax law, Repeta was repeatedly denied permission by the
judge to take notes. With support from the Japanese Civil Liberties
Union, he lodged a complaint, which was rejected by both the Tokyo
District Court and the Tokyo High Court.
   ``It's a very important international issue,'' Repeta said in an
interview. ``You can't take notes unless you are in a press club,
and no foreign reporters are members of the press clubs. If we win,
that will change.''
   Repeta's Supreme Court appeal hearing Wednesday was unusual
because foreigners seldom address the court, and it is rare that all
15 Supreme Court justices hear a case.
   Speaking in Japanese, Repeta urged the judges to ``set a
democratic standard of openness that will ultimately be followed by
other branches of the Japanese government.''
   In an interview, he said: ``The big question is this: What is the
standing of Japan in the world and what kind of model will Japan
give the rest of the world?
   ``Japan's national government has been very slow in adopting any
changes that would increase the openness of information. If the
Supreme Court doesn't show an example of openness, we can't expect
much from the Diet (parliament) or other government agencies,'' he
said.
   The Tokyo High Court said in rejecting Repeta's appeal in
December 1987 that if ``there is even a slight possibility that
influence may be exerted upon the fair and smooth conduct of a
trial, restrictions on taking of notes are unavoidable.''
   Although members of court press clubs are allowed to take notes,
they do not have access to court documents and can take photographs
only before the actual start of a trial, said Takeshi Maezawa,
ombudsman of the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.
   ``We Japanese journalists should place importance on matters
affecting freedom of the press, freedom of information and the
exchange of information between Japan and the rest of the world, and
understand the greater implications of this case with regard to
those matters,'' he wrote in a column.

   Wet weather extended Wednesday from northern Louisiana to the
Rockies, while most of the Southeast enjoyed temperatures in the 70s.
   Snow was expected through Wednesday night in the White Mountains
of eastern Arizona. Snowfall overnight Tuesday in Arizona included 7
inches at Pinetop, 5 inches at McNary, and 2 inches at Show Low.
   Blowing and drifting snow continued Wednesday across the upper
Yellowstone Valley of south-central Montana.
   Snow, freezing rain and sleet fell in the western Oklahoma
Panhandle.
   Snow showers extended from much of Minnesota across northern
Wisconsin into Upper Michigan, across eastern South Dakota,
northeast through southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Colorado, and
northern New Mexico. Snow and freezing rain reached from northern
Iowa into southern Minnesota.
   Rain showers drenched northern Texas, Oklahoma, northern
Louisiana, Missouri, western Illinois and the remainder of Iowa.
Thunderstorms were scattered among the rain showers from northeast
Missouri to north-central Texas.
   Rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included 1} inches
at Tulsa, Okla., almost an inch at Joplin, Mo., and about
three-quarters of an inch at San Antonio. Snowfall during the same
six hours included 3 inches at Pueblo, Colo., and an inch at
Lincoln, Neb., and Omaha, Neb.
   Temperatures remained warm over much of the Southeast. Noontime
temperatures were in the 70s from South Carolina across Florida,
over much of the central Gulf of Mexico states, Louisiana and the
eastern quarter of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees below zero at Idaho Falls, Idaho, to 81 degrees at McAllen,
Texas. The low temperature for the nation Wednesday morning was 48
degrees below zero at Wilson, Wyo.
   The forecast for Thursday was for snow in Upper Michigan and from
New England across much of inland New York, mixed with freezing rain
in northeast Pennsylvania and south-central New York. Rain was
predicted from southeast and western New York across the remainder
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Ohio Valley, lower Michigan, the
Tennessee Valley, much of Illinois, the southeast two-thirds of
Missouri, Arkansas, northern through western Louisiana, eastern
Oklahoma and the northeast third of Texas. Rain showers, and snow in
higher elevations, were expected in Arizona into southeast
California.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the teens in northern
Maine, 20s and 30s in New England, New York, the upper Great Lakes
region, Minnesota, northwest Missouri, northern and central Plains,
much of Oklahoma, the Rockies, the upper Missouri Valley, the
northern Plateau and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah.
Highs should be in the 60s and 70s from the Virginias across central
Florida, from the Tennessee Valley across the central Gulf of Mexico
states, and over Louisiana. Temperatures may reach the low 80s in
southeast Texas and southern Florida.

<HEAD>Soviet Withdrawal From Hungary Detailed; Karpov Optimistic About
Geneva</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Defense Minister Gen. Dimitry
Yazov has given a breakdown of troops to be withdrawn from Hungary
over the next two years as part of a unilateral Soviet troop
reduction plan, media reported Wednesday.
   In Geneva, the Soviet senior arms expert said Moscow will seek
early progress at Vienna talks on reducing conventional forces in
Europe that are due to start in March.
   Yazov detailed the withdrawal figures in a letter to Hungarian
Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati, saying the first stage to be
completed by July will include one armoured division and an armoured
training regiment, the official news agency MTI reported.
   However, Karpati gave no exact date for the start of the
withdrawal and MTI said the Hungarian defense minister refused to
say how many troops are to leave in the three-stage pullout.
   He said the Kremlin would publish a detailed timetable on what
forces would be removed and when by the end of this month.
   There are an estimated 62,000 Soviet troops stationed in Hungary
and Karpati and other officials have said about one fourth of them
are to be withdrawn under the Kremlin plan.
   The withdrawals are part of a unilateral move announced in
December by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to remove some
50,000 troops from Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia as well
as 5,000 tanks by 1990.
   The gesture was intended to give impetus to the March talks in
Vienna.
   Karpati said Yazov's schedule foresaw the withdrawal of an
airborne assault battalion and a fighter plane regiment from
Hungarian territory in the second half of this year.
   In 1990, a chemical defense battalion and the staff of a training
school for non-commissioned officers in eastern Hungary would be
withdrawn, MTI quoted Karpati as saying.
   In Geneva, Victor Karpov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and
senior arms control expert, suggested the scheduled Vienna talks
stand a better chance of success than their failed predecessor, the
Mutual Balanced Force Reduction Talks launched in the early 1970s.
   ``We are going to participate in those talks open-mindedly,''
Karpov said of the conference, due to start March 9 with 23 nations
from East and West.
   He said Moscow intends to ``help from the very start to negotiate
solutions that can bring in a very short period of time real
reductions,'' with elimination of imbalances between the two camps'
military power in Europe as first priority.
   He added the Soviets are ``not rigid'' on the issue of
verification and ``will be ready to discuss various possibilities.''
   Karpov was in Geneva to lead a Soviet delegation to a U.N.
disarmament workshop.
   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK reported Wednesday that
the Warsaw Pact is to hold annual military exercises in
Czechoslovakia in the first half of February.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI reported that the exercises,
code-named ``Friendship '89'' will involve the Hungarian and
Czechoslovak armies as well as Soviet forces stationed in
Czechoslovakia.
   Neither news agency gave an exact date for the exercise.

<TEXT>
   A former diplomat said on Wednesday he was
told the chief of the military government's secret police ordered
the assassination in Washington of dissident Chilean politician
Orlando Letelier.
   Jose Miguel Barros said in sworn testimony the mastermind was
identified to him as Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda. The United
States has tried for years to extradite the former secret police
chief and his assistant, Col. Pedro Espinoza, both now retired.
   Contreras denied the accusations Wednesday night. ``Neither I nor
any official of the intelligence agency were involved'' in the
killing, he said on Santiago's Channel 13.
   Letelier and American aide Ronnie Moffitt were killed Sept. 21,
1976, when a remote-controlled bomb blew up their car. He had been a
Cabinet minister and ambassador to the United States for the
government overthrown by Gen. Augusto Pinochet in 1973, and was
among Pinochet's most influential critics abroad.
   Barros was one of seven former officials questioned last week at
the request of the U.S. Justice Department. Newspapers carried his
testimony in Wednesday's editions and Barros confirmed the accounts
to The Associated Press.
   He told testified to Judge Julio Banados that air force Gen.
Enrique Montero told him during a meeting in the late 1970s ``this
genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate
Letelier.''
   Barros said Montero, then undersecretary of the Interior Ministry
in the Pinochet government, identified the ``genius'' as Contreras,
head of the National Intelligence Directorate secret police at the
time of the assassination.
   In his testimony, Barros said another participant in the meeting,
former Foreign Minister Miguel Schweitzer, told him Pinochet did not
know of the plot.
   Schweitzer said Pinochet ``asked Contreras three times privately
and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to
do with the Letelier case and Contreras said no,'' Barros testified.
   Pinochet later ordered administrative sanctions against Contreras
``for lying to the president,'' the former ambassador said.
   The Supreme Court rejected the U.S. extradition request in 1979
on grounds of insufficient evidence that Contreras and Espinoza were
involved.
   An American employee of the general's secret police, Michael
Townley, confessed in Washington to planting the bomb on the order
of superiors.
   Army Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios, who fled Chile in 1987 and
surrendered to U.S. authorities, confessed to being an accomplice
and implicated Contreras and Espinoza.
   U.S. officials say Chile has not cooperated, and they invoked a
1914 bilateral treaty this month calling for international
arbitration of disputes that cannot be resolved by other means.
Under it, the dispute would go to a commission associated with the
World Court in The Hague, Netherlands.
   ``We energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that
we are handling seriously and professionally,'' Foreign Minister
Hernan Errazuriz declared Tuesday. He said the government had not
decided on a response.

   The prosecutor who sent Ted Bundy to the
electric chair said Wednesday that the serial sex killer may have
slain as many 50 young women, a toll frustrated investigators have
sought to prove for years.
   State Attorney Jerry Blair said that just before Tuesday's
execution at Florida State Prison near Starke, he and an FBI expert
on serial killers informally discussed a weekend of Bundy
confessions.
   Blair said FBI agent Bill Hagmeier told him that Bundy's
confessions closed the books on 13 killings in Washington, Utah and
Colorado; provided information that may never be confirmed on 14
more cases in Washington, Utah, Idaho, California, Vermont and
Pennsylvania, and touched on at least 20 more slayings in various
states dating back to 1969. Three Florida killings charged to Bundy
would be added to the 13 closed cases, putting the total to at least
50.
   ``I don't know that it's far off from the figures everybody has
bandied about anyway,'' Blair said. ``Those are the figures I've
heard for many years. I don't think we'll ever know exactly how
many.''
   Robert Keppel, a Washington state investigator who tracked Bundy
nearly 15 years, said he believes Bundy may have killed more than
100 girls and women _ but that exact details and numbers may never
be known.
   Keppel played a tape he had recorded Friday with Bundy, when
Bundy admitted to the eight ``Ted'' killings of young women in the
Seattle area in 1974.
   In the tape, Bundy describes how he lured a University of
Washington student, Georgann Hawkins, to his car, beat her with a
crowbar, and then drove her to a secluded, grassy spot in the hills
near Issaquah, east of Seattle.
   Keppel said Bundy used stalling tactics in his last days, hoping
to delay his execution by feeding crumbs of information on his
murders to investigators, but would have fallen silent if a reprieve
had come through.
   FBI spokeswoman Kathy Bradford said no formal statement would be
made about Bundy's crimes until officials have been briefed at the
FBI's Quantico, Va., center for the analysis of violent crime.
Hagmeier checked out of his Starke motel Wednesday.
   Until last week Bundy had denied killing anyone. He was convicted
in three slayings in Florida and charged in only one death in
Colorado; several bodies have never been found.
   Bundy, a 42-year-old law school dropout and one-time Republican
activist in Washington state, was executed shortly after 7 a.m.
Tuesday for the 1978 kidnap, rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly
Leach, whose body was found in an abandoned pigsty.
   In an interview Monday with psyhologist James Dobson, Bundy
refused to discuss details of the Leach murder. ``I can't talk about
that right now ... It's too painful.''
   He was also sentenced to death for killing two Florida State
students in their Chi Omega Sorority house on the university campus,
just three weeks before Miss Leach was abducted in Lake City.
   He died under his fourth death warrant.
   ``There is no way in the world that killing me is going to
restore those beautiful children to their parents,'' said Bundy, who
told Dobson he didn't want to die.
   But Bundy said he deserved his punishment, and expressed remorse
about his long, bloody trail of kidnappings, sadistic sexual
mutilations and slayings.
   ``I don't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... (but) I
deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think
society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,''
he said.
   In the 29-minute interview, Bundy said his home life had been
normal but early experiences with pornography had ``crystallized''
violent tendencies within him.
   ``I am essentially a normal person ... except for this
destructive segment,'' he said, emphasizing that he didn't blame
pornography for his actions and took full responsibility.
   ``People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have
been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular
pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We
are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular
families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any
house today.''
   Bundy warned that there were others like himself.
   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people like
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,
by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' he said.
   About 100 people gathered Wednesday in the Rotunda at the state
Capitol for a vigil opposing capital punishment and ``to mourn the
victims of Ted Bundy and to grieve with their friends and
families,'' said Roberta Christie of Amnesty International.
   Also Wednesday, U.S. Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., refiled a bill offered in previous years to cure what Graham
called a federal judiciary ``mired in an encumbering backlog'' of
frivolous appeals.
   If enacted, the bill would give convicted killers a one-year
limit on filing federal ``habeas corpus'' appeals after state-court
appeals were exhausted, and a two-year limit on challenging denials
of such federal appeals.
   A double execution is scheduled in Florida next week. If both Ian
Lightbourn, under his second warrant, and Robert Raymond Clark,
under his fourth death warrant, go to the electric chair, it will be
the first double execution on the same day in nearly 25 years.
   Lightbourn, 29, was condemned for the 1981 shooting of Nancy A.
O'Farrell in Marion County. Clark, 47, was sentenced to die for the
shooting murder of David Drake, who was abducted in 1977 in Pinellas
County.
   Florida last executed two inmates on one day May 12, 1964, when
Sie Dawson and Emmett Blake died 28 minutes apart. Several multiple
executions have been scheduled in recent years, but appeals have
blocked them.

   A huge fireball was spotted over
northwestern Oregon and southern Washington Wednesday afternoon, and
one expert said it probably was an unusually large and fiery meteor.
   The sighting was reported to the U.S. Coast Guard by a
motorcyclist traveling on a coastal highway about 1:30 p.m. Later,
dozens of witnesses reported it to broadcast stations from the coast
to south-central Washington.
   Bruce Spainhower of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry
said that judging from the various reports the fireball was probably
a bolide, a brilliant meteor that appears to explode in the Earth's
atmosphere. Some bolides are large enough that they fail to burn up
completely before hitting the earth's surface as meteorites.
   Witnesses described the fireball as plainly visible on a bright,
sunny winter afternoon, traveling from west to east. Many also
reported they heard a sonic boom after the sighting.
   Spainhower said that if those descriptions of the size and the
trajectory are accurate, it was quite possible the meteor landed
somewhere in eastern Washington.
   He said most meteors _ often called ``shooting stars'' _ range in
size from a pea to a walnut and burn up in the air.
   Spainhower said a bolide of such magnitude is very rare and he
encouraged the public to call in reports to help scientists
determine if it landed, and where.

<HEAD>Stalled Jury in Steinberg Case Goes Three Days without A Verdict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury in the Joel Steinberg murder trial ended
three days of deliberations without a verdict Wednesday, and a
defense lawyer said he was ``guardedly optimistic'' about an
acquittal on the main charge of murder.
   The jurors, who recessed at 8:55 p.m., indicated the day before
they were sharply divided when they asked the judge whether they
could move to the lesser homicide counts against Steinberg if they
were not unanimous on the top count, second-degree murder.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax repeated what he told
the six men and six women before they got the case Monday: That they
must unanimously acquit Steinberg of murdering 6-year-old Lisa
Steinberg before moving down to first-degree manslaughter,
second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
   Deliberations were scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. Thursday.
   Defense lawyer Ira London said the questions the jurors asked
Tuesday and the length of their deliberations had made him
``guardedly optimistic'' about Steinberg being acquitted on the
murder charge.
   ``This is an extremely intelligent jury,'' London said. ``If they
can't resolve the murder charge, they're going to say, `We're not
going to sit here and look at each other,' but they're not going to
permit a mistrial, either.''
   London said he expected the panel to exercise what is known in
legal circles as ``jury nullification.'' This means they would
disregard the judge's legal instructions and do what they feel is
right.
   The jurors sent out no notes during the morning session
Wednesday, and shortly before 6 p.m. asked for a rereading of
testimony by pathologists who testified for the prosecution and the
defense.
   The first was Dr. Douglas Miller, a neuropathologist at New York
University Medical Center and a prosecution witness. He said the
force that caused Lisa's head injuries was equivalent to a
three-story fall and could have been inflicted by a man the size of
Steinberg, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 to 190 pounds.
   The jury also asked to rehear the testimony of Dr. John Plunkett,
a coroner from St. Paul, Minn., and the defense pathologist. He
agreed with Miller that Lisa was the victim of a homicide but
testified her injuries could have been caused by a woman the size of
Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's former companion.
   In addition, the jurors asked to rehear Plunkett's testimony on
the CAT scan of Lisa's brain. The CAT scan, he said, showed that
less force had caused Lisa's injuries than Miller had testified.
   The jurors said that after rehearing the testimony they would go
to dinner and retire for the night.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged in the fatal
beating of Lisa, the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed Long
Island teen-ager and raised as his own but never legally adopted.
   The child was comatose when taken from Steinberg's Greenwich
Village apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, to a hospital where she died of a
brain injury three days later.
   London said he believes Ms. Nussbaum, the prosecution's star
witness, is the center of the jury's deliberation difficulties.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, testified that
Steinberg told her in bed, after they smoked cocaine and while Lisa
lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa
down and she didn't want to get up.''
   Steinberg's lawyers charge that Ms. Nussbaum fatally beat the
child in a jealous rage.
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Nussbaum, against whom murder
charges were dropped after she agreed to be a prosecution witness,
was too physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living
with Steinberg to have harmed Lisa.

<HEAD>Walker Says U.S. Secrets Easy To Steal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Navy secrets are easier to steal than
toothpaste from a department store, former navy radioman and
convicted spy John A. Walker said in an interview broadcast
Wednesday night.
   ``I have to say that K-Mart security is better than anything the
Navy would have. I mean K-Mart protects their toothpaste better than
the Navy protects their top secrets,'' said Walker, who was a chief
warrant officer with top secret clearance.
   Walker spoke in an interview filmed in the federal prison in
Marion, Ill., where he is serving life for running a Soviet spy
ring. The commercial Channel 4 television program, ``Dispatches,''
calling him America's ``most notorious spy,'' said it was the first
time he had been interviewed.
   Walker said the lax security enabled him to photograph decoding
material and technical manuals at U.S. Navy bases and on warships,
from which the Soviets were able to build copies of the latest
cryptographic machines.
   He said when offered some of the material, the Soviets told him
not to bother, indicating they had other spies at work. ``They were
probably paying for the stuff five times,'' Walker said.
   Walker said he was interviewed by the National Security Agency
and ``the boys went pale'' when he told them the Soviets wanted
nothing on machines that went into service in the early 1980s with
the U.S. Navy and NATO, indicating they already had what they needed.
   The program said Walker's spying activities would have
compromised secret material of all the navies in the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. It said the Soviets ``read millions of
secret messages'' exchanged between the various navies.
   The balding, bespectacled and bearded spy looked relaxed and
confident and was smoking a pipe. The program said he insisted on
being interviewed in civilian and not prison garb.
   Walker said his espionage even included updating his own security
clearance and inserting it in his Navy records.
   ``The fact of the matter is I did perfect work for both
governments at the same time. My work for the U.S. Navy was
extraordinary, exemplary. My work for the Soviets was also
exemplary,'' he said.
   The program said the Soviets paid Walker $1 million for supplying
them with code-breaking information over 18 years.
   Walker showed no remorse in the interview and often smiled and
laughed but he said at the end, ``I'm very sorry, sorry for the
Navy, for the country.
   ``The Walker spy ring is behind bars, but there are still more
than 4 million Americans cleared for access to more than a trillion
classified documents. In the past eight years alone, 40 traitors
have been caught trying to sell secrets,'' the program said.
   Walker said in conclusion: ``You have to assume they are not
arresting everybody. What percentage do you think they are arresting
_ half, a third, 1 percent? I don't know.''

<HEAD>Court Revives Discrimination Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived
a lesbian's lawsuit against the CIA for denying her a security
clearance.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a claim that the CIA
has a policy of rejecting clearances for any homosexual _ an
allegation the agency denies _ should not have been dismissed
without a trial.
   The CIA's explanation for its actions in this case suggests the
agency ``considers all persons who engage in homosexual activity to
be unacceptable security risks,'' the court said in a 3-0 decision.
   The ruling allows Julie Dubbs, an openly lesbian employee of a
military contractor on the San Francisco Peninsula, to go to trial
on her claim that the CIA unconstitutionally denied her a high-level
security clearance in 1981.
   Attorney Richard Gayer, noting that his client received a similar
clearance from the Army, said the decision, ``gives us a chance to
embarrass the CIA'' by forcing it to justify its practices. He said
he was disappointed the court required her to prove discrimination
before the federal judge who had previously thrown out her case.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown would not comment on
behalf of the government.
   Dubbs of Santa Clara maintains she needed the clearance to
advance in her job as a senior technical illustrator for SRI
International of Menlo Park.
   The CIA turned her down in a letter that gave two reasons: she
had not volunteered information about her homosexuality during an
initial security investigation, an action that an agency official
described as showing a ``willingness to engage in deceptive
behavior;'' and, although her current lover was also an open
lesbian, Dubbs might have a future partner ``who is not an open
homosexual and who fears public exposure.''

<TEXT>
   Five ranch workers were charged Wednesday in
the slayings of more than 40 wild horses and burros, in a continuing
federal investigation into the killings of at least 10 times that
many animals.
   The workers are charged with violating the Wild and Free Roaming
Horse and Burro Act, a misdemeanor punishable by one year in prison
and a fine of $2,000, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Will Mattly.
   A federal grand jury returned indictments Tuesday naming David
Morehead and Shannon Brennan of Lovelock, Eugene John Thacker of
Winnemucca and David Thacker and Ronald Emory Hage of Cosgrave,
Mattly said.
   The indictments were handed up Tuesday, sealed under a judge's
order so the defendants would not know they had been charged until
they were in custody.
   Mattly He said all but Hage were in custody and Hage was expected
to surrender. The four in custody were held under $50,000 bail.
   Morehead is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or
burro from May 15 through June 1988 and one count of selling a
mustang and a burro to a livestock yard last February.
   He and Brennan are charged in two other counts with killing 28
wild horses and two wild colts in November 1987; Eugene and David
Thacker and Hage face five counts each for killing five wild horses
in August 1987.
   Mattly said the killings were in Lander and Pershing counties,
where more than 500 mustangs have been found dead since last August.
Most of the animals had been shot.
   Mattly gave no motives for the killings and would not say how the
five men were tracked down except to credit ``an extensive
investigation on the part of the Bureau of Land Management law
enforcement staff.''
   Bureau spokesman Bob Stewart said agents ``have very heavily
investigated since it was first brought to our attention last
August. We have interviewed over 200 people and done extensive
on-ground investigation.''
   Maxine Shane, public affairs specialist with the BLM, said the
bureau considered the case to be far from ended.

<HEAD>Church Group Denounces Violence Against Native Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church group on Wednesday denounced the
slaying of 36 Indians during 1988 and blamed the government of
President Jose Sarney for ``increasing violence against native
populations'' in Brazil.
   At least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land, and
in the majority of cases ``authorities took no measures to find or
punish the guilty parties,'' Antonio Brand, executive secretary of
the Indian Missionary Council, said in a press conference.
   Brand said the worst Indian massacre last year was the March 28
slaying of 14 Tikuna Indians in the far northern state of Amazonas
after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer.
   In a press release, the council also mentioned the death of 25
Yanomami Indians through diseases transmitted by white men such as
malaria or poisoning by mercury, which is used by gold prospectors
to refine the precious metal.
   Brand said the government's refusal to remove the thousands of
gold prospectors from Yanomami territory in the Amazon jungle region
``will allow the continued massacre of this people.''
   The Yanomami Indians are Brazil's most primitive tribe and live
almost without contact with the modern world close to Brazil's
northern border with Venezuela.
   Brand said the government was ``responsible for the state of
chronic violence'' that exists in the rain forest, which is rich in
gold, diamonds, iron ore and uranium.
   Currently about 220,000 native Indians and 430 tribes remain out
of a population estimated at 5 million when Brazil was discovered by
the Portuguese.
   About 15 percent of the Amazon has been destroyed by farming,
gold prospecting and mining, according to the U.S.-based Institute
for Policy Studies. An estimated 400,000 gold prospectors are
located throughout the Amazon and, along with farmers and
wood-cutters, often involve themselves in territory disputes with
Indians.

   No cross-wiring problems have been found in the
engine-monitoring systems of 495 Boeing airplanes inspected as a
result of a crash in England earlier this month that killed 44
people, Boeing Co. says.
   The Jan. 8 crash of a British Midland 737-400 airliner occurred
after one of its two engines caught fire, and the pilot shut down
the wrong engine.
   Pilots' union officials have suggested that faulty wiring to
engine monitors, rather than pilot error, could have caused the
crash.
   Boeing said the engine fire detection, overheating and vibration
monitoring systems of 479 model 737-300s and 16 of the
stretch-version 737-400s were checked, and no problems were found.
Reports were not yet in from the remaining nine 737-300s in service
around the world, the company said Tuesday.
   The inspection recommendation was put together by Boeing, engine
manufacturer CFM International, the Civil Aviation Authority of the
United Kingdom and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

<TEXT>
   The government has charged the jailed boss of
the powerful Oil Workers Union with homicide in the 1983 shooting of
a local labor leader, the Attorney General's Office announced
Wednesday.
   It was the second murder charge brought against Joaquin Hernandez
Galicia, who for years was the de facto head of the union.
   Assistant Attorney General Javier Coello Trejos told a news
conference that Hernandez Galicia, 66, ordered the Sept. 8, 1983,
slaying of Oscar Torres Pancardo, a local oil union official and
former congressman.
   Coello said that Hernandez Galicia ordered his own bodyguards to
kill Torres. Coello did not cite possible motives for the killing.
   Torres was killed by a bullet in the head.
   ``This crime has been investigated since it occurred, but
Hernandez Galicia gave us the details,'' Coello said in response to
questions as to why it took so long to identify those responsible
for the slaying.
   Coello identified Mauro Estrada Cruz as the bodyguard who planned
the killing. Estrada was arrested along with Hernandez Galicia on
charges of homicide, weapons possession and resisting arrest.
   Estrada is a former commander with the Federal Judicial Police in
the northeast state of Tamaulipas.
   Four other bodyguards are being investigated in connection with
Torres' killing, Coello said.
   Hernandez Galicia was arrested after a shootout with federal
agents at his home on Jan. 10 in Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, 340
miles northeast of Mexico City.
   Hernandez Galicia, Estrada and seven other detainees were charged
with homicide in connection with the death of a federal agent killed
in the gunfight.
   About 37 other union leaders and associates have been indicted on
charges that include illegal weapons possession and resisting arrest.
   Hernandez Galicia has consistently denied wrongdoing.
   Salvador Barragan Camacho, the union's former secretary-general,
is under arrest at a Mexico City hospital where he is being treated
for heart problems. He also faces corruption and weapons charges.
   Coello also said that another of Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards
has been arrested in connection with drug trafficking but that
Hernandez Galicia has not personally been connected to the case.

   A school bus skidded off a muddy country road
and overturned into a creek Wednesday, killing the driver and a
child despite the efforts of a 16-year-old boy who tossed children
to safety as the bus sank.
   Bill Raley, a sophomore at Wellsville High School who was one of
12 students on the bus, said the bus was upside down in the water
and `` I just started grabbing them and throwing them out the door.''
   Dale R. Thomasson, 46, a teacher, counselor and school bus
driver, and Loren Newkirk II, 8, drowned in the accident,
authorities said.
   Raley ``went back to get the (8-year-old) kid and the bus rolled
again. He jumped out and they said they never saw the driver or the
other kid again,'' said Alan Radcliffe, a Franklin County deputy
sheriff.
   Police said the two victims, both from Wellsville in rural
east-central Kansas, were trapped under the bus in Walnut Creek for
more than an hour before wreckers recovered the vehicle.
   Newkirk was pronounced dead four hours later at an Ottawa
hospital.
   Radcliffe said the bus was en route to school, about seven miles
northeast of Ottawa when it slowed for a curve but ran off the road
after the turn because of muddy conditions.
   The bus then slid onto the bridge over Walnut Creek and rolled
into five or six feet of water.

   A 4-mile-long ditch that a Justice Department
official compared Wednesday to a ``buried Berlin Wall'' is planned
for a stretch of the U.S.-Mexican border to stem drug smuggling into
Southern California.
   But the plan is being criticized as ``too little too late'' by a
group that advocates building fences along the border and blasted as
repressive by immigrant rights organizations.
   Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating II said he proposed
the idea last fall as a way to discourage drug smugglers from
driving loads of cocaine, marijuana and heroin across the border
near San Diego.
   The plan being undertaken by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service was approved last month by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
Keating said.
   The ditch, which Keating likened to ``our buried Berlin Wall''
will be deep and wide enough to discourage smugglers from driving
trucks and cars across the border along a four-mile stretch of flat
desert east of San Ysidro, Calif.
   The associate attorney general, who is leaving office with the
start of the Bush administration, said the desert stretch in the
Otay Mesa area east of San Ysidro is a major drug smuggling route.
   ``The cocaine, marijuana and heroin from Mexico is being carried
across the border between the points of entry'' that are operated by
the Customs Service, Keating said.
   ``This is not intended in any way to interfere with legitimate
traffic or trade, it is not intended to stop legal entry,'' he said.
   The Border Patrol has tried to stop vehicle traffic across the
desert by digging shallow trenches, but smugglers have been able to
fill in the ditches to drive through, Keating said.
   ``No country is a country that can't protect its border,'' said
Keating, who oversaw law enforcement agencies in the Justice
Department, including the Border Patrol. ``This is one of many
systems to do it.''
   ``I am sure it will be applauded by people who are sick and tired
of the deluge of cocaine and heroin that is flowing across the
Mexican border,'' Keating said in an interview.
   In California, Dale Cozart, chief U.S. Border Patrol agent in the
San Diego sector, said, ``This is no panacea to all of the
drive-through situations we have in the Otay Mesa area. It's just
another tool that they'll be using.''
   But the plan has its critics.
   ``The drainage ditch is too little too late if it is to be taken
seriously as a method of deterring illegal entry,'' said Patrick
Burns, assistant director of Federation for American Immigration
Reform.
   ``There is a serious problem at San Diego of which a very, very
small component is high-speed drive-throughs'' by drug smugglers,
said Burns, whose organization is preparing to release a study
proposing ways to ``harden'' the U.S.-Mexican border.
   Burns said a barrier of earth reinforced with concrete would be a
more effective means of preventing drug trafficking across the
desert.
   Eugene Hernandez, an official of the Mexican-American Political
Association in Los Angeles, called it ``a very repressive and a very
ill-founded idea.''
   ``Rather than constructing the ditch, I think they should hire
more people, more agents at the border,'' Hernandez said.
   ``Once again, we appear to be obsessed with dealing with symptoms
instead of trying to find solutions'' to illegal immigration, said
Arnoldo Torres, national political director for the Washington-based
League of United Latin American Citizens.
   He said the plan ``will have negative consequences, symbolically
as well as substantively.''
   Keating confirmed a report in Wednesday editions of the Los
Angeles Times, which said the 5-feet deep and 14-foot wide ditch was
planned for completion by next fall.
   The isolated Otay Mesa area, a gateway into Southern California
for illegal immigrants, is believed to be the most popular crossing
spot along the entire 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
   About one third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants captured
along the border last year were apprehended at Otay Mesa.
   Up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally
into San Diego each month, officials said.

   A 6-year-old girl died Wednesday after being
shot in the head by her 8-year-old brother with a gun their
grandmother had purchased for protection against burglars, officials
said.
   The incident occurred during an after-school argument while the
two were home alone, police said.
   The girl had been declared brain-dead following the Monday
afternoon incident, but she was on life-support machines at Fairfax
Hospital. She died after those machines were turned off, hospital
officials said.
   The shooting occurred after the two children returned home from
school, according to police in this Washington, D.C., suburb.
   Police did not release the names of the children. The shooting
occurred at the home of the children's grandmother, Dorothy Bea,
where they had moved last year after their parents separated.
   The incident began when the boy, a second-grader, began playing
with a .32 pistol Mrs. Bea kept in a dresser drawer in her bedroom.
His sister, who was in the first grade, scolded him for playing with
the gun and he responded by shooting her, police said.
   The shooting occurred after the children had returned home from
school, which ended at 1:10 p.m. They were normally alone in the
home until 3 p.m., when an uncle came home, officials said.
   Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr. said
he probably will not file charges against the girl's brother unless
it can be proven the attack was deliberate.
   Horan said police must have evidence that the boy was ``capable
of forming criminal intent'' when he pulled the trigger. ``Does he
know right from wrong? That would be determined by a lot of
things,'' he said.
   Although the shooting was termed deliberate by police, they
weren't sure about the boy's state of mind.
   ``When we say `deliberate,' we mean it was not an accidental
thing,'' said police spokesman Warren Carmichael. ``He did point
(the gun) and he did pull (the trigger). Whether he realized what
would happen ... we're just not in a position to say.''
   Mrs. Bea said she doesn't believe her grandson intended to harm
his sister.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it was an accident,'' she said. ``He's
just eight. He couldn't have known.''
   Mrs. Bea said she bought the gun 18 months ago for protection
against burglars.
   Neither of the children knew she owned a gun until the boy began
rummaging through the dresser drawers after Christmas, Bea said the
boy told police.

   Police staged more than 20 raids
around the capital Wednesday, seeking evidence connected to an
attack on a base that left 36 people dead and at least 68 wounded,
Attorney General Andres D'Alessio said.
   Also Wednesday, President Raul Alfonsin signed a decree creating
a National Security Council to investigate the attack and prevent
subversion.
   Alessio said three of the civilian commandos identified belonged
to radical leftist groups, supporting the government's contention
that the attack was leftist-inspired. He also said the attackers
identified so far are Argentine.
   In all, 17 men and two women between the ages of 19 and 35 were
being held at police headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires,
D'Alessio said. A 20th person was hospitalized with wounds and may
or may not be involved with the commandos, he said.
   Previously, the government acknowleged only 14 people were under
arrest.
   He also said the commandos included five women, two of which were
killed and three arrested.
   Shortly after dawn Monday, about 50 heavily armed civilians burst
through the main gate at the 3rd infantry regiment at La Tablada on
the outskirts of Buenos Aires. By Tuesday afternoon, at least 28
were dead and perhaps 10 others escaped.
   Seven soldiers and a policeman also were killed, officials said.
   The attorney general said police raided between 20 and 25 places
in the capital and its suburbs as part of an investigation of the
base attack. One woman was arrested. D'Alessio declined to give any
further details.
   D'Alessio offered little information about the commandos' motives
and ideology, but the identities of three lent support to the
position of President Raul Alfonsin that the group was comprised of
radical leftists.
   Among the dead were Jose Luis Caldu, a former member of the
Castro-inspired Peoples Revolutionary Army, and Jorge Manuel Banos,
a leader of a spinoff group known as Movement Everyone for the
Country. Banos recently denounced alleged plans by rightists in the
military to overthrow the government and install Peronist
presidential candidate Carlos Menem.
   At least 18 bodies remain to be identified, D'Alessio said.
   ERP, as the People's Revolutionary Army is called by its Spanish
acronym, formally disbanded in 1980 after years of battling with
soldiers in open clashes, and being decimated in the process. The
Movement is a small, little-known organization that includes ex-ERP
militants.
   Under arrest is another Movement leader, Juan Manuel Burgos.
   Pamphlets and statements found among the commandos indicated they
called themselves the Popular Resistance Front, which government
sources say was composed of former members of the ERP, the Movement
and other groups.
   The propaganda indicated the commandos saw themselves as acting
to prevent an imminent right-wing coup.
   There was little indication what the group intended to do at the
base or achieve by the attack; or whether it had links to similar
groups.
   A congressional source with close ties to the left said the
attackers hoped to carry out a lightning raid to demonstrate their
militant opposition to right-wing elements in the army and to
attract popular support, and that they did not intend a shootout.
   Alvaro Alsogaray, presidential candidate of the Center Alliance,
said the government must make sure the attack is an isolated
incident and not the leading edge of a wave of attacks like those
that plagued the country 15 years ago.
   Alfonsin, in a nationwide speech Tuesday night, said resolving
the symptoms if not the causes of subversion ``is the last test of
my government'' and pledged to establish a National Security Council.
   The council, over which Alfonsin personally is to preside, will
include the ministers of defense, interior and foreign relations;
the heads of Argentina's army, navy and air force, and others the
president might choose later.
   The immediate goals are to figure out what happened in Monday's
base attack, determine whether other potential threats exist,
develop strategies of prevention and coordinate information.
   Alfonsin's election in 1983 replaced a military dictatorship. He
will step down in December after national elections in May.

   A three-alarm fire broke out Wednesday in a snack
bar storeroom in the John F. Kennedy Airport International Arrivals
Building, injuring 36 people and forcing 600 to evacuate,
authorities said.
   The injured included civilians, Port Authority police officers
and firefighters and at least two were believed to be in serious
condition, said Capt. Mark Rothstein of Emergency Medical Services.
   Rothstein said 18 people were treated at the scene for smoke
inhalation and the rest were taken to hospitals for treatment of
smoke inhalation.
   The cause of the three-alarm blaze was not immediately known. It
began on the second floor of the building's west wing, in a snack
bar-souvenir store and storage area, said Efrain Parrilla, a Fire
Department spokesman.
   ``It centered in the ceiling of the storage area for the
restaurant,'' said Mark Marchese, a Port Authority spokesman.
   The snack bar is located between Gate 33, which was being used by
Air France at the time of the fire, and Gate 34, which El Al Israel
Airlines was using, said Armando Arrastia, another PA spokesman.
   Air France, El Al, Air Afrique and Royal Air Maroc flights were
delayed because of the fire, Marchese said. No passengers were
aboard the planes but aircraft were moved away from the building
during the fire, he said.
   About 170 firefighters fought the blaze, which was reported at
7:26 p.m. and went to three alarms at 8:21 p.m., said Firefighter
Aaron Foxx, a department spokesman. It was declared under control at
8:49 p.m., he said.
   Chief of Department Homer Bishop said damage to the building was
light but damage to its contents was heavy.
   The fire was under investigation but had not been ruled
suspicious, Parrilla said.

   The American Psychological Association says a
survey of the scientific research on abortion suggests that most
women suffer no lasting emotional problems from the procedure.
   ``By and large, what you find is that most of the women who have
abortions experience a sense of relief,'' Brian Wilcox, director of
public interest legislation at the APA, said in an interview on
Tuesday.
   The APA survey found that much research on the subject has been
flawed, but it also found the notion of a post-abortion syndrome is
not a ``scientifically or medically recognized'' disorder.
   Earlier this month, U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said in
a letter to the White House that there was no scientifically sound
evidence showing negative health effects to the 1.5 million women
who get abortions annually.

   Hours before his execution, Ted Bundy coolly
traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood
glimpses of violent pornography became ``an addiction'' that grew
until his ``destructive energy'' exploded from fantasy into reality.
   The 42-year-old law school dropout, whose bizarre mixture of
intelligence, charm and homicidal bloodlust were the subject of five
books and a TV movie, also warned before his execution Tuesday that
there were others like himself.
   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people like
me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,
by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' Bundy
said in a videotaped interview Monday.
   Bundy, who after a decade of denial told detectives from four
states that he had murdered 23 young women since the mid-1970s, said
he deserved his punishment. His execution in the electric chair at
Florida State Prison elicited cheers from more than 100 people who
stood in a field across from the penitentiary.

   The election of the first woman bishop of the
Episcopal Church has been approved over some adamant objections, but
church officials say they don't expect the misgivings to develop
into a schism.
   Tuesday's mail brought the 60th ballot required to give the Rev.
Barbara C. Harris approval from a majority of the 118 Episcopal
bishops around the nation, said the Rev. James Solheim, spokesman
for the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts.
   Those votes ratified the Sept. 24 election of Harris by the
Boston diocese. The selection of Harris, a former public relations
executive who is black and was once divorced, sent tremors through
world Anglicanism.
   When she is consecrated Feb. 11 in Boston, Harris will become the
first woman bishop elected by a 2.5 million-member church that
believes its leaders to be direct successors of Christ's apostles.

   President Bush is naming a panel to recommend
standards of conduct for government officials, in an attempt to
ensure that he does not face the same allegations of an
administration ``sleaze factor'' that dogged his predecessor.
   Largely to counter such complaints about the Reagan
administration, Bush during his campaign promised to create the
panel as one of his first acts in office.
   Bush today was scheduled to sign an executive order creating the
advisory commission on ethics. It will be chaired by Griffin Bell,
the former attorney general in the Carter administration, and
Malcolm Wilkey, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, the White House said Tuesday.
   Other panel members will include former White House counsels Fred
Fielding and Lloyd Cutler, and Washington attorney Jan Baran, said
White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen. She said she could not confirm
the two remaining names.

   Attorney Ronald Brown has emerged as the
front-runner in the race for Democratic Party chairman, despite
complaints from party conservatives about his association with Jesse
Jackson in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Brown picked up endorsements from West Virginia Democrats on
Tuesday, the latest in a series of announcements that cemented his
position as the man to beat in the race to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr.
as chairman of the party.
   At the same time, an Alabama party leader said election of Brown
as chairman would be a victory for the ``Kennedy, Cuomo, Dukakis
ultra-liberal element.''
   John Baker, Alabama Democratic Party chairman, said Brown was
trying ``play on the liberal conscience'' by making an issue of the
fact that he is black and had ties to Jackson.

   President Raul Alfonsin declared
all-out war on leftist subversion after touring a suburban army base
where at least 36 people were killed in a battle between troops and
besieged civilian commandos.
   Troops were still scouring the smoldering rubble of the ravaged
La Tablada base Tuesday night as Alfonsin told the nation the attack
was ``a new challenge that I believe is the most serious and
decisive of my administration.''
   The 3rd Infantry Regiment base was seized Monday by heavily armed
civilians and retaken a day later by army and police forces who had
pummeled commando positions with howitzers, mortars, grenades and
machine-gun fire.
   In his nationally broadcast speech, the president recalled his
impressions of the base and the charred and mangled corpses he
encountered there: ``It was a nightmare. Death, once again death.
The brutality, the barbarity.''

   Israeli media allege a ``Palestinian popular
army'' is being financed and armed by Yasser Arafat's faction of the
PLO, but some Palestinians say the army exists largely on paper.
   Israeli security forces Tuesday arrested dozens of people
suspected of belonging to the alleged army.
   Some Palestinians say the ``popular army'' is an attempt to
coordinate groups of activists who enforce general strikes, patrol
neighborhoods and punish collaborators in the 13-month uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied territories.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said Tuesday that Israel was
blowing the significance of the issue out of proportion for its
publicity value.
   Kuttab, who has wide contacts in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, called existing groups of activists ``strike forces''
that use stones, not guns, in their clashes with Israeli soldiers.

   A veteran Cuban diplomat secretly defected to
the United States three months ago after becoming disillusioned with
widespread official corruption and with Cuban support for Marxist
rebels in at least three Latin American countries.
   Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, 35, broke with the revolution last
October when he was granted political asylum by U.S. officials, but
his defection was not publicly disclosed until the State Department
made him available for an interview Tuesday with The Associated
Press.
   Aguililla criticized the corruption that he said Cuban officials
engaged in while he was posted in Syria and Iran and added he was
troubled by the lack of freedom and the ``total militarization'' of
Cuban society.
   President Fidel Castro has acknowledged that corruption in Cuba
is a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution has
produced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer
for social welfare projects at home and in numerous Third World
countries.

   Harris was joined at the news conference by Bishop David E.
Johnson of Boston, her new boss, who sounded a note of conciliation.
   ``It is a time for reception, a time for inviting,'' he said.

slain as many 50 young women, a toll frustrated investigators have
sought to prove for years.
   State Attorney Jerry Blair said that just before Tuesday's
execution at Florida State Prison near Starke, he and an FBI expert
on serial killers informally discussed a weekend of Bundy
confessions.
   Blair said FBI agent Bill Hagmeier told him that Bundy's
confessions closed the books on 13 killings in Washington, Utah and
Colorado; provided information that may never be confirmed on 14
more cases in Washington, Utah, Idaho, California, Vermont and
Pennsylvania, and touched on at least 20 more slayings in various
states dating back to 1969. Three Florida killings charged to Bundy
would be added to the 13 closed cases, putting the total to at least

   A 5,000-year-old Irish tomb has yielded new
evidence that it provided a dramatic light show at sunrise of the
winter solstice, making it the oldest known structure with an
astronomical function, a researcher says.
   The new work gives the strongest argument yet that astronomy
influenced its design, an idea suggested by previous research, said
astronomer Tom Ray of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.
   The tomb, built centuries before Stonehenge or the Great
Pyramids, was probably designed to use sunlight for ritual rather
than scientific purposes, Ray said in a recent interview.
   His research used surveying instruments to determine the path of
ancient sunlight in the Newgrange tomb, which is north of Dublin.
The findings appear in Thursday's issue of the British journal

   It's seminar season, time for experts and
unemployed candidates to talk about overhauling the way Americans
nominate and elect their presidents. They'll get scant encouragement
from President Bush.
   Bush, who won once and lost once under the current system, said
he will ``play by the rules until some better ones come along.''
   ``I'm not going to spend any time trying to redo it,'' he said in
an interview prior to his inauguration.
   Campaigns grow longer and more costly every time, presidential
primary elections multiply, and for a while after each election,
there is talk of change in the name of reform. It's been that way
since the Democrats began changing the system nearly 20 years ago.
That changed the process for Republicans, too, because the primary
election laws enacted by state legislatures usually cover both sides.
   So far, efforts at change have only made campaigns more complex,
more expensive and more time-consuming.
   Long before Bush has been in the White House a year, prospective
challengers will be making their first moves toward the 1992
campaign, most of which will have to do with raising money. Step one
these days is to set up a political action committee, to bankroll
preliminary operations.
   All told, there were 38 presidential primary elections in 1988.
On a single night, Super Tuesday, 20 states _ a dozen of them in the
South _ chose nominating delegates by primary or caucus.
   Democratic re-reformers tried to put more political savvy in
their nominating process by guaranteeing party elders and
officeholders seats at the Democratic National Convention. But that
was scaled back at last summer's convention under pressure from
Jesse Jackson, who got almost no support from those ex-officio
delegates.
   That was part of a peacemaking package with Gov. Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic nominee against Bush, and it illustrates the reality
the reformers can't alter. The nominating system in both parties
bends to accommodate the candidates who master it to gain power.
   Southern Democrats devised the Super Tuesday notion, which was
supposed to give their more conservative constituencies an early and
influential voice in the contest for the 1988 Democratic nomination.
It sent the party no clear signal _ the path was left open for
Dukakis. But it was a turning point for the Republicans as Bush came
close to a sweep.
   Bush said early this month that ``the regional concept was ...
something new this time ... and it proved to be a tremendous boon
for me.''
   He said other regions will start looking at alliances that would
cluster their primaries to increase their influence. ``The Western
states some day are going to get together and say, `Why should we be
left out all the time? Why shouldn't we get in there and be up
front?'''
   That's occurred to some other regions, too. New England made a
stab at it, but wound up as an adjunct to Super Tuesday, in part
because New Hampshire was not about to give up its premier primary
to enter into a group.
   There are other proposals for restricting primaries to certain
dates so there would be a limited number of election days during the
primary season, and by a combination of date and region so that
candidates wouldn't spend so much time traipsing between distant
campaign states.
   Bush doubts the revisionists will get far. His skepticism is
founded on experience. It happens every fourth year. Bush said he'd
seen it coming _ ``Everybody's going to go up to Harvard ... and try
to figure out what's wrong with the system.
   ``I don't think you're going to redesign it,'' he said.
   And he certainly isn't going to try. ``Why should I go out and
say Iowa's a lousy idea?'' he asked. ``I'm here because of Iowa. ...
Not Iowa in '88, Iowa in '80.''
   In 1980, Bush upset an absentee Ronald Reagan in the Iowa
precinct caucuses, first event on the presidential campaign
calendar. That vaulted him out of the field and ultimately led to
his nomination for vice president. In 1988, Iowa was his most severe
setback _ Bush ran third. But as vice president he was able to come
back quickly.
   ``You want to get that broad perspective,'' he said, looking
back. That perspective comes most readily to winners.

<HEAD>IRAs Past Their Heyday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It isn't hard to understand why many Americans
have stopped contributing to their individual retirement accounts in
the past couple of years.
   Since 1987, they haven't been allowed to deduct the contributions
on their tax returns if they are covered by a pension plan and have
incomes that exceed specified limits _ $35,000 for single filers and
$50,000 for married couples.
   For those who remain eligible, furthermore, the deduction doesn't
save as much in taxes under the system of lower tax brackets created
by tax reform.
   People in the 15 percent bracket who make $2,000 contributions,
for example, get only a $300 tax break.
   Non-deductible IRA contributions still are allowed for anyone
with income from a job. But non-deductible IRAs have proved to be
less than a big hit.
   That is evidenced by the dropoff that has occurred in IRA
promotions by banks and other financial institutions, especially at
this time of year.
   ``A lot of bankers aren't as hot on the account as before tax
reform,'' reports the newsletter 100 Highest Yields, which tracks
trends in consumer banking. The editors say they have heard reports
that ``some outfits won't promote their IRAs at all in 1989.''
   Analysts who have studied the situation say the IRA's fall from
favor is partly the result of confusion and misunderstanding.
   They say some people who could still make deductible
contributions have the mistaken impression that they no longer can
do so.
   In addition, they observe, savers at all levels often fail to
appreciate the power of tax-free compounding, which still applies
for all IRAs. And there is an understandable reluctance to tie the
money up until age 59{, when withdrawals are permitted with no
penalty.
   Even if you decide to make a non-deductible contribution, your
resolve may weaken when you confront the paperwork and
record-keeping it will require over the years.
   Once you make a non-deductible contribution, you know that you
will someday have non-taxable distributions, assuming that you don't
want to pay taxes on the same money twice.
   That ushers you into the wonderful word of such documents as
Internal Revenue Service Form 8606, ``Nondeductible IRA
Contributions, IRA Basis and Nontaxable IRA Distributions.''
   Form 8606 entitles you to spend an extra 28 minutes (IRS
estimate) each year wrestling with such demons as:
   ``12. Enter total IRA distributions received during 1988. Do not
include amounts rolled over before 1-1-89. (See instructions).
   With all this, though, some advisers on matters of personal
finance contend that people who shy away from IRAs may be missing a
bet, especially if they aren't taking other, compensating steps to
plan for retirement.
   The arguments about keeping savings liquid and avoiding IRS
reporting requirements are ``cogent, but not cogent enough,''
declares Jonathon Pond, president of Financial Planning Information
Inc. in Watertown, Mass.
   ``The tax-deferral feature of IRAs will result in a superior
return versus investing outside the IRA. Quite frankly, we also like
the notion of removing retirement-oriented money from temptation's
reach.
   ``The onerous IRA reporting requirements can be reduced
considerably if only one or a couple of IRA accounts are utilized.''

<HEAD>Head Of Bush's Denomination Urges ``Light'' Of Moral Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Quoting Scripture, the preacher put it to the new U.S. President
this way: ```When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of
God, he dawns on them like the morning light.'''
   The robed, white-haired clergyman, head of the denomination to
which Bush belongs, advised him and others that people today
``hunger for moral leadership, and as they are satisfied, they are
reconciled to one another.''
   The advice came from the Most Rev. Edmond Lee Browning, Presiding
Bishop of the Episcopal Church, at a special worship service last
Sunday attended by Bush and officials of his new administration.
   ``Moral leadership is grounded in the inner disposition of love
and compassion,'' Browning said.
   ``This inner disposition, nurtured by the Holy Writings and
prayer, enables a leader to reach out to tap and release the deep
well of justice and compassion in a nation's people.''
   In the congregation at the National Cathedral, the Episcopal
center in Washington, were Bush's family, his designated Cabinet and
staff, members of Congress, and an ecumenical turnout of religious
leaders.
   Browning, as the Episcopal Church's primate, is the presiding
officer and chief spiritual guide to its 2.8 million members,
including Bush.
   Moral ``leadership makes conscious that which lies unconscious in
the soul of a nation,'' Browning said, his gaze roving over that
gathering of the powerful. ``From this leadership flows healing and
unity of purpose.
   ``From this leadership emerges national greatness of will and
purpose in the exercise of justice and mercy. From this leadership
can come the reconciliation of the peoples of the earth.
   ``When the moral leader shows his inner disposition of love and
compassion through his words and actions, the people recognize,
acclaim and accept its authority.''
   Browning cited Jesus' Sermon on the Mount _ about caring for the
poor, the peacemakers, even ememies _ as setting the fundamental
standards of ``charity and compassion toward each other.''
   ``He helps all people to accept the attributes of a nation that
is blessed by God,'' Browning said. He said those principles were
exemplified in the presidency of Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War.
   Leaders living by those principles pray as Jesus did that God's
will be done, Browning said. ``These moral leaders are blessed
because they can discern what is good and bad, true and false,
corrupt and incorruptible.
   ``They are blessed because they have internalized the will of
God.''
   Browning quoted from the book of Samuel in which God told ancient
Israel's King David that a just ruler dawns on people ```like the
morning light, like the sun shining forth upon a cloudless morning,
like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth'.''
   The homily was one of three delivered at the special service,
culminating a weekend of inaugural events.
   The other two sermons were by Missouri's Gov. John Ashcroft, a
layman of the Assemblies of God, and by the Rev. Peter Gomes, an
American Baptist and minister of Harvard University's Memorial
Church.
   Ashcroft, preaching on care for God's creation, pointed out that
humanity was created from dust.
   ``That makes dust pretty important,'' he said. ``The elements are
not only God's creation, but were chosen by God to represent his own
character. We are dust ... Ultimately contamination of the
environment is self-contamination.''
   Noting that God's first order to Adam was to tend and care for
the garden, Ashcroft said ``wrongful use of the garden brought to
both Adam and the environment a curse.''
   ``We still have the charge to dress the garden and to work it,''
Ashcorft said. ``...We are stewards of creation, of the very
elements from which God chose to create us in his own image.
   ``Others might think it insignificant, but to those who believe,
dust and deity are closely linked...
   ``By giving us dominion over the earth...God has shared with us
his role of creator...In large measure we shape the nature of the
world in which we live. We can create communities of pollution or
purity _ we make the choice...
   ``Fortunately many of our environmental missteps of the past can
be redeemed. We have an incredibly wonderful opportunity to correct
some of our past errors. To clean them up and start over again.''
   Gomes said hope must be restored to the ``destitute of our
American Calcuttas,'' to ``the prisoners of the inner city,'' to
youths, the aged, AIDS sufferers and the ``prisoners of affluence
and indifference.''
   ``God has ordained governments to be instruments of hope,'' he
said. ``In God we trust, but in governments we hope.''

<HEAD>50th Anniversary of World's Most Popular Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL WOODFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhett Butler is gone and Tara's a mess, but
Scarlett O'Hara still knows one thing: ``Tomorrow is another day.''
   ``Gone With the Wind'' was a mess, too, but David O. Selznick's
blockbuster _ the world's most popular film _ has been restored and
will rise yet again this month for a 50th anniversary tour that's
already selling out theaters.
   Since its Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the popularity of the movie
based on Margaret Mitchell's novel about the Civil War and
Reconstruction has never faltered.
   It broke box-office records by grossing $14 million its first
year, and new generations flocked to carefully spaced reissues in
1947, 1954, 1961 and 1967. The 1976 television debut was the largest
audience ever to tune in for a theatrical feature, with 33.9 million
homes watching. The film has so far grossed $76.7 million at the box
office, and had been the No. 1 top-grossing movie until ``The Sound
of Music'' edged ahead in 1965.
   A widescreen version made in the 1960s turned ``Gone With the
Wind'' into a celluloid mess. The conversion ruined the color and
composition of the movie, which had been made in Technicolor.
Promoters say the newly restored version brings back the color and
majesty of the original.
   Television entrepreneur Ted Turner, who owns the film, is
planning a 42-city tour in American movie houses for the restored
print. The 3{-hour film, which won eight Academy Awards including
best picture, is already sold out, with tickets at $10 and $12.50
for the first showing Jan. 30-31 in New York City.
   The day of its premiere in 1939, the governor declared a holiday
and more than a million people crowded into downtown Atlanta as
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh led a parade of stars down Peachtree
Street to Loew's Grand Theater, which was decked out with a white
marble facade reminiscent of Tara, Scarlett's plantation. They were
celebrating the film version of a hometown writer's Pulitzer
Prize-winning epic.
   Turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought
MGM-UA Entertainment Corp. with its massive film library for $1.5
billion. He daily began showing the David O. Selznick blockbuster in
1987 at one of the six theaters at CNN Center, the headquarters of
his cable-TV empire; a shop in the atrium offers ``GWTW''
memorabilia. He also launched his 24-hour TV channel, Turner Network
Television, with _ you guessed it _ ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``It's his favorite movie,'' said Turner Broadcasting System
spokesman Frank Miller, so Turner was ``only too happy'' to foot the
$250,000 bill for the complex restoration process using the original
negatives.
   ``The situation before was that they were making prints from
masters that were several stages removed from the original
negatives,'' Miller said. ``There were prints floating around that
were four or five generations removed.''
   For the restored version, Turner obtained every bit of negative
he could in the best possible condition from Eastman House in
Rochester, N.Y., and then printed ``under optimal conditions,'' he
said.
   ``What really comes out is a better print than has ever been seen
before, even since '39. They (Selznick's crew) had wonderful
equipment for recording and sound, but not as good equipment for
printing it.''
   Also restored is the original ``sweep'' title, which moved across
the screen from right to left in the 1939 version. It had been
replaced by a block title, showing all four words at once, in
remakes during the 1960s.
   The anniversary celebration comes just one year before the
anticipated publication of the long-awaited sequel to Mitchell's
novel. After fighting for decades to keep others from continuing the
story of Scarlett and Rhett, the Mitchell estate authorized a sequel
in 1987 and last year chose Alexandra Ripley, a Virginia author, to
write it.
   Warner Books paid $4.94 million for the rights to publish the
sequel.
   Turner's staff is putting together events to celebrate the film's
50th anniversary in December.
   ``There will be a ball of some kind'' in Atlanta, Miller said,
``but it's not for sure right now what exactly is going to be done.''
   Until Turner bought the rights, Atlanta had few permanent
reminders that it was the home of Mitchell, who won a Pulitzer Prize
for the 1936 novel that has sold 25 million copies. Efforts to save
the apartment where she wrote much of the book are tied up in court.
The Loew's, which opened as an opera house in 1892, was gutted by
fire in 1978.
   The restored version of ``GWTW'' will be available on
videocassette for home use, as will a TBS documentary, ``The Making
of a Legend: Gone With the Wind,'' which was produced by Selznick's
sons, L. Jeffrey and Daniel Selznick.
   The original was released on videocassette in 1985, and has sold
more than 500,000 copies at $89.95 each in the United States with
similar sales overseas. Initially, 29,000 copies had to be destroyed
because they opened with 45 seconds of the wrong music _ a strident
marching song. The videos were later re-released with the correct
tune, ``Dixie.''

<HEAD>1939 Was a Vintage Year for Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1939, as Britain and France challenged the
German war machine, and Admiral Richard Byrd made his third
expedition to the icy vastness of Antarctica, America went to the
movies.
   And oh, what movies they were.
   Never had Hollywood seen such a single year, a year bursting with
delicious and memorable screen treats, including ``Gone With the
Wind,'' ``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Wuthering Heights'' and ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington.'' It was like dropping a starving child in the
middle of an ice cream jungle with 26 flavors dangling from vines.
   There was John Wayne riding tall in ``Stagecoach,'' his first
major feature. Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon left audiences
breathless as Heathcliff and Cathy in ``Wuthering Heights.'' They
were ``torn with desire'' and ``twisted with hate!'' Robert Donat
played the shy schoolmaster in the sloshy and sentimental ``Goodbye,
Mr. Chips,'' with Greer Garson in her screen debut.
   Meanwhile, James Stewart tried to inject intelligence, decency
and some good old common sense into Congress in Frank Capra's ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington.'' (Smith: ``I wouldn't give you two cents
for all your fancy rules if behind them they didn't have a little
bit of plain, ordinary kindness and a little looking out for the
other fella.'')
   And there was the timeless fantasy, ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which
has touched practically every child in America. It was directed by
Victor Fleming, who also was a director on 1939's most spectacular
movie, and indeed, one of the most popular films of all time, ``Gone
With the Wind,'' which won eight Academy Awards.
   It was a time when more than 50 percent of the population
regularly went to the cinema, and more than 500 pictures came out
each year. It was a time when Americans talked about going to ``the
movies.'' Today, one goes to see _ with any luck _ ``a movie.'' And
that one movie might be only 90 minutes long and not very good.
   In 1939, when the studio system was at its height, churning out
motion pictures to satisfy a moviegoing public, magic came to
Hollywood. How such grand movies all came out at the same time and
managed to survive the years and become among the best ever made is
as magical as Dorothy's trip to Oz.
   Bette Davis had four hits that year: ``Juarez,'' with Paul Muni,
Claude Rains and John Garfield; ``The Old Maid,'' with Miriam
Hopkins and George Brent; ``The Private Lives of Elizabeth and
Essex,'' with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland; and the
three-hanky ``Dark Victory,'' with George Brent and Humphrey Bogart.
   She received an Oscar nomination for her role in the last of
these as Judith, the society girl who is dying of a brain tumor:
``Nothing can hurt us now. What we have can't be destroyed. That's
our victory _ our victory over the dark. It is a victory because
we're not afraid.''
   ``The Women,'' based on Clare Booth Luce's stage comedy, featured
an all-female cast which included Rosalind Russell, Joan Crawford,
Norma Shearer, Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard.
   Other star vehicles included Greta Garbo in the Ernst Lubitsch
sparkling confection, ``Ninotchka.'' The comedy was a departure for
the oh-so-serious Garbo and one studio hypesters proclaimed, ``Garbo
laughs!''
   The leggy and sultry Marlene Dietrich changed Westerns forever in
``Destry Rides Again.'' Said one critic: ``Marlene Dietrich standing
on a bar in black net stockings belting out `See What the Boys in
the Back Room Will Have' was a greater work of art than the Venus de
Milo.''
   Somewhat less flashy _ and fleshy _ was Irene Dunne in the
romance, ``Love Affair,'' with Charles Boyer; Edna May Oliver in
``Drums Along the Mohawk''; the Hal Roach production of John
Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men,'' with Burgess Meredith and Lon
Chaney Jr.; Gary Cooper, David Niven and Broderick Crawford in ``The
Real Glory,'' a tale of soldiers of fortune; and George Steven's
treatment of the Rudyard Kipling poem, ``Gunga Din.'' Cary Grant,
Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. starred as ``the stalwart,
lusty, swaggering sergeants three.''
   The year gave film fans ``Babes in Arms,'' ``Intermezzo,'' ``Beau
Geste,'' ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' ``The Man in the Iron
Mask'' and ``The Rains Came,'' an almost forgotten disaster
spectacular set in India during the days of the Raj. It starred
Myrna Loy, Tyrone Powell and George Brent and received an Oscar
nomination for Alfred Newman's musical score.
   Finally, it was another grand year for those classic clowns, Stan
Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Their Hal Roach romp, ``Chump at Oxford,''
had some of the most memorable comic bits in Hollywood history: the
butler and maid routine and Laurel's impersonation of Lord
Paddington.

<HEAD>Groucho As Rhett and Other Important Factoids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rhett Butler with a wide, painted-on mustache,
meandering eyebrows, eye glasses and a cigar?
   Well, if author Margaret Mitchell had her way and had been really
serious about it, it would have been Groucho Marx who swept Miss
Scarlett up all those stairs for a taste of Southern lust instead of
Clark Gable.
   With all the Hollywood hype to recruit stars for ``Gone With the
Wind,'' Mitchell, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller,
kept her distance because she feared fellow Southerners would blame
her if the movie didn't turn out well. She didn't want to help write
the script, wouldn't participate in the casting search for stars and
finally coughed up her own candidate: the ribald comic.
   As one of the most popular movies of all time, ``Gone With the
Wind'' is awash with such nuggets.
   Did you know, for example, that the winner of eight Academy
Awards was panned by some critics?
   ``A major event in the history of the industry but only a minor
event in motion picture art. There are moments when the two
categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are
filled with mere spectacular efficiency,'' wrote Franz Hoellering in
The Nation.
   ``Shakespeare's `The Taming of the Shrew' seems to have gotten
mixed up with one of the novels of Ethel M. Dell,'' wrote James
Agate.
   Here are some other ``Gone With the Wind'' factoids:
   _ Two soundtracks were released with the 1939 film _ one for
domestic distribution and one for overseas. In the international
version there was strident marching music and the visual was an
elaborate description of the North-South conflict. The domestic
version had a sweet version of ``Dixie'' and talked about the
halcyon days in the South that are gone with the wind.
   _ With all the Oscars the movie copped, there was one significant
omission: Clark Gable. He lost out to Robert Donat for his
performance in ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.''
   _ Hattie McDaniel, who won an Academy Award for supporting
actress for her role as the maid Mammy, kept her long, manicured
fingernails in the movie as her own way of protesting the treatment
of blacks in Hollywood. She was not, she wanted the world to know, a
maid. She was the first black actor ever nominated for an Oscar and
the first to ever win.
   _ Vivien Leigh refused to have any embraces with Gable when they
first began shooting the movie because of a foul mouth odor caused
by his dentures. He eventually remedied the problem.
   _ Cammie King Conlon, who portrayed Bonnie Blue, Rhett and
Scarlett's little girl, couldn't stop blinking while playing dead so
a mask of her face was made and used over her real face. Also, it
wasn't the actress who fell from the pony but a midget. And a
blue-eyed boy played Bonnie Blue as an infant.
   _ Scenes of the Tara plantation and the burning of Atlanta were
filmed at the backlot of Laird Studios in downtown Culver City,
Calif.
   _ Walter Plunkett, the movie's costume designer, was given a box
of thorns by a woman in Charleston, S.C., because during the Civil
War, there were no metal pins and clothing was held together by the
thorns.
   _ The structure which collapses in flames during the burning of
Atlanta had also been the Temple of Jerusalem in ``King of Kings''
and the native village in ``King Kong.''
   _ George Cukor began as director of the movie but Clark Gable
complained that he favored the female actresses. Sam Wood and
William Cameron Menzies also had directorial stints on the epic. But
it was Victor Fleming who ultimately got the main credit and the
Oscar for best director.
   _ The film rights for the blockbuster were purchased for a mere
$50,000 in 1936.
   _ Paulette Goddard was Selznick's first choice for Scarlett. But
he feared her attachment to Charlie Chaplin would be bad publicity.
She and Chaplin later married.
   _ Leslie Howard only agreed to appear in the movie as the wimpy
Ashley Wilkes after Selznick agreed to make him associate producer
on ``Intermezzo,'' Ingrid Bergman's first Hollywood film.
   _ The Ocala, Fla., chapter of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy protested the casting of Vivien Leigh, who was British,
as the Southern heroine.
   _ Irving Thalberg, who directed MGM production under studio head
Louis B. Mayer, didn't think ``Gone With the Wind'' stood a chance
at the box office. Said he to Louis B., ``Forget it, Louis. No Civil
War picture ever made a nickel.''
   The movie went on to break box office records its first year by
grossing $14 million.

<HEAD>Tiny Swamp Town Fighting Closure Of School, Center Of Community Life</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FARGO, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people of this swampside settlement have
shunned formal government since the days when it was a logging camp,
taking their problems and projects instead to town meetings at the
schoolhouse.
   The school has held the town together, but now it appears headed
for closure and residents fear its demise will mean the end of Fargo
just when the community is on the rebound.
   The 250 or so residents are taking on the Georgia Department of
Education to try to keep the state's smallest elementary school
open. The odds aren't great, but the odds have been bad before and
Fargo is still on most maps.
   ``Fargo is a can-do town, it's the way towns used to be,'' said
Bill Oettmeier, a native son.
   ``It might take an act of Congress to keep our school. And
there's not but 58 (students) and we know that. But if we lose the
school, it won't be our fault,'' said Rosemary Leviton, a school
board member.
   Fargo lies on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp, just where the
Suwanee River _ THE Suwanee River _ crawls out of the bog and heads
south in no great hurry past Stephen Foster State Park. The
songwriter who made the river famous, people in Fargo say,
apparently never laid eyes on it.
   Not that there's much to see.
   Georgia Highway 89 barely slows down through the cluster of
modest homes and small stores. Unincorporated since it was a logging
camp at the turn of the century, Fargo has had little to do with
governments _ residents often pass the hat when the town needs
something _ and governments have returned the favor.
   Nothing but pine trees will grow in the sandy, acid soil around
the Okefenokee where a ``hill'' is any land with no standing water
on it. In a disastrous fire 33 years ago, tens of thousands of acres
of pines burned. But the trees were replanted and are becoming
marketable. Now there is serious talk of a new mill, of more jobs so
more people can stay in Fargo.
   ``We've spent 33 years trying to come back and the QBE is hitting
this little place in the head just when it's trying to recover,''
said Oettmeier, president of Superior Pine, which leases more than
200,000 acres of pine around Fargo to Champion Lumber Co.
   Under Georgia's Quality Basic Education law, a reform package
passed by the Legislature in 1985, smaller school districts are
being encouraged to consolidate isolated schools.
   The Fargo school was built in 1952 for several times the current
enrollment. But as loggers cut the trees the fire missed, people
began to dribble out of Fargo. Clinch County operates the school,
with its six teachers and one principal, on the $200,000 a year it
gets in state ``sparsity grants.''
   As things stand, that will be cut in half next year and then end.
Fargo, the state has decided, doesn't qualify for the grants, though
for some children who live in its outer reaches the round trip to
school in Homerville will mean nearly 100 miles a day on a school
bus.
   Don Thornhill, director of facilities and transportation for the
Georgia Board of Education, said that to qualify there must be no
way the schools can be consolidated. Only a few meet that standard,
he said, and consolidation is becoming common across rural Georgia.
   If the grant stops, it will be up to Clinch County to decide
whether to consolidate or use local funds to keep the school open.
   ``That is not really within the realm of possibilities,'' said
county School Superintendent Tommy Lee. ``This is a rural county
that is losing jobs and losing people and for us to take over the
cost is out of the question.''
   Clinch County raises less than a quarter of its annual $4.7
million school budget locally. It would have to raise local school
taxes by some 25 percent to handle the $200,000 annual Fargo costs.
   Lee said the concern over Fargo's fate is very real, ``but the
board of education's primary function is to educate children, not
preserve towns.''
   ``If there is no school, (the lumber company) is going to want to
know about it now,'' Oettmeier said. ``They're not going to build a
$40 million mill where nobody wants to work and live.''
   Town leaders are lobbying state officials to try to keep the
funding that will let the school remain open, and say they have some
support. It may not be enough, many in Fargo realize, to save a way
of life they cherish.
   At the school, kids don't lock their bikes. If a kid rode down
the street on somebody else's bike, the whole town would know. On a
recent afternoon dogs waited outside a classroom for their young
owners, and if one poked a nose in an open doorway, that was OK. In
Fargo, people know whose dog is whose.
   Fargo residents say it is this closeness and tranquility that
makes them want to stay, raise families and pursue values that are
endangered elsewhere, even if they have to travel 28 miles to the
nearest pharmacy and most go to Valdosta, 50 miles west, to see a
doctor or dentist.
   For a time the nearest fire engine was in Homerville, so Fargo
residents raised the money themselves to refurbish an old, donated
engine. They passed the hat to air-condition the school and to build
a ballpark, complete with lights. Homerville teams played night
games in Fargo while waiting for a government grant to get a lighted
park of their own, Oettmeier notes.
   Danny Ellis, 25, who returned to his hometown to teach
kindergarten and first grade, said all the town's activities are
centered at the school. ``The senior citizens have their programs
here, the first aid and first response groups meet here. So do the
Boy Scouts and the PTA.''
   The school hosts the community Christmas program. Gift baskets
are distributed from the school to the less fortunate.
   ``It all happens from the school,'' Ellis said. ``If the school
closes, the town will close.''

   The stock market surged broadly higher Tuesday,
pushing the Dow Jones industrial average for the first time back to
the levels it held just before the October 1987 market crash.
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks finished up 38.04 points
at 2,256.43.
   It was the highest close for the widely followed market indicator
since it finished at 2,246.73 on Oct. 16, 1987, the last session
before the infamous Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, when the average
plummeted an unprecedented 508 points in a single day.
   Market watchers said investor optimism about the outlook for
interest rates fueled Tuesday's rally, which followed a 17-point
drop in the Dow average on Monday.
   Analysts said investors were reassured by comments from Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said he was satisfied
with Fed policy to keep interest rates on the tight side in order to
hold down inflation. In the long run, analysts said, that policy
could prevent a sustained bout of higher rates.
   Stocks also were supported by rises in the dollar and bond
prices, market watchers said.

   The government has filed formal fraud charges
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment giant that

million in fines and restitution.
   The procedure Tuesday at Manhattan federal court marked the first

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
has told Congress unless economic growth slows, the nation ``would

   Greenspan, testifying before the House Banking Committee on

to grow at a strong pace last year without a flare-up of inflation,
but mounting pressures on prices will keep the central bank's
monetary policy on the tight side.

1987, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. Inflation averaged 4.4

   A month after Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed
to plead guilty to felony charges, federal prosecutors have revealed
the allegations include crooked dealings with disgraced stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky and a defunct securities firm.
   But the disclosure of the six specific mail and securities fraud
counts Tuesday still leaves unanswered questions:
   _What will be required of the investment giant to keep its plea
bargain, which includes an agreement to pay a records $650 million
in fines and restitution;
   _When will Drexel actually plead guilty, and
   _What effect will the agreement have on the fate of Drexel's
embattled ``junk bond'' chief, Michael Milken.
   The charges against Drexel were revealed in a court document
known as an information, which is presented to a judge or magistrate
when a defendant agrees to waive indictment and settle a case
without going to trial.
   A lawyer for Drexel entered a ``not guilty'' plea before U.S.
Magistrate Nina Gershon, because only a judge can take a guilty plea
to a felony.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said Drexel's guilty plea would
not come until after the settlement is approved by the Justice
Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Key details of the settlement spelling out Drexel's
responsibilities concerning cooperation with investigators and other
issues was kept under seal at Drexel's request, however.
   Giuliani said he believed the public had a right to know details
of the agreement and he would ask a federal judge to unseal details
of the settlement at a closed hearing today.
   ``I cannot answer for Drexel why they want to keep it under
seal,'' said Giuliani, who added: ``the public in general, but in
particular, the investing public, is entitled to the facts about the
case.''
   In a statement, Drexel said it ``will not comment further
regarding other criminal allegations that have been a part of the
U.S. attorney's investigation.''
   The government accused Drexel of criminal acts ranging from
insider trading to stock manipulation involving some recent major
takeover targets as well as Boesky and Princeton-Newport Partners,
which liquidated after five of its top officials were indicted last
year on racketeering charges.
   In all, there were four counts of securities fraud and two of
mail fraud in the information.
   ``There are no specific insider trading charges among the six
counts enumerated,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll,
``but the information does describe the course of conduct between
Drexel and the Boesky organization and Drexel and the
Princeton-Newport organization and in connection with them, the
information does allege insider trading.''
   Some of the charges also implicated a senior employee at Drexel's
High Yield and Convertible Bond Department in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
identified only as ``John Doe.''
   Giuliani said he was ``not permitted'' by federal rules to
identify the individual.
   People familiar with the case concluded the employee was Milken,
Drexel's senior junk bond financier who is expected to be indicted
shortly on fraud and racketeering charges.
   Giuliani declined to comment on any possible charges facing
Milken, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong.
   Five of the charges in the criminal case mirrored accusations in
a civil case leveled against the firm and Milken in September by the
SEC, which said they schemed with Boesky, the now-imprisoned stock
speculator who has snitched on many prominent securities figures in
exchange for lenient treatment.
   The sixth charge involved a transaction that allegedly defrauded
a Drexel client.
   ``Drexel manipulated securities prices, engaged in insider
trading and unlawfully facilitated merger and acquisition
activities,'' said a statement from Giuliani's office.
   ``Today's filing of an information charging Drexel Burnham
Lambert is in accordance with the preliminary agreement reached with
the United States Attorney on Dec. 21, 1988,'' said Drexel's
statement. ``We believe that this settlement is in the best
interests of our firm, its employees and clients.''
   The statement also said the settlement, when final, ``will
protect Drexel from further prosecution relating to the matters
which are part of the U.S. attorney's office's continuing
investigation.''
   The charges accused Drexel of mail fraud and securities fraud in
connection with takeover-related transactions that included targets
Fischbach Corp., MCA Inc., Harris Graphics Corp., Phillips Petroleum
Co. and Stone Container Corp.
   The firm also was accused of fraud in connection with a
transaction in which the government said it conspired with
Princeton-Newport to cheat a Drexel client, C.O.M.B. Co.
   Drexel is the fifth-largest Wall Street firm and one of the most
profitable investment concerns in the country. It is a leader in the
$175 billion market for ``junk bond'' securities, often used to
finance takeovers and the growth of small to medium sized companies.
   The firm and Milken were implicated in extensive wrongdoing by
Boesky after he turned state's evidence in late 1986. In December,
Drexel began negotiating a plea deal with Giuliani's office in order
to avoid crippling charges of racketeering. Milken continues to
maintain his innocence.

   Companies making cars and light trucks in the
United States reported sales dropped 11.5 percent in mid-January
compared with unusually strong results last year.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. all
reported double-digit sales declines, led by GM's 21.9 percent drop
and followed by Ford's 13.6 percent decline and Chrysler's 10
percent fall.
   The seven companies making cars in this country reported Tuesday
they sold vehicles at a daily rate of 28,584 during the Jan. 11-20
period this year compared with an average daily rate of 32,292
during the same time last year.

York.
   ``Last January was the highest seasonally adjusted (sales) rate
in the last 20 years,'' she said. ``And it will continue into
February, too.''
   During the first part of last year, automakers were worried about
the fallout from the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. To bolster
sales, they put incentives on their vehicles, a move that may have
proven unnecessary.
   ``The automakers didn't really realize that the underlying demand
was there,'' Heaney said. ``So, consumers were going to buy anyway
and then the incentives pushed them up more.''
   The U.S. automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of 17,330
during the period this year, compared with a daily rate of 20,709
during the same time last year. There were nine selling days in both
periods.
   Sales of U.S.-made light trucks dropped 2.8 percent in
mid-January to a daily rate of 11,254 from a rate of 11,583 during
the same time last year.
   During the first two 10-day periods this year, sales of U.S.-made
cars and light trucks were down 5.2 percent, to a daily rate of
27,288 from a rate of 28,775 last year. There were 16 sales days in
both periods.
   Among the Big Three U.S. automakers, GM car sales dropped 21.9
percent in mid-January to a daily rate of 7,861 from a 10,066 rate
during the same period last year. GM's light trucks sold at a 4,306
daily rate during the Jan. 11-20 period this year, down 4 percent
from 4,488 daily during the same time last year.
   Ford Motor Co. cars sold at a daily rate of 5,842 during the
period this year, down 13.6 from a rate of 6,766 last year. Ford
light trucks sold at a rate of 3,968 during mid-January this year,
down 5.5 percent from a rate of 4,202 during the period last year.
   Cars sales by Chrysler Corp. dropped 10 percent during
mid-January this year, to a daily rate of 2,462 from a rate of 2,736
last year. Light trucks sold at a daily rate of 2,634 this year, up
0.8 percent from the 2,613 rate during the period last year.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for the second period of January 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days
last year.
   For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 16
selling days this year and 16 selling days last year, and for the
year so far, 16 selling days this year and 16 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Cellular Phone Industry Settles Disagreement Over Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The booming cellular phone industry has settled
on a transmission standard for the future that should keep the
airwaves from getting clogged with busy signals.
   The agreement, announced on Tuesday, sets a standard for the
digital cellular phones that are expected to begin appearing in
1991. A digital system can handle many more calls in the limited
frequency band that is available because calls can be ``compressed''
by computers.
   At a meeting in San Antonio, the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association said its board of directors had on Monday
unanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by the
standard-setting Telecommunications Industry Association.
   Cellular phones, typically used in cars, are actually radio
receivers and transmitters. Calls are sent to central offices, where
they plug into the regular phone network. Los Angeles and New York
are already running up against capacity with the current system.
   In addition to providing more capacity, a digital system will be
more secure because calls will be harder to intercept. Initially it
will be more expensive, but costs will come down because of the
greater efficiency of digital technology.
   The standards setters agreed that digital calls would be funneled
onto channels using a technique known as time-division multiplexing.
   The alternative standard, which had been supported by Motorola
Inc. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., is known as frequency
division multiplexing. The standards setters decided that
time-division multiplexing had more potential for future growth.
   Although the decision went against them, Motorola and AT&amp;T said
they were pleased with the agreement because it would allow the
industry to move forward.
   ``We feel that this is a very positive step,'' said Jerry Wilson,
a Motorola spokesman.
   Several other decisions on standards remain to be made, but this
was a major one.
   ``This decision needed to be made before any other decisions
could be made in the digital standards process,'' Lynne Rose, a
spokeswoman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
   The voting members of her association are operators of cellular
phone systems. The standard-setting Telecommunications Industry
Association, in contrast, comprises both system operators and
equipment manufacturers.

<HEAD>Polaroid Rejects Shamrock's $45-a-Share Offer; Proxy Fight Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stage is set for Shamrock Holdings to
wage a proxy fight for control of Polaroid Corp. after the camera
maker rejected Shamrock's $3.2 billion buyout bid, calling it
indadequate.
   The uninvited bid turned down Tuesday was made last week when
Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E. Disney
family, raised its offer to $45 per share for all Polaroid stock,
including 9.7 million shares issued under Polaroid's employee stock
ownership plan.
   The previous offer of $2.6 billion, or $42 per share, did not
include the employee shares.
   In a statement, Polaroid called the latest sweetened offer
``inadequate from a financial point of view and not in the best
interest of Polaroid and its stockholders, except Shamrock and its
affiliate.''
   ``Polaroid's board strongly recommends that stockholders reject
the Shamrock offer and not tender any of their shares of common
stock,'' Polaroid stated.
   On Tuesday, Polaroid stock rose 12{ cents a share to $40 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Tom Reed, a Shamrock spokesman, said the Burbank, Calif.-based
company would proceed with its plan to nominate a slate of
candidates for election to Polaroid's board at the company's annual
meeting May 9.
   If elected, Shamrock's candidates would be committed to selling
the company either under Shamrock's offer or to any third party who
made a higher bid.
   Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold said he was disappointed by
Polaroid's rejection of Shamrock's $45 per share offer.
   In a prepared statement issued from Burbank, Gold said: ``We
intend to vigorously pursue our tender offer and our previously
announced plans to wage a proxy contest for control of Polaroid if
our tender offer is not consummated prior to Polaroid's May annual
meeting.''
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips declined comment on
Shamrock's proposed proxy challenge.
   Shamrock said when it extended its offer Jan. 19 that about 13.1
million Polaroid shares, or 18.3 percent of the outstanding stock,
had been tendered and not withdrawn.
   Shamrock's tender offer expires March 15, and is contingent on
obtaining at least 90 percent of Polaroid's 71.6 million outstanding
shares.
   Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.,
said Polaroid's management could be forced into a leveraged buyout
to thwart Shamrock's takeover attempt. In a leveraged buyout, a
group usually finances its bid by borrowing heavily against the
assets of the company being acquired.
   ``My guess is that the next time Shamrock is forced to extend its
offer, that the number of tendered shares will probably move up to
close to 25 million,'' he said.
   Henderson said 25 million tendered shares, nearly 35 percent of
the outstanding shares, combined with the 6.9 million Shamrock
already holds could frighten Polaroid executives into financing a
leveraged buyout to avoid having sell the company to Shamrock.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock since July, when Shamrock
offered $40 per share in a friendly but unsolicited bid.
   Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware and Shamrock is appealing a
Delaware Chancery Court ruling upholding the employee stock
ownership plan. The Delaware Supreme Court has scheduled a March 16
hearing on the appeal.
   Shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a
takeover. If it is invalidated, Shamrock has promised to raise its
offer to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.
   The stock plan owns about 14 percent of Polaroid's stock. It
makes a takeover extremely difficult because under Delaware law, a
hostile suitor must gain at least 85 percent of its target to
proceed with a takeover.

<HEAD>Greenspan Comments Boost Stock Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: May be led with existing home sales reports scheduled for mid-morning
release.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says the risk of
inflation is great enough to keep boosting interest rates to
restrict growth, and his comments were credited with helping fuel
rallies in stocks and bonds.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.04 points on Tuesday to
finish at 2,256.43, closing above its pre-Black Monday level for the
first time since the October 1987 crash.
   After closing at 2,246.74 on Oct. 16, 1987, the Dow Jones
industrials lost an unprecedented 508 points in the Black Monday
market collapse on Oct. 19.
   Testifying before the House Banking Committee on Tuesday,
Greenspan warned that strains on factory capacity and a tight labor
market, particularly in the Northeast, likely would keep inflation
pressures high, so the central bank's monetary policy should
continue on the tight side.
   ``The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation, and the
risks of this occurring under current circumstances, are
sufficiently great that Federal Reserve policy at this juncture
might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness
than of stimulus,'' he said.
   Greenspan told Congress he wants to keep a lid on economic growth
and continue to slowly boost interest rates to avoid higher
inflation, which was 4.4 percent in 1988.
   The Labor Department, meanwhile, reported that wage gains of 4.1
percent last year lagged behind inflation rate while employment
costs, at 5 percent, rose faster than inflation.
   Wage and salary gains are closely watched as signals of a
possible inflationary spiral. The increase for 1988 was much closer
to inflation than the 3.3 percent wage hike reported for 1987.
   The Labor Department figures indicated that continued low
unemployment has forced employers to compete for available workers,
often by increasing pay.
   Greenspan said the unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in December,
has hit a 14-year low, well within the range of what most economists
consider to be the natural rate of unemployment, leaving little room
for further improvement without inflation.
   In other economic news Tuesday, automakers reported that sales of
U.S.-made cars in mid-January plummeted 16.3 percent _ led by
General Motors Corp.'s 21.9 percent decline _ from a relatively
strong year-earlier period.
   A year ago, automakers were offering some buyer incentives amid
continued uneasiness about the strength of the automobile market
following the stock market crash. Eventually, the concern about the
market proved to be unwarranted as automakers posted the third-best
model year in history in 1988.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Up Against Yen, Stocks Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher today against the
Japanese yen, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index inched up
to another record high.
   The dollar ended at 127.65 yen, up 0.70 yen from Tuesday's 126.95
yen close. It opened at 127.86 yen and ranged between 127.37 and
127.88 yen.
   The dollar's higher opening followed a remark Tuesday by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that he would tighten
monetary policy to fight inflation.
   After buying the dollar in early trading, speculative investors
then started selling the currency for position adjustments, said
Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa Bank.
   ``We already knew that the United States would tighten its
monetary policy and keep interest rates high, but Greenspan's
comment still prompted the buying because Japanese investors have
been looking for market-affecting incentives,'' he added.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar more
attractive to foreign investors.
   Other dealers said investors were reluctant to push the dollar
higher for fear of another round of dollar-selling intervention by
central banks.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at
31,567.79, a new high just 10.11 points, or 0.03 percent, higher
than the previous record of 31,557.68, set on Tuesday.
   The index's rally in early trading followed rising prices on
overseas markets overnight. It began falling as investors grew
concerned about the index's rapid increase, but managed to keep the
marginal gain, said a dealer with Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
   Trading became directionless as investors floated from one issue
to another while trying to keep the index from rising too high, said
the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Investors are expecting the Nikkei to rise continuously, but
they get cautious if prices rise too quickly,'' the dealer said.
   He predicted that the Nikkei would continue upward in view of
recent stability in foreign exchange rates and oil prices.

   The U.S. dollar edged up against most major
currencies in light European trading early today, spurred by Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's declaration to fight
inflation.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar's surge could prompt renewed
dollar-selling by central banks, and said fear of intervention was
already preventing the dollar from rising faster.
   ``The market is waiting to see whether the central banks come
in,'' said a dealer at a bank in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Greenspan told Congress on Tuesday that the risks of inflation
were great enough that the Fed ``might well be advised to err more
on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.70 Japanese yen to a closing 127.65 yen. Later, in
London, it slipped back to 127.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8414 West German marks, up from 1.8395; 1.5640
Swiss francs, up from 1.5523; 6.2660 French francs, up from 6.2335;
2.0760 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,347.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,340.50; 1.1828 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7710 from $1.7700 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $404.80 a troy ounce,
down from $407 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $404.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $404.60, down from $407.10 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.42 to close at a bid $406.57.
   Silver fell sharply in London to a bid price of $6.12 a troy
ounce, down from $6.21 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Exchange Says It Won't Tolerate Corruption; Grand Jury Assembled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade, one of two exchanges
targeted in a federal probe of corruption in the pits, issued a
warning against rules violations to members and traders as many were
summoned before a grand jury.
   Top officials at the exchange distributed a letter Tuesday
saying, ``We will never tolerate violations of our rules and
regulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those who have
broken our rules.''
   The BOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange _ the nation's
largest commodities exchanges _ are at the center of an
investigation into allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders
cheated customers out of millions of dollars.
   FBI agents posing as traders wore hidden tape recorders to
document alleged wrongdoing in the crowded, frantic trading pits.
   Illinois Farm Bureau President John White Jr. warned Tuesday of
serious consequences from the two-year investigation.
   ``These are not just Chicago markets _ these are world markets
and these are my markets,'' White, a Kane County grain farmer, said
in a telephone news conference.
   ``The public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges
are working honestly and in an open environment.''
   The FBI on Tuesday subpoenaed clearing firms that serve the
exchanges, while a federal grand jury was assembled to begin hearing
testimony from traders subpoenaed last week, according to defense
attorneys.
   The Chicago Tribune said at least 200 subpoenas were issued as
part of ``Operation Sourmash,'' and some of the recipients were:
David H. Horberg, a former co-head of the Merc's powerful yen
futures committee; James Nowak, a major soybean broker; and Martin
Dempsey, a soybean trader who sold his BOT seat last week for
$415,000.
   Subpoenas were also delivered to Continental Illinois Corp. of
Chicago, which owns Capital First Options Inc., and J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co. of New York, the Tribune said.
   ``I hope it's only a fishing expedition,'' said John Sandner,
chief executive officer of RB&amp;H Inc., which also was served. ``I
would not want to believe there's such widespread corruption that
would require such a widespread investigation.''
   U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas and FBI officials declined to
comment on the latest developments.
   Clearing firms, which must own seats to do business, are among
the exchange's largest members. They have authority to handle retail
orders and contract out the physical trading of those orders in the
pit to independent traders, also known as locals.
   A Merc spokeswoman, Julie Jacobs, said exchange officials had no
idea how many of the exchange's 81 clearing firms were subpoenaed.
   ``Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials were informed that many
of the CME clearing member firms have been served with subpoenas to
provide various records relating to trading activity on the Chicago
Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,'' the Merc said.
   The statement said the subpoenas ``do not imply that the firms
... or their officers are targets of the investigation, or are
suspected of any wrongful actions.''
   The BOT and Merc are marketplaces in which buyers and sellers
essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of
financial instruments and commodities, such as Treasury bills or
soybeans.
   The Board of Trade's letter, signed by Karsten Mahlmann, chairman
of the board at the exchange, and Thomas R. Donovan, president and
chief executive officer, said:
   ``If any members have taken part in trading practices which are
illegal or violate our rules and regulations they are not
representative of the 3,500 members of the CBOT.''

   The National Economic Commission will be
remembered as a ``missed opportunity'' in deficit-reduction efforts
because it lacks the White House commitment necessary to negotiate a
settlement, a panel member says.
   ``I think it had the potential of being a worthwhile exercise
(but) I think up to now at least a couple of the essential
ingredients of an important role for the commission are lacking,''
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland said Tuesday.
   The panel has been meeting since last May and is scheduled to
submit a report to President Bush by March 1. Bush decided against
extending the deadline six months.
   ``The prospects of a unified report, I think, are doubtful but I
don't want to make any premature judgments,'' said Kirkland, one of
14 members of the panel.
   Missing, he said, was a commitment from the White House, and to a
lesser extent congressional leaders, that the commission's work
would be seriously considered and that the panel would be used as a
forum to find a compromise among various deficit-reduction proposals.
   Kirkland said such a commitment and a sense of urgency were
essential to the work of a 1982-83 commission that studied the
Social Security system. Kirkland also served on that panel.
   ``Those were the circumstances that I think were necessary for
this committee to serve its purpose,'' he said. ``They may yet
evolve, I don't write off that possibility, but as yet it's not
visible.''
   Asked who was to blame, Kirkland said:
   ``I would suppose if you want to lay it at the door of any one
factor it is the constraints that have been expressed by the
president, both before his election and since, as to the options
that were available to deal with the problem. ... He seems
preferenced to advance his own programs, his commitment to the
so-called flexible freeze.''
   Kirkland, during a meeting with reporters at his office, said
congressional leaders also have not given the commission the stature
it needs to convince the various interest groups involved in
deficit-reduction efforts to make concessions.
   ``Absent that, you see, members of the commission, certainly like
myself, find no real reason to yield on any of our positions,'' he
said. ``If there were serious negotiations with the major players
and the ultimate package or the ultimate shape of the resolution
were otherwise acceptable, as a citizen and as a patriot and as one
concerned with resolving it, I'd be disposed to go along with some
things that might otherwise prove distasteful.''

<HEAD>Trump Says Vic's is Tacky, Closing It Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trader Vic's, that citadel of ersatz Polynesian
cuisine whose defenders include former President Richard Nixon, has
gotten ``tacky'' and has no place in the Plaza Hotel, Plaza owner
Donald Trump says.
   Trump, who recently bought the Plaza, wants to revamp the hotel
into a five-star institution and says the restaurant _ with its
thatched roofs and dugout canoes _ ``does not fit in with the image
of the hotel I want to achieve.''
   So instead of a Polynesian-style bar where customers could order
a Samoan Fog Cutter or a Dr. Funk of Tahiti, there'll be a health
club and a restaurant serving Japanese and Chinese food.
   But, perhaps to console patrons who feel they've been forsaken,
there'll be a bar, run by Trump, that will serve tropical drinks.
   That's small consolation to such loyal patrons as Nixon, who
dined there while president in 1972.
   ``My entire family will be very sorry to see it close,'' Nixon
said Tuesday through a spokesman. ``It was always our daughters'
favorite restaurant, and it quickly became mine, too.''
   Trump, who bought the Plaza last year for $390 million, said
construction on the Oriental restaurant and the health club will
start in about three or four months.
   The restaurant section of Trader Vic's, which has been in the
Plaza basement for 25 years, has been closed for more than year. But
the bar has remained open.
   Clint Wade, a Trader Vic's spokesman, said the company wants to
run the new Oriental restaurant at the hotel but noted that Trump
has ``no intention of keeping Trader Vic's'' at the Plaza.
   ``The Trumps want to get a new looking restaurant and that is
also what we want,'' Wade said. ``Sure, Trader Vic's has gotten
tacky, but that's because nothing has been done to it in 12 years.''
   Trader Vic's, which began in San Francisco, still has more than
20 restaurants across the United States and in West Germany, Japan
and Canada, Wade said.

<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. of
Kirkland and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. have signed an
agreement that gives McCaw the federal government's
cellular-telephone business.
   The immediate impact of the AT&amp;T-McCaw subcontracting agreement
is likely to be small in financial terms at first, but could mean
big business if the federal government expands its use of cellular
phones.
   McCaw already is the nation's largest provider of cellular
service.
   The agreement comes under a contract awarded by the General
Services Administration last month to AT&amp;T for 60 percent of the
contract for the government's multibillion-dollar FTS-2000 network.
The new network will replace a 24-year-old federal
telecommunications system.
   ``Including cellular services in AT&amp;T's package would give the
government an excellent new wire-free communications technology,''
said Loren Kragh, a McCaw vice president. ``For the first time,
government personnel away from the office, on field assignments or
responding to emergencies will have continuous access'' to the
government phone system.
   If the government decides to make extensive use of cellular
telephones, ``it could be a great deal for McCaw,'' said Tom
Friedberg, an analyst for Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Seattle.
   McCaw, which has been aggressively buying cellular franchises in
major cities, already serves areas with populations totaling about
48 million people in 25 states.
   Last week, McCaw announced it will sell 22 percent of its stock
to British Telecom, Britain's largest telecommunications company,
for $1.5 billion.

<HEAD>Probe Shakes Confidence in Markets, Farm Leader Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Commodites Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Illinois Farm
Bureau, citing wavering confidence in the Chicago commodity markets,
is urging a speedy conclusion to an FBI probe of alleged fraud at
the city's two futures exchanges.
   John White Jr. warned of serious consequences from a prolonged
probe of allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange defrauded
customers of millions of dollars.
   ``These are not just Chicago markets _ these are world markets
and these are my markets,'' White, a Kane County grain farmer, said
Tuesday in a telephone news conference.
   ``The public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges
are working honestly and in an open environment,'' he said.
   Some grain and livestock farmers use the futures markets to
guarantee prices for the crops and herds they are raising by
entering into contracts for future delivery of their products at a
specified price. Futures prices also influence cash prices for the
commodities.
   White said confidence in the integrity of the futures industry
was crucial to farmers' participation in the markets. Farmers also
must have trust in the independent traders who create liquidity in
the market by accepting producers' risks in hope of making a profit.
   ``That confidence has been diminished by the current probe,''
White said. ``Our analysts feel that liquidity has already been
diminished.''
   He said it was too early to know whether the growing scandal had
set back the efforts of some farm leaders to encourage farmers to
use the futures markets.
   ``If the investigation uncovers a major violation, it's a major
setback,'' he said. ``If it turns out to be nitpicking ... I think
it would be a short-term thing that can be overcome.''

<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with two more resignations today. No

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita today rejected
opposition calls for him to quit after a third member of his Cabinet
resigned over links to a company at the center of a stock-trading
scandal.
   Also today, the Labor Ministry announced the resignations of its
two top bureaucrats who also have been linked to the company.
   Takeshita, scheduled to travel to Washington in a week for a
meeting with President Bush, was hit Tuesday with the resignation of
Ken Harada from the Cabinet post of director general of the Economic
Planning Agency.
   Harada, 69, had been appointed Dec. 27 when Takeshita brought 15
new faces into his scandal-plagued administration in an effort to
erase the taint of money links to the Recruit Co., an
information-based conglomerate.
   But Takeshita's justice minister, Takashi Hasegawa, resigned
after only three days and now Harada has quit. In the case of both
men, news reports had revealed that they continued to take political
donations from Recruit months after the scandal became front-page
news last summer.
   In December, Kiichi Miyazawa resigned as finance minister after
having repeatedly changed his story on how an aide used his name to
buy shares in the Recruit subsidiary.
   The largest opposition party, the Japan Socialist Party, ended
its three-day convention today with a resolution to try to force
Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party to hold new elections.
   Asked about opposition calls for him to resign and call early
elections, Takeshita told Japanese reporters: ``That's a matter for
me to judge.''
   He said he was ``resolved to cope'' with an expected difficult
legislature when the Diet, or parliament, convenes next month to
debate the government's proposed budget of $471.95 billion.
   Scandal has dogged the governing Liberal Democratic Party since
an ever-widening web of dubious money links began to emerge between
Recruit Co. and prominent people in politics, business and the news
media.
   The company had offered prelisted shares in a real-estate
subsidiary to the prominent people at bargain prices, and they
profited handsomely by selling after the shares went on the market
in October 1986.
   At least 16 top politicians, including some in opposition
parties, acknowledged that they or their aides benefited in such
deals.
   The transactions were not illegal under Japanese securities law.
But they raised suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling and
focused public attention on the close links between business and
politics.
   Further revelations have shown that Recruit also made regular
donations to many politicians. Several members of the serving
Cabinet have explained that they stopped accepting Recruit money
after the scandal broke.
   But the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported Tuesday that Harada had
received $80 a month from Recruit for 14 years until November, even
though he had become chairman of a special parliamentary committee
examining the Recruit scandal. The newspaper also reported that
Recruit bought $8,000 worth of tickets to a Harada fund-raising
party in August.
   In his resignation statement, Harada acknowledged receiving
donations but denied the company had sought any favors or that he
had done anything wrong.
   At the Labor Ministry today, Vice Labor Minister Yoshiro Okai and
Masayuki Nomiyama, director general of the Labor Standards Bureau,
resigned.
   Although both had acknowledged accepting favors from Recruit _
dinners in expensive restaurants and golf outings _ the ministry
said the resignations were routine personnel changes and not related
to the scandal.
   The Labor Ministry has responsibility for supervising Recruit's
major line of business in the personnel and employment-information
fields, and is being investigated by prosecutors for possible
bribery.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Up Half-Percent At Unisys; Prime, Apollo Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. said Wednesday it managed a
half-percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to end what it
called ``a tougher year than we and most of the industry originally
expected.''
   Among other computer makers, Prime Computer Inc. said it lost
money in the quarter because of a one-time charge, and Apollo
Computer Inc. said it managed a profit after two quarters of losses.
   Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer company, said its
quarterly earnings edged up to $218 million, or $1.05 per share,
from last year's figures of $216.9 million, or $1.09 per share.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was up slightly over the same period
last year _ to $2.87 billion from $2.8 billion.
   For all of 1988, Unisys said net income rose 18 percent to $680.6
million, or $3.27 per share, from last year's figure of $578
million, or $2.93 per share. Revenue rose to $9.9 billion for the
year from 1987's figure of $9.71 billion.
   Unisys, which has headquarters in Blue Bell, Pa., and Detroit,
said it expected its earnings in the current quarter ``will be very
weak'' because of lower production levels, inventory reduction
programs and the transition to a new line of mainframe computers.
   Prime, the Natick, Mass.-based minicomputer company, said a
pre-tax charge of $45 million in the fourth quarter produced a net
loss of 14.4 million, compared with a profit of $21.3 million, or 44
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 61 percent to $431
million from $267 million a year earlier because of the Feb. 5,
1988, acquisition of Computervision Corp.
   Prime's one-time charge covered costs for a reorganization and
cuts of 1,200 jobs as well as the expense of fighting off an ongoing
takeover attempt by MAI Basic Four Inc. Without the charge, earnings
would have been $18.4 million.
   For the full year, Prime said its earnings after the one-time
charge fell to $19 million, or 39 cents a share, from $64.8 million,
or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $1.59 billion
from $960 million.
   Apollo, the computer workstation maker based in Chelmsford,
Mass., said it earned $3.2 million, or 9 cents a share, in its
fourth quarter, helped by a $1.9 million gain on the repurchase of
debt. Although the earnings were off 68 percent from $10 million a
year earlier, they were a reversal of losses in the second and third
quarters. Revenue rose 13 percent to $184 million from $163 million.
   For the full year, Apollo said its earnings fell 90 percent to
$2.1 million, or 6 cents a share, from $20 million, or 56 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent to a record $654
million from $554 million.

<HEAD>Japanese Auto Production Reached Record 12.7 Million Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese automakers built a record 12.7 million
cars, trucks and buses in 1988, up 3.7 percent from the previous
year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association announced
Wednesday.
   The previous record, 12.3 million vehicles, was set in 1985.
Annual output declined since then due to the yen's sharp rise
against the U.S. dollar, making Japanese cars more expensive in the
United States. A soft American market also contributed to the
decline.
   Export figures for 1988, due for release next week, will show a
total of about 6 million vehicles, meaning a decline of 3.2 percent
from 1987, said the report.
   The association attributed the record-high 1988 production to
brisk domestic sales, which shot up 11 percent to a record 6.7
million vehicles. The strong domestic demand was a result of Japan's
steady economic growth and vigorous personal spending, it said.
   Toyota Motor Corp. last year again produced the largest number of
vehicles among 11 Japanese makers, nearly 4 million, up 9.1 percent
from 1987. Nissan Motor Co. was second, at nearly 2.2 million, down
2.8 percent.
   Total passenger car production last year increased 3.9 percent to
a record 8.2 million, while 4.4 million trucks, up 3.2 percent, and
57,000 buses, up 14.9 percent, were built, it said.

   The stock market was mixed today, pausing after
Tuesday's runup to its highest level since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.04 points on
Tuesday, slipped back 1.61 to 2,254.82 in the first half hour today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 549 up, 404 down and

   Volume on the Big Board came to 29.70 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market lately has appeared to be emerging from
the long shadow cast by the crash.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest
level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a
big step in that direction.
   The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign
exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market.
   With all that, however, brokers said there remained many
skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase
after stocks at their current levels.

   Share prices were higher in active trading at
midday Wednesday, although off the best levels, amid what dealers
called a renewed confidence in financial markets.
   Shares bounded 26 points higher at the opening, on a combination
of bullish sentiment from Wall Street's 38-point surge Tuesday, a
perception that British interest rates might fall before the March
14 budget and a perception that U.S. President George Bush might be
more successful than originally thought in tackling the U.S. budget
deficit.
   In addition, dealers said a large program trade was activated
early in the session, which contained a hefty chunk of buy orders.
   Shares trimmed their advance by midday in what one dealer called
``orderly profit-taking.''
   By about noon the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index

<TEXT>
   Aging, and expanding, baby boomers are turning
more often to low-calorie drinks and Coca-Cola Co. is bidding for
their taste buds by pitting its chief diet soda against rival
Pepsi-Cola's flagship sugared brand.
   The marketing move is the first time a major cola company has
aimed a diet drink directly at a leading non-diet competitor, and
has sparked an escalation of the war for dominance of the giant soft
drink market.
   Pepsi-Cola Co. today announced that it had signed a worldwide
sponsorship and advertising deal with pop star Madonna that will
include a major global ad campaign beginning next month and Pepsi
sponsorship of the singer's upcoming world tour.
   ``The diet segment is a big, growing segment, and as people get
older they tend more towards diet,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
beverage industry analyst with the investment firm PaineWebber in
San Francisco.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of industry newsletter Beverage Digest,
said the diet cola market grew 8.4 percent and sugared cola volume
rose 3.2 percent last year. He said diet drinks account for 25.2
percent of the $26 billion wholesale market.
   ``I believe that in the early 2010s, the diet market will be the
tail wagging the soft-drink dog,'' Meyers said.
   Goldman estimated it will take a generation before diet colas
outsell sugar colas.
   Coke and Pepsi recognized the trend last year, producing
commercials featuring prize fighters and football players that moved
away from past diet drink strategies targeting women.
   Coke's battle plan for Diet Coke was the first major marketing
excursion since Ira Herbert was named president of the company's
domestic operations last year.
   ``Diet Coke moving ahead of Pepsi is the next logical step in the
long-term trend,'' Herbert said in a statement announcing the
campaign.
   Coca-Cola _ whose Coca-Cola Classic is the nation's top-selling
brand _ announced its latest goal in the aftermath of a highly
visible advertising blitz during Sunday's Super Bowl telecast.
   The package included a ballyhooed three-dimensional spot for Diet
Coke and another new commercial featuring celebrities that included
actor and former Pepsi pitchman Don Johnson, a star of the
television show ``Miami Vice.''
   Pepsi contends Coke's claims ignore consumer propensity to buy by
price and not brand, and the No. 2 cola-maker had been expected to
mount its own counteroffensive.
   In addition to the Madonna signing, Pepsi won sponsorship of the
NFL player talent show that aired before the Super Bowl.
   The company in recent years has boosted its brands through
celebrity ads featuring Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Tina Turner
and Lionel Richie.
   Atlanta-based Coke gave no timetable for its goal of boosting
Diet Coke past Pepsi.
   ``We're not saying this is going to happen overnight or within
the next year or two. Granted, it's going to take some time,'' said
Coke USA spokesman Ron Coleman.
   Coke also claims that almost 2 million families stopped buying
regular Pepsi last year, and Coleman said more than a quarter of
them turned to Diet Coke.
   But Pepsi's McKenzie countered that half of all soft drink
consumers identify themselves as ``brand-switchers,'' meaning just
as many people switched from Coke as from Pepsi.
   Goldman backed up McKenzie, saying, ``People don't just drink one
soft drink; people do mess around.''
   Besides the new television commercials, Coke said its campaign
will include 200 million national magazine and newspaper coupons and
local sweepstakes offering airline tickets and other prizes.
   Whether Coke's plan succeeds is almost irrelevant, Meyers said.
   ``I believe that Coke believes that statistical reality is not as
important as the perception of pitting the number three brand
against the number two brand, because it finesses the number one
position for Coke Classic,'' he said.
   According to Meyers, Coca-Cola Classic topped all brands last
year with 20.1 percent of domestic sales. Pepsi was second with 18.7
percent, followed by Diet Coke at 8.2 percent and Diet Pepsi at 5.2
percent.
   Diet Coke was the fastest growing brand, gaining 0.5 percent of a
share compared with a year ago. Caffeine-free Diet Coke added 0.3
percent to reach 2 percent overall, good for ninth place.
   Together, Diet Coke and caffeine-free Diet Coke accounted for
10.2 percent of the market, Meyers said. Pepsi and caffeine-free
Pepsi had 19.5 percent, while Diet Pepsi and caffeine-free Diet
Pepsi were at 6.6 percent, he said.

   President Bush's nominee for transportation
secretary told Congress today that the United States ``can and will
take a leading role in combating terrorism in the skies.''
   Samuel K. Skinner, testifying at his confirmation hearing before
the Senate Commerce Committee, said stopping terrorism ``means
meeting head-on the gruesome threat ... with all the resources we
can muster.''
   In written responses to questions posed by the panel, Skinner
said that foreign airlines serving the United States should be
forced to meet the same security requirements as U.S. carriers.
   He said that if the government issues new security requirements
for American carriers, ``a means must be employed to assure that
foreign air carriers that offer service to the United States should
be required to make the same improvements.''
   The 50-year-old Illinois transportation administrator was also
likely to face questions about air safety, the aging U.S. aircraft
fleet and its recent rash of mechanical problems. Other likely
topics were proposals to remove the FAA from the Transportation
Department in an effort to improve its efficiency, drug testing for
transportation workers, and truck and bus safety.
   Skinner was also expected to be asked to contrast Bush's views on
federal transportation spending with those of former President
Reagan, who often sought to phase out U.S. assistance in such areas
as mass transit and Amtrak, the passenger railroad.
   As the hearing began, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, withdrew
objections to Skinner's appointment that he had expressed over
Skinner's conduct when, as U.S. attorney in Chicago, he declined to
prosecute G.D. Searle Co. There had been allegations that it
fraudulently tested NutraSweet, the artificial sweetener. Skinner
later joined the law firm that represented Searle in the case.
   Last month, Metzenbaum called for a delay in Skinner's
confirmation vote until questions about the situation were answered.
Skinner said he ``conducted himself in accordance with Department of
Justice guidelines'' in the case.
   Skinner told the senators that before leaving the U.S. attorney's
office he had ended his involvement in the Searle case and that the
decision to not prosecute the firm was made by others. Metzenbaum
said that based on Skinner's explanation he believes the appointee
to be ``a man of integrity,'' and said he now expected to vote to
confirm Skinner.
   In his written responses, Skinner said that making the security
requirements uniform would prevent U.S. airlines from losing
business because of cumbersome security procedures which might
inconvenience passengers.
   Last year, before the Dec. 21 explosion that destroyed Pan
American Flight 103 over Scotland, the Federal Aviation
Administration proposed rules that would require foreign airlines
serving the United States to have security procedures approved by
the FAA. The rule has not yet taken effect, however.
   Domestic carriers are already required to have FAA-approved
security programs.
   Eight days after the Pan Am disaster, which killed all 259 people
on board and 11 others on the ground, the FAA toughened the security
steps it requires U.S. airlines to follow at airports in Europe and
the Middle East.
   Despite Metzenbaum's objections, the sentiment on Capitol Hill
was that Skinner would have little trouble gaining Senate approval
for his new job.
   Skinner was Bush's campaign chairman in Illinois in 1980 and
1988, when Bush carried the state. He has been chairman of the
Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the
country's second largest transportation system, since 1984.
   He is also an instrument-rated pilot and a member of the Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association, which lobbies Congress on behalf of
private plane owners and pilots.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Lower in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Futures prices of grains and soybeans were lower
today in early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were weighed down by the rainy weather forecast for
the Great Plains growing areas and a slackening of U.S. wheat
exports, said Dale Gustafson, a grains analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Soybean prices pulled back because European markets didn't follow
through with Tuesday's rally in Chicago and it appears the recent
surge of commercial buying has ended, said Gustafson.
   Corn futures were lower in sympathy with the decline in wheat and
soybeans, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents to 8} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.34{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 2\ cents lower, with March at $2.70} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents
to 3 cents lower, with March at $2.32\ a bushel; and soybeans were \
cent to 4 cents lower with March at $7.65 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures rose in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .15 cent to .28 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in February at 72.92 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent higher with January at 83.60
cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .40 cent higher with
February at 43.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .72
cent to .97 cent higher with February at 40.12 cents a pound.
   On Tuesday, livestock and meat prices finished mixed to mostly
lower.

<HEAD>Report: SEC Dropped 1983 Probe Into Drexel, Milken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government investigator in 1983 concluded that
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s Michael Milken and others were
involved in securities fraud, but the case was dropped about four
years before similar charges were brought against the investment
firm, according to a report published Wednesday.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer spent two years
investigating Drexel and told superiors he had evidence of a
fraudulent scheme to disguise ownership of stocks and manipulate
stock prices, the Wall Street Journal reported.
   In a 33-page confidential memo, SEC attorney John Hewitt charged
that Milken, Drexel's high-yield ``junk bond'' financier, had
manipulated the price of shares of Reliance Group Inc., an insurance
holding company run by takeover strategist Saul Steinberg, the
newspaper said.
   The Journal did not disclose where the October 1983 memo was
obtained. But the SEC's chief enforcement officer Gary Lynch said
the newspaper received the material from an unidentified
congressional committee.
   The newspaper also reported that between 1980 and 1985 four SEC
investigations implicated Drexel and Milken but all were closed
without action.
   The SEC investigation was said to focus on trading in the stock
of Reliance and Leasco Corp., another Steinberg company, before and
after a July 1981 announcement that the companies would be merged
and taken private in 1982.
   The Journal said Hewitt wrote that ``securities were warehoused
and manipulated in a complex scheme to facilitate'' the transaction.
Warehousing involves placing stocks in accounts that disguise
ownership.
   But the probe was dropped in March 1984 because of lack of
evidence, the Journal said.
   The SEC last September filed civil charges against Drexel and
Milken accusing them of scheming with now-imprisoned inside trader
Ivan Boesky to commit securities fraud.
   On Tuesday, the government made public the six specific fraud
counts that Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to as part of a record
$650 million settlement that concluded a two-year inquiry by the
U.S. attorney's office.
   The government accused Drexel with participating in a litany of
criminal acts ranging from insider trading to stock manipulation
involving some of the biggest U.S. takeover targets of the 1980s.
   In the 1983 Hewitt memo, the Journal account said, the SEC
investigator said that from 1979 through at least 1983 Milken ran
``a trading scheme ... to warehouse and manipulate securities for
the benefit of certain (high-yield department) clients.''
   Hewitt also said two investment partnerships including Milken and
his brother, Lowell, also appeared to have violated federal
disclosure laws, the Journal account said.
   A spokesman for Milken denied any wrongdoing in the 1983
allegations. Drexel said in a statement that ``these were thorough
investigations, and to assume otherwise isn't well-founded.''
   ``But the point is that having already reached an agreement with
the U.S. attorney, we now are in good-faith negotiations with the
SEC to establish enhanced procedures that will prevent even the
appearance of these kinds of issues in the future,'' it said.
   The Journal said the investigation of Milken and Drexel began
when Reliance was cited as one of eight stocks the SEC examined
after spotting unusual price increases on New Year's Eve 1981.
   Lynch told the newspaper: ``I think you ought to put high up in
your story that you were provided with non-public documents by a
committee of Congress. Because that's how Washington works. ... I
think it stinks.''
   He did not identify the committee. But Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which
monitors the SEC, was quoted by the newspaper as saying of the 1983
probe: ``The SEC didn't use the tools Congress gave it to protect
investors, in this instance.''

   A federal inspection of safety at a nuclear
weapons plant near Denver found serious lapses caused in part by
inadequate worker training, but significant improvements are under
way, Energy Department officials said.
   The outlines of a report on the inspection, conducted by a team
of 20 safety experts last November and December, were presented
Tuesday to members of a committee advising the government on how to
correct technical and managerial problems at its nuclear weapons
complex, which has been crippled in recent months.
   The full report was not disclosed.
   A key finding by the inspectors was insufficient training of
workers at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing facility. This was
in part due to a practice by the plant operator, Rockwell
International Corp., of letting workers switch to job assignments
outside their area of expertise, officials said.
   Oliver Lynch, a department safety official, cited an instance of
workers in a low-level waste evaporator building reading the
newspaper instead of monitoring safety indicators.
   ``This struck home the need for a greater (Department of Energy)
presence in the facility,'' said Richard W. Starostecki, deputy
assistant secretary of energy for safety, health and quality
assurance.
   He and other department officials stressed, however, that
Rockwell managers had shown a much greater willingness to improve
safety procedures at the plant, which reprocesses plutonium from old
nuclear weapons for use in new ones. He said this change in
Rockwell's attitude had emerged over the past year.
   Rockwell has made a ``noteworthy first step'' toward meeting
Energy Department concerns, he said, by developing a comprehensive
long-term strategy for safety improvements.
   The plant, situated about 16 miles from Denver, was shut down by
federal authorities last October after an incident in which three
employees were accidentally exposed to plutonium particles.
   Starostecki also reaffirmed to the advisory panel that a phased
and closely monitored restarting of the Rocky Flats plant had begun
last week. He said the plant could be in full operation as early as
late March.
   At the same briefing to the advisory panel, Starostecki said more
study will be needed to determine the severity of numerous cracks in
the cooling systems of a South Carolina reactor complex that
produces key ingredients for nuclear weapons.
   The Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., is the nation's only
source of tritium, a perishable and increasingly scarce gas vital to
making nuclear warheads.
   The three-reactor complex has not been producing tritium since
last April, when the Energy Department shut down the last active
reactor for safety reasons.
   Starostecki said an accident Sunday during testing at the
Savannah River Plant indicates ``a lack of control over what's going
on in the reactors.''
   Federal officials said there was no leakage of radiation or other
hazardous material from the incident. The operator, E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co., estimated damage at $20,000.
   Du Pont disclosed earlier this month that it had discovered and
was monitoring 27 cooling system cracks, including 15 in the K
reactor, which it hopes to restart by the end of this year.
   John Ahearne, chairman of the Energy Department's advisory
committee on nuclear facility safety, said Starostecki told his
panel the cracking problem was ``probably not as serious as has been
suggested, but it's still an open question.''
   If the cracked pipes need to be replaced, the work could cause
further delays in restarting the reactors.

   A bipartisan group of 12 senators unveiled
legislation today that would reject a proposed 50 percent
congressional pay raise, and roll back the increase if the House
lets it become law.
   The rollback proposal is designed to give Senate pay-raise
opponents a better weapon than a simple resolution to turn down the
increase. It could keep the issue alive even if the raise goes into
effect.
   Senators are expected to overwhelmingly reject the pay raise,
while at the same time knowing that a House vote appears unlikely.
Unless both chambers reject the pay plan recommended by former
President Reagan, the raise would become law automatically on Feb. 8.
   Reagan, following the advice of a commission, recommended that
congressional salaries rise from $89,500 to $135,000 for
rank-and-file lawmakers.
   The recommendation would allow the House speaker to receive
$175,000 instead of $115,000; and would pay $155,000 to the
president pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority
leaders of each house _ all of whom now earn $99,500.
   Reagan also recommended 50 percent increases for top political
appointees in the executive branch and for judges.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., a main sponsor of the new
legislation, said the rollback was the key provision. If the Senate
approves the legislation and sends it to the House, House opponents
of the raise could keep trying to tack it on to other bills after
Feb. 8.
   The legislation also would require a vote on all future pay
raises.
   Senate sponsors accused the House leadership of trying to duck a
vote. Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has been non-committal, while
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised a
Senate vote.
   ``It's ridiculous not to have a vote on the pay raise,'' Sen.
Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters. ``Not only is the
amount outlandish, but it sets a pretty bad example. The public
hates the pay increase and the way it's approved.''
   Any rollback also would affect 50 percent raises for top
executive branch officials, which also were part of Reagan's
recommendation. Raises for judges were in Reagan's package also, but
cannot constitutionally be cut back once they take effect.
   The Senate sponsors of the legislation are Sens. Pressler;
Grassley; Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; David Boren, D-Okla.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.;
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. and Howell Heflin, R-Ala.
   On Tuesday, 35 House members wrote Wright to demand a vote ``out
of respect for the American taxpayer.''
   The letter, written by Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., was signed
by 30 Republicans and five Democrats. Wright had no comment.
   ``The prospect of an increase in congressional salaries has
prompted a broad range of comments, but there is one theme that is
constant,'' the letter said. ``The American people are firm in their
conviction that regardless of the legislative form, there must be a
vote on this enormous pay raise.''
   The letter said that ``avoiding this issue is not the answer.''
   Signing the letter were Democrats Mike Synar, Okla.; G.V.
``Sonny'' Montgomery, Miss.; W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, La.; Timothy J.
Penny, Minn.; and Peter A. DeFazio, Ore.
   Republicans: Thomas J. Tauke, Iowa; Robert F. Smith, Ore.; Cass
Ballenger, N.C.; Howard C. Nielson, Utah; Jim Courter, N.J.; Robert
C. Smith, N.H.; Jim Bunning, Ky.; Bob Stump, Ariz.; Peter Smith,
Vt.; Olympia J. Snow, Maine; Bill Emerson, Mo.; John J. Rhodes III,
Ariz.; James M. Inhofe, Okla.;
   Helen Delich Bentley, Md.; Dan Schaefer, Colo.; Clyde C.
Holloway, La.; Norman D. Shumway, Calif.; Jim Leach, Iowa; Larry E.
Craig, Idaho; Patricia F. Saiki, Hawaii; Virginia Smith, Neb.; Lamar
S. Smith, Texas; Craig T. James, Fla.; Michael Bilirakis, Fla.;

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
Tuesday's runup to the highest levels since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.04 points on
Tuesday, gained another 3.93 to 2,260.36 by noontime today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 708 up, 572 down and
530 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market lately has appeared to be emerging from
the long shadow cast by the crash.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest
level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a
big step in that direction.
   The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign
exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market.
   With all that, however, brokers said there remained many
skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase
after stocks at their current levels.
   Raychem climbed 1 to 33 and Smithkline Beckman rose 1{ to 52[ in
active trading. Both companies reported better-than-expected
quarterly earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .08 to 162.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .45 at 319.19.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93.95 million shares at noontime,
up from 82.10 million at the same point Tuesday.

   President Bush said today his administration is
considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan
institutions to help the federal government pay to insure the
troubled S&amp;L industry.
   A Treasury Department spokesman said accounts in commercial banks
and credit unions also would be subject to the fees.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, appearing on television
interview programs, said plans under review include such fees as 25
cents for every $100 in deposits at a thrift and that the premiums
would be used by the federal government to insure the deposits.
   At the White House, Bush said, ``That's one option,'' adding that
the idea had not been presented as a formal recommendation. ``And so
I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but that is one option,''
he said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters,
``What you're looking at today is a trial balloon'' that was leaked
to see what the reaction would be. ``There will be other trial
balloons.''
   ``We think it has merit,'' Fitzwater said. ``Let's see how people
react.'' He said the idea was first proposed as part of former
President Reagan's budget but didn't draw much attention.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu spoke warmly about the
proposal but insisted that it was ``one of many alternatives still
being studied.'' He insisted it would be a ``premium'' and not a tax
that would violated Bush's no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``That's just like any other insurance premium _ revenue
generation for services rendered,'' Brady said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' ``The important thing here is that the federal
insurance on deposits is going to be continued.''
   Brady said administration officials have taken the plan to the
chairmen of the congressional banking committees, Sen. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., and Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   ``They know how big this program is,'' he said. ``They're giving
us plenty of of time to look at the options. They've been
receptive.''
   Arthur Siddon, a spokesman for Brady, said the Treasury
Department has not clearly defined the option. He said the fee
mentioned by Brady could be imposed on depositors, or it could be
paid by the institutions as an increase in the insurance premium
they already pay.
   The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insured
financial institutions: banks, S&amp;Ls and credit unions, he said.
Previously, Siddon said the fee might apply only to S&amp;Ls.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures deposits in commercial banks, told The
Washington Post that the proposal was ``the reverse toaster theory.
Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit,
you give them one.''
   Brady emphasized the plan has not been adopted by the
administration _ he said it hasn't even been presented to President
Bush _ and rejected suggestions that it would represent a tax
increase for S&amp;L customers.
   ``What we're doing is to examine all manner of options to pay for
this savings and loan problem we have. It's a big problem. So we're
discussing all kinds of things _ insurance based premiums, various
different kind of options like that,'' he said on NBC's ``Today''
program.
   The Post, quoting unnamed sources, said the fee could raise $9
billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $20
billion to $30 billion the government will have to raise for several
years to close S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors.
   Another proposal, under which taxpayers would foot the bill for
closing insolvent institutions, is being offered by the savings and
loan industry's largest trade group. The proposal, released Tuesday
by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, would also cut the fee
that thrifts pay for deposit insurance.
   The proposal would give the Treasury responsibility for paying to
resolve the cases of more than 350 insolvent, but still open, S&amp;Ls.
   Bush, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said he
would propose substantial revisions next month to Ronald Reagan's
budget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis.
   The League proposal called for tougher regulation, but said S&amp;Ls
should be preserved as an industry separate from commercial banking.
The recommendation, which the group plans to present at a
congressional hearing Thursday, drew immediate criticism from
members of the House Banking Committee.
   ``It's called, `How to transfer the problems of the S&amp;L industry
to the taxpayers,''' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a member of the
House Banking Committee.
   Parris said the healthy portion of the S&amp;L industry shouldn't be
bled dry, but he said the lobby group ``is just trying to put a
sugar coating on a pretty bitter pill.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said, ``The League proposal represents a
realistic recognition that tougher regulation is in order, but an
unrealistic expectation that the taxpayers should be stuck with the
bill.''
   ``The more money the taxpayers are asked to eat, the tougher the
reform package should be,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The U.S. League plan calls for the creation of a Resolution
Corporation, a new, independent federal agency that would be
responsible for liquidating or selling currently insolvent S&amp;Ls as
well as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next
three years.
   It also would take over all of the obligations the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has acquired in rescuing
institutions in the past.
   The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes,
which would be guaranteed by the Treasury. Any money the corporation
gets from selling failed S&amp;Ls to new investors or from selling the
assets would go toward paying off the notes. However, the Treasury
would have to pay most of the bill.
   In the meantime, a new, industry-funded FSLIC would be created to
insure the deposits of healthy S&amp;Ls, which would pay an insurance
premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to
their fund, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
looking at the possibility of making managers of companies involved
in leveraged buyouts or takeover attempts disclose more information
about their own fate in the transactions, SEC Chairman David Ruder
said today.
   Ruder told the Senate Finance Committee that managers involved in
some recent takeovers have avoided SEC regulations requiring them to
disclose their own interest in the surviving company in third-party
takeovers because they are not a direct participant.
   ``They may have an implied promise by the takeover or financial
people that technically falls outside the transaction,'' Ruder said.
``Technically our rules now don't require them to disclose that.''
   He said those assurances to managers usually take the form of
``We will not promise you equity participation (in the new company)
but in our 45 previous transactions we always have.''
   Ruder said the commission is now looking at revising its
regulations on management disclosures to require them in all
negotiated transactions. But he said that no new legislation is
needed to do it.
   ``We have sufficiently broad rulemaking powers,'' he said.
   Ruder was the second witness in two days of hearings by the
Finance Committee into the mushrooming of junk-bond-financed
leveraged buyout attempts, some of them launched by managers of
exisiting companies, in the past year.
   After RJR Nabisco's managers tried to buy up all the publicly
owned stock last November in a leveraged buyout only to be outbid
with a 30 percent higher $25 billion offer from Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., there have been concerns about whether managements in
such takeovers are acting in the best interests of stock and bond
holders.
   Ruder said that as long as there is an auction process,
shareholders ususally end up maximizing their gain. But he expressed
concern they may not be getting the maximum value in deals where a
company's publicly held stock is purchased in buybacks without an
effective bidding process.
   Testifying Tuesday before the same committee, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady estimated the cost of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs,
and takeover defenses at $60 billion in 1988 alone.
   While many restructured companies find themselves in trouble
because they cannot make the interest payments on their new debt,
the investment banks, arbitrageurs, underwriters and LBO managers
involved in the deals collect hundreds of millions of dollars in
up-front fees, he complained.
   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,
investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' he
said. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the net
effect of LBOs is a financial snipe hunt, where the new long-term
investors, flashlight in hand, are left holding the bag.''
   Brady's testimony on the wave of leveraged buyouts was the
strongest indication yet that the new administration wants the trend
reversed.
   The Treasury secretary said he would prefer that ``the gladiators
in the arena'' _ the investment bankers, corporate and insurance
executives and pension fund managers who trade in high-interest,
high-risk junk bonds _ address the problem on their own. But he
coupled that with a warning.
   ``It is the finest tradition of our democratic system that
government look first to the people themselves for solutions and
only act _ but do act _ when it is clear the people cannot solve the
problem themselves,'' he said.
   However, how far the government should go in restraining buyouts
is wide open to debate.
   The most widely discussed option is not allowing companies to
deduct as an expense the high rates of interest they pay on junk
bonds _ a move that both Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan attempted to discourage Tuesday while acknowledging it may
happen anyway.
   Greenspan told the House Banking Committee on Tuesday that
attempting to tax the interest on junk bonds would probably be
ineffective because corporate lawyers would find some other way of
tax-free debt financing.
   Brady agreed. ``The long history of attempts to define problems
out of existence has proved that the definees are more adept then
the definers,'' he said. ``Just as soon as the new regulations are
written, efforts are under way to render them irrelevant.''
   Like Greenspan, Brady said he would prefer that Congress reduce
the tax on dividends to encourage more equity financing of
corporations. But both men acknowledged that is unlikely because of
the budget deficit.
   When the Reagan administration in 1985 proposed giving companies
a tax credit for the dividends they pay, the annual cost to the
Treasury in lost tax dollars was put at $7 billion.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Prepares For Visits With Possible Buyers</HEAD>

   Texas Eastern Corp. officials said today they have
begun scheduling appointments with possible buyers and denied that
their claims of more than 50 suitors are meant to stall a Coastal
Corp. takeover attempt by boosting stock prices.
   ``The process is well under way,'' said Texas Eastern spokesman
Fred Wichlep. ``We have set up data rooms here in our building and
have already started making appointments with representatives of
other companies to come in and review our data and to hear
presentations by officers of the company.''
   Trading in Texas Eastern stock was suspended briefly Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange after a company lawyer told U.S.
District Judge Lynn N. Hughes that the natural-gas company might use
a ``white knight'' to block Coastal's $2.6 billion takeover bid.
   Texas Eastern attorney Ewing Werlein told Hughes that the company
has a list of more than 50 possible buyers.
   Officials of Coastal, another Houston-based natural-gas company,
later suggested that the comment was designed to inflate Texas
Eastern stock prices to make Coastal's offer appear inadequate.
   Texas Eastern officials said the number is legitimate and was
provided only to inform Hughes of their actions, but they
acknowledged they are trying to maximize their stock price.
   ``This is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine
the maximum value of Texas Eastern stock,'' Wichlep said this
morning.
   Texas Eastern stock closed at $48.25 Tuesday, down from its
record $48.50 close Monday. Trading was suspended at 11:20 a.m.
because of an imbalance of shares on the buy side, but resumed at
12:09 p.m.
   Coastal has offered $42 per share for all outstanding Texas
Eastern shares. The company already owns 4 percent to 5 percent of
Texas Eastern's stock.
   During the three-hour hearing, Hughes denied a Texas Eastern
request to delay a Feb. 7 hearing in a Coastal lawsuit designed to
prevent Texas Eastern from using its poison pill plan and other
anti-takeover measures.
   ``It was a major victory,'' James R. Paul, Coastal's president
and chief operating officer, said today in a statement. ``Texas
Eastern's effort at delay is nothing more than a stall designed to
deny their stockholders the right to ultimately determine the
disposition of their stock.''
   Paul said his company has asked Texas Eastern for information
that would justify a higher bid, but said the only response has been
``rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last Sunday.''
   The meeting between executives of the two companies was the only
face-to-face contact since Coastal announced its takeover bid Jan.

   President Bush said today that while he's
determined to be an environmentalist, he favors ``prudent
development'' by oil companies in the Arctic wildlife refuge.
   Commenting on an issue environmentalists say will be a litmus
test of his intentions, Bush said he believes ``we can find the
balance between environmental interests and national security
interests'' to permit some development of oil and gas resources in
the refuge.
   Environmentalists have been trying to enlist Bush's support to
keep oil companies out of the vast refuge.
   For years there has been a fierce debate in Congress and between
environmentalists and the oil companies over whether a
1.5-million-acre coastal strip of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in northeastern Alaska should be opened for oil drilling.
   In the final days of the Reagan administration, Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel formally urged Congress to clear the way for
oil and gas development in the refuge and proposed a land swap deal
as the best way to do it.
   A dozen of the leading environmental and conservation groups,
including some of the movement's biggest names, urged Bush in a
letter Tuesday to review Interior's position with an eye toward
reversing the department's recommendation to Congress.
   ``We have strenuously opposed this proposal as a shortsighted
sacrifice of a national treasure for a few months of energy that is
readily procurable elsewhere,'' the groups said.
   But in an Oval Office interview with a small group of reporters
today, Bush said that brought to mind similar arguments made about
the Alaska oil pipeline.
   ``I remember the pipeline. I remember the arguments against it,''
he said. ``And I also know the effect it did not have on the
caribou.''
   Bush has said his administration intends to be a strong defender
of the environment, but also has indicated in the past that he
favors expanded oil drilling in the Arctic.
   ``I'm in favor of prudent development there,'' he said today. ``
... I think I'm determined to be an environmentalist. I am one, and
I'm concerned that we not do irreparable damage to the environment.''
   But Bush also said that ``we have some national security
interests at stake here'' in terms of making the country less
reliant on imported energy supplies.
   Congress must approve opening up any of the 19-million-acre
wildlife refuge in northeastern Alaska for drilling, and it didn't
take long for the issue to surface this year.
   On the first day of the 101st Congress, legislation was
introduced with 38 co-sponsors in the House to declare the
1.5-million-acre coastal strip of the Arctic wildlife refuge a
protected wilderness. On the same day, other legislation also was
introduced in the House to open the same land for oil and gas
development.
   The oil industry ``would like to move this fast'' and ``create a
sense of national emergency'' before environmental groups can
mobilize, suggested George Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness
Society.
   Hodel's action last week at the end of his tenure as interior
secretary infuriated the environmental movement, which has vowed to
fight any attack on the refuge _ home for the Porcupine caribou,
polar bears and millions of birds.
   Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, called on
Bush to intervene in ``the rush to trample the Arctic'' and said the
president's actions on Arctic development will be ``the test of this
administration'' on whether it is serious about protecting the
environment.
   Earlier in the week, many of the environmental leaders met with
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, to voice their
concern about the wildlife refuge.
   Frampton questioned the need to open the Arctic region now for
drilling when there is no need for the additional petroleum. In
future years, he suggested, technology might be developed to protect
the environment better.
   ``We can postpone the decision and have it both ways _ wilderness
and oil,'' he said.
   Other groups that signed the letter to Bush were the National
Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League of America, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, National Audubon Society, National Parks
and Conservation Association, Friends of the Earth, Environmental
Policy Institute, Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Policy
Institute.

   There is an hour wait on weekends for a table at
the 140-seat restaurant of the Great Lakes Brewing Co. as patrons
jam the bar to guzzle European-style beer brewed on the premises.
   ``We're brewing around the clock and selling it as fast as we
make it,'' said Daniel Conway, 27, who owns the bar with his brother
Patrick.
   The brothers restored Cleveland's first tavern last September and
started brewing beer, part of a growing nationwide brewing trend as
local brewers apply their craft in ``brewpubs'' and
``microbreweries,'' offering a variety of beers to local clientele.
   Great Lakes patrons can choose from three different brews at
$2.20 a glass with names such as Eliot's Amber, named for Eliot
Ness, who frequented the bar and ran for mayor of Cleveland before
gaining fame as a lawman, said Daniel Conway.
   Brewer Thaine Johnson, who worked for Cleveland's former
Christian Schmidt Brewing Co., was persuaded to come out of
retirement and apply his skills on a smaller scale.
   Great Lakes can brew 750 to 1,000 31-gallon barrels of beer a
year, a typical amount for brewpubs which offer beer for on-premise
consumption.
   Microbreweries brew and bottle beer for regional consumption,
though the City of Angels Brewing Co., Santa Monica, Calif., which
operates a 250-seat restaurant in a revamped furniture store, hopes
to offer their ale both ways.
   ``We are hoping to offer people small plastic, resealable kegs so
people can take it home,'' said bar manager Jim Lucitt, adding the
brewpub has attracted a number of celebrities since it opened a year
ago.
   ``Michael Keaton stops in every now and then. Wilt Chamberlain
was in the other night and Magic (Johnson) stops by,'' Lucitt said.
   At the start of 1986, there were only 29 microbreweries,
breweries which produce less than 15,000 barrels a year, and
brewpubs in North America, according to the Association of Brewers,
Boulder, Colo.
   Since then, the number has doubled each year. At the start of
1989, there were 120 brewpubs and microbreweries operating in North
America, said Charlie Papazian, who founded the association in 1978
and edits the association's magazine titled Zymurgy, the branch of
chemistry dealing with fermentation.
   At the Rooster Court Bar and Grill in Northampton, Mass., patrons
can try a brown ale named Old Brown Dog or, in the summer, a light,
wheat beer, said Peter Egelston, a co-owner of the brewpub.
   ``The novelty of the beer is enough to bring people in the first
time, but not enough to bring them back,'' Egelston said.
   In Hartford, Conn., The Chester Fife &amp; Drum Corps will help usher
in Connecticut's new brew Feb. 1 when John Foley, president of the
Connecticut Brewing Co., rolls out the first barrel of Nathan Hale
Lager.
   Foley, 26, developed his interest in beer at the University of
Notre Dame where he reviewed the history of brewing for a seminar.
   After graduation, he worked in New York in invesment banking but
continued to study the market for beer and, after raising $500,000,
founded the brewing company, basing his beer on a recipe that dates
to colonial America.
   ``It's a renaissance back to pre-prohibition days when Manhattan
had over 100 breweries,'' Foley said. ``There were 4,000 breweries
in the United States in 1870 but by 1980, there were only 40 in the
country.''
   But the brewing giants of the country need not fear competition
from the new upstarts.
   The Boulder brewers' association reports microbreweries and
brewpubs brewed a total of 100,000 barrels of beer in 1987, or about
one-half percent of all beer brewed and sold in North America. That
figure increased to 120,000 in 1988 and Papazian said the
microbreweries and brewpubs may hit the 180,000-barrel mark in 1989.
   The large breweries continue to dominate the domestic beer
industry which in 1988 brewed and sold 188 million barrels of beer
in the United States, about the same amount as the year before, said
Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, which tracks
trends in the brewing industry from West Nyack, N.Y.
   ``You are obviously not talking about a major impact on the
industry,'' said Steinman. ``In the Northwest, some microbreweries
may have an impact on some imports and superpremiums but they are
not hurting the beer industry.''
   Beer from microbreweries and brewpubs, generally more expensive
than domestic beer, attracts the same consumers as import beers and
could have an impact on overall sales of foreign-brewed beer which
accounts for about 5 percent of beer sold in the United States,
Steinman said.

   President Bush said today he believes the
economy is ``reasonably stable'' and hopes the Federal Reserve Board
won't overreact to inflationary fears by driving interest rates up
further.
   Bush said in an Oval Office interview with two newspaper
reporters that he had not yet read comments that Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made Tuesday to a House committee.
Greenspan voiced concern about inflation and said the board would
keep a tight grip on the money supply.
   Asked about this today, Bush said, ``I must say that I'm
encouraged that the markets, at least recently, have been saying
that things are reasonably stable. ... There's no signals out there
in the markets that this economy is in real trouble.''
   The president said, ``I haven't talked to Alan lately, but I
don't want to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation
that we impede growth. We have to keep expanding opportunities for
the working men and women of this country.''
   Bush said, however, that he preferred not ``to get into
commenting on'' Greenspan's testimony.
   Greenspan told the House Banking Committee he was worried that
strains on factory capacity and a tight labor market, particularly
in the Northeast, are likely to keep inflation pressures bubbling in
the near term.
   As a result, the central bank's monetary policy should continue
on the tight side, he said.
   ``The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation, and the
risks of this occurring under current circumstances, are
sufficiently great that Federal Reserve policy at this juncture
might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness
than of stimulus,'' he said.
   But, in response to questions, Greenspan also indicated that the
central bank would like to lower interest rates if it can be done at
some point without causing an acceleration in price increases.
   ``Obviously we would prefer interest rates to be lower rather
than higher all the time,'' he said.
   The stock market surged higher Tuesday, pushing the Dow Jones
industrial average for the first time back to the levels it held
just before the October 1987 market crash. Market watchers said
investor optimism about Greenspan's comments helped fuel the rally.
   ``The market reaction read it, No. 1, in the short term the Fed
will continue to tighten to ensure that inflation is under control,
but more importantly, in the longer run Greenspan leaned more in the
direction of lower interest rates,'' said John Wilson, chief
economist of the Bank of America.
   However, Greenspan's accompanying contention that economic growth
must dip below 3 percent could spell serious trouble for the
administration of President Bush, who is counting on high growth and
lower interest rates to bring the budget deficit down.
   The growth generates more tax revenue for the government, while
lower interest rates reduce the carrying costs on the $2.7 trillion
national debt.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Up 6.5 Percent At U S West, 6.2 Percent At Bell
Atlantic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the regional Bell holding companies on Wednesday reported
higher profits in the fourth quarter, a 6.5 percent gain at U S West
Inc. and a 6.2 percent rise at Bell Atlantic Corp.
   Denver-based U S West, which provides local phone service in
western and northwestern states, said its earnings rose to $271.7
million, or $1.49 a share, from $255 million, or $1.35 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 1.1 percent to $2.35 billion from $2.32
billion.
   For the full year, U S West said its earnings rose 12.6 percent
to $1.13 billion, or $6.17 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $5.31 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.22 billion from
$8.7 billion.
   The 1988 results included a one-time gain of $89 million from the
second-quarter sale of shares by the company's cellular and paging
subsidiary, U S West NewVector Group Inc.
   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which serves mid-Atlantic
states, said its earnings rose in the quarter to $302.6 million, or
$1.53 a share, from $285 million, or $1.44 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 1.8 percent to $2.77 billion from $2.72 billion.
   For the full year, profit rose to $1.32 billion, or $6.65 a
share, from $1.24 billion, or $6.24 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $10.9 billion from $10.7 billion.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Reports 28.5 Percent Drop In 4th-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said Wednesday its earnings rose 26.9
percent in 1988 but fell 28.5 percent in the fourth quarter because
of a $348 million pre-tax charge to cover a restructuring at General
Foods.
   Philip Morris, the New York-based cigarette, food and brewing
giant that completed the purchase of Kraft Inc. last month, said it
earned $342 million, or $1.48 a share, in the quarter, down from
$478 million, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 19.9
percent to $8.64 billion from $7.2 billion.
   For the full year, Philip Morris said its earnings rose to $2.34
billion, or $10.03 a share, from $1.84 billion, or $7.75 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 12.6 percent to $31.7 billion from $28.2
billion.
   The charge at General Foods USA and General Foods Worldwide
Coffee &amp; International covered the closing of a Jell-O plant in
Lafayette, Ind., and other streamlining moves, including layoffs.
Excluding that charge, fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 15.9
percent.
   Philip Morris said its acquisition of Kraft on Dec. 7, 1988,
reduced its earnings by about $28 million, including financing costs
and amortization of goodwill. But adoption of a new method of
accounting for income taxes boosted net earnings for 1988 by $213
million.
   Kraft contributed $821 million in operating revenue to Philip
Morris since its early-December acquisition. However, the Kraft
purchase also boosted Philip Morris's debt by $10.6 billion,
including $1 billion that was on Kraft's books.
   ``As was the case when we acquired General Foods three years ago,
we are assuming large additional debt,'' Hamish Maxwell, the
chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
   ``We are confident of our ability to service this
acquisition-related debt and to pay it down over the next few years,
as well as to sustain a good growth in earnings, volume and market
shares in 1989 and beyond,'' Maxwell said.
   Among individual market segments, Philip Morris said revenue rose
11.3 percent to $8.5 billion at Philip Morris USA; rose 15.4 percent
to $8.1 billion at Philip Morris International; rose 9.8 percent to
$3.8 billion at General Foods USA; rose ``slightly'' to $4.4 billion
at General Foods Worldwide Coffee &amp; International; rose 5 percent to
$2.3 billion at Oscar Mayer Foods; and rose 5.1 percent to $3.3
billion at Miller Brewing Co.

<HEAD>Miller Continues Slide As Anheuser-Busch Remains No. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. solidified its grip on
the nation's beer market last year while Miller Brewing Co. saw its
flagship brand slip from the ranks of the top five, according to an
industry newsletter.
   Anheuser-Busch, based in St. Louis, continued to hold the top
spot in beer shipments, with its Budweiser brand in the lead at 50.4
million barrels last year, an increase over 49.5 million in 1987,
according to Beer Marketer's Insights.
   Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light made gains on Miller's Lite beer, the
No. 2 brand in the country. Lite had shipments of 19.3 million
barrels in 1988, but Bud Light grew by 18 percent to 9.7 million
barrels to grab the No. 3 ranking.
   Coors Light, a product of the Adolph Coors Co. of Golden, Colo.,
had shipments of 8.9 million barrels, making it the No. 4 brand.
   Anheuser-Busch's Busch brand came in No. 5 at 8.65 million
barrels.
   Miller High Life, the flagship brand of the Milwaukee-based
brewer, had been ranked No. 3 in the country in 1987. But the brand
dropped to sixth in 1988 at 8.35 million barrels.
   The figures were reported this week by the newsletter, based in
West Nyack, N.Y.

<HEAD>American Express Reports Profit For Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. reported Wednesday that it
made a profit in the fourth quarter following a year-earlier loss
while earnings for all of 1988 nearly doubled.
   The company attributed the improvement to record income in the
divisions that run its credit card and financial services businesses
and to a rebound in earnings from its bank following an easing of
the Third World debt crisis.
   However, its brokerage firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc., lost money in the final quarter and suffered a decline in
annual income.
   American Express said net income totaled $231 million, or 54
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a
$104 million loss in the 1987 quarter. Revenue jumped 34 percent, to
$6.3 billion from $4.8 billion.
   The 1987 quarter included a $350 million after-tax provision for
loan losses at American Express Bank and $46 million in tax benefits
from new accounting rules.
   For the year, American Express netted $1.04 billion, or $2.43 a
share, compared with earnings of $533 million, or $1.20 a share, in
1987. Revenue totaled $22.9 billion, up 30 percent from $17.7
billion in the previous year.
   Chairman James D. Robinson III said the latest quarterly and
annual results ``demonstrated our leadership position in travel and
financial services.''
   ``Two of our four business units reported record income for the
year,'' Robinson noted in a statement. ``Travel Related Services led
the way with record earnings in 1988, capping a decade in which
profits compounded at more than 17 percent a year.''
   At the Travel Related Services division, which runs the credit
card and travelers checks business, quarterly earnings climbed 18
percent to $184 million from $155 million. For the year, it earned a
record $773 million, up 18 percent from 1987 income of $655 million.
Revenue in 1988 rose 22 percent to $7.4 billion.
   During the year, credit-card charge volume climbed 18 percent to
a record $89 billion, partly reflecting additional services offered
to cardmembers.
   Travelers checks sales also rose in 1988, to $23.5 billion from
$22 billion.
   IDS Financial Services posted a 20 percent jump in quarterly
earnings to a record $41 million from $34 million, American Express
said. For the year, the division netted $148 million, up 19 percent
from $124 million earned in 1987.
   The company said sales of securities, annuity and investment
certificates led the increase.
   American Express Bank earned $47 million in the quarter, compared
with a loss of $296 million in 1987, when it added to its loan-loss
provision to cover shaky Third World debt. For the year it earned
$149 million, compared with a previous-year loss of $625 million.
   The company said that last year it reduced its exposure to Third
World loans by about 46 percent.
   American Express had reported Tuesday that Shearson Lehman
narrowed its fourth-quarter loss to $13.5 million from $95 million
in the 1987. Its annual income totaled $96 million, or 81 cents a
share, down 5 percent from $101 million, or $1 a share, in 1987.
   The company said the unit was still faced with expenses from the
acquisition of E.F. Hutton Inc. in January 1988.

big step in that direction.
   The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign

   Norway's government-owned oil company,
Statoil, Wednesday proposed an early retirement program and a
continued hiring freeze in an effort to trim 2 billion kronor, or
$300 million, from its annual operating costs.
   The company said it also may reduce and defer investments ``and
is considering whether to sell or exchange offshore equities.''
   The proposals were prepared for a meeting of the board of
directors, a company statement said.
   ``Such cuts are in line with what we expected,'' said Oil and
Energy Minister Arne Oeien, welcoming the company's move.
   Statoil, which has been hit by the fall in North Sea oil prices,
said its three-year goal was to reduce manpower by 1,500 man-years,
or about 14 percent.
   It also would reduce the work given to outside consultants or
temporary employees. Retirement will be offered to anyone who has
turned 60 by this year.
   The layoff of personnel will depend on how successul the
cost-cutting program is, the statement said.

<HEAD>U.S. Tells Europeans It Wants Talks on Telecommunications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has asked the European
Economic Community to begin negotiations to ensure the American
telecommunications industry has broad access to European markets, a
senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
   ``We want a free and open market,'' said Alfred H. Kingon, the
U.S. ambassador to the 12-nation trading bloc, also known as the
Common Market.
   He told reporters the 1988 U.S. Trade Act targets the
telecommunications area for discussions with leading trading
partners. It requires that negotiations in that field begin within
30 days.
   ``We want market access for the United States' products and
services,'' he said.
   ``We want non-discriminatory procurement policies (and)
non-discriminatory standards-setting,'' he said. ``And we want some
reasonable access to European telecommunications networks.''
   ``What we want in Europe is what (Europeans) want in the United
States,'' he said.
   Kingon said he discussed the request for opening the fresh talks
with Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trade official, and Filippo
Pandolfi, who holds the telecommunications portfolio.
   EEC spokesman Nico Wegter said the EEC had not received details
about the U.S. complaints. ``Pending this further information, the
community is indeed seriously concerned about this matter,'' he said.
   The world market in telecommunications equipment amounted to $90
billion in 1986, according to EEC figures. The EEC had 19 percent of
the market share and the United States 38 percent.
   The EEC is to form a unified, single market by the end of 1992,
when the dozen member states plan to remove the trade barriers
separating them.
   Some in the United States worry that the community will use its
newfound closeness to try to keep out U.S. and other foreign
competition.
   Telecommunications policies, tariffs and certification vary among
the member states. The European Commission, the community's
executive body, issued a plan last June for fashioning a common
internal market for trade in telecommunications equipment and
services by 1992.
   Kingon said the United States approves of the principles in that
plan. But, he said, ``We would have liked (it) to have gone perhaps
a little further and state specifically, rather than by inherent
implication, that third-country exporters would have access to that
market.''
   He said the telecommunications area was not covered effectively
by regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
96-nation free trade body. International negotiations, under the
auspices of GATT, are under way to press for further easing of trade
barriers. Telecommunications is an area under discussion in those
talks, called the Uruguay Round.
   Kingon insisted the U.S. decision to call for talks with the EEC
was not intended to spark a trade dispute.
   ``It is not a new brawl. It is not retaliation,'' he said.
   The new trade legislation gives U.S. officials a year to complete
negotiations but the president can grant additional one-year
extensions to complete discussions.
   ``There is nothing in the law that mandates the president to take
any kind of retaliatory action,'' Kingon said.

   Share prices finished narrowly mixed Wednesday, as
players took advantage of the market's recent surge to take some
profits ahead of Friday's scheduled release of British trade figures.
   Prices soared in heavy early trading following Wall Street's
gains Tuesday, pushing the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index to its best level since the October 1987 stock crash.
   But prices began to decline on profit-taking in the afternoon, a
trend that picked up momentum as the day drew to a close.
   The 100-share index finished with a loss of 2.1 points, or 0.1
percent, at 1,939.0, just 2 points above its worst level for the
day, reached at late afternoon. The index rallied as much as 26
points in early trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended with a slight gain of
0.1 point at 1,580.8, reflecting stronger performances in some of
the major stocks.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 0.35 point to 1,092.64
at the close.
   Volume reached a hefty 924.7 million shares, up from 562.8
million shares Tuesday.

   Futures prices of grains and soybeans were mostly
lower Wednesday at the close on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``There was no significant business in Japan or Europe to cause
any buying today,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor
operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Soybean prices pulled back _ as much as 14{ cents on the spot
March contract _ because European markets didn't follow through with
Tuesday's rally in Chicago and it appears the recent spurt of
commercial buying has been completed, said Dale Gustafson, a grains
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Wheat prices were weighed down by the rainy weather forecast for
the Great Plains growing areas and a slackening of U.S. wheat
exports, said Gustafson.
   Corn futures were lower in sympathy with the decline in wheat and
soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was } cent higher to 2} cents lower, with the

   The government is investigating reports that
Mexico's stock market has been involved in laundering drug money, a
top official said Wednesday.
   Assistant Attorney General Javier Coello Trejos said the
government is looking into the movement of a reported $20 million in
drug money through banks in Mexico and the United States. He did not
name any banks.
   ``We will be implacable in finding all of those who launder money
for drug traffickers. It's dirty money. It's money made by poisoning
humanity. We are investigating daily,'' he told reporters.
   Last June, the director of the stock exchange and its operations
chief resigned in a scandal in which $7 million in investors' money
vanished through what were called administrative irregularities.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo was quoted in
Wednesday's editions of the Mexico City daily La Jornada as saying
his department would investigate whether drug money was involved in
last year's stock market scandal.

<HEAD>Weirton Steel To Go Public In Agreement With Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEIRTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weirton Steel Corp. said Wednesday it would
go public to raise money for a $600 million modernization project
under a plan allowing workers at the nation's largest employee-owned
company to retain a majority stake.
   The country's seventh-largest steelmaker said it will apply for a
listing on the New York Stock Exchange when it goes public later
this year, pending approval of the plan by employees.
   The agreement between the company's management and the
Independent Steelworkers Union would reduce the 8,000 employees'
profit sharing from 50 percent to 35 percent of the company's
after-tax income. The company's pension plan would not change.
   The agreement also calls for a public stock offering of at least
$50 million worth of the 6.5 million common shares now held by
employees.
   In addition, it would create a new employee stock ownership plan,
or ESOP, of 600,000 convertible preferred shares that would ensure
majority ownership by giving the new shares 10 votes each to one
vote each for the common shares.
   The preferred stock would not be traded. Employees upon
retirement could either sell it back to the company or convert it
into common shares the company said it would recycle into the ESOP.
   Employees could sell up to 35 percent of their common stock
publicly under the agreement, but they would have to retain the rest
until they retire or leave the company. Retirees could sell all
their stock.
   New employees would have to wait three years before they could
own stock.
   The 13-member board of directors would not change _ three members
each from management and the union and the other seven from outside
the company. Any issuance of new stock would require 90 percent
board approval.
   ``The company will have the economic basis to move forward with
major modernization. We have the opportunity to realize a bright
future,'' union president Virgil Thompson said.
   Last week, Weirton Chief Executive Officer Herbert Elish said the
company needs to invest $600 million over the next several years to
modernize its plant and keep it competitive.
   On Wednesday, the company said its 1989-92 plan calls for a major
renovation of its continuous slab caster to produce 100 percent cast
steel; completion of its hot mill renovations; and renovations in
its ironmaking blast furnaces and finishing mills.
   Weirton Steel employees purchased the plant in 1984 after the
owner, National Intergroup Inc., said it would invest no more money
in the facility.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday its
quarterly profit rose 48 percent, bouyed by sales of ``Cinderella''
in home video and by strong performances at its amusement parks.
   Disney said it earned $148.3 million, or $1.08 a share, in its
first quarter, ended Dec. 31, up from $100.4 million, or 73 cents a
share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter were
$1.04 billion, up from $734.6 million a year earlier.
   The Burbank-based entertainment company said both the profit and
sales figures were a record for its first quarter.
   First-quarter sales in Disney's theme parks and resorts division
rose to $511.6 million from $385.7 million a year earlier.
   Disney won't disclose attendance figures at Disneyland and Disney
World, but said results in the division were boosted by ``excellent
attendance'' and higher per-guest spending at its amusement parks
and resorts.
   First-quarter revenue in Disney's filmed entertainment segment
rose 38 percent, to $409.9 million from $297.8 million a year
earlier. The company attributed the rise to the popularity of such
movies as ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' and particularly to strong
sales of ``Cinderella'' in home video.
   The consumer products segment, growing as the company opens more
stores to sell Disney toys, clothes and memorabilia, had sales of
$122 million, up from $51 million a year earlier.

   The dollar slipped against most major currencies
Wednesday after the Federal Reserve again cut short a modest rally
with a round of dollar-selling.
   The Federal Reserve apparently acted alone, traders said, in
contrast to previous trading sessions in which the big European
central banks also sold dollars.
   The single-handed intervention, executed near the end of Europe's
trading day, was nevertheless successful in keeping the dollar in
check.
   ``It seemed to have a lot of effect for what was actually done.
The market has gotten edgy lately. Central banks have managed to
create an attitude of apprehension amongst traders who otherwise
would have been buying new dollars,'' said Frank Watson, a vice
president at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York.
   Some traders who are bullish toward the dollar said they would
wait for Friday's publication of U.S. preliminary gross national
product figures for the fourth quarter before attempting to bid up
the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.70 Japanese yen to a closing 127.65 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 127.75 yen. In New York the dollar fell to
127.43 yen from 127.70 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound rose against the dollar to $1.7710
from $1.7700 late Tuesday. Later in New York the pound rose to
$1.7708 from $1.7690 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8405 West German marks, down from 1.8415; 1.5630
Swiss francs, up from 1.5607; 1.1841 Canadian dollars, up from
1.822; 6.2553 French francs, down from 6.2617; and 1,345.5 Italian
lire, down from 1,347.5.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.8435 West German marks, up from 1.8395; 1.5670 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5523; 6.2715 French francs, up from 6.2335; 2.0820
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,350.50 Italian lire, up from
1,340.50; and 1.1840 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $404.25 a troy ounce from
$407 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to a bid
$404.25 from $407.10 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.42 to close at a bid $406.57.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed unchanged at $406 an ounce. Later, Republic National
Bank of New York said gold bullion edged up to $405.25 from $404.80.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market, where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $6.12 a troy ounce, compared with $6.21
bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $6.17 a troy ounce from $6.13 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBs last graf to CORRECT to ...Diet Pepsi at 5.2 percent.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. said Wednesday it had signed pop
star Madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said
would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television
commercial.
   Pepsi _ firing the latest volley in the newly escalating
marketing war with Coca-Cola Co. _ also will sponsor a planned world
tour by the actress-singer later in 1989 after the release of
Madonna's first album in three years, ``Like A Prayer.''
   The Madonna announcement comes on the heels of industry leader
Coke's new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of Diet Coke past
Pepsi, currently second in the market behind Coke Classic. That
effort marks the first time a major diet soda has squared off
directly against a leading sugared competitor, signaling a new
intensity in the years-old cola wars.
   Coke earlier this month signed pop singer George Michael for a
series of Diet Coke commercials, on top of a campaign already
featuring hockey star Wayne Gretzky, model Elle MacPherson and
``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, a one-time Pepsi pitchman.
   ``What's obviously shaping up is George Michael and Diet Coke
versus Madonna and sugar Pepsi,'' Coca Cola USA spokesman Anthony
Tortorici said. ``Frankly, we like those odds.''
   Terms of the Madonna contract were not disclosed, but if history
is any guide the deal with the brash singer of ``Like A Virgin'' and
star of the movie ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' should be in the
millions.
   Pepsi's award-winning ad campaigns featuring pop music began in
1984, when the number two soft-drink company signed Michael Jackson
and his brothers to a $5.5 million, one-year deal that was the
largest of its kind at the time.
   Two years later, Pepsi signed Jackson for a reported $10 million
to develop commercials over a three-year period. Rock stars Tina
Turner, David Bowie, Lionel Ritchie and the Miami Sound Machine also
have appeared in Pepsi ads.
   ``Pepsi has really pioneered the entire music marketing
phenomenon,'' Pepsi USA spokesman Tod MacKenzie said. ``People
expect us to be on top of what's new, what's hot and what's next.
Madonna is next.''
   ``I think we set the trend and others have followed,'' he said.
   Modeled as mini music videos, the Pepsi ads have taken the common
tactic of celebrity promotions a step further by using popular songs
as the center of a direct sales pitch.
   The Madonna deal adds another twist: using a commercial to debut
a song aimed at a popular audience.
   Pepsi said the title track to ``Like A Prayer'' would be heard
publicly for the first time in a commercial to be aired in prime
time early next month. The single is scheduled for release March 3
with the album to follow March 15, Warner Bros. spokesman Bob Merlis
said.
   ``I don't recall anyone orchestrating the debut of a new record
in a TV commercial,'' said Ken Barnes, editor of Radio and Records,
a music industry trade publication in Los Angeles. ``It's a new
stage in the marriage between commerce and the arts.''
   Barnes said pop songs long have emerged from commercials _
including the Carpenters' ``We've Only Just Begun,'' originally a
bank ad, and the recent British single ``The First Time'' by Robin
Beck, which was spun off a Coke commercial.
   ``But gearing an actual planned commercial release for a TV spot
I think is a new approach,'' he said.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft-drink business.
   According to the industry newsletter Beverage Digest, Coke
Classic topped all brands last year with 20.1 percent of domestic
sales. Pepsi was second with 18.7 percent, followed by Diet Coke at
8.2 percent and Diet Pepsi at 5.2 percent.

   The stock market gained more ground Wednesday,
extending Tuesday's runup to its highest levels since the crash of
1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 38.04
points on Tuesday, rose another 9.46 to 2,265.89.
   With four sessions to go in January, the average sports a gain of
better than 97 points since the start of the year.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
820 up, 648 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 183.61 million
shares, against 189.62 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 217.85 million shares.
   Analysts said the market lately has seemed to be emerging from
the long shadow cast by the crash.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest
level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a
big step in that direction.
   The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign
exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market.
   With all that, however, brokers said there remained many
skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase
after stocks at their current levels.
   If the day had a theme, it was upbeat earnings reports, sometimes
accompanied by dividend increases.
   For example, DuPont rose 2[ to 98{ on word from the company of
higher 1988 earnings, a dividend increase, and plans for a buyback
of as many as 20 million shares, or about 8 percent of the total
outstanding.
   Phelps Dodge gained 2} to 60|, trading at new 52-week highs. The
company posted sharply higher earnings for the fourth quarter and
raised its quarterly dividend from 40 to 60 cents a share.
   Upbeat earnings reports bolstered such other stocks as Walt
Disney, up { at 72, and Smithkline Beckman, up 1] at 52.
   On the downside, Amre suffered the day's biggest percentage loss,
tumbling 3{ to 6~. The company said it may post a loss of about $2
million for its current fiscal quarter, which ends next week.
   Cray Research, which spoke of significantly lower results for the
first quarter than the comparable period last year, fell 4\ to 60\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.07 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.34 to 162.33.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .73 to 333.99, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .65 at 289.14.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.04 to 394.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 319.50, up .76.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Up, Corn, Soybeans Lower, Oil Sharply Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spurred by export rumors, futures prices for wheat rose, but most
corn and soybean prices dipped Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   In other markets, meat and livestock futures mostly were higher;
precious metals rose and energy futures were sharply higher.
   Talk of impending developments from the Agriculture Department
drove wheat prices higher, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago
with G.H. Miller.
   After the closing bell, the USDA announced it has targeted the
Soviet Union for subsidized sales of 2 million more tons of wheat
under the export bonus program. The agency also said it had
increased from 16 million tons to 20 million tons the amount of U.S.
corn and wheat the USSR may purchase this year without new
consultations.
   Soybean prices pulled back, falling 18\ cents on the spot March
contract, because European markets didn't follow through on
Tuesday's rally in Chicago and it appeared the recent spurt of
commercial buying on meal sales was over, said Dale Gustafson, a
grains analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.39} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents
lower, with March at $2.70\ a bushel; oats were all 10 cents lower,
with March at $2.25\ a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 18\
cents lower with March at $7.49\ a bushel.
   Futures prices for livestock and meat were mostly higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The Agriculture Department's cold storage report, released
Tuesday, provided some boost to prices, because although record
inventories were set, the figures still were lower than expected.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in February at 72.90 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher, with January at 83.65
cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .53 cent higher,
with February at 43.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .98 cent higher, with February at 39.70 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for precious metals mostly higher were on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold and silver usually move in the opposite direction of the
U.S. dollar, and dollar was slightly lower Wednesday, said John
Jonat, metals trader for Deak International Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled unchanged to 10 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in January at $406 a troy ounce, and silver was 3.2 cents
to 4 cents higher, with January at $6.17 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures traded sharply higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Traders speculated that independent oil-producing nations might
soon follow OPEC's lead in curbing production. A group of
technicians from several independent producing nations is meeting in
London on Thursday with counterparts from several members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Crude oil settled 24 cents to 58 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $18.12 a barrel, and heating oil was 1.24
cents to 1.36 cents higher, with February at 52.51 cents a gallon.

   Dana Corp., a giant auto parts company, would
buy 82-year-old Champion Spark Plug Co. for about $600 million in
cash and stock under an agreement between the companies' managements
announced Wednesday.
   Investors pushed Champion's stock above Dana's offering price,
indicating the belief that a higher offer might emerge from Dana or
another bidder.
   The deal, which must be approved by Champion's shareholders,
would end the independence of the spark plug maker that has been
controlled by the Stranahan family since its founding in 1907.
   The two Toledo-based companies said the merger would unite
Champion's famous name with Dana's far-flung distribution system.
   Although not as well known as Champion, Dana is a bigger company,
with 1987 sales of $4.9 billion. It makes a variety of automotive
parts, including drive-train components, engine parts and chassis
products.
   Champion had sales of $554 million through the first nine months
of 1988.
   Champion's stock, already boosted by speculation of a merger,
rose 25 centsre in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading to
$18 a share, above Dana's offering price of $17.50 a share in cash
and stock.
   Dana fell $1.37{ a share in consolidated NYSE trading to $38.37{
a share.
   Under terms of the deal, Dana will make a $17.50-a-share cash
tender offer by Feb. 1 for 17.3 million shares of Champion common
stock, or about 50.1 percent of the stock on a fully diluted basis,
Champion spokesman Anthony Mougey said.
   After the merger the rest of Champion's stock would be exchanged
for cash or Dana stock with a value of $17.50 a share, with an
overall limit that no more than half of Champion's shares will be
bought for cash, the companies said.
   ``The combination of Dana and Champion will allow us to serve the
automotive, industrial and aviation markets with a unique
combination of well-recognized brand names and a distribution system
which is second to none,'' said Southwood Morcott, president of
Dana, a Toledo-based automotive parts company.
   O. Lee Henry, Champion's president and chief executive officer,
said the sale will strengthen both companies.
   ``Dana brands are very well respected in the marketplace, and the
Dana distribution system is state-of-the-art. We are looking forward
to working together and capitalizing on the strengths we each bring
to the combination,'' Henry said.
   Echlin Inc., a Branford, Conn. automotive parts company, had
reportedly made a bid to buy Champion last week, a rumor denied by
both companies. Echlin three years ago said it was interested in
purchasing Champion.
   Paul Ryder, Echlin's director of investor relations, declined
comment on whether the company would make an offer to buy Champion.
   ``Even if we were considering it I wouldn't be able to disclose
that information,'' he said.
   William Prebe, an auto industry analyst and former Dana vice
president and corporate economist, said the $17.50-a-share offer is
below what he believes the company's worth.
   ``We were looking for something in the neighborhood of $20, up to
$22-a share offer. The price suggests that it was a very friendly
composition between Dana and Champion,'' he said.
   Prebe said it is possible another company would make an counter
offer to buy Champion.
   ``You still have the bulk of the shares still traded on Wall
Street. If somebody wants to come in and get the remaining shares,
it would be a dirty fight that would raise the stock,'' he said.
   ``Now is the nervous time for the guy sitting on the sidelines.
He is thinking, `Should I take the $17.50 or go along with something
higher?' If nothing higher comes along and he hasn't taken the
$17.50, it may drop the stock down to $14, $15 dollars-a-share,'' he
said.
   Market interest in Champion increased with reports that members
of Chinook Partners L.P., holder of 35 percent of Champion's common
stock, might dissolve the partnership.
   Chinook was founded three years ago when descendants of the
company's founders, Frank and Robert Stranahan, decided to pool
their holdings to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs.
   The Stranahan family members set an expiration date for the
partnership of April 1, 1989, and analysts speculated that the
younger generation of the family was pushing to divest some of their
holdings.
   Champion's board of directors met in Toledo on Friday to discuss
what it would do if the Stranahans dissolved their family
partnership. The Chinook members met afterward. Neither group would
comment on the meetings.
   David Kubicki, a United Auto Workers union international
representative, said he was surprised by the deal.
   ``It's difficult to really digest what has taken place and what
the outcome and the future is going to be between the two parties,''
said Kubicki, a former UAW unit chairman at Dana's Toledo plant,
which has 340 workers.
   Champion earned $14.5 million, or 41 cents a share, on $554
million in sales during the first nine months of 1988, compared to
$12.9 million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $535 million in the
same period of 1987.
   Champion, which makes spark plugs and other automotive products,
employs about 10,000 people worldwide, including 2,250 workers at
its five U.S. and Canadian plants.
   Dana has 700 operations in 27 countries and employs about 35,000
workers.

<HEAD>Wall Street Reacts with Anger, Skepticism to Early Washington LBO
Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a Senate committee continued reviewing
leveraged buyouts and whether they should be restricted, Wall Street
deal makers reacted with anger and skepticism Wednesday about
proposals to curtail the popular method for financing corporate
acquisitions.
   ``They're trying to design a cure for something that has not been
a problem,'' said Tony James, a managing director at Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady suggested to the
Senate Finance Committee that tax deductions for corporate interest
payments be limited, while a new deduction for stock dividends be
created.
   At issue is whether the government wants to discourage the
buildup of huge amounts of corporate debt that are central to
leveraged buyouts, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s recent
record $24.53 billion agreement to buy RJR Nabisco Inc.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors go heavily into debt to buy out
a company. The company than pays off the debt with its cash flow or
by selling some of its assets.
   But deal makers questioned the feasibility of limiting LBO debt
and said it would be difficult to define how much of a firm's
interest payments are attributable to the cost of an acquisition.
   Joseph Bartlett, a partnr and LBO specialist at the law firm
Gaston &amp; Snow, said that even if LBO debt is limited acquirers would
find ways around the restrictions.
   ``Instead of borrowing, you will use sale-leasebacks. You say,
`This isn't debt anymore,''' he said.
   Bartlett also warned that too much tinkering with the corporate
acquisition process could lead to unintended _ and unwanted _
consequences, such as increased ownership of U.S. companies by
cash-rich foreigners.
   Past proposals to limit takeovers have had a devastating effect
on Wall Street. In October 1987, congressional committees approved
tax increase bills that some critics charged helped contribute to
the stock market crash that month. The House version included
provisions to sharply restrict the deduction for interest expenses
incurred in takeovers.
   But observers generally doubted anything substantive would come
out of this year's hearings.
   ``There'll be a lot of discussion, but in the end relatively
little action,'' said one principal in a major Wall Street
investment partnership who asked not to be identified.
   ``The only danger is that people get caught up in the theater of
it all and they have some obligation to show some results,'' he
said. ``That could be dangerous _ you could end up having stupid
policy made.''
   There may be skepticism now, but in 1988 deal makers who saw
changes in the law looming on the horizon weren't taking any chances.
   Last year brought a storm of buyouts and bids _ including the RJR
Nabisco deal _ and many securities analysts attributed the intense
activity to acquirers trying to wrap up takeovers while the Reagan
administration still was in office.
   The presidential election campaign brought a number of bipartisan
calls for more reins on corporate takeover activity.
   The feeling on Wall Street is that the hearings and proposals
have grown out of a backlash from the takeover battle for RJR
Nabisco.
   ``The politicians feel some negative reaction to the amount of
money being made on Wall Street and so there's a lot of curbing the
LBO trend or curbing the acquisition trend,'' said the investment
partnership principal.
   ``There is is sort of a public consensus to do something about
RJR Nabisco,'' said Bartlett. ``The problem is, in Washington they
haven't figured out what that something is.''
   Another criticism is that any action would not only affect the
big deals, but also the smaller, less highly-publicized buyouts that
the observers say have benefited the country.
   ``The buyout business isn't something new,'' said Edward Gibbons,
a principal with the investment firm Gibbons, Green van Amerongen.
``They've turned out to be fairly good investments over the years.''
   ``In not all, but in most cases, we've seen the productivity of
the businesses improve,'' he said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Convenes In Federal Probe of Futures Exchanges</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Merc announcing creation of
panel to control floor transactions; picks up pvs lede bg'ng, Defense attorneys
...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced creation
of a special panel Wednesday to strengthen control over floor
transactions as a federal grand jury convened to probe allegations
of fraud in the city's powerful financial futures industry.
   ``It matters not whether this (federal) investigation involves
one member, or many members, of the exchanges,'' said Leo Melamed,
chairman of the Merc's Executive Committee and special counsel to
the exchange's board of governors.
   ``What matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly
and make improvements where they are necessary,'' he added. ``There
will be no sacred cows.''
   The panel, which will be charged with reviewing trading
procedures and practices and recommending changes where necessary,
is made up of five industry officials and five former or current
public officials, among them former Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri.
   Earlier in the day, federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of
the downtown Everett Dirksen Federal Building _ which in the past
has been used for grand jury testimony _ and U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas, in keeping with office policy, declined even to confirm
that an investigation was under way.
   Meanwhile, several defense attorneys who advised clients to pass
up government deals in exchange for cooperation complained of
high-pressure prosecution tactics Wednesday as a federal grand jury
convened to probe allegations of fraud in Chicago's financial
futures industry.
   The complaints came a day after 200 subpoenas were served on
prominent brokers, traders and firms in a sweeping escalation of
Operation Sourmash, a federal undercover investigation of corruption
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade,
the world's largest futures exchanges.
   Federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtown
Everett Dirksen Federal Building _ which in the past has been used
for grand jury testimony _ and U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, in
keeping with office policy, declined even to confirm that an
investigation was under way.
   The investigation, conducted by undercover FBI agents posing as
traders, reportedly centers on allegations that up to 100 brokers
and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars via shady
dealings on the exchange floors.
   A number of well-known defense attorneys in Chicago said they had
been retained by traders at the two exchanges, and that subpoenas
carried return dates of Wednesday or Feb. 1.
   Several attorneys complained that federal prosecutors, who
accompanied FBI agents during late-night visits to some traders'
homes last week, made veiled threats of confiscating property and
other assets in hopes of enlisting the traders to cooperate, or
provide information about others.
   ``If the idea was to make some people sweat, they've accomplished
that,'' said a former federal prosecutor, who is now a defense
attorney and asked not be identified. ``But they might have gone too
far in some instances.
   ``People are used to thinking in terms of a conspiracy ... crimes
going up a ladder,'' said another attorney. ``What you really have
here appears to be a series of discreet acts that didn't stretch
beyond one or two people at a time.
   ``Building conspiracy and racketeering cases, and threatening to
throw the book at people isn't going to make small catches any
bigger.''
   But Philip Parenti, a former federal prosecutor now in private
practice, said the subpoenas may signal a different tack.
   ``They might have run out of people they they can squeeze
(information from) easily, and now they're looking for witnesses,
not talkers.
   ``From here on out, anybody who's got exposure and goes in to see
the grand jury is likely to be `immunized' or already has cut a
deal,'' he said. ``And it seems too early for either of those things
to have been done.''
   Initial news reports panicked trading circles and spurred quick
sales of seats on the two exchanges, but by Wednesday some of the
clouds cast by the probe over the two exchanges had dispersed.
   The exchanges reported sales of 32 full and associate seats
through midday Wednesday.
   Board of Trade spokesman Mark Prout said a trend that saw the
value of full seats slip steadily from $410,000 last Thursday to
$375,000 Monday had ended with a standing bid Wednesday to purchase
a seat at $383,000.
   ``I'd be careful to read anything into this, especially at this
early juncture,'' said Prout. ``There are many more things that can
move the markets than a pending investigation.''
   Similarly, trading volume in the soybean pits at the Board of
Trade and the currency futures pits at the Merc, both apparently
targeted by federal investigators, were consistent with
business-as-usual projections.
   Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Merc, said volume in
the currency trading pits Tuesday, the last day for which full
figures were available, totaled 143,698 contracts. That compared
with 170,112 contracts traded Thursday and 111,284 traded Monday.
   Prout said that trading in soybeans Tuesday totaled 37,223
contracts Tuesday, compared to 46,463 contracts traded Thursday and
32,313 traded Monday.

<HEAD>Shell, Texaco Report Modest Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s 1988 fourth-quarter earnings rebounded from a
multibillion dollar loss a year earlier, and Shell Oil Co.'s
fourth-quarter earnings tumbled 51.4 percent from a year earlier,
the petroleum giants said Wednesday.
   Texaco reported net income of $296 million, or $1.21 a share, in
the period, vs. a $4.67 billion in losses a year earlier attributed
to a restructuring and the settlement of a lawsuit with Pennzoil Co.
   Shell said earnings fell to $212 million in the quarter, down
from $436 million in the same 1987 period. The company does not
release per-share figures because it is a subsidiary of Royal Dutch
Shell based in The Netherlands.
   Shell President Frank Richardson said a recent rise in crude oil
prices helped exploration and production performance but put
pressure on refining and marketing costs.
   For the quarter ending Dec. 31, Texaco reported revenue of $8.47
billion, down 9.6 percent from $9.36 billion in revenue in the 1987
quarter.
   For the full year, the nation's third-largest oil company
reported earnings of $1.3 billion, or $5.35 a share, on revenue of
$35.1 billion, compared with losses of $4.14 billion on revenue of
$35.3 billion in 1987.
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said results from
exploration and production in 1988 were hurt by low crude prices for
most of the year and the loss of production in the North Sea after a
July platform explosion and fire.
   But financial results linked to oil refining and marketing were
positive because of lower crude oil acquisition costs, Texaco
President James W. Kinnear said.
   Houston-based Shell, the nation's sixth-largest oil company, said
revenues for the quarter were $5.5 billion, down 7.2 percent from
the $5.9 billion for the same year-ago period.
   For the year, Shell had net income of $1.24 billion, a slight
increase from the $1.23 billion in 1987. The annual earnings
included a positive $35 million cumulative effect from prior years
for accounting changes made in 1988, primarily for income taxes and
capitalization of interest.
   Revenues for all of 1988 were $21.4 billion, compared with $21.2
billion in 1987.

   Two Harvard-educated brothers are
struggling for control of the U-Haul rental empire founded by their
father, who pioneered the self-trucking idea at the end of World War
II and parlayed it into one of the country's biggest family-run
businesses.
   The squabble has made Samuel W. ``Sam'' Shoen and Edward J.
``Joe'' Shoen look like the Bobby and J.R. Ewing of do-it-yourself
moving. Both have allies among their 10 siblings and have sued each
other in state and federal courts.
   At stake is the destiny of an operation with about 13,000
employees, $1 billion in annual revenue and a rental fleet of more
than 100,000 trailers and 64,000 trucks, emblazoned with the
orange-and-gray U-Haul logo commonly seen on interstates nationwide.
   The faction led by Joe Shoen, a 40-year-old attorney with a
Harvard MBA, currently runs U-Haul and its parent company, Amerco,
which also has interests in other rental equipment, self-storage
facilities and insurance. The company is incorporated in Nevada but
most of its operations are based in Arizona.
   Joe Shoen and his allies won control via a stock maneuver last
summer that gave them 53 percent voting power, partly through the
issuance of shares to non-family executives who were on their side.
   The rival faction is led by Sam Shoen, 43, a physician who also
has an MBA from Harvard. He quit as company president last summer
because of frustration with family squabbling.
   He has since challenged the legality of his younger brother's
stock maneuver, calling it a shabby move that cheated him and other
shareholders.
   Sam Shoen's group is supported by patriarch Leonard S. Shoen, 71,
who had always wanted his eldest son to run U-Haul and has expressed
dismay at what is happening to his family and the business under Joe
Shoen's hand.
   He now believes the entire company should be sold and knows of a
buyer willing to pay $1 billion, he said in an interview. He
wouldn't identify the buyer.
   ``My son Joe, I think, is incompetent,'' the U-Haul founder told
The Associated Press by telephone this past week from his home in
Las Vegas. ``I'm not very pleased with his behavior.''
   Sam Shoen said in an interview that his father was a genius who
had taken the company through four decades of impressive growth,
only to be undone by his children's rivalries.
   ``There's nothing very mysterious here,'' Sam Shoen said. ``I'm
not going to imply that anybody has these particular problems, but
the problems are power, control and greed.''
   He said Leonard Shoen's weakness was the generosity that had
prompted him to give each of his 12 children shares amounting to 95
percent of the stock in Amerco.
   ``My father had a dream, and his dream was that he would create
this company, which he did, pass it on to his children, which he
did, and that the children would work together, which they did for a
time, and that it would be passed on to his grandchildren.
   ``It was a wonderful dream, but I don't know of a single case
where it's ever worked, not with the kind of ownership dispersion we
have,'' Sam Shoen said.
   The company's leadership is now so convoluted, he said, that he
also wants to sell it despite what he called the sentimental value
attached to his father's American success story.
   Gary V. Klinefelter, Amerco's secretary and general counsel,
declined to arrange interviews with Joe Shoen or other members of
the controlling faction until the outcome of court proceedings. But
Klinefelter claimed Joe Shoen's move to take control was crucial for
the company's survival.
   Leonard Shoen struck a responsive chord in the American psyche in
1945, introducing a fleet of rental trailers about the time many
soldiers and sailors were returning home and looking for jobs around
the country.
   For many years U-Haul grew with almost no competition, operating
out of franchised service stations. In 1968, Shoen moved from
Ridgefield, Wash., where he started U-Haul, to the Southwest, basing
the key operations in Phoenix.
   Things started to get tougher for him in 1973, when the oil
crisis crimped vehicle use. Meanwhile, the U-Haul fleet was aging,
zoning laws began restricting the location of rental trailers, and
competitors began muscling in on the company's dominance.
   Complicating matters were the Shoen descendants themselves, who
by this decade had started vying for voices in the company. Unable
to control it anymore, the father retired in the fall of 1986. Some
say he was forced out by vindictive children.
   In Klinefelter's view, Joe Shoen helped save the business by
reducing the average vehicle age to 7 years from 17 years, doubling
the number of North American dealers to 7,500, scrapping a
money-losing, full-service moving van venture and introducing a new
1-ton Toyota pickup truck rental.
   The parent company is en route to record profits of $50 million
on $1 billion in revenues for the 1988 fiscal year that began last
April 1, Klinefelter said.
   The Shoen family ties had eroded long before the squabbling
turned legal, he said.
   ``This has been a very decentralized family,'' he said. ``The
range of ages of these children is 21 to 43, with two different
mothers. Then there is a minor child by a third mother.''
   Sam Shoen said his brother's group had done nothing unusual or
innovative. He claimed their father started the modernization.
   ``The whole thing is a process,'' he said. ``It's just replacing
older vehicles with newer ones.''
   The underlying dispute, he said, ``is whether a minority of
shareholders can issue stock to disenfranchise a majority. It's that
simple.''
   Despite the Shoen family feud, the company hasn't been hurt, at
least not yet, securities analysts who follow transportation
companies say.
   ``I don't think there is any linkage between the family squabbles
and the company's customer bases and demand for their product,''
said Thomas Trantum, who follows a key U-Haul competitor, Ryder
System Inc., for the J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. investment concern.
   ``Customers are interested in the state of the equipment and the
price,'' Trantum said. ``They just want to move from here to there.
You just go to a couple of outlets, check the prices and give the
tires a kick. Then you take the best deal.''

<HEAD>Little Resigns as President of Newsweek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Newsweek Inc., Christopher M.
Little, has resigned unexpectedly to become president of Cowles
Magazines Inc., which publishes history magazines and books, it was
announced Wednesday.
   Little, 47, had been president of Newsweek for the past 2{ years,
and said he is taking the new job because of his interest in history
and the chance to live closer to his Virginia farm. His resignation
is effective March 1.
   The Washington Post Co., parent of Newsweek, named no replacement
for Little.
   ``I am surprised and disappointed to lose this able manager and
colleague who has accomplished so much for Newsweek,'' said Richard
D. Simmons, president of Washington Post Co.
   Simmons said operating profits at Newsweek, a weekly
newsmagazine, rose dramatically in 1988 and that circulation is at
the highest level in history. Newsweek circulation rose to 3.315
million in 1988, up from 3.097 million when Little took over as
president.
   Little joined Washington Post Co. in 1976 as a lawyer for the
Washington Post newspaper, and later became publisher of The Herald,
the company's newspaper in Everett, Wash.
   He moved to Newsweek as chief financial officer five years ago
and was named president of Newsweek in 1986, succeeding Mark
Edmiston who resigned.
   Simmons said Gerard Smith, Newsweek vice chairman, and Howard W.
Smith, publisher, would report to him.
   Cowles Magazines, based in Harrisburg, Pa., publishes 14
magazines, including 10 history titles with combined circulation
exceeding 1 million. It also owns National Historical Society, which
publishes history books.
   Cowles Magazines is a unit of Cowles Media Co., a Minneapolis
concern controlled by the Cowles family trust.
   In a telephone interview, Little said Cowles executives
approached him about whether he would be interested in the job.
Cowles Magazines president Jim Keough recently resigned.
   Little, who said he is a history buff, said the job will enable
him to live closer to his farm in Highland County, Virginia.
   ``I'm not somebody principally interested in prestige or
necessarily even money,'' he said.
   Little said his decision to leave Newsweek has nothing to do with
periodic speculation that Washington Post was considering selling
Newsweek.
   Little said Post officials have no such plans. Guyon Knight, a
spokesman for Washington Post, said the periodic sale rumors ``are
totally untrue.''

<HEAD>Bethlehem Reports Fourth Quarter Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. Wednesday reported an 8
percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings, largely because of costs
associated with rehabilating one plant and selling or shutting down
others.
   Specialty steelmaker Lukens Inc., meanwhile, said Wednesday it
enjoyed the best three months in company history with a 46 percent
increase in fourth-quarter earnings from $6.6 million, or 78 cents
per share, to $9.6 million, or $1.12 per share.
   Fourth-quarter earnings for Bethlehem, the nation's third-largest
steelmaker, fell from $71.5 million, or $1.07 per share, in 1987 to
$65.7 million, or 79 cents per share. Sales climbed 10 percent from
$1.20 billion to $1.33 billion.
   Bethlehem charged $35 million against fourth-quarter earnings to
reflect increased operating costs at its Burns Harbor plant in
Indiana, where it rehabilitated a blast furnace.
   The company also took a $55 million charge to reflect losses on
the sale of its remaining Kentucky coal operations and for costs
associated with previous plant shutdowns.
   In 1988, a good year throughout the steel industry, the company
earned $403 million, or $4.32 per share, up from $174.3 million, or
$2.77 per share, in 1987. Sales rose from $4.62 billion to $5.49
billion.
   Bethlehem lost a total of more than $2 billion in the five years
from 1982 through 1986.
   Lukens' quarterly sales rose 16.5 percent from $133.5 million to
$155.6 million.
   The Coatesville, Pa. company also set records with annual profits
of $33.4 million, or $3.91 per share, up 54 percent from $21.6
million, or $2.58 per share in 1987. Sales rose 20 percent from
$505.2 million to $605.3 million.
   ``Healthy shipments, near-capacity operating rates and increased
transaction prices more than offset rising scrap prices,'' said
Lukens Chairman W.R. Wilson.
   Bethlehem Chairman Walter F. Williams predicted a profitable
first quarter this year but no surge in demand.
   ``We anticipate that steel consumption will remain relatively
flat, and domestic steel shipments will decline since customers are
not expected to build steel inventories as they did in 1988,'' he
said.
   Williams projected 1989 industry shipments at 77 million tons,
down from the estimated 83 million tons shipped in 1988.
   ``We face a number of issues in 1989 which must be satisfactorily
resolved if we are to continue our progress in achieving sustained
profitability and rebuilding a sound financial base,'' Williams said.
   ``We must negotiate a ... new agreement which will permit
Bethlehem to continue to remain competitive with other steel
producers both domestic and foreign,'' Williams said.
   Bethlehem's contract with the United Steelworkers union expires
July 21.
   The major producers are also pressing President Bush to fulfill
his promise to renew the five-year voluntary steel import quotas due
to expire in September.
   ``We are relying on that commitment,'' Williams said. ``The basic
international conditions that required the policy _ excessive global
capacity in steel and unfair trade in our market _ have not been
corrected.''
   He said a five-year extension of the policy is essential.
   ``The steel industry has not yet achieved an adequate and
sustained level of profitability,'' Williams said.

   Sales of existing single-family homes last year
hit their highest level since 1979 as buyers shopped in lower price
ranges rather than leave the market when costs rose, a real estate
trade group said Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said 3.63 million homes were
sold in 1988, up 2.9 percent from 1987 when 3.53 million homes had
been sold. It was the highest sales volume since 3.83 million homes
were sold in 1979.
   Sales shot up 11.4 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 4.09 million units. It was the highest month-to-month
increase since an 11.6 percent rise in April 1986.
   ``For the most part, people seem to be buying less-expensive
homes,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the Realtors group. ``The
demand is there. People still appear to be going for the most they
can afford. They just can't afford as much.''
   Home prices slipped slightly to $87,700 in December compared with
a median sales price of $88,000 in November. Prices averaged $89,100
for all of 1988, a 4.1 percent increase from the previous year, when
the median sales price was $85,600.
   ``The strong sales volume of December, combined with a decline in
prices from November and overall modest price increases for the
year, suggest that the demand for home ownership is being fulfilled
at the lower end of the market,'' said John Tuccillo, chief
economist for the Realtors.
   He predicted similar buying patterns this year, but cautioned
that with mortgage interest rates expected to continue rising,
``economic conditions are not favorable to draw a large volume of
sales.''
   Interest on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.71 percent last
week, according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Economist Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions credited the strong 1988 home sales to the general
health of the nation's economy.
   ``There is an underlying demand for housing that's fueled by
visions of home ownership but also by the economic reality of an
economy still in its expansion phase,'' he said. ``Relatively good
economic conditions are, at bottom, what's responsible for a fairly
strong level of homes sales despite slightly higher interest rates.''
   He predicted there would be a slight decline in home sales during
1989 as interest rates continue to rise early in the year and
economic growth slows later in the year.
   Prices were up in 1988 in all regions of the country, with the
fastest rate increase coming in the West, where prices rose 9.3
percent from 1987 to reach a median of $123,700 last year.
   The Northeast continued to have the highest sales prices of any
region, a median of $143,100 in 1988, up 7.4 percent from a year
earlier.
   Home prices rose 2.4 percent in the South to a median of $82,300
in 1988, while prices were up 3.5 percent in the Midwest to a median
of $68,300.
   The 11.4 percent sales increase nationwide in December followed
two months where sales held even at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.67 million units.
   Tuccillo said the figures revealed a shift in purchases from the
more expensive Northeast to less-costly markets in the Midwest and
South.
   December's increase in sales was led by a 15.8 percent increase
in the South, where sales ose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.61 million homes. Sales were up 10.4 percent in the Midwest,
where an economic revival is under way, to an annual rate of 1.06
million homes.
   In the West, sales rose 4.5 percent to 690,000 units, and sales
were up 4.4 percent in the Northeast to 710,000 dwellings.

<HEAD>President Of SmithKline Beckman Resigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. said Wednesday its
president has resigned amid differences over the direction of the
giant health care company at a time it is faced with sagging sales
of its blockbuster ulcer drug and takeover rumors.
   George W. Ebright's resignation coincided with the release of
SmithKline's earnings, which showed a 60 percent drop in the
company's 1988 profit.
   Ebright's resignation is effective immediately, the company said.
His duties will be assumed by Henry Wendt, SmithKline's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``George and I have had differences on matters of corporate
policy. Nevertheless, I accept his resignation with deep regret,''
Wendt said in a prepared statement. He added that Ebright ``has
played a major role in the diversification of SmithKline Beckman and
the building of our businesses.''
   SmithKline said its fourth-quarter net income rose 12 percent to
$159.4 million, or $1.28 a share, from $141.9 million, or $1.14 a
share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose to $1.3 billion from
$1.2 billion in the 1987 period.
   The fourth-quarter figures were bolstered by income from the
partial spinnoff of Beckman Instruments, which brought in $46.1
million, the company said.
   Analysts said Ebright's abrupt resignation probably stemmed from
differences with Wendt over the future direction of the company.
   ``Mr. Ebright was probably in favor of retaining control at the
top and Mr. Wendt was probably in favor of more independence of the
units,'' said Ronald M. Nordmann, a stock analyst with PaineWebber.
   Ebright, who also was chief operating officer, stood to loose
responsibility with any independence given to the individual units,
Nordmann said.
   Ebright, 51, who became president April 1987, joined the company
in 1963 in the accounting department. Wendt, 55, became chairman the
same month, 32 years after joining SmithKline's international
marketing division.
   SmithKline ``has strong managers in place at the corporate level
and in our operating units, and I am confident of their ability to
lead our business into the future,'' Wendt said.
   Management has been under fire from critics who charge SmithKline
has failed to introduce a follow-up to its leading prescription
ulcer medication, Tagamet, as it has faced increased competition
from London-based Glaxo Holdings's Zantac.
   On the year, SmithKline's profit fell 60 percent to $229.2
million, or $1.84 a share, from $570.1 million, or $4.50 a share,
the company reported. Its sales rose 10 percent to $4.7 billion from
$4.3 billion in 1987.
   The yearly figures included a $389.3 million charge associated
with a corporate restructuring announced in September.
   Pharmaceutical sales were down 14 percent in the fourth quarter,
with Tagamet and high-blood pressure medication Dyazide sales
described as being down ``sharply.'' Tagamet's sales for the year
were $1.020 billion.
   A number of Wall Street analysts have labled SmithKline a
takeover target and, largely on the basis of rumors of an imminent
offer, its stock has fluctuated widely in the past months.
   The company's stock price was up 12.5 cents to 50| Tuesday and in
early trading today went up $1.25. The company's breakup value has
been estimated at $75 to $91 per share.
   The restructuring announced in September was viewed by many
analysts as an attempt to fend off possible suitors.
   But many said the partial spinoff of Beckman Instruments was not
enough and Wendt hinted in September that similar steps might be
applied to their Allergan and SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories
subsidiaries.
   The company has said partial spinoffs would focus stock market
attention on the value of the subsidiaries and, thus, increase
SmithKline's value.
   Analysts said today's resignation likely signals more partial
spinoffs within the corporation. Allergan and SmithKline Bio-Science
Laboratories are likely candidates for such a move.

<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co.'s board of directors on
Wednesday authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of
common stock in an effort to improve the stock's value, the company
announced.
   At the current value of Du Pont stock, the purchase would be
worth around $2 billion. The proposed purchase represents about 8
percent of the company's common shares.
   Du Pont's stock rose $2.12{ to $98.50 a share Wednesday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The board also declared a first-quarter dividend of $1.05 per
share on outstanding common stock, an increase of 10 cents from the
dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 1988. The dividend was last
raised nine months ago.
   Under the repurchasing program, shares will be bought on the open
market, or through privately negotiated transactions, at prevailing
market rates from time to time.
   ``This buyback program is another step in our efforts to improve
the overall return to shareholders without jeopardizing our
financial strength or sacrificing growth opportunities that may
present themselves,'' said Chairman Richard E. Heckert.
   As of Dec. 31, 1988, Du Pont had 239.4 million shares of common
stock outstanding.

<HEAD>Marshall Allows Resumption of GAF Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice on Wednesday allowed
the resumption of a stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its
vice chairman.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall lifted an order he issued Sunday that
temporarily halted the trial.
   GAF, based in Wayne, N.J., and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin are
accused by the federal government of attempting to manipulate the
common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale
of a large block of Carbide stock in November 1986.
   A trial in the case began in December in New York City but ended
in a mistrial on a motion by defense lawyers. U.S. District Judge
Mary Johnson Lowe ruled that a prosecutor improperly, but
unintentionally, withheld a report that key evidence had been
altered.
   A retrial began last week. But while jury selection was under
way, lawyers for GAF asked Marshall to block it on grounds that the
defendants' double jeopardy rights against being tried twice for the
same alleged crime were violated.
   Marshall, in an unusual move, ordered an interruption in the jury
selection Sunday while he studied arguments on the double jeopardy
issue. He issued a brief order Wednesday withdrawing the earlier
order.
   The Justice Department argued that retrying GAF and Sherwin is
permitted under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that said double
jeopardy rights are violated in such cases only when the prosecution
intends to provoke a defendant into seeking a mistrial.

<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. official James R. Paul said
Wednesday that Texas Eastern Corp.'s invitation to possible buyers
is a ploy to delay Coastal's attempted $260 billion takeover bid and
that the company's main goal is to remain independent.
   ``I think they're stalling to see whether they can find another
alternative and they're holding some remote hope of remaining
independent. I think their principal objective has been to remain
independent,'' said Paul, president and chief operating officer at
Coastal.
   ``They talk about studying the idea of auctioning the company,
but they haven't said they're going to do it. In fact, to date they
haven't taken any specific action except to stall,'' Paul said.
   However, Texas Eastern officials said Wednesday they already have
started scheduling appointments witth possible buyers, and denied
Paul's suggestion that their contacts with more than 50 possible
suitors is meant to delay a Coastal takeover by propping up stock
prices.
   ``The process is well under way,'' said Texas Eastern spokesman
Fred Wichlep. ``We have set up data rooms here in our building and
have already started making appointments with representatives of
other companies to come in and review our data and to hear
presentations by officers of the company,'' he said.
   Trading in Texas Eastern was suspended briefly on the New York
Stock Exchange Tuesday after a company lawyer told U.S. District
Judge Lynn N. Hughes the company might use a ``white knight'' to
block the Coastal bid and has a list of more than 50 possible buyers.
   Coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed
to inflate stock prices and make their $42-a-share offer appear
inadequate.
   Texas Eastern officials say the number is legitimate and was
provided in court only to inform Hughes of their actions, but they
acknowledge that they are trying to maximize stock values.
   ``This is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine
the maximum value of Texas Eastern stock,'' Wichlep said Wednesday.
   During the three-hour court hearing Tuesday, Hughes denied a
Texas Eastern request to delay a Feb. 7 hearing date in a Coastal
lawsuit designed to prevent Texas Eastern from using any
anti-takeover measures.
   Wichlep said Texas Eastern would not discuss the number of
companies planning visits to the company's Houston headquarters or
when they were expected. All companies are being asked to sign
confidentiality agreements, he said.
   Analysts and industry officials expressed doubt Wednesday that
there may be a large number of serious contenders to take over the
Houston-based natural gas company. Panhandle Eastern Corp., Arkla
Inc., Consolidated Natural Gas and Burlington Resources all have
reportedly turned down requests to enter the bidding.
   Houston-based Enron Corp., which operates the nation's largest
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a
possible candidate for a Texas Eastern takeover, will not say
whether it is talking to the company.
   Others cited as possible suitors include Houston-based Pennzoil
and Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla. British Petroleum PLC's BP America
is said to have an interest in Texas Eastern's considerable oil and
natural gas reserves in the North Sea.
   Paul said his company has asked Texas Eastern for information
that would justify a higher offer than its $42-a-share cash bid, but
said the only response has been ``rhetoric and a stonewall meeting
last Sunday.''
   The meeting between executives of the two Houston-based natural
gas companies was the only face-to-face contact to occur since
Coastal's takeover bid was announced Jan. 16.

   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it planned to start

   The airline said a new bilateral accord between the United States

   Eastern also is to increase its weekly flights between New York

<HEAD>Conrail's Net Income Dips Slightly In Quarter With Loss Of Tax Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Rail Corp., better known as
Conrail, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings dipped slightly
from the previous year but that its profit for all of 1988 rose 2
percent.
   The company reported net income of $78 million, or $1.13 per
share, in the final quarter of 1988 compared with $79 million, or
$1.15 a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 7.6 percent to $904 million from $840
million in 1987.
   Discounting the tax benefits carried over from the company's
previous ownership by the government, Conrail said it had earned $75
million, or $1.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. The
government sold the railroad in a public offering March 1987.
   ``Last October, we cautioned that it would be difficult to match
our fourth-quarter 1987 performance, which had benefitted from
substantial increases in coal and steel traffic. In fact, we
registered a solid quarter, essentially equaling traffic volume,''
said Richard D. Sanborn, Conrail chairman and chief executive
officer.
   For the year, Conrail reported it earned $306 million, or $4.44
per share, on revenues of $3.49 billion, up from net income of $299
million, or $4.34 per share, on revenues of $3.25 billion in 1987.
   The company's profits in 1987, however, were enhanced by capital
loss tax credits and depreciation deductions.
   In light of the discontinued tax benefits, the company posted a
22.4 percent increase over 1987 net income of $250 million, or $3.62
per share.
   ``Our continued strong performance in 1988 shows our ability to
attract and transport higher volumes of freight traffic, while
continuing to control costs,'' Sanborn said.
   The company carried 0.4 percent more freight in the fourth
quarter of 1988, compared with the same period for 1987, Conrail
said. For the year, traffic was up 6.2 percent, the company said.

<HEAD>Deal To Sell CNN Center Falls Through But Talks Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said Wednesday a
letter of intent to sell its headquarters building, CNN Center in
downtown Atlanta, to a New Jersey real estate firm has expired
without completion of the sale.
   ``It is unfortunate that this transaction was not completed on
schedule,'' said Paul D. Beckham, TBS senior vice president of
finance and administration.
   ``Nonetheless, we have been continuing to talk with 66 Properties
Inc. (a unit of The Herrick Co., a Morristown, N.J.-based real
estate investment firm) and it remains the intent of the company to
sell CNN Center on the appropriate terms,'' he said.
   The signing of the letter of intent was announced Nov. 7. The
sale was to have been closed within about 60 days at a price of
about $170 million.
   The price is nearly three times the amount TBS paid for the Omni
International complex in 1986, later renaming it after its Cable
News Network.
   TBS purchased the property for $21.8 million in cash and the
assumption of $45 million in debt.
   In announcing the deal, TBS Chairman Ted Turner said the profit
would be used to pay down some of the debt TBS incurred in the $1.4
billion purchase of the MGM film library in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Squibb Corp. said Wednesday it had a 15.2
percent increase in its fourth-quarter earnings compared to the
previous year.
   The drug manufacturer said it earned $97.5 million, or $1 a
share, in the fourth quarter compared with $84.6 million, or 81
cents per share, in the same period in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose 12 percent to $664.8 million from
$592.6 million in 1987.
   For the year, earnings rose 19 percent to $425.5 million, or
$4.30 a share, compared with $358.4 million, or $3.42 a share, in
1987. Sales for the year rose 20 percent to $2.6 billion from $2.2
billion in 1987.
   Richard M. Furlaud, chairman and chief execuutive, attributed the
increases to higher sales of Capoten, a drug used to treat
hypertension and heart failure.
   Sales of Capoten rose to more than $1 billion in 1988, a
first-time achievement for Squibb, Furlaud said.
   Sales of four other drugs _ Capozide, Corgard, Isovue and Azactam
_ also exceeded $100 million in annual sales, he said.

<HEAD>Big S&amp;L Predicts Loss; Discusses FSLIC Supervision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The parent of Gibraltar Savings said
Wednesday it expected to lose more than $30 million in its latest
quarter, and revealed it is discussing a supervisory agreement with
federal thrift regulators.
   Gibraltar, one of the nation's biggest savings and loans, has
been losing money for at least two years, in part because of
expansion into commercial lending and real estate development.
   Gibraltar Financial Corp., holding company for the thrift, said
losses in the quarter ended Dec. 31 are expected to be between $30
million and $35 million. Losses for the year will mount to between
$71 million and $76 million, the company said.
   Gibraltar revealed that regulators from the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board have ordered it to draw up a plan to boost its capital,
and have barred it from entering new business until the plan is
submitted.
   Gibraltar said it is discussing entering a supervisory agreement
with the Bank Board, under which regulators' approval would have to
be sought for major decisions.
   A Bank Board spokesman refused to discuss the company's position,
citing confidentiality rules. Publicly held companies like Gibraltar
are required to disclose such information because of its effect on
the price of their stock.
   James N. Thayer, president and chief executive officer of
Gibraltar Financial Corp., the holding company, blamed current
problems on the institution's big portfolio of fixed-rate loans. The
company's income from those loans is outpaced by the amount it must
pay in interest to short term depositors.
   ``That is a devastating combination in a period, such as the
present one, when short-term rates rise sharply,'' Thayer said in a
news release.
   At the end of June, Gibraltar Savings had assets of $13.2 billion.

<HEAD>Baltimore Daily Announces Electronic Integration of Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Baltimore Sun announced plans Wednesday for a
fully computerized production system by 1992 that an analyst said
would make it the nation's most technologically advanced newspaper.
   Pagination, as the process is called, will eliminate the need for
typesetting, layout and paste-up operations and allow faster, more
efficient handling of news and better picture quality.
   The newspaper has chosen Crosfield Electronic, a computer systems
developer, to install the full-color electronic publishing system
for $13.5 million.
   If it is successful, the Sun would be the first newspaper in the
country to have complete pagination, according to John Morton, a
Washington-based newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.
   Many newspapers have plans for full pagination and a few already
are using the process for classified advertising, Morton said.
   All words _ stories, headlines, photo captions, advertising copy,
etc. _ will be written, edited and positioned on a dummy page on a
computer terminal.
   Photographs need not be produced as prints in a darkroom. In
technology known as electronic darkrooms, images are stored as
electrical impulses that can be enlarged or shrunk, cropped,
lightened or darkened on a terminal.
   Pagination is just the latest in a series of evolutionary changes
in the printing industry, which not so long ago relied on hot lead
type that was melted and reused for each edition.
   ``It will spell the end of what's left of the composing room,''
Morton said.
   Richard M. Basoco, the Sun's senior vice president and general
manager, said the system will eliminate two-thirds of the current
150 composing room jobs, significantly reducing labor costs.
   However, workers' contracts guarantee them lifetime job security,
so employment will be reduced only through attrition. Remaining
workers will be offered transfers and retraining.
   Eugene Bannister, vice chairman of International Typographers
Union Local 12 at the Sun, said pagination was inevitable.
``Automation is trial and error,'' Bannister said. ``They might talk
about pagination but who knows whether it's going to work.''
   Basoco said the new system, combined with new color presses,
would enable the Sun to increase its use of color and to produce
itself the work on its Sunday magazine now performed by jobbers.
   Crosfield, of Glen Rock, N.J., is the North American operation of
Crosfield Electronics Ltd., an English company owned by De La Rue
Co., the world's largest nongovernment currency and security printer.
   The Baltimore Sun, part of the Times Mirror Co., publishes the
Sun and the Evening Sun, with a combined circulation of 407,000 and
the 476,000-circulation Sunday Sun.

   A West German newspaper says a subsidiary of
Bechtel Group Inc. provided financing for an Iraqi poison gas
factory in the mid-1980s and 30 Soviet experts helped build it.
   Rick Laubscher, spokesman for the American company, said: ``It's
an outrageous lie. Bechtel did not build, design or finance anything
of the kind in Iraq during that period.
   ``We have never participated in any such project, nor would we
ever.''
   The left-leaning West Berlin newspaper Tageszeitung, in a report
released Wednesday and scheduled for publication Thursday, said it
had a list of 31 foreign companies and 18 banks and financial
institutions allegedly involved.
   Tageszeitung said it obtained the list from the United Kurdish
Front, a group opposed to the Iraqi government. It said the list was
compiled by an official Iraqi agency.
   In addition to Bechtel, the newspaper said the list contained
names of companies in West Germany, Belgium, France, Brazil, Italy,
Britain, Yugoslavia and Switzerland that ``directly or indirectly
participated'' in building a mustard gas plant in Iraq.
   Seven West German companies were named in the report, but Bechtel
was the only name of a foreign firm included.
   According to Tageszeitung, Bechtel Financing Services ``in
cooperation with Britain's Midland Bank, helped finance the
building'' of the plant beginning in 1984. The site was given as
Akashat, 240 miles southeast of Baghdad near the Jordanian border.
   Iraq officially described it as a ``facility for producing
fertilizers and pesticides,'' the paper said, but ``in reality,
mustard gas was produced there.''
   The Kurdish group has a list of 30 Soviet experts and engineers
who helped with the facility, Tageszeitung reported.
   It said the Soviet Union also provided technology, but quoted
Kremlin arms expert Viktor Karpov as denying Soviet involvement.
   ``The firm policy of the Soviet Union is not to help any country
in developing, producing or acquiring chemical weapons,'' he was
quoted as telling the paper in Geneva.

   President Bush said Wednesday his
administration is considering charging depositors to help pay for
the savings and loan crisis, but members of his own party in
Congress quickly stuck a pin in the trial balloon.
   ``I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but that is one
option,'' Bush said in an interview with two reporters.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in television interviews
Wednesday morning, said a proposal under review by his department
would impose an insurance fee of 25 cents for every $100 in
deposits. But, he stressed that the option has not been forwarded
yet to Bush.
   Brady did not say how the fee would be collected, but his
spokesman, Arthur Siddon, said the fee could be imposed directly on
depositors, or it could be paid by the institutions as an increase
in the insurance premium they already pay.
   The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insured
financial institutions: banks, S&amp;Ls and credit unions, Siddon said.
   Meantime, the General Accounting Office is preparing a report
which says that some of the nation's largest accounting firms failed
to uncover fraud and mismanagement at S&amp;Ls, The Washington Post
reported in its Thursday editions.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, examined the audits
of a dozen failed S&amp;Ls which were given ``clean audits'' _ meaning
no problems were found _ shortly before the S&amp;Ls went under, the
newspaper said.
   Bush, in an interview, appeared to dispute a suggestion the fee
could be considered a tax, thus violating his ``Read my lips: No new
taxes'' pledge.
   ``I will answer the question with a question. Is (it) a tax when
the person pays the fee to go to Yosemite Park, using the park? ...
There will be a lively debate on this,'' Bush said.
   John Sununu, White House chief of staff, said an increase in
deposit insurance premiums ``does not pass the duck test and
therefore is not a tax.'' Sununu was referring to a statement by
Budget Director Richard Darman, who told Congress that if a proposed
revenue increase was widely perceived by the public as a tax
increase it would not be proposed, saying, ``If it looks like a duck
... it's a duck.''
   Sununu suggested that the option under consideration could be
considered a ``modernization'' of deposit insurance premiums, which
historically have proved to be too low.
   Federal regulators pledged more than $38 billion last year to
close 205 insolvent S&amp;Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutions
remain open and billions of dollars more will be required.
   The Treasury Department is working on a plan for Bush that would
raise money and institute reforms to prevent the problem from
reoccurring. Sununu said Bush could select a plan as early as next
week.
   Members of Congress said they have been contacted by Treasury
Department officials over the last week or so seeking their reaction
to a variety of money-raising ideas.
   One option would impose a user fee on mortgage borrowers. Others
involve various ways to borrow the money, either on or off budget,
with the Treasury paying the interest.
   But the deposit fee option, reported in Wednesday editions of The
Washington Post, stirred a furor in the industry and in Congress.
   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said the fee could raise
$9 billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $20
billion to $30 billion the government will have to raise for several
years.
   ``The thing is dead on arrival for one reason: It puts an
imposition of a burden on the depositor and creates an unlevel
playing field against insured financial institutions,'' said Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., a senior member of the House Banking Committee.
   ``I haven't found one member who thought it had any merit,''
Parris said, warning that the fee could send deposits flowing into
money market mutual funds and other uninsured investments offered by
brokerage firms.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., a senior member of the Senate banking
panel, called the idea ``incredibly ill-advised.''
   ``I will only vote for this idea posthumously and only then if
someone casts by proxy against my direct wishes expressed in my last
will and testament,'' Heinz said.
   ``I think it's one of the more absurd ideas that has come down
the pike,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a banking committee
member. ``At a time when we're trying to encourage people to save,
to penalize them is nonsensical. ... Politically it's going to be
blown out of the water.''
   However, other members of Congress said the trial balloon should
not be summarily dismissed.
   ``I think it underscores how bad all the alternatives are,'' said
Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa. ``The nature of the solutions is they are
going to be uncomfortable. All will pinch. ... Our choices are
potentially increasing taxes, potentially increasing the budget
deficit or some sort of deposit insurance premium increase.''
   ``You have to ask yourself what is the least obnoxious of all the
alternatives,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``I don't think it
should be precluded at this time. Some people want to put their
heads in the sand and pretend there's no problem or pretend it won't
be costly to solve. But there's no free lunch.''
   Bank executives, in particular, promised to lobby hard against
the idea.
   ``Taxing bank customers to bail out the savings and loan industry
would be a gross injustice. Ford wasn't asked to bail out Chrysler.
Newark wasn't asked to bail out New York,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie,
executive vice president of the American Bankers Association.
   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the association, warned that
customers would end up paying even if the institution paid the fee
rather than the depositor.
   ``One of the things that will happen is that interest rates on
deposits will have to go down if the tax is collected through the
banks. A 5{ percent rate will become something like 5 percent,'' he
said.
